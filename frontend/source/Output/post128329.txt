Can not share WiFi from Macbook Pro to other devices via Bluetooth PAN <body> First of all, this problem is detailed in this discussion at Apple's forum.  I basically have the exactly same problem.  Status indicator is always yellow under "Bluetooth PAN" in Network Panel.  The status says: codeBluetooth PAN has a self-assigned IP address and will not be able to connect to the Internet./code  I tried on both iPad and Android devices, doesn't work. There is an icon on the upper left corner of iPad indicates connected to Bluetooth PAN. However, there is no internet access.  Any suggestions on this issue?  <answer137345> I assigned it an IP and it started to work, don't know why it can't do it automatically.  This is what I did:  ol liGo to System Preferences - Network - Bluetooth Pan (you might have to create this one)/li liPress Advanced../li liPick "Using DHCP with manual address" for "Configure IPv4"/li liEnter an address under "IPv4 Address" (192.168.1.14 worked for me)/li liHit ok, hit apply./li /ol  <answer151557> Connected only means the devices are connected via BT pan.  Your WiFi connection to Internet is not been shared.  That could be caused by DNS server settings problem.   When you configured the IP settings "manually" did you set the specific DNS sever IPs respective to your strongI/strongnternetstrongS/strongervicestrongP/strongrovider (ISP)?  Also---Try going into network settingschange your location to a new one or may be create another?  <answer151993> I am not sure sharing an Internet connection over Bluetooth works on osx. If it does, it should work like this:  ol liGo to System Settings  Sharing /li liSelect "Internet Sharing" but do not click the checkbox yet/li lion the right, select 'share your connection from:' 'Wifi'/li libelow, check 'Bluetooth PAN' if it exists/li liNow check the Internet Sharing checkbox on the left./li /ol  If 'Bluetooth PAN' is not in the list, it is mybe not supported to share internet via bluetooth.  <answer244018> This is what i did:  ul lilooked up IPv4 address of the Connected Mac Computer in the Router Software (i am connected through Ethernet via Fiber)/li liEntered the IP address of the Connected Mac under Bluetooth PAN - Using DHCP with manual address  ul liin the same section i choose under IPv6 "only local-link"/li liclick "Apply"/li /ul/li /ul  Bluetooth PAN went from yellow to green and i was able to Reverse Tether the Internet Connection from Mac/Ethernet via Bluetooth PAN to Android Phone (Samsung Note 3 on 4.4.2) and iPad 1.   I am hoping that this is a stable solution.  <answer247157> I ran into the same problem when reverse tethering my Samsung phone (Android 5.1.1) to access the Internet connection on my Macbook Air (El Capitan), and found a successful solution:  ol liMake sure your mobile device is paired via Bluetooth and follow Heiko Haller's steps for Internet Sharing settings. /li liUnder System Preferences  Network, select the active Internet connection  (e.g., USB LAN) and note the IP Address, Subnet Mask and Router numbers. /li liSelect Bluetooth PAN in the same Network window, click the Advanced button  in the lower right to open its configuration panel./li liUnder the TCP/IP tab, select 'Manually' from the Configure IPv4 drop-down  menu, and copy the information from Step 2 in the three relevant fields./li liSelect 'Link-local only' next to Configure IPv6. /li liClick OK to close the Bluetooth PAN panel, hit Apply in the Network window./li liOn the mobile device, go to Settings  Bluetooth and click on the cog icon next to the paired Macbook and turn on 'Internet access'./li /ol  It's been a couple of hours and so far, the connection seems stable.  strongEdit:/strong An incoming regular call broke the connection, and unpairing and re-pairing the device appear to have restored it.  strongEdit2:/strong The IP Address and Router numbers may change each time you connect to the Internet, so be sure to update the Bluetooth PAN settings accordingly.  <answer275337> I followed the instructions above but the IP address 192.168.1.14 did not work for me.    I did however find a solution.  While the PAN interface was connected, I ran ifconfig in terminal.  There was a bridge interface with the IP address 192.168.2.1.  So I set my PAN Interface to match and reconnected.  Now it works!  <comment177612> Hi @Heinrisch.
