How can I get Messages app? <body> I deleted my Messages app but I'm not sure how to re-install it. What can I do? I'm on 10.9.1 by the way.  <answer120339> h3Use a backup/h3  If you have a Time Machine backup (or other backup of the system), you can restore the file from there. Browse to the folder in Finder and enter Time Machine, go back in time until the file is found then restore it.  h3Copy the file from another system or a trusted person's machine/h3  If you have a second machine with a comparable build of OS X installed on it, you can copy the file from it. Feel free to ask for the checksum of a file in chat to compare it to if you wish to make sure that the file is correct (not modified accidentally/purposefully).  h3Pacifist with OS X install media/h3  If you've got an OS X install media and Pacifist, you can browse the install media and grab the file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AU5g8.png" width="400" title="Open Apple Installers"  If you have Pacifist but no install media, it will prompt you to download the installer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NqOcj.png" title="No known Apple install packages were found on any inserted disks"  h3Reinstall OS X/h3  If you've got the ability to reinstall OS X through the Recovery HD, Internet Recovery or an OS X install media then reinstalling OS X will 'repair' your install and copy any missing/broken system files back to your system.  <comment140365> How did you delete it, maybe it is still there. <comment140367> I deleted it with AppCleaner. As far as I can tell it's gone, can't see it on my applications folder nor the launchpad. <comment140383> I'll try Pacifist, thanks. <comment140390> Did you keep a copy of the maverics installer (5.3 gig) use it.
