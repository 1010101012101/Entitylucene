Force Click to preview items in Safari doesn't work <body> I tried to change to tap with three finger and it works on all Safari, Mail, Note,...  When I changed to Force Click to Lookup data and defectors, it doesn't work on Safari, but every other apps go well.  What should I do to fix this?  I'm using macOS 10.12.4, MacBook Pro 15inch Late 2015  <answer282807> Well I restarted my Mac and everything works perfectly...
