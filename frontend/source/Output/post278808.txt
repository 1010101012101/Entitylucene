Macbook Pro mid 2015 (Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB) and Acer XR382CQK <body> Will my Macbook Pro mid 2015 with Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB be able to run the Acer XR382CQK at 3840 x 1600? I'm having a hard time figuring this out based on the documents Apple provides.  If yes, using what port and what will the refresh rate be?
