Can I set custom album artwork that isn't included in one of the songs? <body> I have a couple of albums in iTunes that are "Various Artists" compilations, and the kicker is that each song has it's own artwork.  Is it possible to add album artwork only to the "album", and not to any individual song, so that I'd see the logo for the game/album on the main iTunes/iOS album view, instead of the first song of the album's art?  <answer24774> Yes, you can do this a few different ways depending on whether you want to preserve the current artwork or are OK overwriting it.  strongWay 1 — Simple if you are OK overwriting the current artwork./strong  ol liSelect all of the songs you would like to share the same album artwork./li liType Command-I./li liYou may see a dialog asking "Are you sure you want to edit information for multiple items?" if so click, "Yes" to continue./li liYou will see a editor like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y02Q5.png" alt="iTunes Multi-song editor"/li liDrag the image you want as the album artwork for these songs onto the well labeled Artwork./li liClick OK and you're done./li /ol  strongWay 2 — If you want to preserve the current artwork./strong  iTunes allows songs to have multiple artwork files associated with them. It displays the first artwork file as the album art for a particular song. Here's the slightly more painful way you could add your artwork to these songs.  ol liIn the main iTunes window make sure that you have the small album art window displayed in the lower left. You can toggle it's visibility by clicking the icon near the bottom left that looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xhW1T.png" alt="album art toggle"/li liSelect the songs you want to add art to./li liDrag your new art onto the cover in the lower left. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zDjlF.png" alt="itunes cover art"/li liYour art has been appended to the end of the stack of images associated with this file./li liNow the annoying part: you have to open the info panel for each file by selecting it and hitting Command-I./li liFor each file move the new image to the top of the stack to make it the default album image and click OK. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ySxR3.png" alt="move the image"/li liOnce you complete step 5&amp;6 for each file you're done./li /ol
