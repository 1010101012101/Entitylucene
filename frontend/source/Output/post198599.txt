There is Wifi in my logout-then-login screen <body> I'm using Yosemite 10.10.4, if I start Mac(press power button and boot), everything is ok, there is user list in login screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxQaR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you click the user, then password input will appear, after input password, the user will login and login very fast.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Owv2Z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But if you logout, a different login screen with a wifi select bar will appear. And you have to input username and password, and it will take like 2 minutes to login. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mJ0Zy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Why the logout-then-login-screen different with the login-screen? How to make it display username same as the login-screen?  <comment237681> I assume you log out to switch the user ? <comment237699> Yes. That's right
