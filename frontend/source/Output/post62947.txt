How can I recover my MS Office 2011 product key? <body> I want to use Migration Assistant to transfer my data from a Macbook Pro to a Macbook Air. I'm told that I need my product key for MS Office 2011.   Is there a way to find my product key on my mac?  <answer62949> Depending on where you bought Office 2011, you can retrieve the product key from Microsoft using the instructions on their website.  If this doesn't work for you (ie. you probably don't own a legitimate copy of the program) I'm afraid you're out of luck, I believe the licensing information may be stored in the com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist file which is located in ~/library/preferences but it's encrypted so... good luck with that.  <answer104757> This is an old thread, but I ran into this issue and the way to fix it is as follows:  emYou have to be able to access the hard drive you migrated from.br Make sure all Office programs are closed./em  ol liOn the new hard drive/computer you migrated to, delete the following file:  precode/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist   /code/pre/li liGo to the HD you had a working copy on, and copy that emsame/em file from the emsame/em location to the new HD.  It should have an older date from when you installed it and activated it./li /ol  <answer108737> G/L trying to get a replacement from MS based on the Product ID. I just tried &amp; they want to charge $40 for a replacement key (the product is still only good for 1 license)  <answer218168> In case anyone needs to do this in Office v15, the file has changed to code/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensingV2.plist/code  <comment114708> The com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist file is at /Library/Preferences, not ~/library/preferences <comment171466> I found that I didn't even have to pull from the old hard drive to do this. I grabbed that plist file from one of my other computers at home and it copied over and worked. <comment186405> I got the hard drive replaced in my MacBook Pro. I cloned my old drive with SuperDuper when I resetored I had this problem. I have TimeMachine backups and I got an older version of this file, it didn't work. I'll try again. I have my clone and my old hard drive in storage, but I'm not happy there is no better way to retrieve my key. I could even boot off my clone and use Word, but those drives are in storage... <comment186406> There is also a file called com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist.lockfile do I need to replace that or not? <comment190426> After my migration, Office not only demanded my product key but then rejected it and told me to reinstall. Copying across this plist allowed it to accept my product key and start working.
