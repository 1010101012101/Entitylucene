Can I remove one partition on an external drive, while keeping the other intact? <body> I have an external USB drive, which I've partitioned into separate FAT32 ("MOVIES") and OSX ("TIME_MACHINE") partitions:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zNuUr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I now wish to remove the FAT32 partition and just use the OSX partition.   Aside from reformating the disk with a single OSX partition, is it possible to:  ul liremove/erase the FAT32 partition, then/li liexpand the OSX partition to take up the entire drive/li /ul  without losing the contents of the OSX partition?  <answer142092> Disk Utility can't do it, but iPartition can - http://www.coriolis-systems.com/iPartition.php  Tested on both GUID &amp; MBR formatted drives.  <comment167406> See [Partitioning Software](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101928/partitioning-software) <comment298592> The whole drive died in the end, which was one way to resolve the issue... <comment337342> Is there any similar and free solution? I probably only need to resize once <comment337355> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/101928/partitioning-software/268637#268637 for a more comprehensive answer
