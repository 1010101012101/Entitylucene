My notifications center is full of the settings for strongextremely useful/strong applications (Calendar, Evernote, Maps, Skype, Dropbox), and thenâ€¦ ema website I sometimes read/em.  I can easily set their notifications to "None" but I want:  ol liTo know how they got there in the first place. I'm sure I never opted in to this./li liHow to completely remove it from my system/li /ol  Anyone?  <answer206267> You can check if you have desktop notifications enabled in Safari. Go to strongSafari Preferences  Notifications/strong. If the site is listed in there, remove it.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2iHJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment248667> that was it, thanks. interesting that it was there, because I don't remember ever reading techcrunch on safari (I dont use it much). any idea how it would have gotten there?
