Would using thunderbolt-to-hdmi help? <body> Late 2013 Macbook Pro 15.4" 2.6Ghz  I connect HDMI and not always do the full spectrum of resolutions appear within the list of choices?  codeSystem Preferences (app) -&gt; Displays (preference icon) -&gt; Display (tab) -&gt; Scaled (tab)/code   What would cause this?   Monitor is more of a TV I guess: Seiki 4K 39-inch.   Even if 4k would perhaps cause a problem, 1080p, 1080i, and even 1440x900 failed to appear a good portion of the time.  Is this perhaps a hardware issue with the MBP's HDMI port?  Would it help if I used the thunderbolt-to-HDMI cable instead? Perhaps because of a faulty HDMI port maybe?   <answer257756> h1Option+click codeScaled/code/h1  You can toggle between Apple’s easy-to-understand “Larger Text”–“More Space” icons mode and the other mode listing specific resolutions. To toggle, hold down the Option key while clicking codeScaled/code radio button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L0xjb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DFeax.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h1Retina/h1  As for that comment “Don’t used scaled.” on the Question, that is wrong advice. Scaled options are Retina-style by default, more commonly known as codeHiDPI/code. Note the checkbox codeShow low resolution modes/code in the second screen shot above. Checking that box and choosing a resolution listed with the notation code(low resolution)/code means you are disabling the Retina feature and scaling up the image crudely (wasting pixels).   <comment148728> Don't use scaled.
