Homebrew git reporting older version <body> I have just upgraded git. It's now a symlink to the Cellared most recent version.  precode$ ls -l `which git` /usr/local/bin/git -&gt; ../Cellar/git/2.14.1/bin/git /code/pre  However  precode$git --version git version 2.11.0 (Apple Git-81) /code/pre  Do I have two different versions installed at once? How can I clean up the remnants of the Apple Git-81 version?  <answer294925> In code~/.bash_profile/code you should amend codePATH/code to prefer binaries supplied by homebrew. You can do this with the line:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  After changing code.bash_profile/code you will need to open a new Terminal.app window to see the change take place. Alternatively, you can codesource ~/.bash_profile/code to load in the profile into the current session.  <comment372212> Are you issuing these two commands in the same Terminal session? What appears for `which git` in a new Terminal session?
