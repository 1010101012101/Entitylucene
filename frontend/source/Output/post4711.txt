OSX: Is there a way to change the default behavior of copy/move overwrite? <body> Problem: Many of my friends are moving to OS X and are frustrated that, unlike Windows and *NIX systems, copying/moving a folder (with sub-folders) deletes the destination folder strongif/strong a folder of the same name already exists at the destination.  Question: Is there a way to hack the system (or install a plugin?) so that it by default copy/move operations strongmerge/strong the source and destinations instead of outright wiping out the destination and everything inside (with no option for recovery)?  <answer4719> strongEDIT/strong: Based on your clarification, you're looking to merge two directories. See this question for more information. There's no built-in way to do that using the OS X Finder.  As an alternative, you could try using standard unix tools like codersync/code, which are available via the command line. But this is not a very "Mac like" solution.  hr  I'm not sure what you're asking, because when you copy a folder from one place to the other, nothing is deleted at all. I assume you're talking about copying a folder from one location to another where ema folder of the same name already exists at the destination/em? If so, The Mac OS X Finder will show you a warning, it won't delete anything without your permission.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6orw.png" alt="Example"  If that's not what you're asking, please edit your question to clarify, and comment on this answer asking me to update my answer. Thanks!  <comment4605> I added clarification :) Yes it warns you, but merging is what i'm after here. In Windows you also get a warning (and a warning for every file/sub-folder) before you over-write something. OSX outright deletes EVERYTHING at the destination. <comment4607> possible duplicate of [Why does copy replace stuff instead of merging it?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1470/why-does-copy-replace-stuff-instead-of-merging-it) <comment4625> Exact duplicate of that question :-) <comment4628> Well, not exactly. The accepted solution suggests a complete Finder replacement, which are generally not free. I'm looking for a system hack just to get around this one "feature". <comment4666> There is no "system hack", you'll need to install third party software or use unix tools. <comment4694> How can you be so sure? Are you the whole world? Unix is running down below, there's _gotta_ be a way! _\*naivelook\*_ ;) <comment4701> @glenneroo: regardless, if there is, it would show up as an answer to the other, duplicate of this question :) <comment4710> @glenneroo: There's nothing built in to the OS that supports this. Sure, I could be wrong, but I am 99.99% sure that you'll need third party software for this. A good portion of "system hacks" are actually properties which can be enabled with the `default` command, and there's nothing under there that does what you want. :-( <comment4717> Fair enough. Is it OK if I leave this open, in hopes that one day some hacker-hero will ride in and save the day? <comment4813> @glenneroo: of course.  we can't force you to close your own question.  on the other hand, voters or a mod might do so :P
