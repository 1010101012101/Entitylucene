Suggest for each word I typed alternative words that are pronounced similarly <body> I am looking for a program running on Mac OS X that can suggest for each word I typed alternative words that are pronounced similarly. I'm mostly interested in texts written in English.  Example with Dragon NaturallySpeaking:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXsWd.png" alt="enter image description here"  My use case: I use speech recognition to write most of my texts, and I would like to have an efficient way to correct words that haven't been transcribed accurately. Some speech recognition programs provide a way to correct words but I'm looking for alternatives.  Ideally:  ul lithe proposed words should make sense in terms of language models./li lithe user may define alternatives for specific words (e.g., when a word is often transcribed inaccurately)/li /ul  Any price or license is fine.
