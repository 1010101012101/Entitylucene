Add QWERTY (language-agnostic) software keyboard on iOS <body> I have a problem with adding a language-agnostic QWERTY (software) keyboard on an iPhone 4S. On my iPhone 5S and my iPad Air I have added this QWERTY keyboard which is like the regular English (US) keyboard, but which doesn't do spell checking, etc. I know I can turn off spell checking completely, but this isn't really a solution, since I use the phone to write in English, and I use the spell checker.   FYI, here is how my Keyboards screen looks on the iPhone 5S:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCa7N.png" alt="enter image description here"  On the iPhone 4S, I cannot add the "QWERTY" keyboard.  strongEDIT/strong: None of the devices mentioned are jailbroken.   strongEDIT 2/strong: My locale is set to Slovenian (Slovenia), in case it makes any difference.  <comment134294> You presumably are talking about an iphone you have jailbroken in some way, right?  Is there perhaps a forum connected with whatever method you used to do that? <comment134337> No, the QWERTY keyboard pictured above is built-in. None of my devices are jailbroken. <comment134347> Interesting!  I have no such keyboard available on my iPad Mini 7.0.4 and have never heard of it before. <comment134387> Yes, it doesn't show up on mine as well, that's the problem :) <comment134412> Apple doesn't normally vary software this way, but it may be that only certain devices have that keyboard as an option. <comment134498> Other than reset or restore there isn't much you can do to fix something that doesn't work on an ios device.  Have you tried those. <comment134514> I have tried restarting it, but not restoring it.
