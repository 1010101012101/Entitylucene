ReadItLater-type app that saves web articles but also allows highlighting? <body> I use Pocket and I love it as a way of saving articles to read them later, and how it allows me to browse, search, and read them easily.   However, when I read articles, I like to create highlights (in yellow) and add annotations. Pocket doesn't offer highlighting.   There's a great OSX app for PDFs, Skim, that highlights and annotates perfectly when I'm reading a PDF. But it would be so much better to not have to convert a web page to PDF in order to highlight and annotate it.   I would like to be able to create my own library of archived web articles (like Pocket allows me to do) that I can tag, search, and mark up.   Is there a "read it later" type app that will allow me to create my own library of archived web articles that I can then highlight and annotate?  <answer128072> Yes there is. It's called dotdotdot and it's not as polished as Instapaper, Pocket or Readability but shows promise. Visit their site at dotdotdot.me  <answer131104> A recent update of Instapaper (May 8, 2014) allows highlighting. Any highlights you create are saved into your saved version of the article and are visible online as well.  <comment155545> Instapaper doesn't even have an OSX client does it? <comment155552> That's true - there are no clients for OSX, Windows or Linux. However, I use the online version of Instapaper.com to save and read articles too, and the online version supports highlighting as well (see http://blog.instapaper.com/post/85125160146). <comment345589> Yes, there is a 3rd party macOS client: [ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com/)
