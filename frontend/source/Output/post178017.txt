New terminal to same directory <body> When I have a terminal window open, ⌘N opens a new one.  Is there any way to get the current directory in the new window to automatically be the same as it was on the window where I pressed ⌘N?  <answer178028> The problem is that Terminal doesn't know anything about what directory you're in.  But the shell does! So you can type: codeopen -a /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app ./code and it will open a new window on your current directory.  If you want to do this a lot, put the following in ~/.bashrc: codealias openhere='open -a /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app .'/code. Then, all you will have to type is "openhere" to do the same thing.  <answer178036> If you hit ⌘T in the Terminal, it will open another tab, which will be in the same directory as before :-) You can easily switch between the tabs using keyboard shortcuts too - ⌘-Shift-[ and ⌘-Shift-]  Enjoy!  <answer178042> To accomplish this within a new window, go to Preferences within Terminal.app.  Within the General tab, you can adjust the behavior (you likely want to select strongSame Working Directory/strong) for both new windows and new tabs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OjSq1.png" alt="Preferences"  <comment210790> Oh, looks like I already had it enabled but must have messed it up somehow in my .bashrc. Thanks! <comment210828> Terminal does know your directory. The shell reports to Apple Terminal whenever directory changes; the code that enables this is in `/etc/bashrc`.
