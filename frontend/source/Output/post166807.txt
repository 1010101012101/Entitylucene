How to create a Mac bootable gparted or Parted Magic thumb drive? <body> Is it possible to create a Mac-bootable thumb drive containing gparted or Parted Magic without installing a full Linux distribution?  I tried several methods like  ul liunetbootin (some blogs suggest this though the unetbootin site explicitly mentions that it isn't possible)/li licodesudo dd if=/.../.iso of=/dev/rdiskx/code/li /ul  which both failed.  <answer217190> You need to use an alternative boot manager such as rEFInd, then either method will work.  Note that you also need to use a USB keyboard and mouse (or built-in on a laptop) for initial installation/use â€” Bluetooth pairings that work within the EFI boot manager won't persist once you boot Linux.
