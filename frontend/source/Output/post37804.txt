Start program in response to system events (like ip address changes, etc.)? <body> I want to start a program in response to system events, such as:  ul liIP address changes/li liWIFI connectivity changes (whether I'm connected, and/or which network I'm connected to)/li liVolume (as in disk) changes/li liUser logs on or off/li liSystem shuts down or restarts/li /ul  Is there anything built in to do this, or is there a 3rd party tool that can do this for me?  <answer37866> ControlPlane has many of the functions you're looking for, though I don't think it has any rules for connected users.  I've been using it for a few months on my work MBP to switch between home and office and it's been quite good.  <comment65092> any programmatically way to do this?
