My iPhone 4 won't send text messages! <body> My iPhone is not sending text messages through. It will take a long time to send (progressing the little bar at top very slowly), then it says "Message not Delivered". Why and how can I resolve this?  <answer178963> I had the same problem, there are two things you can try:  ul liIt is possible that your carrier's network is having problems. The best course of action is to see whether the problem goes away after a day or two/li liHave the person you are trying to message send you a message to your phone and reply then to see whether this fixes the connection issues/li /ul  <comment190882> I have had this issue when I use certain people's wi-fi; however, in the case of cellular I'm not sure. <comment190887> Do you have functional internet connectivity? Do you receive texts? Did your Apple ID change? <comment190910> Could be your sim card, you can check if that is the problem at a telecom provider <comment190920> 1. Does it work with some people and not others? 2. Have you tried rebooting your phone?
