Mapping home key - supported all apps? <body> I'm using the following technique to remap the home and end keys to make them work like windows:  precode~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict  { /* Remap Home / End to be correct :-) */  "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";                   /* Home         */  "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";                         /* End          */  "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:"; /* Shift + Home */  "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";       /* Shift + End  */  }   /code/pre  http://lifehacker.com/225873/mac-switchers-tip--remap-the-home-and-end-keys (ie go to start and end of text row)  This doesn't appear to be supported in all apps (ie TextEdit)  Is there a different way to make this work in other mac apps? (ie is this technique obsolete on OS X Lion?)  <answer83284> It should work in TextEdit and 10.7 / 10.8. Did you reopen applications after saving the plist? It looks valid, but you can check for syntax errors with codeplutil ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code.  DefaultKeyBinding.dict does not work in other applications like Xcode, Firefox, or Photoshop though. Another option would be to use KeyRemap4MacBook:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mRjr.png" alt=""  You can customize the setting group by copying it from the source to private.xml.  <comment95918> Thanks for your answer Lauri - could you clarify re the plist? Are you referring to the data structure in the .dict file? <comment95928> Yeah, .dict is an alternative extension for .plist. The DefaultKeyBinding.dict in your question is an [old-style property list](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/OldStylePlists/OldStylePLists.html). <comment95982> Have you got an example of what a new-style mapping would look like? <comment96012> It's just XML, like [this](https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix/blob/master/custom/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict). Or I guess you could edit DefaultKeyBinding.dict with Xcode and save it as binary.
