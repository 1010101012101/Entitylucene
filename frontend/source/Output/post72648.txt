After sleep, Messages doesn't consult Keychain for passwords <body> My MacBook will often sleep while I take a break, and when it wakes up, Messages doesn't consult Keychain for passwords. Instead, I'm prompted for all of my passwords again.   Why is this? Is there something I can do to fix this?  <answer72670> Try:   ol liDisk Utility to verify volumes and repair permissions on the startup volume, then Keychain Access to verify or repair the keychains/li lirun Messages/li lisleep then wake the computer/li liif the problem persists, remove relevant items from keychains then allow Messages to replace the items. /li /ol  <comment84378> What's the relationship between system file permissions and the problem? <comment84381> Wonder whether something is not permitted to access the item in the keychain. <comment84386> Apple just posted an update recently that fixes "issues with Keychain" actually. <comment84413> OK – [OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2 Supplemental Update 2.0](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1611) on 2012-11-20 for all Mac systems introduced in 2012, let us know whether it's applicable and whether it resolves the problem. Thanks. <comment84414> Yes, the update seems to have fixed the problem.
