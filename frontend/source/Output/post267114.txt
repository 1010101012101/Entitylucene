Provision Apple ID details with Apple Configurator <body> I have about two dozen iDevices, wild mixture of all OS versions, we use for app/web development/testing. In order to ensure a "clean slate", I want to reprovision them periodically using Apple Configurator. That works so far so good, but Apple Configurator does not allow me to specify Apple ID (aka iCloud) credentials and the PIN code - I want these to be the same across all the devices because they're shared anyway...  Is there a solution for this problem? Oh, and if it helps, I have a Mac with macOS Server installed.
