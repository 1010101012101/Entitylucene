MacBook Pro Input/Output audio not found <body> I have an audio problem on my MackBook with the following specifications:  ul liMB Pro Retina (13 inch Early 2015)/li liOperation System: macOS Sierra 10.12.5 /li /ul  Here is the chronology of the problem: Initially, everything was okay. I could hear music from iTunes on my MBP connected with a cable to an external speaker. Then I accidentally unplugged the cable on the speaker, so I plugged it in again but then I couldn't hear sound from my MacBook anymore.   I have tried the following solutions to address this:  ol liRestarting my MacBook/li liReinstalling my operating system/li liResetting both NVRAM and SMC/li liPlugging and unplugging to/from the audio jack on the MBP/li liKilling coreaudiod on Activity Monitor/li liDeleting the apple.bezleservices.plist file at code~Library/Preferences/com.apple.BezelServices.plist/code/li liTaking it into Apple Store Service near my town/li /ol  The Apple Store said it was a hardware issue, but I'm not sure on this. So, I went home to try the various "non-hardware" approaches above.  strongFYI:/strong My iTunes and Siri also don't work. Playing a song in iTunes shows no song progress. If I try to use Siri I get a "no audio found" message.  Below are various screenshots of my problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MN2Vz.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongMy questions:/strong  ul liHow can I troubleshoot this further? /li liIs there a way for me to narrow down whether or not this is definitely a hardware issue?/li /ul  <answer288610> I just experienced a similar problem.  I discovered that when I plugged in my external speakers (in the radio plug port), my System Preferences defaulted to a lower volume output setting (presumably to prevent blasting out too much volume in small speakers).  Try opening System Preferences and resetting the output volume to a higher setting.  <comment364386> @Monomeeth: thank you for editing, English is not my primary language. :-) <comment364490> In the system preferences the output volume is disable with the mute option is checked as you can see in the screenshot <comment364712> Of course the output volume is disabled when the MUTE button is checked. That's why it's called MUTE. Unclick the MUTE button. <comment364810> I can't click it since it is disable as well
