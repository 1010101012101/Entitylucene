Can I download apps on my iPhone 4s without a SIM card installed in my phone <body> Was just wondering if I can download apps on my iPhone 4s if I haven't a SIM card in my phone at all just download the apps onto my phone  <answer158779> Yes, you can download apps on your iPhone 4S without a SIM card.  Without a SIM card, you'll get an annoying-but-harmless "No SIM Card Installed" warning every time you restart. Also, if it's a GSM iPhone you'll be unable to restore the device from iTunes if necessary without at least temporarily installing a SIM card. For those reasons, you may want to consider leaving an inactive SIM card in the phone.  <answer158790> The issue is not the SIM card but if the phone is activated. If it is activated, what you have is basically an iPod touch. As long as you have an iTunes account that you can sign into on the phone you can download anything that is compatible with the phone and the version of IOS on it.  Also, you can often just walk into a phone store and request a SIM card. I have successfully gotten spare ones from my local ATT store. But then I am a customer. But it is worth a try, even if you don't activate it on whatever network it used to be on you get rid of the SIM card error.  <comment186656> Thank you very much but as for leaving a inactive SIM card in the phone I don't have a SIM card in it at all cause I bought the phone online but was just wanting to download Facebook messager and such on the phone but wasn't sure if it would let me without a SIM card in the phone now my next question can I download one of the free text apps without a sim card <comment186678> Is it a GSM or CDMA model? If it's CDMA, you won't need a SIM to activate. If it's GSM you will, at least temporarily.
