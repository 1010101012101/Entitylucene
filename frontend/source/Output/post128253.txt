Sync custom App Shortcuts via iCloud <body> I know that with Mavericks and iOS 7, iCloud syncs text shortcuts automatically across devices. Does iCloud also sync custom Application specific Shortcuts across Macs?    Application specific shortcuts: img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/tvdkvo4fyfd6u61/app_specific_custom_shortcuts_pref_pane.png" alt=""  <answer128254> strongNo, App Shortcuts are not synced over iCloud./strong  The shortcuts are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences, so if you want to sync them you are free to symlink this through Mobile Documents, however that file contains many preferences outside of just your app shortcuts.  <comment150211> Are symlink is the links I get via the context-menu at the "Make Alias" option? <comment150214> @Lukas No, see [How can I create a symbolic link in Terminal](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115646/how-can-i-create-a-symbolic-link-in-terminal) <comment150216> Thank you! But wouln't it cause some problems when syncing system preferences like display settings and so? Would it "sync" all settings are just some? <comment150217> @Lukas Indeed, all the settings stored in .GlobalPreferences would be synced which is probably a bad idea. <comment150218> Are all settings in the .GlobalPreferences? The Startup Disk for example is saved in the PRAM, which settings would be synced, which wouldn't? <comment150219> @Lukas There isn't a canonical list of settings that are in .GlobalPreferences or are in their own property list. A majority of OS X settings are in there but not many app settings. Feel free to have a look through though. Note that syncing the .GlobalPreferences is very bad if you have two Macs attempting to write to the file at the same time â€” iCloud doesn't handle synchronous modifications well at all.
