iPhoto does not open a window after Lion Upgrade <body> iPhoto is not properly anymore since I upgraded on Lion. It starts and seems to be alive in Task Switcher or in the Menu Bar, but there is no open Window for iPhoto.  I re-installed from the AppStore several times, (after deleting it), but I can not open a iPhotoLibrary.  This is the console output:   precode24.07.11 14:48:12.874 iPhoto: *** NSMapInsert(): attempt to insert notAKeyMarker 24.07.11 14:48:15.000 kernel: (default pager): [KERNEL]: ps_select_segment - send HI_WAT_ALERT 24.07.11 14:48:15.000 kernel: macx_swapon SUCCESS /code/pre  Any idea what I could do next?  <answer18529> iLife(iPhoto is part of iLife)does not come with Lion you have to download it separately, make sure it's installed XD  <answer35911> Just find and move to the trash the next file (preferences of iPhoto) code/Users/youracount/Library/com.apple.iPhoto.plist/code  then, open iPhoto.   Works for me.   <comment20361> Do you think re-installing iLife (from the DVD) makes a difference compared to re-isntalling just iPhoto from the App Store? <comment20414> I think you can install iLife from the DVD & then it will probably update to be compatible with 10.7. I haven't tried it myself but it worked with iWork so I don't see why it shouldn't work with iLife. I recommend trying to install from the DVD first before buying the app from the App Store <comment20435> Thank  you very much. I deleted iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand, deleted all iPhoto-related files and folders in /.ibrary and user/Library and re-installed from the CD!
