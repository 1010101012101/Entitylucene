Macbook Pro 17 Early 2008 - Mountain Lion - SSD Slow Performance <body> I have noticed significant performance degradation on my Samsung EVO running on an Old Macbook Pro, Intel Core 2 duo. Are there any SSD tips that I should apply to this hard drive? Will Trim Enabler make things quicker?  <comment178806> What do you exactly mean with slow? <comment178807> Did you build it into the CD slot or did you replace your HDD? <comment178808> HDD Replaced, Mountain Lion Clean Install. Overall lagginess after 2 months of usage, no trim enabled. <comment178810> Did you measure it's speed? Do you have SMART data available? <comment178820> yes. it's roughly 135MB/s on both read write speeds, as it's attached to a SATA 1 controller. Nevertheless, the overall issue is with lagginess rather than slowness. Mission control is kinda choppy etc. It was working fine for 2 months but it seems to have slowed down eversince. <comment178823> You should use smartmontools to check if your SSD is broken. <comment178826> can't find an OSX Binary. <comment178838> used smart utility instead, everything seems to be ok. Maybe my 7 year old macbook pro is dying.. <comment178839> Did you run Apple Hardware Test? <comment178870> 4vdc/1/40000003 <comment178871> http://s28.postimg.org/qznb3jzkc/Photo_21_10_2014_17_03_04.jpg
