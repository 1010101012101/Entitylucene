Is the gloss on iOS icons automatically applied? <body> Clearly it isn't completely automatic, as many icons don't have a reflection, but is there some sort of checkbox when creating an app to determine whether the gloss is applied?  <answer45806> Yes, it is automatically applied by iOS.   There is an option for iOS application developers to turn this off, called codeUIPrerenderedIcon/code. This is a value in the codeApplications Info.plist/code, that can be turned on and off (checking it would note that this is a pre-rendered icon, and to not apply the gloss).  You can read more details in the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.  Web Applications (as noted in Mathias's answer) also do have this reflection applied to them. You can override this by naming your file codeapple-touch-icon-precomposed.png/code. More information is also provided in the HIG for web clip icons.  <answer45830> jmlumpkin’s excellent answer is about native app icons. For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that there’s another type of “app” that can have home screen icons.  It’s a different story for web apps (which can also have touch icons when added to the home screen).  A web developer can add a touch icon to his website as follows:  precode&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png"&gt; /code/pre  iOS then automatically adds some visual effects to your icon so that it coordinates with the built-in icons on the Home screen (as it does with application icons). Specifically, iOS adds:  ul liRounded corners/li liDrop shadow/li liReflective shine/li /ul  As of iOS 2.0, you can prevent the addition of these effects by using the codeprecomposed/code keyword:  precode&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png"&gt; /code/pre  This is described in the Web Clip Icons section in the iOS HIG. There are some other gotchas that I documented in this write-up, but that’s the gist of it.  <comment52198> I've always wondered this, since they all like identical
