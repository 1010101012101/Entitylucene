Is there any way to set DNS server to all Wi-Fi in iOS? <body> I would like to set up DNS server in iOS, but as far as I know you must set it up manually whenever you connect to a new network. The example is here.  However, is there any way to set up DNS server without bothering to follow the same procedure whenever I connect to a new network?  <comment367584> Havenâ€™t tried it, but [DNS Override](https://www.dnsoverride.com) could be a step in the right direction. It seems to change the DNS both on wifi and cellular, but comes at a small fee.
