Why does my iOS device beep at noon every day? <body> I have an iPod touch (4th gen). A few weeks ago, it started making an alert sound (tritone) every day at exactly 12 noon. There is no on-screen alert, nothing in the Notification Center pull-down. Just a sound. Every day.  I have NO apps in my Notifications (Settings). I have NO alarms set. NO reoccurring calendar items.  Anyone have a clue why my device is doing this?  <answer103373> Under the app in the list, there should be a description of which types of notification an app can send. Look through the list for apps that say 'Alerts' or 'Sounds' and disable the 'Alert Tone' or 'Sounds' respectively.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vjq6N.png" width="300"  <comment121658> What do you mean by you have no "*apps in my Notifications (Settings)*"? Are you referring to the Notification Center, or the list of apps in Settings? If it's the latter, I don't understand how there can be **no** apps in that list since pre-installed iOS apps will be shown in that list, and they can't be removed… <comment121661> I mean in Settings  Notifications, the list under "In Notification Center" says "Empty". <comment121807> Yup. That was it, although I'm sure the I never allowed the offending app to set any notifications. Thanks. <comment122109> @KevinT Curious—what was the offending app? <comment136364> If you were like me, you followed all these directions and still got mystery beeps.
