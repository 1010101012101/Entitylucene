OSX Sierra: Can't add a google account <body> I'm experiencing the same problem as mentioned in this post here:  macOS Sierra Internet Accounts Google login stuck  I updated my OSX to Sierra and somehow can't add a new Gmail account in Apple Internet Accounts. It's pretty bad since I need it for my work &amp; private.  I deleted in the keychain anything related to google/gmail, i don't have 2 step verification installed and tried pretty much everything else i could find (e.g. access for less secure apps: ON / account access enabled). It works on my iPhone but not on my Macbook pro.  Any help much appreciated. Thanks in advance. Manuele  <comment343425> Let's keep the answers in one place
