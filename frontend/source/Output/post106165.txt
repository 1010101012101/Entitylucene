Chrome back/forward gestures no longer working after Mavericks update <body> Has anyone else noticed their 1 finger back/forward gestures no longer working in Chrome? I have tried the gestures on other applications such as Safari and Mission Control, they are all still intact.  <answer106207> Yes, I've noticed that too. I already reported that error to Google via the Chrome's codeOptions panel -&gt; tools -&gt; report errors/code.  Hopefully they'll fix it soon!  <answer106211> Make sure you enable: strongSystem preferences  Mouse  Swipe between pages/strong  <answer106354> Do you have Better Touch Tool installed?  If so, uninstall it as it doesn't play nice with Mavericks atm.  Also if you dont have it installed, I changed the tracking speed, as I had previously set it with Better Touch Tool.  I'm pretty sure it's not an issue with Chrome.  <answer106370> Make sure you enable: System preferences  Mouse  Swipe between pages  strongAND OPEN A NEW TAB/strong in Chrome  <answer108530> There is a bug report already on the Chrome forums. Check it out here and add your info too.  It seems to be a sporadic problem; I have the issue every hour or so, but my colleague doesn't get it at all.  <answer112575> Mine stopped working too, but realised I had installed a chrome plugin called 'SmoothScroll' (or something similar).  Uninstalling this gave me my gestures back, Happy times!   <answer128030> In System preferences  Trackpad  Swipe between pages (under more gestures tab) Uncheck it and recheck it.   Should work in Chrome now. You may need to do it when first installing Chrome or updating Chrome.  <answer156704> This is a Chrome bug which is fixed in the 64-bit Beta which I use. It's a beta but works fairly well, I haven't noticed any problems except the headbar occasionally not retracting in presentation mode.  <answer248312> I ran into this issue a while back as well.  When I looked at my Chrome extensions, I had one enabled called Smooth Scroll.  When I disabled that extension, my gesture swipe returned to normal.  Hope that helps.  <answer295307> I can confirm this annoying bug.   The magic mouse right swipe for "back" doesn't work most of the time, but does after swiping with the trackpad once.  Chrome 60 macOs 10.13 public beta 5  <comment126740> I didn't even need to open a new tab. <comment134289> works for me too! <comment138536> It worked for me by doing: System preferences  Mouse  Swipe between pages Thanks, couldn't live without it! :) <comment141313> Thanks Jac, SmothScroll is the culprit!! I disabled it on mine and got my swipe between pages back! <comment279633> i upgraded to el capitan to use magic trackpad 2, and it seems like the gesture changed from 'swipe with two fingers' to 'scroll with two fingers'. Make sure the gesture matches your expectations even after the Swipe between pages gesture is enabled.
