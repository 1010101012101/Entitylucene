Activation Lock on Ipad, Wrong Email and forgotten password <body> My Iphone was stolen last December 2014, so I activate my Find My Iphone in my Ipad. I also changed my icloud, apple id and the like.  It was going smooth until now. I can't use my Ipad-- it says Activation Lock and all. I need to enter my Apple ID and password.   The problem is, I forgot the password and the email I had entered doesn't exist.   please help me. :(   <comment320613> Try calling for apple service in your country and explain your situation. A collegue faced something like this, his iPhone was stolen and get activation lock on the new one, but he changed e-mail address and password no longer worked. A call to customer service and problem is solved.
