Can I use my computer's network connection on my Ipod? <body> I know it's possible to tether iphones to use their internet connection on the computer, but can it be used the other way? I want to use the computer's network connection on my Ipod Touch through the usb cable. Is it possible? Thank you!  <answer69870> Not exactly but you can use the computer's ethernet internet connection via Wifi to the iPhone.  In that case just go to emSystem Preferences/em  emSharing/em, then  ol liSelect emInternet Sharing/em/li liSelect emEthernet/em in the field emShare your connection from/em/li liFlag emWi-Fi/em in the field emTo computers using/em/li liGo to emWi-Fi Options.../em and select a network SSID and a security password/li liClick emOK/em/li liFlag emInternet sharing/em/li /ol  If you are using a pc with windows you can follow the instructions reported here. Basically:  ol liGo to Network Connections in your Control Panel by going to emStart/em  emControl Panel/em  emNetwork and Internet/em  emNetwork and Sharing Center/em and then click emChange adapter settings/em on the menu on the left./li liRight-click your Internet connection that you want to share (e.g., Local Area Connection) and click Properties./li liClick the Sharing tab./li liCheck the "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection" option. /li /ol  <comment81137> Of course, this assumes the computer has wifi.
