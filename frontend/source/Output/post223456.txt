Keychain won't let me Allow or Always Allow after 10.11.1 update 5 <body> I am having the same problem described in this question:  Keychain won&#39;t let copy passwords after 10.11.1 update  The difference is, I do not have any of the listed "helper" applications installed. So, I have no idea which application I need to grant total system Accessibility to make the stupid warning go away. Or which application to remove from my system, if that is the case.  I have tried adding several applications, but it only allows me to Allow a prompt once. Triggering the same permission prompt again results in the same "SecurityAgent[pid]: Ignoring user action since the dialog has received events from an untrusted source" notice.  I also notice my Console is repeatedly being flooded with notices like:  1/13/16 9:39:25.223 PM launchservicesd[pid]: SecTaskLoadEntitlements failed error=22
