open a file, hash string, and close - in MacOS X Yosemite <body> how do I open a file of strings, hash the strings, and close it in bash? I am using MacOS X Yosemite.  <answer208073> Your question is a bit short on details, but assuming that you have a file codeFILE.txt/code where all the strings which need to be hashed are on separate lines, you could run something like  precode: &gt; FILE.hash while read line; do     md5 -rs "$line" &gt;&gt; FILE.hash done &lt; FILE.txt /code/pre  This results in a text file codeFILE.hash/code containing lines like  precode5eb63bbbe01eeed093cb22bb8f5acdc3 "hello world" /code/pre  If you prefer to have the hashes without the text they represent, use  precode    md5 -qs "$line" &gt;&gt; FILE.hash /code/pre  instead.  <comment250986> What have you tried - and why in bash - a scripting language would be easier and what do you mean by hash
