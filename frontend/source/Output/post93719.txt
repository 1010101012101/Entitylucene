Run Makefile from Finder <body> I often travel using Finder in the source directories of various project (LaTeX articles, programming stuff) for which the compilation is piloted by a codeMakefile/code. I was wondering if there is a simple way (Service menu, Automator whatever) to invoke the corresponding command (codemake/code) in the good directory directoly from Finder (right-click something).   I'm running OS X 10.8.   Thanks by advance for your suggestions  <answer93761> Admitted, this is a clumsy way but maybe better than nothing:  create a text file named makeit.command and just put one line of text into it:  precodemake /code/pre  Then chomod the file 755  precodechmod 755 makeit.command  /code/pre  If you want to run a make, drag/copy it to that folder and then double click it.  <answer93762> You could use a function like this:  precodefmake() {   cd "$(osascript -e 'tell application "Finder"       POSIX path of (target of Finder window 1 as alias)   end tell' 2&gt; /dev/null)"   make &amp;&amp; make install } /code/pre  Or save a function just for the cd command and use history-search-backward to run something like codecdf &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install/code.  Or open Automator, choose the Service template, set the input type to no input, and add a Run AppleScript action like this:  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         POSIX path of (target of Finder window 1 as alias)     end tell     tell application "Terminal"         do script "cd " &amp; quoted form of result &amp; " &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install"         activate     end tell end /code/pre  Without the try block Automator would show an error dialog if the script exits with an error.  <answer94349> I like Lauri Ranta's AppleScript answer.  I was working on such a thing for myself to be able to use the Finder to locate a folder and create a git repository in a directory selected in the Finder.  I can see where you may want to call the make command on a folder as well.  It seems to me that it would be nice to be able to use the Finder's GUI and that you might want to do a lot of things with the selected directory.  Connect to Selected Directory  I think that this Automator Service is more general than issuing any kind of command for a directory inside of the AppleScript and it gets you ready to enter whatever shell command that you want to.   --- edit ---  I'm sorry, my post above didn't answer the original question. Here is a link to an Automator workflow saved as a Service that runs the make command on the directory selected in the Finder:   Run Make  I tried this new service of mine and I didn't like it because sometimes you may want to do the shell command "make" and other times you may want to do the shell command "make &amp;&amp; make install", or you may want to build a different target "make fullbuild" or something.  That's why I was thinking that a service called "Connect to Selected Directory" would be best.    <answer94356> I tried adding code#!/usr/bin/make -f/code as the first line of codeMakefile/code and making it executable but it does not run in the correct folder. So I've settled for a solution along the lines of the answer by The-Dood.  Open a terminal and go to the folder where you have you project and codeMakefile/code, then type this:  precodecat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; Makeit make -C `dirname $_` echo 'Press enter to continue' read EOF chmod +x Makeit /code/pre  Now double-clicking codeMakeit/code should invoke codemake/code on the same folder. You can add any other arguments when calling codemake/code or edit codeMakeit/code at will.  This solution works but it may not be terribly convenient because you need a copy of codeMakeit/code in each folder.  <comment109940> Not sure about 100% Finder `make`-ing, but, you could open a Terminal window and type `make` then drag the `Makefile` into the Terminal to copy the path to it. <comment110621> In that case what is the current directory? I don't think it will be where the Makefile is and so the make will probably fail <comment110622> How does this answer the question it appears to be general comments but no exact answer <comment110628> @2rs2ts, if you go this way, type `make -C ` before dragging the `Makefile`. <comment110651> @lhf Ah yes, of course. <comment110665> I'm sorry.  I meant to provide an exact answer with a link to finished code which when downloaded would install as a Service. <comment110676> Adding to @2rs2ts you do probably want the make in a terminal or from an editor to see the error messages <comment110677> You could also pipe the stdout and std to see errors or at least prompt where the error log is <comment111004> There is already a preinstalled service (New Terminal at Folder) that does the same thing as your second service. <comment111051> @"Lauri Ranta" Thank you.  You sure are knowledgeable.  I tried the Service "New Terminal at Folder" it didn't work for me, I think because I set a default directory in my ".bash_profile".  For some reason, my Service: "Connect to Selected Directory" works for me, but the Service: "New Terminal at Folder" does open Terminal.app, but it doesn't set the current directory correctly.  I get a current directory that is set in my ".bash_profile".
