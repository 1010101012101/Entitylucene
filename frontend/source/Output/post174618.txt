How do I get multiple cursors throughout OSX? <body> I enjoy using the Sublime Text 3 editorâ€”especially the multiple cursors feature.   I constantly find myself in need of the multiple cursor functionality in other OS X apps like Finder or Outlook. Does anyone know if this is possible and how to go about doing this?  <answer174619> Multiple cursors isn't a feature supported by Mac OS X by default. Some apps have it and if you want it in the rest of the system you will need too find an third part plugin.  I think it would be hard to make that work even with a plugin. But if you haven't already I would recommend giving Google a try in finding one.  Here is a link to an similar discussion on Super User: Link  <answer174621> Even though it theoretically could be hacked into the OS, most third party apps wouldn't work. You might have to edit things you need in ST3 or vim and have to see if the other apps like Outlook can import the files.  Alternatively, you might look for terminal versions of tools like mail tool like alpine or emacs such that rely on the keyboard control far more than a pointer/mouse/trackpad.  <answer246530> There's actually an app that does this:  Multiscreen Multimouse  I find it very useful for having multiple screens and having less "travel time" between them.  <comment205620> This isn't something that could be added in by an end-user, it would have to be added by the developer of each program. <comment304014> Welcome to Ask Different!
