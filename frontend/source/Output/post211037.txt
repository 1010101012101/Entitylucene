How can I close an ssh tunnel? <body> I have opened an ssh tunnel with codelucas-MacBook-Pro:~ donbeo$ ssh -D 8080 -f -C -q -N donbeo@149.157.140.64 /code  How can I close it now?  <answer211038> You have to type  precode~. /code/pre  to exit/close the ssh connection. I think  precodeexit /code/pre  also works.  <answer211039> You can kill the codessh/code process like others with  precodekill -9 $PID /code/pre  You can find codessh/code session process ID with  precodepgrep ssh /code/pre  <comment254746> can you post the full command? The connection is working in background <comment254747> Ah sorry, background process... So you have to check for the pid and use 'kill -9 id'.
