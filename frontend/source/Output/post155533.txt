Skype impossible to quit: where is this problem coming from? <body> I'm running Skype version 6.15 on Lion, and very frequently after a communication I discover I can't quit it with kbd⌘/kbd+kbdQ/kbd.  Within this situation the menu codefile/code displays the entry codeQuit Skype/code greyed.  Today here are the error messages as emitted by codeSkype/code around the end of my communication. But I can't be sure if this is related with the impossibility to quit the application since I can't fire it.  pre Nov  9 19:53:45 ••My_mac•• Skype[18309]: _CGSReferenceWindowByID: Window id 0xffffffff not found (locally or shared) Nov  9 19:53:45 ••My_mac•• Skype[18309]: kCGErrorIllegalArgument: CGSDeviceCreate: Invalid window Nov  9 19:53:45 ••My_mac•• Skype[18309]: Failed to create window context device Nov  9 19:53:45 ••My_mac•• Skype[18309]: CGWindowContextCreate: failed to create window context delegate.
