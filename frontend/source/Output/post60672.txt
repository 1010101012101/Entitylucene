Quarantine alert for Skim <body> I'm on Mountain Lion. Every time I double-click on a pdfd (pdf bundle) document, I get the alert saying that I'm opening Skim for the first time (which is, of course, false).  I've completely disabled the quarantine system. I also tried to reset the LaunchServices database.  How can I fix this?  <answer60974> Solved: I had to trash Skim, rebuild the LaunchServices database, restore Skim and rebuild the database once again.  <comment69847> Are you running Skim from its mounted dmg? <comment69848> No: it's in the Applications folder <comment73362> [Another question like this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/62708/why-do-i-have-repeated-are-you-sure-you-want-to-open-it-messages-when-launchi) was solved with `sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/$app.app`.
