Disable automount for ALL known and unknown disks at startup (macOS Sierra) <body> Is there a way to disable automount for all disks, not based on Volume UUID? I have macOS Sierra (10.12.3) installed on an external drive. Depending on the machine I am booting into, I don't always know the UUID for the internal disk and I need to have a way for the internal disk not to be mounted, or at least be mounted read-only.  <comment350827> Already tried [Disk-Arbitrator](https://github.com/aburgh/Disk-Arbitrator/releases)? <comment351109> Disk Arbitrator has to be running to stop/disable automount of the drive. Automount of the internal drive happens at startup before disk arbitrator is able to run.
