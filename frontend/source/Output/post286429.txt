Macbook Air SSD compatibility <body> I have a broken "early 2014" Macbook Air ( Macbook6,2 ) with a 512 GB SSD.br Is this SSD compatible with the current ( June 2017 ) models of the MBA?br Rationale is to not get the most expensive one as a replacement, but just the one with the smallest storage to save some cash.  Thanks!
