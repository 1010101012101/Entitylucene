Mapping Shortcuts to Modifier Key Functionality <body> Sometimes remapping keys for codetmux/code greatly improves quality of life, such as remapping the functionality of the modifier key caps-lock to control. Using 10.12.2 (Sierra), re-mapping the Modifier Keys via the Keyboard settings is simple (as shown in the below screen capture). What I'd like to do now is create a shortcut so that I can still use the caps-lock (functionality) by way of a shortcut such as simultaneously pressing shift &amp; caps-lock (key) or fn &amp; caps-lock (key). How is this done?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PbMFJ.png" alt="Modifier Keys..."
