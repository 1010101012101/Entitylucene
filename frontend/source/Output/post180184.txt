Mac Mini and Wide (21:9) Monitor / Display Port Issue <body> When I boot up my Mac Mini after moving it from my office at work where it worked with my wide (21:9) monitor to my house, when I boot it the display does not show up on the monitor anymore. Waits about 10 seconds and monitor goes to sleep. Monitor is the LG 29UB55-B.  The only thing I might have done in the meantime was connect it to my TV via HDMI. My question: is how does Apple want you to resolve an issue like this? If I can't get the display to show up on the monitor how do I tweak the settings? Is there a way to boot the Mac Mini into a low resolution mode? or something like that? I'm familiar with troubleshooting issues like this on the PC, but have lack of knowledge on how to start from a Mac Mini / OSX perspective. Thanks.
