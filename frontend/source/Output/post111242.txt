Keychain error -25308 while trying to add drive to Time Machine <body> I am trying to configure my Mac to use a time-capsule for Time Machine. After entering in the Time Capsule password I get the following error:     Keychain error -25308 occurred while creating a System Keychain entry   for the username "Bob" and URL   "afp://Bob@TimeCapsule._afpovertcp._tcp.local/TM"      You can try using the Keychain Access utility to edit or repair your   System Keychain   I've tried repairing my keychain, using the Keychain Access utility:  precodeRepair started Checking keychain configuration for Bob (user ID=501) Home directory is /Users/Bob Checked login keychain Checked password for ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain Checked settings for ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain Checked default keychain Checked contents of ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain No problems found Repair completed /code/pre  I even got desperate enough to wipe the drive and reinstall Mavericks, and it still occurs. I get the same error if I try and set it up to use a NAS instead of the time-capsule.  The time-capsule works for another Mac in my house. I've tried wiping the keychain and starting from scratch. Nothing works.  Does anyone know what I need to do to fix this?  <answer111482> I was having this same problem. According to discussion at this thread on Ars Technica, it’s caused by a bug in iStat Server. Are you running this?  I was, and can confirm that the work-around solution posted there of removing iStat Server and deleting the iStat Server entry in code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist/code has worked for me.  The relevant entry looks like this:  precode&lt;key&gt;DefaultKeychain&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;    &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;DbName&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;string&gt;/Library/Application Support/iStat Server/iStatServer.keychain&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;key&gt;GUID&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;string&gt;{87191ca3-0fc9-11d4-849a-000502b52122}&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;key&gt;SubserviceType&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;integer&gt;6&lt;/integer&gt;    &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Bjango, the developer of iStat Server, has further posted on the Ars Technica thread that a new version of iStat Server is now available.  I have not independently verified that this addresses the problem, since the above work-around had already taken care of my issue, but their release notes say simply “Fixed a Keychain issue.”  Both the new version and the release notes can easily be found at the iStat Server link above.
