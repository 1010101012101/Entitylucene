Upgraded to OS X EI Capitan and my Canon MG2240 will print but not Scan <body> I have uploaded the latest printer Driver for the 2240 ( mcpd-mac-mg2200-11_7_1_0-ea17_2-2.dmg ).   Not sure where to from here  Kind regards  Alan  <answer250593> It sounds like you may need to install software to run the scanner, which Canon seems to call "software" instead of "drivers."  This link will take you to the page where you can select what looks like a safe download. (Note: this link does NOT initiate a download.)  Just scroll down to the Scan Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NueW.png" alt="Scan Utility"  <answer250680> Patrix - On checking Printers and Scanners, the Printer is loaded and there is a tab Print/Scan and it was on Print. Changing to Scan has sorted out the problem. Silly me, but in the past I just had to press the Scan button on the Printer and she worked. So all sorted thank you very much.  As for the Canon software, I did download it and it works just fine and thank you too.  Thanks very much for the help guys, much appreciated.
