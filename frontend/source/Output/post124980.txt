Is it possible to play a Blu-ray Disc on iMac? <body> There is no any drive with my iMac and I know apple doesn't have program that could play Blu-ray until now, so can anyone give me some ideas about how can I make my iMac play Blu-ray disc movies?  <answer124981> You might to check out this MacWorld url.  There are several Blu-ray external USB drives available, but the url above will point you in the right direction.  <comment212469> I'm also a frequent Mac user who found the right Blu-ray tool including software and BD drive http://www.macblurayplayer.com/macgo-bluray-player-drive.htm
