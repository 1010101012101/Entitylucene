Command+Z stopped working in all applications <body> My kbdCommand/kbd + kbdZ/kbd stopped working. In any app. Including keyboard viewer.  Neither Left nor Right Command.  It's not hardware – kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdZ/kbd (or kbdCommand/kbd + any other modifier) works on both sides.  It's like something is 'trapping' that combo. What could it be? I quit Butler; that was the only shortcut app I had.  h2Update/h2  Strange … if I go to Keyboard Pref Panel  Shortcuts, and 'Add' an All Applications shortcut for Undo, then in that little window I strongcan/strong enter kbdCommand/kbd + kbdZ/kbd. But it still does not work anywhere else!  <answer238585> Whew! Found it! It was an errant hotkey in Synergy.  Had to go through every running app one by one and look for hot key settings.
