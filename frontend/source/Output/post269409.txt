icloud email doesn't work? <body> I tried to make an icloud email, or ID/account, but then it asked me to verify a code that I couldn't access until I signed in and checked my email. It wouldn't let me sign into my email however, without being confirmed. Has this happened to anyone else?  <comment338419> Are you sure it didn't mean to check your inbox of the previously existing email address you used to sign up for the Apple ID/iCloud in the first place? When I signed up I used my '@live.ca' account, it sent me my verification information to that inbox, and then once I was signed in to my Apple ID that's when it allowed me to create an iCloud.com email address.
