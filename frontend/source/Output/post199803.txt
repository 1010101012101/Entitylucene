Extending native spell check <body> When I use the messages.app, messages I type are automagically corrected/replaced. How can I enable this feature across many more apps like Chrome for example?   <answer199804> The system-wide spell-ckecker is accessed through System Prefs  Keyboard  Text... top right, 'Correct spelling automatically'...br  but I'm not sure Chrome doesn't just ignore it, it does most other things set system-wide.   If you look in the Edit menu in Safari, for instance, you'll see "Spelling and Grammar" &amp; also "Substitutions"br Chrome only has part of the Spelling and Grammar menu, &amp; Substitutions is missing entirely.  So, I think the strongTL:DR/strong is Chrome can't/won't do this.
