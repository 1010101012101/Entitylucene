Can I suppress the visual/audible bell in Mail when I press ⌥ (option) plus a symbol? <body> I've configured BetterTouchTool to allow me to toggle read/unread status of an email when I press ⌥/ (option slash, a convenient shortcut near the arrow keys), using the "Trigger menu bar menu item" action.  (See below screenshot.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OL345.png" alt="enter image description here"  The shortcut works—when I trigger it, the read/unread status changes.  (BTT is smooth as glass, I strongLOVE/strong it.)  However, Mail.app strongalso/strong makes an audible and visual bell (screen flash and a sound) when I trigger the shortcut.  It does this whether or not BTT is running or configured.  Is there some way I can suppress this bell sound and flash for this particular keyboard shortcut for Mail?  (I'm running Mail 9.3 on macOS 10.11.6, and BetterTouchTool 1.912 (523).)  hr  P.S.: I tried several other unbound keyboard shortcuts, without configuring them in BTT but just pressing them in Mail, and all made the same flash and sound.  I have no reason to think they will emnot/em make the same annoying sound if configured to actually do something through BTT.  <answer256482> Have you turned off strongSound Effects/strongbr /emSystem PreferencesSound/embr /br /Untick the box emplay user interface sounds/em effects img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xf0KV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment319956> I don't want to suppress *all* user interface sound effects.  They are quite handy when they're appropriate.  But when I am using a command I intend to use, I don't want extra noise.  Thank you, though.
