OS X prefers case insensitivity but TimeMachine seems to require case sensitivity? <body> As per What are the downsides to using Time Machine? the first item reads emTime machine requires an Apple specific HFS+ filesystem to store backups./em Which is a codeMac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)/code disk. But then, OS X of course wants codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code. Just like most everyone else I get:    emThis volume has the wrong case sensitivity for a backup./em    After hours of googling, I've not read that there is absolutely no workaround.  <answer223649> The linked answer doesn't say that Time Machine requires em...Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled).../em. It only says emTime machine requires an Apple specific HFS+ filesystem to store backups/em and it should be read as emthe Apple specific HFS+ filesystem/em.  With other words: Time Machine can't backup data directly to NTFS/FAT32 or EXT3/4 volumes.  <comment271154> Why don't you format your Time Machine target case-insensitive? <comment271155> @patrix The immediate problem is that I need to rollback to yesterday. I botched the Soundflower install. If I can't use TM, I suspect it will take a lot of care / effort to remove Soundflower. Once I get this Soundflower problem resolved, I'm definitely going to reformat TM to case-insensitive. <comment271158> I set-up TM years ago, and I knew Macs did not like case-sensitivity. I can't believe I chose case-sensitive. I thought maybe TM has some roll in formatting, and maybe that's what happened. If I can get my roll-back to yesterday to uninstall Soundflower, I'll delete 4 years of TM and start anew on a case-insensitive disk. <comment271160> There's no uninstall script. The only Soundflower file in my filesystem was the *.dmg file (which I deleted). Still, Soundflower shows-up in Audio MIDI Setup. I re-boot. Still in Audio MIDI Setup. I'm not well versed enough at OSX to really drill down and figure-out how audio works. I'm not sure and don't want to risk breaking something. I tried controlling the volume of 2 Bluetooth speakers with Soundflower. Didn't work. So, not the end of the world. <comment271162> yep. Uninstall.scrpt did the job! I need to learn more about GitHub... I think I had trouble with Soundflower because I'm using El Capitan.  I'm going to give Soundflower another shot sometime. <comment271163> @david The question above is about Time Machine. If you have issues with the uninstallation of Soundflower, please ask a new question for this instead of discussing it in the comments. <comment271167> @patrix I just want to acknowledge I'm no longer investing my time on this, so I don't want anyone else to either. I'm reformatting and making today "day zero" of my TimeMachine. That should do it. <comment271173> Invest the same amount of time to Soundflowerâ€¦ forget it & move on. Not worth the effort since Mavericks. Feel free to ask 'sound-related' further questions in Ask Different, though consumer-level workarounds for audio routing come down to one app, [Audio Hijack](http://rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/) which is expensive for a one-trick pony, but very good at what it does. [speaking as a sound engineer, rather than a Mac user]
