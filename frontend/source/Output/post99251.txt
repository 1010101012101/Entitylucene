How do I get my MacBook to charge? <body> I have an older MacBook - not the aluminium unibody, the white one. Bought in the US.  All of a sudden it has stopped accepting the charge. Once I plugin the MagSafe connector it goes to green immediately doesn't charge up the battery.  If I remove the MagSafe connector, it powers down the laptop.  I have tried resetting the SMC - per the instructions on Apple's support site. That doesn't work. Perhaps I am doing it wrong? Doubt it though.  I tried putting the battery in the freezer for 14 hours, that doesn't work. This computer was not in storage, it had been in frequent use before the battery just decided to die.  If the battery needed replacement, wouldn't putting it in the freezer for a few hours at least give me back emsome/em juice?  I have OS X Lion installed on the machine.  When I go to the 'Power' section of my System Report, it says that the Battery should be replaced now under Condition. The cycle count is 487 - based on my readings, this sounds low (no??).  Thoughts?  More info from the System Report on the Battery:  precodeCharge Information:     Charge Remaining (mAh):     0     Fully Charged:              No     Charging:                   No     Full Charge CApacity (mAh): 3416  Battery Installed:   Yes Amperage (mA):       0 Voltage (mV):        9448 /code/pre  <comment116685> How old is the battery? Battery have aging effect if they just sit around. <comment116688> Did you try cleaning the pins/connectors on the magsafe and the battery? <comment116690> There is more information in system report on battery, please report it, like mAh, Voltage ect... <comment116775> @Buscar웃 The battery is as old as the laptop - which is to say a few years. It hasn't been just sitting around, the computer & battery are used actively and were working fine before it just stopped working. I did try cleaning the pins/connectors on the magsafe - but not the battery. Just regular alcohol will work, right?  I am going to get more info from the system report on the battery and post it soon. <comment116776> @Buscar웃 I updated the question with that info you asked for. <comment116777> That is one dead battery :( ...RIP  it should say something like:  Charge Information:   Charge Remaining (mAh): 6166   Fully Charged: Yes   Charging: No   Full Charge Capacity (mAh): 6166   Health Information:   Cycle Count: 155   Condition: Normal   Battery Installed: Yes   Amperage (mA): 0   Voltage (mV): 8350 <comment116778> If you are up to "zapping" it, and have the skills and the tools try that. <comment116857> How do I zap it? I thought putting it in the freezer did that. <comment116869> Freezer has the opposite effect..ever got stuck with the car in the winter because it was to cold for the battery? <comment116870> The reason for battery life is something called Whiskers. They form during the life of the battery between the poles plates and shorten them. There is a DIY method (no guaranties and could be dangerous) to burn the whiskers off. That is done by running a 1/2 second high energy (30 Volts) pulse true the battery.
