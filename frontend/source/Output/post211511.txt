Restricted files on El Capitan? <body> So I wanted to hide the Finder icon on my Dock.  According to this answer - How can I remove the Finder icon from my Dock? I am suppose to edit DockMenus.plist file. When I tried I had no permission to do that. I tried to use codechmod/code (also with codesudo/code) on that file with no effect, same message from terminal - codeUnable to change file mode on DockMenus.plist: Operation not permitted/code. I ran codels -lOe/code on that file and I learned that apparently there is new permission flag called coderestricted/code.  I still don't know how to get permission to edit that file. Does anyone have any solution?  <answer211513> I have solved this issue only by booting to Recovery Mode (press kbdCMD/kbdkbdR/kbd during restart) and launching Terminal. This terminal doesn't care abour restricted flag on files. Also found answer here: How do I disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) AKA &quot;rootless&quot; on OS X 10.11, El Capitan?
