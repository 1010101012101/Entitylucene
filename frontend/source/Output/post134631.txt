Having trouble with a SMC reset <body> I'm having trouble with my built in iSight and I'm trying to reset the SMC. My MBP has a non-removable SMC, so the instructions ask me to press CMD-SHIFT-ALT-POWER at the same time, release it at the same time and then press the power button to power on the machine.  Trouble is that, the machine power ons when I press CMD-SHIFT-ALT-POWER and I dont think that resets the SMC. What should I be doing to correct this?  <answer134745> That is the incorrect key combination. You are pressing kbdCommand/kbd instead of kbdControl/kbd.  To reset the SMC on portables with a builtin battery, press (left side):  kbdShift/kbdkbdControl/kbdkbdOption/kbd + kbdPower Button/kbd  Subsequently, release them at the same time. Then power on your computer.   <comment159362> You have to take out the battery when doing this. Which MacBook do you have? <comment159392> MacBook Pro 13-inch Retina <comment159555> Strange, according to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFCF86GOFRI your procedure sounds correct.
