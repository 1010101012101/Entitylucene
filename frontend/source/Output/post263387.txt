Can I dual boot Ubuntu on a MacBook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar? <body> Question in title.   I know that the Touch Bar is not available for Ubuntu users, but that is fine. Will the rest of the machine work?   <comment329997> I am not certain that what the question is. Do you want to know if Ubuntu can be installed? Do you want to know if the touch bar works with Ubuntu? <comment330007> @SaaruLindest√∏kke I want to know if the Ubuntu can be installed. <comment330012> It can be installed, although the Touch Bar won't work. <comment330017> I'm not worried about the Touch Bar for the moment. Have you (@haykam) succeeded to install Ubuntu on that kind of MacBook Pro? How do you know this information? <comment330018> No, but others have. The Touch Bar wouldn't be a Touch Bar, but rather a function strip. The Touch Bar works independent of the OS. <comment330082> Could you provide proof of what you explained to me? A certain website or another guy who can provide his experience should be suffisant. <comment330167> I'll follow this procedure : http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs171/materials/pdfs/How_to_Dual-Boot_OSX_and_Ubuntu.pdf
