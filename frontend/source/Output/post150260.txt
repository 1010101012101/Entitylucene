Downloads folder is "in process" <body> Since about 2 weeks the downloads folder always has the loading line under it, even though there's nothing to download. Do you know what that could mean? There's no antivirus installed on the machine.      OS X Version 10.9.5    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TM0kc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer150262> This type of things happen when you try to download something from chrome, and close it before finish downloading. If it so, you can try the following steps.  ul liWent to Chrome - Downloads and clicked Clear all/li liRestart Chrome/li liRemoved the Download folder from the dock (by dragging it from dock to desktop) and dropped it back on there from your Macintosh/li liCheck your app store, Is there any pending download available or not. If so take care of it./li liRestart you machine./li /ul  Hope it will help you.  <comment176871> thanks! did not even have to restart the machine. <comment176872> Welcome...Even better. :)
