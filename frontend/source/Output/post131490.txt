Iphone 5s calender <body> It is not possible to enter new appointments on the calendar.  In the option to select different calendars, there is only the birthday calendar. How do i switch the other calendars on?   <comment154496> What kind of accounts do you have under "Settings=Mail, Calendar, Contacts" - and are the Calendar option enabled on each account ?? <comment154726> Hi Rene, only my yahoo account and my reminders and calendar are switched on. <comment154727> I cannot set any reminders either, it was working fine, don't know what i touched to switch it off. <comment154738> Try delete your Yahoo account setup under "Settings=Mail, Calendar, Contacts" - wait 10 sec. - and then create it again (be sure that you don't have any tailing spaces in the account username/password). <comment154747> Thanx a lot, it worked.
