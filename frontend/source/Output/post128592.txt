OS X Terminal not recognizing any commands <body> I recently tried to install CoffeeScript on my mac and now am unable to use even the most basic of commands like ls, cd and so on. Something tells me that it's because the $PATH variable has changed. I remember having to do that when I tried to make the installation. I tried following the instructions found here, but it doesn't work because the vi command isn't found.  Upon entering echo $PATH in the terminal, it reads /usr/local/bin:  <answer128594> To reset your path, remove the line that sets the path from your ~/.bash_profile or equivalent, then reopen your Terminal.  Edit it with /usr/bin/nano, or /usr/bin/open, or TextMate, or any other text editor. It's not that no command can be reached, but that the PATH doesn't include these binariesâ€”they can still be manually opened by providing the path or using cd to the directory.  <answer128595> It sounds like you removed or didn't configure your codePATH/code environment variable correctly. Try removing that line from ~/.bash_profile then open a new terminal window and verify that your paths are set correctly.  You don't have to use a command line text editor, you can use BareBones Software's excellent and free TextWrangler. This should reduce errors trying to figure out how vi works.  If you do not want to install another app, vi is located at code/usr/bin/vi/code. For command line editors I would recommend pico over vi code/usr/bin/pico/code which is much more user friendly than vi or emacs, but is clunky when compared to TextWrangler. Pico puts all of the relevant commands at the bottom of the editing window.  Good Luck!  <answer209987> You corrupted your codePATH/code variable definition. Without any indication of which method you choosed to modify it, I will make the hypothesis that you modified it within your code~/.bash_profile/code.  To recover from this situation, you will have to come back to a working shell environment and then try to fix correctly and test your code~/.bash_profile/code.  h2Recovery of a working code~/.bash_profile/code: none/h2  Remove your code~/.bash_profile/code and create a backup of it. Since your codePATH/code is not trustable, don't use it (use the full path of codemv/code):  precode/bin/mv ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile.bak /code/pre  Open a new codeTerminal/code window, within this one, every command should be found. Check that you recovered a working codePATH/code:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  If you find it easier, after this check, you could restart your session so that any new shell will get a working PATH.  h2Analyze what is wrong in your code~/.bash_profile/code/h2  precodegrep PATH ~/.bash_profile.bak /code/pre  h2Fix and test it/h2  Rather to fall back again with an unfunctionnal codePATH/code, use the backup file of your code~/.bash_profile/code to fix it there it and test it.  To test it enter:     . ~/.bash_profile.bak     echo $PATH  h2Put back in place the validated code/.bash_profile/code/h2  Once you are satisfied, and you checked you have access to all your commands:  precodemv ~/.bash_profile.bak ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  and if you want to use it immediatly without restarting your full session, just enter:  precode. ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  <comment150630> `cd` is a shell built-in. Nothing you do to $PATH should be able to break it, so quite possibly you've done something much worse to your machine. <comment150666> It is odd that `echo` works but `cd` and `ls` do not. Try opening Terminal preferences and making a new profile. Then make it run `bash --noprofile` and uncheck "Run in shell" (I think the options for this are in the Advanced tab). Also see if `type` or `which` work. <comment152093> You can use TextEdit.app which is part of OSX no need for TextWramgler <comment253396> To add to the @Wooble correct analysis, I think that `cd` is working and you thought it didn't because of `ls` not usable. I advise you to double check this information and upgrade your original question to avoid people wanting to help you to hunt for a martian :). <comment255550> Also, you can the path temporarily to test things before editing files that don't get read until you start a new session - http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208425/5472
