"git commit -a" causes "subl -w: subl: command not found" <body> i am not sure what is causing this problem but i am having problems using git. It seems sublime is somehow interfering. Does perhaps anybody know how to solve this problem?  I am running OSX 10.9.3.  precodegit version git version 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48)  git commit -a subl -w: subl: command not found error: There was a problem with the editor 'subl -w'. Please supply the message using either -m or -F option. /code/pre  <answer150497> The issue is that git commit is trying to use an editor to allow you to create a commit message. The editor for git is possibly overridden in is set in your code~/.gitconfig/code file. There will be a code[core]/code section which sets the editor  e.g. for Sublime Text  precode[core]   ...   editor = subl -w      ... /code/pre  remove the editor line to make the default editor go back to the shell's default editor  <comment177087> How are you telling git to use sublime text as an editor? <comment177088> I did not tell git to use sublime. As far as i remember i installed sublime and the xcode command line utilities which i believe included git. <comment177091> What is in the [core] section of ~/.gitconfig <comment177093> [core]   editor = subl -w <comment177094> I removed it, now it is working, thanks! <comment177107> @Susan, please write it down as an answer. This way other people can find your solution as well.
