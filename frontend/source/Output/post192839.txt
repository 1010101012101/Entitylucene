how to write a dock for mac? <body> I'am an iOS developer. I've never been interested in Mac development so I don't know anything about this. I wonder how to develop an alternative Dock to MacOSX's default Dock. I looked for Apple's documents but couldn't find anything. Is Mac's dock an application or a part of operating system? Where should I look to find a source? I want to write a dock for mac.  <comment229600> are you talking about something like this http://zurb.com/playground/osx-dock .... or something like this http://www.tekrevue.com/tip/the-complete-guide-to-customizing-mac-os-xs-dock-with-terminal/ .. <comment229604> no, I mean a completely different application like Mac's dock. I am not talking about something run on a web browser or a kind of customization. <comment229605> well, I guess found an example; http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/06/15/replace-your-macs-dock-with-tab-launcher/ <comment229612> did you look in here ? https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/Dock.html
