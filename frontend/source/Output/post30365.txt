IP Masquerading Mac OS X <body> I am trying to figure out how to use this command with mac os x  precodeiptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth2 -j MASQUERADE /code/pre  The only thing I have found that seems like it might work is  precodeipfw add m all from me to 0.0.0.0/0 /code/pre  but I get: codeipfw: invalid action m\n'/code  Does anybody know how I could translate the iptable code to mac compatible code?  <answer30534> You can try something like following. Please, read all details here. I hope this is working with non-server Lion (as FreeBSD nature of this OS), but I haven't tested it.   precode ipfw add 00010 divert natd ip from any to any via (ext int name here)  /usr/sbin/natd -config /path/to/SL/natd.conf.apple /code/pre  <answer50142> If you are just trying to share your internet connection, you can do this from System Preferences  Sharing  Internet Sharing  If that's not why you posted this and you still do it manually(see Eir Nym's post). Don't forget to:  precode    sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre  <answer112580> Below are the steps needed to set this up. codeen0/code in this case is the external interface:  precode/usr/sbin/natd -interface en0 /sbin/ipfw -f flush /sbin/ipfw add divert natd all from any to any via en0 /sbin/ipfw add pass all from any to any sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre  <comment40911> Why exactly do you have to do this?
