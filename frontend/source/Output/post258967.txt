Time Machine reporting thousands of errors: setattrlist failed for path '/.MobileBackups/Computer/ <body> For some reason, I can not longer complete a backup to a remote Time Machine server. In the error log, I see thousands of error messages. Here's generally what they look like:     2016-10-27 16:13:31.330679-0500  localhost mtmd[745]: (TimeMachine)   [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogError] -[FileAttrs   writeAttributesToItemAtPath:] setattrlist failed for path   '/.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-10-27-161316/Volume/Library/Preferences'   (errno 1)   The errors are slightly different only at the end (code/.MobileBackups/Computer.../code)  Ultimately, the backup takes days before the connection to the server is reset for some reason and the backup fails to complete.  What are these errors and what do I need to do to fix this?  <answer260125> It may relate to this and/or help someone else figure out more about this but when I look at directories that are subject to the failure on my Mac, I see:  precode    sudo ls -al@ '/.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-11-05-233040/Volume/Library/'     total 0     d------r-x@ 4 root  wheel  136 Nov  5 23:33 .         com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked     3          com.apple.s stem.Security    68     drwxr-xr-x@ 5 root  wheel  170 Nov  5 23:30 ..         com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUID     36          com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeLastFSEventID    20          com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeUUID     36      d------r-x  5 root  wheel  170 Nov  5 23:32 Application Support     d------r-x@ 4 root  wheel  136 Nov  5 23:33 Preferences         com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked     3 /code/pre  I imagine most of these file attributes are related to Time Machine's local backup process, but I also notice that one of the attributes is codecom.apple.s stem.Security/code .. note the blank character in the codesystem/code path component.  Could that be confusing things?  For example, if that attribute was emset/em with that typo and later emcleared/em (or attempted to be) with it spelled correctly, you would see an error like this.  Just guessing ..  <answer265158> I don't have a definite answer yet either, but I'm basing my approach on bad content/permissions in the code.MobileBackups/code subtree. Since these files store incremental backups in-between true Time Machine backups, I'm somewhat comfortable removing them and "starting fresh".  h3Viewing the logs:/h3  Missing from the question is how to emview/em the Time Machine logs. I installed a script in my code/usr/local/bin/code directory, based on the answer here. However, a more straightforward command is simply:  precodelog stream --style syslog --info --predicate 'processImagePath contains "backupd" and subsystem beginswith "com.apple.TimeMachine"' /code/pre  h3Investigating Logged Errors/h3  Inspecting the directories, there didn't seem to be much "off" about them (as @RamsayCons points out in his answer). Since I didn't care much about the most recent mobile backup, I decided to simply remove it:  precodesudo rm -rf /.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-12-16-112458 /code/pre  h3A few notes about this command:/h3  ul liRemember that with codesudo/code comes great power. Please be sure you understand exactly what you are doing before continuing./li liSimilarly, coderm -rf/code can cause great pain and anguish, so be sure that you are confident in what you are doing and have an exact directory specified./li liuse the command codels -la /.MobileBackups/Computer//code to list the contents of your existing Mobile Backups, so you can specify the correct /li /ul  hr  I am still waiting to see if this will resolve my problem, but so far I am seeing a new set of messages in the logs.   h3A few differences in my problem vs. that described:/h3  ul liI am backing up to a locally mounted drive, however, the problem seems rooted in the files stored in the code/.MobileBackups//code directory, and not related to "where" the TimeMachine Backup disk is located/li liMy errors include a message that codevolume Macintosh HD (/) is now in an emergency freespace condition/code, and codelow disk space thinning needed for volume Macintosh HD (/) with 7.7 &lt;= 10.0 pct free space/code, despite having code&gt;40GB/code out of code230GB/code free./li liMy Backup never "failed", but sat in the "Preparing backup ..." status in emSystem Preferences/em for over 18 hours./li /ul  h3Update:/h3  My Time Machine Backup eventually completed during the next scheduled hourly run... Hooray!
