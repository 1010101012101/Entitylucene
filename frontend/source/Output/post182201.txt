OSX partition failed <body> I stumbled upon errors when I tried to partition my HD for an ubuntu partition. First it kept saying codePartition Failed: Filesystem Verification failed/code That problem did disappear after a while. Probably when I repaired permissions. Then it kept saying codeCould not unmount disk "HD"/code  I tried unmounting disk manually, though that brought up codeFilesystem verification failed/code again.  <answer182202> There is a solution to your problem:  codeFilesystem verification/code can be stopped by booting to single-user mode, and then typing in order:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy reboot /code/pre  codeCould not unmount disk/code is because you are probably using it. Try booting from Recovery HD. If problem persists, boot Recovery from USB or use Internet Recovery to partition disk.
