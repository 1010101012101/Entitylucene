Publish an Aperture smart album to Facebook <body> I can easily create a smart album with the 5-star rated images on a certain date. I would like to share those with a Facebook photo album but the share command is greyed out when I have a smart album selected. What are some other techniques I could try?  <answer68398> Select the photos in the Album, see if that works for you.  <comment79618> If I could publish the Smart Album then I could republish it to FB when I add or change ratings. If I pick specific photos in the Album and I republish, then I will get duplicates in FB... However that might be my only choice. <comment79664> You can select all the pics in the Smart Album (Command-a) and upload them. Then apply a coloured label to them. Then as new photos are added the one not uploaded will be obvious as they have no label - so easier to update your FB album <comment79702> Good idea. thanks!
