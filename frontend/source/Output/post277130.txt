Embedding image in the signature but not in the main body <body> I have used the command   precodedefaults write com.apple.mail DisableInlineAttachmentViewing -bool yes /code/pre  to keep Mail from embedding attachments.   But now, also my signatures are changed so I can no longer embedding images in my signature.   Can I get both?  <comment348823> I'm assuming you want attachments to be inline as well as signatures? Please edit my edit if I missed the mark. It wasn't clear what you wanted (the end state) and this was flagged as unclear.
