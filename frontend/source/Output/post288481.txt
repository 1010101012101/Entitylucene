Is there a way for me to view my work or my whole iMac screen in grayscale? <body> I am working on a job that will be published in print and online in grayscale. Most of the creative work is being created in QuarkXPress.  strongMy problem is that I really need to see how this is going to look in grayscale./strong   Up until now I have been exporting the work to PDF in grayscale to see how things look, but as you can imagine this is a slow process.  strongIs there a setting anywhere in QuarkXPress 9.5.4.0 I can use to view my files in grayscale, or a setting within Mac OS X 10.11.6 that I can use to make my iMac temporarily display in grayscale?/strong  <answer288482> strongYes you can!/strong   Follow these steps:  ol liGo to Apple  System Preferences  Accessibility/li liIn the left hand pane make sure emDisplay/em is selected/li liOn the right hand side you’ll see a number of checkboxes and sliders/li liTick the emUse grayscale/em checkbox/li /ol  Your iMac’s display should immediately switch to grayscale mode.  strongTIP:/strong Since you only need grayscale while you’re working on this job, you can tick the emShow Accessibility status in menu bar/em checkbox at bottom left of the Accessibility preferences. This way you can access this setting as you need directly from the menu bar.  <comment364301> Wow!! This worked a treat! Thank you! :)
