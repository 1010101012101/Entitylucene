What are alternatives to EyeTV for watching live TV <body> I have an old Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick (800e) that I would like to use to record and watch TV using an over-the-air antenna. I know that some people love EyeTV, but it's a bit expensive and not very configurable as far as I can tell.  The ideal software would have some or all of the below features:  ul liInexpensive (price of software and price of program guide (EPG) subscription)/li liConfigurable recordings ("record every new episode of this show")/li liAutomated commercial removal from recordings/li liAutomated and configurable export of recordings (location, video format, file name based on program data)/li liLive TV or recordings streamed to other devices (Roku, iOS, web browser)/li /ul  I'm in the US and am looking to watch OTA HD TV stations (ATSC).  Does this unicorn exist?  <answer210116> No this unicorn doesn't exist.  I was looking to revamp my MacMini/EyeTv setup earlier this year and looked around quite a bit at alternatives. What I found was that cable and dish DVR's have pretty much destroyed the computer hobby market for TV along with DRM licensing costs.  I think the closest you're going to get are the boxes from SiliconDust or Hauppage. Both have DVR and sharing abilities, but their software is a bit more high maintenance than EyeTV's to achieve most of your programming goals.  I finally decided to stick with EyeTV for my DVR and live viewing. Fingers crossed that they will keep the software updated. I use the TitanTV program guide to manually schedule recordings. EyeTV still does an excellent job of exporting programs for archiving. Good luck finding auto commercial removal, the last company to try that, Replay, was sued out of existence.  <comment253028> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help centre](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic). <comment253059> @Tetsujin I disagree. This is a question about the fourth bullet point in the list of acceptable question topics: *third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.* <comment253420> Clarifying questions: I assume you are in the USA and are looking for over the air HDTV broadcasts? <comment253503> @TomSteger That is correct. I'll edit my question to include that info. <comment254184> Thanks for your answer. This was what I feared. I did see that there is some support for [MythTV](https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Myth_on_Mac_OS_X) on Mac, but it seems to be only for the SiliconDust products. I was really hoping to accomplish something with existing hardware.
