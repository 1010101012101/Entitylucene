How to add user to a group on command line? <body> With Linux/Unix, I can use codeuseradd -G developers vivek/code to add vivek to the developer group. How can I do the same thing with Mac OS X?  Then, how do I check if vivek is in developers group?  <answer13135> Two ways: From the terminal     Everything here should be done on the   command line    First start dscl like this:      $ dscl localhost      Then cd to the Groups node:      cd /Local/Default/Groups      You can see all the groups using ls.   Once you have found the group you are   interested in, you can view all its   properties with cat groupname. When   you are ready to add a user (username)   to the group (groupname), use the   following command:      append groupname GroupMembership   username      If you want to remove a member from a   group, use the following command (be   careful!):      delete groupname GroupMembership   username      When you are finished with your   changes, exit dscl by typing exit.   And the apple official way:     Choose Apple menu  System   Preferences, and then click Accounts.   Open Accounts preferences Step 2      If the preferences pane is locked,   click the lock icon and enter an   administrator name and password. Step   3      Click the Add (+) button, located   below the list of accounts, to create   a new account. Step 4      Select a Group from the New Account   pop-up menu. Step 5      Enter a name for the group, and then   click Create Group. Step 6      Select the checkboxes by the accounts   to be members in the group.   <answer13141> To add a user to a group:  precodedseditgroup -o edit -a vivek -t user developers /code/pre  (Note: you can also do this with codedscl/code as in @hobs' answer, but you really should both add the user's short name to the GroupMembership list, and also add the user's GeneratedUID to the GroupMembers list.  codedseditgroup/code does both with a single operation.)  To check membership:  precodedseditgroup -o checkmember -m vivek developers /code/pre  Or:  precodedsmemberutil checkmembership -U vivek -G developers /code/pre  To remove a user from a group:  precodedseditgroup -o edit -d vivek -t user developers /code/pre  (Again, you can do this with codedscl/code, but need to remove the user from both GroupMembership and GroupMembers.  codedseditgroup/code does both.)  <answer13144> I've used this one-liner:  precodesudo dscl localhost -append /Local/Default/Groups/thegroupname GroupMembership theusername /code/pre  <comment13838> possible duplicate of [Can user accounts be managed via the command line?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4814/can-user-accounts-be-managed-via-the-command-line) <comment214159> Confirmed. dscl only adds without checking user is in group already. it just adds. & it may create duplicate membership for the same user on group. <comment314900> Ok this is frustrating. When I try to use the first command it says "Username and password must be provided".  When I use "-u michael" the man page says it should prompt me for a password, but it instead prints the previous message again! <comment315006> @Michael if you specify an admin user with `-u`, it should prompt for the password. What version of OS X are you using? Also, try with `sudo` (i.e. `sudo dseditgroup -o ...`) and that should work.
