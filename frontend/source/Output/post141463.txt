unallocated space on disk0 under Mavericks <body> I have the same kind of issue than here :  Create new partition in unallocated space with diskutil  but on disk0 ! I don't know what to do anymore :(  So i can't modify anything with gpt. I had Ubuntu installed on a partition, deleted it with Disk Utility which got stuck during the process, had to force quit. Reboot the mac, and that's when it became weird :   Recovery HD was no more hidden and mounted as a standard partition on my Desktop, 20GB of the former Ubuntu partition vanished !  I tried the functions activated in the Debug Mode of Disk Utility, resetting PRAM, BootCamp tells me "the startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition", and nothing different when booting on Recovery HD to use Disk Utility.  precodeMacbook-Pro-de-Ced:~ Ced$ diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                  Apple_HFS Mac                     478.2 GB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s2 Macbook-Pro-de-Ced:~ Ced$ sudo gpt -r show disk0 Password:       start       size  index  contents           0          1         PMBR           1          1         Pri GPT header           2         32         Pri GPT table          34     409606               409640  934013608      1  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   934423248    1269536      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   935692784   41080351            976773135         32         Sec GPT table   976773167          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  Error while trying to repair disk :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IiKBY.png" alt="Error repairing"  Screens from Disk Utility :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTNh8.png" alt="Disk Utility"  I don't even have the grey zone for the unallocated space like on this post : How can I resize a partition with Disk Utility?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hw5W0.png" alt="Disk Utility partitions"  <answer142245> Wasn't exactly feeling like modifying the GPT table via the terminal with all my data on the disk, so I just completely erase the disk after backing up my data and reinstall OS X booting on a USB stick with Mavericks on it :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQ8Jw.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jh3uF.png" alt="enter image description here"  Everything is back to normal :)  <comment167408> Apparently, even my EFI partition is all messed up... http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57597/how-to-fix-broken-efi-partition
