Why are cursor keys in Excel moving the viewport rather than the active cell? <body> Excel for Mac (2011) should move the currently active cell when I use the cursor keys. Currently, it is moving the viewport in the document. Is there a way to switch this back to the default setting? I cannot find anything in Excel's preferences.  <answer34858> This sounds like Scroll Lock is somehow activated on your copy of Excel. IF you have a large keyboard with an kbdF14/kbd key, kbdShift/kbdkbdF14/kbd can turn on and off Scroll Lock. If you don't have such a keyboard, or access to such a keyboard, it gets more complicated.  Microsoft support posted this article about the various methods of deactivating Scroll Lock. They either involve connecting a keyboard with a kbdF14/kbd key or removing your Excel preferences file.  <answer219207> If you don't have an F14 key, you can use the on-screen keyboard. In Windows click the Windows key and type "osk" and then press enter. Works like a charm.  <comment39755> Shift + F14 solved it. Thanks! <comment265271> My original question was about Excel for Mac. Funnily enough, OS X doesn't have a Windows key.
