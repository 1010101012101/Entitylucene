How to disable smart quotes <body> [OS X 10.9.3 (Mavericks)] I've disabled smart quotes in the keyboard settings, but whenever I type code'/code or code"/code in Messages (old name: iChat), they get converted to code‘/code and code“/code. How do I disable this default conversion?  <answer136416> You will find this option in the Keyboard Preferences pane:  ul liOpen System Preferences./li liClick on the Keyboard icon./li liSelect the codeText/code tab./li liUncheck the codeUse smart quotes and dashes/code checkbox./li /ul  Note that this is almost a homework question. This is a keyboard/text related setting so it's fairly logical to find it under the Keyboard Preferences.  <answer136420> In addition to System Preferences, this feature can be turned on and off in each app via Edit  Substitutions.  Make sure you check that setting as well.  <answer136459>   This disables smart quotes in all applications that currently have preferences files:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codefor d in $(defaults domains|tr -d ,);do   osascript -e "app id \"$d\""&amp;&gt;/dev/null||continue   defaults write $d SmartQuotes -bool false   # defaults write $d SmartDashes -bool false   # defaults write $d SmartLinks -bool false   # defaults write $d SmartCopyPaste -bool false   # defaults write $d TextReplacement -bool false   # defaults write $d CheckSpellingWhileTyping -bool false done /code/pre  Uncomment the commented out lines to also disable other substitutions or spell checking.  <answer212964> In El Capitan (i.e. 10.11.1) I solved it by changing Smart Quote settings:  ol liOpen Keyboard in System Preferences/li liGo to Text tab/li liChange values for "for Double Quotes" and "for Single Quotes" from drop-down selection to use the simples quotes "" rather then ““/li /ol  Thats it. No need to disable or do any other work around. Hope this helps, as I had this problem with Message app when posting code.  <comment161845> In my question I noted that I've tried this and it didn't work. What I had to do was go under Edit - Substitutions and disable it there through the app itself. <comment161852> `In addition to System Preferences` I have no idea what this controls, TextEdit? :P <comment161906> Sorry, I can't understand your question. <comment161909> Don't worry, it was rhetoricle. Anyway, you *cannot* disable it on messages using system preferences. <comment197038> Right, but you CAN using the Substitutions menu, and it worked for me. Fantastic! It's suboptimal that I will have to toggle that for whenever I am texting my one friend with a dumb phone, but at least I can! <comment211065> "all applications that currently have preferences files" - meaning only those where one already made substitution changes? <comment257542> Thanks, but this question has been long solved (1 year 4 months). However, this seems like a good alt for el capitan users <comment281273> i'm guessing this is a bash script?  would be helpful if you mention how and where this code should be executed.  it's potentially very useful but less so without context
