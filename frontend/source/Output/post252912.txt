iOS 10 - my music library <body> Just upgraded to iOS 10 on my iPhone. Now my saved voice recording (changed to music in "get info") is not in my music list. Does anyone know how to get a voice memo into my music list on my phone. It shows on iTunes under my device but not in my phone. I synced, I tried everything I could. Tried to add it to iCloud music library but its not illegible. Please help  <comment314702> In iOS 9, I thought Voice Memos were not in Music either, that they were in the Voice Memos app.
