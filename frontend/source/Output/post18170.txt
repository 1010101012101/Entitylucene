Is there a clipboard manager/app with a searchable history/pasteboard? <body> So far I only know of Clyppan and Alfred but clyppan is only available as a paid app from the App Store and Alfred only offers its clipboard feature with a pay-for upgrade  <answer36118> How about Clip Menu? This seems to cover all your requirements and is free.  <comment19828> To clarify: you're not just looking for a clipboard app, you're looking for a *free* alternative to either of those mentioned in your question?
