How to import Notes in iBooks Author without cropping dialogs <body> I use strongNotes/strong and strongiBooks Author/strong on strongMacBook/strong.  I would like to import strongNotes/strong dialog block into strongiBooks Author/strong document.  However, strongiBooks Author/strong can't recognise dialogs and all beautiful long dashes in dialogs are cropped to small ugly dashes like dotes.  I use strongList with dashes style/strong in strongNotes/strong for dialogs.  Maybe there is an option to import strongNotes/strong to strongiBooks Author/strong correctly without cropping dashes and with normal dialog formatting directly from notes?  Thanks!
