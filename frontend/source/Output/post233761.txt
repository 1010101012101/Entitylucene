How do I encrypt emails using Apple Mail? <body> Gnu PGP was integrated into Mail using this project, but it appears to be dead (only supports old versions of OSX) http://www.sente.ch/software/GPGMail/English.lproj/GPGMail.html  Is there any other way to do it? Or do I have to use Enigmail for Thunderbird?  <answer233763> It appears this is what I was looking for: https://gpgtools.org/
