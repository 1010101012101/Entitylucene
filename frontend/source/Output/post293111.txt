Want to salvage the SSD out of a 2014 MacMini, but what is connector called on the end of the 2014 MacMini SSD card called? <body> Want to salvage the SSD out of a bad 2014 MacMini. When I pulled it out, I had no idea what kind of connector it uses. My friend suggested it was m.2, but I can't find one that looks like it. Anyone know what it is called off the top of their head? I'd like to get an adapter and put it in a different computer as an upgrade.  <comment369821> To the best of my knowledge (but without enough research to be an answer), the 2014 Mac Mini SSD seems to have a proprietary interface different from any other Apple SSD (and any commonly available SSD). OWC (www.macsales.com, a well respected, if overpriced, provider of numerous Mac upgrade kits) does not yet have a product for this SSD (product coming soon, according to their site). I do not know of any currently available cables or enclosures for this SSD, but I didn't do a thorough search, so it could exist.
