Xcode 7 update completes but Xcode 6.4 remains <body> I updated Xcode but it doesn't appear to have actually updated. This is seen in my update history after reboot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ST7ss.png" alt="enter image description here"  I click that and I get a link to Open the application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1kzp.png" alt="enter image description here"  I click that and I open a version that reports it is 6.4  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/23uMP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is anyone else having this problem, or does anyone know what I'm not doing correctly to apply the update?  <answer206018> Xcode installed correctly after moving it out of the Applications folder and into the Trash. I reinstalled from the App store and now the correct version number is showing.  <comment248808> I got the same problem, is it possible to fix it without reinstall ? <comment248870> @Chlebta not that I've discovered and not that anyone else has revealed. Once I fixed mine I stopped bothering with it
