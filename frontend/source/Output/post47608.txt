Lion : Assigning a fullscreen app to a space <body> With SnowLeopard, I was using spaces, with two spaces. On the second space, I was running a fullscreen application.  I created a shortcut to switch from my first space to the second space : Cmd+1 goes to space 1, Cmd+2 goes to space 2 (displaying my fullscreen app).  I recently upgraded to Lion and cannot reconfigure it to have the same behavior I had with Snow Leopard :  When running my app fullscreen, a new space (sub-space ?) dedicated to this app is created. Now, when pressing Cmd+2, it displays space 2, but it is empty, as my fullscreen app is somewhere else.  How can I make sure my fullscreen app sticks to a space, so that using Cmd+1 and Cmd+2, I can quickly switch between my normal desktop (space 1) and my fullscreen app (space 2) ?  <answer47609> Preferences  Keyboard . THere you can change the shortcuts. If what you want is possible you should be able to do it from there.   <answer47610> In Lion, the only options you have to manage the order of spaces are...  ul listrongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Mission Control &#x2192; Automatically rearrange spaces based on most recent use/strong/li liManually drag spaces in strongMission Control/strong/li /ul  The shortcuts to switch between spaces and desktops are set in...  ul listrongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Keyboard &#x2192; Mission Control/strong/li /ul  But, you can only set direct shortcuts to strongDesktops/strong - not any space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GsvcA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment54540> Also note that more shortcuts come up as you create more desktops. I just realised now. ^^ <comment54541> @latusaki Yes. That can be a bit confusing when you have only one desktop... :) <comment54543> The most confusing thing with mission control is that you can't move your 'main' desktop. Wonder what the engineers at apple were thinking... <comment54550> I'm still confused. Let's say I'm working with only one desktop. When running an app in fullscreen, Lion put it in a specific screen : is it possible to directly access this specific screen by a shortcut ? <comment54551> @Jérôme  You can click the application icon in the dock or use the applications switcher via CMD-TAB.
