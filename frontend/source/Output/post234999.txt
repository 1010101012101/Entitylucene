iPhone has stopped updating apps automatically <body> I have to open the App Store and tap emUpdate/em to keep all of the apps up to date. There is always a big list of apps waiting to be updated, which takes quite a while to complete. This issue seems to have started around the release of iOS 9.  ul liThe option for emAutomatic Downloads/em is ticket under emSettings  iTunes &amp; App Stores/em;/li liConnecting to Wi-Fi has not resolved the issue;/li liThe instructions displayed on Apple’s support page has not resolved the issue;/li liemReset All Settings/em has not resolved the issue./li /ul  There seem to be countless of people with this issue if you search the Internet. Unfortunately, none of the suggested resolutions by users have helped in my case. Could emErase All Content and Settings/em really be the only way to resolve this issue?  <answer239343> As I was in the middle of relocating, I had ended up updating my payment details including my address for my Apple ID recently. Apps have started updating automatically since then.  I hope that this information might help anyone who found that none of Apple’s proposed solutions resolved the issue. A complete reset of your iPhone might not be necessary.  <comment287401> Have you tried resetting the App Store cache?  In the App Store app, tap the 'Update' button 10 times.  You'll see a flash of the screen as the cache is flushed.  Restart your iPhone and see if this helps. <comment287571> @fbara Thank you for your reply. Yes, I have tried this method. It has not changed a thing, unfortunately. <comment287572> If you've tried all other methods, as you indicated, then completely resetting your iPhone might be your only option.  If you do the complete reset and then restore from a backup, you might be putting the problem right back on your iPhone.  I would recommend doing a backup first and only doing the restore from backup if this doesn't fix the problem. <comment287577> @fbara I was hoping to be able to avoid resetting my iPhone, especially for something like this, but it seems to be the only way for now. In any case, thank you for your time.
