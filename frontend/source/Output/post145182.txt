Automatically saving message attachments to a mailbox <body> I subscribe to a rather odd mailing list, through which I receive emails to which further emails are attached (in codeeml/code format).  I want to archive those attachments into a dedicated mailbox, all within Mail.app.  strongCan this be automated?/strong  So far, I have created a rule that triggers some AppleScript that saves the attachment to disk and then opens it in Mail.app&mdash;but this both feels rather clunky and in any event I can't see how to progress from here (since the resulting Mail.app "message" doesn't appear to be accessible to AppleScript).
