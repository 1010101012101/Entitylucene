How to get Touch ID (Add Fingerprint) prompts to appear for an account (macOS Sierra) <body> I recently migrated to a new MacBook Pro. My main user account will never show the Touch ID prompts when I click Add Fingerprint. I’m asked for my password, then nothing happens.  I am able to set up a fingerprint for another user account, so I know that macOS supports it and the Touch ID sensor works.  Is there a preference to clear so I can get the prompts?  <comment330726> I guess the answer was to wait about a week — it magically showed the prompts and I could set it up after about a week.
