What is this app called on Apple's Website? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JNZQc.jpg" alt="Chart"  What app can make a chart similar to the one shown in the screenshot?  I saw this on Apple's Website with the iPad pro, so i was wondering does anybody know what this app is called, or how I can find other software to make diagrams like this?  <comment363032> I'm also curious what that type of chart is called <comment363033> I'm struggling to find it now but I don't think this was an app. Pretty sure it's a website. <comment363034> Full image available here just in case this helps anyone locate the original. http://brain-images.cdn.dixons.com/2/9/10165892/u_10165892.jpg Also, note the scroll widget half way down the image. <comment366387> The scroll widget is the Split Screen handle :-)
