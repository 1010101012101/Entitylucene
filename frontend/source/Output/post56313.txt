How can I move Dashboard widgets to the desktop in Lion? <body> In the OS X Terminal, there is a command that allows me to drag Dashboard widgets onto my desktop. In OS X Lion, the Dashboard became a Space. I am no longer able to use this command. What is a workaround to this?  The command is:  precode    defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES     killall Dock /code/pre  <answer56314> Go to System Preferences - MIssion Control, and uncheck 'Show Dashboard as a space.'  Then do exactly what you did before.  <comment64613> Hi GurpreetSingh  The Stack Overflow site is intended for questions related to software development. Because this question is more concerned with usage of OS X, you might get better responses from our Apple-specific site AskDifferent or our more general computing site Super User <comment64614> You can look through the .plist file for the Dashboard and change the value manually. If I recall correctly, the .plist files are under `~/Library/Preferences/` and contain XML markup. I'd look up the file and value for you, but my Mac died a few weeks ago, and I'm on Ubuntu now. <comment64655> I can confirm that this works, and I'm flabbergasted that I'd never thought of that.
