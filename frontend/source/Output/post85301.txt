iTunes column for file location? <body> I'm using the latest version of iTunes (11.0.2) and would like to sort my tracks by their location on my harddrives however I think there is no column for that.  Am I right?  <answer85320> Yes, there is no column for that. And most files are in the iTunes library itself - as it copies them by default.  <comment98317> I deactived that but see your point. <comment98318> I've disabled it myself too for Series and Films, but I cannot locate them via such column as you request too. Unfortunately.. <comment98843> @Hedge please don't forget to mark as accepted answer if this answer helped you. Thanks.
