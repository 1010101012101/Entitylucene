iMac has blue line on screen at startup <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oQ4Y5.jpg" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aimVb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  iMac won't turn on any farther than this.  Blue line down the middle and that's it.  Help!   <answer286473> Looks like the GPU is hosed to me. Try restarting it while holding down kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd and see if that helps. If not, try holding down kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdpower button/kbd for 10 seconds to reset the SMC. If that also doesn't work, send it to Apple for repair.
