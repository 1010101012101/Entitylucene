pkg file extracting instead of installing? <body> Recently I noticed my pkg updates are being extracted rather than installed. (for example the MS Office update wanted to extract the file)  Is there a way to ensure that pkg files are installed?  <answer185977> Most obvious cause would be that some other app has taken over the .pkg extension - maybe a file compression utility.  Find any .pkg file &amp; kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd i /kbd to Get Info.br Where it says Open with, select Installer, then Change All  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Buffq.png" alt="enter image description here"
