Unknown used space on hard drive <body> There's an unknown space that is used on my hard drive. I've already use DaisyDisk and OmniDiskSweeper but both haven't detected anything.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsVBr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer292736> If you don't have any data on the drive, then format it. The data is probably a malfunctioning HFS+ journal.  If you do, it is either a HFS+ journal, or some cached data. It could also be the .Trashes folder. If it is, try clearing the trash with the drive plugged in, or just type codesudo rm -rf "/Volumes/DriveName/.Trashes"/code.  <comment369206> What do you mean with "unknown space"? The 852.1 MB? Some disk space is allocated to the file system itself! On a virgin 64 GB HFS+ volume about 157 MB are occupied by it. <comment369207> how can i delete it? <comment369212> Please ask questions in your "question" but not in the comments...
