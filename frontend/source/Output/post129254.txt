"There are stopped jobs." when exiting bash <body> When I'm in the terminal (either iTerm or Terminal.app) and have jobs running in the background, then typing codeexit/code or codelogout/code gives me:  precodeThere are stopped jobs. /code/pre  which is fine and expected. The problem is that if I run codeexit/code or codelogout/code again (and repeatedly), I get the same thing.  precodeisbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. isbadawi@astaire:~$ exit logout There are stopped jobs. /code/pre  I've used bash on linux, and the behavior there was for the second invocation of codeexit/code or codelogout/code to go ahead and terminate the stopped jobs. Instead, I have to do this manually. Why is the behavior different, and is there a way to make it the same?  <answer129267> If you have jobs that are stopped (with CTRL-z) or happened to be in the background but are stopped waiting for input, you can see what's there with the 'jobs' command.   If you only have a job, then a 'fg' will bring it to the front for you to interact with it or kill with a 'CTRL-c'. If you have multiple jobs, you can bring individual or specific ones with 'fg '.  <comment151299> I know about job control (this is what I was referring to by "do this manually"). I am asking why bash seems to behave differently on OS X and Linux in this instance. <comment151454> I can't reproduce it in a 10.9 VM, so check your configuration files. You could also try to install a newer version of bash by for example running `brew install bash;echo /usr/local/bin/bash|sudo tee -a /etc/shells;chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash`. <comment151526> @LaurieRanta Upgrading bash (to 4.3.11 from the system 3.2.51) seems to have fixed it!
