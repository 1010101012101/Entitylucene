Why do you want to allow invalid certificates? There _are_ some good reasons for it, but it's worth checking. <comment260985> @ChrisInEdmonton This is my university website and I have to use it by the way. I'm bypassing this error for years. Now I need a "I take the risk and continue" button. <comment260989> Your university _sucks_. No, really, they need to fix that. <comment265223> At least they should give you a certificate to install to the device. So yeah, your university's IT department is lacking.
