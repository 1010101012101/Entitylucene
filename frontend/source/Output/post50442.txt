helpd uses 100% CPU after installing any application with documentation <body> I see that after installing a software that ships with documentation in OS Xâ€™s help document format, the codehelpd/code process uses 100% CPU for up to 5 minutes or so. I also see this when you first install OS X.  I assume this happens because of indexing of the new documentation that was added by the new application.  strongIs there a way to make this indexing a bit less resource intensive?/strong   Slow it down, maybe?  When it happens, my system just crawls to a halt until it is finished.   Have anyone else experience the same problem?  <comment57857> This does not seem normal, but what is an example Application that displayed the indexing slowness. What version of Mac OS X are you running? What kind of Mac are you using?
