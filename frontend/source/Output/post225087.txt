How to remove audio device from Preferences? <body> I'm trying to remove an old device from the Sound Preferences pane. The app is trashed along with whatever preference files I could find. But it remains after reboot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hPIYa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer225140> Aggregate Devices are accessed from Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup.   You can select &amp; remove it from there.   (On phone, will flesh out later)  <comment273254> Got it, thank you!
