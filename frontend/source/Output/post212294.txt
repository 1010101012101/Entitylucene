Archived Apple Messages - How to print or reactivate <body> Is there a way to print or reactivate text messages that have been archived? I can view the archived messages just fine in the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages directory.  <answer212316> Double-clicking any of those archived messages will reopen that conversation in Messages app.  If you Search in Archive for the caller name [or number if there's no name] then open the most recent archive, that ought to import the entire conversation. If in doubt, bulk-select all the relevant archive files, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  kbd O /kbd will open them all &amp; you can test the newest against the earlier ones. Empirically it does seem to work, but I've only tried it with a couple of test cases, &amp; not any of my 'major' conversations.  Caveat…br Whether the conversation will open correctly in the main Messages window depends on whether you had Prefs  "Save History when conversations are closed" checked emat the time you closed that conversation/em.br Without that checked, you can open it in a separate window, but I can find no way to re-merge it to the main window.br If it is checked, it correctly opens in the main window too.
