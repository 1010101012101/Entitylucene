MacBook Air wifi problem <body> I was using my MacBook air yesterday and my wifi turned itself off and now I can't turn it back on.  When I click on the little icon it the dropdown menu appears after a good 5-10 seconds, occasionally the colour wheel appears whilst it's processing. After it's loaded I then click on 'turn Wi-fi on', but this has no effect. It does nothing.  I then tried using the network preferences in settings. This whole pane runs incredibly slowly at first, and then all the options are fine when I click on them, except wifi, which takes a good few seconds to load again. Again, when I click 'Turn Wi-Fi on' nothing happens.  Occasionally it'll attempt to connect, but it then quickly turns itself off again.  I'm now using my iPhone connected to my Mac via USB, and this runs fine. In fact everything runs fine, in perfect working order, except the network preferences.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Oh and I'm on Sierra 10.12. This issue happened once a few days ago too, but it then just decided to fix itself. This time I've not been so lucky. It only started happening once I updated so I wondered whether that was the issue?  <comment319954> Have you tried rebooting your computer? That fixed the only time my wifi wasn't working. <comment320007> Yeah I tried that loads of times, but didn't work. Both restarting and turning it full off and waiting a bit.
