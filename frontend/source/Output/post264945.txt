Why does playback randomly stop in ITunes? <body> I have my Mac set up to play via Bluetooth and I have a playlist on ITunes. Every now and then ITunes will simply stop playing. The track is shown as still playing just not advancing. To get it to play again I have to pause it and play it again.  Other sound events continue to reach the speaker. I have logging enabled for Bluetooth but can't see anything particularly suspicious. From the log when it most recently happened. The A2DP messages are common even when playing without problems.  precode15.12.16 10:53:11,150 coreaudiod[193]: IOBluetoothAudioDeviceOutput.m:201 Adjust by 21088.000000 bytes 15.12.16 10:53:11,161 coreaudiod[193]: IOBluetoothAudioDevice.m:499 stopIO activeIO:1 relatedDevice activeIO:0 (output) 15.12.16 10:53:11,162 coreaudiod[193]: IOBluetoothAudioDeviceOutput.m:94 stopIO:0 activeIO:0 (output) 15.12.16 10:53:13,443 bluetoothaudiod[4705]: A2DP.m:951 When trying to catch up, send additional packet returned e00002e7 (intervalsMissed: 4) 15.12.16 10:53:13,443 bluetoothaudiod[4705]: A2DP.m:951 When trying to catch up, send additional packet returned e00002e7 (intervalsMissed: 3) 15.12.16 10:53:13,443 bluetoothaudiod[4705]: A2DP.m:951 When trying to catch up, send additional packet returned e00002e7 (intervalsMissed: 2) 15.12.16 10:53:13,443 bluetoothaudiod[4705]: A2DP.m:951 When trying to catch up, send additional packet returned e00002e7 (intervalsMissed: 1) 15.12.16 10:54:12,831 coreaudiod[193]: IOBluetoothAudioDevice.m:436 startIO activeIO:0 (output) sampleRate:44100.000000 format:2 mode:0 /code/pre  Playback seems most affected if I switch in and out of browsers (any combination of them) a lot. But sometimes it will stop of its own accord. I'm using Mac OS 10.11.6 but have had this problem all year.
