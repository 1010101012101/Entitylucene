How do I access special characters on Apple's Smart Keyboard? <body> I bought the new iPad Pro 10.5" and with it the Apple Smart Keyboard with the US Layout. Now I am constantly switching between writing in german, english and some french.  Therefore I would like to access special characters like in macOS or in iOS: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H2C3f.png" alt="enter image description here"     So how can I access the special character menu via the Apple Smart   Keyboard?   <answer288388> You should be able to use the standard Apple option key shortcuts, such as kbd⌥/kbd + kbde/kbd, then e produces é.  One list is here.  For the german "Umlaut", it is:  kbd⌥/kbd + kbdu/kbd (for Umlaut) and then the letter (like kbda/kbd, kbdu/kbd or kbdo/kbd)  So:  kbd⌥/kbd + kbdu/kbd and then kbda/kbd produces “ä”   <comment364182> For õ, ã, and ñ, `⌥n` then the letter creates the character.
