How can I tell Mobile Safari to stop remembering to never remember my password? <body> I've changed my mind about having Safari/iCloud Keychain never remember my password for a given website. I'd like to remove that setting and store the password, but I can't find any ability to delete/change it anywhere. I've already gone into Settings-Safari-Passwords &amp; Autofill - Saved Passwords, and the website in question emdoes not/em show up in the list with a 'never' entry to delete.  How can I make Safari forget to keep forgetting this login info?  <answer224524> Manually enter your username and password. Tap "Passwords" right above your keyboard. Tap "Save This Password." It still won't autofill when you first load the page, but now you can tap in the username field and hit "Autofill Password." There seems to be no way to actually reset the "Never for this site" setting. Sounds like a job for http://apple.com/feedback.  <comment163771> On my iphone (ios 7), sites which I have instructed Safari to never remember are listed at the bottom of the setting page that you described, and instead of the username, "not saved" is shown. <comment163775> @kent yeah... Not seeing it there. <comment163838> The only way I know how to do it is to directly modify the keychain database.
