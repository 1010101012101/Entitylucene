altering the default number of songs in upnext (itunes11, osx)? <body> Currently I only see about 12 songs in upnext, not so great when I want to create a 3 hour playlist, but I can't find a setting anywhere to increase this.  Does such a thing exist?  <answer73727> You can make a normal or intelligent playlist and play it. Do not use shuffle and you can add songs during playback.  Edit: If you emjust/em want to show more songs in upnext - it is not possible. But 12 Songs i s a plenty of view in the future....   <comment86826> Only on this site! Maybe because no one is answering my questions with a satisfactory response? i.e. One that actually answers the question I have asked not something different or only 20% of what I'm trying to do. <comment86827> What does this have to do with altering the number of songs showing in the 'upnext' window? Did you even read the question? <comment86828> I read your question - and you said you want to create a 3h playlist (this is your end goal) so creating a normal playlist and adding songs to it will work (although up next will still show only 12 songs). But you accomplished your goal to have an 3h editable playlist. <comment86848> Question title: altering the default number of songs in upnext <comment86860> I edited the answer according to *your question* ....
