Cannot delete files after restore despite correct permissions <body> After installing a fresh version of MacOS Sierra and restoring data files, the system returns a 'Permission denied' error when trying to delete files, even though I own the files and permissions are set at 0744. The 'ls -lO' command shows no hidden flags:  ls -lO ./201611/20161116file.pdf -rwxr--r--@ 1 myname  staff  - 95741 Nov 18 18:02 ./201611/20161116file.pdf  And the Finder does not show the file as locked. Thinking that perhaps this is a parent permissions issue, I used Finder to set read &amp; write permissions on all files in my directory but that did not help.  I restored data files twice, first using 'cp -R' and again using Econ Technologies ChronoSync. In both cases the permissions issue persists. I am using the same username as the one in the backup.  Thanks in advance for clues on clearing up this permissions issue.
