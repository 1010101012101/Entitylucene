Unable to post video preview for iOS app <body> I am unable to submit the video preview of my app.  Length is ok and the upload is accepted followed by the message "Your file could not be loaded.  Try again"  <answer216444> Video upload is broken in iTunes Connect right now, due to mixed content issues, enforced in Safari 9. Either use Safari 8, or try a different browser and choose to allow mixed content.
