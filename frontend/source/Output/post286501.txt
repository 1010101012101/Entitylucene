No user to login in MacOS High Sierra <body> I installed macOS High Sierra updating to APFS and everything was working correctly. After a couple of days I shut down and went off. I just came back and when I boot there are no users to login as usual, I get a Name and Password fields.  Of course my user is not working and it is not the usual login where your user is the one you see and just type your password.  So I have a Name and Password fields that I can’t fill with anything, so I can’t login to my user.  In recovery mode I ran First Aid and I get:   precodeThe volume /dev/rdisk3s1 could not be verified completely. File system check exit code is 8. Restoring the original state found as mounted. File system verify or repair failed. Operation failed... /code/pre  Anyone with the same problem? Any advice or solution for this?  <answer293201> Had the same problem and it is a simple fix.  ol lirestart your computer/li liwhen it "chimes" hold down "command" and "R" until a menu pops up./li liGo to "Utilities" at the top of the page menu bar/li liGo to "terminal"/li liIn the terminal type "reset password"/li liFollow the instructions. You may need you Apple ID. My Administrator account does not have an Apple ID, so I just reset the Administrator password without needing an Apple ID./li /ol  If you are not able to sign in with other accounts on your computer, go to your administrator account and make sure to uncheck strongEnable parental controls/strong for those accounts in under strongSystem Preferences - Users and Groups./strong Then the other accounts should work fine.  <comment361498> Yah, this is a *developer* (not public) beta and these kinds of errors (errors that trash the system or your access to it) are just going to happen. Hopefully you made a backup before installing the beta. Unless there are Apple specific developer discussion boards that you could ask about this I would just wipe and re-install. <comment361572> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is a developer beta <comment361652> I'd leave it open as a lesson in what backups are for & why not to run betas on mission-critical machines. <comment361703> Yes, it is a Developer beta. Yes, I have a backup. Yes, I will try to fix before formatting, that’s why I am asking to see if someone knows a terminal command to force my user to be used to boot. It seems not. <comment362032> To have included that information in your original question would probably have garnered more useful comments & answers, & reduced the number of close votes & downvotes.
