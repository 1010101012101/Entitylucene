Smarter Bash Tab Completion <body> As a recent switcher from Ubuntu (Well recent switch backer if that's a word) I'm finding myself in the command line a lot more than when I was a mac user before. One thing I really loved about Ubuntu was when I was compiling and running java programs for class my tab completion was really smart. When I needed to compile my class if I had a directory that looked like:  precodeExample.java Example.class Client.java Client.class /code/pre  and I needed to compile the Client.java to take into account the most recent changes I would type:  precodejavac C [TAB] /code/pre  and it would complete to   precodejavac Client.java /code/pre  ignoring the .class files because you can't run javac on a .class. Also when I wanted to run the file typing  precodejava C [TAB] /code/pre  would result in  precodejava Client /code/pre  with no period. This was a very smart way of doing the tab completion that I got so used to that now it's driving me crazy when I hit tab and it gives me the Client. without actually completing to what I need it to be.  So is there any way to make the Mac bash completion smarter so that it would have this same effect?  <answer34916> I would suggest you set your default shell to strongzsh/strong instead of bash. It comes bundled with Mac OS X and it's fully compatible with bash, but adds some nice features including much smarter tab completion.  Try it with codechsh /bin/zsh/code  There's also a great framework for managing your zsh environment called oh-my-zsh. It's a great starting point for some powerful customization.  <answer34917> *nix packages such as codebash_completion/code can be installed with 3rd party package managers. I suggest Homebrew, but Fink and MacPorts also provide the codebash_completion/code package. If it doesn't auto-handle the Java situation you describe, post back or read the man page.  <comment39812> Interesting... never would have thought to completely change the shell. Won't this lose most of my current bash configurations as far as aliases and variable exports go? <comment39813> This worked perfectly thank you sir <comment39854> @CaldwellYSR Zsh is generally more powerful than bash (though bash can do the job too in this particular instance). Zsh isn't fully compatible with bash, so you'd lose some of your customizations. Aliases and variable exports can be copied, but other things like prompt settings would need to be redone. <comment39855> Good to know. Thanks <comment315805> Not sure suggesting that the OP totally switch their setup is a reasonable suggestion.
