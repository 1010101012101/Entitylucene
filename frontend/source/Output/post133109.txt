Can repeatedly touching the screen of a Macbook Air damage it? <body> I have a 2011 MacBook Air. Are there technical/physical reasons why it might be harmful to have the screen repeatedly touched or pressed? Why or why not?  <answer134643> Touching your screen shouldn't do any permanent damage (unless you scratch the screen with a nail) any smudges can be wiped off with a microfibre cloth.  Using a shirt or tie to clean your screen however can damage it, so always use a glasses cloth or microfibre cloth to clean it.  <answer286773> I have had my macbook air for about 5 months now and I have recently noticed a couple white dots on the screen, just a couple. I think this is from touching the screen but i'm not very sure. Im very annoyed...  <comment157696> Are you asking for opinions on screen touching vs. no screen touching or are you asking if there are technical reasons screens shouldn't be touched. The former is not a good question for the site, the latter is fine. <comment157701> @IanC. The latter one. <comment159407> Macbook Air screen is quite flimsy, applying pressure on it results in some scary color waves on the LCD. Are you sure it can't cause permanent damage? <comment159417> Unless you're pushing stupidly hard, it won't damage it, best not to though. <comment361921> Welcome to Ask Different.
