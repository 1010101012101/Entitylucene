What is triangle in circle in lock screen message notification (iOS10) <body> Occasionally when I receive a new message (I believe iMessage and SMS alike) a grey circle with a black right-facing triangle will appear on the right side of the message, like a play button. When the icon appears the message does not say, "Slide to open". The new message does not necessarily include media. Tapping the circle does nothing.  I have searched this on Google and here but have found nothing.  Anyone know what this is?  <comment321854> The only time I have seen this appear is when a video file is sent. Note that it may not actually appear as a video within the Messages app - in my case, I'm seeing it when gift boxes are sent through the Sticker Pals app. Once I get into Messages, it's an interactive object that Sticker Pals handles. I'm guessing the "fallback" item for platforms that don't support Messages apps is a video of the gift box.
