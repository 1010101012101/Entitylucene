With two external displays in Mountain Lion how do I specify where the content of the Desktop is shown? <body> I have connected two external displays to a Macbook and have deselected 'Mirror Displays'. The lid of the Macbook is closed, therefore I am using just the larger screens. The contents of my desktop are currently only shown on screen 2.  However, I would like to tell the OS to not show the contents of the Desktop on screen 2, but on screen 1. How can I achieve that?  Sorry, if this is a duplicate, I couldn't find any question about the desktop contents.  <answer150600> In my experience for Mountain Lion, determining which display is the iprimary/i display is usually achieved by dragging the white Menu Bar (circled in screenshot below) onto the graphic of another display, thus setting the other display as the iprimary monitor/i.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NWfTH.png" alt="Screenshot of my iMac&#39;s display preference pane."  <comment177215> this article might help ypu http://www.macworld.com/article/2042936/hands-on-with-os-x-mavericks-multiple-display-support.html <comment177216> Thank you, that's it! I have tried to drag the entire blue box but didn't know that you could also drag the white one.
