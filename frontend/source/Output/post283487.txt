How can I show a read-only version of Google Calendar on Apple TV 4th generation? <body> I've a mentally retarded brother that I gave an Apple TV 4th generation.  He loves it because of the YouTube player on it.  I'd like to display a read-only version of a Google Calendar on it to see if we can replace his paper calendar.  That way his care-takers can better cooperate in maintaining the read-write version of his calendar so he sees the read-only version of it (now often his paper one gets out of sync).  I tried searching for apps, but haven't found a suitable one yet.  Any ideas are welcome.  <comment357451> I'm sorry, I don't understand your question. Can you explain how you would like this to work? How can his care-takers better cooperate in maintaining his calendar if it's read only? <comment357492> @Little.Eden I hope my edit explains that well enough. <comment357493> I think you have to approach this from the perspective that it's not your brother's calendar but rather the care takers' calendar they are sharing with your brother. <comment357592> @Allan my basic idea was to have a read-write calendar account that has all the events in it and an Apple TV specific account that has read-only permissions for the calendar. Now I need to find an app that allows displaying this calendar. I found one for iPad, but not one for Apple TV: https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/29/google-calendar-ipad-app/ <comment357593> I did a quick [Bing search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=calendar+app+apple+tv&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN) for "calendar app appletv" and found this [Calendar App for AppleTV App](http://calendarforappletv.com/).  It's about half way down the page.  Will that App work? <comment357594> Thanks for that! I will give it a try and let the answer know.
