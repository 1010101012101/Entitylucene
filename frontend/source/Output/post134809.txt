Cannot add wireless network in Mavericks in System Preferences <body> I accidentally deleted the wifi connection on my macbook pro (I went to System Preference  Network, i tried to delete a VPN but accidentally deleted the WIFI connection as well). Now if I add a WIFI again using the + sign, it does not gets added. The wifi sign the top bar shows a cross on it. I have restarted my system and used different logins but it id not adding the wifi again. I also also used different names but it did not work. I need this fix asap.  <answer134815> In Terminal type this command :  precodesudo ifconfig en1 up  sudo ifconfig en0 up /code/pre  <comment159655> are you sure your network is available? <comment159656> it is not about network, it is about installing the wifi adaptor I guess. Basically wifi should show up in the list of networks before it can be connected to an available network. <comment159657> have you checked this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134727/wifi-icon-not-showing-on-the-menu-bar-and-internet-not-working-wifi-or-ethernet <comment159659> That is helpful post but the problem in my case, if I add wifi using + sign, it does not get added. if I do it with any other type like thunderbolt, it does gets added. <comment159660> you turned off the wifi, check in about this mac <comment159661> In the other thread try the steps described in Buscars answer <comment159663> Thank @Buscarì›ƒ your answer on the other post was helpful but I have to carefully type the commands as I am on Windows now. Ok so I see Wifi has en1 interface. It says Network status Inactive. How will I activate it. <comment159664> I tried `sudo ifconfig en1 up` and then the same command with `down` does seem to fix the problem. brb thx <comment159665> you should be checking good answers so we do not sit here having them displayed as not done :) <comment159694> +1 Check the answer
