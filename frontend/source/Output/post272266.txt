MBP Login screen after sleep - enter key doesn't enter password <body> I have Sierra on a MBP. Recently I tried out 'Okey' an app that unlocks your Mac with your iPhone. However it was slower than me typing my password so I deleted it (on the Mac using AppCleaner). However, now, when the Mac wakes from sleep and I put in my password, followed by the enter key, nothing happens, I have to click the little arrow with trackpad or mouse to finish logging in. And when I do, it does the cube rotate animation like when you switch users.   Never did this before 'Okey' so am guessing it's changed something. I've contacted their support without reply. And it only does it after sleep - straight from boot it behaves as it always has.  Anyone know what could be causing this? - I'm happy using the terminal to change settings if I know what to type.
