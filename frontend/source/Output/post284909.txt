Unknown “Pointing Up Arrow Above a Horizontal Bar” icon <body> Mac mini (late 2012) under macOS Sierra 10.12.4.  During routine operations (at least I cannot think of anything unusual) an unknown “Pointing Up Arrow” icon (first on the left side) appeared:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCp8X.png" alt="unknown “Pointing Up Arrow” icon"  After restart this icon disappeared.  What caused this icon to appear? Should I be concerned?  Please help!  <comment359308> It's the standard symbol for CapsLock - but I don't know what may be putting it on the menu bar <comment359338> Thank you very kindly for your most appreciated help, @Tetsujin!
