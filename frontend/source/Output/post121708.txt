Getting the list of saved BSSIDS from a Mac OSX <body> I have recently started jailbreaking students' iPhones and iPods at my school. Today, after successfully jailbreaking a student's Verizon wireless iPhone 4, it was stolen. My school, however, blocks some resources that evasi0n7 uses to install the iOS 7 jailbreak. So I used this student's hotspot to connect and download the resources required to jailbreak the device. I am now attempting to recover the BSSID of the iPhone (in my wireless list of my Macbook) to input into the wireless management system to see where it was last detected to help narrow down the students who might have it. However, I can't find any way to get the BSSID, only the SSID and password from the keychain. I also connected it to a Windows 8 tablet, which I cant get any information out of, either. Also, the device was wiped, and I did not set up iCloud or Find My iPhone. Considering it is jailbroken, I could probably connect to it using a ssh session, and upload a package to make the device go off during class. If not, we could at least narrow it down. Any help would be nice.  <comment142243> Unless you explicitly installed `openssh`, it won't have SSH. Also, BSSIDs aren't used to reconnect to an access point - only the SSID and PSK are used. If BSSIDs were used, then large-scale, seamless Wi-Fi networks wouldn't work, as you'd have to put in your password for each AP in the network, regardless of its SSID. This is why Mac OS X and other operating systems don't bother to keep track of the BSSID for every AP it's ever connected to. It's just simply useless in the eyes of the OS and Wi-Fi driver. Also, the BSSID wouldn't be the same as its Wi-Fi MAC, so you're out of luck, sorry.
