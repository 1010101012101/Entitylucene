Difference between autopoweroff and standby in pmset <body> I just got a new Retina MacBook Pro 15". After getting some downloads interrupted due to the computer going to sleep (even on AC power), I started looking at the man page for the codepmset/code command. I did solve my original problem with sleeping but a few options piqued my interest. In particular, here's the description for the codeautopoweroff/code setting from the man page:     strongautopoweroff/strong - Where supported, enabled per default as an implementation of Lot 6 to the European Energy-related Products Directive. After sleeping for strongautopoweroffdelay/strong minutes, the system will write a hibernation image and go into a lower power chipset sleep. Wakeups from this state will take longer than wakeups from regular sleep. The system will not auto power off if any external devices are connected, if the system is on battery power, or if the system is bound to a network and wake for network access is enabled.   And then there's the codestandby/code mode:     strongstandby/strong causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to strongON/strong for supported hardware. The setting strongstandby/strong will be visible in strongpmset -g/strong if the feature is supported on this machine.      strongstandby/strong only works if stronghibernation/strong is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.      strongstandbydelay/strong specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hibernation image to disk and powering off memory for Standby.   Now maybe I'm just being thick, but both options seem like they do essentially the same thing. The main difference I see is that codestandby/code requires a specific codehibernatemode/code.  Concretely, the way I'd like to configure my computer is for it to do a RAM-only sleep (exactly like codehibernatemode 0/code does) when first closing the lid, so that it quickly goes to sleep, without writing the RAM contents to disk immediately. However, if I leave the computer sleeping with the lid closed for a certain number of hours (say 4 hours), I'd like it to only then write the RAM contents to disk and power off the computer, so as to save battery in case of an extended sleep. Ideally, I'd also like the second part (writing RAM to disk and power off) to happen only if the computer is running on battery power.  The reasoning here is that, for me, the common use case for sleeping is taking the computer from home to work and back, and there's no point in slowing down the sleep process and wasting SSD write cycles (as well as slowing down the wake-up process, if it does hibernate) if I'm just going to wake it up again in less than an hour; also, since the time it spends sleeping is so short, not much battery would be saved by shutting the computer down for such a short period.  How should I configure the codehibernatemode/code, codeautopoweroff/code, codeautopoweroffdelay/code, codestandby/code and codestandbydelay/code options to achieve this behavior?  <answer114030> The autopoweroff feature is also mentioned in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1757:     With the release of the OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 supplemental update 2.0, a new feature was introduced to enter safe sleep after four hours of the computer being connected to AC power. This is an effort to comply with the European Energy Standards (ErP Lot6). This will only occur if there is no wireless or Ethernet activity and no activity from external devices such as USB storage devices.       This is normal behavior for the following models:       ul   liMacBook Pro (Mid 2012 and later)/li   liMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012 and later) /li   liMacBook Air (Mid 2012 and later)/li   liiMac (Late 2012 and later)/li   liMac mini (Late 2012 and later) /li   /ul   Standby mode is documented in http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4392:     Macs that can use standby mode:      ul   liMacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2012) and later/li   liMacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) and later/li   liMacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012)/li   liMacBook Air (Mid 2010) and later/li   liSSD and Fusion drive versions of Mac mini (Late 2012) and later/li   liSSD and Fusion drive versions of iMac (Late 2012) and later/li   /ul      Mac computers manufactured in 2013 or later enter standby after three hours of "regular" sleep. Earlier computers activate after just over an hour of "regular" sleep.       To enter standby, the computer must:      ul   liBe running on battery power (if it is a Mac notebook computer)./li   liHave no USB devices attached./li   liHave no Thunderbolt devices attached./li   liHave no SD card inserted./li   liHave no external display attached./li   liA computer with a fully charged battery can remain in standby for up to thirty days without being plugged in to an AC power source. /li   /ul      The state of the computer is saved to the flash storage (SSD), then the power to the hardware subsystems turns off to increase the length of the standby. For example, RAM memory and the USB bus are powered off during the standby.   So standby mode and autopoweroff are supported by different models of Macs and they are enabled under different conditions. Standby mode was introduced in 2010 and it was initially only supported by MacBook Airs, but it is now supported by all new Macs except Mac Pros, iMacs with no SSD, and Mac minis with no SSD. autopoweroff was introduced in 2012 and it is supported by all new Macs except Mac Pros.  I don't know if the state of being in standby mode is different from the autopoweroff state. A gray screen with a progress bar is shown when a Mac wakes up from both states.  Note that Apple has used "safe sleep" to refer to both the hybrid sleep and hibernation mode that laptops use by default (like in http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11096) and to the hibernation-only state (like in the first block quote above).  Even if you set standbymode to 0 and disable standby mode and autopoweroff, you won't waste that much energy. New laptops use about 0.7-1W of energy in sleep mode and about 0.2-0.3W when off or in hibernation mode.  <answer128079> This is a good compilation and juxtaposition of the two power management modes: standby vs autopoweroff, but the conclusions made above are not entirely correct IMHO.   I have a Macbook Pro 15" mid 2012 (non-SSD), and it supports both standby and autopoweroff. The articles quoted above do not show that MacBook Pro mid 2012 supports the standby mode; however, below is the output of the "pmset -g cap" command on my MacBook Pro:   precode$ pmset -g cap Capabilities for AC Power:  displaysleep  disksleep  sleep  womp  acwake  lidwake  halfdim  sms  gpuswitch  standby  standbydelay  ttyskeepawake  hibernatemode  hibernatefile  autopoweroff  autopoweroffdelay /code/pre  I have had all kinds of power management issues since Mountain Lion; The computer would hibernate after it would go to sleep, so I started looking into the "pmset" command. At times it did seem, however, that the "autopoweroff" hibernation would be triggered by the "autopoweroffdelay" timer but the "standby" hibernation would not be triggered by the "standbydelay" timer. Power management has never worked correctly since Mountain Lion - even in Mavericks.   I have just looked in the log of the pmset command, and it seems that my MacBook Pro was woken up "Dark Wake" at 11:02 PM "due to EC.ACAttach/Maintenance" and then again at 3:32 "due to EHC1/HID Activity". The AHC1/HID device is either my Logitech bluetooth keyboard or my Magic Trackpad.   precodepmset -g stats  4/17/14, 7:06:08 PM EDT  Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:99%)                                               4/17/14, 7:06:11 PM EDT  SlowResponse           PMConnection: Response from com.apple.apsd is slow (powercaps:0x0)                    3038 ms        4/17/14, 7:06:34 PM EDT  Assertions             PID 33194(AddressBookSour) Released PreventUserIdleSystemSleep "Address Book Source Sync" 00:00:30  id:0x100000b31 [System: No Assertions]             4/17/14, 7:06:34 PM EDT  Assertions             PID 172(UserEventAgent) Released BackgroundTask "com.apple.AddressBook.ScheduledSync" 00:00:30  id:0xc00000b32 [System: No Assertions]             4/17/14, 7:06:36 PM EDT  Timedout               PMConnection: Response from CMacPowerHelper timed out (powercaps:0x0)                 27999 ms       4/17/14, 7:06:36 PM EDT  WakeRequests           Clients requested wake events: None                                                     4/18/14, 11:02:09 AM EDT                        Summary- [System: No Assertions] Using AC                                              4/18/14, 11:02:14 AM EDT DarkWake               DarkWake [CDN] due to EC.ACAttach/Maintenance: Using AC (Charge:87%)        1 secs     4/18/14, 11:02:14 AM EDT Timedout               Kernel: Response from Messages timed out (powercaps:0x9)                              30000 ms       4/18/14, 11:02:14 AM EDT SlowResponse           Kernel: Response from powerd is slow (powercaps:0x0)                                  28003 ms       4/18/14, 11:02:14 AM EDT Assertions             PID 16(powerd) Created InternalPreventSleep "com.apple.powermanagement.acwakelinger" 00:00:00  id:0xe00000b3f [System: PrevIdle SRPrevSleep kCPU]              4/18/14, 11:02:15 AM EDT Wake                   DarkWake to FullWake [CDNVA] due to HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:87%)                4/18/14, 11:02:17 AM EDT SlowResponse           PMConnection: Response from com.apple.notificationcenter.dnd is slow (powercaps:0x1f)             1536 ms        4/18/14, 11:02:47 AM EDT Assertions             PID 33219(SubmitDiagInfo) Released PreventUserIdleSystemSleep "com.apple.SubmitDiagInfo.run" 00:00:36  id:0x100000b3e [System: PrevIdle BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU]               4/18/14, 11:02:59 AM EDT Assertions             PID 16(powerd) TimedOut InternalPreventSleep "com.apple.powermanagement.acwakelinger" 00:00:44  id:0xe00000b3f [System: PrevIdle BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU]              4/18/14, 11:02:59 AM EDT Assertions             PID 16(powerd) Released InternalPreventSleep "com.apple.powermanagement.acwakelinger" 00:00:44  id:0xe00000b3f [System: PrevIdle BGTask SRPrevSleep kCPU]              4/18/14, 11:03:13 AM EDT Assertions             PID 33240(AddressBookSour) Released PreventUserIdleSystemSleep "Address Book Source Sync" 00:00:53  id:0x100000b5b [System: BGTask]            4/18/14, 11:03:13 AM EDT Assertions             PID 172(UserEventAgent) Released BackgroundTask "com.apple.AddressBook.ScheduledSync" 00:00:53  id:0xc00000b5c [System: BGTask]   4/19/14, 3:32:20 AM EDT  Wake                   Wake [CDNVA] due to EHC1/HID Activity: Using AC (Charge:99%)                7182 secs  /code/pre  The MacBook Pro never entered the "hibernate" mode because I kept the  "autopoweroffdelay" timer at its default value of 14,400 seconds (4 hours) for both Battery Power and AC Power. I manually set "standby delay" to 28,800 seconds (8 hours) for Battery Power and to 100,800 seconds (28 hours) for AC Power. The only way to know for sure which "hibernation" option kicks in - "autopoweroff" or "standby" - is to set one to a very short time interval - like maybe 1 hour after the Mac goes to "sleep". Then one can see which "hibernate" mode triggered the Mac to "hibernate".   Needless to say that it's unacceptable that Apple cannot get this working right for several years now. The features supported by the "pmset" command need to be cleaned up, and the supported options need to be available in GUI in System Preferences.    <answer161799> This hibernate/sleep thing has been driving me insane. And I agree that Apple should put more energy into fixing this pmset behavior.  I will be clear. I love hibernate mode and it used to work perfectly in older models and OSs (just running sudo pmset hibernatemode 25 was enough). Now Apple broke something and this just doesn't work since Yosemite.  I have a Retina now and now more than ever the hibernate option makes way more sense that the Sleep. I dont get why people having SSDs love Sleep over hibernate so much, I just don't understand they don't understand the the wake up time difference between hibernate and sleep is 1 seconds but they save tons of battery,m someone explain me what they see as the big advantage cause I don't get it. Anyways, (if you love hibernate as much as I do, continue reading) I wanted hibernate to work. It took me weeks to make it work and I will share what I did with you all.  hr  You HAVE TO reset the SMC and then the NVRAM / PRAM first:  Reset the SMC (http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964):  ol liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer.  /li /ol  emNote:/em The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC.

Set the Macbook to sleep and when you wake it up you will see a progress bar before the computer is done. That means, the macbook was hibernating!

I guess `standby` mode is what I really need then. <comment255985> I have a question: on my Macbook pro 2015 (12,1) pmset -g shows: autopoweroffdelay 14400 I never changed it, so it is factory setting. But "man pset" shows: autopoweroffdelay - delay before entering autopoweroff mode. (Value = integer, in minutes) So with factory setting set to 14400, my mac will not go into safesleep before... 10 days ! Curious, isn't it ? <comment274431> When talking about energy waste, please multiply your numbers by the number of laptops on the planet.  Also, perhaps I'm missing something but why would anything use power "when off"? <comment293068> This worked for me using late 2008 macbook pro running El Capt.
