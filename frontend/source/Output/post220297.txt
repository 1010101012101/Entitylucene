Why is VLC verified every time I open a file that is supposed to open with it? <body> I have downloaded VLC for Mac, and I installed it. Now every time I open a video that is supposed to be opened by VLC, it starts verifying again, like it is the first time and it will install it. I also don't see a shortcut in the Applications folder. What is the way around this?  <answer220298> If your Applications folder doesn't contain VLC.app, you probably didn't install it properly. The verifying process (trying to start VLC) indicates that a dmg containing the app has to be opened.  Since VLC is a self-containing app you don't have to initiate an installation. Instead open the downloaded VLC.dmg, drag and drop the VLC.app inside the mounted dmg to the folder /Applications. Then unmount the dmg and start VLC.
