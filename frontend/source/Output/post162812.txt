Reset or Uninstall Yosemite Server <body> I installed Yosemite Server and I had previously configured the Apache for web development. Now, It seems that the configuration and everything is messed up.  How can I reset my web server configuration to factory settings, like after installing a fresh Yosemite?  Does an uninstall of Yosemite Server affects my current web server configuration?  <answer162813> You can reset just the Websites service in OS X Server with the following command:  precodesudo serveradmin command web:command=restoreFactorySettings /code/pre  Make sure the Websites and Wiki services are off when you run this command.  Uninstalling OS X Server will, by default, retain all configuration files so that reinstallation keeps all data, however you can delete the Server folder to reset all the data.  <comment191051> Thanks for the good explanation. This helped me a lot.
