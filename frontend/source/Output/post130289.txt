Macbook Pro Retina 13" Touchpad not responsive <body> I've got a Macbook Pro Retina 13" with Mavericks installed and the Touchpad is not responsive and sometimes I have to click up to ten times before it will recognize my click. I removed the strongtap-to-click/strong and I really have to press the touchpad.  I've used the exact same setup on my previous Macbook Pro (non retina) without issues.  Is there something I can reset myself before contacting Apple? I've bought this Macbook  just a bit over 3 months ago - so the Apple Care you get by default is no longer valid.  As my search online I've found a fix, but this fix is not written for my software it claims on installation: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1704?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  <answer130297> I'm never really into answering my own posts but after calling AppleCare (even though I had no longer valid AppleCare I still tried it) it turns out to be a hardware issue. My macbook is going away for repair on next monday and it will take up to 5 working-days before I get my Macbook back strongemwith functioning trackpad!/em/strong  The steps we've taken during the phone call:  ol liShut down the Macbook, connect the charger and perform a SMC-reset. (The led indicator on the magsafe will turn from orange to green and back to orange if successful)/li liBoot with kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd - this step was taken to check if the touchpad works in Recovery Mode, ruling out Mavericks being the issue./li /ol
