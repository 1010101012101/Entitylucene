How to set Finder to show all files in search including hidden and Library files? <body> When I unistall an application I want to check for all remaining files on computer. Searching them with Finder doesn't show any protected file, for instance from Library, and also hidden files are never included in search. Can this be controlled or changed?  <answer84620> The simplest way is using TinkerTool  <answer84666> You can add the System files and File visibility attributes to the filter bar:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Salfp.png" alt=""  Files that start with a period are still excluded though.  This makes Finder show hidden files:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true /code/pre  mdfind includes system files by default, but it doesn't include hidden files unless you specify kMDItemFSInvisible=1.  precodemdfind 'kMDItemFSName=.bash_profile&amp;&amp;(kMDItemFSInvisible=1||kMDItemFSInvisible=0)' /code/pre  <answer127948> Alternatively use the free ShowAllFiles app which adds an icon to the bar at the top of the screen. Clicking the icon will toggle hidden files and optionally relaunch Finder to auto refresh.   showallfiles.com  Disclosure: I made this app.  <comment97514> thanks for sharing, i'll also try the tool. <comment98023> Any idea how to include applications' package contents? <comment275546> Why the `.bash_profile`?
