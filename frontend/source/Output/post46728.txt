How to specify "play next" in iTunes? <body> When iTunes is playing songs from a Playlist, sometimes I just want to play a song from later in the playlist.  Is there a way to load songs into a queue, or to tell iTunes to play another song next?  I'm using iTunes 10.6.0.40 on Windows 7.    <answer46730> I believe you need to use the iTunes DJ playlist feature to do something like this. It's located on the top of the Playlists list.  This let's you:     Change the list of upcoming songs at any time by adding, removing, or reordering them.   Once you have it enabled, you can right-click a song and choose strongPlay Next in iTunes DJ/strong.  <answer46731> You could use iTunes DJ. Select the playlist that you want from the list in the left-hand corner.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5QUhX.png" alt="iTunes DJ"br Then, you can right click on a song, and select "Play next in iTunes DJ"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHOjW.png" alt="Play next in iTunes DJ"
