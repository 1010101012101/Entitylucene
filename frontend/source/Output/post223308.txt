Make lower case for pattern in TextEdit <body> If I select text using a pattern in TextEdit how do I transform that selected text?  I can't get anything in the Transform menu to work when text is selected like this.  I am using a pattern to find and highlight text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L6cck.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer223319> You can't, as the 'selected text' is your search parameter, not your document contents.   You'd need to use Replace &amp; set your desired capitalisation change in there - for which you could copy paste into replace &amp; use the very function you're trying to use in the main text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/da1jI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment270719> I'm assuming that by "a pattern", you mean when you search for some text, and it highlights the matches? <comment270723> Yes.  For my example I was using an actual pattern with "Any Word Characters" but same issue as with just using text. <comment270728> Can you, pls, show screenshot? I tried to make what you wrote here and still have 'Make lower case' available in menu. What's not working for you? <comment270740> I'm using a pattern to find & replace.  http://mattgemmell.com/images/find_patterns_lion/find_patterns_menu.jpg <comment270741> I added a screenshot.  I'm creating a pattern to highlight matches. <comment270742> Then you can't. The above still applies, but the results are far more unpredictable.
