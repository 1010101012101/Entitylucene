iTunes won't sync music library back to iPhone 6 or 5 <body> This is my Bizarro Problem.  For a while, I have noticed that my iPhone has lost some of the music files when I sync to the Mac. First it was CDs that I had ripped, and therefore was not associated with an apple id, then it was some music I had downloaded through iTunes.   This week, with iOS8, I decided to upgrade my 5, and I got a 6. I am not using iTunes Match.   To prepare:  ol liBack up to iCloud/li liEncrypted back up to iTunes on the Mac  2-b - download and installed iTunes 11.4 - rebooted./li liDownloaded and installed iOS8 on my 5 successfully/li liPicked up 6 today, set up by restoring from my encrypted back up on iTunes/li liAll Aps, photos, settings, passwords came over fantastically, Music did not. only 300 of 3800 songs synced. /li liWent to Music, made sure Sync Music was clicked, and Sync Selected Songs, the blue Audio bar expanded, and I started the sync. It quickly went through the 4 steps to begin copying songs - and then abruptly stopped. this took less than a minute./li liTried the above with sync all music.  I have 50 gig of memory free, so I have room for the library. /li liSwitched cord I was using between phone and computer/li liRebuilt iTunes library - which got me to 1400 songs, rather than 300, but still not what I want. /li /ol  And that is where we are at.   Ideas?  thoughts?  <answer146232> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfExP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"Many users have reported this problem with syncing music on iOS 8. The following steps can be taken to Sync the music back onto your iPhone.  • Uncheck “sync music” in iTunes  • Delete Music (General  Usage  Manage Storage)  • Re-check “sync music”  • Sync  I did this and also had to make sure, under the Summary tab in iTunes that "Sync only checked songs &amp; videos" AND "Manually manage music &amp; videos" were checked. ONLY then did it sync successfully.   <comment174876> I found that if you go to `General  Usage  Manage Storage` on the phone, and then edit and delete the songs/music that was missing; when you auto sync with iTunes, it will retrieve the missing music.  I also have this problem and find it extremely annoying and wish Apple had better (more open) phone management.  Deleting everything is not a great option when you have thousands of songs — it's bad on hardware and takes forever to complete, which a user/consumer should not have to afford.
