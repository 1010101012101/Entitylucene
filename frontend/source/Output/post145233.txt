How to know which apps to shutdown when there is overheating? <body> I once unfortunately closed a program that I found in the Activity Monitor to be using a lot of resources. A bit of Context: that day my macbook pro was suddenly heating up like crazy and the usually silent fan started blaring up! So I guessed that it was the root of all the trouble and force-quoted it, only to be subject to a screen of death notification!  So, in order to avoid this, I ask you to help me to be a better judge of the applications for situations as these!  <answer145235> The recent Firefox release (32) has a tendency to run in to conflict resulting in very high CPU consumption. That leads to high speed fans cooling.  The FF people have released a fix to it (32.01), but the results is jet to be seen.  <comment171142> Do you have the Firefox browser installed? <comment171145> What did you shut down? You went into Activity Monigtor & just randomly shut down processes? If you have no idea how Unix systems work you are asking for trouble. You should not do that. Instead just power down the whole Macbook & take a break. <comment171146> I do have Firefox installed. And i shutdown one of the processes that were in the top. The processes are listed according to the amount of resources they use up. <comment171148> The latest version of Firefox has some problems leading to high cpu usage (fans spinning) <comment171149> Thanks, that just explains a lot! Firefox was indeed in my foreground that day! <comment171150> you are welcome <comment171153> Ok, so can I be decently sure that all software I have that are from other developers (not from apple) may be the cause for the issues related to heating? I'm trying to eliminate a set of possibilities here to focus on apps that may be the potential causers for the problem.
