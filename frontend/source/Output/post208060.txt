How to create a password protected ad-hoc network on Yosemite when not connected to the internet <body> This is a more precise reframing of questions No secure ad-hoc network with Yosemite? (my use case) and How to create a password protected ad-hoc network on Yosemite (not applicable here).  Background info: With Yosemite (Mac OS 10.10) Apple removed the option to setup a empassword protected/em ad-hoc network. However, emInternet Sharing/em allows to setup a secure network to share an internet connection from another network interface.  Now, the problem is that the emInternet Sharing/em network does not work for my use case, since it fails to start up when there is no internet connection to share. Peeking in the console reveals this message:  precode  configd[50]: no interface for external service id /code/pre  This means, there seems to be no longer a possibility to quickly but securely connect two devices without bringing an external router, unless someone knows a trick or pointers how to configure the Software Base Station, or dive deep down into network config, maybe using ifconfig, natd, ipfw like here: https://blog.netnerds.net/2012/07/os-x-how-to-setup-nat-on-lion-and-mountain-lion/   <comment250980> What's the purpose of the ad-hoc network? Does an ssh-tunnel meet your requirements? <comment251248> The network is to connect an iPad to a Mac to control music software for live performances. It should be password protected to prevent the audience from trying to connect (and eat the bandwidth), but no sensitive data is transmitted over it. <comment251252> What kind of Mac do you have exactly? <comment251549> MacBookPro retina 13" early 2015 MacOS 10.10.5, trying to connect an iPad 1 early 2010 iOS 5.1 <comment255536> One hunch I'm having is that it might be possible to start up some software on the Mac that *fakes the internet*, i.e. that simulates some responses such as DHCP, then connect to this via software using loopback (localhost), and then share this fake internet connection to Wifi, thus allowing an infrastructure network with password to be created. Utopical?
