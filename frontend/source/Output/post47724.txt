PATH not being changed for root user <body> I have added .bash_profile, .bashrc, .profile exeuctables in the /var/root dir.  However, unlike the normal users which execute their .bash_profile(s) and change the path.  There is no difference in the profiles but the root user one does not work.  I am unclear about how to get this workinkg.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.   <answer47725> Try adding the path in em~/.profile/em  <answer47726> For system wide changes (including root user) you have to edit code/etc/profile/code or code/etc/bashrc/code.  <answer47779> To get to root I find it helpful to use:  precodesudo su - /code/pre  This is a login shell, it runs root's dotfiles and sets up whatever environment you want root to have.  However, this will leave code$LOGNAME/code as your logged in user.  To get a full login shell, as if you logged into the console as root:  login -fp root  Also, if you, like me, use root a lot, you can set that login command in your terminal.  In iTerm I have a root visor and window where I login as root.  Why?   ul liusing sudo litters my homedir with root owned files. I trip over them,/li licodesudo bash/code or codesudo zsh/code make me root but with my mortal environment.  This is not what I want. I want separation. /li liConvenience. There are lots of things that root sees that admin users do not. /li /ul  Chiggsy works in his homedir.   Root works on the system.   precodeman login /code/pre  <answer89630> If you're using Mac OS X 10.7 or 10.8 you can create a code/etc/launchd.conf/code file and add your variables as is :  precodesetenv PATH /bin:/usr/bin:/Applications/Myapp.app/Contents/bin /code/pre  and reboot  <comment54667> Generally, one doesn't use the root user in Mac OS X; the "Mac way" is to use sudo.
