Can MS Outlook work with iCloud? Can I iCloud-sync my iPad 2, iPhone 4S and Outlook 2010? <body> I haven't been successful getting iCloud to work with Outlook 2010 on my Windows 7 PC. My iPad 2 and iPhone 4S are iCloud synced. Is it hopeless to get all 3 together: iPhone, iPad and Outlook 2010? I get into iCloud on the PC, start the sync with Contacts and it fails.  Should I just give up on PC/iCloud and just use iCloud for the 4S and iPad?  <answer50827> You should be able to set this up by using these instructions. You need to make sure you have the iCloud Control Panel for Windows. I've set this up on numerous occasions and it's worked well.   <answer51784> Matt's right, you need the Control Panel for Windows, but it's also worth adding CodeTwo Sync for iCloud to it. The Control Panel adds an additional account to Outlook and CodeTwo puts it all together by syncing the default profile with iCloud in real time.  <comment138452> Did you try these solutions and did they work out for you? I need to do something similar?
