iOS 4.2 UI Controls visual glitch in Landscape <body> The UI on my iPod touch 2 (iOS 4.2.1) is glitchy, where at the edges is a white split.  System Info:  ul liiPod touch 2g/li liJailbroken/li liSome LaunchDaemons Deleted./li /ul  <comment47093> I wouldn't expect deleting those launchdaemons helped much. <comment47472> Could you provide a bit more information? Are you trying to get rid of the glitch? What exactly happens when it glitches? Could you post a screenshot? What are the steps required to reproduce your problem? What launch daemons did you disable?
