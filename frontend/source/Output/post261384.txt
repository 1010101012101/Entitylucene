MacBook Pro Early 2015 13" temperature <body> Last week I bought new MacBook Pro 13", early 2015, core i5, 8GB RAM, and now I am a little bit worried about it's temperature. It's my first MacBook, so I don't really know what temperatures should I expect.  I am getting 50째C - 60째C (CPU) when browsing the web, while having multiple tabs opened (Google Chrome) and Dropbox running in the background.  I don't know if these are okay, the bottom side of MacBook seems a little warm on touch.  Maybe I am a little bit overcautious, but I just want to make sure.  <answer261385> This is absolutely 100% perfectly fine!  My MBP temp is regularly between 66 and 81 degrees, and my fans are regularly at 6200 RPM when my CPU usage is high.   Also, this resource (which can be filtered) clearly shows that 50째C - 60째C is nothing to worry about.
