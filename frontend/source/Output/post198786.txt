Use AirDrop between iPhone and older Macs (need "Don't see who you're looking for?" button on Mac) <body> I have a new Mac Mini, an old MacBook (which supports AirDrop but has on old Bluetooth module) and an iPhone.  When I need to AirDrop between my macs, in Mac Mini's AirDrop panel appear a button "Don't see who you're looking for?" which allow to work even with Macs with old Bluetooth module and Macs see each other.  Now I need to AirDrop between my MacBook and iPhone but, on my iPhone I can't find the "Don't see who you're looking for?" button so AirDrop doesn't work.  I tried this but it doesn't work...  Is there a way to solve?  <answer198788> From Apple Support:     What you need To share content with AirDrop, both people need one of   these devices using iOS 7 or later, or a Mac with OS X Yosemite:      ul   liiPhone 5 or later/li   liiPad (4th generation) or later/li   liiPad mini/li   liiPod touch (5th generation or later)/li   /ul      System Requirements      To see if your Mac works with AirDrop, make sure youâ€™re in the Finder   by clicking the desktop (the background area of your screen), or by   clicking the Finder icon in the Dock. Then, check to see if AirDrop is   listed as an option in the Go menu. If you don't see AirDrop listed,   your Mac doesn't support this feature.      In order to transfer files between a Mac and and an iPhone, iPad or   iPod touch      ul   liYour iOS device needs to include a lightning connector /li   liYour iOS device needs iOS 7 or later installed/li   listrongYour Mac needs to be a 2012 or later model with OS X Yosemite installed/strong/li   liYour Mac and iOS device both need bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on.

MacBook Pro (Late 2008 or newer)** MacBook Air (Late 2010 or newer)   MacBook (Late 2008 or newer)** iMac (Early 2009 or newer) Mac Mini   (Mid 2010 or newer) Mac Pro (Early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card, or   Mid 2010)   **The MacBook Pro (17-Inch Late 2008) and the white MacBook (Late 2008) do not support AirDrop.      For help identifying your Mac, choose About This Mac from the Apple   menu. You can refer to the Apple Support website to find out if your   iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch includes a lightning connector.   So, sadly, there is no known hack to make it work with iOS devices and older Mac's.  Would be a great feature though!  <answer198790> There are two versions of AirDrop. The Mac-to-Mac AirDrop that was introduced in Lion works with old Bluetooth modules. The Mac-to-iDevice AirDrop that was introduced in Yosemite only works with newer modules (2012 or later). If you really want to get Mac-to-iDevice AirDrop, you'll need to either upgrade your AirPort card or get a dongle. Continuity Activation Tool is a great app for enabling that feature, and they made a handy chart telling you what hardware you need to put on your computer to make it work with Mac-to-iDevice AirDrop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JVkt9.jpg" alt="Compatibility chart"  <comment237994> Great chart!  + from me
