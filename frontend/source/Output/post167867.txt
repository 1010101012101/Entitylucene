Prevent changing default app for some file extensions <body> Is there anyway to prevent that whatever app change the default app for some kind of files?  As an example, my default app for movies (codemp4/code, codemkv/code, codeavi/code, ...) is VLC, and I don't want this to be changed for whatever reasons.  <answer168232> I'm using OS X 10.10.1.  The file that stores the "Open With" data seems to be code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.LaunchServices.secure.plist/code  Assuming you've setup all of your apps' "Open With" settings, you can ensure that they're not permanently overwritten by removing write permissions from the above file:  codechmod 444 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.LaunchServices.secure.plist/code  It kind of works.  I tested this using a .docx file. I set my "Open With" preference to Pages.app and then removed the write permission of the LaunchServices plist file. I found that despite changing the permissions of the preference file, I was still able to change the .docx's "Open With" preference to Microsoft Word. However, after restarting the machine the setting was reverted to the one in the "com.apple.LaunchServices.secure.plist" file as it couldn't write the new data to the file.  I assume OS X stores in memory the "Open With" information if it can't write to the LaunchServices file, which is lost after a restart.  Not a great solution and I hope there's a better one, but it's a start.  You can revert the change by running this command:  codechmod 644 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.LaunchServices.secure.plist/code  <answer168257> The easiest way to change the default application back is for each file type (codemp4/code, etc…); select the file then select File  Get Info from the menu bar, then under the Open with section select the application you would like to use, then select Change All…  <comment197380> and the "Always Open With" does not work for you? <comment197393> That option works, the point is to disable that option for several extensions. <comment197513> Really? I know how to change, what I want is to disable it for some extensions. <comment198103> Clever approach. I assume this would be undone the next time it's necessary to repair permissions on the volume, though.
