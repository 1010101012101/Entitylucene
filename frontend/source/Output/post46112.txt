Is there a way to see the time that a photo was taken on the iPhone? <body> Sometimes I took a photo using my iPhone, and then later on, I wonder how long I have been there at that location, I thought of checking when the last photo was taken, and can tell the time when I arrived, but I found it wasn't easily possible to see what time the photo was taken.  Is there really a way to see the time that photo was taken, be it 1 hour and 20 minutes ago, without using any third party app and without importing the photo to a computer?  I thought this might be a simple photo info thing that might be invoked by some easy way?  <answer1212> To view the EXIF data (time taken, GPS coordinates, and other values) of your photos on the iPhone you will need a 3'rd party application. I could only find these two on the app store:  ul liExif &amp; IPTC Metadata Browser/li liExif Wizard/li /ul  <answer1213> You are not missing anything, the iPhone has no mechanism to see that information natively. However, if you search for EXIF on the App Store, there are a few (some free) apps that will happily do that in the device itself.   You must note that, due to the way iTunes work, pictures coming from iTunes will strongnot/strong have their metadata associated. Sad but true.  <answer32021> Instead of looking on App Store for EXIF, also search for term 'metadata'... there is a free app named 'Photo Metadata Viewer' from Boxo (??) that dumps this info to screen for fairly easy reading. NOT fancy, but free.  <answer35469> Some other camera apps give access to EXIF data. Camera+, for example, has an info button in its lightbox picture-viewer which shows EXIF data and even shows a map detailing where that picture was taken.    Note this is helpful even if you're looking for EXIF data in photos taken with standard iOS photo services, embedded in some other app, as Camera+ can import images from the iPhone's standard Camera Roll.    (I have no connection to Camera+ except as a satisfied user)  <answer46118> Yes - the new mobile iPhoto app shows all sorts of photo metadata (assuming you allowed the camera app to store it in the first place) including the capture time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJWOi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Camera roll and Photo stream are part of the Library, so you should be good to go. You can get the above screen by tapping the i with the rectangle to bring up the information for photos stored in the library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jsNIB.png" alt="info button in iPhoto mobile"  In the case of time, even if you deny location services, it should have the timestamp based on the file's creation date/time.  <answer46318> The free app Camera Awesome allows you to see when a photo was taken.  Open the app and go to the camera roll. Tap the plus button and import the photo you want to view date information for. Select that photo and tap the code(i)/code button. The date and time the photo was taken will be displayed, as well as lots of other useful details.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6C9Sx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46319> There are probably other apps, but ProCamera has this ability.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7tZxU.png" width="320"  <answer47471> A strongfree/strong, lightweight app for this is Exif Wizard (size 0.2 MB).  If you only want to access the timestamp or other Exif data, it makes more sense to install Exif Wizard instead of e.g. Camera Awesome (18.1 MB) or ProCamera (17.4 MB).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrhHx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer65415> iPhoto for iPhone will also show you this along with many other details about the photo (ISO, shutter speed, etc) if you prefer to stick with Apple written applications.  I have started to use iPhoto as a replacement for Photos on my iPhone!  <answer87986> If you want to see what time it was taken without an app, you could simply open the image on a computer using a notepad program of some sort. The time and date will often be within the first few lines of code.  <answer91023> We just released a new app that makes it easy to sort, organize and share your iOS photos by date and location.  Photowerks scans your camera roll and displays your photos similarly to the Apple Photos app, but groups them by date taken or photo location.    Features:  ul liQuickly sort photos by date taken, city, state, country, camera make, or camera model./li liView photos in a grid or list view./li liTap photo to view date taken and location (city, state)/li liShare photos via email, Facebook, Twitter (with photo captions listing photo date and location)/li liCreate new albums in the Apple Photos app./li liView photo details with standard pinch to zoom gestures and swipe to view previous/next photo./li /ul  The app is USD $0.99 on the App Store.  <answer105187> Easy. Hook your iphone to your computer. Open it as an external drive and you'll find a folder with your pics. Right-click a pic and then select properties.   <answer105618> My Photo date will allow you to do that.  <answer129136> Another third party solution (of which I feel obliged to confess I created) is Photo Timestamps. It's an elegant solution to this problem- it displays your photos in a 3 photo grid with the timestamp displayed over the photo's thumbnail  <answer129137> Photo Timestamps is a third party app that provides this information. It's not free, but it's also not $4.99. It's got a really clean, minimal interface (obligatory disclosure: I made it).  <answer139393> I had the same problem and solved it by emailing the photo in question to another computer where I was able to look at the meta data.  <answer161636> Since this took me awhile to find and a few of the apps here are old I thought I would share several iphone date viewing apps.   The ones I have tried:   strongExif Wizard/strong  Good app that I have used for about 2 years. Nothing fancy it just lets you view the metadata. It is only 0.4 MB.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/exif-wizard/id387652357?mt=8/li /ul  strongKoredoko - Exif and GPS Viewer/strong  Good app that I have used for about 2 years. Nothing fancy it just lets you view the metadata. It is only 4.5 MB.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/koredoko-exif-and-gps-viewer/id286765236?mt=8/li /ul  strongCamera Awesome/strong  Ok app. It is 48.5 MB. It doesn't do anything exciting to me. I rather use the regular camera app for taking pictures instead of this because of the size. It can view metadata.   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8/li /ul  The ones I have not tried:  strongFlickd/strong  Size: 0.3 MB   ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flickd/id305580150?mt=8/li /ul  strongPhoto Date/strong  Size: 3.4 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-date/id605218393?mt=8/li /ul  strongPhoto Investigator: View, Edit, Remove Metadata; GPS, EXIF.../strong  Size: 3.5 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-investigator-view-edit/id571574618?mt=8/li /ul  strongPixelgarde/strong  Size: 4.8 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelgarde-photo-privacy-editor/id414677492?mt=8/li /ul  strongMetadata Cut - View and Remove Metadata/strong  Size: 21.5 MB  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metadata-cut-view-remove-metadata/id568689108?mt=8/li /ul  <answer281103> You can do this with the built in Photos app. Open the photo and observe the date and time shown in the navigation bar at the top.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xMcmH.jpg" width="620"  <comment34801> Wow, that Exif Wizard is sweet as hell!  Thanks a ton for that helpful link, I can't believe Apple doesn't have that functionality built into the OS by default. <comment52674> looks cool... except it costs US$4.99 to buy?  I just hoped to see the timestamp and that's it... <comment52710> Similar to [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1211/will-my-iphone-show-me-the-date-stamp-of-a-photo). The answer seems to be not without a 3rd party app. <comment52926> Woot - thanks Nathan! <comment52928> There are other apps like [Camera Awesome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/camera-awesome/id420744028?mt=8) that purport to do the same for free, but I haven't used it. <comment124203> Seems like someone downvoted without a comment. Anyway, your answer is not pertinent to this question. This is about finding the date a photo was taken, whereas your answer is about printing the date on the photo while the photo is being taken. <comment229039> Exif viewer by Fluntro have free app and paid app. Here is link to free app https://appsto.re/us/y71w6.i <comment275687> Also checkout "Exif Viewer by fluntro" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aLHWjPyfOY
