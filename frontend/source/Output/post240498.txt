Is iTunes 12.4.1 available for 32-bit Windows? <body> I couldn't find it on the Apple website, I was only offered the 64-bit version. Maybe that's because I'm using a 64-bit client for the download?  <answer240500> If you make the iTunes download believe you are 32-bit Windows, it will provide you with the 32-bit installer.  Change the user agent string following instructions for your browser (this guide seems to work) to something like codeMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win32, x86; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko/code so it appears you are running 32-bit Windows. Visit the download page again: it should now give you iTunesSetup.exe instead of iTunes64Setup.exe.  <comment295608> [It should support 32-bit](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1814?locale=en_US), but I'm not sure why you'd want it, and it isn't happy about giving me the download either. <comment295610> @JMY1000 The reason I need 32-bit is because I intend to run it under Wine on Linux, and 64-bit is not supported. <comment295611> Also, the 32 bit version purportedly won't run on 64-bit Windows, not sure why. <comment295612> Difficult question, might be better on askubuntu.com. <comment295613> @JMY1000 I'm not asking how to run iTunes under Wine. I already know how to do that. I'm asking how to download the 32-bit version. That question has nothing to do with Ubuntu, and would be off-topic at AU. <comment295614> Fair enough. Figured it out: you have to pretend you're 32-bit Windows. Posting answer now. <comment295615> @JMY1000 Awesome, thanks! <comment295616> Thanks for the tip. I'll just use a 32-bit Virtual Machine. <comment295617> @Fiksdal That works too :)
