This process will wipe out everything on the iPod including passwords. Here's a link to Apple's instructions.  https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204306  Scroll down to a little over half way to the heading: "Erase your device with recovery mode."  I had to do this with a used iPod I bought a few weeks ago.  <comment291477> This will result in the same lock - requesting the original Apple ID to activate the device after an erase operation.
