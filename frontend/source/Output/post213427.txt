Jailbroken iPhone 5s stuck in boot loop and can't be seen by iTunes <body> I got my iPhone stolen and I'm guessing he tried to do a factory reset, but I know jailbreak does something differently with that but it's stuck in a bootloop and I've tried just about everything I can do with iTunes and putting the phone in different modes.  Power + home for 10 sec then just home = Apple update logo then crashes and goes back to boot loop.  Power and + volume = nothing  The computer can't recognize the device, it did once but I don't know what I did but it stopped and went back to unknown.  <answer213535> You can enter DFU mode during a bootloop:  ol liConnect the device to the computer and open iTunes. It won't be detectedâ€”that's fine./li liHold down the power and home buttons together./li liThe display will turn off, then an Apple logo is shown. Keep holding until the display turns off for a second time./li liAs soon as the display turns off the second time, keep holding home but release the power button./li liThe display will remain blank and iTunes will prompt you to restore the device. Now release the home button./li /ol
