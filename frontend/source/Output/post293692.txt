PowerMac G4 MDD Interrupt/Programmers mode? <body> I have a PowerMac G4 Quicksilver, and on the front it has a porgrammers/interrupt button (the button which opens up a debug console in MacOS9).  I also have a few PowerMac G4 MDDs. Is there any programmers/interrupt button on the MDD? Or is one of the unpopulated button pads on the logic board next to the PMU button set up to do that function?  Thanks.
