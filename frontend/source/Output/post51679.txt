Selecting multiple icons in Finder using the keyboard? <body> Is there a way to select icons (using the keyboard) that aren't directly touching? In Windows, I'd press codeCtrl/code+codeDown/code, but it doesn't work in the Finder view. I've tried all the usual keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't seem to work. I can multi-select other icons just fine, but I can't multi-select these two.  The picture explains it better than I could. The icons in this folder are aligned to the grid.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/visdl.jpg" alt="finder view"  <answer51685> You could use kbdcmd âŒ˜/kbd + kbd2/kbd to change to the list view and then just use kbdShift/kbd + kbdDown/kbd.  <answer51717> I thought kbdShift/kbd + kbdDown/kbd should work. I tried and the results were, let us say, special:  When your view is sorted by Name, kbdShift/kbd + kbdDown/kbd does not go the last item.  If your view is not sorted, (Sort By: None), then kbdShift/kbd + kbdDown/kbd selecs the last item as well.  See this screencast. (This is my first screencast, so not a very good one)  <answer52996> The answer, it turns out, is fairly unintuitive.  ol liSelect the last item (the PSD)./li liPress kbdShift/kbd + kbdUp/kbd./li liHold kbdShift/kbd and press kbdRight/kbd repeatedly until you get the selection you want./li /ol  <comment59060> Since it is not working as I expected it, I have deleted my answer ^^ <comment59092> `Shift + down` should work. It does for me. Can you check and confirm? <comment59095> Apparently it works only if the view is not sorted. See my answer. <comment59098> Have you tried shift + right?
