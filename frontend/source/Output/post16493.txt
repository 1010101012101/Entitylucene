What is the best compression utility for Mac? <body> What compression utility can you recommend that supports zip, rar, tar, etc... like 7zip and FilZip on Windows?  <answer16502> Stuffit Expander is a good one that I hear a lot about. The built-in Archive Utility will hand just about every thing except for RAR files. For that I would use UnRARX, which is also free.  <answer16506> My personal recommendation is BetterZip for a small price and the ability to create archives. A free alternative is The Unarchiver but this is limited to archive extraction only.  <answer16508> I like Archiver (formerly known as Rucksack). But it's not free.  <answer16550> I found Keka that is some different to use, but solve the problem. And Unarchiver is a good choice to decompress too.  Thanks all!  <comment18026> The built in utility cannot handle 7-Zip amongst other formats. <comment18044> Fair enough. It's good enough for basic zips and tars but if you need more Stuffit handles it and it's free on the app store or as a stand alone. The option to set it as default is right there in it's settings as well which is nice <comment18076> I choose your answer, because of BetterZip that is a good software. The only problem it's not free as I was looking for.
