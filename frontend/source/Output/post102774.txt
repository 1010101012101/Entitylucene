Why can't Preview export some TIFFs to PNG? <body> Some TIFFs can't be exported to PNG in Preview. What is preventing this and how do I correct it?  <answer102779> This happens when the image is in CMYK.   PNG does not support the CMYK color mode therefore Preview won't suggest it for the export.   <comment120990> So can I convert CMYK to RGB in Preview then? <comment121124> This is not possible in preview directly.
