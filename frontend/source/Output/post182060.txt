Flickr backup/sync with new OS X Photos app <body> Searching for a solution how to use the 1 TB free flickr storage to sync my photo library. I use the new Apple OS X Photos app and don't want to sync with iCloud (just 5GB free storage).  <answer182322> Use the FlickrUploadr application available at this link (which is visible at the bottom right of Flickr's Camera Roll feature).  <comment217164> Thanks, exactly what I was looking for. Surprisingly I didn't see it earlier.
