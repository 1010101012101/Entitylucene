No space even though I deleted things <body> I have an iPad 2, 16 GB version I believe and I have no space available. I deleted everything I could, but yet still says 0 bytes available..I deleted like 50 APPS! Ugh! I just want to update ONE of my remaining apps and I can't even do that! Tried everything like rebooting but no change.   <answer236669> Resync with iTunes so it can refresh remaining space  <answer236709> In Settings  General  storage &amp; iCloud usage  Manage storage  You'll see where the memory is used: the biggest first. You can delete apps/ reduce memory use from there  <answer236723> If you restart the iPad it should update the free space counter.  <answer236853> If you try to buy the Lord of The Rings movie from iTunes, it should give you a "No space left" message. Tap that and it should make more room and update the available space counter.  You could also try downloading this app (https://appsto.re/us/hUYK7.i) and cleaning junk data files once you've done the first step.  <answer287915> I realize this "answer" is really just a question in disguise, but maybe adds to the discussion (or the confusion):  the reason I ended up here is I have the same deleted-apps-no-increase-in-space-available problem.  iPad said I didn't have enough storage space to snap a photo on my iPad.  However it did allow me to take screenshots, something I have literally a kajillion of on here.  iPad does not take good photos, especially indoors, but every now and then I just want to document something or to show someone else later; nothing I really need a perfect photo of.  But screenshots are as beautiful as they are when viewing on the iPad screen.  All that said to say there's no rhyme or reason WHY iPad keeps giving random "manage your storage" dialog box (which it then WILL NOT ALLOW???!) I mean, I deleted my top two apps, Google Earth (never use it, use maps) 35.7 something mb(?) and another similar size I already forget what it was, but something I wasn't using.  Biggest problem, I don't have current OS, as iPad won't load it; have left it overnight to allow it to take its time, still sitting there spinning next day. (yes, I will try to get Best Buy brainiacs to look at it, cos its way out of warranty -ipad2 at least 6 years old!-, so can't even get an appointment at Apple Store.) Any comments, fire way, and thanks.  <comment289652> Go to Settings - General - Storage - Manage Storage, this should give you an idea as to what is gobbling up your space. <comment289749> Of the 50 apps you deleted - how much space were they taking? Lots of small apps won't help if you have data syncing down from iCloud or photos and that will fill more space than you free up. <comment289955> Why Lord of the Rings? <comment290087> @TimMalone Not Lord of the Rings specifically, but that's just a big movie that everyone's heard of. See a very relevant CNET article here: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/out-of-space-on-your-iphone-try-this-magic-trick-to-free-up-more/ <comment290089> Got it, cheers! <comment290639> I did that.. And they were pretty big apps, like 100mb. I eventually transferred my photos onto my computer to get a gigabyte or so.. But thank you both for replying. <comment290932> I've tried that on my iPad and iPhone but it unfortunately did not work for me. I updated my iPad and now it shows the. Correct storage ammounts. <comment290949> @AbbeyGemeinhart Nice. By "updated" do you mean your software (i.e. from iOS 9.2 to iOS 9.3) or do you mean restarted (powered on/off)? <comment346334> Low memory, or no memory, for ipad seems to be a common problem. Standard reply is to go to usage, and delete apps to generate more room. BUT that is not the problem most are having. All my apps total 2.5G. The ipad has 16G. Where is memory going? Is it locked up somewhere? Is the operating system confused? There is very little on my ipad but it thinks it's full. THAT is the problem I think people are having. And have both zero storage, and zero answers. Sorry. <comment363513> As you said, this answer is really a question in disguise. Please don't do this.

It lacks all the details one would need to assist the person asking as well as too broad / vague for all the people trying to help. Let's get a new question up with one specific screen image / picture of a specific warning - then we can pick apart the steps to alleviate that issue.
