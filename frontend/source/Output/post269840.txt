Better image quality on Samsung Smart TV with HDMI wanted <body> I have connected my Mac Mini A1347 to my Samsung Smart TV UE32ES6530 using a HDMI cable. This works out of the box but the display is rather ugly. I already changed the resolution to a lower value using this dialog but for my taste the display is still ugly. What else can I do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m2ZYu.png" alt="SAMSUNG display"  1080p and 1080i render the font hard to read. My current choice is 1366 * 768.  <comment339054> Did you try "Standard f√ºr Monitor"?? <comment339056> Did you try changing the Underscan?
