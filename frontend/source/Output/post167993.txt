How can I delete song from both playlist and iTunes library? <body> How can I delete a song both from a playlist and the iTunes music library when viewing the playlist in iTunes 12.0.1.26.

BTW, I am using OS X, so it's Alt-Ctrl Click. <comment197047> [alt]/ctrl/click is the same as [alt]/right click for those without a right mouse button. They are functionally identical.
