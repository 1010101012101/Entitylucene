Wrong e-mail used for ICloud and it's locked now! <body> I gave it to my friend to use my old Iphone 5S temporarily. He gave it back to me after he used it for a while. I have to give my 6S to a service and use my old 5S for a while. But my friend entered the wrong email address to enter iCloud (like xxxxxxxx@superonine.com  he missed to enter "L"). I can not accept the password and reset the phone. Can somebody help me about it?
