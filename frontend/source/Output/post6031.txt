Recording video to MacBook Pro <body> I have an RCA feed with video. I'd like to capture this video to my Mac. I am looking for a mobile solution, something that does not require a wall plug, although battery power is OK. What methods exist to capture video on a laptop?  Here is a solution (mini portable VCR) that does not use a computer, but if I can get it into my Mac for around that price, it would be preferred.  <answer6060> The Elgato Video Capture takes video from a standard 3-plug RCA feed and records it to your Mac or PC in H.264 (they provide the recording software). It is USB-powered. $99 list, $79 Amazon.  <comment6306> Any idea how to handle having only a single RCA, not three? <comment6324> Two plugs are for audio. Just leave those off, and I'm sure you'll get just video (the yellow one).
