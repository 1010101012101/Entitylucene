Contents of SwiftKey "personal language model" file? <body> I'm considering using Swiftkey on iOS8, and I want to turn on the cloud account. However, I'd like to know what information gets synced in my "personal language model."  The SwiftKey website says:     Typically Cloud works to seamlessly sync your personal language model...   But it never says what info is contained in the personal language model. Do they store or have access to any contextual info (ie: Who did I say this word to), or is it essentially a list of words used with a count of each and some associations (words commonly used together)?
