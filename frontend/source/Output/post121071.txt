How to script a logout while screen is locked? <body> I want to log out a user via a shell script, after a delay. However, there's a few other issues:  ul liUser does not have admin and/or root./li liLogout must complete even if screen is locked./li /ul  Currently, I'm using the shell commands below to log out:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to log out' osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return' /code/pre  This works fine if the screen is active, but if the screen is locked, this fails, because it depends on triggering a window, and then firing an Enter keystroke. As a reminder, techniques like killing loginwindow fail because they require root.  I'm not convinced it's possible; any ideas would be much appreciated.  <answer121074> Can you get system events to do Shift-Option-Command-q ??  something like... (I don't know the exact syntax)  precode'tell application "System Events" to keystroke q with command down option down shift down' /code/pre  <comment141107> I don't think that will work, for the same reason the other trick doesn't work: it requires a carriage return, which won't happen when the screen is locked. <comment144292> This keyboard shortcut doesn't require the user to enter return - it automatically logs you out without any additional interaction. But I don't know if it will work as a script executed while the screen saver is active and locked. <comment146041> When do you want to trigger the log out? After inactivity or on-demand?
