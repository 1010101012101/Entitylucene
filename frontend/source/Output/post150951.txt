Can pmset's ChargeInhibit be used to prevent battery charging? <body> I've been using my MacBook with AC power a lot lately and I thought that if I could use codepmset/code to run on AC power whenever available and keep my battery at roughly 50% that would extend the life of my battery and AC adapter. I know that it's advisable to regularly drain and recharge the battery.  I'm running OS X 10.10, Yosemite, on a mid-2012 Macbook Pro. I read that in Mac OS X 10.6 codepmset/code could be used to prevent the battery from charging.  Is there any way to do this other than putting a piece of tape on the charger?  <comment188757> @GrahanMiln In my question I specifically asked if there were solutions _OTHER_ than putting tape on the charger, which is the top solution in the post this question is marked a duplicate of. Also, this question is linked to other posts where answers mention the SMC stopping charging when 100% is reached. However, I want to achieve a state of maintaining 50% battery while running on AC power. <comment188768> This appears to be a duplicate question. I do appreciate the top voted answer is not what you are hoping for. There are currently four other answers. Between all five they represent the best solutions provided by the community.
