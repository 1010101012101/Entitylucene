Web-based wireless login: remember password <body> When connecting to some wireless networks, the first webpage that I try to load redirects to a login screen.  It becomes possible to access the internet only after logging in.  I'm sure most people here are familiar with the situation.  It seems that OS X is smart about this and it brings up this login screen in a separate window as soon as I connect to the wireless network.  I don't need to open a browser and log in separately.  The system show me the login page as soon as I connect to the network, which is quite convenient.  Question: is it possible to coerce this special window to remember the username and password, like browsers are able to?  <answer93270> The special window is an instance of Safari, just without all the navigation bits.  Why don't you try copy-pasting the URL of the login screen to your browser, typing in your password, and telling safari you want to save it when it asks?  <comment109815> This sounds very reasonable but unfortunately it doesn't actually work.  While Safari does remember the password and offers to fill it, the auto pop up window does not.  I guess this is just a limitation to live with. <comment109820> Well, logic was worth a shot.
