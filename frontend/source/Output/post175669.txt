Script to relocate the menu-bar on dual monitors set-up <body> Is there a script that could be written to achieve this: In System Preferences/Displays... is it possible to relocate the menu bar ...via a script? My set-up is one monitor and a Cintiq. I either work only with the Cintiq, or I work with my 28" monitor several times a day. I always need to go to do this manually. I really wish there was a script that can do this. I tried Automator, but it's not recording the action. :(  <answer175673> You can use a command line utility named cscreen to do that.  You can wrap it in a AppleSctipt script or in Automator.  You can download the cscreenIntel.dmg from the link provided. In a terminal use codecscreen -h/code to output the internal help information.  I have a MBP and a Thunderbolt Display so in a Terminal I want to have codecscreen/code list my displays  precode$ cscreen -l DisplayID  Index     Depth     Width     Height  Refresh 5ac6fa7f       1        32      1440        900     0  3247b0f       2        32      2560       1440     0 use -h to display all usage options $ /code/pre  So to set the Thunderbolt Display to have the menu bar I run the following command:  codecscreen -s 2 -p/code  I can then toggle it back using the same command as the strongIndex/strong shifts.  In AppleScript: codedo shell script "/&lt;path_to&gt;/cscreen -s 2 -p"/code  In Automator add strongRun Shell Script/strong and add command: code/&lt;path_to&gt;/cscreen -s 2 -p/code  Note:  This is a simple toggle if you only have two displays however if you have more then two you'll need to write some logic flow into the script.  You can also use, codecscreen -i &lt;DisplayID&gt; -p/code, e.g. codecscreen -i 3247b0f -p/code to code with the codeDisplayID/code which doesn't change.  This can also just be used in a Terminal as a singular command or incorporated into a shell script without using AppleScript and or Automator.   <answer175678> A simple approach could be enabling "displays have separate spaces" in system prefs/Mission Control. That would enable menubars on both screens.  <comment207276> very nice work here, you get a +1 from me for that. <comment207280> That is not an option in at least OS X 10.8 (and earlier, I'd imagine).
