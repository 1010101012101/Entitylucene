Some of the FAQs that might arise are answered here:   ol liNo I do not connect both the dongles simultaneously/li liYes, I know how to adjust the sharing settings (through this link: Can I share my iMac&#39;s internet connection via ethernet) /li liYes, I switch off and switch on the sharing while changing from one dongle to the other. /li liYes the USB port is functional. /li /ol  I am not able to share my internet via the USB dongle. Why?
