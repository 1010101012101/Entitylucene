Two sets of keyboard-mouse for a single Mac <body> I am wondering, can I have a set of Apple Keyboard + Magic Mouse (both via Bluetooth) at home and one at work and use them automatically on the same Mac? Or is there a restriction in the number of keyboards/mice a Mac can register?  I won't use them in the same time, but I would like to move from home to work and vice-versa without pairing/unpairing any of them each time.
