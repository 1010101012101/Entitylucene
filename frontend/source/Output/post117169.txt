How to log system activity the whole day <body> How can I log my Macs system activity the whole day (on OS X Mavericks)? E.g. memory and CPU usage?  strongUpdate/strong  I tried OsTrack, but it crashes all the time.  <answer117361> The average energy impact column in Activity Monitor shows the average energy (or CPU) use for the last 8 hours:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDqar.png" alt=""  If you have downloaded Xcode, you might use the Activity Monitor template in Instruments:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W3Jyt.png" alt=""  With codetop/code, you can use code-a/code for accumulative display. code-o cpu/code orders processes by CPU use:  precodetop -a -o cpu /code/pre  To track the average CPU use of processes, run codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and add a line like this:  precode* * * * * ps -eco '\%cpu= comm='|sed $'s/^ *//;s/ /\t/'&gt;&gt;~/Documents/cpu /code/pre  Then run codeawk -F$'\t' '{a[$2]+=$1}END{for(i in a)print a[i],i}' ~/Documents/cpu|sort -rn/code later.  <comment136957> Are you looking for software recommendations or help creating a script+launchd job to gather this information? <comment136967> If there is any possibility to log the activity without third party software, a script would be the best solution. But I never used AppleScript before, so I would need the whole script or a software recommendation.
