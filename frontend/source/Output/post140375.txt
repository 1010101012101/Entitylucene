iPod touch 4th generation will not charge, what might be going wrong? <body> I have a friend who has a fourth generation iPod Touch. Today she told me that they had tried five different chargers and she still cannot get it to charge. What might be causing this and how might we fix it?  <comment165474> Did she use the same cable on all 5 chargers, or did she use the cables already attached to the chargers? <comment165477> @IconDaemon not sure, I think she used a different cable at least on one of them. <comment165487> Have a look at the Connector - if there is dust - remove it with a wood-needle toothpick. Had the problem, wasn't able to see it from outside after cleaning worked fine.
