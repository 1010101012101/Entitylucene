Shortcut to display storage information <body> Obsessed with how much space left in Macbook Air 128GB SSD,  I find myself frequently checking the storage information by going to "About this mac" == "More info" == "storage".  Is there a shortcut to do that? keyboard shortcut or desktop shortcut for example.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1aC1H.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer143700> The bottom of any Finder window if you toggle Show Status Bar from the View Menu...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHmgO.png" alt="View Menu"  Will then add this to the bottom of the window [It's selected on a per window basis, as far as I can tell]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUocU.png" alt="Status Bar"  <answer143702> There were a few suggestions here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17472800/how-can-using-applescript-show-about-this-mac  <comment169257> That helps, but i want to have the same storage window, just accessing it more quickly. (btw, I would have upvoted your answer, but the website tells me I must have over 15 points to upvote..)
