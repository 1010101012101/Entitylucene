Trying to boot brand new Mini from SuperDuper Backup - circle with line through it <body> Our Mac Mini went belly up, so I just got a brand new one.  I had a nightly scheduled super duper backup to an external drive, which works fine on other Mac's (i.e. I can boot it up and run)  On the new Mac mini, any attempt to boot from any external drive, will just display the circle with a line through it, then eventually power OFF.  I've reset the PRAM.  Is the latest Gen Mac Mini not capable, or do you think I have a HW issue?  How else can I restore my backup?  It was used as a "server" and had network boot images on it, so it will take a while to recreate all of the services it performed.  Thanks!  <comment199334> What model was the old Mac Mini? What OS was running on the old Mac Mini? The 'no-go' icon is usually an indication that there is a Mac OS X / HW mismatch, i.e. the backed-up OS is too old to run on the new Mini. <comment199400> It's 10.9 on the old mini, (new Mini is 10.10).  The old mini is a Core 2 Duo model (not sure exact model).  I wouldn't think they wouldn't allow this though, no?  It's only one release back. <comment199403> Well, I guess because the new Mini came with 10.10, that 10.9 must not have specific drivers for the newer HW, so I'll have to see if I can boot that external on a different Mac, update it to 10.10, and then boot it up on the Mini.
