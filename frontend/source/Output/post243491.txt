External USB Card reader stopped working (El Capitan) <body> I have two dell displays on my mac mini, both displays have a builtin card reader. For years, I've been able to insert an SD card and it's mounted w/o delay. For the last few months, I've noticed that neither card reader works. (The internal mac-mini reader is fine). The inserted SD card also does not appear in disk-utility, so it's not a "mounting" issue. The USB to the monitor seems fine as I can (and do) use external DVD on USB port next to SD slot.  The card readers (and DVD drive) show up in "system information". Here's what the 'ioreg -b' entries for the card reader &amp; DVD drive show up as:  precode  |     +-o USB3.0 Card Reader@14a33000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000047c, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (72 ms), retain 11&gt;   |     | +-o Bulk-In, Bulk-Out, Interface@0  &lt;class AppleUSBInterface, id 0x100000483, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (70 ms), retain 5&gt;   |     +-o MT1887 @14631000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000f85, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (22 ms), retain 11&gt;   |     | +-o 6238--Storage@0  &lt;class AppleUSBInterface, id 0x100000f91, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (20 ms), retain 5&gt; /code/pre  Any thoughts on how to get the card reader back? (I recently did a OS X reinstall to fix a slow boot problem, so everything should be relatively fresh).  Thanks.  <comment299852> I've a similar setup, 2 Dells off a Mac Pro - & sometimes I notice that the card slots don't work after a cold boot, though they do again after a restart. I've not investigated it further, tbh, it's just been, "D'oh, reboot time.." Re-plugging the USBs to the Dells doesn't work.
