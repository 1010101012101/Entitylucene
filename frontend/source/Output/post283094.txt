App to run Chrome web extensions on iPad <body> I have now moved from Android to iOS. In Android , I used Yandex Browser in which I can use Chrome web extensions. But in the Yandex Browser iOS app f, I can't download chrome web extension.   Does anyone know of a browser on iOS that allows the use of Chrome web extensions?  <answer283125> Unfortunately, there is no such browser. The reasons are the App Store review guidelines, which forbid the execution of downloaded code (such as web extensions).  Your best bet is to download browsers with lots of features built-in like iCab or similar and hope it covers your use-case.  Otherwise, maybe you can achieve what you want by having a desktop browser running somewhere and connecting to that using screen sharing from your iPadâ€¦
