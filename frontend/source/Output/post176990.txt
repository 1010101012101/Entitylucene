Restoring Time Machine backup made on a previous OS X version <body> My macbook pro, running OS X Lion (10.7.5) got stolen last night. Luckily they didn't take my external drive, where I have a Time Machine back up of all my data, which is extremely important to me (mostly, unfinished music productions projects in Ableton)  Since new MacBooks ship with OS X Yosemite, would I able to restore my Time Machine backup on a new laptop?  <answer176991> Yes, the migration assistant can migrate strongfrom/strong an emolder/em version. However it cannot migrate strongfrom/strong a emnewer/em version.  Backup of 10.9 -- System on 10.10 works  Backup of 10.10 -- System on 10.9 does not work  <comment209363> And would I be able to restore to restore all my data (aplications/plugins/ music projects with their corresponding samples and vst patches) with migration assistant? I know that with Time Machine restoring it works just fine (I had to do it once), but I never used Migration Assistant <comment209462> I was referring to migration assistant
