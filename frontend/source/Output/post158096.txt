Is there a way to make the menubar show at all times in fullscreen windows? <body> I'm new to mac and I really like the way you can assign a window to be it's own desktop via fullscreening. However, I have an issue with the default way the menubar works in fullscreen.   I often move my cursor to the top of the screen to click on my tabs in my browsers and editors and accidentally trigger the menubar obscuring my tabs. Other times I'd like the menubar to be available at a glance rather than having to trigger it by mousing up.  Is there some setting or application that will force the menubar to show at all times for fullscreened windows?  It appears I'm not the first to have this issue, but the solutions in this post didn't work for me and based on the comment for the top answer it won't work for anyone.  If there is no way to do this can anyone give me a hint where I can get started writing an application to do this?  PS: Please don't suggest that I simply hold alt when clicking the fullscreen green button or anything else like just resize the window to fill the screen". This doesn't solve my issue because it strips away many of the advantages of fullscreening.  <answer158123> I know this might not be what you actually want to hear, however...  Fullscreen/Menus is an either/orbr You can have one or the other. That's the whole idea, like it or not.  The workaround is to learn the key commands.  Once you do, you'll wonder what the menus were ever for.  BTW, your two scenarios are mutually exclusive &amp; simply require more accurate mousing.  <answer177126> I've been annoyed by this, too, and the simple, yet very, emvery/em painful answer is to hold kbdaltbr/option/kbd and press the green title bar button (which should turn into a + when you hold option/alt)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/davet.png" alt="enter image description here"  If this doesn't make it cover the screen, you can drag the window to one edge and resize it until it does (keep holding kbdaltbr/option/kbd to resize while keeping the window centered; helps this go faster). If you make your dock hide by default, this essentially gives you a "fullscreen" program with the menu bar always shown.  <answer272886> In addition to what others have said (using the codeALT/OPTION + CLICK/code green maximize button), to designate a Desktop Space for one app, you can do a:  ul listrong3 (or 4) Finger Swipe Up/strong to bring up the spaces menu at the top of the screen./li liBring your mouse over the top right and the (+) icon should expand and let you add a new space./li liDrag that space in whichever order you desire (first, second, or last, etc.)/li liNow you can drag your desired app into that space, and (if it's not already...) you can maximize it with the usual keyboard shortcut trick./li /ul  It's worth noting that although codeALT/OPTION + CLICK/code-ing the green maximize button does expand the window to full height, you probably want to combine it as codeSHIFT + ALT/OPTION + CLICK/code to expand to full width and height of your screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DujCg.png" alt="Add your own Desktop Space manually"  Happy Spacing &amp; Maximizing!  <comment185940> Good point, also, if you want help in learning the keyboard shortcuts you can use the excellent CheatSheet app: http://www.cheatsheetapp.com/CheatSheet/ <comment185942> "just learn all the shortcuts" is not viable. Nobody knows all the shortcuts for every program they use. <comment185944> of course not - but you learn the ones for the apps you use most frequently, or dial in your own. Alternatively, don't use fullscreen til you have learned them, or for apps you don't use enough to ever be bothered learning. Long & short is, mousing to & from item to menu & back is inefficient. <comment347486> If you like the isolation of multiple desktops and being able to swipe between them etc, have you considered just adding the "maximised" version of the application to a new space/desktop? As "full screen" is "full screen" its not "full screen minus a bit" otherwise many people could get frustrated that full screen is not full screen :P - You say you lose advantages of fullscreening, maybe if you could elaborate on these advantages you want then would be easier suggest things <comment368059> This is a great solution. However it doesn't work in split screen mode. <comment368060> Mac's window behaviour leaves much to be desired compared to KDE's. To me it was standard behaviour to maximize a window without it forming a second desktop, just remove the clutter of other windows around it. Then have whatever side windows you are working on pinned on top of the fullscreen, with all menu bars intact. Hope they catch up on this. <comment368061> @dorien yep. Another reason I'm disappointed. Apple can do better. <comment368065> @Supuhstar Indeed. Also making a maximized window a separate desktop seems overkill. You can't have windows on top then if you want to float them over it. <comment368072> @dorien - what makes you think that? In fact it's the opposite - a fullscreen app will take up the whole Space, a maximised one can have other apps/windows over it, if desired. <comment368073> @Tetsujin You are right, sorry. Now just a way to maximize to split view easily. <comment368074> For that, I don't know, sorry. Split view is something I can't ever anticipate using. 2x 27" monitors... you don't really need it ;) <comment368120> If you don't already, you can use a 3rd-Party tool like [Hyperdock ($10)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperdock/id449830122?mt=12&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) or [Spectacle ($0)](https://www.spectacleapp.com/), which implement Windows-style window snapping. Note that the system doesn't expect these and some weirdness might occur.
