Battery indicator is showing "Service Battery" notification <body> I upgraded my macbook RAM, but after that when I switched on my MAC it showed my "Service Battery" indicator in battery menu. I installed Battery Health application and it showed following stats.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Db9hP.png" alt="Battery Stats"  Its showing my original battery charge is left at 26%. Does that means I need to change my battery and get a new one. My macbook is 15 inch early 2011 model.  Thanks  <answer94776> Your Mac's battery hasn't reached its maximum cycle count, which for your model is 1000 cycles (see Mac notebooks: Determining battery cycle count):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KCZw5.png" alt="MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011) battery cycle count"  Other factors may decrease battery life, so double-check the battery condition in System Information.app:   ol liOpen codeApple menu/codecodeAbout This Mac/codecodeMore Info…/code /li liPress codeSystem Report…/code/li liOn the left hand side select codeHardware/codecodePower/code and look for codeCondition/code:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FsRUb.png" alt="Battery Condition: Normal"/li /ol  Article OS X Mountain Lion: Battery conditions lists the possible conditions:     strongNormal/strong: The battery is functioning normally.      strongReplace Soon/strong: The battery is functioning normally but holds less charge than it did when it was new.      strongReplace Now/strong: The battery is functioning normally but holds significantly less charge than it did when it was new. You can   continue to use the battery until you replace it without harming your   computer.      strongService Battery/strong: The battery isn’t functioning normally, and you may or may not notice a change in its behavior or the amount of charge   it holds.

Does this means that I need to get it replaced? <comment111215> Yes, definitely. You should get your battery replaced because it is getting faulty.
