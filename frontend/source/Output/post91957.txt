Alternative to iWeb? <body> It seems that iWeb is now long dead, so I am looking for alternative WYSIWYG web editors. Free or open-source would be great, but I wouldn't mind thinking about paying a small fee for a mature piece of software either.  <answer91960> There are a few options, depending on your knowledge on html and css.  I recommend one of these:  ul liRapidweaver. It's not free but it's very polished and you can download a trial./li liSandvox. Also not free. It has a guide for Transitioning from iWeb./li liKompozer: em"a complete web authoring system that combines web file management and easy-to-use WYSIWYG web page editing."/em It's free and open source./li /ul  My advice is to download and try them all.  <answer91961> iWeb Alternatives   ul liDreamWeaver - http://www.adobe.com/in/products/dreamweaver.html/li liFlux 4 - http://www.theescapers.com//li liWeb Acapella - http://www.webacappella.com//li liSand Vox - http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/from-iweb-to-sandvox.html/li /ul  <answer92045> BlueGriffon is free, only the manual is not.  http://bluegriffon.org  "BlueGriffon is a new WYSIWYG content editor for the World Wide Web. Powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of Firefox, it's a modern and robust solution to edit Web pages in conformance to the latest Web Standards."  <answer108616> Try EverWeb (http://www.everwebapp.com). it works very similar to iWeb. Similar interface but with a few new features.  <comment107973> Would Wordpress (maybe together with an OS X application) fit the bill as well? And could you elaborate a bit on what your actual requirements are (use for yourself, for client work, what kind of sites etc.) <comment107977> I would say Sandbox is the closet to iWeb in my experience of trying most of them in answers. But is there any reason you don't want to use iWeb anymore? It still works. <comment107986> @ShaneHsu Well, it works if you have a copy of it. Which I don't :) And now there seems to be no way of purchasing it, other than getting a two year old version of iLife. <comment107987> It would be nice to note that all of these are paid products. <comment107990> @patrix it's for personal use, for myself, to build a basic (only a few pages, mostly static) website without having to fiddle with HTML/CSS or other stuff. What I would like to have are some nice looking existing designs/templates on which to start building and customising my site.
