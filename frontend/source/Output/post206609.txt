Mac Appstore updates repeating each day, even though packages installed already <body> strongNOT Answered/strong. Having looked in /var/log/install.log during two new update requests, I see this on both instances.  precodeSUAppStoreUpdateController: did not start session for 031-10481 (previously installed?) /code/pre  The session number is different for each package of course. strongI can verify that both packages are in fact installed,/strong because running them returns the correct version numbers. The packages are strongCommand Line Tools/strong, and strongSafari.9/strong  Now there is only the question left. strongWhy is the AppStore Update manager listing the updates as being available each day. Even though the packages are already installed./strong  <comment249046> I had this and a reboot seemed to solve this - I needed up with AppStore app telling me I had installed command line tools twice <comment249228> It's driving me nuts. It is throwing errors during install, which is probably causing the repeat. But it won't install either with AppStore, softwareupdate, or Pacifist. <comment249237> How much spare disk space do you have? <comment249239> 226GB on a 1 TB drive
