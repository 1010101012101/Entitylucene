Partition problem with APFS containers in macOS High Sierra <body> As always I'm so impatient and migrating with my main devices to the first developer previews the day they are available.  Which as always bring me only problems but I just cannot help myself.  So this time I wanted to see High Sierra before going all in. So I made a second partition and installed High Sierra in there. However after roughly 10 minutes I felt like I need to update my main partition anyway.   So I did. But now there is the catch. I have 2 partitions and I'm not able to strongmerge them/strong. And in an attempt to fix this situation I converted the second APFS container back to HFS+ and actually split it into two and converted only one back to APFS.  So now I have two APFS containers and one HFS+. Any ideas how to get this back to one and only APFS?  diskutil list:  precode  /dev/disk0 (internal):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk0s1    2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk2         211.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                5.7 GB     disk0s3    4:                 Apple_Boot                         134.2 MB   disk0s4    5:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         32.8 GB    disk0s5    6:       Apple_KernelCoreDump                         655.4 MB   disk0s6  /dev/disk1 (synthesized):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +32.8 GB    disk1                                  Physical Store disk0s5    1:                APFS Volume Untitled                962.6 KB   disk1s1  /dev/disk2 (synthesized):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      APFS Container Scheme -                      +211.3 GB   disk2                                  Physical Store disk0s2    1:                APFS Volume Macintosh HD            167.8 GB   disk2s1    2:                APFS Volume Preboot                 29.3 MB    disk2s2    3:                APFS Volume Recovery                521.1 MB   disk2s3    4:                APFS Volume VM                      1.1 GB     disk2s4 /code/pre  diskutil apfs list:  precodeAPFS Containers (2 found) | +-- Container disk1 B254A72D-19C5-4D2C-B461-3C23F298E454 |   ==================================================== |   APFS Container Reference:     disk1 |   Capacity Ceiling (Size):      32750391296 B (32.8 GB) |   Capacity In Use By Volumes:   78757888 B (78.8 MB) (0.2% used) |   Capacity Available:           32671633408 B (32.7 GB) (99.8% free) |   | |   +-&lt;

There is no command for this operation. I tried on my external SSD. Here is another article for your reference: https://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/macos-sierra-delete-apfs-partition-right-way/  <answer295723> Well for anyone interested in a solution, it's now possible.  I've followed this guide and managed to reclaim all available space and resize my main partition back to full disk space.  Thanks everyone for help and suggestions.  <comment362679> Just wipe it all & start over. You're playing with a beta OS on a beta disk format. Apple has the only working toolset for that at the moment. <comment362685> @Tetsujin That's what I was trying to avoid, but it seems as the only option. <comment364309> @Markus Do you want to remove disk0s3, disk0s4 and disk0s5 and add the free space to disk0s2 without retaining the content of the three aforementioned partitions? <comment364664> @klanomath I want to have one one APFS only volume. So I want to leave /dev/disk0 and inside of that only one container disk for APFS. In my particular case Container disk2 should remain but should have all the capacity from both the second APFS container and also HFS+ disk.
