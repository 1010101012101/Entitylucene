XCode as a debugger, tutorial? <body> I've never used debuggers, except for occasionally GDB's backtrace to find a segfault.  I'm currently working with a moderate sized C hydrodynamics code, where I think it might be time to start using a nice GUI debugger instead of sticking codefprintf/code statements everywhere.  Can anyone point me towards a good getting started tutorial on using XCode (10.7) as a debugger for a C project?  <answer97844> Is the code already setup as an XCode project? If yes, this question has already been answered: Where is there a good tutorial on how to use Xcode's debugger properly? Admitted, most links are dead by now. But google comes up with a lot of useful links, even video.  <comment114876> No, its not setup in xcode at all.  Is that a difficult step in-and-of-itself? <comment114935> It is not difficult. Just an additional step. Xcode even supports building of Makefile-based projects: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Porting/Conceptual/PortingUnix/preparing/preparing.html
