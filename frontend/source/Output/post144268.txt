Slow startup after replaced SSD <body> Two weeks ago, my SSD had been broken due to the "Invalid node structure" error. I cannot fix it by using codefdisk_hfs/code. Then I have to format and re-install, but got another error: "Install Failed: OS X could not be installed on your computer. OS X can't be installed on the disk because a recovery system can't be created. Visit www.apple.com/support/no-recovery to learn more"  Visit that article, then resize the partition and try again but nothing changes.  There is no other way, I have to bring it to the warranty service. They said they replaced my SSD with a new one. But now my Mac boot quite slow: - 10s from console to Apple logo - 30s from Apple logo to login window  It used to boot in ~ 11, 12s, the login window seems appear immediatly after Apple logo.

So, I guess that I also have to update it in Open Directory (maybe in code/System/Library/SystemConfiguration//code), right?  <answer144277> This site works best when using one question at the time, so the answers can be found by others for specific topic, but lets make a exception.  Your problem might be somewhere else (so we need your Console report for that) but to answer your questions:  1- Is there any way to make sure that my SSD has been replaced?  Short of opening the computer and looking at the label on the disk, from outside only way to tell is if you saved the previous UUID and compare it to this SSD in About this Mac.  2- I would like to know what does it actually do from Apple logo to login window?  It starts by finding the boot sector, then it activates the EFI (the boot loader) for OS files, after that it loads the user profile settings and apps.  There is a very good description here.  <answer144342> Problem solved based on this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5582982?start=15&amp;tstart=0  Looks like my OS was installed via Migration Assistant or something like that. So, if you change the Full name in codeSystem Preferences/code -- codeUsers &amp; Groups/code, for some reasons, Open Directory still look for the old one. That's the reason why you got:  precodeSecurityAgent[345]: Could not get the user record from OpenDirectory. /code/pre  No need to change the Full name back to original. The trick is you can change it in Open Directory first:  ul liSystem Preferences/li liUsers &amp; Groups/li liUnlock/li liSelect user -- Login Options/li liClock "Join" (Network Account Server)/li liOpen Directory Utility/li liUnlock/li liDirectory Editor/li liSearch your old Full name/li liIn the right, click "RealName", then change the value to whatever you want/li liSave &amp; Close/li /ul  Then back to Users &amp; Groups dialog, select your user, then change the Full name to the same value as you have put into Open Directory.   Close and reboot to see what happens.  <comment169948> do you still have to old SSD ? <comment169955> You should look in to your Console and report some 50 lines here for us to find out what is it doing at start up. <comment169995> @Buscarì›ƒ: I have updated my original question. Looks like I have to update Open Directory to match with the new user name. Do you know how to do that? <comment169997> Glad you found the actual problem, was not the SSD after all. I am not sure, but first try restoring your permissions with disk Utility. The restore your user (you) permissions (the ACL). Boot in Safe mode, that sometimes fixes problems. Do all above before doing anything serious. <comment169998> Disk permissions has been repaired. I also tried to boot in Safe Mode, then restart into normal mode. Nothing changes. <comment169999> Lets try this in Terminal to fix the mobile account  sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/ManagedClient.app/Contents/Resources/ <comment170000> then this "createmobileaccount -n username" then this "sudo createhomedir -c -u username" <comment170002> @Buscarì›ƒ: mobile account? Notice that this Mac is not joined to any domain. Why do I need to create a mobile account? I'm sorry, could you please explain more? <comment170003> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16969/discussion-between-quanta-and-buscar). <comment170104> You have a corrupt Directory Services database. **You are going to have to wipe the drive completely clean and reinstall on a completely blank SSD via internet recovery or a bootable USB installer.** [Follow these instructions.](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5441492)
