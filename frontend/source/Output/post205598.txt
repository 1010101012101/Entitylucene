Installing *.dmg via CLI <body> How are *.dmg packages installed via the command line?br I noticed that they can be mounted with:    precodeme@MacBook-Pro:~$ open /Users/me/Downloads/installer.dmg /code/pre  What's next?  <answer205599> Assuming that the diskimage contains a package or packages, you would list the packages on the mounted filesystem and then use code/usr/sbin/installer/code  <answer205600> After mounting, you need to cd /Volumes/xyz (where xyz is the mounted volume)  <comment247922> As long as you do not want to specify another destination and your software is in pkg format, you go:  `sudo installer -pkg /Volumes/DMGNAME/PKGNAME  -target /`  Be careful: if your software requires a reboot afterwards, the installer will not automatically do this. You have to do it on your own. (Reference: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20030614230204397) <comment247931> And then do what to install the software? <comment248006> @patrix yep. You should use "hdiutil mount diskimage.dmg" instead of the open command
