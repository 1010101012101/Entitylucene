No Router — SMB not working over WAN <body> My home iMac is connected directly to my modem via ethernet. File Sharing is turned on.  If I turn on Internet Sharing and connect my Macbook to the resulting wifi network, I can access files on my iMac via codeFinder/code → codeGo/code → codeConnect to Server/code → codesmb://&lt;my iMac's internal IP&gt;/code  Since my iMac is connected directly to my modem, I should be able to use the same process to connect from work. I open Finder and type codesmb://&lt;my home's external IP&gt;/code Unfortunately, this leads to an error message ("There was a problem connecting to the server.")  Interestingly, my iMac also has screen sharing enabled. Unlike SMB, this works properly from both home and work.  How can I make SMB work over WAN?  Edit: Despite some security concerns that were raised in the comments, I would still like to know how to do this! I'm actively researching possible risks, but haven't found anything specific, and it's out of scope on this site. I want this to work natively in Finder.  <comment372219> Small addendum I want to quickly note: My "iMac" is actually a self-built Hackintosh Desktop. This should however be completely irrelevant to the actual question. <comment372221> You **never** want to have SMB visible through a gateway. No, no, no. Think of another method... any other method. <comment372222> @Tetsujin Even with a very strong password on it? <comment372223> Have you heard of WannaCry? <comment372226> But WannaCry was due to a Windows vulnerability, no? I'm doing some research now but I'm not understanding how allowing remote smb connections is worse than any other protocol (sftp, etc). My work has a company SMB server which is accessible from off site... do I need to get our IT director to switch that off? <comment372229> SecuritySE would be a better place to ask that question - but for starters https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/155169/is-it-risky-to-allow-smb-traffic-to-the-internet <comment372829> For reasons you don't want route SMB over the WAN, have a look at this post:  https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/141153/107777 <comment373034> I bet your ISP blocks port 135/137/139/445!
