Shortcut to move point to beginning / end of current line <body> I use the Apple Wireless Keyboard - French  The shortcut kbdFn/kbd+kbdLeft arrow/kbd (resp. kbdFn/kbd+kbdRight arrow/kbd) goes to the beginning (resp. end) of the buffer. The shortcuts kbdcmd/kbd+kbdLeft arrow/kbd or kbdcmd/kbd+kbdRight arrow/kbd do not seem to have any effect.  Does anyone know how to set a shortcut to go to the beginning / end of current line?  <answer212344> kbdfn/kbd+kbdleft/kbd should bring you back to the beginning of a document.  This Apple support page describe a difference with what you are experiencing.  Try resetting your keyboard settings in the System Preferences  Keyboard  Also check this SuperUser question to reset FN keys.  <answer212346> You can use Emacs set of shortcuts:  ul liBeginning of the line kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdA/kbd/li liEnd of the line kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdE/kbd/li /ul
