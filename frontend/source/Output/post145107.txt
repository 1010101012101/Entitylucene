FaceTime on MBP <body> I am unable to use the headphones in FaceTime. Without headphones it works perfect but when I plug it in, a mic-icon appears with a crossed mic. And consequently, the people on the other side are unable hear me.  Could anyone please advise?  Many thanks in advance!!  <answer145108> You either have a wrong headset (not one with 3 black rings on the plug) or your microphone is muted or broken.  Open sys preferences audio and see if you see it there in the Input tab.  Does it work with any other app like skype?
