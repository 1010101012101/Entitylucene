Yosemite, how to reset/reinstall network? <body> For some reasons every time I connect to an insecure WiFi, Yosemite cannot route to the DNS servers of that WiFi. The DNS servers are correctly set, just cannot reach them.  And after installing uninstalling a few softs over the years, have a bunch of network interfaces, not sure they're all relevant  precodelo0:     flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384 gif0:    flags=8010&lt;POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1280 stf0:    flags=0&lt;&gt; mtu 1280 en0:     flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 en1:     flags=8963&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 bridge0: flags=8863&lt;UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 p2p0:    flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 2304 awdl0:   flags=8943&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1452 /code/pre  Well, tried to remove all code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/*/code and reboot, the problem persists. Not sure what to do next (besides going to Linux)  <comment223069> all those profiles are in your Network settings, so what is holding you back in removing them? Do you use custom DNS ? <comment223073> No custom DNS - these profiles can be removed **where**? <comment223078> check which DNS is been used with "ipconfig getoption en0 domain_name_server" and try adding Google DNS server. 8.8.8.8 <comment223089> The DNS server is correct (works on my Linux and is identical). I tried adding the google servers, but the problem is the Net cannot route to that DNS server - whichever it is. Checked the routing tables, and the Default goes to that wifi server - seems ok. There must be a problem in the routing somewhere. This is why I'd like to erase / reset all of that! Thanks for helping anyway. <comment223090> Did you run the traceroute yourdomin.com <comment223138> `root@MacBook-Air:~# traceroute  11.12.101.15` gives `traceroute: findsaddr: write: No such process`
