Remove "Recovery HD" Icon from Desktop and Boot Loader <body> I have a dual boot of macOS Sierra and Linux Mint 18 on my 2014 MacBook Air. I just reinstalled macOS (I like to start with a clean slate every once in a while), but now I have some extra icons showing up that I don't want. When I'm in the boot loader, I have this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnLL2.jpg" alt="boot loader screenshot" Before reinstalling macOS, I just had "Macintosh HD" and "EFI Boot" (Linux Mint). I don't want the "Recovery HD" and "Recovery-10.12.2" icons--the "Recovery HD" one doesn't boot anything, and the "Recovery-10.12.2" just boots the same thing as Cmd-R.  When I get to my macOS desktop, I have this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSWcP.png" alt="desktop screenshot"  The "Recovery HD" icon goes away if I eject it, but it comes back every time I reboot.   Any help would be appreciated.
