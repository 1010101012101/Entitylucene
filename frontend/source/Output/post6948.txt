Chrome and Firefox not remembering session <body> I just switched to the Mac, and I installed Firefox and Chrome. For some reason, I can't get the functionality for opening the tabs and windows from the last session to work either browser.  ul liMac OSX 10.6.6/li liFirefox 3.6.13/li liChrome 8.0.552.237/li /ul  I have tried making different profiles and reinstalling the browsers but nothing works.  I have looked everywhere and can't come up with a solution. Any help is appreciated.  strongEDIT/strong: Safari's "Reopen All Windows from Last Session"  also doesn't restore last session windows.   strongEDIT 2/strong: I just noticed that quitting the browser (versus closing it by clicking the x button) and restarting it emdoes/em resume the last session in every browser.  <answer6952> Seeing your comment, this is because when you click the X on a Mac app, you are only closing the window, not the Application itself (like it does in Windows). Therefore you were still in a 'current' session, and that session had no windows.   <comment7471> I guess I have still to learn from the intrinsics of the Mac, but it does make sense. Thanks for the answer.
