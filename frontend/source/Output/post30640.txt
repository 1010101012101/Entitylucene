How to contact Apple about connection issue on bugreport.apple.com? <body> I have been trying to log into their bug reporter system (bugreport.apple.com) for about a month.   Every time I log in, I get redirected to an error page, which tell me to report the problem. The thing is, I have reported the problem through the email-address they provided in the error page and also through the "Report Login Issue"-link at the login page.   I have only received an automated message, which tell me they received the message and I haven't got any other update (and I still can't log in).  I have waited almost a month, what should I do?  Here's a screenshot of the error I get when I log in:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Srr4P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer31239> I tried connecting with Safari (6.0.2), and it wasn't working:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ICgX4.png" alt="enter image description here"  When using Chrome (versions 15 &amp; 25), I am asked to sign-in using my Apple ID on this page: http://bugreport.apple.com/   I have no problem at all:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VE52A.png" alt="A screenshot of the login-page"  Make sure you are using the latest update of your browser. Or use a different one such as Opera, Firefox, etc.  Take note of this, from the page, where you enter your Apple ID credentials:     Note: Safari is the suggested browser for use of the Bug Reporter.   JavaScript and Cookies must be enabled to access the Bug Reporter.   Idle time to disconnect is 120 minutes.   If you have tried with different browsers, and it still doesn't work. I suggest you try repairing disk permissions in your disk utility, if you are on a Mac.  If it still does not work, try downloading the newest Safari, and reinstall it. You can also try this link to the login-page.  <answer31335> Have you tried the form on this page: Bug Reporter Connection Problems - Apple Developer?  <comment35299> Exact same thing here. Same error, tried to contact them in both channels, and all I got was the automated messages (tried 3 times). I also don't know what else to do. <comment35611> It's working for me now, although I had the same problem a month ago. You could try loggin in with a non developer Apple ID (Just a guess / Maybe worth a try). <comment35678> @voidStem I still have the problem. Do you know if it's possible to get an other Apple ID without having to purchase something from Apple. <comment35700> Have you write about this issues to their [forums](https://discussions.apple.com/index.jspa)? <comment35701> @HoLyVieR it is possible using iTunes. Just sign out and register new account. <comment35710> I just tried login with a brand new account and it tells me I have to register has an Apple Developer. Which brings me back to the original case, I have a developer account and I can't log in with it. <comment35821> I do have the latest version of Chrome at home and I also have v17 (dev channel) at work. I also tried with Safari  Windows (v5) at work. I also have to same issue when I try to login in with Safari (Ipod Touch). That's so far 3 different machine and setup I have tried to log in with. <comment35822> It is very strange, I just tried on my iPhone 4, and logged in without any trouble. Can you try this url instead of the original?: https://bugreport.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/RadarWeb.woa/wa/signIn <comment35842> Well that's the sign in page I get redirected to, when you go to bugreport.apple.com <comment35856> Are you certain your developer license hasn't expired? And have you also tried this link: http://developer.apple.com/bugreporter/bugrptform.html taken from: http://developer.apple.com/support/resources/bug-reporting.html <comment35912> Yes, it's the `Report Login Issue` link on the bug report main page that I mentionned in my original post. I still haven't got any reply after a month. <comment35914> I'm not very familiar with how the Apple Developer program works, but I registered few months ago, so I don't think it has expired. I'll give it a go with the bug report form, since all I want to do is report a bug to them. And just how of curiosity where have you been able to find that form ? <comment36202> @HoLyVieR they just answered my e-mail after almost a month. They simply said "it's fixed" and now it's working. No details, but it was certainly on their end. <comment36203> Well for now, I'll just hope, they review bug report from that form and that the bug will eventually get fixed. <comment110876> I'm curious if any of you are still having this issue. I've tried using Chrome/Safari on OSX 10.7, 10.9 and my iPhone, etc., but I'm only ever greeted by this error. I've emailed devbugs@apple.com but have received no reply or resolution. My iOS/OSX developer account is active and works everywhere else it's needed. <comment110879> @somethingkindawierd From my understanding, it just takes a lot of time once you have emailed them. I haven't got any respond too, but it finished by working 2-4 months after.
