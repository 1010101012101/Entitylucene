How to manually restore a iTunes and iPhoto Library? <body> I recently moved to OSX Mavericks from Snow Leopard. I made a copy with Time Machine, perform a clean install and restored some data with the Time Machine backup.  I first tried to recover everything. The SO was a little bit buggy so I wanted to make a better clean installation, so I format again and restored only data and settings. The system is now even more buggy.  So I decided to perform a completely clean install and manually recover all the data I need. To do this I have to manually save all my data. But how can I backup my iPhoto and iTunes libraries? I want to have all the same information I have now, in the new clean system.  <answer115918> Your strongiPhoto library/strong (by default) is located in strong~/Pictures/strong as a package (.photolibrary).br Your strongiTunes library/strong (by default) is located in strong~/Music/strong as a folder.  Copying the entire library will copy all the data (unless you are using referenced media). Your app settings are located in ~/Library/Preferences.  <answer117734> I also just did this, as my previous machines' backup was just littered with old cruft I didn't want to pollute my shiny new computer with :)  I used the built-in terminal command 'rsync' which is a sophisticated Unix file copy tool. It may be overkill for you, but this did the trick for me:  ol liIn Finder, navigate to your Time Machine backup./li liDrill down to Macintosh HD  Users  your name. This will make sure the Time Machine back up data is available./li liRun Terminal/li liThe following command (tailored for your username) will copy everything from your Pictures folder in the Time Machine backup to your local drive:  precodersync --archive --stats --human-readable --progress /Volumes/Time\ Machine\ Backups/Macintosh\ HD/Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Pictures/ ~/Pictures /code/pre/li liThe following command (tailored for your username) will copy everything from your Pictures folder in the Time Machine backup to your local drive:  precodersync --archive --stats --human-readable --progress /Volumes/Time\ Machine\ Backups/Macintosh\ HD/Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Music/ ~/Music /code/pre/li /ol  This will take time, depending on the size of your libraries - took 4 hours for me, but on slow wireless. Wired or local Time Machine drive will be much quicker.  The reason for the complex command is:  strong--archive/strong preserves timestamps, ownership, aliases, etc.  strong--human-readable/strong uses notation like '12.3MB' instead of '12305405 bytes'  strong--stats/strong gives you summary statistics at the end  strong--progress/strong gives you file-by-file progress report at Terminal.  The end result is that your iPhoto and iTunes libraries will be cloned to their new location and look and feel precisely like the originals - everything should be intact. At least, this worked perfectly for me two weeks ago using Mavericks.
