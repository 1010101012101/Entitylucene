How to disable results opening in new tab for Yahoo search <body> I switched to from Google to Yahoo as my default search engine for Safari.   The search itself works fine, but then when I click an item on the search results page, it will open it in a new tab by default, rather than in the same tab that the results were in. I really prefer the latter behavior, because otherwise my browser window quickly fills up with search results tabs that I have no use for. I also don't see myself getting used to manually closing every single search result tab I open during the day.   Hence, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if there's perhaps a way to disable this "feature".   <answer260355> This not an Apple issue becuase it's a Yahoo preference setting  What you need to do is set your search preferences so that search results open in the current tab.  Once you set this, it will be active across all browsers in all platforms.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zyNq4.png" alt="enter image description here"
