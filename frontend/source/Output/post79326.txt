How to set two-sided printing as default in Mountain Lion Preview? <body> Every time I print from Preview app I need to manually click on "Two-sided" checkbox. This is annoying when I have a bunch of documents to print. Is there any way to set "two-sided" as default?  <answer79351> In the print dialog you should save a new preset. Below you can find the steps to do so.  ol liOpen the Print dialog. It will look something like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LWnq3.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liCheck the codeTwo-Sided/code box. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lC5MA.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liGo to the Presets drop down list and click codeSave As.../code img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ePAiI.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liType a name for the preset in the dialog and choose if you want this preset available for all your installed printers or just this one. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptdCl.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow choose that preset in the dropdown list. The next time you will print something the preset will be automatically active, so it will print two-sided as default./li /ol  <comment91659> It worked. Thanks. <comment362762> for some reason for me the double sided option does not appear in the box only when I do it with preview. <comment362763> for some reason for me the double sided option does not appear in the box. <comment362820> @CharlieParker My instructions are for the Preview application. What is the problem you encounter? Perhaps you can upload a screenshot? <comment362885> @CharlieParker Your printer may not be set up properly.
