Program for finding duplicate photos? <body> I used to use Visipics and completely loved it, it's simple yet powerful. However it's only for Windows which I have abandoned. Are there any OS X (Lion) programs that do the same? I'm sure there are, am just wondering if there are any that stand out. After taking all the files from multiple computers and putting them on one hard drive to be organized and regrouped I'm sure there are a lot I will find of varying quality. I would prefer free software, since Visipics is free and worked fine, however if there's something outstanding that costs money I'll consider it.  <answer215496> I got something promising just that with a bundle of some sort a while ago.. I literally have never tried it, but it should be worth checking out for you.

I download it and tested it under OS X 10.8.5 and found duplicates I didn't even know I had.
