Plain text paste on Firefox on OSX <body> kbdctrl/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdV/kbd does plain text paste on Chrome and Firefox on Linux and Windows (removes all HTML formatting from WYSIWYG pasted text).  I think Chrome honours kbdcmd/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdV/kbd, but this doesn't seem to work in Firefox 6.   Is there a shortcut to paste as plain text on Firefox?   <answer23446> If Firefox doesn't support this, you can use Plain Clip as a workaround.  <comment39161> Looks like I am out of luck :(
