My Spotify app won't open, can't be deleted and won't force quit on macOS <body> ...and yet when I try to, a dialogue box tells me I can't delete it because it's already open.  Any ideas what I can do?  <answer283835> Make sure Spotify isn't in your login items (System Preferences → Users &amp; Groups) so it won't automatically start. Log out, making sure to uncheck ‘Reopen windows when logging back in’, then log back in. Try to delete the app now.  <comment358039> Many thanks for that grgarside. It worked. You're a genius (that, or I'm a fool!). Does your screen name have anything to do with the wonderful Scritti Politti, by the way? <comment358073> @McCordMark No problem, welcome to Ask Different!
