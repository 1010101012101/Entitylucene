Check the version of an app installed on iPad <body> Is there anyway to check the version of an app installed on a iPad without connecting back to iTunes on my desktop / laptop?  <answer97011> iOS provides a list with all installed Apps and their memory usage. Tapping on any App on that list will, besides giving you the option to delete it, display the name, the strongversion/strong, its size and how much memory it's using.  The path to access this list has changed through the iOS versions:  strongiOS 9:/strong Settings / General / Storage and iCloud usage / Manage Storage  strongiOS 8:/strong Settings / General / Usage / Manage Storage  strongiOS 7:/strong Settings / General / Usage
