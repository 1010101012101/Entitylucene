String of variable has a space - how do I escape spaces? <body> I'm working on an applescript that pulls old Time Machine backups and places them into a new folder. But if the old computer name has a space in it, that causes an issue in the do shell script command.  Here's an example:  precodeset old_hdd_name to text returned of result display dialog "Input your Time Machine (external)'s Name *Case sensitive*     e.g.,        -Time Machine        -My External Drive" default answer "" set old_time_name to text returned of result /code/pre  So lets say the old_hdd_name is Conners Mac. How could I tell it to look for a space and then add it so it turns out to be Conners\ Mac. If it would work better in C, I could do that there, too.   How would I escape that space?  <answer124170> How about  precodeset a to choose folder with prompt "Select your Time Machine backup:"  set p to quoted form of POSIX path of result /code/pre  This will produce a string with the full path in single quotes: code'/path/to/Conners Mac'/code.
