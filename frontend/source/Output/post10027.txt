How can a keyboard be shared with an iPad? <body> What are the ways for both an iMac and an iPad to strongshare the same emphysical/em keyboard/strong?  If it's possible to share a emregular/em strongApple bluetooth keyboard/strong between both devices without jailbreaking the iPad, I think it would be my favored option.  <answer10028> I don't think you can. Bluetooth is designed such that pairing is two-way (computer &lt;- device). You can't pair to a second device without un-pairing from the first device.  <answer10042> Bluetooth only allows pairing with one device at a time.  <answer10046> This might help you, or at least lead you in the right direction.  http://modmyi.com/forums/iphone-news/716935-synergy-ipad-share-your-mouse-keyboard.html  <answer16406> Theoretically using the computer as a middle man, You could set a hotkey to switch between the two? No program exists to do it though :(  <answer23938> This has worked well for me - especially when I turn off the bluetooth on the current device that has the bluetooth keyboard paired, then turn on the bluetooth on the other.  Sometimes, then pair to the closest device when I power cycle the keyboard.  You have to do the initial pairing on each, but I've not had issues using one Apple Bluetooth keyboard with more than one "computer" - be it a Mac or an iOS device like an iPhone or an iPad.  You of course can't have the one keyboard drive both emat the same time/em - this only works in sequence.  <answer59206> Logitech made a solar bluetooth keyboard allowing keyboard to pair 3 device .

This keyboard can be paired with four devices, paired through Bluetooth with each of the devices just once, and you can then use the Multi-Sync Keyboard with it with just a tap of a button. Another device can be connected through USB.  This keyboard has a numeric keypad built in for those spreadsheet editing, but also features iOS-specific keys for your favorite iDevice. It operates on two AAA batteries, and can also be used in a USB-wired mode if needed.  It retails in the UK at £69.00.  <comment10463> Sounds quite logical. Let's hope there's other ways to not have 2 keyboards on a desk. <comment82940> The [Logitech k760](http://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/hardware-reviews/logitechs-k760-wireless-solar-keyboard-leaves-a-mark-on-all-devices/), I see, thanks!
