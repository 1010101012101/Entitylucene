Can I have a second menu bar on my secondary display? <body> Is there software that will allow you to add a second menu bar to a secondary display? I am using Second Bar, but I was wondering if there was other software out there that would do this. Note that I don't want to emmove/em the menu bar. I know I can move the menu bar in System Preferences. This is not what I want. I want a emsecond/em menu bar.  <answer28475> To the best of my knowledge, no there is not another app that currently provides the same functionality as Second Bar.  MenuEverywhere or DejaMenu provide other workarounds to make menu bar commands selectable elsewhere, but I am not aware of any other program that puts a menu bar on multiple monitors.  <answer84422> Multimon   "adds a menubar to your second (or third, or so on) display and gives you hotkeys to quickly move windows from one monitor to another. You also get a menubar icon to click and move windows. When it does move windows, it automatically scales and resizes them for you to match the target monitor's resolution." - lifehacker  Note: not free ($10)  <comment28563> One app that I've found useful for working with multiple monitors is [DejaMenu](http://homepage.mac.com/khsu/DejaMenu/DejaMenu.html). It gives you the menu bar as a context menu when you press a keyboard shortcut. <comment28631> I never tried Second Bar: why do you want an alternative solution? <comment28645> @Matteo Second Bar is a bit buggy, and I was wondering if anyone else had used something else. <comment32670> @NathanGreenstein BTW, DejaMenu is pretty cool!
