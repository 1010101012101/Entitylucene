Mail app works on one computer, not another -- OS and settings identical <body> There is NO difference at all in the settings between my laptop and desktop computers.  Laptop works. Three mobile devices work. Desktop does not, despite the complete lack of ANYTHING different about the settings across all platforms. The account is configured manually as "other". Any ideas?  Steps I've already Taken:  ul liI have tried rebooting/li liI have tried creating the account again./li liI have tried deleting preferences and starting "clean" because it wasn't already with a fresh install. (note the sarcasm)/li liI have compared all Mail settings on my Mac Pro with those on my MacBook. Every last field is exactly the same, but the tower will not connect to the specified mail server./li /ul  <comment169433> Please be more specific. Are you able to receive mail? Are you not able to send mail? Both? Is the account IMAP or POP? Is Mail.app crashing? What did you delete in the steps already taken? <comment169434> I cannot connect, so there is no sending or receiving. No crashing. Deleted accounts in Mail and remade them exactly as they appear on a working device. Supposedly there's a plist, but none with "mail" in the filename have anything with accounts. <comment169435> Connection Doctor reports "Trying to log in to this IMAP/SMTP account failed. Verify that the username and password are correct." â€” It's EXACTLY THE SAME as what I have working on my laptop. The only thing that has been done differently is that I set up Mail from Lion (or possibly Snow Leopard) then upgraded to Mavericks on the laptop, but the desktop had 10.9 to begin with. That cannot possibly be the problem.
