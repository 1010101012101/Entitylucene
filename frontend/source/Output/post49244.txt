Simple auto-typer with AppleScript <body> I want to make a small application that will type the number 1, wait an interval, type the number 2, wait an interval, type number 3, wait an interval, etc.  This works for typing one number over and over:  precodeon idle     tell application "System Events"         key code 18     end tell     return 2 end idle /code/pre  But I'm struggling to get more than number to work:  precodeon idle     tell application "System Events"         key code 18     end tell     return 2     tell application "System Events"         key code 19     end tell     return 2 end idle /code/pre  This doesn't work. Nor does this:  precodeon idle     tell application "System Events"         key code 18         return 2         key code 19         return 2     end tell end idle /code/pre  I don't know what else to try. Thank you!  <answer49245> Try using codedelay 2/code instead of codereturn 2/code â€” codereturn/code exits from the loop!  <comment56361> I think my problem might be with `return`, is there a better way to delay within a handler? <comment56362> That does the trick. Thank you! <comment56363> Related tip: you can use `keystroke "1"` instead of `key code`. Keystroke lets you type in any text and have it typed for you.
