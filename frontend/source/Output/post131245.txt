How to turn off "Enable WiFi" alert message on iOS? <body> When I disable Wi-Fi and open "Maps" I get the message:     strongLocation Accuracy/strong      Turning on Wi-Fi will improve       location accuracy.   Can this message be disabled?  I know, I can just leave WiFi enabled, but I don't want to do this. When I am in airplane mode, I don't want to get notified that I am offline.  Is there a way to prevent this? I don't want to jailbreak my iPhone. I am currently running iOS 7.1  <answer131257> You could try turning off location services.
