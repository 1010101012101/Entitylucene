I can no longer use Touch ID to unlock my MBP after MacOS 10.12.2 update <body> I used to be able to unlock my MBP by simply using my fingerprint on the touch bar, but after updating to MacOS 10.12.2 using Touch ID is no longer an option. It used to have the indication text on the right side of the touch bar, but now it doesn't. I have to use my password to unlock/login.  I know I must use my password the first time logging in after rebooting, but this happens every time I would need to log in or unlock. In fact, I don't think it's letting me use Touch ID for anything anymore- even passwords.  I haven't changed any settings, but maybe I need to re-kick one of the settings? Here's what they are:  strongLogin Options:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bn7Mi.png" alt="Login Options"  strongTouch ID Settings:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/83RjP.png" alt="Touch ID Settings"  Is there a setting I'm forgetting or something else I can try? Like I mentioned, this worked fine on 10.12.1 before I updated the OS.  <comment346394> Few questions for clarification: 1. How are you locking your computer, 2. If you lock the computer and then click 'swtich user', does it _then_ allow you to use touch ID when the list of users is displayed? I'm having what may be a similar problem. I disabled locking on screen saver, enabled the lock button on the touchbar, and when I lock I can't use touch id to unlock (and in fact often the password box takes 10-20 seconds to appear) <comment346396> After further testing, I've found that if I disable asking for a password when the screen saver comes on it will not accept touch id to log back on when I lock the machine. Irrespective of whether the screen saver is set to lock the machine, the password box takes an eternity to appear. <comment346499> Actually, my problem appears to have been fixed since I updated to 10.12.3... I honestly completely forgot I even had this problem after updating the OS, so I'd recommend if anyone has this (or a similar) issue to upgrade to 10.12.3 (hopefully that's a possibility in others' scenarios).
