What operating system was installed on the original Apple 1? <body> What operating system was installed on the original Apple 1? If there was none, what software enabled users to interact with the hardware?  Im asking this for a school research paper.  <answer178311> According to Mactracker, it was "Apple Integer BASIC with optional Cassette Interface".  <answer178318> I used to own an Apple ][. It had floating-point BASIC installed in the upper 16kb of memory. "Booting" took maybe 1 second - flip the switch - Beep - it's ready.  If you bought a disk drive, the boot loader was in a 256 byte (bytes, singles, no M or k) ROM on the interface card. Apple DOS was written onto every floppy disk and took up about 10kb of RAM.  Some trivia for your project:   ul liThe Apple ]['s documentation included a fold-out circuit diagram of the computer's electronics. Just in case you needed to repair it./li liThe documentation also included the complete source code (6502 Assembler) of the operating system. Maybe 30 pages. Assembler at the time was a 1:1 representation of the machine code./li liI wrote Apple (on paper - no internet back then) asking for the Integer BASIC source code for comparison. They wrote back and said they would be happy to send it, but they don't have a copy. Wozniak apparently wrote Integer BASIC himself, compiled it with a pencil and the Motorola 6502 data sheet, and typed in the resulting hexadecimal opcodes by hand. All bow to the Greatness of The Woz./li /ul  <comment211195> This is incredible and what a genious The Woz is! I am amazed. Thanks a lot for sharing. <comment211233> Great resource you pointed out there. I immediately downloaded Mactracker. Much appreciated. <comment211302> I'm gonna have to ask a related question now... <comment211303> Great. Let me hear your question. <comment211304> I just posted http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178416/what-was-the-mac-that-ran-system-1
