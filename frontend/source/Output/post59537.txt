Launchpad as a Space on Mountain Lion <body> I was wondering if it's possible to make Launchpad a space?  Just like how you can get the Dashboard to show as a space em(System Preferences - Mission Control - Show Dashboard as a Space)/em.  <answer59540> Unfortunately I think you're out of luck. While Launchpad appears in the Applications folder and Dock like a normal application, it's really more of a built in OS feature. You can't make it full screen or assign it to it's own space like a normal app.
