Is Powerpoint located in the same place as Word? This could be causing some issues as Yosemite would have reset some of the permission settings on your desktop during the upgrade.  <comment213272> What version of Word are you talking about?  It's vital to always tell that when asking regarding a problem with this app. <comment213297> You may want to try the suggestions in the following MSFT Questions post: [link](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2008-macword/why-can-i-suddenly-not-open-any-word-files-on-my/e9d150db-171e-4dfc-a456-b9df1ca7b2f6) <comment218188> As a test, see whether you can open the word doc files with this program.   LibreOffice   ...                                                                                                                 And if you are using Office 2011 , check whether you have upgraded to the latest version ?
