How to merge lecture notes from the web into a single PDF file <body> I have some lecture notes which are located at:  www.mywebsite.com/Lecture1.pdf  www.mywebsite.com/Lecture2.pdf  etc  In Automator I currently have done the following:  ol liGet specified URLs/li liDownload URLs/li liCombine PDF pages/li liOpen Finder Items/li /ol  This works, however, I have to manually type in all the URLs in step 1. Is there a simple way to automate all of this (maybe using AppleScript?)? I want something like  precode$list = 0 for $i = 1; $i &lt;= 25; $i++ add "www.mywebsite.com/Lecture" + (toString)$i + ".pdf" to $list end for return $list /code/pre  Edit: I managed to write this code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set i to 1     set myList to {}     repeat while i is not 26         set ur to "http://www.website.com/Lecture" &amp; {i as text} &amp; ".pdf"         set myList to myList &amp; ur         set i to i + 1     end repeat     return myList end run /code/pre  But for some reason the lecture notes are not merged in the correct order. What I get is Lecture 1, Lecture 3, Lecture 2, Lecture 4 etc. I also removed Step 1 from above.  Edit2: It seems I had to put a sort between Step 2 and 3. Now it works!   <answer147226> Easiest Way:  Put all PDFs in one folder.  Select All and Open.  Make sure emView - Thumbnails/em is checked, so you can make sure everything is in correct order.  Click emFile - Print/em.  In Print Window, click emPDF - Save as PDF/em.
