Pf firewall logging <body> I have pf configured and working with rule sets that are logged.   Where is pf logging to? How do I check these logs? How do I configure them?  <answer110867> Generally the PF log file would be stored in:  precode/var/log/ /code/pre  to tcpdump for example you might do:  precodetcpdump -n -e -ttt -i pflog1 /code/pre  for more info do:  precodeman pflog /code/pre  <answer111067> Packet filter doesn't log on any file. It does log on a network interface named codepflog0/code (a special device in Unix-lang), see  precodeman pf.conf /code/pre  You turn on this interface with:  precodeifconfig pflog0 create /code/pre  You suppress it with:  precodeifconfig pflog0 destroy /code/pre  You can follow what does packet filter logs on this interface with codetcpdump/code or codewireshark/code.  <answer281981> For macOS 10.12 the tcpdump command for the logs appears to be broken. Wireshark can be used or Pfloggerd see https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7905793  <comment130516> I checked var log not there. I don't have that interface I am comfortable with that tcpdump command ; I do have a dev pf I'm not sure if that's related ; <comment130517> No wait damit it's osx 10.9 I forgot something I knew it <comment130518> BTW â€” you might be interested in this [nice/simple frontend for PFLists](http://www.hanynet.com/pflists/index.html) <comment130521> I dear god more bash script bombs hey you shady fellow I need cs13 do you have a copy
