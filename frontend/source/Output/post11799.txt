What is the best chat client app for iPod Touch? <body> Does anybody know any best chat client app, where you can connect all your accounts, like GMail, Facebook, etc. Let's say app like pidgin, for example.  <answer11804> I can't say it's the best, but Meebo works pretty well for me, and covers all the services I've ever used. (Cept Usenet ;), it's also got fairly un-annoying interface, and good control over alerts. It also merges all your buddies into one list.  ul liList item/li liAIM/li liWindows Live/li liYahoo IM/li liGoogle Talk/li liMyspace IM/li liICQ/li liJabber/li liFacebook/li liLike 60 or 80 more that I'm not going to list./li /ul  <answer11828> One of the best chat applications around has to be BeeJiveIM.  You can purchase a version that does most IM services that is ad free and supports push.  If all you are looking for is GTalk or FaceBook they have individual apps for those services that are free.  http://www.beejive.com/  <answer11838> I've heard good things about IM+, but never used it. With ADHD, if I've unglued myself from a computer, I should congratulate myself by not IMing people even more. :)  <comment12340> Could you maybe rephrase your question so that it isnÂ´t subjective? (Have a look at the FAQ for questions not to ask here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#dontask ) <comment12345> Does Meebo have ads or want to integrate with some nonsense service they provide (and if so, can it be ignored or turned off)? I'm looking for an AIM/gtalk client for iOS (like the OP), but Digsby (which many of my acquaintances use) is too annoying. I'm willing to pay for no ads, too. <comment12378> This sounds like a prime candidate for Community Wiki. <comment12490> so let's make it community wiki <comment12916> Yeah they have iAds, which is new, I hadn't updated in a while I guess :(..  They seem to come and go though, or only be visible at first maybe. Sometimes they are there other times not. <comment34173> Welcome to Ask Different! We can't tell you what the 'best' app is; everyone will have different preferences. Please feel free to edit your question to request a chat application with *specific features* that you need and tag it with `software-recommendation `.
