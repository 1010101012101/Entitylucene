Sort Apple Mail by "replied to" <body> I'd like to sort my email on whether I've replied to it or not. Apple Mail puts a little replied to icon to the left of whatever emails I've replied to so I know this filter exists.   Thoughts on whether this is possible?  <answer199268> Although strongSorting/strong by reply status is not possible, you can certainly strongFilter/strong by reply status.  Using strongSmart Folders/strong you can collect all replied to messages in one 'folder' and unreplied to in another.  These folders just gather the messages, they do not move them from their original folders unless you delete them.  But this can help you keep mail sorted.  Then you can sort by date or other desired criteria.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MfVnhm.png" alt="New Smart Mailbox..."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nshzY.png" alt="Set up"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEMwNm.png" alt="Sidebar"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnSzKm.png" alt="Sort dialog"
