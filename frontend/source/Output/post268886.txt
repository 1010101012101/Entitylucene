Video does not show up in Photos app <body> I recorded a video using the Google's Capture app on my iPhone 6 Plus. I do this all the time and up until now all the videos would show up in the Videos section of the Photos app after I finished recording. I would then be able to move them to my PC using the cable and browsing within iPhone as a hard drive.  However, this particular video shows neither in Photos app nor in directory on the phone if I browse to it from the PC. The baffling part is that it is still there in the Capture app since I can still view it there.  How can I extract it from the phone as a file?
