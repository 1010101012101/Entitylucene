delay after opening lid display dark until key pressed <body> okay so my MBP Mid 2010 was took a little tumble (it was in a felt sleeve which was inside a backpack) today and since has been acting weird.  when i open the lid, the login screen does not come back on automatically, i have push a key, move a finger or two on trackpad and only then does the display get powered  what to do? I am on OSX 10.8.5 and non SSD, 4GB Ram. Plz help!   <answer108459> Check that codepmset -g hibernatemode/code command in Terminal gives you 3 or 0 and not any other value. If it gives you something else, execute codepmset hibernatemode 3/code (this is the correct default).  Sometimes these settings go wrong for unknown reason.  <comment127187> done, it made no difference to the situation. i must add here that the mac runs fine otherwise.
