Force Mac window to become full-screen <body> I am wondering how to make a window that canâ€™t usually be opened in full-screen (i.e. TextEdit or Dictionary) able to be opened in full-screen by using the full-screen button. Is this possible?  <answer206848> Take a look at Maximizer. It should work for emall/em apps but I haven't checked on it's support. You could also edit app preferences.
