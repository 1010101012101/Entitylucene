macOS Sierra: Selecting from Quick Look <body> The following trick is supposed to enable selecting from a Quick Look preview:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool TRUE /code/pre  â€¦ and then relaunch Finder.  In the past it worked for me, but not longer.  Is this broken in Sierra?  <comment336552> That method broke [as of El Capitan](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205574/copy-text-from-quick-look-in-el-capitan), as a matter of fact. There have been numerous suggestions as to how to get this functionality back, and none that I've found have worked.
