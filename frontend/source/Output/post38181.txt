Bash problem Mac OS Terminal <body> Hi when I pressed the up arrow to see the previous command, it rewrote the current command from half.  Example:  precode21 /usr/local/sphinx/etc &gt;  /usr/local/sphinx/bin/search --config /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx-blog.conf php /code/pre  and when I press the up arrow, it shows:  precode21 /usr/local/sphinx/etc &gt;  /usr/local/sudo /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --config /usr/local/sphinx/etc/sphinx-blog.conf --all /code/pre  and "/usr/local/" before SUDO is from previous command. Do you know where the problem would be? Here is my prompt setting:  precodePS1="\# \e[32;1m\w &gt; \e[0m " /code/pre  <answer38299> I tried around and finally managed to find the error: you need to use even more escape sequences in your PS1 - this should work:  precodeexport PS1="\# \[\e[32;1m\]\w &gt; \[\e[0m\]" /code/pre  note the additional code\[/code and code\]/code that wrap the colour escape sequences.  <comment43238> and when i use BACKSPACE i will delete up to 21 /usr/local/sphinx/etc   /usr/local/       i'm not able to delete /usr/local/ <comment43249> Could you pleas execute `read` on the command line and then press the up-arrow? (you can exit `read` with ctrl+c) In theory, this should give `^[[A` or `\e[A` (reps. `^[[B` or `\e[B` for the down-arrow). Did you maybe configure bind for your arrow keys (eg. in the ~/.bash_profile)? <comment43260> I tried it `18 ~   /usr/local/read ^[[A^[[B^[[A^[[A^[[A^[[A^[[B^[[B^[[B` <comment43350> All of those characters appeared when you pressed the up arrow just once??  If so, then @Asmus is correct and something is wrong with your configuration.
