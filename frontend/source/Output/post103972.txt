Zooming in Google Chrome using the mouse wheel? <body> On Windows and, if I'm not mistaken, on Linux, it's possible to zoom in and out in Google Chrome using the mouse wheel. However, this doesn't seem to be working on Mac OS X.  Does anybody know if this feature can be enabled? Or is there any alternative solution (plugin, script, etc.)?  <answer103980> delThere's a Google Chrome extension you can use to do this./delbr strongNote:/strong This no longer works!  hr  Hold down kbdControl/kbd as you scroll and it will zoom in/out.br strongNote:/strong Use this instead!  <answer103981> You can pinch to zoom, which will simulate kbdCommand ⌘/kbdkbd+/kbd and kbdCommand ⌘/kbdkbd-/kbd  You can also try the extension, which was mentioned by in Danijel's answer.  Otherwise, you can hold down kbdControl ^/kbd and the emscreen/em will zoom in and out. It ends up looking like this though (which I don't think you want):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7Jxh.png" width="400" /  <answer104237> Use Command and the + button to zoom in!  <answer211974> In yosemite, you can activate it at the system level. For example:  codePreferences/code  codeAccessibility/code  codeZoom/code  codeUse scroll gesture with keys to zoom/code  Select code^ control/code  Then use codecontrol/code and the mouse scroll to zoom.  (Alternatively, tough that's not what's asked, in chrome, you can pinch to zoom by default)  <answer224183> Using this extension from taharactrl I was able to zoom with ctrl+mouse wheel on all websites.  OSX El Capitan + Chrome 47  Note : after installing the extension, for it to work on existing opened tabs you have to reload them.  <comment170071> that does not work for me, i always used ctrl+mousewheel also on windows but on mac its not working for me <comment200695> -1 On OS X Yosemite: Tried extension. It said to hold right mouse button and scroll to zoom - that worked on 1 page but inconsistently, and not at all on 9 other pages I tried (including this one). Also, kbdControl/kbd scroll and kbdcommand/kbd scroll don't work by default - that's what the question is. <comment204370> The extension mentioned does not work on recent Macs. <comment204371> Indeed the extension does not work on OS X Mavericks either. <comment294470> The problem with this approach is that it actually zooms the screen. It does not simply change the font size and spacing. (use em's people) <comment318431> Hold down control in some OS should work only if the option [Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21498?locale=en_US) is flagged <comment327922> I can confirm this works under OSX El Capitan & Chrome 54 (Nov 2016).
