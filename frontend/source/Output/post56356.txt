What alternatives exist to FaceTime or iMessages to communicate with Android devices? <body> How can I contact my friends that have no Apple products (iOS or OS X)in similar manner to using FaceTime or iMessage?  <answer56358> Well, you cannot use iMessage or FaceTime with non-Apple devices.  With iMessage on the iPhone, the phone will switch to SMS messages when contacting non-iPhone users, but that's it.  Fortunately, there are alternatives to FaceTime and iMessage that are cross-platform.  Alternatives to FaceTime:  ul liSkype (Mac, PC, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone)/li liTango (PC, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone)/li /ul  Alternatives to iMessage:  ul liKik (iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry)/li liFacebook Messenger (Works on pretty much anything with a web browser)/li /ul  <answer61243> Check up this answer here. I love Talkatone because it uses Google Voice -- unfortunately Google Voice supports only US to provide a Google Voice number (this may change in the future). Anyway, the Google Voice -app is a god-sent for cheap international calls and sync with with Google Contacts and Facebook contacts.  Instead of hacking with apps such as Skype, I chose Google Voice and Facetime/iMessages although it costs a bit to use but better integration and no interest to set up new accounts to new services.  <answer82469> For an alternative to iMessage, check out Viber &mdash; it works on all popular mobile platforms and integrates with their address books.  <answer208106> I recommend Telegram. It's fast, well designed, works on every platform (including web browser), requires no registering ala whatsapp, and provides sophisticated encryption options if privacy is a concern for you.  Using it for years with both iPhone and Android friends without any issues!  <comment172912> Presently, there has been some problems with Talkatone -- so question open again, irritating! So awesome software stopped working :(
