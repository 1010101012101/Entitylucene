Does Family Sharing allow others to see the free Apps that you've downloaded? <body> Does Family Sharing allow others to see the free Apps that you've downloaded or is it just the paid Apps?

The same is true for other content bought/downloaded with your Apple ID (e.g. macOS apps, music, movies, books (iBooks store) and audiobooks).  <answer261759> Yes, but not without looking.
