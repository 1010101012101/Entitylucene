How to stop an app from launching on Login? <body> I have created an app, that sets itself to launch at Login using codeSMLoginItemSetEnabled/code. Here is the code it uses. My question is, stronghow can I manually remove this app from launching at login/strong?  The app does not show under "Login Items", or code/Library/LaunchAgents/code, or code/Library/LaunchDaemons/code or in the code/Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/code, or code/Users/username/Library/LaunchDaemons/code folders. I looked around in code/Library/Preferences/code and codePreferecePanes/code, but I found nothing. The app does load on login.  <answer81822> And if you added it with a helper, like you said, then you should be able to see it in the plist (I think).  Take a look at this:   precode-(BOOL)appIsPresentInLoginItems {     NSString *bundleID = @"com.madebynotion.myLoginHelper";     NSArray * jobDicts = nil;     jobDicts = (NSArray *)SMCopyAllJobDictionaries( kSMDomainUserLaunchd );     // Note: Sandbox issue when using SMJobCopyDictionary()      if ( (jobDicts != nil) &amp;&amp; [jobDicts count] &gt; 0 ) {          BOOL bOnDemand = NO;          for ( NSDictionary * job in jobDicts ) {              if ( [bundleID isEqualToString:[job objectForKey:@"Label"]] ) {                 bOnDemand = [[job objectForKey:@"OnDemand"] boolValue];                 break;             }          }          CFRelease((CFDictionaryRef)jobDicts); jobDicts = nil;         return bOnDemand;      }      return NO; } /code/pre  source: http://blog.mcohen.me/2012/01/12/login-items-in-the-sandbox/  <answer81824> Login items are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist, and can be manually managed in System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - your user account in the sidebar - Login Items tab.  <answer188770> You should be able to stop and remove the helper from codelaunchd/code from the command line. Open up Terminal.app and do  precodelaunchctl list | grep -i com.your.helper /code/pre  Look once you've located the job_label in the third column, you can run  precodesudo launchctl stop com.your.helper sudo launchctl remove com.your.helper /code/pre  The manual for codelaunchctl/code can be found here  <answer188794>    If I remove the app (even when it's not running), I can move it to Trash, but when I try to empty Trash, it won't delete the App.   When it is in the trash, restart the mac in single user mode (start while holding kbdcmd/kbd+kbds/kbd): this will open in a Terminal window, run  precodesudo rm -Rf ~/.Trash/* /code/pre  and press kbdenter/kbd, then restart normally.  <answer293526> You can stop the item from launching with codelaunchctl disable gui/$UID/embundle-id/em/code.  If you don't know the bundle ID, you can find it by typing codelaunchctl list/code. That will list emall/em processes running under your user, with their PIDs in the first column. So, if you saw this:  precode$ launchctl list -   0   com.apple.SafariHistoryServiceAgent 277 0   com.apple.Finder -   0   com.apple.quicklook -   0   com.apple.parentalcontrols.check […] 189 0   com.example.ExampleDaemon -   0   com.apple.java.InstallOnDemand /code/pre  …you could use Activity Monitor to confirm that the unwanted app's PID is 189, which makes its bundle ID codecom.example.ExampleDaemon/code. Then:  precodelaunchctl disable gui/$UID/com.example.ExampleDaemon /code/pre  That's it. There emis/em still a record of the login item on disk, just disabled. If you want to purge it, or just want to learn more, read on.  hr  Counterintuitively (but amusingly?), the list is saved here:  precode/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.$UID.plist /code/pre  That file will look something like this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;com.example.ExampleDaemon&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Yes, the codefalse/code means that an app with that bundle id emshould/em be launched at startup. After running codelaunchctl disable/code, the codefalse/code will change to a codetrue/code. (As far as I can tell, launchd doesn't write these files right away, so you may not see this until you reboot.) You can see the disabled items with this command:  precodelaunchctl print-disabled gui/$UID /code/pre  There's also some extra info about each login item stored here, embut removing it won't stop the item from launching:/em  precode/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/loginitems.$UID.plist /code/pre  Any changes you make while the system is running will be overwritten when you shut down/restart. So, as far as I can tell, the only way to completely remove an item from codedisabled.$UID.plist/code is to reboot in single user mode and make the edits there. Even without having run codelaunchctl disable/code, removing a codekey/code/codefalse/code pair from this file stops the app from launching at login. I'm not going to include instructions for editing these files in single user mode in this answer.  <comment94336> if you remove the app (from the disk) what does the Console say? <comment94338> Thanks for the reply Martin. But I am looking for a way to remove it manually (without the use of program). Where is this PList file stored on the system? <comment94339> That's the issue. The app does not show under the Login Items tab, and it is not listed in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist` either! <comment94377> If I remove the app (even when it's not running), I can move it to Trash, but when I try to empty Trash, it won't delete the App. <comment94464> Oh no problem. The reason why I was adding the code is to see what it's doing. It has got to be in the sanboxed directory of your app perhaps… but I never thought about it. I'll take a look tho' <comment308061> Did you ever find a solution for this? Wondering the same. <comment308065> Seems like some are listed here: /var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/disabled.$UID.plist
