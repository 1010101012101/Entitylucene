Apple Developer Withdraw Currency and exchange rates <body> I would like to ask question related developer program in Apple.  Is it better to receive money in USD form Apple or keep local currency of my country ? I know some friends which has been using local currency (small country) and Apple Exchange rates were terribly, they were actually cutting more than 10-15% from each month due really bad exchange rates.  Then is it better to keep USD ? Can anyone elaborate on that and share experiences ?  <comment341876> This question can't be answered.  "It depends" is the best you can get, making it opinion  based.
