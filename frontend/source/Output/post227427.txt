If there are no external devices, keep the Photos app in Dock and Right-click - Options - Open at login(Uncheck if it's checked).  <answer227445> You probably have a SD card or a device which stores photos plugged in your Mac.  To prevent Photos from auto-opening, follow these instructions:     ul   liConnect the iPhone, camera, SD card, etc to the Mac and let Photos app launch itself as usual/li   liUnder the “Import” tab of Photos app, look in the upper left corner to find the device name, this will indicate which hardware will no   longer automatically activate Photos app/li   liClick the checkbox so that “Open Photos for this device” is no longer selected (likewise, toggling this on would enable Photos app to   open itself again automatically when this device is connected)/li   liQuit out of Photos app, the change is immediate for that device – this can be switched back at any time in the same OS X Photos app/li   /ul      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ygUMF.png" alt="enter image description here"   Via: http://osxdaily.com/2015/05/31/stop-photos-opening-automatically-mac-os-x/
