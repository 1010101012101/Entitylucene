Unvisited sites in Safari Top Sites view <body> I recently had to reboot my Mac as it was behaving very very slowly.  The reboot took a long time as I had to force quit a lot of apps for some reason, and it kept timing out due to apps the would not close.  When it came back up, everything seemed back to normal, but in Safari I noticed 2 new sites in my Top Sites view:  ul lihttp://www.gorillaleak.com/home?/li lihttp://www.usbuildingdigest.com/li /ul  Not liking the look of this, I immediately checked for the Flashback trojan, which I appear to be uninfected with, so it's not that.  I have never heard of, much less visited these sites.  Checking in my history (which I never clear) does't reveal any visits other than "last visited today" for each.  Actually, upon further inspection, the windows were both open in the "no window furniture" mode without any toolbars etc.  Is anyone aware of what may have caused them to appear, and if this is indicative of any fault or security breach that I need to look at?  I don;t understand a) where they came from, and b) how they made it into Top Sites on a single "hit" each?  I am running Safari 5.1.3 on Lion 10.7.3  <comment81101> I hate the Top Sites. Last time I checked, sites were setting cookies by being in Top Sites!
