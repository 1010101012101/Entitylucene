Does iCloud save deleted pictures from your camera and photo stream? <body> Does iCloud save deleted pictures from your camera and photo stream?  For example: If you saved a picture from Google but deleted it from your camera and the photo stream does it still save it to iCloud?  <answer147071> Heard that iCloud automatically backs up your iOS device information daily over Wi-Fi when your device is turned on, locked, and connected to a power source. On your iOS device, go to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup, then turn on iCloud Backup.  <comment173355> possible duplicate of [icloud saving photos does it?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/147039/icloud-saving-photos-does-it) <comment173357> you have to specifically sync to icloud right? â€“
