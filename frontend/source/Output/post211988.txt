Prepare and apply image with Apple Configurator 2 <body> Using the new version 2, I can't seem to do what I need to do.  Our devices are DEP enrolled, so I need to be able to automatically prepare the devices to enroll them in DEP and enroll into MDM.  I've done this using a blueprint, ok so far.  At this point they are supervised and not able to have the MDM profiles removed.  Now I need to apply an image on top.  This image has certain backgrounds, apps in different folders, volume all the way up and other custom settings for accessibility.  The 2nd step is what I cannot figure out.  The blueprint lets you prepare OR restore with a backup, but not both.  Any ideas?
