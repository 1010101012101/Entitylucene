Can an iPhone 5 or later be used as a Bluetooth drive? <body> This question is prompted by this question on Ask Ubuntu, but before I make myself look like an idiot, I should do better research.  Basically, can an iPhone (5 or higher) be used as an external Bluetooth-enabled wireless hard drive for a computer that is running Linux?  (As far as I know, having owned iPhones for the past 7 years, I don't believe you can out of the box, and the only other ways I know require a wifi network and a third party app that spawns an "HTTP/FTP" method of storing and reading files)
