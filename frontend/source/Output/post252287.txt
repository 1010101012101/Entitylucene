I can no longer boot into macOS after resizing my bootcamp partition <body> strongThe Problem:/strong My macOS partition doesn't appear as an option at boot   strongBackground:/strong I had a main el capitan partition and a bootcamp partition. I used the EaseUS program to resize the bootcamp partition from 90GB to 45GB and after rebooting, I could no longer see any option but 'Windows' when holding kbdalt/kbd at boot.  strongMy Initial Investigation:/strong  I took a look at my paritions in three different places: The EaseUS program, codediskpart/code on windows, and the disk utility on macOS Recovery Mode.  On both EaseUS and codediskpart/code, my partitions look fine: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xKwdy.png" alt="EaseUS" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFY8t.png" alt="diskpart" However, in disk utility in recovery mode, it looks a bit different. On the sidebar I can only see one child partition of the SSD (BOOTCAMP). However when inspecting the disk, it shows three partitions (Untitled : 145.36GB, Untitled: 650MB, BOOTCAMP: 48.32GB) and a 'Child count' of 4. I wish I could provide a screen shot, but AFAIK this is not possible with recovery mode.  I also ran first aid on the SSD from disk utility and everything verified as OK.  strongAdditional Comments:/strong I'm a bit out of my depth here  and would really appreciate any advice as to how I can boot into macOS again  strongEdit #1:/strong  In response to @DavidAnderson I am using a an early 2015 13" Retina MacbookPro (MacbookPro 12,1).  My Volume 2 details are as following:  precodePartition 2 Type    : de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac Hidden  : Yes Required: No Attrib  : 0000000000000000 Offset in Bytes: 209735680    Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info   ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------  ---------  -------- * Volume 2         Macintosh H  HFS    Partition    135 GB  Healthy    Hidden /code/pre  And my volume 3 details are:  precodePartition 3 Type    : de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6ac Hidden  : Yes Required: No Attrib  : 0000000000000000 Offset in Bytes: 145570975744    Volume ###  Ltr  Label        Fs     Type        Size     Status     Info   ----------  ---  -----------  -----  ----------  -------  ---------  -------- * Volume 3         Recovery HD  HFS    Partition    619 MB  Healthy    Hidden /code/pre  strongEdit #2:/strong  I was able to fix it with the accepted answer!  I used gdisk and the codet/code command to set the GUIDs as recommended and then used the the expert command codea/code (expert commands are accessed with codex/code) to set the attribute field #49 to get the attribute value recommended. Works perfectly now!  <answer252301> Your second partition should have GUID (Type) of code48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code. The third partition should have a GUID (Type) of code426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code and an attribute (Attib) value of code0002000000000000/code. You will need to correct these values.  A good third party tool used to edit the GPT is codegdisk/code.  Once downloaded, you invoke the command by entering the following in an emAdministrator Command Prompt/em window.  precodegdisk64 \\.\PhysicalDrive0 /code/pre  The command codegdisk/code abbreviates the GUID values. Below are some of the abbreviations.   precodeGUID                                  Abbreviation   ------------------------------------  ------------                        48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     AF00 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     AB00  DE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC     2700 /code/pre     Note if you make a mistake while using codegdisk/code, you can enter a kbdcontrol/kbdkbdC/kbd to exit without saving your changes.   Below is an example of the commands to enter into codegdisk/code. What you need to enter may vary slightly.  precodeGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.1  Partition table scan:   MBR: protective   BSD: not present   APM: not present   GPT: present  Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING PARTITIONS!!  Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to \\.\PhysicalDrive1. Disk synchronization succeeded! The computer should now use the new partition table. The operation has completed successfully. /code/pre  The Mac firmware and El Capitan OS X operation system both rely on the GUID values in the GUID Partition Table (GPT) to aid in determining the format of a volume stored in a partition. Since the GPT contains the wrong GUID value for both partitions 2 and 3, you can not boot your Mac from either of these partitions.  The Windows 10 operating system is a little less restrictive. Windows 10 will look at the contents of a partition and try to determine format of the volume. strongWindows may do this even if the partition has the wrong GUID value in the GPT/strong. This is why windows detects the HFS formatted "Macintosh HD" and "Recovery HD" volumes while the firmware used to boot the Mac does not.  The GUID of codeDE94BBA4-06D1-4D40-A16A-BFD50179D6AC/code represents a Windows Recovery Environment partition. Evidently, you do not have such a partition. When I install Windows 10 on my 2013 iMac, a partition of this  type was created. It is about 450 MB in size and followed after the  Windows 10 partition. Other users have posted their installation of Windows 10 did not create this partition. So if you had this partition, it is possible EaseUS erased it. Anyway, you do not need a Windows Recovery Environment partition for normal use of Windows 10.  <comment313890> My guess would be the GUID's and/or attributes are wrong for the "Macintosh HD" and "Recovery HD" partitions. It may be possible to display these values using the `diskpart` command. After `select disk 0`, you would need to `select vol 2` and then enter `detail part`. Repeat for Volume 3. Post the results to your question. Also, what is the model/year of your Mac? <comment313892> @DavidAnderson Thanks for the response! I've updated my question with the details you asked for. <comment313908> Worked perfectly, thank you! I updated my original question to include the exact steps I took.
