When plugging in a jack device, is there a way to tell the iPhone to shut its speakers or not to? <body> I'm working on a device that uses the iPhone jack for connectivity but doesn't have speakers. It seems that some external devices shut off iPhone's speakers when you plug them into the headphone jack, and some don't. What is happening when the speakers are shut off? Do headphones send a signal back to the phone telling it that they've taken over the audio? Is there a way to control it?
