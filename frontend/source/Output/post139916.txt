Open custom file with keyboard shortcut <body> On my Mac, I have some applications that were recently made in Java that I will be using quite alot. I want to know, is there a way that I can bind a shortcut on the keyboard to open the file?   For eg. CTRL + CMD + OPTION = Open test.jar located on Desktop.  Is there any 'vanilla'  way or if there is, any 3rd party software that can allow me to do so?  <answer139917> You can use strongKeyboard Maestro/strong with a macro such as this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ho5Tb.png" alt=""  <comment164859> Wait never mind sorry, was just a little impatient. Thankyou so much, have been looking for one of these, just perfect! <comment164860> And I had to 'enable' not only the 'macro' thing but also the action itself.
