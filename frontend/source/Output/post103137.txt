iOS7 automatic app update downloads from wrong store, stuck <body> I was using my iTunes account from country A when I installed iOS7, and automatic app updates were turned on.  I then switched to using my country B account so that I could install updates to apps I originally bought on the country B store. The updates to country B apps won't install - an error message tells me to switch to country B's App Store. I'm already in country B's app store.  My guess is that the update for country A was downloaded when automatic updates were turned on, and now it won't install - is there any way to delete downloaded updates?  Really makes me think Apple don't test multiple-country App Store accounts.  <comment121407> Presumably, deleting the affected apps from the phone (or erasing it and setting it up new) haven't solved this? <comment121455> I'm sure erasing my entire phone and setting it up new would work, but that's insanely inconvenient!  If there's no better way, I'll have to delete and reinstall the apps, but many of them have important data (e.g. Google Authenticator).
