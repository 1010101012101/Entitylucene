Is it possible to disable a default keyboard shortcut for a special character, without the use of third-party software? <body> I have set kbd⌥/kbd + kbdM/kbd to execute the command "Paste and Match Style", system-wide. I assigned this custom shortcut at the following location:  emSystem Preferences/em → emKeyboard/em → emApp Shortcuts/em → emAll Applications/em  However, instead of the desired effect of pasting and matching style, pressing kbd⌥/kbd + kbdM/kbd on my keyboard usually types the character codeµ/code instead. Only every so often does my shortcut randomly function correctly.  How can I disable the assignment of this special character to my shortcut, so that the shortcut is dedicated to my user-defined command? I never have the need to type this Mu character, so I have no problem with ridding it from my keyboard entirely.  I understand that one can use a re-mapping program (such as Karabiner.app) as a workaround to accomplish this. But, does Apple offer a embuilt-in/em way to remove special character shortcuts?  <answer284061> As a workaround, since I know you use strongFastScripts/strong, here's a suggestion.  Undo the changes you made in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongApplication Shortcuts/strong  strongAll Applications/strong, by first changing strong⌥M/strong back to strong⌥⇧⌘V/strong, then delete the strongPaste and Match Style/strong emcommand/em you added. Note that you could probably just delete it without first reseting it to its default key sequence, however I do it this way to insure it gets reset properly.  With things back to normal, create an strongAppleScript .scpt/strong using the emcode/em below, saving it as strongPaste and Match Style.scpt/strong in the strongUsers Script Folder/strong (~/Library/Scripts).  precodetell application "System Events" to key code 9 using {option down, shift down, command down} /code/pre  Note that you can also use codekeystroke "v"/code in place of codekey code 9/code, I just prefer to use codekey code/code over codekeystroke/code most of the time.  In strongFastScripts/strong  strongPreferences.../strong  strongScript Shortcuts/strong, assign strong⌥M/strong to: strongPaste and Match Style/strong  Now you will not get the strongµ/strong character when pressing strong⌥M/strong when strongFastScripts/strong is running.  <answer284065> Apple always uses Option/alt for special characters. Just use Control or Command for the functions you want instead.    <comment358217> The **⌘** key is also already bound to almost the entire alphabet and other characters like **+**, **-**, **[**, **]**, **0** _thru_ **9**, etc. throughout the combined installed apps, so **⌘** is not ideal for two key combo to circumvent a default like **⌥M**, as **⌘M** is set to **Minimize**. My suggested workaround is IMO a good option in this case since I know that rubik's sphere uses FastScript. <comment358237> Ctrl is bound to much less though. The answer is IMHO not correct anyway because it does not actually answer the question but simply propose a workaround. It should have been a comment at most. <comment358406> I think that using the Control key is a fine idea. My gripe is that Apple surely is aware that the majority of Mac users never have the need to type any special characters. Yet, they continue to dedicate a number of shortcuts to these esoteric symbols. I guess that Apple's rebuttal would be... _"How many people need more keyboard shortcuts than the dozens of shortcuts that the ctrl key provides?"_ <comment358461> @rubik'ssphere Apple gets 2/3 of its sales from outside the US in fact spends a lot of effort to localize MacOS and iOS and provide easy modes of input for languages other than English.
