How to make a message appear on the screen? <body> I'm trying to set up a kind of strongintercom/strong system between Mac, Windows, and Linux boxes at home.  strongQuestion/strong: How can I make an arbitrary message appear on the graphical screen of Mac OS X?  For instance, I'm looking for a command such as:  precode$ show-message "Time for dinner!" /code/pre  which shows emTime for dinner!/em on the graphical screen, maybe in a dialog box.  <answer113998> Yes, this would be fairly trivial with ssh to gain access to the Mac and then run whatever command you prefer.  ol liIs there a way to add items to notification center through terminal or other means? - which covers SeNotifier and the more general purpose terminal notifier which both leverage OS X's notification center app for the GUI./li liHow can I trigger a Notification Center notification from an AppleScript or shell script? - which covers both AppleScript and Terminal scripts - either of which will work when called from ssh from Linux, Mac or Windows remotely. It also adds in Growl2 as a GUI for messaging on OS X./li /ol  <answer114006> bmike provided a link at which mivk suggests another quite lightweight solution: cocoaDialog (Mac OS X 10.4+)  <comment133639> I think you're going to have a very hard time to do this cross-platform. Windows has `netsend`, but a quick Google search shows there's no easy equivalent on the Mac. Growl has some network announcement capabilities and is available for [Mac](http://growl.info/) and [Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/) so maybe that's a possibility. <comment133653> Just did it! `kdialog` and `cocoaDialog` over `ssh` do the job in Linux and Mac respectively.
