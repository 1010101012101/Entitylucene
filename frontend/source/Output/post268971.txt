Prevent full screen applications from rearranging when plugging/unplugging monitor <body> At work I have my laptop and monitor arranged like this:  precode              +---------------------------+               |                           |               |                           |               |                           |  +------------+          Monitor          |  |           ||                           |  |  Laptop   ||                           |  |           ||                           |  +----------------------------------------+ /code/pre  I am a big user of the full screen feature, and typically have my screens arranged like this:  precode                Laptop                             Monitor +-----------------------------------+     +-----------------------+ |           |           |           |     |           |           | | Messages  |  Outlook  | Desktop1  |     | Desktop2  |  Chrome   | |           |           |           |     |           |           | +-----------------------------------+     +-----------------------+ /code/pre  My issue is that when I unplug my monitor, the screens rearrange in an unintuitive manner:  precode                     Laptop +-----------------------------------------------+ |           |           |           |           | | Desktop1  |  Chrome   | Messages  |  Outlook  | |           |           |           |           | +-----------------------------------------------+ /code/pre  As you can see, it decides to move the screens from the laptop to the right of the monitor screens. What I'd ideally have is the two desktops combining, the laptop screens to the left and the monitor screens to the right. This seems like what it should do anyway, since my settings have the laptop screen to the left of the monitor. Here's the ideal situation:  precode                 Laptop +---------+---------+---------+---------+ |         |         |         |         | |Messages | Outlook | Desktop | Chrome  | |         |         |         |         | +---------+---------+---------+---------+ /code/pre  Is there any setting that would force the screens to keep their positions relative to the window arrangement settings?  I am running MacOS 10.12.2.
