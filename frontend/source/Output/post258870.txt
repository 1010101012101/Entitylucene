Configure new IMAP mail account in IOS 10 <body> I am trying to configure a new mail account for IMAP.   In iOS 10, I go codeSettings/code  codeMail/code  codeAccounts/code  codeAdd Account/code  codeOther/code  codeAdd Mail Account/code. After I supply my Email and password at this time, iOS seems to attempt connecting with POP and if this works (which is the case) does not offer IMAP as a choice. So how can I configure an IMAP mail account with iOS 10?  <answer258871> Mine doesn't do that - maybe it fails to connect over POP for some reason. However - try putting in the wrong password - it'll fail to connect and should present you with the manual server options so you can input everything yourself.  <comment323729> It could also be autodiscovery thats problematic for your domain. Do you have a DNS SRV record: _autodiscover._tcp.yourdomain? Is it your domain, or some public domain (ie hotmail) that apple might configure differently (as pop)? <comment323804> @Niklas it is a public domain. <comment323805> Simple and effective. Thx.
