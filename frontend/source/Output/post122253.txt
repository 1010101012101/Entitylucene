How to rename all images together in OS X Mavericks? <body> I am looking for the easy way to rename all images, or other groups of multiple files, together in OS X Mavericks.  Is it possible with Preview or any other standard OS X application?  <answer122258> h1Automator/h1  You can use OS X's strongAutomator.app/strong to quickly rename batches of images. The Actions you want are:  ul liGet Selected Finder Items/li liRename Finder Items/li /ul  Using this approach you can rename files, change the case, or append/remove specific parts of the original file name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbbss.png" alt="Automator rename workflow"  You can create droplet like applications using Automator to make the whole process a single drag-and-drop. Alternatively you can set up a folder action to rename any image dropped into a folder.  To learn more about using Automator, see Apple's Mac Basics: Automator.  <comment142647> Alternately you can save a workflow as a "Service" which is then available through Finder.  This is what I use to batch rename files.
