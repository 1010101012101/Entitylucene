One-click save to Downloads folder in Mail.app <body> When I click on an attachment in Mail.app, the file opens in the mail downloads in my library. I can Ctrl-click on the attachment to save it to my Downloads folder. How can I save the file to the Downloads folder in one click?  I'm using 10.8.  <answer224647> I don't think it is directly possible. However, you can right-click on the attachment and select "Save to Downloads folder".  <comment272486> I don't think what your asking is possible however as a workaround you could set a Rule that saves attachments to wherever you want via AppleScript.
