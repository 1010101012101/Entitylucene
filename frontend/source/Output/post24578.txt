Remote connection to Time Capsule <body> I've found the link below which provides useful info on how to configure Time Capsule for remote connection.  I've followed this and am able to connect to remotely manage the TC (via Airport utility) but still cannot connect in order to access files.  I'm trying from a Windows PC.  How can I access my Time Capsule remotely?  <answer24603> The first thing to check is if the Time Capsule was told explicitly to share the files over the internet using bonjour or simply sharing to the WAN.  Have you verified that the active profile on the Airport is set to allow this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZ3zv.png" alt="enter image description here"  My example has these turned off (you can see them under the guest access control)  <answer70964> Make sure that you have a clear path to the Internet in terms of firewalls, and ensure that strongTCP port 5354 and UDP ports 4500 and 5353 are open and unrestricted/strong.  Once you've done that, make sure you are logged into iCloud on your computer, and that the remote Time Capsule is on (also making sure those ports are unblocked on that end). Your disk should now be available via FTP and AFP.
