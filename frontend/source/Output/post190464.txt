FTP not working on any FTP client not even with Mozilla or Chrome <body> I am using a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10.3. I am a developer and I use FTP on a regular basis. However I am new to OS X. It was working fine but suddenly FTP stops working for all FTP clients on my Mac for any server, even for ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/. I use NetBeans and use its most native Java based client. I tried with Firebug, FileZilla, Firefox, Chrome and OS X's native Finder client. I tried with Terminal as well â€” the response is:  precodeTousifs-MBP:~ tousifosman$ ftp -v ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/ Trying 63.245.215.56... Connected to ftp.mozilla.org. 421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection. ftp: Can't connect or login to host `ftp.mozilla.org' /code/pre  However I am able to connect to all the servers from my Windows platform.  <answer190467> I do not normally use the FTP but here is the result for comparison.  precode~  ftp -v ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/ Trying 63.245.215.46...
