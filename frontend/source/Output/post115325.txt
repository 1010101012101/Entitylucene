Can't open files after upgrading to Mavericks <body> After upgrading from ML to Mavericks (MB Air, 13", 256GB, 2011) I can't open strongany/strong file or folder from the standard Open menu from strongany/strong app (except MS Office -2011). But, I can search for a file (and open it) if it has a label. All the files/folders are greyed out so can't select them, as it can be seen in the attached screen capture (from Preview.app).  If I try to save a file, the only place I can do that is in the default folder: if I try to change the folder (navigating through the Save box) I can't save it any more.  What I've done (nothing worked!):  ol lirepairing permissions/li lidelete and create a new user (keeping the emuser/em folder in /Users)/li liupdated to 10.9.1/li /ol  It is worth to point out that this only happens in strongmy/strong user account: after discovering this situation I created a second admin user and everything works fine within it!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4qxW.png" alt="This is a screenshot of the Open menu.

If it works with another user, it may be something in you're Library folder that is causing the problem. I would also check you're startup items under System Preferences:Users:Login Items. Another thing that could help is check you're logs in the Console Application and see if it is reporting anything unusual there.  <answer131569> As James Payne stated, I did not solve the problem, instead I emdeleted/em it by re installing the SO. I couldn't try the solution proposed by njboot because I did it before his/her suggestion.  <comment154413> Thank you, but I solved this… by re-installing the SO… <comment154417> Can you add your solution as an answer below and accept it? This will make it easier for others to find it later. <comment154421> You need to reset your Home Folder Permissions and ACLS in Reccovery Mode for the specified user account: http://pondini.org/OSX/Password.html <comment154552> Did you actually solve the problem or did you just delete the problem by reinstalling you're OS. Thanks for the vote down for trying to help. <comment154593> I didn't vote down you! I am not such an a..h..le to do that to someone who's trying to help me! <comment154682> Oh ok no worries. Somebody else must have. Just as a matter of interest, this actually happened to me once where I had bound my OSX account to a OS X OD server. To get my files back, I just unbound from the directory. Does that sound familiar? <comment154944> Not at all! I just updated from 10.8.X to 10.9. And that was all!
