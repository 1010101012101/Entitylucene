How to view Export Mailbox status in Mail App? <body> How to view Export Mailbox status in Mail App?  I am trying to archive my mails: I created a Smart Mailbox, which includes the mails received in last year, then right click Export Mailbox to a code.mbox/code file.  In the User Interface of Mail App, no export progress/ status is being displayed. How can I view the export status?  I can now only guess the export status is complete or not by checking the code.mbox/code filename contains code.partial/code or not.  <comment195952> do you have a mail box with 20 Gig size? <comment195960> The smart mailbox is around 10GB size so far. Backup took around 2 hours.
