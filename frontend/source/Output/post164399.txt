Holding down key on 3rd party keyboard fires keypress repeatedly <body> I'm using a PLU ML-87 mechanical keyboard on OS X 10.10.1, although this problem was reproducible on 10.10 and the 10.10 betas. I have never run 10.9 on this computer.  When I hold down a key on this particular keyboard, the keypress event fires repeatedly. This is perhaps best illustrated through this video of me holding down the caps lock key or through the below image, which shows the codekeypress/code event in javascript being fired more than one time when I held down a key in an input box:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1os9.png" alt="screenshot of key being held repeatedly"  Plugging the keyboard directly into the Air's USB port rather than a hub does not change anything.  <comment192741> System Preferences - Keyboard, Keyboard tab, Key Repeat slider control, Delay Until Repeat slider control both. You can set the Key Repeat slider to Off.
