Why "Documents & Data" is consuming so much space in iPhone? <body> Looking at the strongiTunes/strong storage information associated to my iPhone 5S, it seems that Documents &amp; Data occupies around strong3.5 GB/strong of space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MkJw.png" alt="enter image description here"  On the other hand, on the iPhone, Documents &amp; Data stored on strongiCloud/strong are around strong300 MB/strong (so much less).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9VD4.jpg" width="320"  Which value should I trust? Moreover, if iCloud just requires 300 MB to store documents and data, what is the meaning of the 3.5 GB data that appears on iTunes?     <answer232263> Well it is normal. You can refer to this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201656  strongIf storage amounts on an iOS device differ from what you see reported in iTunes/strong     Since iTunes categorizes cached files as Other, reported usage for   Music or Videos might differ. To view usage on your iOS device, go to   Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage.
