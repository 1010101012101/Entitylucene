Decreasing resolution of screenshots increases file size <body> I've noticed that on my rMBP, when I try to make a screenshot smaller using Preview.app version 6.0.1 (Tools - Adjust Size).  When I'm trying to decrease the image size to upload it, the file size often increases.  Compare these two files:  ul liThe first one is 3.3MB. Resizing it to 70% of the resolution results in a file size of 2.1MB./li liThe second one is actually a screenshot of the first image. It's 4.5MB, but again resizing it to 70% results in a file size of 5.2MB. Resizing it to only 99% results in nearly double of the size (8.6MB)./li /ul  How can this happen? What is going on here?  <comment105823> Are you resampling the image when you change it's size within preview? <comment105839> I'm sorry, what do you mean? The only thing I do is open the Adjust Size dialog, change the metric to percent, adjust the size and confirm it, and save the file.
