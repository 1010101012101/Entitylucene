Can't run an ova file <body> I download virtual box from http://www.modern.ie/en-US/virtualization-tools#downloads and extracted it. When I tried to run ova file, I couldn't.  precode$ sudo ./"IE11 - Win8.1.ova" ./IE11 - Win8.1.ova: ./IE11 - Win8.1.ova: cannot execute binary file  $ ./"IE11 - Win8.1.ova" -bash: ./IE11 - Win8.1.ova: cannot execute binary file  $ ls -l "IE11 - Win8.1.ova" -rwx------  1 alex  staff  3834711040 Mar 28 15:02 IE11 - Win8.1.ova /code/pre  The same failure from Finder, it said   precodeThere is no application set to open the document “IE11 - Win8.1.ova”. /code/pre  <answer141546> You can't run .ova files from Terminal as they are not a binary file, hence the error. ova files are for VirtualBox, so you need VirtualBox to be able to open the file. Download VirtualBox from virtualbox.org.  <comment166805> isn't this - ova file - a Virtual Box itself? <comment166807> @Alex [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) is an application, ova files are for VirtualBox. You need VirtualBox to be able to open the files in the same way you need Photoshop to open a psd.
