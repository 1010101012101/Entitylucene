iOS 9.3.5 Mail takes 4 GBs even though no mail account is been set up <body> I have an iPad Air 2 with iOS 9.3.5 installed. I recently noticed Mail took ~4.5 GBs, so I decided to remove the only e-mail account I have set up. However, removing the account and restarting the iPad only cleaned up 500 MBs - the storage menu still shows that Mail takes 4 GBs. What's going on, and is there a way to manually (perhaps with iExplorer?) delete the old caches?
