Accessing the default path for the user keychain folder via terminal <body> By default, user-domain keychains are placed in code~/Library/Keychains/code. Can this path be changed and, if so, is there a terminal command to print out the configured location?  For context, I have a ruby gem and I'm trying to play good citizen rather than hardcoding the location.  (I know you can add a keychain from any location, but I'm referring to the default path that keychains reside in)
