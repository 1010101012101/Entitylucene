Macbook Pro shows "no battery available" while _un_plugged? <body> My wife's Macbook Pro (13-inch Mid 2012) has had issues for the past year or so where it immediately turns off at random times, with no obvious pattern with respect to whether the power adapter is plugged in or it is powered from the battery.  Recently, it has started showing the battery icon with an X through it and the menu text "No Battery Available" just above the menu text "Power Source: Battery" while the power adapter is emnot/em plugged in.  Any ideas on what these mutually contradictory messages could mean and/or what steps I should take?  <comment362931> It sounds to me like one of two things: 1) a lose battery connection or 2) a failing battery. You can try running Apple Hardware Test and see if the battery fails and if it offers more details. In the case of #1, the solution is fixing the connection; in the case of #2, it's replacing the battery. In either case, you could either take the computer in to an authorized service provider or Apple Store, or, depending on your experience and confidence level, attempt the replacement yourself (note that this assumes the computer is the non-retina MBP. Retinas need to be taken in for battery replaces <comment363494> Thanks very much for the feedback.  Apple Hardware Test (extended version) shows no issues.  We replaced the battery in February, and a few weeks ago, I accessed the battery to check for corrosion or a loose connection, but didn't find anything.  Any idea why the menu message would state "No Battery Available" even while clearly operating on battery power?  We may try an Apple Store next. <comment363537> I can't think of anything. If there's a nearby Apple Store, I would definitely recommend doing that. Good luck!
