Delete favourites and history <body> I have an iPad using Safari as a browser. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFVVN.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see I have a very long list of History and/Favorites in the left hand column. There are hundreds of duplicates. I can get rid of the 1 at a time but I've already deleted several hundred.   Is there any way to delete them all at once?   Or find a way to stop duplicating them.  <answer296244> If you have a Mac, and you are using iCloud, I would recommend that you use the bookmark manager in macOS Safari to delete these. You should be able to select a vast amount of bookmarks using a kbdshift/kbd + kbdclick/kbd.
