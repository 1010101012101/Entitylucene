Any way to change sound output device via Applescript or shell? <body> I would like to change sound output device (like option-clicking the speaker icon in the menubar) via script, but NOT through UI scripting, e.g., launching the System Pref panel.  strongUPDATE:/strong Using @Mateusz solution below, here is an Applescript that, when launched, will give you a popup to select the desired audio output device:  precodeset devices to do shell script "/Applications/Audiodevice/audiodevice output list" set answer to choose from list (paragraphs of devices) with title "Audio Output" with prompt "Select a device" without multiple selections allowed if answer is false then return do shell script "/Applications/Audiodevice/audiodevice output " &amp; quoted form of item 1 of answer /code/pre  (Note: you need to put the codeaudiodevice/code file in code/Applications/code)  <answer213047> There's codeaudiodevice/code command available from whoshacks.  Usage:  ul licodeaudiodevice/code    list devices for input, output, and system audio/li licodeaudiodevice &lt;port&gt;/code    display the audio device for the selected port/li licodeaudiodevice &lt;port&gt; list/code    list available audio devices for the selected port/li licodeaudiodevice &lt;port&gt; &lt;device&gt;/code    set the selected port to use the designated device ("internal" will select Internal Speakers or Headphones, whichever is active)/li /ul  <answer213048> There's switchaudio-osx, command which needs to be compiled from sources.  Usage  precodeAudioSwitcher [-a] [-c] [-t type] [-n] -s device_name /code/pre  ul licode-a/code : shows all devices/li licode-c/code : shows current device/li licode-t type/code : device type (input/output/system). Defaults to output./li licode-n/code : cycles the audio device to the next one/li licode-s device_name/code : sets the audio device to the given device by name/li /ul  <comment257336> I'm trying to install this using homebrew with `brew install switchaudio-osx` but it reports: `switchaudio-osx: A full installation of Xcode.app is required to compile this software. Installing just the Command Line Tools is not sufficient. Xcode can be installed from the App Store. Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build. `  Any way around this? <comment257360> The build procedure of `switchaudio-osx` relies on dependencies etc. defined in Xcode (the application). Somebody who knows his way around Xcode better than I do could probably extract them into a Makefile. <comment257361> @Ze'ev Or you evaluate the risks involved and get the version I just compiled out of my Dropbox https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3188370/SwitchAudioSource
