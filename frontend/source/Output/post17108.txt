How to check if internal HDD spindle is off after unmount <body> I use SSD instead of optical drive in my Macbook MC516LL, so I have bunch of reasons why I wants to keep HDD's spindle off:  ul liPreserve HDD from shock/li liReduce energy consuming/li liReduce overall system temperature/li /ul  I use codediskutil umount HD250/code and it disappears from OSx. So how can I  check if spindle turned off?  Thanks!  <answer17173> codediskutil umount HD250/code - doesn't turn off spindle  strongcodediskutil eject HD250/code/strong - turn off spindle  confirmd by sound and mA usage
