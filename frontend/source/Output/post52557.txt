Where can I find an explained list of emoji (emoticons) used in iOS? <body> Where can I find an explained list of  emoji (emoticons) used in iOS for use on Mac OS X?  Some of them are not quite clear and I would like to see their base meaning (I know that you are free to use them, still as the glyphs they should have an Unicode name).   <answer52558> First, in strongSystem Preferences/strong, under the strongKeyboard/strong tab of the strongKeyboard/strong Preference Pane, be sure emShow Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar/em is checked. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxYGX.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, from the Keyboard menu in the menu bar, select strongShow Character Viewer/strong. In the Character viewer pane, select Emoji. When you select an Emoji, on the right side of the pane, you get a large graphic of the Emoji and a text explanation of the shape. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PsmkO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer52561> When you're in iOS, you can also turn on VoiceOver and it'll read the names of the Emoji as you move around the keyboard.  <answer73343> There's also a list on my web site, that I just made. The list is viewable using a browser with emoji font support; this includes Safari.  <answer79973> Wikipedia has a series of tables at w:Emoji. Additionally, they also organize it by what platform supports what character as well.  <comment86606> I just read your list and was about to post a link to it here as an answer — only to find that you, the person who created it, already posted here! Great work on the list. Have an upvote. <comment86705> Funny. This page was the best resource I found when looking for this information myself, so now hopefully it's better. <comment91301> Awesome! Thanks for the list!!!!! Great reference; now I know what I'm saying :) <comment94099> This works fine on Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 as well. Awesome list. Great work! <comment95398> This is also reachable in most programs under Edit  Special Characters… <comment259577> For anyone now looking for a much better resource that's available on more than just Macs and shows images of the glyphs rendered on several different platforms/environments, check it out here: http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
