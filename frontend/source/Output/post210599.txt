App or Service to Automatically Backup Photos in iCloud Photo Library? <body> This is my situation:  ul liMacBook and iPhone both using Photos.app and both using iCloud Photo Library/li liNeither device has enough local storage to keep the originals, so they're both set to the emOptimize Storage/em option/li liI'd like an automated backup solution for the photo collection in iCloud Photo Library.../li /ul  I've read How do I backup photos *from* iCloud Photo Library - along with other Q&amp;As and pages, so I'm aware I could do things like:  ul liChange the location of the library on the Mac, to an external drive, and switch the setting to *Download Originals.../li liUse iCloud.com to download photos, on any machine with a big hard disk or the current Mac, to an external drive.../li /ul  What I'd prefer is an automated backup process. I know that iCloud Photo Library is fairly new; does anyone know of a Mac app, or an online service, that uses a user's iCloud credentials to take regular backups?  <answer236204> Turn on automatic backups.br Whenever plugged in, locked, and connected to wifi, the device will backup.    Call Apple if you are not sure how to turn on backups.  <comment288951> Backup what is on iCloud already?? To where? Another Cloud? <comment288977> Yep, photos on iCloud... As it stands the iCloud storage is the only complete copy of the photo library... I can manually execute a backup, but an automated process is the way to go... To another cloud? Yeah, possibly. Eg to a backblaze account, or similar. Or... Perhaps it could be done on a local machine, backing up to any storage that machine can see... <comment289012> Turn on automatic backups.

Call Apple if you are not sure how to turn on backups. <comment289112> That won't solve the problem / answer the question... First of all, iCloud backup (general) is different to iCloud Photo Library. Second, neither device in my setup has the entire library stored locally... The "service" that I was hinting at would connect to the iCloud Photo Library, be set to store all the originals / download them, and update a backup every rim the library changes... <comment289124> Right. Turn on iCloud Photo Library. <comment289125> Right. Turn on iCloud Photo Library. But I suggest to call Apple and share here what they say. We'll take it from there.
