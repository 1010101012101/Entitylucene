Why is my MacBook Pro Hanging when using two VGA monitors, one connected to HDMI and the other to a USB port? <body> I have a MacBook Pro that started to hang recently. I'm looking for insights on the cause and potential fixes. The Apple Genius Bar folks did not find anything. It is configured as follows:  Processor: 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory: 8 GiB 1333 Mhz DDR3 Graphics: AMD Radeon HD 6750M 1024 MB Software: OS X 10.9 (13A603) I use it with two VGA monitors, one connected to the HDMI port and one to an USB port.  Recently it started to hang after 60 to 90 minutes of a rebbot when both monitors are connected; I can't use the keyboard, the mouse is no where to be seen, monitor connected to the HDMI port becomes blank, the computer monitor is scrambled, whereas the monitor connected to the USB port seems intact. The only way to regain control is thru a hard reset.  The computer works fine when I reboot it without the HDMI monitor connected.  I took the computer to the Apple store where its GPU was checked, the HDMI connector was inspected and nothing was found out
