Clear cache on OSX El Capitan with Java 1.6.0_65 <body> The gist of my problem is that, due to some libraries (codeXLConnect/code for codeR/code) I am forced to use Java 1.6.0_65 rather than newer versions.  This creates a problem when updating the Excel workbook with the following error:  codeError: IllegalArgumentException (Java): Cell style with name 'date_cell_style' already exists!/code  codeExecution halted/code  Where Cell Style comes from the codeXLConnect/code library and codedate_cell_style/code is the name of the variable.  I am running El Capitan 10.11.3 (15D21).  I figured clearing the java cache would help my issue, but there are no Java options with this current version (or at least, not where I was hoping to find them from here: https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_java_cache.xml)
