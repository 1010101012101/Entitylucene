App Reason 9 keeps Crashing unexpectedly error type X86-64 (Native) <body> I am having trouble with Reason 9 , it keeps crashing with this same error code,  I wish someone could tell me what going on.  I spoke to apple they say Talk to the App developer and also said the app is in need of an update.br I spoke to propellerhead who say the error has only been seen twice in the last 2 years and no one knows the cause,  and well i'm stuck with error reports but dont know what they mean or how to find a solution  The crash seems to happen really unexpectedly sometimes in heavy load although the Reason 9 CPU meter never gets into the Red zone and some times out of nowhere   MY system Config   MAC 27 Late 2015   ul liProcessor 4GHz Intel i7/li liMemory 40GB 1867 DDR3/li liGraphics AMD Radeon R9 M395X 4096 MB/li liSSD 1TB/li liRunning macOS Sierra 10.12.4/li /ul  Can some one help me?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uyRXW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVK1U.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment358704> From the second screen cap of the error, it looks like you're running a _beta_ version of the app: `/Applications/Reason 9 Reason95Beta/Reason.app/Contents ...` Is this a released version of Reason or a beta version? <comment358705> `Segmentation fault 11` is usually an 'Out Of Memory" error. When Reason is running, how much RAM is being used? [This page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12762944/segmentation-fault-11) and [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19522192/segmentation-fault-11-in-c-on-mac) at Stackoverflow may be a clue as to why it is crashing. <comment358867> Thanks yes this was on a beta version but it also happens on the normal version of reason and how can i tell how much ram is being used while i use the application ? <comment358885> Activity Monitor will show you the memory usage. <comment358989> But I mean like History because after the app crashes I guess the ram usage will fall emidiatly , or can I also see ram usage history within Activity Monitor ? <comment359013> With Activity Monitor, you can see RAM usage in real time.
