Where do I start to debug a network problem? <body> I am unable to ping outside of my mac from the Terminal, and yet the internet connection (as seen from Safari) is otherwise just fine.  Where do I start to debug this issue?  <answer50883> Your Mac is probably behind a proxy.  This article explains how to configure proxy settings on your Mac.  If you are behind a proxy, then you probably will not be able to get codeping/code to work.  Otherwise, the first step to troubleshooting a connectivity issue when Safari is working is to use codetraceroute/code to some well-maintained destination.  I typically use google.com.    precodetraceroute google.com /code/pre  If you get the error codeunknown host google.com/code then you have a DNS problem.  Otherwise codetraceroute/code should provide you with information that helps you pinpoint the problem.  <answer50884> I recently dealt with a similar issue you its possible that something is blocking your ping requests. You should try to restart your modem and router (power cycle). This worked in my scenario.  <comment68713> In this case specifying the host ('traceroute -p port host') is helpful.
