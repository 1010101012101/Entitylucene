Is there a way to setup Yahoo mail for push with iOS5? <body> It seems to check it on a schedule, regardless of what I do.br I've tried setting it up to masquerade as Exchange, but was not successful.  <answer32844> Yes Yahoo mail supports push, but failing sometimes. This is how to enable it:  ul liGo to "Settings-Mail, Contacts, Calendars"/li liTap "Fetch New Data"/li liSlide "Push" to ON (you can select Fetch period whatever you like)/li liAlso from "Fetch New Data" page, tap "Advanced" and see that Yahoo! mail account has Push text on the right/li /ul  It is easy to do, but sometimes Yahoo push just doesn't work.
