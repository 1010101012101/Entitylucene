Empty iBooks Share Context Menu <body> When I right click on a book in iBooks and go on share I get only em'None'/em button on it. See image below. How can I fix this bug?  Also when I went to my code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/Books/code to find the emepub/em file directory I couldn't find any third party books I have added to the library; only the ones downloaded from the iBooks Store. However, I was able to open them somehow. So where can I find them?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5lmI0.png" alt="Missing Share Menu Buttons"  <comment339571> Try literally dragging the book out of iBooks to the desktop. This puts a copy* of the ePub on the desktop. (* Note: I believe it's a copy and not the original, but I'm not positive) <comment340006> @NoahL That works for now thanks!
