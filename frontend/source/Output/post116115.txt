Sometimes I can run Civilization V on my 2013 MacBook Air, sometimes not, why? <body> I realise the 2013 MacBook Air doesn't quite meet the game's minimum requirements, but I can sometimes run Civilisation V. Sometimes it loads, fires up the fan, but sits there with a blank screen showing only a few fleeting glances of the game.   The fact that it runs sometimes suggests there are things I can do to help it run on demand. Any ideas on tweaking the system to make it work?   <comment135871> Those times when you are able to run it, are you using the laptop connected to the power source? <comment136391> It's a little hit and miss. I can sometimes run it on battery, but have more success when it is plugged in. Also I notice I chew through battery life much faster than normal, so I guess everything is running at full tilt.
