Can I use both clang and gcc compiler in yosemite? <body> I need gcc as a default compiler to compile cuda samples and I need clang to compile my network projects because clang has  better warnings and errors specifications.  Is there any way to run both compilers?  <answer260660> Yes you can.  Apple's Xcode supplies clang (and puts in /usr/bin/gcc a link to clang not gcc)  Then you can then install gcc - probably the easiest way is via a package manager like Macports, Homebrew or Fink  <comment326408> Why can't you run CUDA in clang? The [cuda install page](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-mac-os-x/index.html) implies clang - and mixing two compilers if C++is problamatic and if C then surely which compiler does not matter
