On iPhone, can I tell if group text messages were delivered? <body> The question is in the subject.  Iphone 6 plus - ios 8.  I know I can tell for individuals, but not for groups - or at least not obviously.  Can I?   <answer176188> You are correct, there are no delivery or read receipts for group messages (regardless of the size). Even when all participants are using iMessage, it will not display either receipt.  I suppose this is for simplicity so there isn't a receipt for every individual in the group.  <answer176189> No, sorry. The reason being is that it saying delivered would have to guarantee that it was delivered/read by each phone and one message would not be able to do that. Maybe Apple will add a more robust system in the future though.  <comment208139> I figured.  Just seems like a dumb thing not to have implemented some way.
