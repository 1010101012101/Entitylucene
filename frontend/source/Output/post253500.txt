Set default application for filetype <body> I see a file of a particular type and it defaults to opening in the wrong program. I right-clicked the file, held down kbdOption/kbd, and selected codeAlways open with/code and then the correct application. The file opened in the right app, but it did not change the default. How can I set the default for a file's type?  <answer253501> Right-click the file and go to codeGet info/code (shortcut: kbdCmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd). There will be an option to set that file's default application. Select it and use codeChange All.../code to make the default apply to all others of the type.  :::::::::::::::::::::::::img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UBl9R.png" alt="Get info, Open with, Change All..."
