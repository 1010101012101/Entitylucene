Cannot get Library First Aid to open using Option + Command in iPhoto <body> I am migrating a bunch of iPhone libraries from one drive to another, repairing them along the way, and migrating them to the Photos app.  However, I cannot get the "Library First Aid" windows to open following the instructions provided by Apple to hold Option + Command while opening iPhoto:     ol   liQuit iPhoto if it is open./li   liHold down the Command and Option keys on the keyboard./li   liOpen iPhoto./li   liKeep the keys held down until you are prompted to rebuild the library./li   liA dialog will appear with rebuild options. Select the options you want to use./li   /ol   For me, the library opens, and I continue holding down the keys but the dialog never opens (minutes later even).  I am running iPhoto 9.6.1.
