how to get google search history back in safari 6 <body> I am very annoyed about safari 6 doing away with the google search history. Is there anyway to get it back? Just to be clear I am talking about when you google something and then you need to go back to that same search. In safari 5 you could click on the the arrow in the google search bar and it would give you a drop down menu of all your latest google searches.  <answer70158> Within a new emwindow/em or emtab/em, clicking on the strongmagnifying glass/strong will drop down the emrecent searches/em menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgTgU.png" alt="enter image description here"  This menu will drop dow, too, if you just type a emspace/em or empty the emsearch bar/em by deleting.   <comment81482> You can also press the down arrow key when the location bar is empty. <comment81483> @LauriRanta Doh! Forgot about that!
