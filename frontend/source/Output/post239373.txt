iOS auto-correct common words to that of brand names <body> I am using iOS 9.3 and my auto-correct is working really weirdly. It will change valid words to those of existing brands. For instance, typing in "guess" will change it to "Guess", even if it is in the middle of a sentence. "subway" will be changed to "Sunstrongw/strongay".  Resetting the keyboard dictionary partly alleviates the problem. "subway" doesn't become "Sunway" anymore, but "guess" still become "Guess"  What is going on?  <comment293788> Try using a different keyboard in the App Store, like Swiftkey or Swype, and see if the issue remains (or if you're using a third-party keyboard, stop) <comment293977> Not using any third party keyboard. I will try another keyboard. <comment293979> Also try resetting your keyboard dictionary: settings, general, reset, reset keyboard dictionary.
