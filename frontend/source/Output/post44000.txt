Moving from original iPad to new iPad (2012): Is a cover like Apple's black one available for the new iPad? <body> I'm upgrading from the original iPad (2010) to the new iPad (2012).  I skipped the iPad 2 and the Smart Cover, so I don't have any compatible cover accessory for the new iPad.  I did try someone else's iPad 2 and Smart Cover before, and while I think the Smart Cover design is emclever/em, it does little to protect the iPad from a fall, or the back from scratches.  And, while the magnets are strong, the Smart Cover emcan/em still separate; i.e. don't have a 4-year-old yank an iPad 2 by the Smart Cover and expect it to stay stuck!  What I would strongreally/strong like to shield my new iPad is something almost (but not quite) exactly like the cover I had for my original.  Of course I'm referring to strongthis:/strong  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NAEAe.png" alt="Original Apple iPad black cover"  What I liked about the original black iPad case/cover is:  ul liit protected both front and back from scratches,/li liit could be folded to stand in two orientations,/li lithe rubber-like material sticking out a bit at the edges made the case absorb some of the shock of a side-impact drop (helpful if you have a four-year-old .. though she's five now and is more careful!),/li liit is tight fitting, and/li liit could be cleaned easily./li /ul  I already tried putting my new iPad into the old iPad case/cover, and some things don't line up (power button, notably), and it's lacking the camera hole at the back, and it's no longer a tight fit since the new iPad is slimmer.  strongIs there a third-party / aftermarket case almost exactly like the Apple one pictured above, but designed for the new iPad (2012)?/strong I'm hoping some company might have closely matched Apple's original design.  <answer44003> Targus is advertising iPad 3 cases and one of their portfolio style cases may suit you.   Many iPad 2 cases will work with the new model. Although I haven't tested any of these on a new model iPad, you might consider:   iLuv Portfolio Case with Stand  Filemate Imagine series smart cover  Beyond that, a search for codeiPad portfolio/code will produce a multitude of choices.  <answer44004> There are many iPad cases up on Amazon, some with the necessary cutouts for the cameras and controls of the iPad 2/3 and some without so be aware.  I have this one for my iPad2 and it's worked quite well. It's slim, has enough padding, has magnets that turn the screen on and off and allows all functionality.  http://www.amazon.com/Genuine-Leather-Case-latest-generation/dp/B004TPG3ZS/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1331934880&amp;sr=1-3  The Case Crown cases are also nice but they're a bit thicker, mine's closer to the slim original Apple iPad case which my wife has on her iPad 1.  <answer74223> em(Thought I should add this answer in case anybody comes across this page.)/em  Since I asked my question originally, of course Apple introduced the strongiPad Smart emCase/em/strong, which combines features from the original iPad case and the Smart Cover.  The Smart Case has a front much like the Smart Cover, but includes a backing part that better protects the iPad.  Reviews here and here.
