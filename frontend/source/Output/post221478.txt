Email with ICS attachment not showing in iOS Calendar Inbox <body> My iPhone has several different email accounts on it - one synchronized with an Exchange Server, one using POP on a Yahoo address, and one connected to a Gmail address.   When I receive an email that contains a calendar invitation (i.e. with an ICS attachment), only an email sent to the Exchange Server account causes the invitation to show in the Calendar Inbox, where you can accept or decline the invite. That also causes a notification on the iPhone.  Why is that? I'd love if emall/em invitations went to the Calendar Inbox and notified me.  Note that this has nothing to do with the strongsource/strong of the email. The ICS attachment can come from anyone who happens to send me a calendar invite. One other note - if someone sends to the Gmail account, the appointment automatically is added to my calendar with tentative status. So that works properly. But I have to click on the entry in the calendar (or in the email) to Accept or Decline, rather than in the Calendar Inbox.  I wonder if there is some simple setting I have overlooked.  Thanks!
