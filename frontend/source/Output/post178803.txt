Is the original photo in an iPhoto library still saved if I trash the photo after dragging it to the desktop? <body> If I move a photo from iPhoto to the desktop, and then trash, is the original still saved in the library?  <answer178805> If you moved it, no.br If you copied it, yes.  It really depends emhow/em you 'moved' it.  <answer178819> h3Yes./h3  You can't move a photo from iPhoto out of the library simply by dragging it. It'll be a copy, therefore deleting it from the desktop will not remove the original from the iPhoto library.  <comment211849> I selected a number of photos (Shift click) and dragged them to the desktop. Then dragged them to the trash <comment211870> dragged from where? iTunes itself, or the Finder?
