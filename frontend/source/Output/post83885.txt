So, dug around Stack Exchange and loosely followed suggestion on this post which recommended codervm get head/code (as opposed to my typical codervm get stable/code) and noticed:  precode$ rvm get head   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current ... 100 1620k  100 1620k    0     0   275k      0  0:00:05  0:00:05 --:--:--  479k  Upgrading the RVM installation in /Users/meltemi/.rvm/     RVM PATH line found in /Users/meltemi/.bashrc /Users/meltemi/.zshrc.

Try the following:  precode$ rvm remove 2.0.0 # get rid of unsuccessful installation $ rvm get head --autolibs=3 # get the latest RVM and build required libs $ rvm requirements # just in case, install all other required stuff $ rvm install ruby-2.0.0 $ rvm --default use ruby-2.0.0 /code/pre  <answer258065> So this worked for me:  precodervm pkg install openssl rvm reinstall all --force /code/pre  I also had codervm autolibs rvm_pkg/code for readline support.  <comment96588> what, exactly, does the `--autolibs=3` flag do? I can't find *any* documentation on itâ€¦ <comment96605> FWIW- I followed your instructions, kind of: `remove 2.0.0` and then `rvm get head` (ignoring the `--autolibs=3` bit). checked requirements. OK. then `rvm install ruby-2.0.0`. and...no problems! It worked! <comment96691> https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/issues/1623 There is some info on `autolibs` flag, as far as I understand, it tells RVM how to handle additional required libs. <comment97759> Documentation for autolibs can be found by running the following cmd: "rvm help autolibs" from the terminal <comment98453> Under OSX 10.8: also `sudo brew install openssl` <comment130595> I had the same problem after upgrading to OSX Mavericks.
