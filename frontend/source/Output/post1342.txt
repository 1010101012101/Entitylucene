To do so:  ol liImport your items into iTunes if not done already/li liSelect them all and choose Get Info from either the contextual menu or the File menu/li liGo to the Options tab and set "Media Kind" to Podcast/li liIt will then appear in the Podcasts section using the Album name as a group/li /ol  <comment1239> What if these are old episodes of an existing podcast? <comment1247> @John Gietzen No idea for sure.
