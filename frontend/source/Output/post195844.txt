Kernel Problems randomly restarting MacMini Late 2012 <body> I have a MacMini (late 2012) running the latest Yosemite version 10.10.4 and I get ocasional random restarts. Sometimes they occur right after I login from one of these restarts, other times it is stable for quite a while (can be hours or days) and then restarts again.  I have unplugged all external peripherals (Firewire HDD and Thunderbolt HDD) but I am still using dual-monitors: one direct HDMI and the other using mini display to HDMI adaptor.  The only modifications I made was to replace the original internal HDD which was very slow (5,400 rpm) to a Crucial SSD 512GB and I replaced the RAM to by Crucial 2x8GB DDR3 - 1600 as well which I believe they are both highly recommended and compatible with Mac machines. The SSD model is Crucial_CT512MX100SSD1. Could it be something related to the hardware replacement?  The two last kernel errors are here: http://d.pr/n/128a5/b5RQaBL8 and http://d.pr/n/1hF51/3BiwFQ6N  I am up to reinstall the whole OSX from scratch if I need to. This was the only way I found to solve a Divx codec issue in the past in a different machine after exhausting all possible  Any help on this is highly appreciated.  Many thanks to all.  <answer198538> If your issue appeared with 10.10.3, I am 98% certain it is a bug in OS X Yosemite, introduced with the 10.10.3 update and related to Intel HD 4000 GPUs. Welcome aboard. The kernel panics are totally erratic, some users have also graphics glitches. The only common feature is having a Intel HD 4000 GPU.  On MacBook Pros with dual GPU you can avoid the problem by strongdisabling Automatic Graphics Switching/strong (System Preferences  Energy Saver).   Please contribute to the thread in the apple discussion forum and file a bug report (with link to the thread).   <answer248969> I faced the same problem. It done for forcefully shut down any file. To solve the problem press kbdCommand/kbd kbdOption/kbd kbdP/kbd kbdN/kbd kbdR/kbd from your keyboard.  <comment237329> I have the same problem and a similar configuration: Mac Mini Late 2012 Fusion Drive. Mac OS 10.10.4. Dual Monitors plugged using both hdmi and Mini-Display (via dvi adapter). I changed the Ram to 2x8GB Samsung one year ago. I didn't have any problem with this configuration for the last 6 months. Did you find a solution? Or re-installed mac OS X from scratch? <comment237451> Hi, Unfortunately I didn't find a solution yet but two things we have in common that may be the reason behind these problems is the RAM change and dual monitors plugged in. However, I have a very strong intuition that the problem may be exactly because of the dual-monitors... sometimes (very rarely) the screens go black and I can never turn them on. I need to force a restart by pressing the off button and then it is fine. I am not using an official Apple Mini-Display adapter which can be a problem as well... just guessing here. <comment240746> I have same problem and I am almost sure it's an OSX bug, since it started about a month ago, while I didn't change any hardware. <comment308670> Welcome to Ask Different.
