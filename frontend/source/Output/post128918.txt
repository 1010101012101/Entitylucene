Split volume for backups <body> I have just got a mac and I have quite a large external drive that I've mainly used for making back ups of important files. Someone told me today that I could plug this into my mac and split it up and use half the space for the Mac and half the space for Windows files. I'm only looking to do this in order to use Time Machine. I wasn't sure how to do this or if it's recommended.  <answer128924> You could absolutely do this. I've been using a setup like that for a while now and it works great.  What you want to do first is backup the files you have on the drive (backup the backup, haha) just so you can create two separate partitions on the drive. Formatting and partitioning the drive will make the data currently on the drive unavailable, so back up anything important!  Now, open up the codeDisk Utility/code application and select the external drive in the left pane of the window. Then click on the codePartition/code button and here you can select any amount of partitions you wish to make. Unless you know you will need more later you could settle with two, one for Time Machine and one for important documents/files.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJ4Ev.png" alt="Disk utility"  Continue by pressing the dropdown menu codeVolume Scheme/code and select code2 Partitions/code. You can now name each one and set their respective sizes, obviously a full Time Machine backup requires a fair amount of space so depending on how many backups you intend to have you might want to give this partition a bit of extra space.  You also want to specify which format (file system) to use for each partition. This is important if you intend to use the drive with other systems, for example Windows and Linux systems are not very fond of codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code (aka. JHFS+). The Time Machine partition should be partitioned as codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code, but the other partition is up to you.  codeFAT32/code (called codeDOS/code or codeMS-DOS/code sometimes) is the standard file system used by Windows (I believe), it can be used with Mac without any problems. The only drawback is that you can only store files that are less than 4Gb each, which is a pain if you handle large video files.  codeNTFS/code requires additional software for Macs to write, but it's (arguably) the most cross-compatible file system if you want to move files between different operating systems.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kG0AB.jpg" alt="Disk utility(2)"  If you're only going to use the drive with a Mac, choose to format both partitions as codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code and press codeApply/code. This will create two new partitions that should work natively with any Mac.  Quick edit: codeExFAT/code can be an alternative to codeNTFS/code, depending on your Windows machine you might need additional software to read/write data to it.  <answer128925> Well, thats right. You have to partition your external hard drive into two partions - one for Mac (formated withHFS+)m the other for Windows (formated with FAT/ExFAT or NTFS). But you couldn´t do this without to loose your data that are already on these hard drive.  If you want to do this:  ol liConnect your external hard drive to your Mac./li liOpen the program "Disk Utility"./li liSelect your external hard drive (be shure that you really select the external hard drive, not the partition)./li liSelect third flag "partition"/li liOn the lower left side click on the Plus sign to get a second partition./li liUse the mover between the partions to correct the sizes./li liFor the Mac partition choose "Mac OS Extended (journaled)"./li liFor the Windows partion choose "ExFAT", "FAT" or "NTFS"/li /ol  That´s all (I hope so).
