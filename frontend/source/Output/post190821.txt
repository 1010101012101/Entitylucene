OSX Yosemite network-popdown suddenly have a permanent Device entry <body> After the latest minor Mac OS-X upgrade to Yosemite, I discovered I suddenly have a new and permanent entry in my network-popdown menu, located under a "Device" heading named SETUP.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/begfc.png" alt="network-popdown menu"  It's permanent in the way that as long as Wi-Fi is on, it's visible with the same signal-strength - no matter where I bring the computer (also far away from mobile devices). I can connect the Mac to the SETUP node without problems...  Questions:  ol liWhat's that Device entry? /li liWhat's that SETUP node? - I guess it's something running on my Mac?/li liHow do I best scan the SETUP node, to learn more about it?/li /ol  <answer190835> strongWhat's that "Device" entry?/strong  The entries under codeDevice/code are wireless ad hoc networks, a type of wireless network that doesn't involve an access point or router, that is, a point-to-point wireless network, which usually connects two computers or a printer to a computer.  I couldn't find any Knowledge Base article at support.apple.com but theMacObserver has an excellent article about it.  strongWhat's that SETUP node? - I guess it's something running on my Mac?/strong  In your case, the ad hoc network is probably a printer nearby that is broadcasting its name. Another usual ad hoc network name is hpsetup, the default ad hoc network used by HP printers.  strongHow do I best scan the SETUP node, to learn more about it?/strong  You could connect to it and run code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s/code to get some information, but I don't think that's going to be of much use. You better go over to your neighbor's house and ask whether they have bought a printer lately.  strongHow can I create an ad hoc network?/strong  You can easily create an ad hoc network yourself:  ol liIn the Wi-Fi menu in the menu bar choose codeCreate Network.../code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEh1J.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liChoose a name (that's the name that will appear under codeDevice/code) and press kbdCreate/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9lh6.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThis is the new entry:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTBic.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you select codeDisconnect from &lt;network&gt;/code the ad hoc network is torn down./li /ol  <comment226591> Device is used for things like printers. Basically, anything that is identified as not being a router, is put under there. Don't know about the rest though.
