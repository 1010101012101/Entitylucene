Disable "Tags" prompt in OS 10.9 Save dialog <body> In Mavericks, the Save dialog now offers the ability to add Tags to the file you're saving:  img src="https://photos-5.dropbox.com/t/0/AABvyEC8iDGOH29HUlwng9GKxRETAZMUhT0MXTLkhedXgg/12/6228514/png/1024x768/3/1383156000/0/2/Screenshot%202013-10-30%2012.24.27.png/aZRj7qMBOOFYUPPt07RAH8nr4itzapvrB0GAUA2yOjE" alt=""  Supposing I want to remove this prompt, likely by running a shell command involving codedefaults write com.apple.finder/code. How do I do so?  <answer107638> When parsing all code.plist/code files in code~/Library/preferences/code. I don't find any options that would match your request.   If you want to try it yourself, here are the commands I used :   Convert all codeplist/code to xml text files (because some of them (are|can be) binary files)  :br / codefind . -name "*.plist" -exec plutil -convert xml1 "{}" \;/code  search the files for codetag/code: br / codegrep -rie "&lt;key&gt;.*tag.*&lt;/key&gt;" ./code  <comment126223> If it's somewhere it's not in `com.apple.finder.plist`. I didn't found a variable to change that. <comment126224> You're right. It doesn't seem to be in that particular file. But it seems like the sort of thing that Apple would expose somewhere. <comment126225> Yep I thought that too. I looked also in `.GlobalPreferences.plist`. There is nothing either. <comment126246> Well, that certainly makes it sound likely that it can't be disabled. I'll mark your answer as correct until someone proves otherwise.
