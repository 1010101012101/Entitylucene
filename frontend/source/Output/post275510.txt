Accessibility: Rotate part of the screen <body> I was hoping someone knows the utility/app, perhaps a macro that can help to rotate part of the screen.  Primarily I was looking in the Zoom option in Accessibility settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qs3Jn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Zoom Style: Picture-in-picture  Now the only setting I am missing is if I could strongchange the orientation of the preview Picture-in-picture/strong. It is unfortunate that Illustrator doesn't support 'Rotate Artboard' function (Like Photoshop do Rotate Canvas) hence the question.  Anyone?
