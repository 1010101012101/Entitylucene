List apps that are downloaded to my phone <body> How do I know what apps are downloaded to my iPhone 4?  <answer190267> Open Spotlight by pulling down on the home screen, then search for ".".br The first category is Applications, providing a list of applications that are installed.  <answer190281> Depending on which version of iOS you are using there is different ways to check that. If you are using a new version of iOS like 7 or 8 then you can do the following or something similar.  ol liOpen the "Settings" app./li liGo to General - Usage - Manage Storage (under Storage)./li liNow you should soon see a list of apps installed on your iPhone./li /ol  Remember that this is only applicable for newer versions of iOS. Also, between the versions the steps can differ a bit but it is similar. Check under "General" in Settings and look carefully for something like "Usage" or "Storage".  <comment225806> Please use tags relevant to the content of the question. For more information on tags, see [What are tags, and how should I use them?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/tagging) <comment225815> That does not work. At least not on iOS 8. <comment225816> @Dempa Works fine for me on iOS 8.3 on iPhone, iOS 8.2 on iPhone and iOS 7.1.3 on iPad. Make sure you're searching for just the character `.` and have Applications selected in Spotlight settings. <comment225818> I only see 9 of the applications and yes I have more than 9 apps installed (274). I am searching for just the 'dot' (.).
