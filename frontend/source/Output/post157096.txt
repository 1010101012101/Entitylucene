In Yosemite what does the indicator that looks like a scroll bar mean at the bottom of the desktop? <body> I've noticed that at the bottom of my desktop Yosemite has started displaying a strange sort of indicator - it looks like a horizontal scroll bar, it's a thin grey rectangle with rounded ends.  If I use large dock icons it overlaps with the dock itself, if I shrink the dock you can see that it is unrelated to the dock.  And no, it's not part of my wallpaper!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUOxE.png" alt="Mystery grey rectangular icon on Yosemite desktop"  <answer157163> It looks like a bug, not some sort of meaningful indicator as I first thought.  After quitting every application and restarting it's now gone away!  <comment184713> That is indeed the scroll bar. Do you have any applications that put a small window on your desktop? (For example, Bowtie places iTunes controls in a small window on the desktop.) <comment184731> Good suggestion but not that I can see - closed every application, menu item app, desktop widget and even flushed out some unused preference panes - still there. <comment184776> Have you upgraded to 10.10.1 ? <comment185174> Yes I have actually - only noticed it after the upgrade
