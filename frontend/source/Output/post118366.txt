Shorcut to pan in Preview? <body> Is there a shortcut (or the ability to assign one) to pan in Preview app?  It is quite troublesome to keep moving the mouse to and fro the scrollbars when we want to scroll.  <answer118386> In codePreview/code the arrow keys on the keyboard will scroll up, down, left and right when you have any document open. kbdcommand/kbd+ and kbdcommand/kbd- will zoom in and out.
