How do I share with different permissions from local host? <body> I want to create a user tvuser that has read access to a volume on my mac (Mountain Lion.)  NO one else has network read access.  At this point when I click sharing, enable AFP,  Everyone, and Staff have access -- the same permissions that have access locally.  If I change the permissions on the sharing tab, it changes the local permissions too.  How do I share something with more restrictive permissions?
