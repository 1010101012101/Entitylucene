Can I accept a call on iPhone without manual intervention? <body> I would like to know if I can accept a call without me or any person hitting the accept button?br It can happen immediately after receiving the call or after any number of rings, but automatic it should be.  <answer44792> There is an app called AutoAnswer, but it only works on jailbroken phones.  If you're into that sort of thing, you can find an article on it here:  http://www.ijailbreak.com/cydia/autoanswer-automatically-answer-specific-numbers-and-facetime-calls-on-your-iphone/  <comment50935> I don't believe this is possible <comment50939> Thanks for the answer AJ, but I am looking for an Apple approved app. <comment50942> Understood.  It is possible, but based on my searching only if you have a jailbroken phone.  Perhaps they'll add this feature to iOS at some point in the future.
