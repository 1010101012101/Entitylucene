How can I disable Photos on my iPad 2? <body> I want to disable photos icon in my iPad 2, but I don't know how to do that. I want to disable like Movies. I can disable Movies in General's Restriction, but I can't find how to disable Photos.br How can I do this?  <answer17232> There is no built-in support for disabling specific apps on iOS. However, there is a specific software for this (and costs $$$), but requires jailbreaking.  Currently the best way to jailbreak an iPad 2 is through JailbreakMe. It is really simple, just launch it in Safari and follow the steps.  After installing, launch Cydia. Navigate to the Cydia Store and purchase iProtect. After purchasing and activating it you should be able to "lock" your individual apps, such as the Photos application.  <comment18728> see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15138/is-it-possible-to-set-restrictions-on-any-ios-app/15150#15150 <comment18731> For free using SBSettings you can hide the icon. <comment18732> @mankoff: the OP wants the app disabled. <comment18733> Correct. If you can't launch it, isn't it disabled? You solution was for locking, not disabling, technically. <comment36767> Ditto what @user6124 said.
