Time Capsule: "There was a problem connecting to the server" <body> I have a dream:  The dream of using my MBP inside and outside my office, and having it backup to my 2TB Time Capsule when on its wireless network, or postpone backups when not on the Time Capsule's wireless network.  Unfortunately, if I've been on a different wireless network for a few hours worth of backup attempts, bringing the machine back onto the Time Capsule's wireless network doesn't clear up the problem.  I can select the disk as a backup drive in the Time Machine preferences, but the disk remains unavailable from the Finder, and any backup attempts yield the standard:     There was a problem connecting to the    server "Max Time Capsule"      Check the server name or IP address, and then try    again.  If you continue to have problems, contact your    system administrator.   My WiFi connection is through the same Time Capsule that hosts the backup drive, and its name and IP address have decidedly not changed.  The only thing that seems to help is restarting the Time Capsule, but that is an inconvenient workaround at best.  The problem sounds similar to Backup Disk Not Available, but the answers to that question are either to restart or change the disk name or turn off the 5 GHz network (which didn't help).  I also looked at /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeCapsule.plist, but found nothing that seemed relevant.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  My MBP is running OS X 10.7.5, and the Time Capsule firmware is 7.6.1.
