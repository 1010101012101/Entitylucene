How can I have AutoImport.app automatically import my iPhone photos (like it did in the past)? <body> In the past I connected my iPhone to my Macbook, and I had AutoImport.app automatically import (and delete) all my photo's on my iPhone in a chosen folder.br Somehow this workflow has stopped, and I don't manage to get it working again. Instead, now I have to manually let Image Capture do it (don't like it, to much hassle).br Mac OSX 10.11.6, iPhone 7.  <comment340613> Checked on El Cap & Sierra, the old location listed in http://digitalphotobuzz.com/auto-import-your-photos-on-a-mac is no longer present `/Library/Image Capture/Support/Application/` <comment340667> I still find it here: /System/Library/Image Capture/Support/Application isn't it the same location as it was? <comment340668> ach, my bad - they used a horrible method of listing the path; yup still there. <comment340890> On a side note - Image Capture is consistently erroring when importing from my camera cards since I upgraded to Sierra last week. It copies correctly but tells me it didn't. It then will not eject unless I drag it to the Trash in Finder. I'm going back to El Cap :/
