Set hours in week view in calendar <body> Is there any way to set hours I want to see in Week view in Calendar? I do not need hours marked with red ellipsis's and need only hours marked with blue rectangle.  If I try to resize window, then it compresses the whole view, i.e. everything becomes smaller and still shows hours I do not use... How can I make Calendar to show only specified hours in Week view, which is most convenient in my daily activities - need to see the whole week at once.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/htcav.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163042> Go to strongCalendar/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongGeneral/strong and set strongShow 24 hours at a time/strong to strong12/strong.  Additionally you can set strongDay starts at/strong to automatically scroll to given time.             img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJFrM.png" width="537"  <comment372717> This does not hide morning and night hours from the calendar.
