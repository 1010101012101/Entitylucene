Strange process on the port not listed in the ports taken by Apple docs <body> I've been checking ports taken by codelsof -i :8080/code and found strange records:  precodecom.apple 19149 famer   77u  IPv4 0x3ed748c5b0730dcb      0t0  TCP 10.1.32.158:60180-&gt;ec2-54-217-241-88.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:http-alt (CLOSE_WAIT) /code/pre  After some time process disappeared. This port is not listed in Apple TCP and UDP ports used  I'm really concerned about security now. How can I investigate what process is that and what information goes there?   <comment299554> See http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/105689/help-me-understand-this-adware-compute-1-amazonaws-com
