Edit track name of track without changing filename <body> If you edit Name of a file in iTunes, the filename changes too, not just the tag. Is there a way to avoid this? I want top preserve the original filename untouched when I edit Name. Is there a simple easy-to-install malware-less 3rd party tool for this?  <answer122328> It was easier than expected... within iTunes itself, in Preferencesâ†’Advanced, there is an option "Keep iTunes Media folder organised". Uncheck it and iTunes will leave the filenames as is.
