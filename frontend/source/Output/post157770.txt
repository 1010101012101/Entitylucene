Put only HD to sleep when possible, without putting SSD to sleep. Its possible? <body> Can I put only HD to sleep when possible, without putting SSD (inserted in superdrive slot) to sleep? (surfing on some forums I read that some problems may arise with SSD stop mode)  <comment185516> How do you put an SSD to sleep in the first place? There are no moving parts inside. <comment185517> not really an answer, but I have my drives set to sleep when possible & I haven't seen any ill-effects on my SSD. I don't know whether the system tries to sleep it or not, tbh. <comment185518> @patrix So you are saying me that I can put HD to sleep from Energy Saver Panel without any problem? <comment185519> Not really, I was more wondering what sleep means for a storage device without moving parts and not requiring electricity to maintain the stored data.
