The Mac portion is free, but you buy the iPad App.  Runs with Windows too.  Operates over WiFi, but you can always create a private network if one does not exist or it is too slow!    <answer2558> h2switchDiskSizeBase/h2  emIn Mac OS 10.6 disk and file sizes are measured in base 10 (one kilobyte is defined as 1000 bytes, one megabyte is defined as 1000 kilobytes, etc.) in Finder and Disk Utility.  Unfortunately this has created a lot of inconsistency even when working with Apple’s own programs since most of them still define file sizes in binary units (one kilobyte is defined as 1024 bytes, one megabyte is defined as 1024 kilobytes, etc.).  This utility will switch the measurement of disk and file sizes in both Finder and Disk Utility back to binary units (or if the measurement has already been switched to binary units it will restore the system back to using base 10 units)./em  After the switch in Snow Leopard I never could get used to read file sizes in Finder with base-10. This application patches the Foundation framework in order to get back base-2 units. I can now again compare disk space and file sizes with other operating systems or output from shell tools.  <answer3196> h2KeePassX password vault/h2  KeePassX is a cross platform secure password saver.

Like MacPorts and Fink, but simpler to use and easy to contribute to.  <answer3220> h2MenuMeters/h2  I have a hard time using a Mac without it these days.  How does anyone -- especially a programmer -- work without having the pulse of their Mac at their fingertips?  How else do you tell when your browser is stuck or is really downloading something, if you can't see the network traffic?  When the computer pauses, and you want to know if it's working, just look at the menu to see that the CPU gauges are pegged at 100% -- and much of that is in the kernel.  At a glance, I can instantly see that memory consumption has rocketed up, and with a click I can see that I'm heavily into swap space.  It's just so useful.  <answer3303> h2Acorn/h2  I have Photoshop, but Acorn is an amazing, lightweight and cheap alternative I go to way, way more often.  <answer3607> h2Coda/h2  Coda is the only web-language-text-editor I like. It does everything you really need for web applications. It remember some common part of code in clips that you can load just by typing their tag name, it completes your html tags, it shows you the list of functions with related variables and autocomplete, it has the powerful Transmit ftp engine built in, it has a great visual CSS editor, it allows you to personalize the text colors and it has HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP doumentation maulaus available from within the application.  Never seen all these features in just one application!  From the developer's website:   So, we code web sites by hand. And one day, it hit us: our web workflow was wonky. We’d have our text editor open, with Transmit open to save files to the server. We’d be previewing in Safari, adjusting SQL in a Terminal, using a CSS editor and reading references on the web. “This could be easier,” we declared. “And much cooler.”   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJl2k.jpg" alt="Screen Capture"  <answer3621> h2Mathematica/h2  If I need to choose only one software to install on my Mac, I would install emMathematica/em by Wolfram.  <answer3770> h2MPlayer OSX Extended/h2  It is a media player.

Did you know that some common applications such as Skype enable your high-powered Nvidia graphics card the entire time they're running?

Please, Steve, make iTunes optional   for iPods and iPads.   <answer4826> h2Opera/h2  Because it's still my favourite browser. After having used it on Windows for eight years, I took it with me when I "switched" four years ago.  Browsers are always subjective, but I like Opera because I rely on its single-key shortcuts, used its mouse gestures a lot before I moved over to a glass trackpad, I have dozens of tabs open at any time, it has session handling, bookmark syncing, and dozens of other neat, small things. And everything is built in and just works.  I could probably get Firefox to do everything Opera does for me, but it would be a hassle, and it would be even slower than it already is without any extensions. I could never get Safari to do everything I need.  <answer5247> h2Lastpass/h2  Yet another password manager (actually, probably the first one online, I believe prior to 1pass) that integrates well with every browser (well, at least Safari, Chrome and Firefox). You have even an option to use yubikeys with it. I use it for long time and it's just amazing. It does everything I would expect and little more. It monitors when you change password, have a KB of websites and really gets almost all of them, while allow you to configure whenever field with login and password you want. And it's multiplatform.  Back in 2010 it bought Xmarks and must integrate with that as well.  It's completely free to use but it does offer a premium subscription for extra (and unnecessary) features. I personally paid for it as a donation, since I really never use the features.  <answer6455> h2Garageband/h2  This program is, in some ways, the embarrassing bastard child of the audio world. It's an underpowered, feature-crippled version of Logic, one of the best-regarded multitracking applications in the recording world.   Nonetheless, Gagareband is very powerful, and does what I need it to do. While I'd appreciate more flexibility (tempo matching would be nice, and the ability to change time signatures within a project), and the program doesn't handle multiple layers of effects as well as I'd like, it performs brilliantly at what it does do, and it's insanely easy to learn.   Garageband is one of the main reasons strikeI haven't ditched my G5 Mac for a Windows or Linux machine/strike I took so long to replace my G5 mac.

I've seen this utility majorly improve the performance of Mac OS X.

A very useful and effective tool.  <answer7362> h1CrashPlan/h1  A very powerful backup application that allows you to backup to external drives, other computers, and/or their own cloud at a very reasonable price.

On many X-based desktops (such as KDE and Gnome) you can resize windows from any side, move windows by clicking anywhere on the window, and switch windows simply by pointing your mouse. Zooom/2 brings the same functionality to Mac, and I can no longer live without it. For example, in my configuration I hold Shift-⌘ and click anywhere in a window to move it. No more hunting for the menu bar or the resize corner!  <answer8384> h2Spirited Away/h2  Spirited Away checks each running application's activity, and if an application isn't active for a certain fixed time, Spirited Away hides the application automatically.

It's saved my data on more than one occasion from catastrophic hard drive failure.  From its website: SuperDuper is the wildly acclaimed program that makes recovery painless, because it makes creating a fully bootable backup painless. Its incredibly clear, friendly interface is understandable, easy to use, and SuperDuper's built-in scheduler makes it trivial to back up automatically.

Plugging in my DVD player to my Mac is quick and easy, though!)  <answer10128> h2TinyUmbrella/h2  TinyUmbrella is a great app for anyone who has an iOS device they want to downgrade to a previous firmware for one reason or other.

Includes numerous effects like Equalizer, Reverb, Time Stretch, Pitch Shift, Echo. Moreover, all supported files can be exported to AAC+, Apple Lossless, WAV and other formats with enabled effects.   This is one truly awesome little app which is sadly not well-known. I'd even say Vox was one of the reasons I switched to Mac. Nothing but the essentials for a music player. Besides, it offers some nice audio features (e. g. resampling with antialiasing) as well as built-in Last.fm integration and nifty controls in menubar.  I prefer to organize my music in folders by artists and albums and not bother with music libraries used in most modern audio players, so Vox's ability to play all files in a folder is the single most important feature to me.  If you feel that iTunes has grown far too big for a music player or just don't like messing with audio libraries you should really give Vox a try.  <answer14972> h2Pianopub/h2     Pianopub is a free Pandora internet radio player for OS X.

It is tremendously flexible and customizable in letting you design your own way to organize application launchers.  Let me be frank; I've been using a Mac every day since 1987. I cannot live without DragThing because I could never get used to using the Dock, which appeared with the first Mac OS X circa 2000 (and I was using developer builds of Mac OS X before the first version went public). While you can configure DragThing to perform many functions, what I use it for is to provide an application menu and an application launcher that behave the same way they did in Apple Macintosh System 7 through Mac OS 9. That's the way I want it.  <answer21979> h2Fantastical/h2  Amazing background app for quickly accessing and adding events to your mac's calendar.

It's a bit like a more single-minded Dashboard for your desktop. You can make awesome clocks, or beautiful server monitoring, or just a fortune cookie (if you install fortune with HomeBrew).  It's not perfect (it would need sticky borders, continuous command output and sane multi-monitor behavior for that) but it's a lot of fun, using little resources.  <answer24246> h2Prism by Mozilla Labs/h2  Prism allows you to turn strongany/strong webpage into an application.

Trigger a macro based on a hotkey (overriding the frontmost app if appropriate), typed strings (a la TextExpander, the status of an app, the system waking or your logging in, at certain times or dates, etc.   A macro can do pretty much anything you can do manually -- manage apps, choose menu items, click on windows or dialog boxes or whatever, display text or Growl or other notifications, etc. -- including running scripts. Macros can also include flow control (if, while, etc.) for less straightforward tasks (e.g. in Photoshop kbdCmd/kbdkbdDelete/kbd deletes the current layer if a layer is selected or the current group of layers if a group is selected).  One great use is unifying commands across apps, e.g. have kbdCmd/kbdkbd-/kbd zoom out and kbdCmd/kbdkbd=/kbd zoom in for every app that supports the concept rather than having to remember how, say, OmniGraffle does it vs Photoshop vs Numbers.     Keyboard Maestro enables you to create or record custom macro shortcuts that you can activate at any time. For example, your macros could help you navigate runnings applications or work with an unlimited number of clipboards. Best of all, every macro you create is available using simple keystrokes you choose.   <answer27452> h20xED/h2  a free, native OS X hex editor based on the Cocoa framework.  ul liFast editing of large files./li liUnlimited file size (limited by what the actual file system supports)./li liSmall memory footprint./li liInstant opening of files of any size./li liResource fork editing./li liFull hex/text search/replace. /li liBinary/text Cut/copy/paste support./li liPlug-in system to display your custom data types./li /ul  <answer27462> h2Adobe Creative Suite / Master Collection/h2  The absolute strongKING/strong of creative tools.

It allows your computer to determine its context through gathering evidence from your environment (evidence sources), using flexible rule-based fuzzy matching to make an educated guess (rules), and then performing arbitrary actions upon changing context (actions).

Using evidence sources you   can create a set of rules that tell ControlPlane what context to apply   to your environment.  When ControlPlane enters or leaves a context a   set of Actions are performed.   In other words: it will turn off screen saver protection when You arrive home and turn it back when You leave.

This little free System Preference gets installed on two computers, and then you can move your cursor off the screen of one, onto the screen of the other.  I run a dedicated Mac Mini server, but my main computer is a Mac Pro. I have the server screen above the pro screen, and I can simply move my cursor up to the server, like you'd do with multiple monitors on the same computer. BRILLIANT!

Currently in beta, but it does an awesome job of piping all your Growl notifications into the Notification Center of OS X Mountain Lion. The only real downside to it is that it flags all notifications with the Growl icon.  <answer59833> h2Herald/h2  Allow notification plugin for Mail.app. In ML you have notification center, but with Herald you also get the full message body which I really like.   <answer59898> h2Little Ipsum/h2  It’s my favorite dummy text / emlorem ipsum/em generator for OS X (free).

In this way you don't have to pay for more space, if you have your own server, and you don't have to share data with no one else (service provided) except the people you decide.  strongHow does it work?/strong     SparkleShare creates a special folder on your computer in which   projects are kept. All projects are automatically synced to their   respective hosts (you can have multiple projects connected to   different hosts) and to your team's SparkleShare folders when someone   adds, removes or edits a file.   strongWhy SparkleShare?/strong     The idea of SparkleShare sprouted at the GNOME Usability Hackfest in   London, where a couple of designers came to the conclusion that they   didn't have a good (Open Source) collaboration tool to share their   work (for more background, read “The one where the designers ask for a   pony”). They didn't like how the good collaboration tools were   proprietary, and that using them meant having to give up privacy,   control and other rights. What they needed was something that they   could run and control themselves, without having to depend on other   companies.   <answer68362> h2SafeWallet/h2  SafeWallet is a very useful and complete password manager, which allows you to safely keep you passwords, credit card pins, notes, and many more stored on your Mac.

Bark intelligently brings notifications from Growl into Notification Center under OS X Mountain Lion. /code/pre  Much like Hiss, Bark forwards your Growl notifications to Notification Center in Mountain Lion. The catch though is it forwards them not as "Growl Notifications", but as notifications from the actual app that sent them, making the experience totally seamless.  Screenshots might make it more clear. I reckon Bowtie and Coda 2 don't support Notification Center natively, but with Bark this is what you get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MbSi9.png" alt="Bowtie through Bark" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k3uIU.png" alt="Coda 2 through Bark"  And on notification center they look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDiHT.png" alt="Bowtie / Coda 2 in Notification Center"  Correct icons, correct grouping, the plugin is completely free and works with the newer versions of Growl (App Store versions)... definitely worth checking out!  emPS: Coda 2.0.3 I think now supports Notification Center natively, but you get the idea.../em  <answer70992> h1ControlPlane (free/open-source)/h1  This application can strongtrigger a wide range on actions based on different events/strong, its mainly use being to start/stop application based on your context.

There are (community defined) "good" applications that are useful on a daily basis. <comment36> @Josh K — true, but it's a StackExchange policy not to allow them — as you see, [subjective] is now disallowed as a tag across SO-family websites due to the consensus being that the questions only add clutter to the Q&A site. <comment39> @Josh K: I disagree... I think that questions should always be able to be "answered".  I realize that many questions can have multiple right answers, but when a question is this subjective, every single answer from ever single user could theoretically be correct. <comment40> @calavera: You must concede that it is not always the case. Simply because there are many "theoretically" correct answers does not preclude it from being good question. We want good questions. <comment47> This discussion should be continued on meta, but I think it is the _subjective_ tag that was banned, not subjective questions.  The feeling was that the tag didn't add anything. <comment53> Voted to reopen - it is subjective, but a popular and useful style of question, if kept as a wiki and not repeated too much. These questions are mostly accepted on gadgets.stackexhange.com for example. <comment242> what quicksilver does? <comment244> Quicksilver is an intuitive, self learning, application launcher and system manipulator. Best I can phrase it. <comment247> The problem with subjective questions is they lose relevance much more readily. The answer to a specific problem generally remains the same as the days go on. The answers to a subjective question such as this generally become less relevant in the face of time. A new user coming across an un-pruned thread may be lead astray because a once revered piece of software has fallen in disgrace or otherwise been supplanted by a superior tool, but the only way they would know this is if they read all X number of pages to the thread. <comment256> Can we make this Community Wiki?

Press Shift-Cmd-D (or select View Sidebar from View menu). Now drag another PDF file (from Finder, Desktop etc) onto the PDF file you can see in the sidebar (drop your 2nd doc on top of the 1st, not into blank area of sidebar). Preview will join the documents together (you can revert, or save, save as, etc). All of the pdf stuff seems to be driven through the sidebar. Let me know if you get it, otherwise I'll try make a little online tutorial. :-) <comment322> TextMate 2.0 is the new Duke Nukem Forever ;-) <comment329> That's brilliant! No longer do I have to wait for bloated Acrobat to open do merge documents.  My issue was I opened both PDFs up at once, which stuck them both in the sidebar as separate PDFs, and wouldn't let me do it. Trick is to just open the one, and then do the dragging.

Open permanently and the main reason I moved from PC's - a decent unix access point. <comment394> http://osx.iusethis.com/ <comment412> For similar options, also look at Google Quick Search Box. Apple's Spotlight now has many of the more interesting Quicksilver features as well. <comment414> awesome! I didn't know either about the merging. Why would they hide it that much? <comment416> if spotlight would appear in the middle of my screen, I'd be almost happy, but Quicksilver is still way much better for launching apps <comment431> @pablo if you really can't live without it, maybe you should put more time in specifying why, no? <comment463> Why downvoted? If you *can* live without Eclipse, perhaps just abstain from upvoting this? <comment466> Firefox and Mac OS X just don't mix :( Safari also has add-ons :) <comment467> I think iWork pwns :) <comment505> I use Jing for that as it can be used for screencasts up to 5 minutes as well and not only pics :) <comment506> I never liked the app :( I installed http://www.phpmyadmin.net and use it from localhost. <comment516> +1 just because I don't get the down votes. I don't particularly enjoy using MS Office, but there are some things it does really well when you get MS Office documents from others. If you're an academic, a lawyer, a project manager, or a sales person, it is a pretty useful piece of software. <comment533> @John: Quicksilver is still faster (on all machines I've tried) then Spotlight. <comment534> +1, Transmission rocks. For those with servers there is even a slick web-ui. <comment554> Transmit 4 is awesome. I used Cyberduck for a long time, but I recently checked out Transmit 4 and was quite impressed. <comment557> Probably also the most expensive. <comment598> @muddybulldog, what makes you think this would be "un-pruned"? A poll like this can very much be dynamic and "alive", because we have 1) the voting system, 2) ability to edit posts, and 3) possibility to add new answers when new great apps appear! <comment619> Just like quicksilver .) <comment642> Some things still put Firefox above competition: intelligent (learning) address bar autocomplete; huge selection of *good* add-ons (Safari or Chrome don't even come close). Too bad Firefox is slower than Chrome... <comment643> Though some Firefox features still aren't matched in Chrome, I nowadays find myself mostly using Chrome on OS X because it's just so much faster. <comment647> iTerm is even better. <comment648> At work I have use Word, however I write my text in Pages and then export to Word. Pages is a well crafted product. <comment649> Awesome when combined with MacFusion. <comment657> academics use TeX (pronounced 'tech' please! :D) <comment658> “I’m inclined to encourage users to move over to the more stable and well supported alternatives like LaunchBar” – [Nicholas Jitkoff, Developer of Quicksilver](http://lifehacker.com/software/exclusive-lifehacker-interview/quicksilvers-creator-on-the-future-of-qs-330548.php) <comment659> @Carmine: I say no to LB. Quicksilver is free, and *does much more*. Besides, where's the fun without a little application instability? <comment704> Maybe they hate Eclipse as much as me. <comment714> The CMD T shortcut would be hard for me to live without. <comment720> What about iTerm2 ? <comment729> This is also similar to xScope by IconFactory, with Rulers being comparatively lightweight. <comment731> Good to know. Thanks. I use rulers quite often. <comment741> +100 I can't even remember my password now <comment746> I prefer xScope, though I hadn't heard about rulers. <comment748> praise spaghetti monster... finally an alternative to that pile of un-userfriendly crapola that is vlc! <comment749> anyone know of a Free or Open Source alternative to textexpander? <comment766> You get what you pay for. <comment768> +1 because even though I think Office as a whole is an absolute beast of bloatware, Excel has a place in a lot of my processes. Numbers tries a little *too* hard to be different, I think. <comment771> Really nice one. Can even play rmvb files ! <comment781> +1 use it more than all other apps combined. <comment842> @jonik: Even I have seen the light, this thread rocks :) <comment869> I prefer Helvetireader (with fluid), but I think both will be trumped by the upcoming Reeder for Mac... <comment966> Skitch is the reason I switched from Windows to Mac over a year ago (although I continue to be unsure if I'm happy about the switch or not.) <comment991> I much prefer MAMP. <comment996> Cut is just select text <comment1009> Especially as it is the only solution to virtualize Mac OS X (although restricted to Mac hardware only). <comment1017> It's a great application to present slides in PDF format. Preview.app always has this irritating overlay you can't disable. <comment1019> No offense anyone, but I do find it somewhat strange and hilarious that in the Mac world there are commercial applications for something as trivial as *renaming files* (or [deleting them](http://superuser.com/questions/10676/permanently-deleting-files-on-mac-os))... <comment1020> Windows have programs too for mass renaming. A free alternative to A Better Finder Rename is the program: NameChanger, it's not that advanced, but it's something. <comment1099> Vuze is better :) <comment1138> There's now a question on meta dealing with this: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90/list-of-x-poll-style-questions-what-to-do <comment1140> I use [InsomniaX](http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/22211/insomniax) - any idea how it compares to Caffeine? <comment1142> transmission is better :) <comment1160> This application has saved me several times while taking college courses.  Apparently the college I attend thinks Microsoft products are the only products available. <comment1203> I remember how much I hated preview back in 10.4 days! Now, thanks to the fact that Quicklook took over some of his duties, I love it :) <comment1263> I was used to Launchy from Windows world, and found Quicksilver. But after few days, I found that Spotlight works just fine for me and I never use Quicksilver. It was also pretty hard to find shortcut that didn't collide with some other program that I use. <comment1266> QuickSilver is much more then simply an application launcher. ;) <comment1268> Not just Mac though. <comment1289> Been playing with this a lot and I really love it.  I was beginning to think that I would be stuck with the cruel joke that is VLC forever.  This app beats the crap out of VLC for ease of use.  It even seems less buggy.  I can play the same file in both apps and VLC skips and does all kinds of weird crap while Movist just plays the file perfectly. <comment1293> Also worth noting... you can annotate pdfs using Preview. This is useful for all sorts of things; adding simple shapes to highlight/emphasize things, adding (colored) text for note-taking, etc. <comment1294> I really can't stand VLC.  Buggy, extremely difficult to configure, ugly as hades... the only thing it has going for it is the sheer number of different formats it will play.  Why should I have to be an expert in video and audio codecs to configure my player?  Movist beats this one by far. <comment1295> Can't believe this one wasn't mentioned already.  This is indispensable to me with all the crap I put my Macs through :) <comment1301> Spiritual successor or actual successor? It seems like it was inspired by THL, not coded by the same guy. <comment1365> Buy the 'PowerPack' for this - it adds even more functionality. Alfred is a really nice little utility - replaced QuickSilver for me. <comment1373> I can't believe this hasn't been voted higher. <comment1387> I love Pages to make beautiful cards! You can't beat the simple yet effective layouting that's possible with this software. <comment1388> +1 I think this app is awesome. Much better than the MySQL GUI Tools. Prefer it over phpMyAdmin any day. <comment1390> VMWare Fusion is great! I can share my VMs with VMWare Player for Windows and Fusion can even boot my Bootcamp installation as a VM. <comment1391> +1, it's a very useful utility. Though my iMac 27" is so big that I rarely use it :-) <comment1400> open-source and great <comment1401> Fusion's strength is definitely compatibility with it's bigger siblings (ie, Server-class).  I can play around with an appliance, configure and demo it, then migrate the image straight to our server fabric if it fits our usage patterns.  Amazing for small companies or departments. <comment1402> Amazing for some (not for me). <comment1403> Technically just a utility, but I love it so much. <comment1404> videomonkey.org didn't resolve for me.  I did find their sourceforge page however: http://videomonkey.sourceforge.net/Video_Monkey/News/News.html <comment1439> honestly i got really frustrated with cyberduck due to little but important details (for example your bookmarks aren't sortable, no sidebyside view local/remote, ...) and switched to Transmit. Haven't looked back since ... <comment1441> I've never had luck with VLC. It is constantly crashing, and terribly buggy. Seconding Movist a hundred times. <comment1931> @Moshe: Sure, many of the apps mentioned (VLC, Chrome, Skype, Evernote, ...) aren't *only* available for Mac. That doesn't matter. <comment1935> "The Unarchiver" does this in the GUI and can be set as your default so it acts like the native OS X archive utility. <comment1937> Both Apache and PHP are preinstalled with Mac OS, and installing MySQL is a double-click away. <comment1942> It's a great IDE, and it's FREE. <comment1961> As an aside, bettertouchtool now has the same functionality, so if you're using both you can save a little bit of resources. <comment2040> I used Quicksilver for a long time, but I think Launchbar has the edge at this point. <comment2079> I use this pretty much constantly for archiving my CD collection to lossless FLAC and then later into mp3.  It's better than EAC (Windows only) in my opinion.  Easier to set up, faster, and far less buggy. <comment2207> You should add some description of what Hub List does. <comment2208> Seems interesting (if a bit pricey). Consider adding to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1286/great-ipad-apps too. <comment2861> Never understood why I should use an app to do what Spotlight already does. I understand people using Quicksilver from before Spotlight existed, but I don't see any reason to switch for new users. Is there one? <comment2868> At first i loved it, but from time to time SFTP synchronization fails with "nothing to do" even when there are modified files. <comment2885> I like it for browsing the repository (logs, blame, etc).  I tend to use the command line for commits & updates, though.  Faster & easier.  Maybe some day they'll implement my request to search through the "blame" window or display more than one line in logs... <comment2886> Not just emacs, but emacs that feels like a Mac app -- at least, as much as you want it to.  (Very configurable.) <comment2887> Merging - oh, nice!  And here I was just a java program ("PDFSAM" for "PDF Split And Merge") for that! <comment2888> I use PasswordWallet for the same thing, but either seems crucial. <comment2889> I've never really understood these.  When do you want this? <comment2890> I can't say enough good things about OmniGraffle. <comment2898> This will be really great when the iron out the bugs. <comment3314> before firefox4 i had moved almost completely to chrome, but yay for ff4 (esp. tab grouping) <comment3316> @khedron: it's useful for long-running unattended tasks e.g. download program, compiler, video encoding, some long computation, ... anything that doesn't require interaction but takes long enough time that your Mac would sleep otherwise. <comment3317> Really great tool! <comment3318> @Jonik: it's not about simple rename, but mass rename of many files :-) On Windows I use built-in tool in Total Commander for this. <comment3321> @Peter: Of course it's about mass rename; I still find it odd and funny, especially the price tag. (NB: my background is in the Unix world, where powerful command-line has always existed and people generally are adept at it, which might partly explain my reaction :-) <comment3333> @khedron I got Caffeine so that I could watch videos on my computer without the screen dimming. I had had enough of wiggling the mouse every few minutes. <comment3341> Personally I think Excel is more powerful than Numbers, or at least the power is not hidden. <comment3342> Firefox is sssllllooowww. <comment3346> Beats MacPorts and Fink right out the water! <comment3384> I love homebrew. Much better than MacPorts. Uses existing libraries that come with OS X to cut down compile times. <comment3450> @Josh K - Apples and Oranges. <comment3524> [Quote of the day](https://twitter.com/Tisca/status/29304574565): "I just ditched Firefox for Chrome. I feel like I just left my wife and kids for a 19 year old cheerleader." <comment3918> Soon to be not so missing when the Mac app store comes out... :-P <comment3921> Evernote is amazing. +10 <comment3923> @Ricket: I think those are orthogonal. Homebrew is for CLI Open Source programs. <comment3958> If you have an ebook reader, this app is pretty much essential. <comment3990> @khedron: Disagreed. It's the easiest diagramming application that I use. I *can* use Illustrator to draw diagrams, but OmniGraffle decreases the amount of time I need to do this, *and* has minimal quality loss. <comment3991> :( Unfortunately not available outside of European countries. <comment3992> @robsoft I'd *love* to buy the PowerPack to support Alfred, but I'm afraid that if I do this, it'll get too complicated. (File control, iTunes, ...) I like Alfred the way it is right now. <comment3993> @JFW: Yeah. Wikipedia notes, however, that according to the company, "Spotify will be launched in the United States before the end of 2010" <comment4024> this is absolutely essential for me <comment4094> @JFW: I think there was a parsing problem somewhere -- I think OmniGraffle is fantastic.  Maybe do a search on "can't say enough good things" to see how I was using this? <comment4268> + Yahoo Messenger, AIM and iChat don't support Voice/Video chat with Windows clients. For me, the only choice for Video/Voice is Skype. <comment4269> I'd prefer to do these things in Terminal. Also Automator is really helpful! <comment4287> +1 from another who vastly prefers it to phpmyadmin. <comment4299> I tried using it for UML stuff and found it really lacking and difficult to use <comment4303> @joshdick: I use [Jiggler](http://www.sticksoftware.com/software/Jiggler.html) for that. <comment4304> @willcodejava: Can you explain more where you found it lacking? <comment4307> Sadly, Beta 5 is as awful as a UI can get. <comment4308> Now supporting CUT-Paste for files! :) <comment4309> Although I’m a VMware and Parallels user, Parallels has the tendency to charge you 49€/year for the “50% faster” newer versions. At the rate Parallels has advertised the speed increase, the virtualized version should be faster than native these days… <comment4310> @calavera rather than better I’d say transmission is lighter (by far) ;) (note: I use transmission) <comment4311> @Josk K - Sure. I used it straight out of the box. It seemed really clumsy the way you had to choose the right class type, one was just for name, different one for operations, and then one with name, operations and attributes. The connections were also little lines that you had to manually select with the boxes and very difficult to attach correctly. <comment4360> As a programmer I cannot live without this! <comment4362> I don't understand why this wasn't upvoted more, Coda is **so awesome!** <comment4363> I thought Mac OS X itself had everything I needed to keep my Mac clean and healthy... <comment4364> Yep it is, freaking awesome. <comment4382> Clean My Mac clears cache files, broken links and also it has an uninstaller to remove applications completely. <comment4438> Visor is a great addition--a keystroke slides your terminal in from the top of the screen. <comment4440> Blech. I bailed out of Eclipse in favor of TextMate in my last project. <comment4441> Best powerpack feature: clipboard history. I can now "copy up" three things, then paste them back out in whatever order I like. Brillig! <comment4685> I actually really like iTunes in Mac OSX. The Windows version, not so much; but Mediamonkey (a Windows-only app) can manage music on iPods and iPads, and multiple Linux apps can also manage them. <comment4839> One thing Things is desperately missing is proper cloud sync. (Current wifi sync is kinda ok, but it doesn't let you use Things on many computers, for example.) Cultured Code says [it's in the works](http://culturedcode.com/status/), but then they've said that for 1-2 years and nothing seems to be happening. :/ I've used Things for a long time and I like it a lot, but lack of this feature, and of [communication](http://culturedcode.com/things/blog/), makes me consider switching to Evernote or something. <comment5328> I like both, but I'm using mplayer more nowadays. It is great! <comment5329> you really should consider lastpass. I abandoned my keepassX. <comment5337> I actually got used to not have everything maximized, unlike when I was a maximizor freak on windows, once I started using OSX. but nice app! :P <comment5338> It would be awesome if not so buggy and heavy. <comment5340> I find it surprising dropbox comes up first... This would never happen with a "Windows Programs you can't live without" in a windows community. <comment5341> I always loved VLC... but try MPlayer guys. It's listed here already and it's awesome! <comment5343> Is there a way to "search prior to posting" through all pages at once? - nevermind just found a way: **searching on the question feed**!  :) <comment5346> CyberDuck even supports Amazon S3 (cloud storage). <comment6569> Evernote is now available on the [Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/fi/app/evernote/id406056744?mt=12). (Which, by the way, has resulted in a [huge influx](http://blog.evernote.com/2011/01/07/mac-app-store-more-than-doubles-new-users/) of new users.) <comment6714> what about homebrew and fink? <comment6715> Yeah, the spotify launch in the US has been just months away for over a year... <comment6716> Looks awesome - you should maybe mention that it costs $100. <comment6791> Awesomeness cost <comment6879> @Carmine That's quite an assumption you make there. I'm an academic and enjoy using TeX myself, but the majority of my colleagues are very uncomfortable with it, both in concept and in practice. <comment6881> This is an exemplary community wiki. Thanks to everyone involved. <comment6899> Great because if you use it on your iPhone or iPad it will also sync read tweets in your timeline. <comment6900> I like LastPass a lot, I just wish it had a more polished UI like 1Password. <comment6904> After switching to chrome a while ago, I've noticed it still has trouble with two things:  CPU usage with HD flash video, and ASP driven interfaces (and other Microsoft languages). <comment6918> Excel is hugely more powerful (Pivot tables for a start), but it, and it's output, is nowhere near as pretty as Numbers. <comment6919> Evernote *looks like* such a good alternative, but it doesn't seem to have specific To Do functions and the iPhone version is a bit Fisher Price. Things does exactly what it says it does, reliably and professionally, but cloud sync is waaaaay overdue. <comment6969> @JBRW: Agreed. Now that I've started using Evernote too, I'd say it's great, but not really a Things replacement for me. <comment7524> DTerm does not require SIMBL like Visor does. It's great. <comment7846> I also recently discovered the GUI port of vim for the Mac, and I must say I really love editing C and C++ code in it. It also helps to better edit makefiles, since Xcode hasn't really got any support for makefiles. I only write Objective-C code in my Xcode editor, since Xcode has phenomenal text completion for Cocoa and the vim editor lacks this. <comment7849> Yeah, definitely not a fan. Very un-Mac-like. <comment7850> You need to give a better explanation of what benefit it gives to users. The only thing you've told them is that it is "cross-platform", not very useful at all. <comment7855> May be good if you're a mac user trying to become an emacs user, but not good if you're an emacs user new to a mac. Use native Emacs built for mac instead. <comment7882> @Cawas: i added another way to search the answers into the question.  It involves using `inquestion:this` in the search field. <comment7906> @Doug - I agree, Cocoa Emacs is a much better way to go. Even if you're a Emacs noob, you shouldn't really get a non-emacs Emacs, it defeats the purpose of learning a cross platform editor. <comment7907> @Studer - iTerm2 is about the most excellent Terminal I've ever used. (except perhaps GLTerminal ;) ) <comment7908> iTerm 2 kicks it's ass (not from the same developer) <comment7909> Sorry, "can't say any good things" about OmniGraffle. <comment7910> @fardjad - +1 for using the Terminal / Automator. <comment7912> The Unarchiver team also provide a command line utility `urar` that uses the same compression library, so you can extract all those obscure formats from a script. <comment7948> @calavera woot! (I think) I wish I could just add features like that. :D <comment7968> Kod looks interesting, but it is nowhere near powerful enough for me to switch from TM at present. <comment7976> @Carmine, comparing \TeX to Word is not fair to either. <comment7977> It's getting there! <comment8037> The only thing missing is more shortcuts like a shortcut to move files around in the dual pane mode <comment8311> @Calavera `inquestion:this` search is **case sensitive**. for example try this, `inquestion:this iterm`, you won't get any results, but if you try `inquestion:this iTerm` you will find one entry. Is this expected behavior or can I create a Bug/ Feature req on Meta ? <comment8346> @garikapat: i would create a bug on meta... feel free to edit the question with a note about this as well <comment8373> Never configured anything on VLC, it works for me out of the box, with flv, wmv, mkv, mp4, avi, mov, mpeg. Unexpected crashes do happen, you have to deal with it, but other than that, it's great. <comment8948> I think it may be important to mention that this is probably not a good idea for new unibody Macbook Pros since the keyboard is one of the primary ways that cool air is pulled into the laptop (the MBP only has one external vent slit for pushing air out in the back). <comment9019> I would recommend Homebrew over MacPorts by a long way. https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew <comment9305> +1, and I'll add nvALT, a fork of Notational Velocity that adds support for Markdown, Textile and MultiMarkdown in Preview and a bunch more: http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/ <comment9307> I finally sprung for it and couldn't be happier. It works *really* well with my Mac and with my WinXP computer. Definitely got my money's worth. <comment9461> And it is much cheaper than MS Office! <comment9492> It's ⌃-click, not ⌘-click. <comment9863> My best friend. <comment9900> @Daniel, probably my view are biased since I come from Computer Science, but I rarely saw papers that didn't look like they were written using TeX. In my department it's recommended for every academic writing. <comment10313> +1 if you don't want to fork over the cash for BBEdit, TextWrangler is a fantastic alternative, with all of the basic (yet extremely powerful) text editing tools you'll need. <comment10516> You can always click Shift + maximize button (green button) and you'll get the same functionality. For free... <comment10591> I think that through Home Sharing, you may only stream iTunes compatible videos. So Air Video Server is still needed for all other video formats! <comment10602> @Warren P: Well, Xcode 4 isn’t free. <comment10924> @Mathias Well.. They say that if you pay up the developer's licence it is? (not that I would call that free, but still) <comment12014> Use MplayerX for Mac, it's free on Mac App Store. Although i prefer the command line version mplayer <comment12021> I prefer KomodoEdit. Free and better than BBEdit. I used BBEdit for maybe ten years and swore by it, but then I started using Komodo and never looked back. <comment12194> I like JustLooking (http://chipmunkninja.com/JustLooking).  Navigates more easily through a directory of files, and actually shows animations! <comment12195> Quicksilver has some scripts built into it--it's more than just a Search tool, from what I recall.  I think there were some iTunes plugins, and other application extensions.  Where Spotlight is great for searching and launching files/applications (what I use it for), Quicksilver can do more automations I believe. <comment12196> Can't handle everything I've thrown at it (sometimes chokes on password protected zips/rars, or split rars that may have been created on Windows(?), but I have a few backups in case.  This is my default archive extract utility. <comment12199> BBEdit is great for web development, but not so great for development in non-web languages.  (Case in point: syntax highlighting.) <comment12200> KeepassX is an ugly non-native app.  Its only redeeming quality is that it is cross-platform. <comment12211> yep, MacFusion is must have. <comment12212> I use FZ too and I like it. I have experienced that Cyberduck and Transmit is having difficulties uploading lots of files via FTP. Then I found Filezilla which has uploaded everything I have thrown at it. <comment12213> Thunderbird works great with imap to my gmail account. Microsoft Entourage is somewhat buggy with imap and crashes all the time. Apple Mail is incredibly slow with imap. Thankfully there is Thunderbird. Besides Thunderbird has plugins similar to Firefox. <comment12220> @titaniumdecoy say what? it has built-in syntax highlighting for *dozens* of languages. Down in the bottom left of every window, there's a thing that says "(none)". click that to show a popup menu of all the built-in languages. you can add even more via plugins. i've been using it for bash and ruby scripting all week, and the syntax highlighting has been just fine. <comment12222> Transmit wins by a long shot regarding UI, but Filezilla works every time :) <comment12245> This is such an integrated part of my daily workflow. The previews are just eye candy. The shortcuts on dock items, and the resizing of windows are slick and extremely efficient. <comment12246> Kod is more powerful, just not enough add-on's / plugins. More importantly it's too buggy at the time (v0.0.3). That with the huge development slow-down , it isn't looking good. A lot like TM2 :0 <comment12249> Seriously, this is the first app I install on any fresh system, it's that useful. A 'must have' app. <comment12250> Yep, this is an app of the highest quality. Another 'must have'. <comment12251> Awesome lil' app. <comment12264> The last version I used was BBEdit 8.5 (maybe it's changed in version 9) but in my experience there are only 3 syntax highlights for non-HTML languages: keywords, text, and numbers. <comment12764> The Dev tools in Safari (some say the same) are just not there yet so I stick with Chrome for Dev. If Apple update Safari in the next release then we will see. <comment12765> Little to slow for me. Look forward to future releases. <comment12766> I keep going for Visor to Window and have now stuck with Visor. Great App. <comment12780> It doesn't suck. <comment12846> Agree with Petruza, I've installed VLC on OSX multiple times, zero problems. <comment13377> Forget terminal + visor. iTerm 2 offers visor plus much much more... Switched to few weeks ago, will never go back. <comment13378> I love things but switched to omnifocus for its syncing features <comment13379> Parallels is much better than vmware. Bought both, only using vmware when I need to share vms with windows users. <comment13380> I agree that iTunes is a ***** and I hate like most people the fact that we have no other choice. But that's still a great syncing tool for music and backuping devices. I doubt any alternatives offer that features for free. <comment13381> Eclipse has always sucked. I used it since first version. There are so much better alternatives. Look at intellij for java, you will regret the time you wasted on eclipse. <comment13382> "slowly" is the word. :) look at macvim/vim for a serious all purpose text editor. I left textmate for it a while ago. <comment13935> Sparrow has replaced Mailplane for me, for one reason: super-fast account switching. The UI is ok. Still needs some usability polish. <comment13996> It is Duplicate! <comment14022> Whoa. I really think I **could** *live without* this application. :-D though the read out loud option may be useful to someone. <comment14636> @Jonik Yes, the intelligent awesome bar is excellent. I switched to Chrome and really miss being able to type in some arbitrary parts of the URL in order to find a page in my history. <comment14660> Eclipse is a fine example of a product designed by committee. It tries to do everything, only to fail miserably at all of them. <comment14672> Although it *still* doesn't support drag-and-drop, which is incredibly frustrating. I usually end up using the now-unsupported VisualHub. <comment16064> They could do without the ugly anchor animation. <comment16067> @CarlosZ Thank you! I knew there was a way to do it but I forgot. But I'm like @Cawas at this point: I rarely maximize anymore after switching from Windows (where it seems like everyone maximizes). <comment16068> Also note that DTerm is now in the Mac App Store. <comment16139> This application is no longer developed. The original app, `Smultron`, which was abandonned, is now developed again (and available on the App Store). So Fraise developer said there would be no other update to Fraise. <comment16197> Yeah I'm the same @styfle but it is still useful sometimes <comment16486> Ugh, I can not express to you how much I loath Growl. It's even worse that tons of apps (like Dropbox) install it silently without asking, or simply crash and burn (like Max) if it isn't installed without giving you any error messages or means of troubleshooting. <comment16487> Giving this a down-vote because there's an answer about Homebrew and I want it bubbled up to the top. If others think the same, please up- and down-vote accordingly. <comment16488> Also now available on the iPhone 4 as well. Very handy. <comment16489> 1Password is cross platform as well, and MUCH more popular. <comment16490> Maybe Apple will transition the iOS App Store into the App Store app on Lion, and open up the APIs for backup/sync so developers can make third party replacements for iTunes! But probably not. <comment16491> 1Password's UI is slow and clunky, but I can't argue with the app's effectiveness. Didn't Lastpass recently have a security breach? I prefer 1Password as it leaves me in control of my password file with Dropbox. <comment16497> @Bryson Nope, no security breach. Lastpass recently had a supsect of anomalous behavior on their network and they took preventive measures about it. Nobody ever complained on losing anything stored on lastpass as far as I know, and that measure was very well seem and documented on the web. Just look for it. You can't arguee with this app's effectiveness, UI or service, but I can arguee against a lack of offering backup from my point of view - which reminds me of *Crashplan vs Carbonite*, the later being the pop-pretty one, but the former being the rock-solid-actually-much-better solution. <comment16498> @Bryson indeed, and I'm already using it. :) <comment16847> There's a lot of nice features... Shortcuts for seeking a custom number of seconds backward and forward. Restore playback position after closing. Open directly in full screen. Play over the desktop background. Slider for playback speed (no shortcuts though). <comment16850> [Cocktail](http://www.maintain.se/cocktail/index.php) has even more options, but is commercial. Then there's also [Secrets.prefpane](http://secrets.blacktree.com/). <comment16851> It also supports using fn as a modifier and snapping windows to screen edges and other elements. <comment16930> Xee's fullscreen mode is much better than Previews. <comment17526> Great simple app. <comment17895> LastPass does the same thing for a lot less money, and it's available cross-platform (including Linux) so you can keep your passwords synced regardless of where you are and what system you're on. <comment17896> Chrome has also had a lot of trouble with caching (specifically clearing cache) in the recent releases. As a web developer, it's a huge problem. I'm on the verge of moving back to FF. <comment17999> Great for annotating PDFs. Notes, highlights, underlines, even freehand drawings. <comment18077> I'm frustated with CyberDuck, it delays to be updated when Goole Docs change some API. <comment18078> The problem with skype now is that was bought from Microsoft. I don't think they will be keeping good. I'm waiting for some Google response offered in Brazil. <comment18079> Fantastic app... <comment18080> Safari get stuck sometimes =[ <comment18081> I prefer online solutions. My office problems are simple. <comment18082> Is it like Kod? I liked Kod... <comment18083> What a great tool! I didn't know it... <comment18395> Adium is not needed anymore starting with Lion :) <comment18440> @Sorin Why is that? I don't think iChat will be able to connect to all those accounts cl.ly/87Ii <comment20885> Maybe useful to mention that SizeUp (also suggested as a separate answer) is its supplementary application from the same developer that provides keyboard shortcuts to do the same. <comment20893> I use this 8 hours a day, everyday. Essential <comment20897> @Cawas - Maybe because Dropbox has Mac spirit: it just works. <comment20898> Xcode4 is free again. <comment20901> And the heaviest. <comment20918> And for the adventurous one, you can use Automator to script some tasks. <comment20920> @neoneye, that's why I use the Command-T (Mac)VIM extension :) <comment20932> I wish I could upvote this twice. I originally switched to a Mac because of TeXShop and LaTeXit! <comment21030> @CarlosZ - Sorry but Shift + green button doesn't do the same. Many apps maximum in the vertical dimension but not in the horizontal dimension. Thankfully Apple has *(mostly)* fixed it with *"Full Screen Apps"* but even it doesn't get it 100% right IMO, so I will continue to use my Cinch. <comment21588> It can do many! Even Facebook. Yeah not all of them but some of those are pretty obscure. I must say the iChat updates in Lion made me ditch Adium. <comment22651> I LOVE Quicksilver. I use it all the time!!!!!! Not only for Spotlight-like capabilities, but many other things. <comment24173> TinkerTool provides a convenient graphical user interface for scores of customization functions that could only be accessed otherwise with command-line commands and obscure edits of system preference files. Many participants in this forum seem to prefer doing everything from the command line, but for those of us who don't, tools like TinkerTool are extremely valuable. TinkerTool will also show you customization options that you probably did not even know existed. <comment24180> Cocktail is not a substitute for TinkerTool. Cocktail's main purpose is to provide system maintenance functions such as clearing caches and repairing permissions. TinkerTool's only purpose is user interface customization. Cocktail has a few user interface customization options, but TinkerTool has many more than Cocktail in that regard. <comment24233> Evernote is not geared for task management.  I love Things interface, but I will like it much more when cloud sync finally debuts this fall. <comment24234> I'll second the usefulness of this app with Simplenote syncing, especially the fork which Matthew Frederick lists above. :) <comment24237> Personally, I like the widget (iStat Pro) that the developers create a bit better.  Free and unobtrusive! :)  http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatpro/ <comment24245> Hub List is basically a clone of THL written because some people were unhappy with THL's development schedule. THL is now released in version 1.0 with a companion iPhone app and cloud syncing. Hub list will likely die off. <comment24262> Homebrew will kick macport's ass anyday <comment24264> I like cornerstone better. <comment24343> Thanks for the heads-up - iTerm2 looks like a great alternative! <comment27108> Cannot live without Growl! <comment27286> Transmit + Textmate are two apps I really can't do without. If Panic could ever get their act together and make Coda a serious contender for Textmate AND make the FTP as good as Transmit (why not, it's a Transmit app) then Coda would rule them all. But not today. <comment27287> I love Alfred. I switched from Quicksilver, though I'm admittedly not a QS poweruser. <comment27288> Thunderbird is not without its quirks, but I like it better than Mac Mail. <comment27289> This is a great little app, though I don't think it's been updated to Lion, yet. <comment27290> This is a great app, and really helped me understand my last Trig class better. <comment27294> @Bryson what I like about Growl is that it gives a central place where I can control all notifications for apps, whether I want them to pop up or just "shut up about it". I'm surprised that Apple didn't add a standard Notification system to Lion, it seems like centralizing this should be the role of the OS. <comment27295> There are some unique things that Quicksilver does, where you can chain things together to create a subject-verb-object kind of construct in one command, like "upload X to Y using Z". That said, it's been years since I used it and I prefer using the terminal for stuff like that. <comment27296> My love/hate for iTunes is that it tries to do everything in one app. (What does organizing apps on your iPhone have to do with "Tunes"?) <comment27298> I used this back in Classic OS 9. There is no point to it that I know anymore, since the standard behavior for Open/Save dialogs is that you can drag any folder or file into them to navigate to that location. If there are other unique benefits, please add info. <comment27409> Lion's new Mail.app now beats the pants off Thunderbird, IMO. <comment27416> I better throw cocoa Emacs.app in here for good measure, this or MacVim are where you go when you are finished with toy editors. (Emacs.app is my preference, however I have it heavily customized from the default, and looks a lot like my ideal version of TextMate now.) <comment27425> I down-voted MacPorts and up-voted Homebrew. Homebrew is a lifesaver. <comment27663> After Lion came out, I switched to Safari because Chrome is way too slow at adapting the goodness. <comment27720> 1Password is on sale on the Mac App Store, only $19.99. <comment28313> Link os broken, use http://freemacsoft.net instead. <comment28677> i don't have the time or motivation to go through and remove *all* the entries that have had some sort of price notation added to the heading.  did the first page, please help if you can.  adding price into the heading is ridiculous... prices are fluid and easily become out of date.  i'm not opposed to mentioning price in the body, but in the heading it makes this list look amateur hour. <comment28688> It is of note that Dropbox has had a sordid history with security and underhanded practices that involve dealing with authorities: http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20072755-281/dropbox-confirms-security-glitch-no-password-required/ and http://paranoia.dubfire.net/2011/04/how-dropbox-sacrifices-user-privacy-for.html <comment28689> Go Garageband! I love using it! <comment28690> Geektool is awesome, but I do have to say that it does eat up memory. :-( <comment28694> I'd be a lot more interested in things if it were not 50 freaking dollars. Considering what it contains, I think it's enormously over priced. $10 would be a no-brainer. $20, and I'd probably still buy it. <comment28732> I've become a total LaunchBar convert. It's well-supported (unlike Quicksilver) and does things that Alfred does not. I quite literally have an extra 30-60 minutes available every day due to LaunchBar. <comment28735> It is now available in the US. And it's easy to create a fake account. <comment28736> This app doesn't seem to be available in my country, Denmark. <comment28737> Hex Fiend has much better keyboard shortcuts. <comment28740> QS can even open new Control/Observe sessions for remote computers from Apple Remote Desktop.  It's not just an app launcher, it's an anything launcher. <comment28741> A shortcut that many people seem to have missed is Print Selected Page, option-cmd-P, in 10.6 and later. <comment28743> @neoneye Im in Denmark and I can assure you that is available as I use it every day. Just click in the link in my answer or throughout their website. <comment28772> I really tried to use iWork, but I just can't. The support for more advanced features - like multiple Tables of Contents - just isn't there. It's a slick piece of software for more uses though. <comment28895> ..........what? <comment28898> It's worth noting that you can use it indefinitely for free. The only difference between paid and free is a little banner on the title-bar, and the warm fuzzies you get from supporting a great project. <comment28901> @Ricket - It will never make the app store. It has too much functionality that significantly violates the (ridiculous) app store guidelines. <comment28953> It has improved over the last six months or so. <comment29000> @FakeName, yep. But I wrote that November of last year, when the app store had been announced but I don't believe details had really been released. I was probably of the naive impression that the app store might actually be good and not as policed as it turned out to be. Also I had just bought my first Mac probably a week or two before that comment (though I was consuming Apple and OS X information at an incredible rate) so that might have something to do with it. <comment29998> I try to keep my desktop empty so then I can achieve the same with Cmd-Shift-H to Hide Others and Cmd-Shift-D to hide the Dock. Fullscreen in Lion really helps too. <comment29999> I used to use the clipboard in QuickSilver but that was unstable. Jumpcut is very stable but it only stores the text, not the formatting. <comment30000> I use this so much every day. One of the things I love is the easy hotkeying. For example I have a hotkey that runs an applescript that opens a new tab in Chrome so I can do websearches or visit websites with autocompletion. <comment30001> Spotlight and Quicksilver are two different beasts. Quicksilver allows you to match entries in your catalog with a few keystrokes, and spotlight allows you to search your computer for words. If you type "sp" in Quicksilver you might get "**S**ystem **P**references" if you use that a lot, or "**S**teve **P**orter" if you send him a lot of mails/IMs. Spotlight will just show you all things with "sp" in their name or contents <comment30109> I mean Cmd-Option... Sigh <comment31515> I've been using this for many years now and it has saved my stuff on several occasions, plus it's great for when you upgrade that harddrive on your Mac. It's being updated whenever needed (and no more than that, which is also great). <comment31527> @daviesgeek — How so? I've got it running 25 scripts currently for a total of 18.9 MB. In 1998 that would have been considered eating memory, but not today. <comment31529> If I could upvote this ten times. The most awesome, the most underrated editor. Actually it's the first code editor I fell in love with on Mac. I also suggest checking out [Will Bond's page of Sublime Text 2 plugins](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/). <comment31530> My it's ugly! I hate to see cross-platform software on Mac. Of course it does “the job” but I find applications like this degrading the whole experience. <comment31535> VLC is ugly. [MPlayerX](http://mplayerx.org/) is so much more Mac-spirited. <comment31536> If you're into TextMate, have a look at [Sublime Text 2](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82/which-os-x-applications-do-you-find-indispensable/11672#11672). You won't be disappointed. <comment31538> I hate Firefox UI on Mac. I can't explain why, toolbar and shades and colors feel very, very wrong. <comment31578> @ioi Hmm... It may just be the PPC computer I was running it on. :-) <comment32691> This is basically the better version of OpenOffice.org, forked when [Oracle refused to cooperate with the community](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libreoffice#Initial_release). <comment32694> Better app is Fluid. <comment32695> @TheWellington Fluid is pretty cool! I've never even heard of it. Thanks! <comment32749> @Jonathan. Ditto! <comment35632> Actually BetterTouchTool does this...for free! <comment35676> @Bryson Both of those issues are the fault of the apps in question, there's not a lot Growl can do about apps not using it properly. <comment36125> I'm going to have to agree with @edgerunner. In my opinion, the UI is horrible, and it's too bulky on workstations with smaller screens. Aside from that, you honestly can't compare it with other apps since there aren't many IDE's to compare it with in the first place. For those who develop PHP applications, Eclipse PDT + Xdebug is heaven-sent. Oh and TextMate is a text editor, not an IDE :) <comment37067> I've since switched to http://www.iterm2.com/ which has visor-styel functionality built-in. <comment38131> this is a great hex editor. <comment39246> I up-voted the comment about InsomniaX but actually wanted to recommend [InsomniaX 2.0 – Built for Lion](http://semaja2.net/archives/206) from the same developer - makes it easy to run clamshell mode on Snow-Leopard with external display <comment39474> And Growl is no longer free, it costs $1.99 now at App Store. <comment39601> One big drawback: the machine muse already be awake for scheduled backups to occur. <comment42023> I tend to go with VLC or QuickTime Player with Perian in this case, I find MPlayer to be too buggy. <comment42024> @neoneye Got a link for NameChanger? <comment42025> I have both Secrets and TinkerTool. TT is great for getting to many hidden system config options and I use Secrets for handling the rest. <comment42026> @neoneye Link for Hex Fiend please? <comment42027> When they moved away from being just a BitTorrent client I dropped it. A Java-based media application and torrent client? My computer is crushed under the weight of it. <comment44915> Just couldn't live without this. A quick and simple way to see my CPU usage, memory usage, etc. etc. <comment44916> Runs beautifully on a Mac Mini under my TV... <comment44919> +1 I actually use this on my on my Mac Mini connected to the TV. Its "Dim when inactive" menu bar feature (coupled with hiding the Dock) gives the appearance of a having nothing on screen but the desktop picture <comment44978> For the last year, I moved from VLC to MPlayer X without regret. I like its interface a lot more than VLC's. I also have Perian installed for when I use Quicklook or play a video in Finder (the play button in the file icon). <comment45051> Apps no longer need to have Growl installed in order to use Growl notifications, so users would only need to purchase it if they want to customize their notifications. This also means apps no longer need to secretly install Growl. More info on their [note to developers](http://growl.info/notetodevelopers). Growl is still open source, too, and there's a link to the source code on that page as well. <comment45080> Now you don't need iTunes for a lot of things (OTA updates, Setup, etc.) <comment47445> Seems like ControlPlane (see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/41826/19225) is the "new" MarcoPolo:  _ControlPlane creating using code from version 2.5.1 of the MarcoPolo project still available at http://www.symonds.id.au/marcopolo/.  Development of MarcoPolo seems to have come to a halt and ControlPlane attempts to pick up where MarcoPolo left off.  As of version 1.0.0, ControlPlane is 64bit and fixes the WiFi Evidence Source._ <comment47478> I quit using Evernote and transitioned completely to NVAlt. It's totally killer. <comment47480> def. +1 for mentioning AppCleaner. It's really a great app <comment47481> Filezilla is a lifesaver for quick and easy FTP <comment47482> I use this to work at night for 1: saving my eyes and 2: if I want to work on my laptop in bed without pissing off my wife! <comment47729> This is no different from [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41969/what-input-devices-do-you-find-to-be-an-indespensable-part-of-using-your-mac), which was just closed. <comment47822> I've tried Readiris many times since maybe version 7, and after many hours and a LOT of money, I hate the program with a passion. Perhaps version 12 is wonderful, but to my mind this is a very un-Mac-like program that not only produces poor results, but also crashes and corrupts itself. The developer cares very little about the Mac, and progress has been slow. I used it because despite this horrid performance, it was the best OCR app available. Luckily I don't do OCR much anymore, and while I hope Readiris has improved, I am a skeptic. <comment52969> To me, iWork is the Fisher Price of Office. I tried making a simple graph in Numbers, and I soon found it to be impossible. It's decent for the iPad and others, though. <comment55121> +1. But... Don't blindly "OK"  the "remove" offer and delete good files when upgrading an app! <comment56651> VLC is ugly since the version 2 update <comment57683> Safari integrates better with the whole OS X Lion experience <comment58205> Give AppCode a try - lots of refactoring and editing conveniences <comment58212> Note: its now called TotalTerminal -- you may want to update the name/link. <comment58608> Updated.  Note that this is a community wiki- you can edit it too. <comment58609> As a side note, this functionality is built into iTerm2, which I now use in favor of TotalTerminal. <comment58619> Sublime Text 2 is extremely fast. It's actively developed too. <comment58839> I also would like to upvote multiple times, this is a fantastic piece of software. Finally I get the power of VIM without the clunk! <comment59548> @CyberSkull here is a link to NameChanger http://www.mrrsoftware.com/MRRSoftware/NameChanger.html <comment63408> I used to use Cinch, but I switched to Moom for greater functionality and customization. <comment63734> POP accounts have been added too. <comment64405> -1 on Anti-Aquamacs sentiment.  I use Emacs on 3 platforms and when I'm on my Mac it's always Aquamacs.  I had to undo some of  Aquamacs attempts to fit in the MacOS world ( mainly WRT system keyboard shortcuts ). After that small tweak, it works just like Emacs on my other OSes. <comment65156> Perian developers decided to cease any further development on Perian. There won't be any new releases or fixes for MKV support if nobody stakes over. <comment67747> The install script does not seem to work under lion? <comment68851> I was just adding this one. <comment69958> Or use Aquamacs for a version pre-customized for OS X. I wouldn't cite VIM bindings as a key feature of Emacs though... <comment69991> The vim bindings are evil are awesome after too many years of ctrl-[key] really started to hurt my wrists. I almost went to vim, but then discovered evil. <comment76749> An example subject-verb-object action: moving files. Select a few files, hit ⌘-⎋ (escape), Tab, type "move", Tab, then type a few chars of the destination and Return. Quicksilver moves the files then redisplays with the moved files in the subject, so you can open them or 'reveal' them in Finder (or any other supported verb). Way faster than dragging through nested Finder windows. <comment77119> Thanks for your answer. Can you add a little more information about CCleaner? What exactly does it do? <comment79437> Xcode is great. It is the reason I got a Mac. <comment80729> `This project is no longer being maintained.` <comment82446> Why not using Synergy+ ? <comment82644> Well, for windows migrants like me, Eclipse feels like being at home. I agree that it's UI is not at par with mac, but still I use it for my android development. <comment82645> I've used last pass for more than a year now, and I still like it. I never thought of trying any other password manager like 1password. I do not need to ;) <comment82646> I wished they had Picasa Viewer inbuilt like windows version. <comment82647> I use Easy Rename for it's simple find and replace kinda UI <comment82651> I've used this app for almost my entire PC life. Good to have it on Mac too. <comment84625> Too bad it doesn't work behind a proxy with non-default ports... <comment88393> @MatthewRead The difference is we close hardware shopping questions in almost all cases and we don't close software recommendation questions in almost all cases. There have been some [meta] discussions about either locking or closing or deleting questions like this that fail to be maintained and become stale / out dated. <comment89733> Still my favorite developer tools of all browsers. <comment92436> I use keepassX because it is open source software, vs lastpass, 1password which are not. I'm no fan of the non-native look, but my best alternative - and I would love to be corrected on this - is to use an encrypted textfile <comment92489> Dropbox is also the number one in data leak from within enterprise networks. I wouldn't advise a friend to use Dropbox for important data. <comment96835> @FakeName how is this possible? They mention 14-days-trial? <comment96836> -1 cannot see a reason to use Thunderbird over the Mail.app. At least in Ubuntu, Evolution beated Thunderbird 1-10. Now in OS X, Mail.app is very good, enough simple. <comment96837> TimeMachine not enough? <comment96870> @hhh - When the "trial" expires, the only change is a little banner at the top of every window saying "unregistered". <comment96871> [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) totally mops the floor with every other text editor. <comment96941> Link above is now redirected elsewhere; no "Hex Editor" tool is evident at the destination.  **Hex Fiend**, an open source alternative, can be found at http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/ <comment97229> Apple should have bought and integrated this app into the years ago. <comment97232> I cant live without Dropbox and Logmein for that matter. The best 1 2 punch in the Biz <comment97234> Alfred is pretty sweet <comment97235> Handbrake is awesome, I use it with mythbuntu <comment97239> Xcode includes a lot of other stuff, like a .plist editor and command line tools. Instruments app (that uses dtrace) is an awesome tool for peeping into your Mac. And it's free from the App Store. <comment97541> @Lamnk Even MplayerOSX Extended regarded as the future of MPlayerX available at http://www.mplayerosx.ch/ <comment100667> @Josh: Healthy yes, clean, no. <comment100668> If you don't need to share a password file with others or open it on other platforms, simply use Keychain Access (comes with OS X). Otherwise KeePassX is still handy. <comment100710> That URL is no longer working. <comment102767> I love this app. There are still some regularly scheduled radio shows that this app records for me like an audio TiVo. It will also let you record the streaming radio from an app while ignoring other app or system sounds. <comment102784> Yes that's what I use it for!! <comment107099> XtraFinder does almost the same and is free <comment107100> why is transmission so much better? <comment107101> this is one application I actually bought, because it is incredibly handy <comment107102> divvy is also a good option <comment107105> I don't see the point off this application <comment107109> I would rather pay money for things that I rely on and work well, in order to ensure they don't disappear in the future. <comment107124> By far better than ShiftIt and Cinch! <comment108369> That's the only reason I bought a Mac. Though after buying I got to know how good a mac can be. <comment108370> I use it everyday for any text edit on the go. <comment108843> Should really separate this into its components. I find Keynote is superior to PowerPoint (except when you need to interchange with Windows folks), but that's just about it. Numbers doesn't hold a candle against Excel whereas Pages is so-so. <comment117940> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TXJcM3hUhjs/S7ApfoG3xHI/AAAAAAAAJPE/f5j_hhXiD-k/s1600/browses-and-transportation-10548-1269487647-48.jpg (look top left) <comment117941> It's cool and all, but what's the point? <comment117942> As "lightweight" as the interface may lead you to believe, Chrome is VERY resource intensive. <comment117943> You don't need this! The use of these types of utilities is hyped by intense advertising, and it's generally a huge scam industry! <comment117944> For the most part, these types of utilities actually SLOW system performance (cache files are a good thing, they're designed to store the result of repetitive actions so the same actions don't have to done over and over again). I'd advise only using OnyX is a troubleshooting utility for fixing glitches <comment117946> Sophos anti-virus (like all other anti-virus) ONLY scans for windows malware (to avoid accidental contamination of networked PCs) <comment117947> Macs DON'T need this. Temp files, cookies and caches are GOOD (they're invented for a reason) and significantly speed up your system! I'd only even recommend clearing them for troubleshooting issues <comment117959> "lightweight" is not the word I used.
