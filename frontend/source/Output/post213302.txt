Assigning icons system-wide based on filename without extension <body> I'd like Finder to display a particular icon for files based purely on its filename, not its extension. For instance, for a web project I have a Makefile sitting amidst PHP files, which all display the Atom logo:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6y2lW.png" width="203" /  The file already opens with Atom when double-clicked, even though TextEdit is technically my system's default text editor (which I never use, because Atom rules).  Is it possible to automatically assign an icon to makefiles system-wide, strongwithout/strong manually copy+pasting an icon into it through the properties pane? Preferably without installing any third-party software, as this is really a cosmetic thing that's not worth having system bloat over.  I'm hoping there's some codedefaults/code-related thing I could tweak, or an entry in a codeplist/code file somewhere.  <answer213871> h3Setting Atom icon via command line for Makefile/h3  There is no direct way to set icons based on filename only, but one can set them via command line and then apply to all makefiles on the Mac.  Here are the steps to set codeAtom's/code icon to a specific codeMakefile/code via command line (assuming you Developer Tools are installed).  ol liGet the Atom icon file from code/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/file.icns/code/li liConvert the image to iconbr codesips -i file.icns/code/li liExtract the icon to its own resource file   code/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/DeRez -only icns file.icns &gt; tmpicns.rsrc/code/li liAppend this resource to the file you want to icon-ize code/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/Rez -append tmpicns.rsrc -o Makefile/code/li liUse the resource to set the iconbr code/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/SetFile -a C Makefile/code/li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  you can run codemdfind -name makefile/code to get all the makefiles in your system and write a script to do the above on them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/duv3l.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment258134> Thanks! Although I'm guessing there's no way to apply the icon to all **future** Makefiles as well...? (I'm tipping the answer is "no", but that wouldn't surprise me). <comment258139> Also, what does step #2 do? Isn't the `icns` format already an icon file? <comment258140> in this case it is. But I have added that step so that you can convert other files to icons using this command, if required. <comment258142> Alight, this'll have to do then. =) Thank you!
