What causes iPhone low battery crashes? Is there a software fix? <body> Some iPhone users (especially those with devices that've been in use for a while) encounter a problem where the device crashes once the battery gets low. For example:     ul   li"After updating to iOS 7 my iPhone 5 has been doing something strange.   When the battery gets low (usually around 20-30%), iOS will shut down   completely, and when you try to power the phone back on it flashes on   the screen telling you to plug the phone in to charge it (saying that   the battery is almost completely dead).   The phone refuses to power   on until you plug it in, but strongonce I plug the phone in and power it   back on, the battery life shows the last percentage it was at before   it crashed (20-30%)/strong. This has happened to me more than once, so I know   it's not just some crazy fluke."   https://discussions.apple.com/message/23587500#23587500/li   li"I have a 3GS that is almost 2 years old now and had a hard life. It   has now developed a tendency to crash when the battery gets below 25%.   it will restart using the top button ok but strongas soon as you put any   strain on the battery it crashes when at this low level/strong. When the   phone is charged it seems to work fine."   http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1139488/li   li"I have a weird problem with my iPhone 5. My phone switches off when   the battery is low. I was at 23% charge and just browsing facebook   when my battery died. The other day I was at 13% charge and it   switched off. Last week 17%.. It refuses to switch back on until it   was plugged into the wall. I have tried restoring the phone and set up   as new but I still have the same problem. strongIt just seems to switch off   when the battery is low at different percentages./strong"   https://discussions.apple.com/message/22284705#22284705/li   /ul   It seems to happen on various model iPhones and versions of the OS; it's currently happening to me on a heavily used two year old 4S running iOS 6.1.1.  TidBITS suggests that:     "The common element in these crashes is low battery life, usually under 20 percent, although one crash occurred at almost 30 percent. When I give the iPhone power, it restarts immediately and shows the expected amount of battery life remaining. strongSo it’s not that the battery is actually running out; instead, [iOS's] power management code is freaking out once the battery level falls to around 20 percent./strong I do see a number of LowBatteryLog files in Settings  General  About  Diagnostics &amp; Usage  Diagnostic &amp; Usage Data, though their contents don’t reveal a smoking gun. Letting the battery run down completely and then recharging entirely to recalibrate it made no difference."   (NB. TidBITS writes about this as it pertains to iOS 7 only.)  So, my question:  ul liDo we know, technically, what is causing these crashes beyond simply "the power management code is freaking out"?/li liAre there any software hacks, fixes or usage habits (beyond usual battery saving/care techniques and "just get a new battery/don't let the battery get low!") that might help avoid these crashes?/li /ul  (I'm interested in general answers, but in case it's of use here are the low battery logs from my two most recent crashes.)  <answer113645> Those log files are total benefit with no downside. Your phone is out of juice and will shut down anyway. The OS is logging the data so you can take action on it if you choose. They don't cause anything other than logging what led up to the low power condition.   I watch my LowBatteryLog-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss.plist log files quite regularly to know when to seek service for my battery.  In general, if the device shuts off with more than 10% of power projected, I also take it in for service and almost always the iOS diagnostics shows the battery as replaceable under warranty when I experience what you diagnose.  Technically, the lithium polymer cells can exhibit voltage drops when they are out of specification but not yet failing or in a state where they should be shut off and not used again.  Looking more deeply into your two posted logs, I would focus on these lines primarily:  precodeAwake Time: 03:45:27 (13526) Standby Time: 04:55:29 (17729) Partial Charge: 0 Capacity: 0 Voltage: 3469 mV /code/pre  When Partial Charge is 1 - that means that you plugged it in and the device received a charge between when it was full and first removed from power and it eventually shut itself off due to low power detection. In those cases, I really only focus on the Voltage - knowing when the device decided to preserve the remaining voltage for standby and battery protection.   The log above shows a very short awake time and indicates a likelihood that the battery isn't providing the correct duration and amount of power. Even if the CPU is full use, all radios are on, speaker cranking, brightness max - I expect 4 to 5 hours on most devices.  Unless that 3h45m run was a rare occurrence, my estimate is you need a hardware repair as sleeping more often will allow the sleep time to increase, but never increase the active time.  <comment133411> Related question I asked while looking into this: ["Regular crashes on iPhone 4S/iOS 6.1.1: due to old battery, or because of updated-for-iOS-7 apps?"](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/113508/regular-crashes-on-iphone-4s-ios-6-1-1-due-to-old-battery-or-because-of-update)
