What are some good screencapturing applications? <body>    strongPossible Duplicates:/strongbr   Creating a professional looking screencast?br   Recommendations for video editing + screen capturing softwarebr   Camtasia, Screenflow, or &ldquo;Other?&rdquo;       What are some good screencapturing applications for OS X? I am specifically looking for an application that records in HD video. I have used QT Player X, but I'm wondering if there are some alternatives out there.  <answer24768> I'm partial to Screenflow. It works well, it's easy to use, and it's good for both capturing the screen, capturing audio (or even video via FaceTime camera) of you narrating the screencast, and can handle mixing the different sources of input. At $99, it isn't cheap, but it does work well. I use it for demo videos for my students.  <answer24775> if you not want to buy software in lion you can use preview to capture screen in menu file "Take Screen Shot" or use command + shift +3 (full screen) / command + shift + (select area) and command + shift + 4 + spacebar to capture active windows screen  <answer24776> Screeny is another utility that may be of interest to you and comes in substantially cheaper than many in the category of screen capture apps.

This is a duplicate of previously asked questions, and I've noticed that you often ask questions that are duplicates. <comment27847> @Negrino I did search. Where's the duplicate? <comment27850> @daviesgeek - Your search-fu needs some workâ€¦ [This would have been a good place to start looking](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/screen-capture), for instance. <comment27917> @Dori I am so sorry!!
