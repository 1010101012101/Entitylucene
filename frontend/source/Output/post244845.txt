How do add "Recent Folders" item to the Finder sidebar? <body> In the menu Go  Recent Places you can get a list of recently accessed folders. I want to add this to the Finder sidebar, but I am not seeing any clear explanation of how to do this.  <answer244847> Use a smart folder.   ol liRight click the Finder in the Dock/li liSelect New Smart Folder/li liPress the plus button/li liSelect kind. /li liSelect Last Modified/Opened or whatever you want. /li liSelect 'This Mac' /li liSave your smart folder. When saving, make sure 'Add to Sidebar' is checked. Name your smart folder and you're good to go!/li /ol  <comment301835> Thanks this seems to work. However I am wondering how the "opened in the last x days" part works. If I set it for 3 days, but then do not use my Mac for a week, will this come up empty (e.g. no 'recent' folders)? A more numeric approach such as "the last 20 accessed folders" is closer to what I had in mind. Also I was hoping to have the folders themselves directly listed in the sidebar; is that not possible? <comment301836> It will likely come up empty if you abandon the Mac longer than the set date, and no, I am not aware of any way to make the folders themselves show up. <comment301932> @user5359531, In your comment you said, "_Also I was hoping to have the folders themselves directly listed in the sidebar; is that not possible?_"... do you seriously want to add individual folders for each Recent Folder to the Sidebar? That could add up to 10 more objects under FAVORITES, are you sure you want that vs having a Recent Folder object on the Sidebar that when clicked shows the list of folders? It's probably programmatically possible however it's not so simple or straight forward due to how the information is stored. I've see an AppleScript that extracts the info and it's complex. <comment301956> Yes that is actually exactly what I would like, a dynamic list of recently accessed directories in the sidebar. I am constantly jumping between the same half dozen at a time so it would be much more convenient than having to navigate a menu or parent directory every time. But in the mean time I will settle with the solution given here.
