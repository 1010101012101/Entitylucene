Sharp reduction in SSD read/write speed one day after installing it <body> I installed a Samsung 840 Pro 128 GB SSD on my MacBook Pro 2012 13â€³. I had installed OS X on my external drive and I did a disk copy to my SSD. When I did a speed check using Blackmagic Disk Speed too, I got a read speed of ~500&nbsp;MB/s and write speed of ~450&nbsp;MB/s.  After installing some more software I checked the SSD speed and the read speed is ~340&nbsp;MB/s. I had enabled TRIM. What is the issue here? My SSD is brand new. Should I do a clean install of OS X? Will erasing free space do any good?
