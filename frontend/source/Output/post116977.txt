How to prevent PressAndHold from loading? <body> I have already disabled PressAndHold through terminal, but I see that it still appears as a process on Activity Monitor. It is taking 2.9 MB for me, but I want it to stop and not to begin at all. When I try force quitting, it pops back up. How do you permanently remove this process OR prevent it from activating and taking RAM resources?  <comment136761> What process is that? I can't find it on mine.
