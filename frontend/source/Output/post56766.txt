Different Keyboards equals different backlights? <body> i replaced my old keyboard (german layout) with an us keyboard. It works fine but the backlight seems to be misfit a litte. Is it possible that they using different kinds of backlights?   <comment65200> Misfit how, please describe how it is being different? <comment65232> i dont really know if it is different but i think so, because the backlight is irregular. <comment65278> I don't believe the backlighting differs on a per language basis. May be it's different manufacturing process because the US keyboard is newer than the German one? <comment65341> Which MacBook / MacBook Pro do you have? <comment65462> i own the MacBook Pro 15" early 2011
