Apple Watch exercise calculation <body> I just walked on my treadmill for 20 minutes. I don't see anything in the exercise ring. How is the exercise time counted?  <answer223782> According to Apple, anything requiring the effort of a brisk walk or greater will be counted in the Exercise ring.  I imagine that your heart rate has a lot to do with how much effort your Apple Watch detects in the activity that you're preforming, but I don't know what BPM it calls exercise.  <answer223791> Have you tried calibrating your Apple Watch? According to the support note, calibration helps improve accuracy of things like distance and pace when GPS is not available. An example of this would be when you are walking or running on a treadmill. Hopefully this helps!  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204516  <answer251563> If you hold onto the handle bars, your WATCH has no way to tell that you’re exercising. Your arms need to be swinging during Walking activities for WATCH to credit you exercise minutes.  As @RedEagle2000 mentioned, your activity also needs to cross a certain intensity threshold. That intensity is specific to each individual, with WATCH learning your exercise capacity through your measured heart rate throughout the day, your other activities, etc. Calibrating your WATCH as per Apple’s instructions can help in that department.
