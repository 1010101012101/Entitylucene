Where is "Today" and "Yesterday" in Finder menu? <body> A folder or place search place that contained everything I used "Today" and "Yesterday" is missing from my new Yosemite finder on the left.  Is it not possible to have this?  It was a quick easy way to recall specific things when working on a lot of different things.  <answer154551> They don't appear to be there by default, but you can add them back in pretty easily.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2ASy.png" alt="Screenshot of Finder offering to save search and add to sidebar"  ol liOpen a Finder window/li liType "today" into the search box. /li liIt should offer you two options in a dropdown menu "Dates: today" and "Filenames - Name Matches: today".
