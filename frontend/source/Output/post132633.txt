What does "build 7E18" in "iOS 3.1.3 (build 7E18) " mean? <body> I read this else where  "iOS 3.1.3 (build 7E18)" so  WHat does  "build 7E18" mean?  <comment157095> The build number is usually incremented every time a product is built for testing by a company. It is a unique identifier for that specific version, since there may exist many different "builds" of iOS 3.1.3. The released build was apparently 7E18 (32280 in decimal). <comment157115> It means your iOS is really freakin' old!
