Can I use my UK MAC desktop in the Cayman Islands <body> I am moving to the Cayman Islands, which uses the same power source as the US, will I be able to use my MAC desktop there using a US adapter?   Thanks  <answer72736> Without knowing the computer you're using it's hard to say, but probably strongYes/strong, there should be no problem.   strongMost/strong Apple products have an strongauto-switching/strong power supply which monitors the incoming voltage and automatically switches itself accordingly, strongothers don't/strong, and must be changed manually, and others, are regional specific.   Here you can find a list of the Apple products and whether if they've got this auto-switching emfeature/em.  Checking your computer's manual should shed some light on this, too.
