Why does my Terminal window close automatically? <body> I need to use my Terminal window on a MacBook Air but it closes about 10 seconds after I open it.  Is there a setting or is it possible another program is causing it to close?  If I type quickly I can run say diskutil but it closes after it runs.  <answer274668> If you have a system administrator that has blocked terminal, you should get permission from your system administrator to unblock it.  <comment23865> It sounds like terminal is crashing. Can you open console app and look for error messages which might be related to the problem? <comment23870> Maybe your .profile or .bashrc is corrupted. Can you use a different account on your Mac, open Terminal.app from there and ssh to your account? <comment23903> Since you get a prompt, it's likely a resource limit is killing the newly launched processes. Have you confirmed this happens after a reboot? Also - a new user account would be a quick way to rule out any settings on your account. <comment23985> Is Terminal quitting or is it still open when the window closes? If Terminal is gone, it sounds like it must be a crash, in which case there should be a crash log for it. If it's just the window that closes, it sounds like something is causing the shell to exit. By default Terminal won't close a window when the shell exits, but you may have customized the preference to do so. Make sure **Terminal  Preferences  Settings  [profile]  Shell  When the shell exits** is set to **Don't close the window**. That will help narrow down the cause of the problem. <comment65354> Fire up `Console` and see if you find something about Terminal crashing. <comment232324> As a method to see whether this is an issue with Terminal.app or some `.profile` or `.bashrc` file, try to reproduce the issue with [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com). IMHO it's the better terminal app anyway.
