MacBook Pro keeps shutting down after update to 10.12.6 <body> I recently updated to macOS Sierra 10.12.6 on my MacBook Pro (2013). However, since then it keeps shutting down every 15 minutes or so. If I restart it, it will boot back without an error message but will then shut down again after roughly 15 more minutes have passed.  This issue occurs regardless of the apps I'm using and whether its plugged into power or running off battery.  <comment369235> It's a similar problem, but I thought I'd ask the question specifically relating to the 10.12.6 update because the problem started occurring immediately after the update. <comment369250> It's going to be very difficult to figure it out based on the info you provided.  I haven't heard/read of that update causing problems.  If you have a backup, go back to before the update and see if the problem is still there.
