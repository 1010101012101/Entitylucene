Clear multiple entries form "Open With" context menu <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to fix lsregister failing associations after reboot?       How do I clear multiple entries of the same application from the "Open With" context menu?  <answer77155> You need to reset the Launch Services Database  Use the following command in the terminal:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user  /code/pre  Wait until the terminal returns you to a prompt.  You should now be all set.  My understanding is that this will work in anything from 10.5 and up.    <comment89468> Awesome rephrasing of this question - I'll link it to our older version of this quesion so others can see the answer no matter how they search the site.
