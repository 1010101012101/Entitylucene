Citizen Erased: My Mac deleted my user account! Please help <body> The last time I used my user account I was browsing the net and sending an email with the built in Mail app. But I accidentally unplugged the Mac and when it came back, my user account wasn't on the Login screen anymore.  I tried using this guide: http://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-rebuild-a-user-account-in-os-x/  And after trying to recreate the account, nothing happens. So I turn to the Console log to see what's going on, and I get this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdAnk.png" alt="console log"  It's like OS X blacklisted my username or something like that. Also, I noticed was that my user account folder no longer has a pretty house on it and instead has that ugly default folder icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JCg5F.png" alt="/users/ folder"  Anyway, even though this is an old PowerBook G4 with OS X 10.5 on it I hope you'll be able to help me out claim my account back.  <answer161338> Gonna have to go with "Nevermind, fixed it." discussions.apple.com/thread/2760585  <comment188533> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
