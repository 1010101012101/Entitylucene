Turn off Macbook automatic hibernation mode? <body> I'm having a problem with my MacBook Pro (mid 2012) where by when I lock my machine and then return several hours later (at least six hours) it will not respond to me pressing the keyboard.  I have to press the power button and then it boots up requiring a password.  Once this password has been entered it takes a few minutes to slowly start all of my processes again (I hear skype logging in behind the blue screen) eventually my bluetooth mouse and keyboard are connected.  Finally I can then enter my password to actually gain access to my machine.  This is a problem I've had with OSX since Mavericks was released.  Below is a screenshot of the settings I have tried to change (everything possible) to stop this stupid behaviour and it still persists!  img src="https://i.imgur.com/QIsDeoS.png" alt="Settings - Screenshot" img src="https://i.imgur.com/W4rpHHM.png" alt="Settings - Screenshot" img src="https://i.imgur.com/9vBPuTD.png" alt="Settings - Screenshot"  <answer198997> From a Terminal, use the following command to disable hibernation:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 /code/pre  If you later want to enable hibernation, use:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3 /code/pre  If you want to free up the disk space used by hibernation, use the following command:  precodesudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage /code/pre  ul liNote: This file is automatically recreated as needed if hibernation is reenabled and it doesn't already exist./li /ul  <comment238433> Thanks, i'll try this later looks perfect though :)
