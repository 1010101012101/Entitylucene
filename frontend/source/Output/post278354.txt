Iphone 6S How to snap a picture using sound <body> I'm using an iPhone 6S+  Is there an app that will allow me to snap a picture when there is a sound? Ideally, it would be adjustable so that a sufficient sound level is needed to trigger it.  I want to make an iPhone 3D scanner by rotating a table and producing 50 clicks in a full turn. Each click would snap a picture and the 50 pictured would be assembled into 3D printable file by Autodesk Remake.  Thanks  <comment350269> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request. <comment350270> This may not help, but the default camera app can be controlled through the volume buttons on the headphone jack. If you can get a cheap pair of headphones with in-line controls you might be able to connect those to the phone and "press" the button with your contraption. <comment350383> Yes, but I am looking to do this with no physical connection. The hardware gets much more complicated and less flexible if a button has to be pressed.
