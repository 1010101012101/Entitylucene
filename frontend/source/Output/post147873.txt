cannot install iOS 7.1 simulator for Xcode 6 (weird file mounting error) <body> I have codeXCode 5.1/code working without problems with iOS 7.1 simulators until yesterday when I upgraded to codeXcode 6/code, the installation was completed successfully, but whenever I try to download and install iOS 7.1 simulator from codePreferences -&gt; Downloads/code, it gives me this weird message:  precodeCould not download and install iOS 7.1 Simulator.

I completely removed codeXCode/code using codeCleanMyMac 2/code app, restarted the machine, re-installed codeXcode/code from codeMAC App Store/code, the installation was successful, restarted the machine again, and then tried to install iOS 7.1 simulator but to no avail.  <answer148292> ol liQuit Xcode (kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdQ/kbd)./li liDelete the code~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/code folder./li liReopen Xcode./li /ol
