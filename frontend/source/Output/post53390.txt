Finder icon size slider broken, how to fix? <body> The slider in the bottom-right corner of Finder windows doesn't change the icon size for me. This is of course with "Icon View" selected. What am I doing wrong? It worked before, up until Lion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPdEH.png" alt=""  <answer53391> When you are in strongThumbnail view/strong, press kbdcmd/kbd+ kbd2/kbd (to get the strongList view/strong) and then switch back to strongThumbnail view/strong with kbdcmd/kbd+ kbd1/kbd.br Normally, it should get your slider working!  <comment61092> Never use List view so I wouldn't have discovered your fix. Thank you! <comment61094> You're welcome!
