Require login to be able to see anything on wiki server? <body> In addition to having wikis, the wiki server built into OS X Server also allows users to host blogs and personal file storage.  By default, it appears that these functions are enabled, even if you are not currently logged in.  Is there a way to lock down the wiki server so that when someone goes to companyserver.com/wiki it doesn't give them access to anything but a login prompt?  <answer80830> Check the following link https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4156010 I have not tried it.
