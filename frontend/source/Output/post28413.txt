How do I change streaming buffer size in iTunes 10.5? <body> I want to change the buffering of streaming radio in iTunes 10.5.  Every help document I've found online says to go to codeEdit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Advanced Tab/code.  I see no such buffer option there.  I'm running on Windows XP Service Pack 3.    <answer28450> I recall seeing it there once upon a time.  It appears they've removed this option.  <comment32837> Thanks.  Bummer.  Using Windows Media Player for streaming radio it is. <comment45354> I really hope they add the buffer option back - it's really useful in controlling the smoothness to real-time-ness (if that's a word) ratio.
