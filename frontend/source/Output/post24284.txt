Playlist folder not showing songs from all child playlists <body> I have created a playlist folder which contains 2 regular playlists (i.e. not smart playlists).  The hierarchy is like this:  precodeOccasions | +--- Party mix 1 | +--- Party mix 2 /code/pre  In iTunes, if I click on the codeOccasions/code folder, I can see all of the songs from codeParty mix 1/code, but none of the songs from codeParty mix 2/code.  I can't see any difference between the 2 playlists, and because it's not a smart playlist there aren't any settings available.  Should a playlist folder automatically include all songs from its child playlists?  Any ideas about why it wouldn't be showing songs from both playlists?  <answer33851> I had this happen to me for the second time recently. I just fixed it! I thought I looked up a fix the first time, which I haven't been able to find. However this is what I did just now.  I copied the name of the playlist to the clipboard, then I simply deleted the whole playlist (for me this was fine because it was one of MANY playlists in the folder, this one only having one song in it).  Created a new playlist in the folder, pasted the name in, then added the song to the playlist! Pop! It showed up in the folder now!  For you, I would probably drag all the songs to a new playlist outside of the folder, delete the playlist inside the folder, then either re-create the original playlist by creating another one in the folder and dragging all the songs from the 'backup' (outside the folder), or perhaps try dragging the 'backup' back into the folder straight away.  *you could also try using the "New Playlist from Selection" function (command-shift-n) (under the file menu) (assuming Mac Platform).  I of course can't try any of these other methods until I encounter this problem again.  PLEASE NOTE: deleting the SONG from the playlist and then adding it again had NO EFFECT. The reference to the playlist itself seems to be the problem/bug.  I'm running v10.5 (141), but this happened on an older version as well.  <answer92323> I was able to simply drag the playlists out of the folder, then drag them back in again.  <comment33082> Are you sure that "Party Mix 1" and "Party Mix 2" contain different songs? <comment33286> @patrix - Yes, they definitely contain different songs. <comment37581> I cannot reproduce the problem. What version of iTunes? <comment37634> @Daniel - I can't remember the exact version (it's on my work PC) but it was the first version that supported iOS 5 as I downloaded it to upgrade my iPhone.  So it's a pretty recent version. <comment41248> Thanks heaps - this fixed my problem.  Note that "New Playlist from Selection" didn't work; I had to manually create a new playlist, drag the songs from the old playlist, and then remove the old playlist.
