Used Disk Utility to resize Macintosh HD partition on Boot Camp-enabled machine - now can't boot Windows <body> I have a late-2013 MacBook Pro running the latest Mac OS Sierra (updated this afternoon). I have Windows 10 installed on a Boot Camp partition.  I decided to decrease the size of the Mac OS partition as I'm running low on space in the Boot Camp partition. So I used Disk Utility to shrink the Mac OS partition, then formatted the unused space as FAT32.  There were no reported problems.  I then restarted the MacBook. It's set to boot directly into Windows, but when I restarted all I got was a blank screen. I waited... but got nothing.  So I forced the MacBook off (holding the power button) and restarted again, this time holding code‚å•/code: I got to the partition selection screen, from where I clicked on "Windows". It froze. The pointer becomes unresponsive. Again, nothing.  I can still start up and select to boot into Mac OS but I can do nothing with the partition from where I do my job, leaving me in a bit of a panic.  In Disk Utility, I've clicked on the top-level disk, "Apple SSD", and selected "Repair", and after ~2 seconds it said something like "OK". I don't have an option to click on "Repair" when I click on any of the partitions.  I haven't used any third-party software, using emonly/em Disk Utility for its own purpose, and haven't touched the Windows partition.  emPlease/em, can someone tell me how to get my Windows partition booting once again.  I've since removed the empty partition which I had cerated, merging it back into the Macintosh HD partition.

There are a couple of guys on here [...in the world!...] who have the skill to fix this. I hope they pick up your case. Wish you luck. <comment370359> Please tell us you had a full backup before you started .... <comment370360> Yes, I have backups of both OSs. But I'm a freelancer/contractor and this hiccup means I can't work. It'll take at least a full day to get everything back to where I was so I'm desperately hoping someone can tell me how to set that partition as bootable once again. <comment370362> That at least is a good position to be in with the backups - hope you get a solution
