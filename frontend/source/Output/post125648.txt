Preview cannot be closed unless it has focus <body> strongMy Environment:/strong  ul liMac OS X Mavericks 10.9.2/li liMac Pro 2 x 2.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon/li li32 GB Memory/li /ul  strongProblem:/strong  I tried to illustrate the problem using the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0r8hr.png" alt="enter image description here"  In Mac OS X 10.8.5, I could close Preview while the windows are in this position. In Mavericks, two clicks are required to close Preview: the first click does nothing, the second closes Preview.  strongQuestion:/strong  Is there a way to configure Mavericks to revert to the old behavior?  Thank you!  <comment147042> Inserting! is it only in preview? <comment147050> @Buscar웃 it seems to only be happening with Preview. What's "inserting"? Thanks! <comment147055> I'm on 10.9.2 also and just set up the same situation, Safari window on top of Preview window and clicking on the x closed the window. I think @Buscar웃 meant "Interesting!" but I'm not certain. <comment147091> I noticed similar behavior, but with scrolling. Two-finger drag in Preview does not always work in 10.9 unless the window is on top. But sometimes it does; I've been unable to figure out when. This is new in Mavericks.
