Don't sync certain password with iCloud <body> Is there any way to specify that a certain password should not be synced to iCloud?  Use case:     I am allowed to have internet only on one mac address. So I use it on my laptop, but the password is synced to iCloud and so iPad also joins the network (which it cannot use as there is mac protection). Can I restrict that password to be available only on the Mac?   <answer223646> So if you look in the emKeychain Access/em, there is a "Keychain" column, and initially your password ends up in both emSystem/em and emiCloud/em keychains. You should delete the emiCloud/em entry, this will remove the password form the other devices, but the one with emSystem/em will stay and will be used by your machine  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EK4yX.png" alt="enter image description here"
