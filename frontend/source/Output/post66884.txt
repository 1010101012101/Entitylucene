How can I hide **some** birthdays in iOS Calendar? <body> I have entered the birthday for several of my Contacts, and these birthdays show up in Calendar. I know that I can enable or disable strongall/strong birthdays by selecting or deslecting "Birthdays" from Show Calendars in the top corner of the Calendar app.  But I only want to see strongsome/strong of my contact's birthdays in the Calendar; for example, personal contacts but not ex-coworkers.    How can I prevent the display of certain birthdays?  <answer66898> You could edit out the birthdate information from those contacts you do not want to see in the Birthdays calendar.  Another way to accomplish this would be by manually adding the birthdays you strongdo/strong want to see to a new or existing calendar and then disable the Birthdays subscription.  <answer235979> As a compromise, you can disable the notification for that person's birthday. In calendar, double click on the birthday even and then change the alert to none. You will then be prompted if you want to change this event or all future events. Select all future events and you will no longer receive notifications for that birthday. It will however remain in your birthday calendar, but you will no longer be pestered with reminders (which is what I came her looking for before figuring out I could disable the reminder)  <answer271028> I modified the script to be as follows:  precode(*  This script iterates over your contacts. For each contact, it will delete the contact that has the birthdays *)   tell application "Contacts"     set peopleToChange to people whose (birth date) is not missing value     repeat with thePerson in peopleToChange         delete ((birth date) of thePerson)     end repeat     save end tell /code/pre  <comment79451> Moving the birthday into the notes for that person is what I have done so far.  I do wish there were a way to enable or disable birthdays by a contact's group. <comment93688> I agree that there should be a checkbox option for whether or not to display a birthday or other date in my calendar.
