How do I show all hidden & invisible files on the command line (both .files and invisible flagged files)? <body> Is there a way to show only the hidden and invisible files in a directory using the command line?  For instance codels -a | grep "^\."/code will show all the files hidden by a period as the first character, but what about files hidden with the invisible flag or listed in .hidden (mostly deprecated in practice, don't worry about that one so much.)?  <answer93505> If the files are indexed by Spotlight and files in subdirectories can be included, you could use mdfind:  precodemdfind kMDItemFSInvisible=1 -onlyin . /code/pre  Or test for both GetFileInfo -av (attribute invisible) and if the name starts with a period:  precodeshopt -s dotglob nullglob for f in *; do [[ $(GetFileInfo -av "$f") = 1 || $f = .* ]] &amp;&amp; echo "$f"; done /code/pre  GetFileInfo is part of the command line tools package that can be downloaded from Xcode's preferences or from developer.apple.com/downloads.  Different ways to list only files that start with a period:  precodeshopt -s nullglob; printf %s\\n .[^.]* ..?* shopt -s dotglob nullglob; GLOBIGNORE='. ..'; printf %s\\n * ls -a | grep -E '^(\.[^.]|\.\.[^$])' /code/pre
