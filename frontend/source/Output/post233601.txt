How can I make ipad Safari bookmark list wider? <body> How can I make ipad Safari bookmark list wider ?  I want to see as much text as possible for each bookmark, not have more than half the screen devoted to a dimmed-out web page.  iPad Air 2, iOS 9.3.1   See picture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YOA1i.jpg" alt="Example Picture of problem"  When you choose larger text sizes, the default value doesn't allow for much text to show.  <answer233617> There is no way to make it wider without a jailbreak.  The only thing you can do is to make the text smaller so you can see more of it.  That stinks but it's the only thing available.
