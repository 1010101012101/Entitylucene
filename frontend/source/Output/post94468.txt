Method for using F4 key without pressing function button on MacBook Pro <body> I'm using a program that uses the kbdF4/kbd key as an important shortcut which I use heavily.  Every time I want to press kbdF4/kbd on my MacBook Pro also have to press the kbdfn/kbd button.  Is there a possibility (such as with an AppleScript?) that something could detect if I'm using that program and allow me to avoid pressing kbdfn/kbd and let me use the shortcut just with the kbdF4/kbd key?  <answer94469> The "Use all F1..." method is probably the best way to go. It'll be mildly inconvenient in other applications, but it may make sense for your use case.  <answer94484> h2Palua/h2  Palua lets you change emall/em function keys for emindividual/em apps.     With Palua, you just need one click - or one hotkey - to toggle the mode your Fx keys are.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kz4tU.jpg" alt="Palua Smart Mode"  h2FunctionFlip/h2  FunctionFlip can 'flip' emcertain/em function keys only instead of changing all keys, but it works for emall/em apps.     FunctionFlip individually controls your MacBook or MacBook Pro's function keys, turning special keys back to regular F-keys, or vice-versa.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRfMP.png" alt="FunctionFlip"     FunctionFlip's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you "flip" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back. That is, the "special" and "normal" functions are flipped.   <answer94520> You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;appdef&gt;     &lt;appname&gt;TEXTEDIT&lt;/appname&gt;     &lt;equal&gt;com.apple.TextEdit&lt;/equal&gt;   &lt;/appdef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;flipf4&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;flipf4&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;only&gt;TEXTEDIT&lt;/only&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, KeyCode::F4&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <answer126607> Very simple:  ol liClick Apple at the top left of the Mac Menu/li liClick "System Preferences..."/li liSelect the Keyboard Icon/li liCheck the "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard key functions"./li /ol  <answer275339> How about using the default Excel for Mac shortcut?  kbd⌘/kbd + kbdY/kbd  <comment110751> Have you tried going into "System Preferences  Keyboard" and checking the box next to "Use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys"? <comment111275> sorry but how can I insert this xml snippet? <comment111310> Save it as `~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml`, open KeyRemap4MacBook, press the Reload XML button, and select the checkbox for the setting. <comment113262> it does not work.. I think I am not able to specify the application.. it is "Qt Creator", and it is located in: /Applications/Qt\ Creator.app <comment113263> It worked for me when I changed the bundle identifier to org.qt-project.qtcreator. You could try disabling other applications or kernel extensions, or test if KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD is shown in EventViewer.app, or test if predefined settings like this work. <comment113273> holy god. thank you it works with `org.qt-project.qtcreator` identifier <comment113276> and for F2? I've tried to add those 2 lines `__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, KeyCode::F2/autogen     __KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP /autogen` but nothing.. <comment113277> Try KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_BRIGHTNESS_UP instead. <comment148343> This overrides all function keys at all times for every program, the OP really needs it just to work on F4, and even then just for that one App if possible
