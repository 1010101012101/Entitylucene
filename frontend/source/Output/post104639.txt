Can I map a character to a different key? <body> I am using a British IBM model M keyboard with Mountain Lion. I have selected the "British - PC" input source and it is working well, except for one key: the pipe.  If you consider what is printed on the key-caps to be correct then the keyboard is mapped correctly, but there is one difference to what my muscle-memory expects and how the keyboard works in Linux.  The key with the "¦" symbol (a "broken pipe"?) on it lies immediately to the right of the left-shift key. I am used to getting a "|" symbol (the "pipe") if I use this key with the "Shift" key.  The key with the "|" symbol is the one immediately to the left of the number 1 key. It emits a "|" symbol when used with the "Alt" key.  Now, I would like to press the key immediately to the right of the left-shift key (marked "¦") and to get a pipe "|" output when used with the "Shift" key.  I have tried using the OSX "symbol and text substitution" feature and this works, except it does not work in the terminal (which is the only place I really need to use this symbol).  So, how can I change the keyboard mapping so that the "¦" key emits a "|" character ?  <answer104661> Edit: I didn't notice that you were already using the British - PC input source.  You can flip the  code`/code and code\/code keys (code§/code and code`/code in the Mac British keyboard layout) by using a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BACKQUOTE, KeyCode::UK_SECTION&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::UK_SECTION, KeyCode::BACKQUOTE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <answer278214> strongRevisiting this four years later, now with macOS Sierra./strong  If you have a non-Apple keyboard then you may want to use a more appropriate keyboard mapping. You can select keyboard mappings through the emkeyboard/em tab of the emSystem Preferences/em dialog. Select emInput Sources/em and use the code+/code button to select a mapping appropriate for your keyboard. (You may also need to use the code-/code button to delete the mapping that you do not wish to use before your chosen mapping becomes fully effective.)  If you find the mappings provided by Apple to be unsatisfactory (Apple's emBritish - PC/em keyboard does not map the pipe to the correct key - adjacent to the left-hand emshift/em key) then you may install third-party layouts or create your own.  Here is a ZIP file containing two alternative layouts files for UK 105 key keyboards. You should unzip the files into code/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code (use codesudo/code).  The new layouts won't be available in the abovementioned emInput Sources/em until you log out and back in. After that, you can select them like any other layout (they may be listed in the emothers/em category).  You can edit your chosen layout if it is still unsatisfactory (I chose the emBritish (PC 105 alt)/em layout but found that codeAlt+3/code emitted cent (¢) instead of the expected Euro (€) symbol). Layout files are simple XML text files. I identified the relevant emkey code/em and replaced its unicode codeoutput/code character:  precode&lt;key code="21" output="&amp;#xA2;" /&gt; /code/pre  with  precode&lt;key code="21" output="&amp;#x20AC;" /&gt; /code/pre  (The change was applied in two places: keymap index 3, for emanyOption/em key (codeAlt/code to PC keyboard users), and keymap index 5 for the same with emCapsLock/em on.)  (Once again, a log out/in cycle is required for the change to take effect).  The emkey code/em for the code4/code key (which, when used with codeAlt/code should produce code€/code) is 21. Should you wish to discover the key code for a physical key then you could use the Key Codes app, available free of charge from the Apple App Store.   Should you desire a more GUI way of customising your keyboard then you could look at Ukelele [sic] or Karabiner, formerly known as emKeyRemap4MacBook/em (although the website states that emKarabiner doesn't currently work on macOS Sierra at the moment/em.)  hr  strongStill unresolved/strong I wanted to identify keycodes without installing anything (think emX-Windows/em codexev/code) and I could not find Apple's standard key layouts (they aren't in code/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code). I guess they are in code/System/Library/Keyboard Layouts/code in a different format. It would be nice to be able to use a standard layout as a starting point for custom edits made as described above.  <comment123139> Didn't he say that he had already selected the British - PC layout? <comment123146> If you are actually using the British - PC input source provided by Apple, then the pipe symbol should indeed be located at the key you want.  Are you using some other input source with the same name provide by someone else? <comment123298> as far as I know I am using the "British - PC" input source provided by Apple. <comment123299> I'll have a look at this. Is there not a native way to do this (i.e. without installing another app) ? <comment123324> I think you need a special layout.  See if any of those at this site help:  http://liyang.hu/osx-british.xhtml <comment123372> @starfry You could also [create a custom keylayout file](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/97552/). <comment123438> @Lauri -- how is it possible that the British Model M does not obey the Apple British-PC keylayout regardless of what is printed on the keys.  Does it return non-standard codes? <comment350121> Regarding your "still unresolved", Ukelele provides many of the standard layouts with its download, and also has a menu item "File  New From Current Input Source."  It is really a lot easier and more reliable to use its gui to make mapping changes than trying to edit the xml files.
