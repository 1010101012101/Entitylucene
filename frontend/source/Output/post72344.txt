do I need so many "mail folders to push"? <body> All,  In the mail settings of my iPhone 4 running iOS 6.0.1, I've configured my Mail/Exchange to "Mail Folders to Push strongemInbox + 10"/em/strong. These 10 folders sync with the same folders I have in my MS Outlook 2010. They are Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted Items, FH (my initials), Client Name 1, Client Name 2 etc, etc.  All of my mail goes into my Inbox. From there, I move mail to the appropriate folder/mailbox. So if I get an email from Client 1, and if it's important, I move it into the Client 1 folder.   Do I need to have my iPhone set up to push mail into these various folders/mailboxes since all mail goes into my inbox only?  Thanks-FH
