Tab completion for hosts defined in ~/.ssh/config doesn't work anymore on Yosemite <body> I'm trying to create my code~/.ssh/config/code file for simplify my work life on the server connection.  In Mavericks all worked properly and with the kbdtab/kbd I was be able to autocomplete the hostname with file like this:  precodeHost test-host-name     HostName 192.168.1.2     User root /code/pre  The same configuration on Yosemite have a different behavior. When I type codessh t/code on the shell the kbdtab/kbd does not autocomplete the hostname.  Do someone know if is something changed in Yosemite and now I need to do something to make it work?   <answer168168> I assume the shell of your Mac is bash.  You need to complete ssh command, for more detail you can read codeman complete/code  precode_complete_ssh_hosts () {         COMPREPLY=()         cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"         comp_ssh_hosts=`cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts | \                         cut -f 1 -d ' ' | \                         sed -e s/,.*//g | \                         grep -v ^# | \                         uniq | \                         grep -v "\[" ;                 cat ~/.ssh/config | \                         grep "^Host " | \                         awk '{print $2}'                 `         COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${comp_ssh_hosts}" -- $cur))         return 0 } complete -F _complete_ssh_hosts ssh /code/pre  Don't forget you need to codesource/code the file to get the new command to load in your terminal. or You can put this code in .bash_profile  <answer209269> You can enable bash shell completion by installing codebash-completion/code via brew:  precodebrew install bash-completion brew tap homebrew/completions /code/pre  Then add the following to your code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodeif [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion fi /code/pre  Source  <answer232873> From this article on MacWorld.  Copy/paste the following into code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodecomplete -o default -o nospace -W "$(/usr/bin/env ruby -ne 'puts $_.split(/[,\s]+/)[1..-1].reject{|host| host.match(/\*|\?/)} if $_.match(/^\s*Host\s+/);' &lt; $HOME/.ssh/config)" scp sftp ssh /code/pre  You'll then need to either restart your terminal or type codesource ~/.bash_profile/code (note that the latter will only work in your current tab).  <answer256707> FYI, I'm not sure how to respond directly to nelson's answer since I haven't built up enough reputation to comment on it yet, but on my machine running El Capitan, code^M/code was being appended to all of the host names from my config file.  I had to either add code\r/code to my code$IFS/code variable or remove/substitute all instances of code\r/code from the output of the second codecat/code.  In the end, I did the latter by adding codetr '\r' '\n'/code to make that command chain look like this:  precodecat ~/.ssh/config | \         grep "^Host " | \         awk '{print $2}' | \         tr '\r' '\n' /code/pre  <comment197295> Yep, the shell is bash. Why in Maveriks I didn't need to do this things? <comment197299> No, I've tested just now. I can't do that in Mavericks by default.
