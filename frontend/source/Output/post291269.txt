iTunes Shared Library missing artist artwork <body> When accessing an iTunes library shared over the local network, why do the usual artist images not appear? The album artwork appears just fine.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HcMFW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295090> This problem is seen in all iTunes versions after 12.4. It doesn't depend on a local network. Apple will not help you or anyone.  <comment372468> HI, and welcome to StackExchange!
