How can I automate recurrent steps in Yosemite? <body> I have a set of URLs bookmarked in chrome and I do many times a day:    ul liOpen Chrome  /li liOpen bookmarks  /li liSearch a specific bookmark among my folders  /li liClick on bookmark   /li /ul  Is there a way to do these actions automatically?  I see that if I press kbdCommand/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd the "Spotlight search" searches in my Mail but I can't see how can I create something like what I need.    Do I need to install some other application?  <answer207642> h1AppleScript and Automator/h1  AppleScript and Automator are your best starting points for automating OS X. Both are included in OS X, so there is no immediate need to install third party software.  AppleScript and Automator are complementary approaches. An Automator workflow can include AppleScript snippets. An AppleScript can trigger Automator workflows.  See Introduction to AppleScript and AppleScript: The Language of Automation for an introduction to AppleScript. You can experiment with AppleScript using the included strongScript Editor.app/strong utility included in your strongApplications  Utilities/strong folder.  Searching the web for codeapplescript chrome/code will return many useful web sites, such as:  ul liScripting Google Chrome for OSX using AppleScript/li liGoogle Chrome meets AppleScript/li liUse AppleScript to open current Safari URL in Google Chrome/li /ul  When you reach the limits of AppleScript and Automator, third party automation software is available.  <comment250498> 1) Why would I need to learn a scripting language if there are free third party apps that do this? 2) The software you are linking is not free <comment250499> Is it not possible to do this with a free app? <comment250500> Not all software is free and not all software will do exactly what you need. Learning a scripting language will allow you to go beyond the capabilities of any individual piece of software. OS X's **AppleScript is free** and an excellent way to combine applications and create workflows. <comment250506> I see I can open chrome from the CMD+SPACE. To open it on a specific URL I must use apple script? I am trying to understand what I can or can not do by default <comment250523> I'd say Automator is much easier to learn for a beginner, especially if it's just this one job.
