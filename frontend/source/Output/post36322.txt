iPhoto opens with spinning beach ball and won't stop <body> My daughter's MacBook Pro has a problem with iPhoto. Just get a spinning wheel after opening. I've tried deleting and reloading from time capsule backups when it did work. That didnt work. Anyone have any ideas?  <answer36357> I advise that you try creating a new iPhoto library by following the instructions on this Apple Support page.  <answer36358> Try holding the kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd key when launching iPhoto and rebuild your library.  <answer36363> In case the above answers do not work or if you want to try something a little easier first, try moving the iPhoto plist file to the Desktop.  You can find it in code~/Library/Preferences/code. It should have the name codecom.apple.iPhoto.plist/code. If you are running Lion, you will need to move the codecom.apple.iPhoto.plist.lockfile/code file as well. Try moving these to the Desktop and reopening the application. If that does not resolve the issue, put the codeplist/code files back and move on to the other suggestions.   <comment41379> Is it attempting to do face recognition? <comment41442> I don't think it is doing face recognition. <comment41513> This worked great! Thanks for your insight. <comment99421> Is the spinning problem resolved? Can we do something else to help?
