Third Party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI Cables <body> curious if anyone has any experience with any third party Mini Display Port to VGA or DVI cables? I noticed the cables on emebay/em selling for around $16. Compared to the strongofficial/strong cables that run for around $35 seems like a bargin. Wasn't sure if the quality is the same or if anyone has any experience with buying them. Thanks!  <answer7149> Most third-party cables will work perfectly.  In particular, any cables which are digital should perform exactly as their more expensive counterparts.  I've personally used a couple of third party cables which worked without issue.  I bought a Mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable when the MacBook Pro 13" Unibody first came out from www.circuitassembly.com and it's great quality and was cheap too  <answer7150> The cables from Monoprice.com have recently changed so they're not shaped as nicely as before, but the quality is still excellent for the price. 6ft cable for $10 shipped.  http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&amp;cp_id=10246&amp;cs_id=1024604&amp;p_id=5999&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2  The picture isn't faithful to what you'll receive as the Mini Display Port male plug is now a bit bulkier. Still works flawlessly though.  <answer7173> We got several mini-display port to DVI, VGA and HDMI cables from http://www.meritline.com/ and they work great.  In particular, they have a mini-displayport to hdmi, dvi and displayport (all in one) dongle.  <answer86241> A cheap knockoff Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter in I bought on eBay for $7 worked pretty well, but caused a strange problem on my rMBP. Occasionally, when using it, my Wi-Fi would cut out, and switching to an Apple adapter fixed the issue.  I tested this six ways to Sunday, and the cheap adapter was definitely the consistent factor. It's a weird issue, but apparently I'm not the only one.  <comment7622> Cool, thanks for the link! <comment7623> No worries, I just updated the link to point to the Mini DisplayPort section since that's what you're interested in ;o) <comment7624> Yeah, definitely not shaped as nicely. The ones I found on eBay looked identical to the Apple version (I was fooled until I read the small text). The price can't be beat though! Thanks for the response.
