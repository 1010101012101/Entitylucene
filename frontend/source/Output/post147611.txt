Disk Utility will not let me create new partition <body> I am attempting to create a new partition from a 3TB Fusion Drive on Mavericks, but Disk Utility won't allow it. I successfully created a partition from the same drive last month, so I am not sure why it won't allow me to create another one. Does this have something to do with the Fusion Drive? Is there a workaround?   Thank you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFfjN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer147669> It looks like you partition the whole drive to be the Mac drive.

Drag the slider between the partitions to size as desired. Set a name for the 2nd partition. Apply. Clone your system back to the new Boot volume (if too large, move some items first to the new 2nd volume). Copy your other data (data not going onto the Boot volume) onto the 2nd volume. Set the startup volume to the new Boot volume, reboot. /code/pre  <comment174002> So what happens when you click on the + sign ? <comment174049> Nothing.
