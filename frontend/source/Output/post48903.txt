How to open a .lwp file on a Mac? <body> I need to fill in a form that was sent to me in .lwp format... So far:  ul liThe App Store couldn't find any compatible apps;/li liI found out it's a Lotus WordPro document;/li liBy using Word's Recover text from any file, the content is all messed up;/li liI don't have access to a PC to use WordPort nor Kvlotus.exe;/li liI read the solution is to install IBM Lotus Symphony.../li /ul  ...but before I download a 250MB+ package and install it for a one time thing, did anyone here face the same problem just to come to a more elegant solution to convert this file to a more useful format?  hr  emLater edit:/em installing strongSymphony doesn't support it/strong either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KRfnF.png" alt="Open .lwp file in IBM Lotus Symphony for Mac" title="Open .lwp file in IBM Lotus Symphony for Mac"  So my question remains: how do you use a strong.lwp/strong file on a Mac?  <answer52438> LibreOffice version 3.3 and later has a Lotus WordPro import filter (see screenshot here: http://www.libreoffice.org/download/3-3-new-features-and-fixes/).
