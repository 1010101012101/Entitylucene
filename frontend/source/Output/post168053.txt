Boot bitlocker enabled Windows 8.1 bootcamp via VMWare? <body> Hardware: Macbook Pro Retina 15" 2014  OSX:  Yosemite 10.10.1 with Fusion 7.1  Windows: Windows 8.1 Update 1 x64 on a bootcamp partition with Windows Bitlocker (full disk encryption) enabled. Bitlocker takes a password from keyboard at the Windows bootup screen.  I want to add that bootcamp partition from within Fusion 7.1, so I can fire it up, enter my bitlocker password inside the VM and run Windows.  How do I do this?  <comment256029> have you tried analog to this answer to just do / encrypt it after setting up the Fusion on Bootcamp? ;) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31021420  P.S: http://superuser.com/questions/493777 here is someone saying "bitlocker is not supported in VM"?! sounds strange to me
