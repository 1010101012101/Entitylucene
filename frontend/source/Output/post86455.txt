How to create a symbolic link with Quicksilver? <body> Quicksilver has a "Make Alias in..." action but this creates a hard link.  Is there any way, including plugins, to create a symbolic link?  <answer112319> Best is to use an automator (service) you can call with QuickSilver…  The service receives "strongfiles or folder/strong" in "strongFinder.app/strong" You then add a "Run AppleScript" action with the following code (that you might want to tweak a little) :  precode    on run {input, parameters}      tell application "Finder"         repeat with i in input             if class of i is not folder then                 set p to POSIX path of ((container of i) as text)             else                 set p to POSIX path of (i as text)             end if             if p is equal to "/" OR p is equal to "/Volumes/" then                 set p to POSIX path of (path to desktop folder) &amp; (name of i as text)             else                 set p to (p &amp; (name of i as text) &amp; "_SymLink")             end if             set i to POSIX path of (i as text) -- to debug : --          display dialog "ln -s '" &amp; i &amp; "' '" &amp; p &amp; "'"             do shell script "ln -s '" &amp; i &amp; "' '" &amp; p &amp; "'"         end repeat     end tell      return true end run /code/pre  <answer112323> It's in the Core Support plugin, but disabled by default — it's pretty "low-level" stuff. You should check your Actions preferences, sort the list by plugin, select Core Support and they should be there.   strongEdit:/strong Added my comment as it was a better answer ;-).  How you did it should have worked — I've tried it just now and it works as expected (though you might check that both actions are enabled in the Actions preference since they are disabled by default).  I think you might have held ⌘ while executing, because "Make Hard Link In..." is set as the alternate action for "Make Link In...", and alternate actions where pretty "ghostly" a few versions ago — now you can see them as soon as you press ⌘.  <comment132005> I don't have "Make Hard Link In..." or "Make Link In...".  Are you using a plugin for this? <comment132011> It's in the Core Support plugin, but disabled by default — it's pretty "low-level" stuff.

If you'll post this as an answer, I'll select it.  Thanks!
