Mail from Outlook prints tiny when received by Mac Mail client <body> I'm using current version of MS Outlook on a new MacBook Pro with font set to Calibri 11pt.  When my colleagues who use Mac Mail receive my emails and print them, the font appears tiny--way too small. If I increase my font size, it looks ridiculous on screen.  How do we solve this so that they can read and print my emails, seeing font at normal size? Thanks!
