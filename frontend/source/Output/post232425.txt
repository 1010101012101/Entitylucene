How to fix Final Cut Pro X's "Modified File" message <body> Final Cut Pro (FCP) X 10.2.3 today gave me the most unhelpful warning message in my timeline: "Modified File" - thanks Final Cut Pro! What can I do to fix this problem?  I've tried relinking the clips, Googling just lead to more questions and no solutions. Anyone have a clue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dUDPb.jpg" alt="Modified File"  <answer232426> Apple's Final Cut Pro X: Alert icons support document says only:     strongModified File/strong : A media file has been changed by an application other than Final Cut Pro.   Have you tried recreating the optimised media and proxy files? The following YouTube tutorials appear to suggest this for the Modified Files problem:  ul liModified File Error | Final Cut Pro X | Tutorial (Spanish narration with screen recording)/li liFCPX: Relink Missing Projects and Events from an External Hard Drive/li /ul  <answer262970> Open the finder window and find the photo.  Drag it into the timeline to replace the "Modified" image and it should reappear.   Good Luck.  <comment283995> Yes, I tried recreating the optimized media. The first youtube video is in Spanish btw... and I'm not using proxy media, though the entire project and event are stored on an external HD <comment284025> Do you use other software to modify or edit footage? Any guess at what might have caused the file to change from FCP's perspective? Do you have a Time Machine back-up you could restore to? <comment284078> Nope, I just use FCP... And no, it's 4K footage on an external RAID, there is no time machine
