Need help with update to latest Git using Terminal <body> I was trying to update to the latest Git version in my Terminal. I've no clue what I did and all I remember was that I removed the previous installed Git I think because when i run the following commands:  precodewhich git =&gt; /usr/local/bin/git git --version =&gt; -bash: /usr/bin/git: No such file or directory brew install git =&gt; Warning: git-2.2.1 already installed brew doctor =&gt; Your system is ready to brew. brew link git =&gt; Warning: Already linked: /usr/local/Cellar/git/2.2.1 $PATH =&gt; "/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:‌​/usr/sbin:/sbin" /code/pre  My question is what should i do next so that I can use Git ?  <answer162596> I suspect that git's location is still cached in code/usr/bin/code (the default location). To check this, type:  precodetype git /code/pre  The result will likely be:  precodegit is hashed (/usr/bin/git) /code/pre  To fix this, you can simply log out &amp; back in, or clear the hash for git with the following:  precodehash -d git /code/pre  Now, running git should work properly.  <comment201469> I spent literally half an hour working on this, nowhere else was the hashing mentioned. Thank you!
