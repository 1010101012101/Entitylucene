Can I disable Mac sleep mode even when lid is closed? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there any way to set a MacBook Pro to not sleep when you close the lid?       I have a Macbook Pro (early 2011) with Mountain Lion installed.   Is there a way to prevent my Mac from going to sleep even on lid close?  <answer76833> If you have an external monitor plugged in, it will happen automatically.  Otherwise, you can use InsomniaX.  <comment232120> cmdline equivalent is: `caffeinate` since `pmset noidle` is deprecated in favor of caffeinate (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html)
