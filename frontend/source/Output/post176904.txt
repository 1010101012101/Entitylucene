4 gb video file not visible in PC <body> I recorded a video of 4.5 GB and able to play on Ipad 8.1,3. but when I tranfer it to PC with feem it is not playing and when I browse videos on PC with data cable , that 4 GB file is not present.  what would be the problem.  Edit:  File format is .MOV  <comment209028> what is the file format (extension) <comment209029> file format is .MOV <comment209030> do you have QuickTime app on the Windows PC?or how do you expect it to play? <comment209034> I don't have quick time..but the other video's recorded in same ipad were visible and able to play in vlc or WMP, <comment209036> i installed quick time now..but no luck. <comment209045> What version of Windows and how is your hard drive formatted? FAT-formatted hard drives cannot handle files over 2GB in size, so it may not actually have transferred the whole file. <comment209087> @tubedogg, How many user are still running Windows on FAT? Windows started using FAT32 nearly 20 years ago and it supports up to 4 GB files size, however kpvsrkp said the file was 4.5 GB so obviously if the Windows filesystem he dropped it on isn't NTFS the file is not going to be copied properly, if at all. <comment209180> @user3439894 ...hence my question. It could be a FAT-formatted external drive. The PS3, for example, requires external drives that are FAT (not FAT32) formatted. I realize he said Windows but that doesn't mean the drive isn't used for other purposes too. <comment209184> @tubedogg, kpvsrkp said "but when I tranfer it to PC with feem" and so assuming Windows since "PC" typically means "Windows" unless stated otherwise and using [Feem Wi-Fi](http://www.tryfeem.com/en/download.html), the point is unless the filesystem saved to supports greater then 4 GB, since the file is 4.5 GB, it all a moot issue until kpvsrkp provides appropriate information. :)
