Is there a complete and detailed description of what Migration Assistant copies over? <body> Does it copy all files in ~/Library ?  Including cache files and even things like Flash cookies?  What about user created files/folders in / ?  etc etc  <answer15265> Migration Assistant is fairly well documented in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4413 - basically if a newer or equivalent version of a file is not present, it gets moved by default.  In your case ~/Library is moved if you select that user - you can't deselect it like some other folders in the home folder.  Applications (which includes /Library/Application support as well as /Applications) move when that is selected.  Files in / only move if you choose other files. Everything goes AFAIK. Even ByHost preferences that no longer are used since the host has changed.  <answer15396> The Migration Assistant will write to the logs, like every other application and service. Please see your logs for these details: code/Library/Logs/SystemMigration.log/code  <comment108825> nothing there for me, on Mountain Lion - I could find it under `/private/var/log/system.log` tho, marked with **Sender** as `MigrateTool`
