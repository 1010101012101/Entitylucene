Touch and hold the globe key on your keyboard to change back to your Apple localized keyboard.   You could also disable autocorrect in the companion app for your custom keyboard, in your case the SwiftKey app.   <comment367856> Hi John - have you tried long-pressing on the emoji button and disabling autocorrect from there? Also, could you please update your question with your iOS version? <comment367899> @Jackson1442 Thank you. The problem was that i was using the Swift key. Once I switched to English(US) just as you recommended, the problem is solved. THANK YOU
