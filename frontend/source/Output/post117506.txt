Can Super Duper perform "smart update" from SSD to HDD? <body> My goal is to create a bootable backup of my SSD boot drive on an external HDD. I'm using a Mac Pro mid-2010, so I can swap out the boot drive should my SSD ever get corrupted. Is there any reason Super Duper wouldn't be able to "smart update" a clone of the SSD onto an HDD? (And should I consider alternatives to Super Duper?)  <answer117661> SuperDuper can do this. I've done it with a MacBook before. As far as SuperDuper is concerned, it's just two drives.   <answer118026> emFrom the developer:/em      Of course. THere's nothing special about SSDs from a file perspective - they work just like HDDs.
