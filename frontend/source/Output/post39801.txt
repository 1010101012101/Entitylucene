I Can connect Mac OS Lion to Win 7 via cable but not via wireless...help! <body> I have a macbook pro, and netgear n600 modem/router (DGND3700) and a win7 PC that is working nicely with homegroup networking.  when I plug the macbook into the router via a network cable I can 'connect to server...' and get the the win7 shares just fine. but when I try whilst using wireless it refuses to connect.  What should I tweak to make it work? I assume its a problem with the mac because other non-mac computers can see the shares on my win7 box just fine via wireless.   <answer40197> When i connect on a 2.6Ghz range rather than 5Ghz it works. so its probably that the netgear router (or the macbook) is not supporting ipv6 properly on the 5Ghz range.  <comment45052> can you Ping or traceroute the windows machine from the Mac when the Mac is attached to Wifi? <comment45058> no...I just get a timeout. <comment45449> I doubt it's IPV6 related, more than likely a routing or Wifi-to-LAN protection set up on that interface.  If none of the Windows machines are using the 5Ghz interface, I'd compare the settings and see what is different. <comment45547> As it happens the windows laptop isn't connecting on 5Ghz so there must be something different in the config on the router between 2.4 and 5
