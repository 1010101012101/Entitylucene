Device name on router is different than OS X hostname <body> There are tons of questions about changing a Mac hostname, and while I went through most of them, I could never find this nuanced answer:  Why do routers always seems to receive the first hostname that was ever set to a machine? Let me show you with these screenshots how this Mac is supposedly correctly setup according to various answers on this site:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A3jp6.png" alt="System Preferences showing Sharing settings" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7xR3.png" alt="Terminal showing hostname informations"  Now, when i set up this computer years ago, I think I chose the hostname codedavid-MBP/code, and this seems to be what various routers get to this day and sometimes return to the Mac for localhost operations. Later I changed it with the various Terminal commands, and the Mac knows it, but it seems to stick around when communicating with routers.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IDVPv.png" alt="Router configuration with erroneous settings"  So now my question is where do OS X keep this old value? strongBecause since I connected with this router in the screenshot above, I never had that hostname, so it's no DHCP cache or anything like that./strong  <comment255695> Did the host *david-macbook-pro* ever have the name *david-MBP*? <comment255699> Yes, I wrote it a bit contorted: when i set up the Mac, I did use that host name. Over the course of time, I changed it numerous times with any common command, and on the machine it changed. But the one that get read by routers really seems to stick. <comment255701> So it's not a OS X problem but one of the router OS (probably some Linux descendant). Once the hostname is set the router doesn't update it properly in its hosts database! <comment255702> My last point in the question though is that this router met my Mac like a month or so ago, but my Mac has been in this setup for months/years. So there is some setting somewhere in OS X lurking around. <comment255705> Check your nvram with `nvram -p | grep david` <comment255706> `~ $ nvram -p | grep david` `~ $ nvram -p | grep David` `fmm-mobileme-token-FMM [REDACTED]` `fmm-computer-name David's MacBook Pro` <comment257659> 30/10/15 00:03:38,651 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: uid=0 30/10/15 00:03:38,651 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: init request 30/10/15 00:03:38,659 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: init return domain: MACBOOKPRO-7BF4 server: DAVID-MACBOOK-PRO indomain was: NULL 30/10/15 00:03:38,695 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: uid=0 30/10/15 00:03:38,695 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: init request 30/10/15 00:03:38,703 digest-service[10487]: digest-request: init return domain: DAVID-MBP server: DAVID-MACBOOK-PRO indomain was: NULL <comment257660> I guess this has something to do with Kerberos… <comment257677> http://cl.ly/image/3X372E0G1t1K  Whenever I connect to a specific router, my hostname on the machine gets changed to the "old" one. I really have no idea why! I try to change it but nothing. It's like a central DNS is assigning me a hostname that got labeled to my MAC, maybe…
