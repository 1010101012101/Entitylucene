Extract .zip directly to external hard drive <body> I have a huge .zip which extracted takes up to 100 GB, and storing that amount of data on my MBP's SSD is not an option.   Is there a way to extract a zip file directly to an external hard drive, without filling up the MBP's SSD?  I tried copying the .zip to the external drive I have and extracting it from there, but it gets unzipped in the Downloads folder.  Does anybody know how to achieve this?  Thank you for your time.  <answer197167> If you open Terminal, you can use the codeunzip/code command.  precodeunzip /path/to/the/archive.zip -d /Volumes/target_location/ /code/pre  (To type these paths, you can just drag the file/folder into the Terminal window.)  <answer197168> Open Terminal.app  cd to the zip file:  precodecd /Path/to/directory_containing_zip/ /code/pre  then enter   precodeunzip filename.zip -d /Path/to/folder/on/external/drive /code/pre  With -d you may determine an optional directory to which to extract files.  <answer197171> If you are comfortable with the command line (via Terminal ), cd to the directory you are interested in   cd /Volumes/your-external-drive  If it is from an internet source, use curl or wget to pull done the file  wget http://my-data/data.zip  this will bypass the default action (like unzipping upon download)   and unzip the file  unzip data.zip  Each command has extra options which man which help with. For example  man wget  which will describe all the details  <answer197173> h1Terminal (Hackers way)/h1  Open the codeTerminal.app/code  (Hidden in Applications - Utilities - Terminal) and Navigate with codecd/code to your Folder where the zip file is stored.   Example:  precodecd ~/Desktop/ /code/pre  And extract the ZIP file with the OSX command line tool codeunzip/code  precodeunzip /path/to/the/archive.zip -d /Volumes/USB_Drive/ /code/pre  the code-d/code switch let you set the extraction Archive - the second path is your external HDD - you may have to change the name codeUSB_Drive/code (Tipp: Type /Volumes/ and the hit the codeTab/code-Key twice to see all Volumes.   h1Software/h1  h3Keka/h3  I know the Software codeKea.app/code where you can specify in the Setting a custom folder for the extracted folders.   h3StuffitExpander/h3  Also codeStuffitExpander/code will let you choose for every extraction the location in a Finder Window  I hope it helps - and happy extracting    <comment235692> Try keka at http://www.kekaosx.com or the App Store (not free there, though). <comment235700> Actually not the Answer for this Question ... the Question is only about extracting and not downloading and bypass the auto extraction.
