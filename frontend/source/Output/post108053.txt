Were there changes to AppStore 'password caching' in iOS 7? <body> Ever since I updated my iPad mini to iOS 7, my son (4 y.o.) has been making sneaky in-app purchases. What's worse is he emknows/em how he's doing it, but won't spill the beans when I ask him how. Whatever his 'trick' is, it doesn't emseem/em to work on our other iPad, which has not been updated to iOS 7.  I think I figured it out last night. After I input my password to install a (free) application, it seems he can hop in to an app and make a purchase using the 'cached' password. In the past I thought the password would be requested again for in-app purchases.  Have there been any changes to AppStore passwords in iOS 7, specifically the length of time before the password will be asked for again, or a change that allows in-app purchases during the 'caching' period? Or is this simply a change in his behavior?  subI've disabled in-app purchases now. Slightly annoying but it does solve the problem./sub  <answer117289> You can leave in-app purchases on if you wish.  Once you have enabled codeRestrictions/code then at the bottom of the second section, codeAllowed Content/code you will see codeRequire Password/code and underneath they even have a little prompt codeRequire password for purchases/code.  Change this from the default of code15 minutes/code to codeImmediately/code and your problem is fixed.
