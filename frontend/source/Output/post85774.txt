iOS: Multiple GMail send-form addresses, using S/MIME <body> I tried to setup my GMail-Account emincluding my various send-as-addresses/em that I set up in the Webmail interface using this great tutorial.  However, I have two issues:  ol liI cannot setup multiple S/MIME signing certificates, so only one address can send signed mails./li liThe iPhone has it's own idea which address should be the default from-Address./li /ol  Is there any way to setup a GMail-Account so there is one inbox, multiple send-as-addresses and an S/MIME-signing-certificate set up for each address, and a user-selectable default address? Apple Mail on OS X can do that.  <comment98872> Default `from` account for Mail can be set in `Settings-Mail-Default Account`, just below Signature setting. <comment98881> That's right - but I only have one Account. I do have multiple addresses, but they're all assigned to the same account.
