What is "Television" in System Information report for an external monitor (that is not actually a TV)? <body> The emSystem Information/em report for emGraphics/Displays/em on my MacBook Pro Retina (Late 2013) shows the following info for the internal screen and for an external Acer monitor.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M:    Chipset Model:    NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M   Type: GPU   Bus:  PCIe   PCIe Lane Width:  x8   VRAM (Total): 2048 MB   Vendor:   NVIDIA (0x10de)   Device ID:    0x0fe9   Revision ID:  0x00a2   ROM Revision: 3776   gMux Version: 4.0.8 [3.2.8]   Displays: Color LCD:   Display Type: Retina LCD   Resolution:   2880 x 1800 Retina   Retina:   Yes   Pixel Depth:  32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Main Display: Yes   Mirror:   Off   Online:   Yes   Built-In: Yes Acer H236HL:   Resolution:   1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz (1080p)   Pixel Depth:  32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)   Display Serial Number:    LX1AA0034210   Mirror:   Off   Online:   Yes   Rotation: Supported   Television:   Yes /code/pre  What is the meaning of that last item, codeTelevision: Yes/code? This hardware is emnot/em actually a TV, just a display with HDMI, DVI, and VGA inputs.  I understand that modern TVs are indeed just monitors with an OTA tuner and speakers implanted. But I wonder, given the lack of a tuner, what the meaning of that item in the report specifically means.  <answer259757> 1.What does Television:Yes mean?brbr It means your macbook is sending the color to your display not in RGB but in YCbCr space instead of RGB,which could lead to poor picture quality.brbr  2.Solution: brbrOverride an EDID (Extended_Display_Identification_Data) setting to force the RGB colour space  Threads  about forcing RGB mode instead of YCbCr  You can force RGB mode by following Turtorial on how to force RGB mode  This is long standing bug that Apple refuses to fix and that is not simple to work around.  <comment327293> Can you cite some authoritative source about part 1 of your Answer? I'd feel better than about accepting this Answer to close the Question. And thanks for the info. <comment327297> I tried before.When it's showing "Television:yes",my monitor's current colour space was always YCbCr just like others facing the same problem.Since I'm not a specialist in color space,i could not find proper authoritative document on this.Most answer to this question were based on tests.
