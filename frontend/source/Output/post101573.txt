Apple Mail, change incoming server <body> I have some Mac OS X users using Mail to check their emails. We are planing to change the mail servers and thus changing both incoming and outgoing server addresses.  Can I just change the existing accounts settings which are now using POP3 and switch them to the new IMAP server? Can I expect that Mail will kindly upload all the old emails or is it better to do it manually?  <comment119665> After switching from POP to IMAP if you run the sync command it should get all the emails. <comment119668> @Buscarì›ƒ getting the emails is fine but what about the ones that are already on the system. Will they be uploaded (and not deleted (my biggest fear))? <comment119673> Even if they get deleted in Mail, you should still have a copy on the serve, by making sure the option in mail is NOT set to delete mails on server when delete in mail.
