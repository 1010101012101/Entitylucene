todotxt color not working on iTerm2 <body> Is anyone here using todotxt and iterm2?  I'm having a weird issue. When using default terminal app in OSX, my todotxt color is working just fine.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3p0A.png" alt="default terminal app"  But when I switch to iterm2, the color is not displayed correctly.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJtLX.png" alt="iterm2"  I've changed color Report terminal type to xterm-256color and maxed out minimum contrast, but it still not working. BTW, I'm using oh-my-zsh as my shell. Anybody know how to fix it?? Thanks.  <answer171151> Turn minimum contrast back downâ€”that's what's washing out the colors. It's meant to increase the contrast between foreground text and background color, which is making the colors look wrong.
