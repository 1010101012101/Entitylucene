Word:mac 2011 preserve table formatting on copy-paste <body> In Microsoft Word 2010 for Windows, I can duplicate a table simply by clicking its handle at the top-left (which selects the entire table), copying it and pasting it. When I do that in Word:mac, the table and contents is duplicated without any of the table formatting. This kinda sucks because the original table has a number of merged cells and all sorts of formatting going on. I'm basically using the source table as a template.  I just updated Office:mac 2011 to SP2.  <answer63724> Go to:  ol liWord &#x2192; Preferences &#x2192; Edit &#x2192; Settings br (under cut and paste options use smart cut and paste)/li liRemove the check mark on em"Adjust table formatting and alignment on paste"/em./li /ol  Now try copy-paste of a table. It works.  <answer143485> So I tried to copy a few lines of words with the table to paste and it worked. I hope it does for you too.  example: copy "Hello how are you" with "Table 3." and the table itself.  Hello how are you  Table 3.   Table here  <answer168981> Neither one of these methods works for me. I tried unchecking both boxes in the address mentioned, but the problem, yet remains. The table goes scattered after I try to paste it in Mac Pages.  <comment78432> I disabled "Use smart cut and paste" (Word - Preferences - Edit) and now it works. It should be called stupid cut and paste. <comment168986> The OP indicated above that disabling smart cut and paste solved the issue. <comment180745> Neither of these tips worked for me. Using version "Word 2011 14.4.4. (14087)". <comment198423> This "Answer" is actually a question, not an answer.
