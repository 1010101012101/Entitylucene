Monitoring directory in finderSync extension failed to work <body> I have developed a cocoa application with a finderSync extension through which a newly created directory is monitored.   Sometimes it works fine but sometimes when I activate the Drive and Dropbox extension (from settings  preferences  extensions ), my application stops monitoring the directory for which it is intended.   I have searched for the solution but haven't found anything.   Do I need to register my application with an OSX service. ??
