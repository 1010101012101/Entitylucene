If an iPhone stolen and they restart it can it be tracked? <body> If my iPhone was stolen and they reset and everything got deleted will I still be able to track it if everything has be deleted?  <answer150337> If they deleted everything, then no... I guess you could then contact the police or something, resetting the iphone will cause the "find my iphone" feature to be disabled so yeah...  <answer170107> Nope they can't track it so its pretty much useless I wouldn't even try just a waste of time I just demanded another phone and the company eventually gave in  <answer170109> No, resetting the iPhone will disable Find my iPhone and your iCloud data will be deleted.  <comment176956> possible duplicate of [If I remote wipe my iPhone, can I still locate it remotely?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34861/if-i-remote-wipe-my-iphone-can-i-still-locate-it-remotely) <comment177880> The answer in the linked question is three years old, Apple made a lot of changes to Find My iPhone in the meantime.
