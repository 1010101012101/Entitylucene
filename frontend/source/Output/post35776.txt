Where is my Skype profile picture stored on OS X? <body> I took a profile picture for Skype using the "Capture a picture from a video camera" button found in the Skype profile dialog.  Now I want to use the picture for other things but I cannot find where the picture is being stored.  Any ideas?  (OS X Lion 10.7, Skype 5.3)  <answer35798> I've just tried this, and the answer was unexpected...  When I created the image it was stored in the following folder (before Mountain Lion):  precode~/Library/Images/IChat Recent Pictures /code/pre  Please note that as per skh's answer, since Mountain Lion (and still valid for macOS Sierra) the images are now stored in the following folder:  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent\ Pictures/ /code/pre  <answer64397> Took me a while to find this, but here's the profile picture directory in Mountain Lion:  code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ImageKit.RecentPictureService/Data/Library/Images/Recent\ Pictures//code  <comment40785> Actually this answer will also be useful for deleting the profile picture, since Skype does not seem to have a delete button once you enter a profile picture. <comment40802> It could be that it saves it here for everyone, or maybe it is just saving it in the same place that the last captured picture was saved? <comment40803> True, or it could be I'm using a different version of Skype possibly, or that my picture wasn't a picture from my iSight. Did you use your picture as your avatar? <comment40811> @ioi I'm using OS X 10.7 and Skype 5.3 the same as in the question. I clicked "Change Picture" on my profile page in the Skype interface and used the video camera to create the picture. <comment40833> I found it where you said it is ... so I've marked the answer as correct. <comment40834> @ioi ... yep I used the picture as my avatar <comment139912> I got a new mac with Mavericks preinstalled, and it's not true there. (guess since they stopped with iChat). That's why I downvoted <comment299865> Confirmed in El Capitan <comment361020> @zenopolis Thanks!
