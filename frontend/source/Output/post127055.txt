NET10 iPhone 4 shows no cellular data service despite plan having cellular data <body> I have a NET10 iPhone 4 and it keeps saying I have no cellular data service and cannot connect to internet. How can I get internet back? NET10 said I show I have internet. I have reset my phone and pretty much tried everything. I am paying for unlimited and have nothing. Can anyone help?  <comment148823> have you gotten any support from Net10 beyond them saying you show you have internet? <comment148825> Is this a new problem or did it newer worked ? <comment148827> Yes they walked me through a few things and were themselves puzzled.
