Prevent artwork synch in iTunes for iPhone <body> I want to turn off my artwork synch!  I don't care if I have the artwork or not!  Is there a work around for doing this?  My phone always gets locked in a loop when synching and it is "stuck" on step 8 of 8 backing up artwork!  <answer146382> You can do a bit of a clumsy workaround.   First you have to select all your songs on iTunes, right-click and select codeClear Downloaded Artwork/code. Than you can sync your library with your iPhone. After that you can download your artworks again. So you have your artworks on your computer, but not on your iPhone.   <comment172435> Deleting all artwork from iTunes would do the trick. Not syncing music would as well.
