How can I boot an Intel Core i7 iMac in 64-bit mode? <body> I have an iMac running OS X 10.6.8. The processor is a 2.8 GHz Intel Core i7 and the machine has 4 GB of RAM. How can I boot the computer in 64-bit mode (instead of 32-bit mode) so that I can upgrade to OS X 10.9 and run Final Cut Pro 10.3?  <answer159044> To start up with a special kernel check this from Apple: Starting up with the 32-bit or 64-bit kernel in 10.6 and later:     strongStartup key combination (for current startup only)/strong      If your Mac uses the 32-bit kernel by default, but supports the 64-bit   kernel, you can start up using the 64-bit kernel by holding the   kbd6/kbd and kbd4/kbd keys during startup.      If your Mac uses the 64-bit kernel by default, you can start up with   the 32-bit kernel by holding the kbd3/kbd and kbd2/kbd keys   during startup.      Your Mac will revert to the default kernel the next time you reboot   it.      strongOn-disk setting (persistent)/strong      To select the 64-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the   following command in Terminal:      codesudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64/code      To select the 32-bit kernel for the current startup disk, use the   following command in Terminal:      codesudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture i386/code      Note: This setting is stored in the   code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist/code file   and will take effect every time you start up from this disk. If you   start up from a different disk, the setting on that disk, or the   hardware default, will take effect.   To determine your currently running kernel open codeTerminal.app/code and enter:br codeuname -a/codebr Running with the 64-bit kernel, the output will end with codeRELEASE_X86_64 x86_64/code. Running with the 32-bit kernel, the output will end with codeRELEASE_I386 i386/code.  In your case you just have to update to Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9). Mavericks doesn't contain a 32-bit kernel anymore and since your i7-processor is 64-bit, everything just works right out of the box without key strokes or modifying codecom.apple.Boot.plist/code.
