Can I download Angry Birds as HTML5? <body> I know that Angry Birds is available as an online HTML5 version at http://chrome.angrybirds.com/.  I have an iPad, but I cannot install apps onto it, so I'd like to download the game so I can play it on my iPad (I think the iPad can render HTML5).  <answer61030> You cannot install any HTML5 app on iPad, unless you are playing it in a browser. To install any app in iPad or any iOS device, it has to be in code.ipa format/code.    I don't know why you can't install any app on your iPad, if it's an apple id issue, you can make a new one and then install.  <answer61129> The culprit here is actually your browser -- the device you are using is actually reported to the website by means of your browser's "user agent". The user agent tells the website what device and browser you are using. So, it makes sense that the only way to fool the Angry Birds website is to send a different user agent.  I'm assuming you can't jailbreak your iPad and modify the browser, but there is a method to modify the Safari user string without jailbreaking. However, you do need to be able to sync the iPad with your computer. Here is a link with instructions. Aside from that, you might be able to find a web proxy to change your user agent, but I don't know of any that will do that. Let me know if this helps.  <comment70344> I meant save the game in HTML format (it's written in HTML5). As for installing apps, my company disabled that. <comment70346> If the app can run in safari, you can play it. But the version you've listed is for chrome only, so you need to install chrome on iPad, which you can't unless your company approves it. I am downloading chrome on my iPad to check if I can play the game on iPad or not. <comment70347> Well they don't let mobile users play the HTML5 version. That's why I want to download it. <comment70349> Chrome on iPad is not a solution either. It's nothing like the desktop version and in fact uses a gimped JavaScript engine :) <comment70352> Yeah, I can't play it either. You can't use HTML5 apps, unless they can run on safari or iOS chrome. <comment88018> AFAIK this version of Angry Birds was written not completely on HTML5, they still use Flash for music(anything else?). <comment88019> It's called a [User Agent](http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/).
