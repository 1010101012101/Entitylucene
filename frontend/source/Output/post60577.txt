Any way to move contacts between groups on iPhone? <body> Is there any way to move a contact in Contacts on my iPhone into a group? I can create a new contact in any group, but I don't see a way to move an existing contact between groups.  Seems like an oversight that I would have to go back to my Mac, or delete a contact and manually recreate their card in a different group, in order to do this.  <answer60578> Moving contacts between groups cannot be done via iPhone. You will have to sync your iPhone via iTunes and ensure that contact sync in enabled. The following process can also be used with your GMail account instead of Exchange.  To move the existing contacts, follow these steps:  ol liConnect your iPhone to your Mac./li liOpen iTunes and look for your iPhone under devices in the left navigation section./li liClick on your iPhone to view iPhone sync settings./li liClick on the Info tab at the top of the sync section./li liOn the Info tab, select the checkbox next to 'Sync address book contacts'/li liClick Sync on the bottom right corner of the sync section./li /ol  The above instructions will sync your iPhone contacts to your Address Book on Mac.  ol liOpen Address Book./li liAdd your exchange account, if you have not done it already./li liAfter that you can move your iPhone contacts to your exchange account by dragging-and-dropping./li /ol  You should also configure the iPhone settings so that newly created contacts are created in the correct place, so you don't need to repeat this process,  ol liGo to Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendars/li liScroll to 'Contacts' section/li liTap on the 'Default Account' tab and select your exchange account./li /ol  You should be set now!  <answer60585> This cannot be done on the phone. You can sync your contacts to a Mac and do the changes from Address Book on the Mac.  You can also do this via iCloud.com.  <answer105134> Use Orbi Tools. Can be downloaded from App Store.  <answer258419> ol liGo to "groups" in "Contacts" and uncheck all the groups except the one the contact you want to move is in./li liSearch for the contact you want to move and "Share" the contact  to your own email address or phone # via text. /li liClick "edit" on the contact you just sent and delete it./li liGo back to Groups and uncheck the group the contact was sent from./li liLeave only the Group you want the contact in checked./li liGo to your email/text and import the new contact.  It will automatically be added to the only active group which you selected./li liGo back to Contact Groups and select all the groups you want showing on your phone./li /ol  Voila!     <comment69736> Actually, I just discovered that you can move contacts between groups on iCloud.com. Still not ideal, and still ridiculous that you can't do this on the phone itself, but still better than having to sync over USB. <comment123622> Can you explain more <comment123635> Go to the App Store, search for Orbi Tools, should be the first program on the search result. Once installed, it will ask you to allow access to your contact list. Confirm, and then close and start the app. Select copy (or move "cut") to move contacts between different groups. If you have an Outlook account, then the group name will be Exchange, Contacts. If you have more than one Outlook account, then you have to click on the Exchange, Contacts group and note the number of contacts and cross check the number with your Contact app to know which group you have accessed. <comment145276> Wow---Thanks---Orbi Tools was well worth the 99 cents . very easy to use. <comment148366> Awesome, well worth the money! Took me less than 30 seconds to migrate my contacts!!! <comment271473> Crap App, moved my contacts but now i lost the phonenumber of the contacts!!! <comment285773> the phrasing here 'do the changes' is too ambiguous, and after ~5 minutes of attempts I cannot get either Address Book ("Contacts" now) nor iCloud.com to work. So I reject this idea, Nivas can you update or clarify please :)? <comment285777> This App accesses my CardDAV and Exchange accounts, but nothing else :(. Specifically it does not access my Gmail contacts, which was my primary need :( <comment285830> @J-Dizzle Can you post the specific issue that you are facing? <comment285832> thanks for the contact and the offer! I would like to move "Contact A" from "iCloud Group A" to "Gmail Group B". My only current solution is to #1 manually delete, #2 change 'Settings-Mail, Contacts-Default Account', then #3 manually re-add the contact. Is there an easier way? I've looked at several Apps, contacted tech support and even paid for a few apps, with no luck! <comment285842> You cannot move across groups between accounts in icloud.com. If both groups were in the same account then you could drag and drop the contact from group 1 to other group 2 in the side bar. I am not sure if you can move in the Contacts app, I will check when I am home and have access to a mac. <comment285899> @J-Dizzle Checked on my mac - you can just drag and drop contacts between groups.  Make sure groups are visible (View Menu - Show Groups) and drag and drop contacts across. <comment285902> this works between iCloud groups and I've used it here :). But it does not work for Gmail or Exchange contacts :(! <comment285981> @J-Dizzle You can do this on a Mac (the contacts app on a Mac). That was the original answer anyway :-) <comment304527> And now it doesn't exist anymore.
