Python 3.3.3 on Macbook pro, can't open IDLE at all <body> I'm having trouble with running python on my Macbook Pro OS X 10.9.1.   Two days ago it was running with absolutely no problem and now it won't start up.   I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and update the Tkinter and Tcl/Tk etc.   It appears in the dock for a second then disappears. Any help would be appreciated.  <answer114771> When in doubt cycle power.  Then if IDLE continues to not start:  When you uninstalled did you delete the savedState file from:  ~/Library/Saved Application State/  If not try using AppCleaner to delete everything associated with IDLE and reinstall.  One other thing to think of: Have you moved or renamed the working folder? Some apps don't like it when you move/rename their folder.  You could also try an earlier version (assuming you have the latest version, if not try that) and see if it will run.  <answer114806> See this important note on the official Python website about Tcl/Tk and IDLE on Mac OS X. You should install a third-party version of Tcl/Tkl to solve your problem.     Python's integrated development environment, IDLE, and the tkinter GUI   toolkit it uses, depend on the Tk GUI toolkit which is not part of   Python itself. For best results, it is important that the proper   release of Tcl/Tk is installed on your machine.      em[...]/em      If you are using Python from a python.org 64-bit/32-bit Python   installer for Mac OS X 10.6 and later, you should only use IDLE or   tkinter with an updated third-party Tcl/Tk 8.5, like ActiveTcl 8.5   installed.      If you are using OS X 10.9 Mavericks and a Python from a python.org   64-bit/32-bit installer, application windows may not update properly   due to a Tk problem. Install the latest ActiveTcl 8.5.15.0 if   possible. (Also, a critical OS X 10.9 problem that could cause Python   to crash when used interactively has been fixed in the current 3.3.3,   2.7.6, and pre-release 3.4.0 64-bit/32-bit installers.)
