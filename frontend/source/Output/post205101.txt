macports: bash_completion not working with make (with gmake or without) <body> I've installed codebash_completion/code from codemacports/code. Completion works fine for codegit/code, for instance, where I installed code+bash_completion/code variant.  Completion doesn't work for codemake/code, whether I install codemacports'/code codegmake/code or not. codegmake/code doesn't even have code+bash_completion/code variant.  How do I make it work?  <answer208314> Apparently I didn't follow codebash/code installation instructions. On a fresh system, after adding codebash/code to code/etc/shells/code and codechsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash/code, it worked.  <comment247314> How should it work? <comment247317> The way it works on Linux: complete makefile targets after 'make ' tab.
