How can I avoid that my wife’s iPad sounds an alarm every time I add an event to a shared calendar in iCal? <body> I share my work calendar on iCal with my wife (synced with iCloud). Every time I add an event to that calendar, my wife’s iPad plays a sound. Because I live in Europe but work for a company in the US, this often happens in the middle of the night for us, and the pings wake her up.  Is there a way to disable these sound notifications on her iPad?  <answer286041> This can be done in the strongNotifications/strong settings.  h2How to adjust notifications for iOS Calendar/h2  On the iPad:  ul liGo to strongSettings/strong/li liSelect strongNotifications/strong/li liSelect strongCalendar/strong/li liSelect strongShared Calendar Changes/strong/li liSelect strongSounds/strong/li liSelect strongNone/strong/li /ul  One can also adjust several other types of notifications as well or even completely disable notifications for the Calendar app.  Another setting to look at is strongDo Not Disturb/strongbr This can be set manually or on a schedule.  From the settings:     When Do Not Disturb is enabled, a moon icon will appear in the status bar and incoming FaceTime calls and alerts will be silenced.   <comment361046> My wife thanks you. :) <comment361061> Glad it helped!!
