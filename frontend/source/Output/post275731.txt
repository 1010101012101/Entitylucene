Microsoft Office wants to use my confidential information no matter how many times I select "Always Allow" <body> I get popups for all of the MS Office apps on my Macbook Pro saying:     Microsoft [whatever].app wants to use your confidential information stored in "[long hash]" in your keychain.  Do you want to allow access to this item?   I have tried a lot of different things, including selecting "Always Allow", but sure enough, next time (every time) I start my machine the popups return.  I've also tried things found in other answers, such as deleting keychain items with references to OC_*, using Keychain First Aid (apparently not available in El Capitan?), etc.  What do you have to do to get this to stop?
