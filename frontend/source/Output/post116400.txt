Wi-Fi settings grayed out on iPhone <body> When I go into strongSetting / Wifi/strong and try to turn Wifi on, it does not let me. The emswitch/em is grayed out.  How can I solve this issue?  <answer116403> There are a couple of things you could try:  ul liRestarting your iPhone./li liReseting the network settings on strongSettings / General / Reset / Reset Network Settings/strong. This will reset all network settings, including Bluetooth pairing records, Wi-Fi passwords, VPN, and APN settings./li liBack up the device and then restore the firmware and software from iTunes /li /ul  If none of these work, it's probably a hardware issue and you should contact Apple support.   <answer116495> this is the only guide that worked for me : http://smarttechtips.blogspot.com/2013/12/how-to-fix-grayed-out-wifi-on-iphone.html  stronghere is a summary of what you are going to do :D :/strong   ul liyou will have to jailbreak your device first./li lienable cellular data and install openSSH, afc2add (those 2 apps are around 4  megabytes only)/li liinstall an app called ispirit on your pc and then connect your device./li liinstall macfixer on your phone using ispirit , then restart cydia and install essential updates (you will find an update for macfixer, install it )/li lirestart your phone./li liif this didn't work then try the hair dryer method first , (only heat the specified parts for 3-4 minutes or till you get the message that says 'your phone is too hot....') then reapply this guide again. hope this helps :D/li /ul  <comment136147> thanks but that doesn't work and my wifi says no wifi <comment136152> So you're actually able of turning Wifi **on**?
