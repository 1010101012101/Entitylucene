No sound from mac, how to find the problem? <body> Good day, I have Macbook Pro 2012 with el Capitan 10.11.3.  The problem - no sound from my mac.  I have listen the music, after that I decide to insert headphones, when I'm taking out the headphones sound from Mac disappeared and there is red light from audio jack. Between that I have made an update from 10.11 to 10.11.3, maybe the problem is with that?  There was not any sound from my mac on startup, but when I have use disk utility repair the sound on startup appears..   How can I diagnose myself where is the problem and fix it ? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GdWM6.png" alt=""  <answer227317> Try strongholding down option/strong and strongclicking on the sound icon/strong in the menu bar at the top of the screen. It'll give you a few options you can tweak.  My guess is that you're most likely AirPlaying your sound to muted speakers.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNaqQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer227383> strongYour MacBook believes you've plugged in an optical audio cable when you haven't./strong  Turns out, that headphone jack is actually a combo jack that has both optical audio and analog audio. There's a little lever in there that detects when you've put a cable in there that's probably stuck. Try fiddling with a toothpick or repeatedly plugging and unplugging.  <comment276131> This icon is gray{ <comment276143> Nope: Notice the mention of a red light and the system preferences pane outputting to "Optical".
