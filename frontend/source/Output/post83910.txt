Finder folder icons look like document and image files <body> I've got an annoying issue for a couple of weeks now. My folder icons got corrupted from time to time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2bmH3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Left side is the view I get when I'm switching between views, but when I open finder or navigate to a folder I see its content as on the right side of the image. When I have multiple files and subfolders in a folder, icons of the folders appear as icons of images, and documents around them...  I have the latest updates and I've never used any app that customises Finder.  Has anybody experienced something similar?  Update: I have Tuxera NTFS 2012.3.4 and OSXfuse 2.5.4 installed. Removing OSXfuse and disabling Tuxera doesn't affect this behaviour.  Update: Same behaviour with OSX 10.8.3  <answer83928> Try resetting the Launch Services database. Dig into your strongUtilities/strong folder and paste this into strongTerminal/strong:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  You may need to restart the strongDock/strong and strongFinder/strong to see if it's worked:  precodekillall Dock; killall Finder /code/pre  Alternatively, just reboot after you've reset the Launch Services database.  <comment96549> Which version of OS X do you have? <comment96553> Oh, sorry: 10.8.2 <comment96555> Welcome to AskDifferent. Can you please add the "mountain-lion" tag to your question then? With that it's clear to everybody what you mean with "latest updates." <comment96559> Are those folders stored locally on your harddrive or do you mount them from a network Volume? In the latter case, is it CIFS, AFP, NFS...? <comment96565> Locally stored folders and external HDDs. <comment96669> Unfortunately resetting the launch service DB and restarting the macbook doesn't help, my icons are still messed up.
