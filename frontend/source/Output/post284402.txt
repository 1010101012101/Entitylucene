Automator's "Combine PDF Pages" action doesn't preserve crop? <body> I'm trying to separately crop PDF's even and odd pages, by building on top of the accepted answer from How to crop odd and even pages differently in a PDF?  My Automator workflow, roughly:  ol liautomatically codeExtract Odd &amp; Even Pages/code; each output PDF filename is suffixed with "(Even Pages)" or "(Odd Pages)"/li lipause Automator Workflow with codeAsk for Confirmation/code and manually crop each of the two output PDFs (using codeRectangular Selection/code and codeCrop/code in Preview)/li liselect the two cropped PDFs using codeGet Folder Contents/code/li licodeCombine PDF Pages/code with codeShuffling pages/code option /li /ol  strongThe issue is step 4. which inevitably seems to drop any codeCrop/code from step 2./strong The combined PDF has no crop applied to it, even though the two even &amp; odd input PDFs are definitely cropped.  Is this expected behaviour from codeCombine PDF Pages/code? PDF metadata and annotations do seem to get dropped, does codeCrop/code as well?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCpSe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer284440> There is a package called codepdfjoin/code which uses codepdflatex/code to combine pdf files. You could try joining your pdf's in the following way:  precodepdfjoin 01.pdf 02.pdf /code/pre  which will combine the files into a single pdf called code02-combined.pdf/code, in your current working directory.  If you don't have LaTeX installed you can follow this guide to do so.   This preserved crops for me when I tried. If you can get this working on your system, you could then maybe look at putting this together in a bash script.
