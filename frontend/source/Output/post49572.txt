How do I get the Unicode code of a character from the Character Viewer? <body> I recall that the Character Viewer showed me the Unicode value of any character I selected, but now it doesn't show it anymore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70Rl0.png" alt="screenshot"  How do I make it show the Unicode value as before?  If that makes any difference, I am using Mac OS X 10.7.3.  <answer49576> In Character Viewer, click the gear icon in the top-left, then select "Customize List".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ey3S4.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the dialog that appears, scroll to the bottom and check "Unicode" under the "Code Tables" branch.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n77Ou.png" alt="enter image description here"  You should see something like this if you click on the "Unicode" item that's now in the left-hand pane (with unicode hex values down the left-hand column):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzzZp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively, you can also right-click the character and select "Copy Character Info".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fhe0g.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, if you paste into a text editor you get:  precodeA LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A Unicode: U+0041, UTF-8: 41 /code/pre  <comment57028> Once you have added the Unicode item to the list at the left, you will also see the Unicode value of all characters that you select even when you are NOT in that category, e.g. when you select Arrows instead. <comment108630> Thank you. Lack of Unicode info would have been a major annoyance. Glad to know it's still there.
