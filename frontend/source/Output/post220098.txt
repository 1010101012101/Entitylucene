How to disable F7 F8 F9 function for Quick Time Player <body> I have OS X 10.11, Quick Time Player 10.4.  My question is simple, how do you disable kbdF7/kbd, kbdF8/kbd and kbdF9/kbd function keys in QT Player?  I want to use these keys for iTunes, but I really need to keep some of the movies open. But whenever I press kbdF8/kbd, it will activate iTunes and QuickTime Player at the same time. Then I have to dig into QT Player and stop it.  Is there a way to disable the kbdF7/kbd, kbdF8/kbd and kbdF9/kbd functions for QT?
