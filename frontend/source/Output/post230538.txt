Strange File Appeared In My Home Folder <body> I just discovered a strange file in my home folder.  It is titled: - The entire contents are the word: ok on the first line &amp; a blank second line. There is no extension. It was created this past Monday at 4:55pm &amp; last modified/opened at 4:56.  How can I find out what created this? Should I be concerned? How can I find what other files, invisible or otherwise, might have been created around that same time on Monday?   <answer264609> It's almost certainly harmless. If you select a file on the desktop (even unintentionally) and press enter and then type ok - that would explain the naming.  I would open the terminal app (/Applications/Utilities) and type file and then drag the questionable file into the window and press enter.  That will look at the file contents and give you a hint about what it might contain. Spotlight information could help find other files around the same time, but I'd start with the codefile/code tool and get more information or just delete the file named OK - especially if you have a backup where you could get back what you lost if you find out later it was an image or document you needed.
