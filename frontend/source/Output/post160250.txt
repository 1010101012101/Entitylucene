Backup of a Debian machine to an Apple Time Capsule <body> I have two Macs, backed up on a 3TB Apple Time Capsule. But I also have a Debian machine on the same local network, and I would like to emback it up/em (at least one of its hard disks) emon the same Apple Time Capsule/em. Is this possible?  To prevent misunderstandings: I found zillions of places on the Web where people explain how to use a Debian machine as a cheaper version of Apple Time Capsule. This is emnot/em what I need. What I need is to emback up the Debian machine on a (real) Apple Time Capsule/em. Thanks in advance for any advice!  <answer160284> In AirPort Utility, turn off the backup feature, turn off disk encryption, and turn on disk sharing with a password. Now you can connect to the disk over the network using the AFP protocol.  In most graphical file explorers you can now connect to the disk using the address codeafp://&lt;ip-address-of-airport&gt;/code. To easily configure scheduled backups to the device, you can check out Déjà Dup (known as simply “Backup” in Ubuntu).  You emcannot/em backuo your Macs using Time Machine and your Linux machine to the same device. The two setups are incompatible as Time Machine requires proprietary extension to AFP. I would recommend you get a cheap Raspberry Pi and a two-terabyte power-over-USB-external-disk to host your Linux backup needs. (Install openssh and ufw, and you’re basically done setting up a simplistic firewalled backup device on the cheap.)  <comment188386> The time capsule can be mounted as a drive via AFP but note that in Debian you can have files that differ by just case so multiple files would map to one on the TC so not a safe backup <comment188427> @Mark: Debian supports both case-sensitive and case-insensitive filesystems, so it might be ok. Definitely something to take note of, though. <comment188430> @0942v8653 Wrong way round what matters is HFS which is case insensitive so only case insensitive Debian would work and that is not standard <comment188444> @Mark: That's what I meant. I didn't know that Debian's FS was case-sensitive by default. It just depends on how it's configured. <comment188449> @0942v8653 It is more than a simple choice OS X can run on either and a few things won't work I suspect on a Debian FS with cases insensitive a lot of things won't work <comment358648> Just to add a tidbit: The HFS file System can be set to case sensitive (as opposed to case-preserving, which is the default) during file system creation.
