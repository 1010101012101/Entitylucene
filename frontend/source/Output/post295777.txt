Add text captions/subtitles to videos without Adobe Premiere? (burn in) <body> I want to add text captions to some videos I am uploading to social media/Facebook.  Is there a simple way to do this in QuickTime? Adobe Premiere is too expensive.  <answer295779> You can use strongVideo Caption Maker/strong to add captions/subtitles directly to your videos. Its free (with a watermark).  <comment373550> ill give this a try, tnx
