Can I list all programs that depend on a given framework? <body> I'm curious about what all on a stock OSX install uses the WebKit framework, since I keep seeing it pop up in crashlogs and it's supposedly a handy rendering swiss-army knife.  strongWhat's a good way to list all of the applications on my machine that use WebKit/Core somehow?/strong  I'm concerned about missing some due to fragmentation within the WebKit framework (codeWebKit/code and codeWebKit2/code off the top of my head, but I fear there's more granular versions). Would I have better results with WebCore?  Mucking around with codeotool/code seemed promising, but I can't figure out what exactly it's expecting.  strongBonus:/strong can I figure out what's using it on iOS too, if I have XCode installed?
