Access encrypted Ubuntu disk on macOS <body> I'm trying to access a disk, from macOS, that has an Ubuntu installation on it. I was able to mount the disk with Paragon ExtFS tool but I don't know how to go about the encryption part. I do have the passphrase.  <answer273800> Unfortunately, there is no native method to access an encrypted Linux volume on macOS.  A technique that may work for you is downloading VirtualBox (a free and open source virtual machine program), installing a Linux distribution in a VM, setting the host (macOS)'s code/dev/code directory as shared to the VM, and then try to mount the disk on the virtual machine, through the shared code/dev/code file. The likelihood of this working is not great, but it might work. Can't hurt to try.
