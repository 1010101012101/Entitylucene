Safari can't open the page because Safari can't establish a secure connection <body> I am running Mac OS X 10.7.3 in VirtualBox. The reason is I have to deploy an old iOS app to the app store. And it runs on Xcode 4.3.2. If I try running the xcode on a newer version of Mac OS X, like 10.9.5, I would get an error “This installation of Xcode 4.3.2 requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion.” My iPhone app is 100 percent complete and 100 percent working. I just need to deploy to app store. When I try to deploy on 10.7.3 on VirtualBox, I first try to go to Apple’s Developer Portal. I get the following message:     Safari can’t open the page. Safari can’t open the page   “https://developer.apple.com/account/overview.action” because Safari   can’t establish a secure connection to the server   “developer.apple.com”.   I am looking for the quickest way to deploy this to the store. What can I do?  <answer258781> That's because developer.apple.com no longer supports older TLS and SSL protocols - it only supports TLS 1.2 (see https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=developer.apple.com). Older Safari versions (before version 7) do not support TLS 1.2  (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:TLS/SSL_support_history_of_web_browsers) .  You could try installing Firefox or another browser in the VM to access the site.  <comment322703> Mac OS X Lion is no longer supported in any respect and Safari in that version is outdated as well and cannot make secure connections to may sites requiring it. You could try using Firefox. <comment322706> Firefox refuses to install on that version.
