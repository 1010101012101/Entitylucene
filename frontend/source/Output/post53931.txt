Whats a good software title to take video (mp4, avi, other..) and burn it to DVD <body> I got some home brew videos from my webcam, and I got a couple movies on the drive I'd like to burn to DVD. The thing is, I don't know what's a good product for that, being a recent Mac convert and formally a heavy Windows user.   I keep finding things about iDVD when I search but from further reading iDVD is no longer available. So doing a quick search on google you get your standard "This app will do it all" type sites, usually really crappy software so I don't want to waste 20, 50, 100+ dollars on an app that I'll use once in a blue moon or on an app that's actually worthless.  <answer53946> ul liTo burn DVDs: Toast Titanium/li liTo rip DVDs: RipIt or Mac The Ripper/li liTo convert between video formats: Handbrake, ideally together with VLC/li /ul  <answer98943> If you're going to burn to DVD, you need a replacement for iDVD, and you don't want to spend beau coup cash, use Burn. Burn is free, and works swimmingly.  <comment61715> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14351/ <comment61723> Please stick to one topic for one questions, additional questions may easily be missed and will definitively making answering more difficult. <comment116288> Most people will answer this question as if you were triying to burn data files ( that happen to be video files ) to a DVD-ROM. I'm sure you want to make a DVD-player-playable-movie DVD, in which case some convertion has to be done and even adding a menu. Am I wrong ? <comment141086> Great tool - just found it via this answer.  It won't recode to fit a target size if your films are larger than the disc size, but other than that it does everything that you need for making simple DVD from MP4 videos.
