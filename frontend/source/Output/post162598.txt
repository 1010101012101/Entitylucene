Programmatically send text message through Messages app on OS X 10.10 <body> With OSX 10.10 you can now send and receive text messages through your phone, from your mac. Is it possible to do this programatically? Either via applescript or a reverse engineered API?  <answer162677> There is quite a few good examples out there for using Applesccript to send iMessages.  I haven't found one yet that will work to a number via sms, the below script only works with iMessage.  Also it limited to the number(s) in your contacts(buddy list) and will error out if the buddy/number isn't in your contacts.  Here's one that I use to send notifications of a server backup complete.  Create an applescript named "emsendMessage.scpt/em" with the following code:  precodeon run {targetBuddyPhone, targetMessage} tell application "Messages"     set targetService to 1st service whose service type = iMessage     set targetBuddy to buddy targetBuddyPhone of targetService     send targetMessage to targetBuddy end tell end run /code/pre  Then from strongterminal.app/strong run this command to send iMessage:  precodeosascript /path/to/sendMessage.scpt 12345550123 "Your Text Message to Send" /code/pre  just change em12345550123/em to the number your sending to.  Link to original guide from stackeoverflow  <answer163046> Using:  precodetell application "Messages"     get name of every service end tell /code/pre  I noticed that I have "SMS" as a 4th option (yours may be different). So then I used:  precodelaunch application "Messages" tell application "Messages"      activate --steal focus       set targetBuddy to "12345550123"      set targetService to id of service "SMS"      set textMessage to "Just a test"       set theBuddy to buddy targetBuddy of service id targetService      send textMessage to theBuddy end tell /code/pre  This lets me send a text message over SMS Relay. I'm not 100% sure that I did this correctly, but it does work if targetService points to "SMS". Now to convert it to script that works from the terminal.
