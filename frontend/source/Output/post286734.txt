Is there any way to fast foward/rewind in iOS Podcast app with bluetooth earphones? <body> As discussed here, whenever you try to initiate fast forward from a pair of bluetooth earphones, the Podcast app actually skips to the next track instead. On the contrary, the behavior is as expected in Music app.  Is there any way to fast forward instead of skipping track in Podcast? Or is there any alternative podcast app that can do it? I used Pocket Casts on Android but I'm not sure how its iOS version is yet.
