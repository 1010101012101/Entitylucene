How can I increase the mouse sensitivity of Magic Mouse? <body> I have a MacBook Pro, running Snow Leopard and I'm using a Magic Mouse which connects through Bluetooth.  While I like the mouse, it's way too slow for my taste. Moving the mouse cursor takes ages. On my Windows PC I'm using a Logitech G9 and in Control Panel of Windows I have set Pointer Speed to maximum with the 'Enhance Pointer Precision' box checked.  On OS X I have set the speed set to maximum as well, but it's still way to slow. I'm used to move the pointer from from egde of the screen to another one with minimal wrist movement.  <answer3292> Here are 5 Mac utilities that alter the mouse acceleration curve, speeds, and/or add features to mice in OS X:  USB Overdrive  strong$20/strong (Shareware; Free unlimited, fully functional trial)     USB Overdrive is a popular program   that works with just about any USB or   Bluetooth input device. It allows   users to customize mouse acceleration,   scrolling, clicking, and more. You can   even configure per-application   settings. A new version that supports   Multi-Touch in Apple’s Magic Mouse is   in development and expected soon.   Version 3.0.1 compatible with 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6  SteerMouse  strong$20/strong (Shareware; Free 30 day trial)     Aside from mouse acceleration,   SteerMouse offers a ton of other   advanced features. Configure up to 16   buttons, modify scroll wheels/balls,   and set the cursor to automatically   move to a specific location on the   screen when a window is activated.   Support for the Apple Magic Mouse is   pending.   Version 4.0.1 compatible with 10.4, 10.5, or 10.6  MouseZoom  strongFree/strong     While MouseZoom does not alter the   acceleration curve itself, it does let   users bump tracking speeds beyond   those available in System Preferences.   An ideal solution? No, but it’s a free   alternative that helps ease the pain.   Version 2.2 compatible with 10.1, 10.2, 10.4, 10.4, or 10.5  Mouse Acceleration  strongFree/strong     This Preference Pane is based on   Richard Bentley’s MouseFix – a   non-user-friendly command line   utility. This version, however, makes   it easy to increase mouse precision   and speed up mouse movement with   visual aids.   Version 1.0 compatible with 10.4 or 10.5  BetterTouchTool  strongFree/strong     This is a brand new piece of software   that just came to be within the past   couple weeks. It’s in beta and still   buggy, but it packs some nice features   and is in active development. I can’t   say for sure whether it customizes OS   X’s acceleration curve or just   supercharges the maximum tracking   speed. The real reason to give it a   shot, though, is if you have a Magic   Mouse or MacBook that supports   Multi-Touch gestures. BetterTouchTool   lets users assign specific actions to   advanced finger gestures and can   simulate a middle-click. It can even   bring the Mighty Mouse’s Exposé   functionality to the Magic Mouse.   Compatible with 10.6  ControllerMate  strong$15/strong      ControllerMate is a controller   programming tool that allows you to   customize the behavior of your HID   devices — keyboards, keypads, mice,   trackballs, joysticks, gamepads,   throttles, among others.   ControllerMate’s philosophy is to be   as flexible as possible, to provide a   set of basic programming tools, and to   allow the user to combine those tools   in an endless variety of ways.   strongSOURCE/strong: This was posted on Nov 24th, 2009 at MacYourself.com. Some utilities are probably updated now. I’ve used USB Overdrive with certain success.   <answer272932> Use the Better Touch tool.  Works perfect.  <comment25946> Just to add now that Lion is out: Apple finally fixed this, the mouse sensitivity in Lion is much better. <comment44668> This is a great answer, but for me - none of the free software was able to make the mouse *feel* right. Upgrading from Snow Leopard to Lion, however - did the trick. <comment343089> Can you please specify your answer a bit more? <comment343098> Welcome to Ask Different.
