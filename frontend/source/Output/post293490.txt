Merge partitions <body> I wanted to merge two partitions of my strong/dev/disk1/strong without missing all my data from "Data" partition. (There was two partitions named "Data" and "Data_2"). Using this tutorial I've erased my partition "Data_2".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FebWC.png" alt="enter image description here"  After erasing the volume, I can't run "strongresizevolume/strong" command. There's an error "strongError: -69743: The new size must be different than the existing size/strong". Also after erasing, Disk Utility not shows unused 250GB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xUbGP.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nVMPU.png" alt="enter image description here"
