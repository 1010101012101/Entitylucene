How do I get the full path for a file in finder? <body> I look for a file in finder, finder finds it.  But, I'd like to find it's full path. How do I do that?  <answer96739> There are a few ways:  ul liRight-click the folder name in the top of the window  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTxPV.png" alt="Finder Window Path"/li liIn the Finder choose "View  Show Path Bar"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ELK2l.png" alt="Finder Path Bar"/li liUse Go2Shell to open a terminal window at that location/li /ul  <answer96741> You can also enter the following in Terminal:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES/codebr thenbr codekillall Finder/code  This will display the full path in the titlebar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbfsC.png" alt="path"  to turn it back off change the -bool codeYES/code to codeNO/code  Or if you want to copy the text of the path you can drag the file into Terminal.  <answer96742> You can right click on it and select "get info" and it should be written in the window that will pop the full path of the folder.  <answer96757> Command-C on the file to copy, and Command-V on the command line in Terminal. Or drag the file to the Terminal window  <comment113549> I cannot see the View option, I have no menu bar.  Any help? <comment113596> The menu bar I am referring to is at the top of the screen. It begins with the Apple icon, then Finder, File, Edit, View, Go, Window, and Help. If that menu bar is not visible you have much larger problems. <comment113597> Ah, I missed that one :) <comment373759> @DaveNelson, This doesn't show the real full Unix path though
