How do I make git credential-osxkeychain work correctly when I'm connected to a machine via SSH? <body> I setup a build machine to check out sources from Github by caching the login credential in the keychain using instructions from: https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/  Using codeSSH/code to connect to the build machine and run the instructions provided fails silently, asking me for a password for each codegit clone/code command.  Using codeVNC/code to connect to the build machine and run the instructions provided prompts me the first time, as expected, but not for any subsequent codegit clone/code commands, and successfully adds the credential to the keychain.  How can I configure the credential helper and/or keychain to make this work over codeSSH/code without a codeVNC/code connection?  <answer234024> You can use codeForwardAgent/code option in code~/.ssh/config/code, if it is allowed on server by option codeAllowAgentForwarding/code (in codesshd_config/code).  Or just simply with a switch code-A/code to codessh/code. It will forward connection to your agent to the server and you will be able to authenticate to github.
