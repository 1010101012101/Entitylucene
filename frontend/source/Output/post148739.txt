Concatenating date and cycle count to file on startup <body> I have the following code from here to find the cycle count of the battery on my computer:  codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'/code  I will enclose it in a simple app that I will put in the Utilities folder in my applications folder as follows: NameofApp.sh.app-Contents-MacOS-NameofApp.sh. I will have it open on startup by means of System Preferences-Users and Groups-Login Items.  I was hoping to use the codedate/code command in terminal which gives output (As I'm sure you know) as codeTue Oct  7 19:32:33 EDT 2014/code. I was hoping to delimit the date and the cycle count so I can easily separate it in excel.  The final product I was hoping for consist of a program that upon startup, prints the date + delimiter + cycle count to a new line in a text file (On desktop).  For example,  precodeTue Oct  7 19:32:33 EDT 2014#776 Tue Oct  8 13:55:02 EDT 2014#776 Tue Oct  8 21:23:16 EDT 2014#777 . . . . . Tue Dec 12 07:34:56 EDT 2015#???? /code/pre  I'm having trouble combining the date with the output of the program above.  Thank you in advance  <answer148891> Thanks to @MateusvSzlosek, The following one-liner works:  precodeecho `date`@`system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'` &gt;&gt; output.txt /code/pre  <comment175287> Are You looking for a one liner command? I'm not sure if I understand the question. Here's my command: `echo \`date\`#\`system_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'\`  output.txt`
