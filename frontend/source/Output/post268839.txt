Close menu bar menu with applescript <body> precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 where description is "system sound volume")         click     end tell end tell /code/pre  will open the sound menu bar item, but I want to delay one second then close it.  I tried:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 where description is "system sound volume")         click         delay 1         cancel     end tell end tell /code/pre  but that didn't work  <answer268864> You almost had it.  This works for me.  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     tell (menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1 where description is "system sound volume")         click         delay 1         key code 53     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment337656> But if the user selects another app then the escape will be sent to the focussed app. <comment337657> I'm not quite sure about that because your script draws focus to the system and sound volume icon, then clicks.  With A delay of only one second, I doubt there would be anytime to draw focus to another application before the escape event. <comment337658> No I am sure about this, because I have tested. About 5 hours ago <comment337661> You are correct. I just tried it myself. I'm testing a few other options and will be back shortly
