SSH to a remote station without port forwarding on my mac <body> I would like to SSH onto a remote linux computer from the internet at school, which does not support port forwarding.   I type codessh root@&lt;myipadresshere.com/code  but of course it fails.   Is there a way to SSH to my remote server using any network I am connected to without the ports being forwarded?  If I type SSH -A root@MyIP , it times out.  precodeSkylers-MacBook-Pro:~ skylerfennell$ ssh -vvv root@kd0whb.duckdns.org OpenSSH_5.9p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to kd0whb.duckdns.org [67.166.55.176] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_4.3 debug1: match: OpenSSH_4.3 pat OpenSSH_4* debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9 debug2: fd 3 setting O_NONBLOCK debug3: load_hostkeys: loading entries for host "kd0whb.duckdns.org" from file "/Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/known_hosts" debug3: load_hostkeys: found key type RSA in file /Users/skylerfennell/.ssh/known_hosts:6 debug3: load_hostkeys: loaded 1 keys debug3: order_hostkeyalgs: prefer hostkeyalgs: ssh-rsa-cert-v01@openssh.com,ssh-rsa-cert-v00@openssh.com,ssh-rsa debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent Write failed: Broken pipe   Skylers-MacBook-Pro:~ skylerfennell$ ssh -a root@kd0whb.duckdns.org     ssh: connect to host kd0whb.duckdns.org port 22: Operation timed out /code/pre  <answer144260> are you referring to port forwarding or agent forwarding?  By default, port forwarding isn't enabled unless you use -L or -R options.  Agent forwarding (for authentication using keys in your local ssh-agent) can be enabled by using   precodessh -A &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt; /code/pre  Let me know if this is helpful.  <comment170001> Ok, well I won't be able to tell you until Monday <comment170270> Note that options can be implied by `/etc/ssh_config` and `~/.ssh/config` -- have you checked those files to make sure the type of forwarding you're explicitly trying not to do isn't enabled by default?
