Can I Remap Command+F in Safari? <body> How can I remap kbdCommand/kbd+kbdf/kbd to search the current web page? In Safari it somehow is set as a shortcut for fullscreen, which drives me insane!  What I would like is to at least kill kbdCommand/kbd+kbdf/kbd to act as a no operation or remap it to do text search in the page.  This is crucial to sort throught the posts of an assortment of comments under YouTube videos.  <answer286912> You can do it like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5XZsR.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeSystem preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Shortcuts -&gt; App Shortcuts /code/pre  Click code+/code And select Safari as Application.  Then enter the exact name of menu command (In your case: codeFindâ€¦/code) and enter your preferred hotkeys (kbdControl/kbd + kbdF/kbd on the screenshot)   <comment362123> somhow it works on this page but does not work on youtube page. go figure... <comment362124> could it be some moron who wrote javascript at google took some liberty to disrespect macos system shortcuts? <comment362125> not only that but ctrl + f works identically to %f : it gets me to fullscreen. duh! <comment362131> Default for fullscreen in Safari is cmd/ctrl/f - so something must already have overwritten it. Cmd/f doesn't fullscreen in Youtube for me. <comment362137> any way to troubleshoot this? I can't find a way out of this dire predicament <comment362138> What does it actually say at the bottom of the View menu? cmd/ctrl/f or just cmd/f? Not sure how to troubleshoot - unless you know you have some kind of key-replacer app running. Maybe look where Andrey says in his answer & see if there's already a replacement listed [there shouldn't be, by default] <comment362140> Edit - Find - Find... off the safari top menu bar shows shortcut as cloverleaf F <comment362141> & what does Fullscreen say, View menu? <comment362142> ^ cloverleaf F. but it does not act like it. meaning it does not act on F when both cntrl and window keys are pressed simultaneously, It goes fullscreen when either ctrl or window(cmd) key is pressed (with f). sounds like a moronic bug in 10.12.5 or safari <comment362143> Nevermind. What happens on ^cmd F and cmf F is different. What happens is that ^cmdF puts the page containing the playback window fullscreen. While cmd F and ctrl F puts the frame with the video (video itself) fullscreen. So I fullscreen shortcut seems to be irrelevant to the issue. <comment362145> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/60516/discussion-between-anton-tropashko-and-tetsujin). <comment362146> PC keyboard. window is command in apple speak and ctrl is whatever is marked with ^ in apple shortcuts icons. <comment362147> I'd test with an Apple keyboard to be certain it's not just an incompatibility.
