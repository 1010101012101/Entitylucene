start and stop OS X router daemon <body> I'd like to be able to stop and (re)start the OS X routing daemon and review the routed configuration file(s).  I think this would involve using launchctl unload and load, but I don't know the name of the routing plist file... Any hints on how to track this down?  <answer147405> There is no OS X daemon for routed.  <comment173720> OS X doesn't run -- or even contain the binary for -- `routed`. What are you actually trying to do? <comment173800> OK, thanks... So what happens at system startup to configure the routing table? <comment173867> I can't find an answer to that @RicSteinberger. It's strange that the manpage for the route utility refers to a non-existent system daemon. <comment173869> I do know that the routed daemon used to exist in older Mac OS X Server versions, it used to be in /etc/routed. <comment173870> I believe that DHCP configures the routing table now. <comment174221> I posted a related question and got this response:  https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/147482/where-does-the-os-x-routing-table-come-from
