Why doesn't Spotlight show invisible files that I know exist? <body> I am running Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and had to edit an invisible file as part of an Android project. While I eventually found it, Spotlight was of no help, since it could not find an invisible file when searching for the exact name (.classpath) and with the 'File Visibility' option set to 'Visible or Invisible'.  Why didn't Spotlight work in this instance?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wx7w2.png" alt="Can&#39;t find .classpath file even though it&#39;s right there"  <answer96082> Though, it won't update the results in spotlight I use the below script to toggle hidden files on and off every time it's run:  To make:  ul liOpen codeTextEdit/code/li liMake sure it is in Plain Text Mode (codeFormat &gt; Make Plain Text/code from the menu)/li lipaste in the below text:/li /ul  pre class="lang-bsh prettyprint-override"code    #Load current state into I     I=$(defaults read com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles)     if [ "$I" == "false" ]       then         # Flip         I=true         echo -e "\t&gt;&gt; Showing Hidden Files"       else          # Flop         I=false         echo -e "\t&lt;&lt; Hiding Hidden Files"     fi     # Write I to com.apple.Finder.plist     defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles $I     # Restart Finder     killall Finder     exit /code/pre  ul liSave the above file to your desktop as codetogglehidden.command/code (be sure strongnot/strong to append .txt to the end of the file)/li liOpen code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal/code/li liEnter the command codechmod u+x ~/Desktop/togglehidden.command/code to make your new file executable./li liDouble Click codetogglehidden.command/code on your desktop to show or hide hidden files./li /ul  <comment112785> I used `defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall -HUP Finder` to show all of the files in the folder, though I wouldn't want to have to toggle that every time I want to search for a single invisible file.
