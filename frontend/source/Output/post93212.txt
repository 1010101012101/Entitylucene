anker keyboard escape key <body> My imac bluetooth keyboard had some keys broken so I bought an anker keyboard.  It's the one mentioned in this review:  http://ziacomputers.wordpress.com/2013/03/14/anker-bluetooth-keyboard-reveiew/  My problem with it is the same as the problem #1 in the review, the keyboard doesn't have a escape key.  The place where esc should be is an empty box symbol which you can see in this image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cLIXj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You have to press fn + box to escape. I'm trying to remap it with KeyRemap4MacBook but I can't figure out how. The review mentions that it should be possible. Any assistance is appreciated thanks.  <answer93231> Err, that's an iOS keyboard... (and the key is a Home button)  I would say that your easiest bet would be use use PCKeyboardHack (or KeyRemap4MacBook) to use the caps key was escape. I use this on my mac, as caps is normally useless anyway.   h3How to Change/h3  ul liNote that Escape's code is 53/li liLocate "Change Caps Lock", double click the key-code there, and to edit to 53/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V9Eyd.png" alt="PCKeyboardHack Screen Shot"  <answer108801> The kbdfn/kbd+kbdhome/kbd key combination works as kbdEsc/kbd.  <comment109364> thanks i'm trying to figure out the remapping. Is this correct: http://cl.ly/image/1Z0a3P182a1t It's not working? <comment109373> @Harry (I'm assuming you are taking the caps route) Note that escape's code is `53`, then scroll up and to where you should see "Change Caps Lock" and double click the key code there to edit to `53` <comment109378> yep thanks for your hlep <comment135807> I just wanted to add that the fn + home key does NOT function as ESC. I have a white version of this keyboard (or quite similar one, certainly same manufacturer). <comment175250> I have a similar keyboard, and Fn+HomeIcon keys is indeed Escape. <comment256144> Agreed, it doesn't. <comment287771> It does work if it is paired to an iOS device..
