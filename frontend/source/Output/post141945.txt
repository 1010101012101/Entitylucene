How to disable middle click paste Mavericks Terminal? <body> I have looked all over the Net and can't find a way to disable middle-click paste in the Terminal application in Mavericks? I want it scroll but not paste.   Anybody know how to fix this? I'd sure appreciate the tip.  <answer141954> You can use Karabiner (formerly known as KeyRemap4MacBook) with the following setting in private.xml:  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;appdef&gt;         &lt;appname&gt;Terminal&lt;/appname&gt;         &lt;equal&gt;com.apple.Terminal&lt;/equal&gt;     &lt;/appdef&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Disable middle-click&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;private.disablemiddleclick&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;only&gt;Terminal&lt;/only&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;             __PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::MIDDLE, KeyCode::VK_NONE         &lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment285064> This disables middle click globally, not just in Terminal.app. Is there a solution that only affects Terminal.app? <comment285066> @tubes See edit which restricts this to only when Terminal is the frontmost app. This is what I originally intended but the code to restrict it to Terminal wasn't included by the user who added the full private.xml wrapper.
