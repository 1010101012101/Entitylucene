Transfer from one iCloud account to another <body> For some reason, I have 2 iCloud accounts; one connected to my iPad and one connected to my iPhone. I want to have all my photos and data on one iCloud account, this will involve me transferring everything I have on one account and shutting the other down but it does not seem that simple.   Can anyone advise how I can do this?  <comment356782> This [site](https://blog.xojo.com/2013/06/20/merging-icloudapple-id-accounts/) may help.
