Is there any way to bring back H.264 support in Chromium <body> I'm using Chrome on a daily basis or to be exact, latest-builds of Chromium. I recently uninstalled Flash, in order to increase battery life on my MBP and in general rid my laptop of the evil Flash imply.  Now with Chromium's drop of H.264 codec support, enjoying the web is becoming harder and harder. emIs there any way to re-enable H.264 support in Chromium?/em   I know Microsoft (of all players) released such a codec plugin for Chrome recently. Safari isn't really an option although it's sweet.  <answer32016> While announced in January, Chrome hasn't actually dropped support for H264 yet.  <answer219623> There doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this. I first thought the following steps would solve the problem, but alas no!  ol liDownload and install Google Chrome v40.0.2214.91 from http://google-chrome.en.uptodown.com/mac/old/li liIn Applications, CTRL-click on the Google Chrome icon and select Show Package Contents/li liGo to /Contents/Versions/40.0.2214.91 which contains Google Chrome Framework.framework/li liIn the Finder, change to list view if you haven't already, so that you can see which files and folders are contained in the above framework/li liCopy the file ffmpegsumo.so from the Libraries folder and paste in the the corresponding folder of your Chromium app/li liUninstall Google Chrome/li liRestart Chromium/li /ol  I have found that some users have been successful using the Chromium Embedded Framework. Follow this link to head to a post on the forum detailing how to build CEF with support for proprietary codecs (namely H.264 and MP3).  On Mac, prior to building CEF by running the automated script automate-git.py, open the Terminal and set the GPY_DEFINES variable as follows:  precodeexport GYP_DEFINES="proprietary_codecs=1 ffmpeg_branding=Chrome" /code/pre  Instructions explaining how to build the CEF may be found here.  <comment36705> Out of interest, why isn't Safari an option? <comment36720> Well, since I'm on the Chromium latest builds (can't really go back because of certain new features) the support is certainly dropped. <comment36721> It lacks the profiles/users feature that was recently introduced in Chromium, that effectively gives me the ability to sandbox sites I use, Facebook for instance. Then there's also certain extensions for Chrome I can't ditch, such as Proxy Switchy. <comment36735> Then I believe for now, you should consider reinstalling Flash. I'm sure more extensions for supporting H264 will show up when/if it lands in a stable Chrome build. <comment234054> @Gerry, nearly 4 years later things haven't changed much: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/194905/14844 Unfortunately, your prediction ("I'm sure more extensions for supporting H264 will show up") didn't materialize, too bad. <comment283566> This is useful for people trying to achieve this still. Thank you! I've myself given up on Chrome/Chromium a long time ago.
