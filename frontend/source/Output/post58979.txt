Creating an Automator service to add email messages to Reminders.app <body> I've created an Automator service that creates a reminder based on the selected text.  What I really want is to create a keyboard shortcut that gets the same result that you get by dragging an email into the Reminders.app.  The service I have just uses the text to create the title of the reminder, but when you drag an email into Reminders.app it uses the subject of the email as the title and adds a link to the email its self.  Is there a way to create a keyboard shortcut for this action or an Automator service?  <answer59227> I don't have the keyboard shortcut, but I just finished an Actionscript that adds the email Subject as the Reminder Title, the email Body as the Reminder Content and then adds a link to the actual email at the bottom of the Reminder. Hope this helps!  precodeon run {input, parameters} tell application "Calendar" to activate tell application "Calendar"     set miniaturized of window 1 to true     tell application "Mail"         set theSelection to selection         set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection         set theurl to "message://%3c" &amp; theMessage's message id &amp; "%3e"         set thedes to theMessage's content &amp; "Show in Mail " &amp; "message://%3c" &amp; theMessage's message id &amp; "%3e"         set input to theMessage's subject     end tell end tell tell application "Calendar"     tell calendar "Reminders"         make new todo at end with properties {url:theurl, summary:input, description:thedes}         tell application "Reminders" to activate     end tell end tell return input /code/pre  end run  <answer62391> You can create a shortcut for a service. In System Preferences, Keyboard and Mouse, Keyboard Shortcuts: add a new shortcut for All Applications (if you want to use it everywhere). Make sure to match the services menu text exactly, including case and spacing.  <answer63278> I was able to create a service that runs an AppleScripts and can be activated with a keyboard shortcut.  First I add the strongGet Selected Mail Messages/strong action with Messages selected in the options.  Then I used the strongRun AppleScript/strong action with the following AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "Mail"     set _sel to selection     set _links to {}      set the _message to item 1 Â¬         of the _sel     set theSubject to subject of _message     set message_id to the message id of the _message end tell  set message_url to "message://%3c" &amp; message_id &amp; "%3e" set end of _links to message_url set the clipboard to (_links as string)  set theBody to the clipboard  tell application "Reminders"     set theReminder to make new reminder with properties {name:theSubject, body:theBody, priority:1}  end tell  return input /code/pre  end run  This doesn't add the body of the email to Reminders.app, but it does use the subject as the reminder's title and adds a link to the email message in the reminder's note field.  <answer126594> I collated answers from this thread and elsewhere into a "Email reply reminder" workflow which sets a reminder to reply to an email , its on github here  <comment73119> Thanks Kevin for providing this script.  I like the idea of adding the body of the message to the reminder.
