How to view Software Update history? <body> In OS X 10.8, for system updates that were installed without being signed into an Apple ID, how can I view the update history?  I looked in Library/Logs for an update log, and also in the Software Update for an Installed Software pane, but I don't have either.  Where can I see the updates?  <answer104992> It is not easy to read, but it appears to be up to date on my machine. You can find the Install history in: code/Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist/code  Wouldn't it be nice it this were listed in the Update tab of the Mac App Store?  <answer104993> It can be found in an easy to read format using the system information app:  h2System Information.app  Software  Installations/h2  System information can be found in code/Applications/Utilities/System Information.app/code or via Spotlight.  <answer200045> precode/private/var/log/install.log /code/pre    precode/Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist /code/pre  <comment123491> /Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist is it, it is just an xml file which is very easy to read if you have vim or an xml editor installed. <comment123496> Well done - I've been looking for that file and you saved me from trolling spotlight to find it. Now I might need to write a little app to parse that XML file if someone hasn't done that already. <comment123498> @bmike, the answer that Deesbek gave looks like it is just reading that file, although the answer could be a bit clearer. <comment123499> Yes - that appears to be a decent enough app to present the data. Wohoo! <comment123501> most decent text editors like vim will parse the xml for you @bmike, then it is just a matter of collapsing and expanding what you need. <comment123503> @Deesbek, AFAIK vim doesn't parse XML, it just displays it raw. I wouldn't be surprised it EMACS has a mode to parse the XML. <comment123505> @Mark AFAIK, VIM does everything! Maybe parse is not the correct word. You have to install a couple of plugins and then fold and unfold with zr and zm <comment123513> @Deesbek In that case parse is probably the right word. It sounds like what EMACS does. It's been about 20 years since I had to use vi on a daily basis, so I'm not surprised that it is still being updated.
