iCal cannot connect to localhost (Davmail) <body> I'm using Davmail as my way of connecting to Exchange 2003 on my corporate network, however while others are having success.  I am unable to set it up to work with iCal and Reminders because I receive the error that "iCal cannot connect to the server "localhost".  I am able to connect to it during the setup process and it "sees" the calendar.  I can also connect to localhost in Thunderbird w/ Lightning installed.    Any other ideas of what it could be.  The console logs are reflecting some kind of time out, but I'm not sure.  Thanks for your help in advance!  <comment75550> Nevermind, I figured this out with an experiment.  In the Davmail settings I told it to only look back "1" day for the calendar instead of "90" and it worked.  Although - it is still looking back 90 so it must be something else, but either way it is working now!  :) <comment75553> Add this comment as an answer and accept it, so that in future people with the same problem know that there is a solution.
