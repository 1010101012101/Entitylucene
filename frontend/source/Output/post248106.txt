Control key doesn't behave correctly <body> I have a Mac which was used by another coworker. I've never used a Mac computer before and I found it very hard to get used to the keyboard. I've noticed that something may be wrong with the kbdcontrol/kbd key, or I don't know how to use it properly.  I cannot:  ul liCreate keyboard shortcuts that are using kbdcontrol/kbd, /li liUse kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdU/kbd to clear the entire line in iTerm2./li /ul  I also remapped kbdControl/kbd with kbdCommand/kbd, and while trying to copy and paste it doesn't work - c and v is inserted instead of copy &amp; paste. Command behaves correctly when remapped, it's like I have two kbdControl/kbd keys right now and no kbdCommand/kbd key.  strongEdit:/strong Now I'm sure something is wrong. I remapped all keys to kbdCommand/kbd, turned on virtual keyboard to see the result and all but kbdControl/kbd are remapped to kbdCommand/kbd.  How can I check what's wrong with the kbdControl/kbd key? Why it behaves incorrectly and why I cannot remap it to kbdCommand/kbd?  <comment306231> Well most (if not all) of Mac's built in keyboard shortcuts favor **command** over **control**. iTerm should obey the control shortcut, however. <comment306254> When you say you cannot create keyboard shortcuts using control, do you mean in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts? Control is not used in most default shortcuts, as ruddfawcett mentions, but for creating custom shortcuts it is generally allowed. What shortcut are you trying to create that won't work? (Also note if you are trying to create a shortcut for a menu item, the text entered must match the menu item _exactly_ or it will not work.) <comment306460> @ruddfawcett updated my question, shouldn't remapping resolve that issue? <comment306462> @tubedogg yes, the shortcut is just not showing so I cannot save that. I think somebody messed the control key, how can I restore it to factory defaults? Please see my updated questions, remapping Command with Control doesn't help, it's like I don't have Command key at all when remapped.
