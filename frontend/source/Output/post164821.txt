Restoring iTerm2 to default values <body> I installed iTerm2, played a bit with the preferences.    Now I would go back to the initial configuration, but removing the app and finding and removing any file on the disk apparently related to the app does not help: after reinstalling, the preferences are still the modified ones.  <answer164823> I found the answer in iTerm FAQs :: Where does iTerm2 store its settings?:  precodedefaults delete com.googlecode.iterm2 /code/pre  <comment193272> How did you remove the related files?  Besides the Library/Preferences/ directory, there may also be something saved in Library/Preferences/ByHost/ <comment193275> Adding the FAQ Link would be good, for future searchers <comment193278> Maybe you also need to execute `killall cfprefsdÂ´ - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/111534/iterm2-doesnt-read-com-googlecode-iterm2-plist <comment193286> @Tetsujin: done.
