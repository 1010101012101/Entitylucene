Strange bug in MacVim 7.4 and some others apps on MacBook Retina <body> Bug (excuse me for bad quality)    Explanation: In full screen mode in MacVim 7.4 i see the background panel.  I tried codeset transparency=0/code but it does not work, Is it good to see backpanel in fullscreen vim and some other apps?  Thank you.
