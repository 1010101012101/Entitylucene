How I label scatter plot points in Numbers? <body> I have a scatter plot in Numbers using one column of data from my table for X values and another for Y values and want to label (and ideally also highlight) each point with the corresponding entries in a third column (or additional columns). How do I do that?  <answer248201> As of Numbers 3.6 on OS X 10.11, this is not currently possible.   A few alternatives:  ol liManually add text above each individual point, though obviously a huge hassle./li liUse Excel (if you have access), as this functionality appears to be supported./li liUse Google Sheets (free), which supports this feature./li /ol  Using a Google Sheet is definitely the most cost effective method of the three listed above, and you should be able to easily migrate your Numbers sheet by copying and pasting cells, or by exporting as an code.xls/code file, and then uploading to Google.  <comment306288> I have played around with this in Numbers, and unfortunately I don't think this is possible â€” arrived at same conclusion as user here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7374392?start=0&tstart=0. <comment307650> FWIW I've used Google Sheets to do this. The graphing tools aren't ask good as Excel / maybe Numbers, but it does have nice little gems like this every once in a while. <comment307657> @user1947561 Agree, Google Sheets is good for quick sheets, but I can find its graphing tools a bit cumbersome and non-intuitive (but then again, I don't use them all the time).
