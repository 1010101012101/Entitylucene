Where is the file size for "least" & "best" quality displayed when saving JPEG pictures  in Preview? <body> In the older versions, when I saved a picture with preview, the slider button for "Quality" not only had "Least" &amp; "Best" but it also told the "size" of the file. Mountain Lion does not tell me the size, only "Least" &amp; "Best". I miss the "Size". Is there any way to get it back?
