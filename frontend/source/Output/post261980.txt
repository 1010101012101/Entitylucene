Partition Type: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF Macbook Pro <body> I was trying to install Kali linux in a dual boot fashion when I accidentally ended up install a terminal only version of Debian as a second partition. So I decided to retry, which meant I needed to delete the Debian partition. When I tried to in Disk Utility, it gave me errors, so I booted into internet recovery mode and removed the partitions there. I then proceeded in clicking the Apple Logo and selecting the choose boot partition thing. It showed nothing. At first I panicked, thinking I had somehow deleted all of my data. I tried creating a second partition, so I could install Mac OS there and then fix my mac from there. I clicked on the create partition, waited 3ish hours while I went out, came back and it said preparing to partition. So I rebooted and saw that the partition type was: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFF. So I installed Mac OS X onto a painfully slow flash drive (15-20MB/s) and then looked up my problem. I found other solution people had created only they were specific to the exact case. I do not know what the partition type is supposed to be so here is my info: /dev/disk1 is the USB flash drive that is running MAC OS X so I can use my laptop.  precodesh-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI NO NAME                 209.7 MB   disk0s1    2: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF               450.1 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *31.4 GB    disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Fixer OS                30.5 GB    disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3 /code/pre  And here is some more:  precodesh-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0     start       size  index  contents         0          1         PMBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2         32         Pri GPT table        34          6                 40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640  879039128      2  GPT part - FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF 879448768   97656259          977105027         32         Sec GPT table 977105059          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  How can I mount this partition again? Which command should I use?  <answer261982> Sorry for my previous non-answer, reading fail on my part.  You can use codegpt/code to change type UUIDs on partitions, by removing the GPT record and re-adding it with a different type. (codegpt/code requires exclusive access to do it, so you must boot from another drive/internet recovery) You just need to copy verbatim the starting sector and size.  in your case, that would be:  precodegpt remove -i 2 disk0 gpt add -b 409640  -s 879039128 -t hfs disk0 /code/pre  <answer261983> To add an answer strongexactly/strong fitting to your case I slightly modified my answer in the linked "duplicate" and posted it here again.  hr  The second partition of your internal disk got the wrong partition type, your data probably won't be lost.  A bootable OS X partition (except the Recovery HD) either has the GUID 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a standard OS X partition or the GUID 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC for a CoreStorage partition. The FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF is an unknown partition type (but not strongno partition/strong like the 000000-0000-0000.... one).  The first block of a standard OS X partition doesn't contain non-zeros, the first block of a CoreStorage partition contains some non-zeros. To get the first 3 blocks of a partition enter codesudo dd if=/dev/diskXsY count=3 | hexdump/code.  The GUID can be modified with codegpt/code.  hr  ul liBoot to "Fixer OS"/li liOpen Terminal/li liGet an overview with codediskutil list/code/li liGet an overview of your internal disk with the disk identifier found in the previous command.
