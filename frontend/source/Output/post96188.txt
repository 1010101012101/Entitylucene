Retina Mac shows gray screen when waking up <body> This is the first time that my Retina MacBook Pro wakes up from sleep with a gray screen. After about 10-20 seconds, the MacBook falls asleep again.  Some points that might be relevant:  ol liThe only difference between power adapter and no power adapter is that with power adapter it does not go to sleep again./li liThe battery is almost full (I closed the lid last night when it was about 90%)/li liAn external monitor was not attached when sleeping it, so I don't think How to fix a Macbook that does not always draw its internal screen after waking from sleep and having unplugged external display while asleep? applies./li liI've run gfxCardStatus, almost always in "force integrated mode" (to conserve battery). And normally it wakes up correctly./li liI run VMware Fusion 4./li liAll software is up-to-date and fully patched./li /ol  I tried to plugin an HDMI monitor and switch displays with Command-Fn-F1 and Command-Fn-F2, but that did not help (it would not switch displays).  Edit: I also tried logging in (see the comment by George Garside) but that didn't work (though the password field had focus, the screen didn't fade).  Before trying to:    ul lireboot (by force a power off), /li lireset SMC /li liand/or reset PRAM/NVRAM/li /ul  What options do I have that do not loose my work?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2Uqj.jpg" alt="Gray screen when waking up Retina MacBook"  <answer96210> This is a workaround to save my work, then reboot.  Assumption: remote ssh is enabled and accessible on the Retina MacBook  Steps (note: "it" is the Retina MacBook):  ol liConnect it to power, switch it on, and make sure it is connected to your LAN/li liLogin over ssh to it through a terminal from another machine (I used a MacBook Air, but could be any machine that has an ssh client)/li liEnable screen sharing as described at Enabling OS X Screen Sharing from the Command Line/li liRemote connect through VNC to it /li liSave all your work/li liShut it down/li liStart it/li liLogin/li liInstall DeepSleep (or a free DeepSleep)/li liForce a Deep Sleep/li liWake/li /ol  It woke fine, so I hope this was a one-time issue.  <comment112932> I once had this problem - since the password field is already selected on a lock screen, I simply typed my password into the empty grey screen and pressed Enter. The grey screen faded away and unlocked successfully. I've never had the problem since. <comment112939> Good that you mentioned that: I tried it, but it failed. And I forgot to mention that in the question. Sorry (:
