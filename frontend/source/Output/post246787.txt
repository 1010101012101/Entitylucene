What is a keyboard shortcut in Keynote to edit a text object without clicking it? <body> Suppose I have a text object currently selected on a slide. I'd like a keyboard shortcut that lets me edit the text without erasing it, just like codeF2/code does in the Microsoft world. codeReturn/code is close: it enters text editing mode, but erases the contents of the text object.  Anybody have any ideas?   <comment304458> A quick workaround is to press `Return` and then `âŒ˜ cmd`+`Z`. <comment304630> Oh that is just horrifying. But yeah, I'll do that until I figure out something better.
