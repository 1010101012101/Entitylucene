External Seagate Hard drive for Mac - Compatibility <body> I am looking to purchase a Seagate External Hard Drive for my MacBook Air.  The products claims it works only with PC (windows), however, I have read multiple places that I can just format the drive and it will work fine with a mac.   1) Is this a correct statement. I assume it is but I am new to OSX and like to check.   2) What is the process to format an external drive? (Using OS X 10.9)  <answer131962> As long as the drive connects to your MacBook Air via a connection protocol that the Air supports like Thunderbolt or USB 2 or USB 3 you can format the drive and use it with your Mac just fine.  To format an external hard drive on your Mac (paraphrased from here):  ol liConnect the drive to your Mac/li liOpen codeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility/code/li liOn the left hand side of Disk Utility you'll see a list of drives. Find your external drive and select it./li liSelect the codeErase/code tab and choose codeMac OS Extended (Journaled)/code for the format and give it a name/li liPress the codeErase/code button to kick off the process./li /ol  <comment155057> It is a USB 3 drive so it will connect. Thank you for the information! <comment155097> Buyer beware! I have seen this kind of thing before where a manufacturer states only windows and even after reformatting the drive it doesn't work after a week or so. Please consider looking for something that has the official "Made for Mac" logo. A perfect example of this is at: http://www.wd.com/en/ notice that it has a different section for drives and drives for mac. If you like the Seagate then purchase it from somewhere with a good return policy <comment155267> @AndrewU. - Amazon has a good return policy. = After posting here I came across another review saying it works just fine with a mac as long as you format it first.
