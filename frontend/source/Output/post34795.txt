How can I change the default width of Finder columns? <body> I have found OS X's strongdefault/strong column width to be a bit too narrow. Is there any way to make it wider?  I know how to resize columns manually, but it's annoying to repeat the process every time I open a new folder. Can I force Finder to "remember" the new column width? Also, if this is possible, can anyone point me toward the official Apple documentation that describes how to do it?  <answer34796> In column view in the Finder, you can resize columns by positioning the mouse pointer over over the thin line that separates column panes, and dragging it to the left to make it narrower or to the right to make it wider.  To make the Finder remember the new width, hold down the option key(kbd‚å•/kbd) while dragging the pane separator to the desired width.  The best documentation I can find on this from Apple alludes to the fact that holding down option resizes "all columns at once" but does not explicitly say that this makes the change persistent.  <answer183304> Well, the "Option" key resize works and Finder seems to remember the chosen width every time you open a new window in Column view. However, that is not the most logic behaviour. I would love the Finder to automatically resize each column to the necessary width to display the items it contains. I don't understand that this is not an option.  <answer249584> I am using El Capitan. I have found the following:br kbdShift/kbd + Left click on right hand border makes width and height change.br kbdOption/kbd and Left click on right hand border reduces horizontal width from the right maintaining column width.br At the bottom of the column borders are 2 small vertical lines. Placing the cursor on these will ... kbdShift/kbd + Left click changes column width of the left side column.br kbdOption/kbd + Left click changes column width of all columns to the same size.br Using kbdCommand/kbd instead of kbdShift/kbd seems to have the same effect.  <comment39688> In column view in the Finder? <comment39691> @Daniel Exactly <comment39692> Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for. I can't believe how non-obvious it is, though. <comment39715> The option key! I keep pressing it in menus just to discover new and hidden features in MacOSX. It's as if I'm on a treasure hunt :) <comment39910> @Chris if it's exactly what you're looking for, you can accept it as the correct answer so future people with the same problem can more easily find this answer. <comment39912> @Daniel Sorry, I just forgot to come back to this question (I hate accepting answers *too* quickly). I was also still kind of hoping that someone would provide a link to the official Apple documentation on this, as well. Apple must have documented it somewhere, right? <comment39940> Adding the best Apple documentation I can find. <comment61623> This does not work on OS X Lion. :( <comment61639> @Noldorin The answer was written for Lion, and it works on my install of 10.7.4. What happens for you when you try it? <comment61640> Nada. Zilch. Incidentally, the proper way to do this is to go to View  Show View Options  Use As Default. <comment130714> FYI This broken in Mavericks as well. Holding down the option key changes all columns in the view but click on anything else in the folder and they snap back. In addition the View Options no longer has "Use As Default" <comment192299> @DanielLawson do you know how to set the default window size for Finder? <comment200575> This doesn't work on OS X Yosemite. <comment234150> Still doesn't work on OS X El Capitan <comment248628> Join me in telling them you'd like this auto-column width size too here: http://www.apple.com/feedback/ (under "OS X APPS" choose OS X for category to report in)....maybe if enough of us keep telling them, they will write some script to add to OS X! <comment305669> Tested - still working on El Capitan 10.11.6 at July 2016. <comment309648> Please reformat your answer using the proper punctuation.  As it is now, the answer is very difficult to read and understand.  I think you can provide a good answer with this info but it's very hard to read. <comment309742> Interesting. Could you provide some screenshots to show what you're talking about?
