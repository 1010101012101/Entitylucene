Can't find my project in FCP X <body> I've been working on a music video for the last two days using Final Cut Pro. I was told FCPX automatically saves the projects and so there's no need to save it. I had created this project within a library called "Music Videos" under an Event with the name of the project. While continuing to work on my project today, FCPX quit unexpectedly and restarted. When I open my library "Music Videos" I see no media, no events, and no projects within in. I also tried looking for the backups in the MacOS Movies library and found two timestamped backups from yesterday and two from today. When I opened them up, same thing -- no media, no events, and no projects.   Please help because I can't believe that these don't reside somewhere on my computer and am being hopeful that I haven't lost 2 days of pain staking work. I'm assuming that being new to FCPX, I'm just not familiar with the file management process so looking for any help to locate my missing project.   <comment333992> Take a look at [this Apple FCP X Support page](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH15847?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US) and see if it helps with the backup location.
