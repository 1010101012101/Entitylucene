Which apps support the vga adapter for iPad 1? <body> iPad 2 supports full mirroring, which is great, but I have an iPad 1. How do I find out which apps support the vga adapter on iPad 1. I have failed to find a definitive answer.  For example maps, safari, google earth, photos.  I have seen references to video and itunes supporting it, but not fully.  Which apps have you used with the VGA adapter, and which features does it support?  <answer20456> Keynote does, and works ok.   Beyond that I would not expect that any app supports it unless explicitly noted in the app's description.  It takes extra effort for the developer to support VGA output, so unless they see a market for it, they usually won't do. Even then usually you don't have the same view on your VGA screen as on your iPad.  <answer32124> I just tried it, Sketchbookx, Bamboo paper and pdf-notes work with iPad1 (not jailbroken) with VGA connector.    <comment22852> I have yet to find an app that clearly states what it supports on the iPad 1 vga output. Even keynote only vaguely mentions the adapter, with nothing specific on the iPad 1, and some reports suggest it only works when playing a slideshow. <comment34593> This question is much too broad. There is no definitive answer. <comment34907> I was hoping for a whole series of definitive answers of the form 'app x supports it and displays y and z on the vga output'. I hadn't anticipated receiving a single answer that says 'works ok'
