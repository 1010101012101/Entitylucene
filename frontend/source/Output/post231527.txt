Selection season and watched on AppleTV 4 <body> Two things I'm trying to figure out how to do on Apple TV 4:  ol liWhen I have a TV show with lots of seasons, instead of scrolling sideways through all the seasons and episodes to get to the latest, how can I select the season first?/li liHow can I toggle the watched status of a TV episode? I've tried long pressing but so far nothing happens./li /ol  Thanks
