Free presentation helper that shows keystrokes <body> Are there any free standalone presentation tools that shows which keys are pressed on screen?  KeyCastr is not available as build for users without Xcode. Only a community fork (git://github.com/bignerdranch/keycastr.git) is working on OS X 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain Lion).  Mouseposé is commercial.  hr  Related to the Windows 7 Question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3529329  <answer82546> OS X comes with such a tool.  To activate it, you should go in codeSystem Preferences/code -- codeKeyboard/code and select codeShow Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar/code, see screenshot below.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LmWS3.png" width="350" height="250"  Then in the top menu bar, ext to the clock, you should have a new icon.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0cjDy.png" width="200" height="85"  Click on it and select codeShow Keyboard Viewer/code, now each time you press a key, the Keyboard viewer will briefly display that key. You will have something similar to this:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rkdyt.png" width="250" height="100"  I hope this was what you were looking for.  <comment71791> This is a valid question, but don't forget that MousePosé is only $5. Sometimes you have to pay for good software. <comment71837> Other related questions [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52618/how-can-i-show-typing-keyboard-in-record-screen/52636) and at [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/407334/how-can-i-see-a-visual-overlay-of-shortcut-keys-ive-pressed/407340). <comment95210> Great alternative to the apps mentioned in the question! <comment95217> yes, nice one.. Not exactly what I'm looking for but indeed a good, free, on-every-mac-available alternative. It's just too big to let it enabled per default for presentations purposes. <comment95227> I use it personally a lot to find "hidden" characters. On my Mac keyboard, characters such as |\{}[], which I use a lot as developer and terminal freak, are not shown/printed. Using this tool, I can quickly spot them by pressing one of the changer keys (like Alt, etc.)
