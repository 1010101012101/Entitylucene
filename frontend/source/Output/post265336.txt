DuetHeuristic-BM and nsurlsessiond hogging CPU and Memory on MacBook Air <body> I recently updated my MacBook Air to macOS 10.12.2 and there are these two programs, strongDuetHeuristic-BM and nsurlsessiond/strong which have been hogging CPU and memory continuously:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XmkhK.png" alt="enter image description here"  This heats up the machine and has significantly reduced the battery life. I went through the logs in Console and the most common logs that I see for these processes are as follows:-  strongDuetHeuristic-BM/strong     :[     ] sumScores:38.410000, denominator:42.410000, FinalDecision: Must Not Proceed FinalScore: 0.000000}   and strongnsurlsessiond/strong     HTTP load failed (error code: -1001 [4:-2104])   NSURLSessionTask finished with error - code: -1001   Task 281 for client  will be retried after error - code: -1001   etc.  I am not sure what's causing this. My MacBook is critical to my work and this issue is causing me a lot of trouble. This has been happening the whole day, please help.  strongUpdate/strong  Had a call with the Apple Customer support regarding this, they suggested me to reformat the MacBook and it worked. The processes aren't showing up at all, the laptop is working perfectly.  <comment332701> Have you restarted your Mac? <comment332729> Many times. The issue persists.
