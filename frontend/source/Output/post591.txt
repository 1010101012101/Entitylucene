How can I get rid of Safari 5's "awesome bar"?  <body> Safari 5 came with a copycat of Firefox "awesome" bar, completing text as your type an url with history of previous title pages you've seen, and not just previous URLs.  How to get rid of this annoyance?  <answer615> I haven't tried it and I don't know if it'll solve your problem, but Shaun Inman created a Safari extension called SMRT that disables its auto-complete behavior.  <answer617> You could try the following :   precodedefault write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari4IncludeFancyURLCompletionList -bool NO default write com.apple.Safari DebugSafari5IncludeFancyURLCompletionList -bool NO # note the 5 instead of 4 in the second command. /code/pre  I know the one with code4/code exists, but I'm not sure for the one with code5/code.  At least, you could try these commands (each one or both), they won't hurt the system.  <comment18993> Does this actually work for anyone on Safari 5?
