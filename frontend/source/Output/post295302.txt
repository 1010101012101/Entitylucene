Second login screen has me locked out <body> I am locked out of my MacBook Pro. When I turn it on, I get the usual login screen which shows my username and asks for my password. I type in my password and at first, all seems right in the world--there is a progress bar as if it were logging in. But then a second login screen comes up asking me to type in both my username and my password. I cannot get past this screen. Very confused and a little distressed. I am running macOS Sierra on a late-2013 15" MacBook Pro. What am I missing?  <comment372835> Did you enable FileVault (disk encryption)? <comment372839> I did enable FileVault, yes.
