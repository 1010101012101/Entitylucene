Set a screensaver as a background for Desktop? <body> I have a really nice Matrix  inspired screensaver. I would like to have the moving screensaver to be placed as my Desktop background image.   How can I set my screensaver as a background image for the desktop ?  <answer155330> You have to open terminal and type codecd /System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources /codeand code./ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background/code. It will take a lot of resources though, so to quit it, you have to quit the terminal window.  source: TUAW and Lifehacker  <answer215811> You also can create an plist file that you place in your user LaunchAgent folder.    precode/Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist /code/pre  You than loaded at a terminal with:  precodelaunchctl load /Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist /code/pre  Or unload it with:  precodelaunchctl unload /Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/com.username.runscreensaver.plist /code/pre  Here is the content of this plist file:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;com.username.runscreensaver&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-background&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;key&gt;ThrottleInterval&lt;/key&gt; &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Unfortunately (at least under 10.9.5) the ScreenSaverEngine set the window level wrong (below kCGDesktopWindowLevel) to work correct with mission control and spaces witch leads to a few issues during restart, change screen, login and logout that leads to an invisible screensaver .   To fix this issues you need to write your own screensaver that inherits the properties of ScreenSaverEngine while running and correct the window level (eg. [self.window setLevel:kCGDesktopWindowLevel];).  <comment182673> you say it is animated ! <comment182676> here are some answers http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/60657/46541 and here http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20020824082233907
