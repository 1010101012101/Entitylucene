Is it possible to merge two health sources without losing data? <body> I am using the Health app on iOS 10.3.2 (14F5089a) with 2 Apple Watches paired. However, there are more than 2 watches listed in the Sources tab. I know that only one listing contains the data for one Apple Watch, but the other Apple Watch has 4 listings with only one marked as 'still paired'.  Is there a way I can merge the 4 listings with the least amount of data loss possible?  <answer284403> Please don't delete any Apple Watch from the sources tab if you care about your health records.  You can't merge these entries. strongIf you need to remove an Apple Watch, do. so using the Watch.app on your iPhone./strong  I have multiple entries for my Apple Watches as well listed in my sources:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KfGf.png" alt="apple health &gt; sources tab"
