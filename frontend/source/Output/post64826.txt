How do I search for a mouse that uses Mac's built-in bluetooth? <body> There are lots of wireless mice out there that work with Macs, but most require an extra USB thingy that takes up a USB port on my Macbook (and most Macbooks have few USB ports). What search terms should I use to look for a wireless mouse that uses Mac's built-in bluetooth?  P.S. I am looking for alternatives to Apple's Magic Mouse.  <answer64827> These search terms: bluetooth mouse, os x  Most Bluetooth mice work well with OS X.
