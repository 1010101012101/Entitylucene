How to make special French keyboard characters work in MS RDC? <body> I'm on a Macbook Pro with a French Keyboard. Keyboard layout works fine when connecting to Windows XP Professional but I cannot get certain keys to work:  For example strong$/strong, strong&amp;/strong, strongé/strong, strong§/strong and strong@/strong etc. work fine.    ul liForward slash code//code using kbd&#x21E7;/kbd + kbd:/kbd works./li liBackslash code\/code using kbd&#x2325;/kbd + kbd&#x21E7;/kbd + kbd:/kbd does not work./li liPipe code|/code using kbd&#x2325;/kbd + kbd&#x21E7;/kbd + kbdL/kbd does not work. /li /ul  Is there any configuration that I can do to make my keyboard work?  I've had this issue on my Windows VM in Virtual Box but fixed it with a custom keyboard layout. However when connecting to servers and workstations over the network this is not a solution since I can not configure each machine I need to connect to.  Under preferences, if I disable the Alt key it still does not work and on-top of that working without an Alt Key in Windows is no fun.  <answer17915> In the case of backslash kbd\/kbd, the problem is a difference between where Macintosh French keyboards put the backslash (which is kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd:/kbd), and where Windows French keyboards put the backslash (which is kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd8/kbd).  Since the way Remote Desktop works is that scancodes, not characters, are sent to the remote system, you have to honor the Windows keyboard and press kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd8/kbd to get a backslash.  Pipe kbd|/kbd is kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd6/kbd  I was able to debug this using the on-screen keyboards, which both Macintosh and Windows support.  <answer38642> I press left kbdctrl/kbd + right kbd&#x2318;/kbd + right kbd&#x2325;/kbd key on my mac to imitate kbdAltGr/kbd when using remote desktop to a windows computer  I can type special characters and shortcuts that need the kbdAltGr/kbd key on the remote PC.  <answer72223> In windows symbols can be inserted by pressing Shift + relevant number key to insert symbol.  When using a macbook on Microsoft Remote Desktop connection, you are required to Hold down Cmd + Shift + Number Key.    This is the hidden option for inserting symbols into Windows machines over Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection.    <comment19586> Is the Windows system you're connecting to set to use a French keyboard? <comment19587> Yes, windows places it to (FR) on login <comment19588> If I switch to EN I have to press shift-dollar to get a backslash. Would prefer a French layout :) <comment19589> Another test I tried that does also not work: Connecting from my XP VM via Remote Desktop. Strange that it does not work since in the VM my keys are mapped to work. <comment19594> I could get a backslash using Ctrl+Alt+8... The Windows on-screen keyboard is helpful for figuring out what's going on <comment19671> Still does not work for me. Seems the right-alt scancode is ignored when sent from my Mac. The only way I could get it to work is to use the kebyboard layout editor to map pipe to Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L. It seems Mac Alt is always translated as plain Alt and Alt Gr is gone. <comment19682> I've reset my keyboard layout and it works now as the you suggested. But that's the "traditional" french layout. <comment19912> I'm interested in making the mac combo Alt-Shift-/ (for backslash) work via RDC. Thanks to Joel I'm close by pressing Crtl-Alt-8 etc.
