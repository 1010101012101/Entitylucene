How can I show my windows in a non-mirror display (connected to a projector)? <body> The title is phrased pretty badly. It would be great if someone can improve it. My English is bad.  Situation:  I am going to do a presentation about my app. During the presentation, I need to switch to my iPhone simulator window (for doing demonstrations) and Keynote a few times.  I know that when the mac is playing a Keynote presentation, the screen that the audience sees is different from what I see. I can see the presenter's notes and stuff but the audience can't.  Problem:  When I connect my mac to a projector using a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter, I cannot see anything except my desktop background on the projector screen!  I know this is because I did not check the "Mirror Displays" checkbox in the Display section of System Preferences. If I check "Mirror Displays", I can see my iPhone simulator and everything. But if I mirror the displays, I can't see the presenter's notes!  If you don't understand what I mean, I summarised my question:  What I want:  (1) Be able to see my presenter's notes while the audience cannot.  (2) The audience and I can both see the iPhone simulator window  If I turn "Mirror Displays" off:  ul li(1) is achieved/li li(2) is not (The audience can only see the desktop background)/li /ul  If I turn "Mirror Displays" on:  ul li(1) is not achieved (Both the audience and I cannot see the notes OR Both the audience and I emcan/em see the notes if I choose "Rehearse Slideshow")/li li(2) is achieved/li /ul  How can I achieve both (1) and (2)?  Note: I don't want to buy any adapters or cables or stuff like that.  Alternatively, I can write an apple script and run it in the automator whenever I press a shortcut key. That apple script will toggle the mirror displays option. But I know nothing about apple script. If someone can do that, it would be great!
