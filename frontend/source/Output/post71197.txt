iMessage Conversation Freeze <body> I was messaging a friend then suddenly it gave me an error saying the message was not sent and I had to re-try sending the message. Since then, my iMessage freezes if I go into that same message. I cannot delete that conversation because if I go back (does not freeze if my screen is not in a conversation) and press edit then delete, it reappears every 5 seconds. This one conversation seems to be the one with the glitch.   iMessage opens at that specific broken conversation by default. So I have to tap back within 1.5 seconds before it freeze to go to my list of conversations.   I have an iPod Touch 4G and my software is updated to iOS 6.1.   I have tried:  ul liForce close/li liDelete all conversations/li liRestart iPod/li liTurn off and back on/li liClear messages in that conversation within 1.5s (I cleared it but still freezes)/li liSend new messages/li liPower off my iPod for 24 hrs./li /ul  strongIs there a way to delete that conversation on my macbook?/strong  <comment86088> I am still experiencing this problem. <comment87896> Anybody?
