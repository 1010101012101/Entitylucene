Does the Programmer's Dvorak keyboard layout work on Mountain Lion? <body> I see that Mountain Lion has come preinstalled with 4 versions of the Dvorak keyboard layout. I do not think these versions are "Programmer's Dvorak." I found a version of this layout here: http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/  After installing it I had no luck finding it in my System Preferences. Does anyone know if this layout is available under Mountain Lion?  <answer60604> It does seem to work on 10.8, but you have to log out and back in after running the installer.  <answer252009> You should run codesudo rm -f /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.IntlDataCache.le*/code in order to invalidate layout caches, and then you will see Programmer's layout in the list.
