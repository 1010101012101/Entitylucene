iphone - is the hotspot isolated (can you see other devices)? <body> When I turn on the Apple hotspot feature, is it an isolated network, or can I see other devices on it?  Can I use it to connect a third device to a Chromecast?  As in tablet - iPhone with hotspot (and cellular data off) - Chromecast?  I want to use a Chromecast while on holiday!  <answer194986> Personal Hotspot is designed for sharing a cellular data connection, not for acting as a wireless access point or router. This means that multiple devices connected to the same iOS device cannot connect to one another - they can only access the Internet (assuming the cellular data connection is active). Unfortunately I can't find any Apple documentation to confirm this, but have seent his from personal experience.  Your best solution is to purchase a portable wireless access point and connect all of your devices to that.  Hootoo makes a dependable and well supported line of travel routers starting at $20. Models get better features and even built in batteries for another $10 and $20 respectively.   ul lihttps://www.amazon.com/HooToo-Wireless-Performance-TripMate-Hotspot/dp/B00HZWOQZ6/li /ul
