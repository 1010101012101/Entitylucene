How to access user installed menubar icons with the keyboard? <body> I understand that KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDF8/KBD can be used to access the built-in Apple menu and KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDF2/KBD can be used to access program menus (e.g. this existing answer).  However, I have a bunch of user-installed items in the menu bar (e.g. Better Touch Tool, Caffeine, Alfred, Dropbox, etc.) and neither of the above key combinations allow access to these items.  How can I access the user-installed items in the menu bar using the keyboard?   <answer111581> Unless they've been implemented in the right way, I don't think it's possible. I can access iStat Menus' stuff with the keyboard and that's definitely 3rd party. The others are inaccessible.  Posting my comment as a real answer following Deesbek's suggestion.  <answer248219> Install Bartender. I'm a huge fan for emmany/em reasons; but amongst those, it allows Spotlight-like quick-filtering of menubar items:  h2code⇧⌘␣/code …/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MrcsL.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2… codedrop/code …/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gfo0z.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2code↩/code!/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LCRzJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Look, ma! No mouse.   <comment80698> Unless they've been implemented in the right way, I don't think it's possible. I can access iStat Menus' stuff with the keyboard and that's definitely 3rd party.
