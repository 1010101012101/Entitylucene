The answers did not provide a way to access the Keychain password generator, but did suggest some alternatives.  A Google search for codemac terminal password generator/code also shows several ways to generate a password from Terminal. I have listed a couple below.  precodeopenssl rand -base64 6 /code/pre  You can change code-base64/code to code-hex/code to limit the use of special characters. The code6/code indicates the lenght of the password.  precodeenv LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" &lt; /dev/urandom | head -c 10 /code/pre  The code"a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?"/code part indicates allowed characters and the code10/code defines the length.
