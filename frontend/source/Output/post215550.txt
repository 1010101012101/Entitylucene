Missing .bash_profile and .bashrc files <body> I don't have code.bash_profile/code or code.bashrc/code files and I am definitely using the bash shell. I am using Mac OS X 10.11.1 El Capitan.  How do I permanently modify my code$PATH/code to cut down the default values Apple ships?  <answer215552> code.bash_profile/code and code.bashrc/code do not have to exist for code$PATH/code to work, they're for bash configuration. According to the bash docs,     When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file code/etc/profile/code, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for code~/.bash_profile/code, code~/.bash_login/code, and code~/.profile/code, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.   ul liTo add a path to your code$PATH/code variable for a single terminal session, do so as follows: codeexport PATH=$PATH:pathToYourDirectory/code, for multiple directories codeexport PATH=$PATH:pathToYourFirstDirectory:pathToYourSecondDirectory/code .../li liTo see what's in your code$PATH/code: codeecho $PATH/code or codecat /etc/paths/code/li licode/etc/paths/code is the file that holds your system path variables/li /ul  Run codeman path_helper/code for more information.  <comment260378> What have you tried - have you tried creating a .bash_profile and .bashrc (note no _) <comment260379> No I haven't. My $PATH variable is set, though. Where is it getting those settings from? I need to remove something from it. <comment260381> That is a different question - and has been asked many times <comment260382> @Mark link please? <comment260393> I don't think it's necessarily a duplicate of the linked question. I flagged the answer as unclear and the OP should specify what exactly to remove because there are a lot of different methods to add (and remove) paths to (or from) $PATH. <comment260397> @Mark that only changes it for the session, not permanently. I need to know the location where these path variables come from because they are pointing to places that no longer exist. <comment260400> @Dan, see http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files -- there are "global" config files that get sourced. <comment260410> Thank you @glennjackman that link solved my issue: "When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable." <comment260411> It was in `~/.profile` which I didn't know existed nor to look for. Most tutorials online asking to modify $PATH never mention this file, only the previous two. Thank you. <comment260775> @Dan Well done with the edits. I've nuked most of the temporary comments.
