Both: Key Repeat & Press and Hold <body> Is it possible to use strongboth/strong the Key Repeat &amp; the Press and Hold functionality in OS X Mavericks? How?  I write in English, French and German on a Macbook's US keyboard often. I really like the Press and Hold accent popups, but I also need the Key Repeat functionality to work decently with iTerm2, ssh, vim, sublime and so on.  <answer122600> For every app you want key repeat to work in, run  precodedefaults write &lt;bundle-ID&gt; ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false /code/pre  supâ€¦then restart the app./sup
