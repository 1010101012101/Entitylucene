Disable battery warning for bluetooth keyboard and mouse <body> I would like to disable the extremely annoying notification popups when my bluetooth mouse or keyboards batteries are getting low. I have enough rechargeable batteries in my drawer, so I do not need a prior notification.  Basically my problem is similar to this older question, but in newer OS versions, the notification center is being used instead of a blinking bluetooth icon.  I've already checked Notification Center's preferences, but could not find any entry to disable the battery warnings. The Keyboard and Mouse settings do not seem provide any options either.  To clarify: I strongnever/strong want to see this part again:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3u3rY.jpg" alt="Battery notification"  (image from here)  <comment312682> So - you're saying if we can't stop the alert entirely, let the alerts fire but see if we can prevent Notification Center from that portion of the alerting? <comment312685> Not sure whether I understand you correctly, but I've edited my original question. <comment312702> Apparently there is no way to do this currently: http://www.macworld.com/article/3024515/macs/how-to-disable-mouse-and-keyboard-low-battery-warnings-you-cant.html <comment349383> Who ever invented these "low battery" warnings over at Apple should be shot and their ashes scattered to the four winds. My batteries have been showing as "low" for months now and the keyboard is still working.
