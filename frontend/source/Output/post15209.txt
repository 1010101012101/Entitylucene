Why can't I upload pics on certain sites <body> I can't upload pictures on sites from my iPad 2 . I was trying to upload a picture of a part that I needed and it would let me .  <answer15245> You can't upload files from any iOS device because apps can't access files from other apps. Since shared files, such as the photo library, are available from all apps, Apple could have chosen to let you upload photos, but for whatever reason they decided it was better to not have uploads at all.  <answer15252> Mobile safari does not have access to data from the camera roll or photo application by design.  iOS doesn't have a common space to store files like computer users have come to expect. Instead, each app is "sandboxed" and can only see the data it created/downloaded. Apple provides API for one program to request data from another. Mobile Safari would need to have hooks to allow a web site to ask to use the photo chooser for image upload to work. So the design makes it hard to upload files in the way most web sites expect on iOS.  The best you can do is use another app like the flickr app to push photos to the internet and then link back or upload from a URL. It's clumsy but works without you waiting for mobile safari to change (assuming it ever does change).  <answer17940> I found this new app:  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/webuploader/id448687892?mt=8  That is the center app you want  <comment16450> we're going to need a lot more information to help you out. Exactly what went wrong? What was the unexpected behavior, and were there any error messages? Also, what sites is this a problem with? Thanks. <comment16755> Apple has made clear to developers that apps are sandboxed is primarily for security and secondarily for stability/performance. <comment64285> Thanks for your answer, Jerry!
