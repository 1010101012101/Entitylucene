I am no longer able to burn discs using my MacBook's SuperDrive. How can I fix it? <body> About a year ago, the SuperDrive in my 2010 MacBook appeared to stop working. When I insert a blank CD or DVD, the disc does not show up in the Finder. The drive appears in Disk Utility, and I am able to eject it from there. I assumed this was a hardware problem with the SuperDrive, so I just purchased an external Samsung USB DVD drive. I am seeing the exact same behavior with it. strongThis leads me to believe there is some kind of OS X problem rather than it stemming from the drives./strong  What steps should I take to troubleshoot and try to fix this?  <answer50368> I reset the SMC and the SuperDrive is working again.
