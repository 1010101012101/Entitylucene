Apple Maps Doesn't Rotate <body> I just installed Mavericks, but when I open Maps, the two-finger rotate gesture does nothing. The gesture is active in System Preferences. The compass does not appear in Maps. I can use the same gesture in Preview. The pinch-to-zoom feature works fine. Is this a hardware issue or is there something I forgot to activate?  <comment141341> What view are you using? Satellite view or Flyover or any other? <comment141633> It doesn't work for any view <comment141677> I usually use Hybrid, but the point is that NO view works. <comment141678> Can you rotate when holding down the alt key and moving with one finger? <comment141701> No. I've been told previously that this was a bug and I should get an Apple Genius appointment, but I wanted to check if anyone else had a different answer.
