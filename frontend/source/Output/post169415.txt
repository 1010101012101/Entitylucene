Where are the iCloud Drive icons located? <body> For example, I need to know where the Automator folder icon is. I want to use it for a thing.  Most system folder icons and stuff are in code/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/*/code But these folder icons are not. Where are they located?  <answer169416> I think you are looking for either of the following files:  precode/System/Library/PreferencePanes/iCloudPref.prefPane/Contents/Resources/iCloud.icns /code/pre    precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder/Contents/Resources/iCloudNoDocs@2x.png /code/pre  Without clarification I can only guess what you want but I think I figured out that you want the folder icons shown within iCloud Drive. It seems like those icons are just a generic folder icon with the relevant app icon superimposed on top of it.
