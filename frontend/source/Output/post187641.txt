OSX default file permissions when copying/saving files <body> Every time I save a file from a web browser or copy files from our local server to my machine, the default permission "for everyone" is set to codenone/code. I'm a web developer. Files that are non-readable will not be displayed when accessed from an Apache server.  That means I always have to go through every file manually and change their permissions.  Is there a way to tell OSX that all files should be readable?  <answer187643> From the terminal you can use the codechmod/code command to change permissions. In this case the command would be codechmod a+r */code. This would change all files in a folder. If you want to do this from the Finder, you would have to create a service. You could then select a group of files and change all of them at once. The instructions are given below.  ol liOpen the Automator application./li liSelect "Service" and click "Choose"./li liDrag the action "Run AppleScript" to where it says "Drag actions or files here to build your workflow"./li liSet "Service receives selected codetext/code in codeany application/code" to "Service receives selected codefiles or folders/code in codeFinder/code"./li liReplace the code  precodeon run {input, parameters}      (* Your script goes here *)      return input end run /code/pre  with  precodeon run {input, parameters}     try         repeat with currentfile in input             try                 do shell script "chmod a+r " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of currentfile             end try         end repeat     end try     return input end run /code/pre/li liSave service as "Readable by All"./li liQuit the Automator application./li /ol  The service should have been saved in the code~/Library/Services/code folder under the name codeReadable by All.workflow/code. If not, move it there.  Now when you highlight one or more files using the Finder application, you can right click and select "Readable by All" to change the permissions.  <comment221875> why on earth is that even the default permission? I thought that's the mistake here? <comment221881> @Sumit: Ok, I am curious. If you open a Terminal application window and type the command `umask -S`, what do you get. I get `u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx`. <comment221895> same for me. `u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx` <comment221904> Sumit: Your defaults are set correctly. the letter `u` stands for user (you), `g` stands for group (staff on my machine) and `o` stands for other (which is everyone). The letters `r`, `w` and `x` stands for read, write and execute, respectively. Your files should be saved with everyone set to read. Someone with more experience than me is going to have to answer your question. The only thing I can suggest a automatic action which would append the everyone read permission each file added to given folder. <comment221905> thank you for digging into it. An automated service is not what I'd want to do here as this is such a ridiculous issue that it has to be a mistake somewhere.
