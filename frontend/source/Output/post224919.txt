Video playback effects in Safari different from other browsers OS X <body> I am testing html embedded videos in OS X Safari browser and have come across the following issue.   Here is a video link from the page: http://realestate.xitech.com.au/barryplant/17491  In Safari, when I click to play the video, the video flashes at the start with a zoom in effect. This happens at the moment the video starts playback and is present only in safari in OS X. Can we know how to fix this issue, we need the video to play without any effect whatsoever from the start.  If you go to this link from any other browser in your mac except Safari, it will work fine.  <comment272853> I guess the link is missing... <comment272993> added link. sorry i forgot that
