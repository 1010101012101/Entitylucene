iPhone 4 boot loop, nu DFU possible <body> please excuse, I am new to iPhone, as I repair it for a friend.br It's an 4S from USA that some other friend of him wanted to unlock for germany.    So I don't know what he did exactly, but:br When I restart by holding home+power, it restarts like expected. The apple appears for 2 minutes, then the (respring?) turns 180 degree and then stops.br There's also no way to get it into DFU mode, it boots no matter if I hold the home button.br Also when I hold vol+, it won't boot.    So now I have no idea, and hope somebody can help.  Thanx,br David.  <answer131041> I could fix it with some luck now.br I didn't restart by holding power+home for 7 seconds.    I pressed them for about 5 seconds, until the screen turned off.br Then I held the home button, and connected it to a pc withouth iTunes installed. (This didn't work with a pc with iTunes!)br Now it asked me to connect to iTunes, so I connected it to another pc having iTunes installed.br After iTunes finished restoring, the phone worked perfect again.  <comment152456> Now I shutdown by holding pwr+home for 7 seconds. Held the home-button while connecting to the pc. Now it's in restore mode...
