Import date of a certificate into keychain? <body> I have a certificate in my keychain, and i need to see when did i introduce it.  I can't seem to find a way to so. The properties of the certificates don't include that. Is there a log of keychain events somewhere that could help or anything?  Thanks  <answer129210> h2Keychain Dump/h2  There is no automatic history of the Keychain kept on Mac OS X. You can see everything stored within a keychain file using the following command:  precodesecurity dump-keychain ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain /code/pre  h2authd.log/h2  A rotating log of authentication related actions is kept. This may have logged the granting of rights needed to import the certificate. It is unlikely but the only place Mac OS X, by default, logs authorization and authentication related activity.  You can see the log using strongConsole.app/strong within the code/var/log/authd.log/code range of files.  <comment151229> What time period might the certificate have been imported – days ago, months ago? Do you have Time Machine back-ups for this time period? <comment151230> no higher precision? No i don't have Time Machine ON, it's OFF <comment151232> I wondered if searching through Time Machine keychains would be possible. It is not in this case. <comment151926> Thanks, but none proved useful <comment151939> So without regular back-ups, it appears there is no way to determine when the certificate was imported. <comment151972> so far, that what it seems
