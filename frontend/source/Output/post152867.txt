Youtube in Safari cause system crash <body> Regarding MacBook Pro early 2011: sound loop, black screen  It happened again and it's the 5th time in one month. Everytime I play strongyoutube videos on Safari only/strong the screen just freeze and the fan gets much louder.  I forced it to shut down and when I turn it on again I got black/grey/blue screens..  Is the Flash Player the main source of problem here? I updated it to the latest version.   <answer152869> First thing I would always try for Flash issues is to disable Hardware Acceleration...  Right click any Flash video &amp; select codeSettings.../code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QAZMQ.png" alt="Flash Settings"  Then click the first tab at the bottom &amp; uncheck codeEnable hardware acceleration/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPVmN.png" alt="Hardware Acceleration"  <comment179975> Thanks for the tip, I will do that once my school break is about to end; I need a stabile computer to finish my work :)
