Do any Apple Products Support HDCP 2.2? <body> I've found a few questions on here that are several years old and ask about general HDCP support.  However, with the oncoming 4k revolution a new version of the specification, HDCP 2.2, has been introduced specifically to lock down 4k content.  For instance, in order to stream Netflix at UHD quality, your display (and cables/connections) must support HDCP 2.2.  From the Netflix UHD Help Page:     Please note that both the HDMI cable and the HDMI port on your TV must be HDCP 2.2 certified.   I'm having a hard time finding any hard facts on this.  Mostly I'm curious about my current device, a 15" Mid 2014 MBP with an Nvidia GT 750M and retina display.
