clear Safari cache from script <body> Here is a Python script that clears cookies from Safari (OS X):  precodefrom Foundation import * store = NSHTTPCookieStorage.sharedHTTPCookieStorage() L = store.cookies() print len(L) for c in L:     store.deleteCookie_(c) print len(store.cookies()) /code/pre  Is there a similar API to clear Safari's Cache and LocalStorage?  <answer47857> For the cache, you would be looking at codeNSURLCache/code and the method(s) coderemoveAllCachedResponses/code and coderemoveCachedResponseForRequest/code  For the LocalStorage, there does not appear to be an API for talking directly to Safari LocalStorage except through JS.  I did find this AppleScript however which basically circumvents the API and deletes the SQLite databases directly, obviously replace USERNAME with your username.  tell application "Finder"  precodeselect every item of folder "LocalStorage" of folder "Safari" of folder "Library" of folder "USERNAME" of folder "Users" of startup disk move selection to the trash end tell /code/pre  Finally, there's a project on SourceForge called SafariCleaner which does all that you are trying to do in a set of AppleScripts.  <comment54883> Thanks for the answer.  I explored this more at length here:  http://telliott99.blogspot.com/2012/04/ive-been-annoyed-with-safari-for-while.html.
