Will VOX music player change anything in my iTunes library? <body> I've downloaded the free VOX music player from the Mac App Store after reading a recomendation in some site.  The program asks me for permission to acces my iTunes Library but a splash screen hints of some lenghty process is going to happen is I do so.  ul liHas someone used VOX, and what does is do to my iTunes Library ? /li liDoes it create its own library of sorts ?/li /ul  <answer98956> I have not used it, but from what I have read it imports your iTunes library to use as a source. See this thread on MacRumors.  <answer98958> From what I see using Vox, it does strongnot/strong create a library of its own, instead it either access the iTunes Library directly for information.  It should be a read-only access, and you have nothing to worry.  You should note that it's not iTunes integration, so it does strongnot/strong work with iTunes Match to provide tracks that aren't downloaded to your Mac yet.  If you have further concerns, I suggest you contact the developers of Vox directly.
