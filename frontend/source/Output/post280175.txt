Can't enable iCloud Drive on OS X Sierra <body> Can't enable iCloud Drive on OS X Sierra. Going to codeSys. Preferences &gt; iCloud/code , can enable every feature, but not iCloud Drive. Can't enable it and icon has a fade out effect. Tried to log out and login again - didn't worked.   img src="https://image.ibb.co/dRHKJ5/Screen_Shot_2017_04_09_at_10_56_46_PM.png" alt="iCloud settings"  What could be the problem? My Mac was issued me by my company - could they block that feature?  macOS Sierra 10.12.5 Beta (16F43c)  <answer280253> This is strange indeed. Have you tried booting in Safe mode?   Start up while holding the left shift key.   <answer280255> These ports need to be open on your company's firewall/security appliance to allow iCloud in general:     To allow iCloud to function, Apple has a list of ports which need to be allowed for iCloud to function on your client devices. The ports used by iCloud are:      TCP 25      TCP 80      TCP 443      TCP 587      TCP 993      TCP 5223   See this Meraki page for more details. Your company's IT group should be able to tell you if these ports are blocked. Which specific port blocks iCloud Drive is not clear.  <answer280259> ol liWhat happen when you try to access via Terminal?

Search domains - how are they involved here? <comment352571> 1. output: `$ cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs -bash: cd: /Users/dmitry.mihailov/Library/Mobile` <comment352574> didn't help at all. At least I know about the safe mode - thanks! <comment352587> did you use to pay for more storage and than stop to pay apple? example did you request more GB previously ? I will also try https://getsupport.apple.com/ <comment352614> iCloud is still not available. I think it was "removed", as I can't find iCloud path lurking through terminal: `$ cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs -bash: cd: /Users/dmitry.mihailov/Library/Mobile` <comment360171> I got to the support, they've took remote control of my Mac... and no results. I think may it's because of Beta OS I have installed.
