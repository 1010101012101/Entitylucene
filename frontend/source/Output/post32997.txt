Notifications sounds not affected by iPad 2 volume <body> When turn down the volume on my iPad 2 all the way down, It still makes a sound when notifications are received. Is there any way to globally disable notifications sounds ?  <answer32999> In strongSettings | General | Sounds/strong, you can either set the sound level of the alerts, or choose that it will be affected by the Volume buttons (which is off by default).  h3Update/h3  In iOS 10 (and maybe earlier versions, I'm not sure when the change happened) this setting is under strongSettings | Sounds/strong and is called emChange with Buttons/em in the emRinger and Alerts/em section.
