Why do I need to press C twice to copy in Mac MS Word 2011 and 2016? <body> I have had this issue for years with MS Word 2011. I upgraded to MS Word 2016 and am still having the same problem. I can only copy if I press command, then double press C while holding down command. Just pressing command-C does not add anything to my clipboard.   How can I fix this? This problem has continued to haunt me for years, even after I did a factory reset on my Macbook, have upgraded Mac OS X several times and also upgraded MS Office. Thanks for the help.  If I hold down command-C for a second, I only have to press it once. Regardless of how long I hold it down, I see the Edit menu in the filebar flash blue... even if it doesn't copy anything to the clipboard after the first (or sometimes even the second) button press.  <answer294755> Please loot at this: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_mac/often-have-to-cmd-c-twice-to-copy-mac-office/0a3060eb-d185-46df-943d-3ed89f447d25?auth=1  When I disabled the emthree fingers drag/em, the problem have solved.  <comment345978> This is a wild guess but will only take a minute to check. Open the keyboard viewer, from the menu bar or system prefs  keyboard show keyboard, emoji... etc & check you don't have a dead-key. Normally dead-keys would be on the Option key. Try it & watch the dead-keys turn orange. Make sure the same isn't happening on Cmd. <comment345980> No, neither command nor C is a dead key. <comment345983> OK, next guess - make a new admin account on your Mac & test it in that, at default settings. See if it's some kind of 'personalisation' in a single User in Office. <comment372048> Could you edit your answer and provide a summery of the solution offered at the website you link to?
