Why is Terminal complaining "-bash: export: `PATH;': not a valid identifier" <body> When I start terminal I get the error      -bash: export: `PATH;': not a valid identifier     Why?  I've looked in the two files which I think bash uses at startup, and I cannot see an issue:  strong/etc/profile/strong  precode# System-wide .profile for sh(1)    if [ -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ]; then           eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`   fi    if [ "${BASH-no}" != "no" ]; then           [ -r /etc/bashrc ] &amp;&amp; . /etc/bashrc   fi   /code/pre  strong~/.bash_profile/strong  precodeexport PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/autoconf/bin"   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/automake/bin"   export VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)   /code/pre  (N.B. The file code/usr/libexec/path_helper/code is binary, and code/etc/bashrc/code does not contain the text 'PATH'.)  Where is the error coming from? I cannot see codePATH;/code with the trailing semicolon in either startup profile.  <answer272495> Just to turn fd0's comment into an answer, the offending line in my ~/.bash_profile file is the last one  precodeexport VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)   /code/pre  Removing that line fixes the problem and appears to have no bad effects. Sadly I cannot remember nor work out why it was there  <answer273952> Look at the output of codepath_helper -s/code:  precode$ /usr/libexec/path_helper -s PATH="..."; export PATH; /code/pre  (The actual value assigned to codePATH/code isn't important; I've elided it here.)  The output is intended to be executed with codeeval/code, as it is in code/etc/profile/code. The purpose is to provide an initial value for the codePATH/code variable, then set the export attribute on the name.  In your code.bash_profile/code, you are unnecessarily executing it emagain/em, but also incorrectly letting the output be used as additional arguments to an codeexport/code command. The line  precodeexport VISUAL=vscodeeval $(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)  /code/pre  is treated as   precodeexport VISUAL=vscodeeval PATH="..."; export PATH; /code/pre  except the semicolons are treated as literal characters, not command terminators. Thus, it tries to do the following:  ol liSet codeVISUAL/code to codevscodeval/code and set the export attribute on codeVISUAL/code. That's OK./li liSet codePATH/code to an initial value (ending with a semicolon, which would not be what you want, but syntactically not an issue) and set its export attribute./li liSet the export attribute on a variable named codeexport/code. Unnecessary, but not an error./li liSet the export attribute on a variable named codePATH;/code. That is your error, since a variable name cannot contain a code;/code./li /ol  The fix is to just remove the code$(/usr/libexec/path_helper -s)/code from your code.bash_profile/code; it only needs to be executed once from code/etc/profile/code.  <comment342121> What are you trying to achieve in the last line of your bash_profile? <comment342125> I'm not, I think that's the out-of-the-box profile. At least none of it looks familiar to me. <comment342127> But removing that line fixes things! Thanks. I wonder what added it. <comment342128> I've added this as a VS Code issue [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/20196) just-in-case. <comment343376> You should probably have a newline after `VISUAL=vscodeeval`
