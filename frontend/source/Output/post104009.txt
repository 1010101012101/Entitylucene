Is it possible to upgrade from Java 5 to Java 7 on OS X 10.5.8 - Leopard? <body> I'm using OS X 10.5.8 - Leopard. I updated Java via Software Update and the newest Java I could have installed in MacBook was Java 5. This is the screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/77ZhV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Can I somehow update Java 5 to Java 7? If so, how can I do it?  <answer104038> It seems that Java 7 will not be provided for Leopard (or even Snow Leopard), and I haven't seen any work-arounds....   Here are the official requirements and Apple's update page which matches what you got in Software Update.  <answer104082> strikeAccording the the Oracle website, you would probably not be able to install Java 7 (Java1.7) on Mac OS X Snow Leopard./strike  strikeSee this page for more info from Oracle./strike  As mentioned above, the only probable way would be a "work around" that could enable it.  hr  h3Install Java JDK7 on Mac OSX Snow Leopard 10.6.8/h3  ol liDownload the latest JDK 7 from the Oracle web site.  jdk-7u21-macosx-x64.dmg/li liI ran and mounted the JDK 7 dmg file.  A volume appeared on my desktop called JDK 7 Update 21./li liI extracted the contents of the installer using a program called Pacifist which I downloaded from charlessoft.com to a folder I created on the desktop.  You have to first click on codeOpen Package/code within Pacifist and then load the JDK 7 Update 21 / JDK 7 Update 21.pkg package.  Once you load the package, select all the contents and drag it into a folder on the desktop./li liAt this point, you'll want to navigate to the JavaVirtualMachines directory located at [hd] / System / Lbrary / Java / JavaVirtualMachines.  You'll probably see 1.6.0.jdk package already listed.  Copy this file to the desktop and rename it to 1.7.0.jdk.  Now delete the contents within the 1.7.0.jdk package.  /li liOpen  the directory where you extracted the installer contents to on the desktop.  You'll see 2 folders: JDK 7 Update 21 Folder and JDK 7 Update 21 Folder-1.  /li liNavigate to JDK 7 Update 21 Folder / Contents Directory.  There is a file called Info.plist and 2 folders called Home and MacOS.  Drag these into the 1.7.0.jdk package./li liNow open the JDK 7 Update 21 Folder-1 / Contents directory and drag everything into the package as well.  You do not need to replace any files or folders that already exist./li liNow drag the modified 1.7.0.jdk package into System / Library / Java / JavaVirtualMachines directory and double click to open it.  You should see the java preferences dialog at this point which should now list Java SE 7 as an option.  Drag it to the top and close./li /ol  If you are using NetBeans and started a project in 1.6 and continuing it in 1.7, you may need to change the Source/Binary Format located under Sources in the Project Properties.  You should see a drop down that lists JDK 6.  You need to change this to JDK 7.  When you open a Netbeans project or create a new one, you should notice the 1.7 library already loaded.  I ran the following to make sure it worked correctly:    precodepublic static void main(String[] args) {      System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.version")); } /code/pre  and the following displayed in the console:  precoderun:     1.7.0_21  /code/pre  h3Credit/h3  This work-around is credit http://timhooker.blogspot.com.au/br via: http://timhooker.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/install-java-jdk7-on-mac-osx-snow.html  <answer122976> I think that there is no way to update it up from 15, I have a iMac G5 and it has 10.5.8, and I couldn't find a way to update it because the system doesn't meet the requirements.  <comment143553> That screen shot does show a later version of Java - second row is Java SE 6 <comment143554> Hoever question is for OSX 10.5 not Snow Leopard <comment143555> The issue for you is that the processor is a PPC and all near Java VMs for OSX are for Intel chips only - the question might be answerable for Intel OSX 10.5.8 <comment143556> Java 7 idol available as a 64 but build - so I think it can not run on Leopard
