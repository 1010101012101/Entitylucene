Apple Script to Export from application <body> I'm new to AppleScript and wanted to export my citations using AppleScript. I found the following but am not sure the structure to change the following to my path folders, can you please provide an example and is this executed in the Script editor?:  precodetell application "Papers"  set outFolder to ((path to desktop from user domain) as string) &amp; "PDF Files"  export ((publication item of every primary file item) as list) as PDF Files to outFolder  end tell /code/pre  Thanks  <answer226459> To better understand the AppleScript, try breaking it down.  Within strongScript Editor.app/strong run the following:  precodeset outFolder to ((path to desktop from user domain) as string) &amp; "PDF Files" /code/pre  After running, the strongResult/strong panel will show the value codeoutFolder/code is set to. This should be a path to a folder called codePDF Files/code on your Desktop.  Does this folder exist on your Mac? If not, this is probably the cause of the problems you are seeing.  The next line in the AppleScript tells the application strongPapers/strong to export to that folder. If you have problems with Paper's AppleScript behaviour, do contact the developers; they will be best placed to help you.  h2Add a Try Block/h2  You can add a strongtry/strong block around your AppleScripts. These will provide better error messages and hopefully catch problems.  h2Changing the Folder/h2  You can add an interactive folder selection by replacing the codeset outFolderâ€¦/code line to:  precodeset outFolder to choose folder /code/pre  Alternatively, change the "PDF Files" to the name of your preferred folder.  <comment274979> This script would be run within **Applications  Utilities  Script Editor.app**. Please could you edit your question and expand on what you mean by *change the following to my path folders*. <comment274982> @GrahamMin I wanted to know am I supposed to change this script with an actual file path or just copy this script directly like it is in the script editor? Because when I do that and run the script it does not work. <comment274984> @GrahamMiln It worked. Nevermind thanks. <comment274985> Good to hear it worked. Please can you [close this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers). <comment274986> Can I change the path of the folder? If I have this folder in another directory? Thanks <comment274987> Try editing the "PDF File" constant; I have updated the answer. <comment274988> Cool thanks! Hope this helps others as well.
