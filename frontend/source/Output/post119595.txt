How to create an applescript for multiple dd terminal commands in sequence (for multiple USB Drives duplication) <body> I need to create an apple script to perform DD Commands in sequence, to replicate the same .img file to multiple USB flash drives  The context: the computer is connected to a powered USB hub with 7 usb flash drives connected and unmounted by diskutil. No other USB devices or disk are connected to the computer (so the USB Sticks will be assign a disk1 - disk7 resource mapping)  The steps  ul lia file named  "source.img" will be prepared and put on the desktop (say an .img of a bootable OS)/li literminal must be asked to change directory to the desktop/li liwith administrative privileges (the password can be inserted into the script, or asked once to the user) it must be asked to perform:/li /ul  "sudo dd if=source.img of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m"  ul lithe script must wait until the operation is concluded, then ask the terminal to perform another DD, to disk2 this time:/li /ul  "sudo dd if=source.img of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m"  and again, wait until the operation is concluded, and then ask:  "sudo dd if=source.img of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=1m"  and so on with rdisk4, rdisk5, rdisk6, rdisk7.  ul liat the end of the disk7 operation , the script can shut down the terminal and send a finder message to the user (or an audio notification) that the USB Duplication process to the 7 flash drives is concluded./li /ul  It's a way to create a "USB duplicator on the cheap" for bootable images to be put on multiple sticks, I need it for a school project to my students.  Anybody can help ? I am a zero with Applescript. And this thing will be useful for many.  Thank you ! Alberto  <answer119602> You can do this with a bash script.  precode#!/bin/bash  SOURCE="/Users/username/Desktop/source.img"  dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk3 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk4 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk5 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk6 bs=1m dd if=$SOURCE of=/dev/rdisk7 bs=1m  osascript -e 'display notification "Drives complete" with title "Complete!"' /code/pre  Make the file executable (once):  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codechmod +x ~/Desktop/script.sh /code/pre  Run it with administrative privileges:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codesudo ~/Desktop/script.sh /code/pre  <comment139508> You have a good clear specification.
