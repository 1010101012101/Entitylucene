SmartNav + Windows 7 running on Boot Camp <body> Is it possible to use SmartNav in a Windows 7 that runs on a MacBook Pro with Boot Camp? Ideally I would like to use it in a multi-monitor configuration.  <comment247812> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247813> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
