Is there any difference between the 2016 and 2017 iPhone SE? <body> Other than storage size, is there any difference between the 16/64GB versions of the iPhone SE released in 2016 and the 32/128GB versions released in 2017?  I have the opportunity to purchase a 64GB 2016 iPhone SE for less than the cost of a 32GB 2017 one. Is there any reason to prefer the newer phone even though it has less storage?  <answer280149> There are no differences apart from storage.     Apple today introduced an iPhone SE with larger storage capacities of 32GB and 128GB of storage, doubling the capacity of the 16GB and 64GB models        Other than a bump in built-in storage, the iPhone SEâ€™s other features remain identical   suphttp://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/21/14998660/apple-iphone-se-128gb-announced-pricing-release-date/sup
