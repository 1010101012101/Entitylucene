Pixelmator: I cannot open the image from Photos library that is on the external drive <body> My Photos Library is Inactive when I try to open an image from external drive, as it is on the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wi6Xb.png" alt="enter image description here"  What should I do to be able work with images from my Photos Library? My photos Library is located on the external disk.  <comment219386> Can it open images from an internal drive, inside a Library package? <comment219389> @Tetsujin yes, It can open images from internal drive wherever they are. Also Pixelmator could open the images from the Photos Library until it was on the internal drive <comment219392> ah, OK. Just wanted to be certain. All I can think to try right now is, Get Info on that drive, set it to Ignore ownership - that would eliminate possible permissions issues. After that, I'm really not sure <comment219755> @Tetsujin, what do you mean by "ignore ownrships"? When I get Info, there is no that particular checkbox, as it is usually at the bottom, under permissions... What do you suggest?
