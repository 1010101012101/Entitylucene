Search results in Notes on macOS always empty <body> No matter the search term, the search results in the Notes app on macOS are always empty:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GHVsd.png" alt="enter image description here"  This has been going on for a while. On iOS, the same searches work fine.  I have tried turning off iCloud, restarting, and then turning it on again. Didn't help.  Any ideas how to debug and solve this?  I'm on El Capitan.  <answer252397> @MacManager pointed me in the right direction. The problem was that I had excluded code~/Library/Containers/code from Spotlight. This is where Notes' data is stored.  I did this years ago way before the "modern" Notes existed and had totally forgotten about it. I wanted to stop Alfred from giving me results from that folder.  Apparently, the Notes app uses the Spotlight index for searching inside the app.   Ouch.  <comment314031> Hmm.. Out of curiosity, do things show up properly when you use Spotlight in the menu bar to search? <comment314035> Notes do not show up. Which is how I found the solution to my problem (posted as answer). I don't use Spotlight and didn't think Notes in-app search would be connected to Spotlight. Thank you so much for pointing me in the right direction! <comment314138> Nice! Yup, most search boxes use our pal Spotlight on the backend.
