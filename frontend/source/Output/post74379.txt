How to make the dock transparent in Mountain Lion? <body> When I log in as a Guest user on Mountain Lion, i get a transparent dock with no background 'surface': img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8EkTx.png" alt="Guest user&#39;s dock"  I can seem to find the settings that would make the dock in my own users' desktop look like this. Is it even possible for non-guest users?  <answer74406> You could try a program called Mirage, which should make the dock transparent.  <answer85104> To make the dock transparent in Mountain Lion type the following two commands in a terminal:  defaults write com.apple.dock hide-mirror -bool yes  killall Dock  <answer92557> Mirage (as mentioned by ekaj) is a great solution, but it is no longer being updated and the developer's site has been down for a long time. I wrote an app called MacUtil that gets the job done, look here for a short video showing it in action.     MacUtil is a customization application for the Mac. It allow you to make your mac your own, with lots of customization options ranging from two dimensional docks to modifications of CoreOS files.   <comment86389> Maybe that look is to show you visually that as a guest you can't make changes to the dock. Interesting, I wish there were a way to get that look, the "surface" is definitely not my thing either. <comment108573> Instead of a link to a video can you please add a download link for the software? That would make the answer rather more useful. <comment108784> Added the link.
