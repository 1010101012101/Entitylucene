How to restore EFI in MacBook Pro Retina 13"? <body> I've stopped an update of OS X in the middle (fair enough I am crazy!). Now all I have when I boot the system is the normal beep sound of codePOST/code for hardware check.    I've found a link that's been mentioned Apple has released a flash version of firmware update but for mid-2015 macbook 15 inches.  Now I'm stuck I don't have access to anything! I have access to an iMac in case needed.  Could someone lead me to a right direction? How should I restore the firmware?  <answer228692> Based on the chat we had, where I was able to get more details like:  ul liYou wiped out all partitions on the HDD/li liYou were getting the -2002F error during Internet Recovery /li /ul  (Both of these are key pieces of info to put into the original question, by the way. )  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rKW4pm.jpg" alt="-2002F error message"  Your only option is to reinstall OS X from boot media.  You can either take it into an Apple Store and have them reinstall or have someone you know has a Mac download OS X and create a bootable USB for you.  See the answer here - different question, but the answer is still the same:  reinstall OS X from scratch via boot media.    <comment278877> er...there's no BIOS in Macs, only EFI... <comment278879> I've gone through the whole process of resetting of `SMC` and `NVRAM` many times, but no success! I have black screen. <comment278880> Is there any other option I could try? <comment278881> Just a black screen after booting in verbose mode? <comment278882> It is black all the time. Pressing `Command+V` does not help. <comment278883> The apple logo LED behind laptop is off. Caps lock can be turned on and off. Touch pad is clickable <comment278884> Hold down option and see if it sees a boot partition. <comment278886> when should I hold down `option`? <comment278887> Neither `Recovery partition` nor `Internet recovery` doesn't work! Still a black screen. <comment278889> Turn off the machine, turn it back on while holding those keys. <comment278890> I have to add that when OS was up and running I ran `Disk Utility` and erased all the partitions <comment278892> SMH....That would be useful info to have in the original question.  Try Internet Recovery, that doesn't require a partition. <comment278893> I turned off computer and hold down these keys: `Command+Option+R` but it didn't work. When I erased all partitions I hold down `option` and it went into `system recovery` and tried to reinstall OS. <comment278894> On that situation an `earth` icon was rotating to find WIFI, It gave error multiple times and I turned off and on again until it didn't work at all and system went into black screen <comment278895> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/36166/discussion-between-alireza-hos-and-allan).
