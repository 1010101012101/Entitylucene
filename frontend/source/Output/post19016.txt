How do you turn Three Finger Drag on? <body> I'm trying to use the new "three finger drag" gesture in Lion and it's not working. There isn't a preference setting for it in TrackPad - Point and Click either. Does anyone know how to turn it on?  <answer19017> If you look under all your settings, you have the option to change to 2 or 3 finger swipe.  <answer19042> Some older Macs only support two finger scrolling on the trackpad, not three. Since you're not seeing a setting for three finger drag, I'd guess your hardware just doesn't support it.  Are you able to do other gestures that require more than two fingers? If not, it's probably a hardware limitation, and you could just get a Magic Trackpad.  <answer69944> I've been trying to figure this out as well and found it on another site , so here you go:  System Preferences-Universal Access-Mouse and Trackpad-Trackpad Options- then you have your choice of dragging with or without draglock :)  Hope this helps!

The gesture is mentioned at the bottom of this page: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4721 <comment20930> I can use, and have preferences for, the other 3 finger swipe gestures (move between spaces, Mission Control, App Expose, ect). For some reason I can't use, nor have a preference for, the 3 finger drag gesture. <comment20995> @Toph I'm not sure I can help, then. Perhaps you can take it in to an Apple Store and see if they can help. <comment81264> This is not three finger drag. That option is located in *System Preferences  Trackpad  Point & Click  Three finger drag* **only** on Macs with multi-touch capable trackpads. <comment147157> I'm on an old MBP, with a physical button with the pad. On 10.9, it supports, e.g. "look up with three fingers" tap, but not drag. Dunno why, but it's not b/c it can't recognize those gestures.
