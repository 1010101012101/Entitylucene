How to preconfigure wifi on Mac OS X (Yosemite)? <body> Does anyone knows a way to preconfigure a WPA2 WiFi network on Mac OS X (Yosemite)?  I'm preparing an iMac for a friend and would like to setup his home WiFi while currently far away from the network.  I know all the WiFi parameters (SSID, security, key) but can't manage to validate the manual setup through the AirPort wizard. I also tried to manually add the entry in Keychains, but can't manage to add the confirmation exceptions on "airportd" and "AirPort" binaries in the ACL part.  Thus, I can't setup transparently and remotely the WiFi connection.  <answer175644> ul liGo to the network preferences panel in System Preference/li liSelect airport, then 'Advanced...' /li liPress the plus button /li /ul  It will work even when the network isn't near.  <comment207330> Fast, clear, precise. Thank you for your helpful answer !
