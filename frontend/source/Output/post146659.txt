How to get filename of image used as image fill in table cell? <body> I'm designing a large photo-based book for a client and he came up with the idea to select the images to include and their sequencing by placing them roughly into a Keynote file. This sounded like a great idea in theory, but it appears that he placed the images as fills inside table cells and now I have no idea how to get their filenames.  The filename is the most important piece of information for me because I have a hard drive filled with 25,000+ images so I can't just search for the right one.   Is there any way to get the filename of an image fill inside a table cell? I know how to do this with a placed image (Image  File Info) but when I click on an image in a table cell all I get is this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6cElA.png" alt="Table cell image"  I really hope I don't have to go back to the client to ask him to do this all over—he's not very tech savvy and he's already put a lot of work into this one file.  I am using Keynote 6.2.2 on OSX 10.9.4.  <answer190354> Yes, you can find the information you need.  ul liSave the strongKeynote/strong file./li liLocate the file in strongFinder/strong/li likbd⌥/kbd+Click or Right Click on the file/li liIn the Dropdown, select strongShow Package Contents/strong/li liThere you should see a folder strongData/strong containing all the resources including images used in the file./li /ul  strongKeynote/strong files are really packages of files that the application uses to build the presentation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e7Frj.png" alt="File structure, Keynote files"  <comment320611> I had to rename the file from .key and to .zip and then extract it. I didn't have an option in the dropdown to "Show Package Contents"
