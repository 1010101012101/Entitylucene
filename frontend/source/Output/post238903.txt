Deleted photos from phone when transfering to macbook, how to get back on phone? <body> I transferred photos from my iphone to my macbook, but turns out the photos were deleted from my phone after the transfer. So now I have the photos on my macbook but not on the phone.  I'm trying to get those photos back on my phone.  I tried changing preferences such that icloud would work on my phone and macbook, but it did not work.  <answer238974> When plugging your iPhone into your MacBook, in iTunes when accessing your phone, you should be able to select 'Photos' from the Settings tab on the left, then press codeSync Photos/code, then choose the photo folder that you want to sync back into your iPhone. Then press codeApply/code.  Note: before choosing the folder, you need to create a separate folder containing all the pictures that you want to sync back.  <comment293154> Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/152394/how-to-transfer-one-photo-from-pc-to-iphone-6?rq=1.
