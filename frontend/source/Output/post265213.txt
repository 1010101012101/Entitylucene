Restoring iPad when there is no OFF button available to turn it off before restoration process <body> When I tried to restore my iPad with the process given on apple.com. My iPad does not turn off, so there is an error (6) comes again and again when trying to restore. Can anybody help please?  <comment332522> The power button is the on and off button. You need to press it for a few seconds.
