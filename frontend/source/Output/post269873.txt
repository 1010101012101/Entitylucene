Can't delete photos off my iPhone 7 Plus <body> Before purchasing my iPhone 7 Plus I was using the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. When I bought the phone the tech guy transferred all my music, photos, videos, and document from the Samsung onto the iPhone. The problem I'm having now is that I can't delete any pictures from my iPhone. Even my phone is synced with my computer, the pictures don't even show up in iTunes or on my drive. What do I do? There are over 1000 pictures that I don't want that are taking up space on my iPhone.
