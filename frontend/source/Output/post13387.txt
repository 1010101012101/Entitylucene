Is it possible to view passwords through Terminal? <body> Does anyone know how to view passwords in Terminal? Maybe by accessing the Keychain data or something? I want to be able to view passwords in Terminal with just a series of commands.  <answer13388> Check out the codesecurity/code command.  You can get detailed information about its use by reading its man entry codeman security/code  An in-depth article on the codesecurity/codecommand is here.    <answer229026> Suppose we are talking about an internet password of a site. Then you would input:  precodesecurity find-internet-password -gs www.paypal.com /code/pre  On the other hand if we are talking about a generic password, we use the command   precodesecurity find-generic-password -gs www.test_site.com /code/pre  where,  -g: is used to display the password for the item found   -a account_name: matches the account name given  -s server: matches teh server string  sources:   http://blog.macromates.com/2006/keychain-access-from-shell/ https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html
