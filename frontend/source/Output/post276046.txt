What is the minimum "delay" in AppleScript? <body> I ask this question because I've noticed that sometimes when I use codedelay/code with a sub-one figure, the delay never occurs. It is as if there was no codedelay/code line at all.  I can't identify what causes the issue and I can't tell when it will occur. The issue may not even be based on the size of the delay amount. But, I have only ever noticed a nonfunctional delay when the delay value is small.  Is there a minimum codedelay/code amount that one should not go below when writing AppleScript code?   subOS X El Capitan, version 10.11.6. /sub  <answer276053> In the AppleScript documentation for the codedelay/code emcommand/em it says "emthe number may be fractional, such as 0.5 to delay half a second/em" yet doesn't specify a stated minimum time interval, however there is an interesting discussion statement at the end of the documentation for the codedelay/code emcommand/em which accounts for the timing not being accurate.  From the AppleScript documentation for the codedelay/code emcommand/em:     delay does not make any guarantees about the actual length of the delay, and it cannot be more precise than 1/60th of a second. delay is not suitable for real-time tasks such as audio-video synchronization.   <comment347350> I consider 1/60th of a second to be pretty precise; that must not refer to the issue that I'm talking about. If there is no minimum, what would cause the `delay` command to sometimes not do anything? I'm not talking about very small numbers; I've experienced this issue with, e.g., a `delay 0.7` or a `delay 0.5`. <comment347352> @rubik's sphere, The very first part states "_delay does not make any guarantees about the actual length of the delay_"! <comment347353> I understand. But the issue exclusively occurs when the delay is small. I don't know why that is. <comment347371> Are you on battery power, by any chance? <comment347374> I am not. I am very rarely on battery power. All of the times that I have observed a malfunctioning `delay` occurred when my computer was plugged into an outlet. <comment347376> OK, I was thinking maybe it had to do with Timer Coalescing, introduced in Mavericks. That feature is only active while on battery power.
