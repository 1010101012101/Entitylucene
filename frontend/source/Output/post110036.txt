Reset Aperture Import Locations (paths for referenced masters)? <body> I run Aperture 3.5 (latest at the time of writing this) and I use referenced masters.  Over the time I've changed my directories now and then and all my files are now neatly stored on one drive in one main folder. Excellent! Now, I do have a bunch of old locations in my import location list (the list that lets you chose where to import new images into) that I don't want displayed anymore. Some even have the same name and I have to hover over them to ensure the OCD in me I'm not importing into a ghost folder that doesn't even exist anymore.  How do I clear that list or delete its entries manually?  I checked ~/Library/Application Support/Aperture, but there doesn't seem to be anything of relevance. :/  Thanks a lot in advance! :)
