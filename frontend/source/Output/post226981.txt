How do I install fuse-ext2 to use with OSXFuse <body> I'm trying to make Ext4 disk readable on mac OSX 10.10.5. I've already installed strongOSXFuse/strong, I read on this site that I also needed to install strongfuse-ext2/strong. I downloaded strongfuse-ext2-master.zip/strong and unzipped it. It seems to contain source code files but no installation program. How am I supposed to use these files?  <answer226984> The build from source how-to is available at the git homepage of fuse-ext2. Please use the lines below though, because I had to make slight changes to get it working (e.g the libtool download source has been moved).  At least the appropriate xcode-command-line-tools and OSXFuse have to be installed.  Download the source from github and unzip the file. Then open Terminal.app and enter   precodecd ~/Downloads  /code/pre  assuming the fuse-ext2 file was unzipped there.  First you have to download, make and install several tools (m4, autoconf, automake, libtool, e2fsprogs). Then you can build fuse-ext2. This is all done using Terminal.app.  precodeexport PATH=/opt/gnu/bin:$PATH  mkdir gnu cd gnu  # m4 curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.17.tar.gz tar -zxvf m4-1.4.17.tar.gz  cd m4-1.4.17 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu make -j 16 sudo make install cd ../  # autoconf curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.69.tar.gz tar -zxvf autoconf-2.69.tar.gz  cd autoconf-2.69 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu make sudo make install cd ../  # automake curl -O http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/automake-1.15.tar.gz export PATH=/opt/gnu/bin:$PATH tar -zxvf automake-1.15.tar.gz  cd automake-1.15 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu make sudo make install cd ../  # libtool curl -O http://ftp.hawo.stw.uni-erlangen.de/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz tar -zxvf libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz  cd libtool-2.4.6 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu make sudo make install cd ../  # e2fsprogs curl -O https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tytso/e2fsprogs/v1.42.12/e2fsprogs-1.42.12.tar.gz tar -zxvf e2fsprogs-1.42.12.tar.gz cd e2fsprogs-1.42.12 ./configure --prefix=/opt/gnu make sudo make install sudo make install-libs cd ../../  # fuse-ext2 cd fuse-ext2-master export PATH=/opt/gnu/bin:$PATH ./autogen.sh CFLAGS="-idirafter/opt/gnu/include -idirafter/usr/local/include/osxfuse/" LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gnu/lib -L/usr/local/lib" ./configure make sudo make install /code/pre  All lines without a code#/code have to be entered in Terminal and then executed by hitting the kbdEnter/kbd key. You may use copy and paste.   hr  An easier way is to install brew and use these instructions below (also in Terminal).  precodebrew doctor #repair everything you are warned about! brew install homebrew/dupes/m4 brew install e2fsprogs automake autoconf libtool cd ~/Downloads/fuse-ext2-master ./autogen.sh CFLAGS="-idirafter/$(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/include -idirafter/usr/local/include/osxfuse" LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/lib" ./configure make  sudo make install /code/pre  hr  After finishing either of the two methods all necessary files are installed (including a prefpane) and you should be able to r/w ext2/3/4.  <answer265286> @klanomath:  I had some issues working through your instructions.  Brew failed for me so I went back and worked through the longer instructions.  There were a few issues I had to resolve, but couldn't have been successful without your outstanding instructions!  Thank you.  My notes:  The link is broken for libtool. Had to use:  precodecurl -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.4.6.tar.gz /code/pre  Also had issue with needing needing get text which addressed with:  precodebrew reinstall gettext /code/pre  and  precodebrew unlink gettext &amp;&amp; brew link gettext --force /code/pre  and Finally, I actually needed full Xcode install (so big) and then running the following command:  precodesudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer /code/pre  hr  I have compiled more code on a Mac than on Linux... didn't expect that... LOL  <comment275967> Thanks for the help... but it didn't work. Here's what I got in my terminal window:    make[3]: *** [install-exec-local] Error 1   make[2]: *** [install-am] Error 2   make[1]: *** [install-recursive] Error 1   make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1   Studio-Mac:fuse-ext2-master michel$ <comment275971> Studio-Mac:~ michel$ echo PATH$ PATH$ <comment275975> @MichelGougeon sorry that was the wrong one: `echo $PATH` is the right one <comment350195> I cannot expres how much I hate apple right now. I have to download a 2.6GB (xcode) program just to mount a filesystem and compile a driver myself? I'm on the brink of a nervous breakdown. <comment350197> @BdN3504 Command line tools (160 MB) are sufficient. AppleID required though.
