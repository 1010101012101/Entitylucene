Why don't my arrow keys work in vim under iTerm? <body> They work just fine if I use Terminal and start a vim session, but under iTerm I have to resort to using H-J-K-L to do left-up-down-right movement.  In both Terminal and iTerm TERM=xterm-color. My code.vimrc/code is quite lean and there are no key bindings set in there that would causing this problem.  iTerm v0.10.  <answer3372> Try the following:  ol liFrom the strongBookmarks/strong menu item, select strongManage Bookmarks.../strong./li liChoose the strongDefault/strong bookmark and click the edit icon./li liChange the strongKeyboard/strong setting to strongGlobal/strong./li /ol  <answer68762> The following worked for me.  In iTerm2:  ul liProfiles - Open Profiles.../li liEdit Profiles.../li liKeys tab/li liFrom Load Preset... drop-down, pick Terminal.app compatibility/li /ul  <answer138669> This is how I fixed:  precodennoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;^[A &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;^[B &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;^[D &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;^[C &lt;Nop&gt; /code/pre  strongNote:/strong   The strong"^["/strong characters must not be typed, instead you get them by doing: kbdâŒƒ/kbd-kbdV/kbd and pressing the corresponding cursor arrow position (up,down,left,right).   strongTested with: iTerm2 (Build 1.0.0.20140629)/strong  <answer287052> I was able to get this sorted out with iTerm2 Build 3.0.15 and the following excerpt from my .vimrc:  precode" Map alternate key combination for Esc. noremap &lt;c-[&gt; &lt;Esc&gt; " Map arrow keys for nomal mode. nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;&lt;Up&gt;A &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;&lt;Down&gt;B &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;&lt;Right&gt;C &lt;Nop&gt; nnoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;&lt;Left&gt;D &lt;Nop&gt; /code/pre  HTH.  <comment3060> That did the trick. Thanks. <comment11959> I got the same problem on iTerm2. There's no Bookmarks menu :( <comment12022> @Wei: They're called Profiles in iTerm2. Profiles - Open Profiles... and from there you can load the xterm defaults for Keyboard for the profile(s). <comment12044> @Ian, thanks. I found the settings but loading the xterm defaults didn't fix the problem. <comment68212> @WeiHu: The original suggestion from sentinel was to load the Global setting, not the xterm one, and I expect this carries over to iTerm2 - I'll try as soon as I install iTerm2. I know that Ian C. wrote xterm, but maybe that was a typo. <comment68488> For iTerm2, there's a FAQ section: http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/faq I use "Report Terminal Type: xterm-256color" together with the default xterm keybindings; you can try the ones from Terminal.app, but keybindings seem to be unrelated. For me the only important thing was to set Alt to behave as +Esc instead of Meta, but that shouldn't apply to arrows (for me, it fixed Alt-B and friends under screen). <comment163286> Sorry to post to this old thread, but I have just hit this problem, and I have tried all suggested fixes with zero improvement. 1) I have removed the plist preferences file and restarted itermbr 2) I have selected the Terminal.app compatibility in the keys section of the profile - again it did not help.br 3) Installed the latest stable and tested then the latest beta - no improvementbr 4) Works perfectly with the inbuilt Terminal application - no changes required Any pointers and help gratefully recieved as this is proving to be a real pain.
