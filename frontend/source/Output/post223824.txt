Shortcut for dragging and dropping a tab on terminal <body> Not sure if this is possible. But I was wondering if there is a shortcut for physically moving a tab on my Terminal.   Say I have these tabs on my terminal:   precode| tab A | tab B | tab C | tab D | /code/pre  If I were to move from tab A to tab C, I would do codecommand + ]/code or code[/code two times. Well, I'm very lazy, so I would like to just do codecommand + ]/code once. (This becomes especially useful when I have several tabs open) The only way to do that is to have tab C right next to A.   So, I'd like to have tabs in this order:   precode| tab A | tab C | tab B | tab D |  /code/pre  My question is, is there any way to get this done with a shortcut?  <answer262106> There is no such shortcut in emTerminal/em (apart of dragging the tabs manually), however such feature works fine out-of-box in emTerm2/em by hitting kbdShift/kbd-kbdCMD/kbd-kbd←/kbd/kbd→/kbd.  Another way is to have tabs in separate windows (kbdCMD/kbd-kbdN/kbd)and switch between them by kbdCMD/kbd-kbd1/kbd,kbd2/kbd,kbd3/kbd, etc in order you like.
