Will I receive all the SMS on my iPhone although it has been disconnected for some time? <body> After having my iPhone disconnected for some time, will all the text messages people have sent me, arrive to the phone once I reconnect it?  <answer136456> Usually SMS messages have a 'lifetime' of around 9 days - this is set by the carrier.  iMessages should be delivered the next time you connect your iPhone to a network.
