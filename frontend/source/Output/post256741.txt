Mouse not Functioning Properly in macOS Sierra <body> I have recently upgraded my 13" MacBook Pro to macOS Sierra, and I am now getting a very weird issue with the mouse.   Basically, I have two user accounts, and when I have to move my mouse to choose an account to log into, the mouse only moves up/down, it won't move left/right, very strange. Does anyone have an explanation for this?
