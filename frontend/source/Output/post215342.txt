OSX 802.1x/radius issues (yosemite/el captain) <body> I'm experiencing lots of headaches to get our 802.1x Wifi network back on working state on OSX machines.  The issue appeared after Yosemite upgrade and continued with El Captain; the only workaround was to use a PSK and not 802.1x/Radius.  strongThe problem:/strong OSX clients connect to the Wifi network, the association process takes way more time than usual, then it says 'connected'. But it's not. In fact, the IP sometime gets assigned, sometime not, but in both cases, traffic is not going through the wifi interface. It's not exchanging data.  strongThe possible culprit/strong: I think it's a problem related to certificates. I've stumbled across this KB from Apple (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203841) and followed it religiously (basically I've set 'Always Trust' on all certificates related to our Wifi network) but still does not work.  Even more confusing, is that on a single Macbook PRO it DOES work perfectly. I think the non-working macs have an invalid certificate somewhere and/or are missing one.  Is there a way to troubleshoot 802.1x and certificates problems on OSX ? Like a sort of logfile?  <comment341925> did you ever resolve this? This sounds like the problem I'm having. the apple doc you referenced no longer exists so I can't try that. <comment342123> Yes, in a way. It was my equipment. For some reason the manufacturer was not interested in keeping the product alive and stopped updating the firmware, thus making it incompatible with the latest security enhancement implemented in the networking stack of OSX. As soon as I replaced the old Trapeze system with Aerohive, the problem disappeared. <comment342124> BTW, you can access the old Apple's KB from the wayback machine ;)  https://web.archive.org/web/20150213040719/http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203841
