OS Sierra option to disable trackpad while wireless mouse is connected, overridden when waking from sleep <body> I have a 2015 MacBook Pro (CORE i7, 16 GB RAM, 13" Iris display) and an Apple Magic Mouse.  I selected the checkbox in Options-Accessibility-Trackpad and Mouse to ignore the trackpad while my wireless mouse is connected.  Ever since I upgraded to macOS Sierra, that option is ignored after waking from sleep, and must be reselected each time.  Is there a workaround I can use to make my selection stick, at least until this issue is patched by Apple?
