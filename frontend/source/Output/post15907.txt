Unsecured Call Message <body> I just installed iOS 5 and I constantly get this annoying message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2kFnl.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I turn it off?  <comment17287> It's possible that you're connected to an [IMSI catcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher). <comment17288> Bear in mind that iOS 5 is in beta, and this may simply be a symptom of its unfinished nature. <comment17298> You might get better answers at http://developer.apple.com/devforums/ where they have a place for pre-release, beta software support and discussions.
