Calendar notifications on Apple Watch <body> I'm facing issues with iOS Calendar notifications on Apple Watch.   I use Fantastical as my phone / watch calendar. I disabled the iOS Calendar notifications on my iPhone, and set the iOS Calendar watch notifications to mirror iPhone alerts.  Then, I deleted the iOS Calendar app.  The issue, is that I get two notifications every time, one from Fantastical (which is fine), and one from iOS Calendar app (which is wrong).  How can I prevent the iOS/watchOS Calendar app to notify me ever again?  ul liiPhone 7 (iOS 10.3.1)/li liApple Watch series 2 (watchOS 3.2)/li /ul  <answer281244> This seems to be a bug with Bridge.app (Apple Watch app on iOS) not syncing properly.  To force iOS sync all notification settings properly to your Apple Watch follow these steps.  emAs this takes some time, please try force reboot each device separately first.

(holding the digital crown and the side button on the Watch; holding the power button and the Home button/Touch ID on your iPhone (except for the iPhone 7 and newer) <comment353859> Yep, several times. <comment353860> How did you "delete the calendar app" and on which device? <comment353861> On iphone. Same way as you delete other apps. <comment353864> This just hides the stock Calendar.app within iOS. Please update your questions with your devices and the iOS/watchOS versions on your them. This may be helpful. I had a similar behavior with notification from another app. <comment353892> Points 8 and 9 are no needed. If I delete calendar.app after point 7 actually works.
