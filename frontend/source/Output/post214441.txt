Applescript: Automate Excel to convert .xls to .csv <body> I'm trying to batch process converting a folder of .xls files to .csv using Applescript for MS Excel V15.15. I'm using a sample I found online to model it :  precodeset theOutputPath to (path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "My Saved Workbook.csv"   tell application "Microsoft Excel"     tell active workbook       save workbook as filename theOutputPath file format CSV file format     end tell   end tell /code/pre  This is the script that fails consistently, though it seems to most closely resembles the model:  precodeset csv_folder to "Macintosh HD:Users:Me:CSV:" &amp; file_name as string     tell application "Microsoft Excel"         open Source_file         tell active workbook             save workbook as filename csv_folder file format CSV Mac file format--&gt;            (*This generates error "Microsoft Excel got an error: Parameter error." number -50 *)         end tell     end tell /code/pre  I have also tried:  precodeset csv_folder to "Macintosh HD:Users:Me:CSV:" &amp; file_name &amp; ".csv" as string  tell application "Microsoft Excel"     open Source_file         tell active workbook             save workbook as filename csv_folder --&gt;            (*This usually generates error "Microsoft Excel got an error:             Parameter error." number -50 the first time it is run,                then works the 2nd time *)         end tell end tell /code/pre  EDIT:emThis latter script, though it completes does not result in a true csv file, as when I open it with BBEdit it is showing code, not the file contents./em  I have also tried setting the cv_folder without using "as String". Any ideas why this fails? It does not seem to like the syntax "save workbook as filename theOutputPath file format CSV file format".   <answer215186> For strongExcel V15/strong, use a posix path, like this:  precodeset theOutputPath to POSIX path of ((path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "My Saved Workbook.csv") tell application "Microsoft Excel"     tell active workbook         save workbook as filename theOutputPath file format CSV Mac file format with overwrite     end tell end tell /code/pre  hr  strongEdit 1 -/strong  I test it on strongV15.15/strong and strongV15.16/strong, it's a bug when the destination folder doesn't contains a recently opened Excel file. So use it  precodeset theOutputPath to POSIX path of ((path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "My Saved Workbook.csv") set parentFolder to (do shell script "dirname " &amp; quoted form of theOutputPath) as POSIX file -- get the parent folder   tell application "Microsoft Excel"     alias parentFolder -- a folder where to save a new file, workaround to a bug when the destination folder doesn't contains a recently opened Excel file     save workbook as active workbook filename (theOutputPath) file format CSV Mac file format with overwrite end tell /code/pre  hr  strongEdit 2 -/strong  Or create an empty file like this  precodeset theOutputPath to POSIX path of (path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "My Saved Workbook.csv" do shell script "touch " &amp; quoted form of theOutputPath -- create an empty file set theOutputPath to theOutputPath as POSIX file tell application "Microsoft Excel"     save workbook as active workbook filename (theOutputPath) file format CSV Mac file format with overwrite end tell /code/pre  hr  strongEdit 3/strong : I had another idea, it would be the simplest script.  precodeset theOutputPath to (path to desktop folder as string) &amp; "My Saved Workbook.csv" tell application "Microsoft Excel"     alias theOutputPath --  workaround to a bug when the destination folder doesn't contains a recently opened Excel file     save workbook as active workbook filename theOutputPath file format CSV Mac file format with overwrite end tell /code/pre  <answer215396> It appears that the Parameter error is due to changes with Office 2016 for Mac.  http://preview.alturl.com/f8srb  From what I've learned from that thread Excel V15 can only write automatically (triggered by AppleScript) within the path ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.excel/. It looks like I will have to either revert to the previous version of Excel, or maybe write the files to that folder and then copy to the desired location. What a PITA.  <comment260022> Thanks for the help. The script you provided still returns the same parameter error for the line "save workbook as filename theOutputPath file format CSV Mac file format with overwrite". I'm beginning to believe this is a change in Excel For Mac v15 as none of the syntax for the Save as [File Type] options I've found work in Excel 15. <comment260181> I updated my answer. <comment260414> I'll try to test this later today. Thanks Jack!
