Text file preview failing in Finder (perhaps due to Sublime Text?) <body> I can no longer preview text files (e.g. code.txt/code) in Finder.   All I get is a preview pane showing a black square and TEXT.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qCZPj.png" alt="server1.txt failing to show me the contents in preview"  Other files such as code.tex/code files show a normal preview of the contents just fine. I think this changed after I installed Sublime Text, although I could be wrong.  I've tried installing codeqlstephen/code but this hasn't helped my problem.  Any suggestions much appreciated!  OS X El Capitan (10.11.6) MacBook Pro Retina.  <answer254779> I had the same problem, without Sublime and I used this instead: https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins  <comment317233> This still doesn't fix the issue. :-(
