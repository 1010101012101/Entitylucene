Tmux with iterm2 integration won't start when invoked with tmux -CC <body> I'm using iterm2 Build 1.0.0.20130302 and would like to get tmux working.  I followed the instructions at: https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration  Everything compiled and installed without incident.  When I run codetmux -CC/code I get the following:  precode** tmux mode started **  Command Menu ---------------------------- esc    Detach cleanly.   X    Force-quit tmux mode.   L    Toggle logging.   C    Run tmux command. Detached $ control set-client-size 80,25 -bash: control: command not found $ control set-value "affinities0=pty-8A4A5594-20D6-4AE2-A734-76075A248E63 pty-6CAAC2D6-70DB-44EF-9A14-7A50030731B4 0,pty-DD78FAE6-7E0A-49AE-BF49-67093639FEAB" -bash: control: command not found $ list-sessions -F "#{session_name}" -bash: list-sessions: command not found /code/pre  I'm not sure what to try next.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  <answer114500> I installed tmux as part of codehomebrew/code and it works just fine.  Once you have codehomebrew/code installed  codebrew install tmux/code will install tmux for you.
