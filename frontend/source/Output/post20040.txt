Anyone know a super easy .mp3 cutter? <body> I am looking for a super easy app for cutting .mp3 files, and setup fadeout at the end. Like Ringer, but this is for ringtones. plus the time is limited and I can't export mp3 files with it. But you get the idea. It's really easy to use.   Audacity, Garageband are way too complicated and big. Any tips?  <answer20045> You can trim it in iTunes, albeit not quite as graphically as other programs.   ol liClick to select the MP3 file in iTunes/li liFile → Get Info (or Cmd-I)/li li"Options" tab/li liChoose the Start Time and End Time -- you may need to test this out a few times/li liAdvanced → Create MP3/AAC version/li /ol  (For Step 5, whether it's MP3 or AAC depends on your import settings. This is under iTunes preferences → General → Import Settings.)  <answer20058> You should try QuickTime :  ol liOpen the file in QuickTime/li li⌘T (or the last item of the Edit menu, I don't know how it's called in English)/li liFrame the part you want with the yellow control/li liClick the yellow button/li liSave and you're done !/li /ol  Edit : In order to fade out, this software seems to be the solution (but I didn't try it myself).  <answer20096> Sound Studio is GREAT for lightweight, fast audio editing. I don't know if it is free, but it is definitely worth the money to buy it.br / Note: I am using Sound Studio 2.0.7 on Snow Leopard. I think the current version is 4.?.?, so I don't know what it's like now. And...yes it does fade out. Just select the section you want to fade out and click FiltersFade Out. Fast, lightweight and easy audio editing.  <answer20117> Audacity works well.  <answer20137> I know you said that strongAudacity/strong is too complex, and I agree that the interface is both overwhelming and difficult to figure out.  That said, trimming and fading out an audio file in the app is actually very straightforward and you get a lot of additional power that's still easy to use (see the bit I added on emnormalizing/em down at the end). Here's my walkthrough:  h3Open the File/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBvrZ.png" alt="Full File"  h3Select the Area to Keep/h3  Just drag the cursor across the waveform area. Press the spacebar to play/pause, or click the waveform at any spot and press the spacebar to play from there.  (Instead of selecting the "keep" area and trimming you can select the areas to remove and just hid the kbdDelete/kbd key.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yWtRP.png" alt="Selected Keep Area"  h3Select emTrim/em from the emEdit/em Menu/h3  Or press kbdCmd/kbdkbdT/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/goQXe.png" alt="Edit Menu -- Trim"  The trimmed file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZKex.png" alt="Trimmed"  h3Select the Area to Fade/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YasRc.png" alt="Faded Selection"  h3Select emFade/em from the emEffects/em Menu/h3  br /  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7XF3d.png" alt="Effect Menu -- Fade"  The now-faded result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pbe3e.png" alt="Faded Result"  h3Export as MP3/h3  br /  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OIVKh.png" alt="File Menu -- Export"  Choose mp3:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/inJzG.png" alt="Choose mp3 format"  Edit or enter file metadata:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L2gOB.png" alt="Edit Metadata"  strongDone!/strong  hr  h2Normalizing the Audio/h2  Because you're in a more powerful editing app, you could also take a moment to strongNormalize/strong the file. This brings the audio levels up to "full", meaning the file is as loud as it can be without clipping or distorting anything.   Normalizing is generally stronggreat/strong for podcasts and other spoken tracks, though isn't always recommended for music (sometimes the fact that it's quiet is intentional).  Here's how to normalize it while it's still open:  h3Select the Track/h3  kbdCmd/kbdkbdA/kbd for emSelect All/em is quick, or just double-click the waveform area.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xU27K.png" alt="Select the area to normalize"  h3Choose emNormalize/em from the emEffects/em Menu/h3  br /  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyzmL.png" alt="Effects Menu -- Normalize"  Use the default settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTqhb.png" alt="Normalize Options"  The resulting normalized audio:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qOFWx.png" alt="Normalized result"  <answer20392> Fission from Rogue Amoeba is a commercial program that can edit MP3s natively and is simple and easy to use. It costs US $39.  <comment22181> This is a great solution, i though this only works with videó files. But, i need the fade out feature at the end, so no luck with this, sadly:( <comment22183> Same as the previous answer, great, but i need the fade out feature. Thanks anyway! <comment22198> Sorry, I overlooked this aspect of your question. I think this software does what you seek (but I didn't try it myself) : http://www.deepniner.net/mp3trimmer/ <comment22203> Audacity doesn't have to be complicated.  It look intimidating because there's a lot it can do, but if you're just cutting and fading out, you can do that quickly and easily with Audacity.  Don't have to get fancy with it. <comment22206> Well, this one is ugly, but it does the job, thanks:) <comment22213> You're welcome :) <comment55295> Your answer, though it is a good answer, demonstrates just how complex Audacity is. :-) Too many pictures...waay too many pictures.
