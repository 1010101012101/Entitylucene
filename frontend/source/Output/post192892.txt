Opening links on Mac Chrome app in Incognito Mode <body> Is there a way to open a certain link with Chrome app Incognito Mode using the Terminal app on my Mac? (I want to input the link in the command as well).  <answer192898> To open a certain link with Google Chrome, use this command in terminal:  precode/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome 'http://example.com' --incognito /code/pre  Simply edit http://example.com to any other URL you want to use.  <comment229713> Does it work when the app is already launched ? I don't have an OSX next to me. <comment229718> @MatthieuRiegler Yes it does. With the default settings, it opens a new tab. <comment229727> I mean does it open a new window if you're not in incognito mode ? <comment229770> If you're not in Incognito Mode it will open a new window. <comment229815> Suprisingly it works unlike I thought, great !
