How can I listen to music using third party apps? <body> I'm looking for any well made (paid/unpaid) music player applications which will let me drag and drop music (MP3, FLAC) using Wifi to my iOS devices.   I know that applications like Xtreme Player and VLC media player do that for video clips. They can also handle music, but they handle music as an afterthought. What I mean is that they don't understand the concept of queueing music, playlists, etc.   Are there any applications which do this?   I already have an Apple Music subscription, but need to listen to some of the older stuff which I can't always find in their catalog.   Thanks for any suggestions!   <comment322816> What prevents you from using Music.app for your older stuff? <comment322828> I am partial to [VOX](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vox-music-player-soundcloud/id461369673?mt=12)  It's specifically for playing music and will sync up with your iTunes library as well.  Personally, I play through VOX but manage through iTunes.  It's also free <comment322834> This question is a good candidate for the [SE software recommendation site](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/).Â  I would recommend asking any software recommendation question there.
