Uninstalling freetds from OS X Mavericks <body> Does anyone know how to uninstall codefreetds/code from OS X? I have installed it from source by following instructions:  precodetar zxvf freetds-stable.tgz    cd freetds-'0.91'    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local    make   sudo make install  /code/pre  codegem install tiny_tds -- --with-freetds-include=/usr/local/include --with-freetds-lib=/usr/local/lib --with-iconv-include=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/include --with-iconv-lib=/usr/local/Cellar/libiconv/1.14/lib/code  My question is, what are the steps to uninstall this software?  <answer217133> The gem package is easy to reverse:  codegem uninstall tiny_td/code  You could run codegem cleanup/code to check for older versions of that package, but if you just installed it once and never updated, that isn't going to do anything further.  I've never used FreeTDS but if you're lucky this should undo what you've done : and go back to where you ran codemake install/code the first time then run codemake uninstall/code or codemake -n uninstall/code  If you're not lucky you'll have to do it manually (delete the files related to FreeTDS) which shouldn't be too hard, since you installed them all in to /usr/local - you could navigate there in Finder (command + G) and paste in that path).  <answer217829> I was able to successfully uninstall freetds and tiny_tds gem.  first I uninstalled tiny_tds gem as below:  precode gem uninstall tiny_tds /code/pre  To uninstall freetds follow the instructions to configure and build the freetds before running make uninstall.(otherwise it will give this error: make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'. Stop. )  precodecd freetds-'0.91'   ./configure --preifx=/usr/local    make sudo make uninstall sudo make clean /code/pre  You will have to remove freetds.conf file manually as below:  precodesudo rm /usr/local/etc/freetds.conf /code/pre  To ensure you have successfully uninstalled freetds run the following:  precodetsql -C /code/pre  It should not report freetds details.  <comment262464> I really appreciate your help on this. It uninstalled tiny_tds gem but not freetds. <comment262465> output of the following command still reports freetds version and other details as below: <comment262466> tsql â€“C  Compile-time settings (established with the "configure" script)                              Version: freetds v0.91               freetds.conf directory: /usr/local/etc       MS db-lib source compatibility: no          Sybase binary compatibility: no                        Thread safety: yes                        iconv library: yes                          TDS version: 5.0                                iODBC: no                             unixodbc: no                SSPI "trusted" logins: no                             Kerberos: no <comment262490> what does `make uninstall` output ? <comment263166> A gentle reminder - let's vote up hemal's question so that we all can take the discussion to chat :-) <comment263167> @maetosh, the output was : make: *** No rule to make target `uninstall'. Stop.
