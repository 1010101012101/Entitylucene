Is there any time limit in the List view of the iPhone Calendar app? <body> Is there any time limit in the List view of the iPhone Calendar app, beyond which we cannot make any entries? Can this limit be changed to something else than the 2 years set by by Apple?  <answer277985> There is no limit in the Calendar itself â€“ you can 'zoom out' by repeatedly tapping the Back button until you're in a screen where each year takes up about a single page. Scroll down to e.g. 2027, and you can create an event in the distant future without problems:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ub1JF.png" alt="enter image description here"   The List view emdoes/em seem to have a built-in limit of two years, which can't be extended by settings.  <comment349904> Thanks for response,,but latest two years entries only showing in agenda list and not beyond that...Is there a way to see more than 2 years entries in agenda list..Like 2027 entry you created.. <comment349929> Ah, you mean the List view. There seems to be no option to extend that period beyond two years. <comment349936> Yes List view and there is no way to view beyond 2 years.....No idea why this limitation they have put on list view.... <comment349956> In Google and blackberry phone there seems to be no such  limit..Why is it so with apple phone..Really frustrating it is...
