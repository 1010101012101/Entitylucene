Disabling the software escape button on touchbar <body> Is there any way to disable permanently the software Escape button on the Touch Bar. After two months I can't get used it, and can't help touching it inadvertently in the middle of some important operations.   Any solution other than drilling through the touchbar is welcome.   <answer277896> You can't remove it, it's permanent (unless viewing expanded touch bar view).  <comment369596> It's horrible â€“ I keep hitting it after months of getting used... <comment369599> See the full answer for this duplicate: BTT
