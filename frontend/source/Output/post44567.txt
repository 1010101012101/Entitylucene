How can I install getent on Snow Leopard? <body> I have several scripts which require the utility codegetent/code. In addition, I've read several handy tips which use getent.  codegetent/code is a Networking utility which is widely available on Unix, *BSD and Linux-based systems. This tool is commonly used by Sysadmins and power users to lookup network information (IP addresses, etc). As far as hostnames go, codegetent/code is one of the few tools which use both code/etc/hosts/code and DNS.  As Wikipedia says:     getent is a unix command that helps a user get entries in a number of   important text files called databases.   The important thing here is that codegetent/code will search the same name services in the same order as would most applications on a unix-like system. This makes it invaluable when debugging system or application trouble. Tools like codedig/code and codenslookup/code specifically look at DNS only, while codedscl/code expects you to spell out the name services you want to search.  I would like to use codegetent/code for two testcases:  ol liParse code/etc/hosts/code before querying DNS. For example, if I add codetesthost.example.org/code to code/etc/hosts/code, then codegetent hosts testhost.example.org/code should use the entry from code/etc/hosts/code before querying DNS./li liQuery LDAP using getent/li /ol  MacPorts does not seem to provide a package providing codegetent/code.  Does codegetent/code exist on Snow Leopard?  <answer44608> Have a look at How to emulate Unix’ getent with MacOSX’s dscl.  Since you have scripts that make use of codegetent/code, you may wish to pursue a script as a wrapper around dscl.  <answer85230> codedscacheutil/code is probably the best way to do this. It doesn't emulate the usual search process, it emuses/em it, so you'll actually get the same results as a standard lookup (including caching, /etc/hosts, computer records in directory services, DNS, mDNS for .local names, etc).  precode$ dscacheutil -q host -a name www.apple.com name: e3191.c.akamaiedge.net alias: www.apple.com www.isg-apple.com.akadns.net www.apple.com.edgekey.net  ip_address: 69.192.45.15  $ dscacheutil -q host -a name gordons-mbp.local name: gordons-mbp.local ipv6_address: fe80:5::e6ce:8fff:fe50:136  name: gordons-mbp.local ip_address: 192.168.10.249  $ dscacheutil -q host -a ip_address 127.0.0.1 name: localhost alias: 1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa  ip_address: 127.0.0.1  $ dscacheutil -q user -a name gordon name: gordon password: ******** uid: 501 gid: 20 dir: /Users/gordon shell: /bin/bash gecos: Gordon Davisson /code/pre  <comment50662> What is `getent`? What does it do? What systems is it typically available on? <comment50666> There's no 1:1 mapping for `getent` on OS X because OS X uses [DirectoryService](http://www.afp548.com/article.php?story=LeopardServerReview-LocalDirectory) to do resolution on things like hostnames. Can you give some specific `getent` use examples? It'd make showing you the corresponding way to get that information on OS X easier. <comment50667> @CajunLuke : `getent` is typically available on Unix, *BSD and Linux-like systems. I updated my question. <comment50687> So what is it you're trying to do with `getent`? Resolve host names from `/etc/hosts` before using DNS? <comment50854> My most common use case is to resolve hostnames from `/etc/hosts` before DNS, which is useful for Webserver and other network tests. But I (and other sysadmins) use getent for other things as well, such as troubleshooting LDAP.
