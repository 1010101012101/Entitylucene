Macbook Air running Windows w/two monitors <body> I am trying to run two monitors on my new MACBook Air using Windows 7. When I connect the second monitor the display defaults to the lowest resolution setting and will not change.  Also I can not run the monitors independently. Do I need to install different graphics? Right now the graphics driver is for a "Generic PnP Monitor on Standard VGA Graphics Adapter". Any suggestions?
