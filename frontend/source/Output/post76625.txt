How to add application built-in services (menu bar commands) in Automator? <body> I am wondering whether it is possible to use built-in services (menu bar options) of specific applications in Automator.  For instance, I want to create a service to launch Google Chrome and open a new window (the effect of kbdCommand/kbd+kbdN/kbd when Chrome is active).  Is it possible?  <answer76644> You can always use AppleScript for that. In Automator, drag emRun AppleScript/em to the right pane, and for the script, enter the following:  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     make new window     activate end tell /code/pre  The codeactivate/code is optional, but it'll bring Chrome to the front.  <comment88869> Using a service to start Chrome seems a bit strange. Can you elaborate a bit more on the problem you are trying to solve, maybe there are better solutions than creating an Automator workflow. <comment88955> Well, I don't think it's strange at all. The best thing about services is keyboard shortcuts. Beyond that, sometimes I need to keep a Chrome window open in full screen presentation mode and perform tasks in new windows. It's not cool to Command Tab to switch into a Chrome full screen window, Command N to launches a new full screen window, and Command Control F to exit full screen mode. <comment88956> Cool, it works. Thank you very much! Guess I really need to spend some time on applescripts. I've always been lazy about that. <comment88975> Glad to help! AppleScript can be hard to learn since it's a little different to get things done if you know other programming languages, but it's fun after a while.
