Why does my CPU usage drop significantly? <body> I have been investigating slowdown in a high CPU process I run periodically, suspecting that it is CPU throttling related.  After installing Intel's CPU monitoring utility I seem to have confirmed this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j7RXt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice the massive drop off, from nearly 3 GHz to ~1Ghz and even less at times. This drop 100% correlates to my performance hit in the application I am running. It sits at this low speed indefinitely until I stop the high-CPU process.  I am trying to understand what is happening to cause such a massive performance dropoff. The temperature peaks around 65C (and stays around 63C when throttled lowest).  When this happens, I have nearly no processes using CPU - the game taking CPU is ~100% and everything else not-relevant. Activity monitor shows ~80% cpu idle.  I do not understand what is happening or how to control this. My understanding is the temperature range which is "ok" should be considerably above the low 60s for processor temperature, but it seems this is entirely prevented by some  OSX process.  I have looked around the settings but cannot seem to find anything.  I have reset my SMC and this confirms my CPU can sustain ~80C temperatures (seen in the initial stages of my CPU intense process) but then, the speed/temperature plummet again.  How can I fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qs5N2.png" alt="enter image description here"
