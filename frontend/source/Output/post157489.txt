Play Safari web videos in full-screen on second monitor while using first monitor <body> I have two monitors and am using OS X Mavericks. In Safari when viewing a YouTube streaming video full screen on one monitor, if I use the other monitor it causes the YouTube video to switch from full screen. I have been able to get full screen to work while using the other monitor a couple of times, but I do not know how I did it. It would be nice to get it to work consistently.
