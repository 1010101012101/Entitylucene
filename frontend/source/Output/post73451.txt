Skydrive reports errors synchronizing files shared with VirtualBox <body> I'm getting the following errors when synchronizing my Skydrive   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qoN7h.png" alt="enter image description here"  I believe the issue is that I save my Windows 7 based Virtual Box files on the Mac.  See below how I share files between the guest OS and MacOS.  I'm configured this way so I have documents, mp3s, and videos available to every VM and the host MacOS... without any duplication or version conflicts.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R9Jpi.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I address the errors that Skydrive is giving me?  <comment85336> Interesting - the OS X error dialog seems to indicate that you are syncing from OS X to skydrive - is that a correct assumption? <comment85339> Yes I'm syncing from OSX to skydrive.  All files that I care about synching are on OSX.  (rationale was "why run skydrive on Windows Guest OS AND MacOS when I can just work from one copy of the data) <comment85347> The reason to run the skydrive on Microsoft side is virtual box handles the filesystem differences and you get the native MS sync between Windows OS and Windows Cloud. I would expect MS to fix their PC client to handle the differences in path separator since that's a common problem when exposing the raw filesystem to both OS.
