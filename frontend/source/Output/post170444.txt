How to have new email notification while Apple Mail.app is closed? <body> In OS X when Calendar.app is closed I get notifications about events; how can I have this work in Mail.app? While Mail is closed I want to get new email notifications.  <answer170454> You cannot.   You need the Mail app running. Unlike Calendar events, checking for emails is not something that can run locally. A client application need to connect with your mail server and retrieve your e-mails.   Sure there could be some background process that does that without the need of the Mail app, but it would not make much sense; in the end you would still have a process doing the checking.   hr  Something that may make the Mail app less intrusive to you desktops' organization etc is having it been launched automatically strongand/strong hidden at startup.  <comment271714> This is a useful answer in that it tells *how things actually work* in OS X, but I'm not seeing much logic to the claims that it *ought* to work that way.  The UI need not be available for the mail to be fetched.  Think of Messages â€”it's the same in principle.  There's no reason (that you've given or that is self-evident) why Apple couldn't or shouldn't have built it to work when Mail.app is closed, it's just the case that for whatever reason *they didn't* build it that way. <comment271786> `The UI need not be available for the mail to be fetched` sure, but by having an app "closed" we mean "not running", i.e. quit. I guess Messages app is something that has a more "real time" notion, that's why it doesn't require the app running. Sure, I gave no actual reason with 100% certainty because I am not Apple and it wasn't me who made that choice :) <comment271787> Messages and many other apps simply have a lightweight background app that handles fetching data and displaying notifications, and then a larger visible app that the user can interact with.  This actually makes a lot of sense in many cases and I'm not sure why they wouldn't do this with mail. <comment271801> Probably nobody can answer that with certainty... Imo, messages and calendar events are more important than emails and you probably never want to shut them down completely. <comment272078> What the heck apple -_-, being a mail client I expected some way of being notified even when I close the app .. sad :(   , can you suggest some third party mail app that can do this ? <comment272079> I would suggest closing the UI (hit the 'x' window button) and keep it running
