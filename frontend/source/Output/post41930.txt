How can I use a Wii remote as a remote control for Keynote on my mid-2011 MacBook Air? <body> I have a Wii Remote and a mid-2011 MacBook Air. What do I do to pair the Wii remote with the Air, and what software can accept input from this Bluetooth device and send it to Keynote?  I'm looking for much more than a link to a piece of software. What software do you use, how do you go about setting up the pairing, and how do you go about using the Wii remote?  <answer41938> I believe that you'll need to download Darwiin Remote form here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwiin-remote/. This software will allow communication between the Wii Remote and your computer.  I haven't played with this for a long time, but I believe that when I did this app allows the Wii Remote to act as your mouse and provide direct interaction with the system (I used a candle to provide the required infrared source for tracking).  <answer41942> Remote Buddy supports using a Wii remote to control a Mac and lists Keynote as a controllable application. You can also customise button-presses to perform a range of different actions. Although I've never tried it with a Wii remote, I do use it with an Apple remote to control a Mac Mini as a media centre and its a great piece of software.   The iospirit FAQ's contain information on setting up and pairing the Wii remote. Once paired you should be able to use the Mapping tab to assign functions to the buttons, or pick from a standard set of modifiable 'behaviours'.  <comment47566> Flick Wii-mote to advance slide? Yes please! <comment47592> Indeed, I do have the software downloaded, but have not been able to successfully sync my Wii remote, let alone use it. What do you do? <comment47614> Press 1 button and 2 button simultaneously, or use the red button inside the wiimote battery compartment instead of buttons 1 and 2.
