How to specify group id for a user-defined group <body> When I set up my accounts in Snow Leopard Server, I was able to give an explicit group id to my user-defined groups using the old Workgroup Manager. Now that I've updated to Mountain Lion Server, I miss that precise control.  Here is my problem: I created the following groups and group ids in OS X 10.6 Server  precode 1025 - myteam  1026 - workgroup  1027 - theAteam  9000 - zombiesquad  9001 - hoboes /code/pre  When I migrated to OS X 10.8 with the new Server app, my groups and group ids have all been scrambled:  precode 1025 - workgroup  1026 - myteam  1027 - theAteam  1028 - zombiesquad  1029 - hoboes /code/pre  How do I go about setting the groups and group ids back to their prior assignment?  <answer92050> You can still use Workgroup Manager on Mountain Lion.  You just have to download it and install it.  You can also do it using command line tools, but since you're used to Workgroup Manager, just use that.  <comment108043> Thanks for the tip about downloading Workgroup Manager for 10.8.  I'd actually like to learn how to fix it on the command line, because I suspect that this is going to be a re-occurring problem, and I'd rather use the Terminal and command line to take care of it. It's also easier for us to document using the command line. <comment108048> @walrus I don't know about that.  On Linux systems the command line is easy, but Mountain Lion uses Open Directory and it's more complicated than I've ever wanted to wade into.  But you can try 'man dscl' from the command line to get documentation.
