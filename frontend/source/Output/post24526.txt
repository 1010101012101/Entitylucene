How can I convert a .mov into a .gif (or a .apng)? <body> I want to put a .mov file I have as the background for a website. I am guessing the best way to do this would be to convert it to a .gif file but I can't find any programs that do it.   I have tried Handbrake, Graphic Converter and Gif Builder.   <answer24535> Gif Ninja is a great site for converting videos to gifs. I've used it several times and the gif always comes out great.  <answer46560> I've used www.online-convert.com to convert Keynote-exported .mov files in to animated gifs. Quick and simple. And the results were good.  You can see the resulting GIF in the answer I gave to this question: How to partially uncover bullet points in Keynote  <answer183302> I've used "jiffy cat" with great results.  http://gfycat.com/  <answer211219> For strongTerminal/strong lover  precodeffmpeg -i in.mov -s 600x400 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 10 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3 &gt; out.gif /code/pre  ul licode-r 10/code tells ffmpeg to reduce the frame rate from 25 fps to 10/li licode-s 600x400/code tells ffmpeg the max-width and max-height/li licode--delay=3/code tells gifsicle to delay 30ms between each gif/li licode--optimize=3/code requests that gifsicle use the slowest/most file-size optimization/li /ul  You need to install  ul listrongffmpeg/strong to process the video file/li listronggifsicle/strong to create and optimize the an animated gif/li /ul  hr  precodebrew install ffmpeg   #if cask is not installed brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask  #dependency for gifsicle, only required for mountain-lion and above brew cask install xquartz  brew install gifsicle /code/pre  Above instructions taken from gist: strongdergachev/GIF-Screencast-OSX.md/strong  The following error occurred while installing the codeffmpeg/code     Error: The codebrew link/code step did not complete successfully   The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local   Could not symlink include/libyasm   /usr/local/include is not writable.

Pretty simple app.  <comment27522> A .mov file is a movie, do you want to have a movie as the background or just a specific frame/picture from the movie? <comment27592> I want the movie, like an animated background. It's not a particularly active clip, it's just a face going in and out of focus with a lot of white space around it which I'm planning to put the site's content in. <comment27594> Hm, just tried Gif Ninja and the gif outputted is very low resolution, probably less than 120px...   Is there anyway to do this at a much better quality?  Thanks very much <comment27614> @sanja And you're sure that the video you have is good resolution (just making sure)? I will continue to look around. <comment27691> Yeap. I'm not sure how to check exact resolution but I'd say it's HD. It certainly looks like it is when it's fullscreen. <comment27707> Do Command-I. Somewhere in the info box should be the dimensions. What format is it in? <comment27741> 960X450 It's a .mov file. <comment30540> Generally speaking, an animated GIF file is *much larger* than a MOV file with the same quality. <comment197977> gifninja.com seems dead :( <comment210686> https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207 <comment262320> If you get the `brew link` error, you should also `brew link --overwrite ffmpeg` after `chown`ing to fix permissions on `/usr/local`. <comment262324> This is a very handy answer, but I found that gifsicle created pretty horribly compressed frames; the output of movie (game screencap) looked like crap.  There are other options here, including using ImageMagick instead of gifsicle: https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207 <comment262386> Yes I too run this but the output was not upto the marks, resolution was not good. <comment279356> gfycat doesn't actually convert the file to GIF anymore -- at least I couldn't find a way to do that <comment280228> couldn't manage to get it working :( (no output file generated ) <comment293037> Works like a charm, free and they don't collect your email address
