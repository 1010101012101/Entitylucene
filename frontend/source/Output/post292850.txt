How to prevent encrypted (CoreStorage) partition on external USB drive from mounting when connecting it? <body> I wish this question would be a duplicate to Can you make OSX mount just certain partitions when you connect an external HDD?   I've made two partitions to an external USB drive. The first partition is unencrypted and the second one is encrypted. I'd like to have the encrypted partition only to be mounted at will. Currently it asks for password every time I connect the drive and I have to skip it manually.  I'm comfortable using codesudo vifs/code to edit the code/etc/fstab/code file, but I'm unsure what parameters I should input.   This is what codediskutil list/code lists for the device when I've connected the drive and skipped the password:  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *8.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS UNENCRYPTED             2.9 TB     disk2s2    3:          Apple_CoreStorage ENCRYPTED               5.1 TB     disk2s3    4:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s4  Offline                                  Logical Volume ENCRYPTED on disk2s3                                  9A8CE4BE-CFD1-47FE-B9EC-213E1B4CAA83                                  Locked Encrypted /code/pre  The 9A8CE4BE-… is apparently the CoreStorage UUID. These UUIDs are also related:  precode$ diskutil info /dev/disk2s3 | grep UUID    Disk / Partition UUID:    D08CDA9C-4692-4D3E-A180-70E0E891D580    PV UUID:                  36FFBDBF-7426-416C-93BC-3BF427A834DC    LVG UUID:                 C8E53622-36F1-4625-ABAC-84EB0A9728A0 /code/pre  Can the mount-prevention be done à la linked question? I tried the accepted answer's line with all aforementioned 4 UUIDs and codeLABEL=ENCRYPTED/code, but no use. Granted, accepted answer's fstab-line has codehfs/code—should it be something else for cs-encrypted partitions?  Note: I did not reboot nor logout between the tries, but took the drive offline (power off). If someone knows the correct spell to prevent the encrypted drive from mounting, I'm of course happy to reboot.  <comment369979> Decided to use an encrypted image instead of a partition, as the performance hit in my use-case is negligible. Question still stands and answer might be useful in the future!
