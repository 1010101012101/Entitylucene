No bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key <body> When I boot my Macbook Pro 13" Retina (running newest Mavericks), it is showing me this error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/idw0z.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  However! If I boot holding the kbd⌥ alt/kbd-key, it shows Mavericks as option. When I  press kbd⌤ enter/kbd-key to confirm, it will boot normally. (I'm using this Macbook now to type this question).  Why won't my Macbook boot anymore? I did not use disk utility or something. What can cause this issue?  <answer134895> Boot normally then open strongSystem Preferences.app/strong  strongStartup Disk/strong. Select your drive and reboot. This should bless the drive and make it the default when powering on.  <answer212415> Better than that. I today tried this manipulation when I got the same error message : on startup keep pressing COMMAND + ALT + P + R to reset the NVRAM of your mac. Let the system restart 2 or 3 times (you know with the famous "Bammm" Mac sound). This should sort things out :)   <answer212503> Boot whilst holding ⌥ to open the boot selector, then instead of just pressing Enter on the Mavericks partition, hold ⌃ (control) as you press Enter and the ↑ arrow should change into a circular arrow indicating that this will be the default partition.  <comment159832> Do you run Windows on the Machine ?. Try following : Startup by pressing the X key, to force Mac OS X startup, or Startup by pressing the keys cmd-alt-shift-delete, so the system will boot to the Macintosh HD. <comment159834> No, I don't have installed bootcamp or Windows. <comment168391> OP, if you feel this answered your question, please accept it by clicking the checkmark on the left.
