Create Dock Icon for Spyder (installed with Anaconda) <body> How can I create a single dock icon for an application that is launched via the Terminal?   I have installed spyder using anaconda. I can create a launcher app using Platypus (see this answer). But the actual spyder-application opens a new (ugly) dock icon labeled "python" next to it: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AAYtP.png" alt="dock icons"  The confusion starts when I want to switch to the Spyder app: I have to click on the python icon and not on the spyder one...  <answer257969> This question is more of a programming question than a usability question, however it would probably have to be done programmatically as macOS normally looks for the icon inside the Application as part of a .plist file, and your application doesn't have this presumably because it's being run from command line as a script.  Have a look at: Changing Cocoa app icon, title and menu labels at runtime  <answer257998> Platypus is not necessarily needed to add an icon to spyder:  Starting spyder in the CLI is a two stage process:  ~/anaconda/bin/spyder is a shell script executing the "proxy app" ~/anaconda/bin/python.app which itself launches another "proxy app" ~/anaconda/python.app/Contents/MacOS/python including an argument.  hr  Since the last shell script resides in an app bundle you can simply add an icon:  The two proxy apps are "wrappers/launchers" for all other python science apps included in Anaconda. You don't want to break Anaconda - therefore you have to create two "spyder-only" launchers.  Make a copy of ~/anaconda/bin/python.app: ~/anaconda/bin/python.spyder.app and change the shell script inside (don't forget to also change the user in the path!).   precode#!/bin/bash export PYTHONEXECUTABLE=/Users/user/anaconda/bin/python /Users/user/anaconda/python.spyder.app/Contents/MacOS/python "$@" /code/pre  Then create a copy of ~/anaconda/python.app: ~/anaconda/python.spyder.app and add an icon to it.  Started from the Terminal the command codespyder/code will launch python.spyder.app with the custom icon.  Now you may use Platypus to create an app to launch codespyder/code (instead of using Terminal.app). Use the following settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qGpA6.png" alt="Platypus spyder"  This may break after an Anaconda or a spyder update.  hr  I don't think you can run spyder with a single spyder dock icon (with the Platypus spyder launcher as a permanent Dock item) because the python.spyder.app/python.app itself is a wrapper for spyder again. So after hitting the Platypus spyder app icon in the Dock you will always get a second spyder icon - the reason why your solution shows the default python.app icon.
