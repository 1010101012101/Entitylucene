Failed installing Nautilus Mac OSX <body> Hy all, I was tring to install Nautilus on my Macbook Pro 13", after installing MacPorts. But when it have to install the last dependency (gtk-doc source-highlight libexif), it give me this error:  precode---&gt;  Building source-highlight Error: org.macports.build for port source-highlight returned: command execution failed Error: Failed to install source-highlight Please see the log file for port source-highlight for details:     /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_textproc_source-highlight/source-highlight/main.log Error: The following dependencies were not installed: gtk-doc source-highlight libexif To report a bug, follow the instructions in the guide:     http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets Error: Processing of port nautilus failed /code/pre  Any one does have this problem too? How can I resolve it? I've already tryed to download and install all the Gtk-doc package, but it was the same... I'll attach the main.log file. Thanks for the help.  Here's the main.log file https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0AkZG79UCGuRllyaHAyVzFnT1k  <comment316636> A couple things:  1) Your best bet is to check with the *maintainer* of the port as they would know best and 2) make sure you are using the right libraries as I saw the error message "Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64" in your log several times. <comment316639> How do I do this? @Allan <comment316642> I suggest that you read the guide- https://guide.macports.org/ and follow the instructions under 3.1.12 port clean. If the build fails again then submit a ticket. <comment316643> Ok thank you! @fd0 <comment316644> It give me the same error... :( @fd0 <comment316645> Save the build log and file a ticket with the build log.
