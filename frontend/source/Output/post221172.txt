Can't delete Logical Volume Group on Fusion drive <body> I have a 2014 iMac Retina running OS X Yosemite and a 3TB Fusion drive. I am attempting to restore it from a Time Machine backup, but when I try to do so, I get the error message, "The disk can't be erased." referring to the Macintosh HD Fusion drive. Trying to use disk utility to delete the drive also doesn't work.  I had previously had this problem when I had to restore my computer, and managed to use the solution found here using Terminal to manually delete the Logical Volume Group. However, now when I use the command:  precodediskutil cs deleteLVG UUID /code/pre  The process begins and says "Destroying Logical Volume Group" but it only gets to 20% and then nothing happens. Even after letting it sit for hours it shows no further progress.  I also found this solution here, which recommends using the command  precodediskutil cs deleteVolume UUID /code/pre  to delete the Logical Volume first, prior to deleting the Logical Volume Group, but when I do so I get the following message:     Error: -69779: Unable to delete the CoreStorage Logical Volume   So at this point I'm stuck. If anyone has any other suggestions for how I can delete the Fusion drive and restore from my Time Machine backup, I would appreciate any help. Thanks.  <answer222685> If all other means fail to remove a CoreStorage Volume Group you can always use codegpt/code to remove the CS partition (or the CS partitions if it is a Fusion Drive).  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liDetach your backup drive/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).

Also, it seems like the partitions on my Fusion drive were a mess, so I wiped all of them away (except 2 in the front and 2 at the end), and created a new partition.    Once I did that, I was able to go to the Graphical Interface of Disk Utility and create the Volumes, and it was pretty simple from there.
