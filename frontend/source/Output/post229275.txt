Problem with kextunload SD card remount <body> So I got one of those SD card flush mounts, but it occasionally self ejects. I'm trying to solve that via kextunload given on this page  Entering:  precodesudo kextunload -b /System/Library/Extensions/AppleSDXC.kext /code/pre  Returns:  precode(kernel) Kext /System/Library/Extensions/AppleSDXC.kext not found for unload request. Failed to unload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleSDXC.kext - (libkern/kext) not found. /code/pre
