iCal won't change what calendar events are saved on <body> My usual issue goes something like this:  ul liClick to add new event, under the default calendar/li liAdd details, etc, and save/li /ul  Later on, when I want to move it to a different calendar, I edit it, and change it to a different one via the drop-down.  ul liMake edit, click done/li liThe event will change to the proper calendar/li liThe event disappears/li liThe event reappears under the original (default calendar)/li /ul  All the calendars are on Google Calendars, and synced via CalDAV into iCal as delegates. I've never had an issue up until a few months ago, and now I have to sign into Google each time I want to move an event.  Running OSX 10.7.5, iCal 5.0.3  Any suggestions?  <answer95097> I've had similar trouble. I just went to preferencesaccounts and unchecked, then re-checked "enable" for the account. Seems to be working for now.
