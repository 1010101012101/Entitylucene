Adobe Flash Player installation failed <body> h3Background/h3  When the Adobe Flash player update was auto-updated, I had to quit Safari and then continue the installation.  Accidentally, I started Safari again right during the installation procedure.  This resulted in a never-ending install that I had to force-quit.  So, I downloaded the Uninstall Flash Player software to completely remove flash from my system and then re-install it.  h3Problem/h3  The (new) install failes with the folloing error report: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AErxj.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I install flash now? How can this error occur even though Flash was apparently completely removed from the system?   <answer41375> A restart fixed the problem. The installation worked without interruptions.  <comment46748> Do you mean "How can I install Flash now" instead of "How can I install Safari now"? <comment46749> Also, have you tried searching Spotlight for "flash" or "adobe" in case the uninstaller didn't take care of everything? <comment46750> @bneely Thanks for the hint. Of course, I meant to ask "How can I install Flash now?". Searching in spotlight only shows some `font-adobe-blablabla` subdirectories which belong to macports. Then I've searched `~/Library` for flash and removed `com.adobe.blabla` folders and the Adobe Application support. <comment46751> I've also searched `/Library` for 'flash' and 'adobe' without significant results.
