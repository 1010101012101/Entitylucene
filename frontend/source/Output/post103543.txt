Disable Repeated System Alerts in iOS 7 <body> On iOS 7, there is a feature under codeCellular/code in Settings called: codeUse Cellular Data For:/code. This lists all of the apps I have on my iPhone 4 with individual On/Off Switches to disable or enable cellular data. So, I disable it on several of my apps, one of which being strongMusic/strong. When I open my Music app, it tells me…     strongCellular Data is Turned Off for "Music"/strongbr   You can turn on cellular data for this app in Settings.   This alert does not occur once, but strongevery time/strong I clear the Music app from my multitasking and re-open it. Is there a way to dismiss this alert once and forever?  The alert looks something like this, but for Music:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2KeY.png" width="300"  <answer115535> This can't be done at the moment. There's no option to disable the alert, other than enabling cellular data.  If you're jailbroken, you can install strongNoAnnoyance/strong:     h1subsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtOqe.png" width="35"/sub/sub NoAnnoyance/h1      h3Tame iOS annoying alerts!/h3      strongA CydiaSubstrate tweak to disable annoying iOS 7 messages./strong      Supported alerts:      ul   liCellular data is not enabled/li   liDisable airplane mode to access data/li   liTurn Off Airplane Mode or Use Wi-Fi to Access Data/li   liLocation accuracy improved by enabling Wi-Fi/li   liUnsupported charging accessory/li   liAccessory unreliable/li   liLow battery/li   liCellular data is turned off for "AppName" disabled/li   liLow disk space/li   liThe mail server is not responding/li   liMore.../li   /ul   If you wish for a non-jailbreak solution, you can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html/li /ul  hr  Possible solution provided by Parasprite — I can't get it to work:     After some trial and error, it seems as if it becomes permanent after a few tries.      ol   liTurn cellular data off for the offending app ([Music])./li   liOpen [Music], dismiss warning./li   liClose app using the app switcher (double-click home button and swipe off of screen)./li   liRe-open [Music], dismiss popup./li   liGoto step 3, repeat until it stops showing./li   /ol      If it's behaviour is anything like The Game Center popup, it should be permanent after 3 dismissals.    <answer122726> If the popup only occurs after you clear Music from your multitasking, you could simply avoid doing that.   I know I can't convince inveterate app quitters, but the multitasking on iOS really does all the handling of RAM just fine.   <comment143281> Thank you for your edit. Jailbreaking seems to be the only available solution as of now. <comment149324> While this would help users with an iPhone 5 or 5S (even a 4S), my iPhone 4 becomes slow after 5 or more applications in multitasking, which means this would not be my first answer choice. Thank you for your answer. <comment168794> Are there any updates on this question? I don't want to Jailbreak my iphone but I can't stand these messages! <comment168795> @user4050 AFAIK nothing's changed and nothing appears to have changed in the iOS 8 betas regarding this <comment185620> I just used [Pangu](http://en.pangu.io) to jailbreak my iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1. Worked perfectly, and I was able to install NoAnnoyance by following the instructions at the bottom of the [NoAnnoyance documentation](https://github.com/pNre/NoAnnoyance). A year of these annoying alerts turned me from someone who thought it was foolish to jailbreak into an enthusiastic jailbreaker. <comment218103> I don't clear the apps, and I do get the messages.  Every. Darn. Time. <comment218105> See also the huge thread at the official Apple forums https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5433258 <comment220989> For those unfamiliar with app switcher, you swipe the item upwards to remove it. Solution # 2 seems to be working for the moment, +1.
