How can I export my iPhone notes to text files, preserving the modification date? <body> I have hundreds of notes on my iPhone. I want to export these to a different program that can import text files. I'm trying to preserve the modification date (e.g. by storing it in the file's modification date, or by including the date in the file somewhere). If there's any way to preserve the creation date (if it's even stored), that's desired too.  Is there any way to do this? I have both a Mac and PC.  <answer1768> iTunes can setup notes sync with MS Outlook or OS X Mail(osX 10.5.8). This can be setup under the info tab for your device in iTunes, and sync will take place when the device is plugged into the computer by the USB cable.  Once in Outlook, you can save notes as text files. The notes have creation and modifcation date attached. Saving as text will strip some of that information.  <answer1769> In OSX, they're automatically synced to the Mail program. There is a section on the left side of the screen that says "Notes." If you like, I can post screenshots later (not at my MacBook right now).  Here's a way to sync them with a Google account. This is pretty cool, and probably the best way to sync between multiple computers/ devices. Check it out. If you don't have a Google account, might be worth it now lol.  Hope this helps!  <comment1550> I regularly create notes when I'm working at my computer. It's a lot faster than typing them into the iTouch screen. <comment66868> http://tomscoding.tumblr.com/post/28190447430/import-old-notes-from-iphone-into-mac-mountain-lion <comment138457> Unfortunately this isn't the case anymore with OS X 10.9 and iOS 7, seems like they've orphaned the Notes left On My iPhone.
