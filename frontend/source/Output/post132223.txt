autossh not forwarding, regular ssh tunnel does <body> Starting autossh like so: codeautossh -M 5122 -N -R 5432:localhost:5432 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;myhost&gt;/code, I can't connect to localhost:5432. If I run codessh -f &lt;user&gt;@&lt;myhost&gt; -L 5432:localhost:5432 -N -v -v/code, I can.  The output from autossh:  precodedebug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:5122 forwarded to remote address 127.0.0.1:5122 debug1: Local forwarding listening on ::1 port 5122. debug2: fd 6 setting O_NONBLOCK debug1: channel 0: new [port listener] debug1: Local forwarding listening on 127.0.0.1 port 5122. debug2: fd 7 setting O_NONBLOCK debug1: channel 1: new [port listener] debug1: Remote connections from LOCALHOST:5122 forwarded to local address 127.0.0.1:5123 debug1: Remote connections from LOCALHOST:5432 forwarded to local address localhost:5432 debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com debug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: remote forward success for: listen 5122, connect 127.0.0.1:5123 debug1: remote forward success for: listen 5432, connect localhost:5432 debug1: All remote forwarding requests processed /code/pre  And from ssh:  precodedebug1: Local connections to LOCALHOST:5432 forwarded to remote address localhost:5432 debug1: Local forwarding listening on ::1 port 5432. debug2: fd 6 setting O_NONBLOCK debug1: channel 0: new [port listener] debug1: Local forwarding listening on 127.0.0.1 port 5432. debug2: fd 7 setting O_NONBLOCK debug1: channel 1: new [port listener] debug1: Requesting no-more-sessions@openssh.com debug1: forking to background debug1: Entering interactive session. /code/pre  I've just recently started playing around with ssh tunneling and cannot figure out why autossh will only forward port 5122.  <answer176219> A bit late to answer, but maybe it still helps someone.  I had the same problem, turns out you need to use -L instead of -R:  precodeautossh -M 5122 -L 5432:localhost:5432 &lt;user&gt;@&lt;myhost&gt; /code/pre
