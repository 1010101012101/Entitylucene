Linux: libimobiledevice don't detecting device in recovery mode <body> Today I compiled libimobiledevice on my PC with kali linux, but if I want to do anything with device in recovery mode, usbmuxd don't detect it. In normal mode work all fine. I tried reinstalling usbmuxd and recompiling other libs but not succeeds.  Only one app work fine in recovery mode: irecovery.  There are outputs from libimobiledevice apps:  irecovery:   precodeAttempting to connect...  opening device 05ac:1281...
