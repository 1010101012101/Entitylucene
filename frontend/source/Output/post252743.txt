How can I remove DisplayPort from audio devices? <body> When I connect my external monitor it shows up in the audio settings. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XRc7B.png" alt="enter image description here"  That makes zero sense, as this monitor does not have any speakers.  How can I prevent it from popping up as an audio output option?  <comment314481> It makes perfect sense. The U2713HM has an audio output which it is reporting to the computer, therefore it shows up as an output device. <comment314571> Though, interestingly, I have a U2713HM & a U2713H both connected via DisplayPort & neither show up in Sound.
