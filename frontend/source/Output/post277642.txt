Permission denied with .pm files <body> I'm getting a lot of errors while trying to install software with Homebrew.  All of them are similar to the following:  precodeCan't locate Getopt/Long.pm:   Permission denied at /usr/bin/pod2man5.18 line 19. BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /usr/bin/pod2man5.18 line 19. /code/pre  Seems to be a permission problem, but I can't figure out how to fix it.  Any idea?  EDIT:   Command codecd /usr/bin/ &amp;&amp; ls -l | grep pod2man/code prints:  precode-rwxr-xr-x  38 root   wheel   811B Jul 31  2016 pod2man* -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel    11K Jul 31  2016 pod2man5.16* -rwxr-xr-x   1 root   wheel    13K Jul 31  2016 pod2man5.18* /code/pre  <comment349405> maybe csrutil is the cause of this problem <comment349454> How? I'm not messing with kernel extensions, just installed software. <comment349461> Hmm, exactly how did you install Homebrew? Did you use [the exact command from their webpage](https://brew.sh/index_nl.html) or did you apply sudo on it?   Could you edit your question and list the output of `cd /usr/bin/ && ls -l | grep pod2man` in it? <comment349505> Sure. Permissions are definitely wrong, I just don't know how to fix the situation. I installed Brew by copy and pasting their command. I did fix the OS's permissions, that might have caused all this.
