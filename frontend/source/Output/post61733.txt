How to make MacOS X ignore nice load when scaling CPU frequencies ("ignore_nice_load" on Linux)? <body> Is it possible to control/configure the CPU frequency governor on MacOS X?  I would like it to ignore load/work from "niced" processes and not spin up the CPU frequency?  On Linux this can be controlled via the sysfs interface (/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/ignore_nice_load).  This way long running processes in the background (e.g. BOINC) do not cause the fan to go up.
