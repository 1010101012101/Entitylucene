How can I check which SMC version I am using? <body> I formatted my hard driver and reinstalled ML. I'd like to know whether I need to reinstall the latest SMC update or that once I install it is saved forever on the system.  I think that I don't need to reinstall it, because power sleep is enabled, and if I'm not mistaken it updates this feature, am I wrong?  In other words: Can I check which SMC I'm using?  <answer58476> strongYes./strong To check which strongSMC/strong you're using just:  ol liFrom the Apple (ï£¿) menu, choose strongAbout This Mac/strong./li liClick strongMore Info/strong./li liClick strongSystem Report/strong./li liOpen the Hardware section to reveal Model Identifier, Boot ROM version, and SMC version numbers./li /ol  Just so that you know, if you are unsure whether your computer needs a particular update, simply download and open the update installer. The installer will alert you if the firmware update is already installed or not needed.  <comment67286> Thanks for the info! what is the latest SMC update of the rMBP? <comment67289> The one you link to in your question. :) <comment67298> I meant which value should it have in system report :) <comment67309> OK, found the number, it's 2.3f32 (SMC 1.0)(http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237) <comment67313> Doh! I couldn't find the rMBP in that list!
