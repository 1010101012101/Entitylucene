change notes font in Sierra's Preview <body> I've recently moved to Sierra and, to my (pleasant) surprise, noticed that notes (Control-Command-N) in Preview no longer use that ridiculous Marker Felt font (or whatever it was called -- good riddance).  However, it seems that Apple still wants to make it hard to customize the font used for notes...  An old post (How can I change the font used in Preview PDF notes?) says it was impossible to change this font in Mountain Lion. Is that still the case in Sierra?  "defaults read -app Preview" shows a few entries starting with "PVAnnotationFont" but I played with those and they didn't seem to have an effect.
