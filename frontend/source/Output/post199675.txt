Can't update/ download apps without a card <body> I have a debit card and I've used it to buy items on the App Store. Now it's not accepting the debit card anymore and demands a new card to buy/update apps.  <answer199689> Please check the (usually) free phone support - they will help you quickly and can tell you about why this happens. Happened to me - wouldn't take my cc card. Account was flagged, flag got removed within 20 sec - continue to the app store  <answer199703> Debit cards are no longer accepted in the iTunes Store, it seems.  The available payment methods vary by country. You can typically use these methods:  ul liCredit cards/li liContent codes/li liStore credit, including iTunes Store Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, and Allowances/li liClickandBuy/li liPayEase/li liPayPal/li liUnionPay (requires SMS PIN for setup)/li /ul  So if you can use PayPal as payment type in the iTunes store. Open a PayPal account, hook up your debit card. And you up and running again.  &nbsp;  Source: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202631  <comment240421> And this is an actual Apple-branded iPhone, not an Android, correct? <comment240428> Has the card expired?
