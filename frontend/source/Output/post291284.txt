Install openvpn custom config on iPhone <body> I want to install OpenVPN on an iPhone 7 but can't get the OpenVPN app t open with the config file. I uploaded my own ovpn file to Google Drive and when I click on it it I can select "Open In" which shows me some apps including OpenVPN. If I tap OpenVPN it just flies away instead of opening the app.  <answer291289> I used the native Mail app which did work while Gmail and Drive would not work.  <comment367758> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's a [Basic Customer Support](https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/why-were-not-customer-support-for-company-x-or-product-y) question.
