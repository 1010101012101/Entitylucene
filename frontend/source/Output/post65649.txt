Is it mandatory to fill security questions and answers in order to download apps? <body> I was trying to download and install a new app, when a badge appeared on the screen. Apparently I have to choose three security question (and the corresponding answers) to improve the security of my Apple-ID. I clicked on "Not now" but in this way I can't install the app.  strongIt is mandatory to write questions and answers? Is there any way to skip the procedure and download the apps?/strong  <answer65663> Whenever there is a change in account status, it blocks all subsequent Apple ID authentication from completing successfully until you resolve the issue. I've seen this happen with:  ul liSecurity Questions / Answers when this rolled out a few months back./li liCredit Card / Billing issues./li liPurchases from a device previously unused by your account./li /ul  Only after resolving the particular issue will you be allowed to continue.
