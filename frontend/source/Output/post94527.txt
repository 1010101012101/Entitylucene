Deleted NOTE on iOS <body> I don't have notes sync to any email account, I don't have iPhone backup.   I deleted a very important note, and I would like it back.                               ul li(I am using standard "Notes" app that is pre-instilled on iOS) /li /ul  Is there a option to recover the note on iPhone (iOS 6.1.3)  iPhone: 4S-16 gb  Is there any way to recover the deleted note?   <answer95215> Unfortunately there is no way of recovering notes generally.  If you don't have a backup and did not sync notes to other devices, I see no way of recovering it. If the note had a very high value, perhaps a data forensics company might be able to recover something. But that would cost money.  <comment112167> Having lost an important NOTE once, through as far as I could tell no fault of my own, I am now extra-careful about backing them up when I (rarely) make a change in them. <comment112168> *pre-instilled* ... I like that concept.
