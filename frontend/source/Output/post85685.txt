Weird Output in terminal <body> I am using the terminal for some debugging and I noticed that it has stopped displaying my user before the path. Now its displaying (null) like so:   precode(null):mspgcc-examples dean$ /code/pre  Whats changed? As i've changed no configuration to change it. Viewing the shell variable code$PS1/code I get the following results:   precode(null):mspgcc-examples dean$ echo $PS1 \h:\W \u\$ (null):mspgcc-examples dean$  /code/pre  <answer85765> You can read through the thread on Apple Discussion Group for details. The most important that some routers doesn't like computer names which can't be part of valid DNS name (English letters, numbers, dashes, underscores).   To name my Mac I use something like codeEir-Mac/code or codeEirMac/code and have no problems.  <comment98741> please, provide your $PS1 value <comment98744> Is `$PS1` a shell variable? <comment98746> Yes, use `echo $PS1` to display its value.
