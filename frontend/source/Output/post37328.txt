Crash when using university wifi <body> I recently bought a MacBook Air 13", to use at my university (Technical University of Denmark).  But when I am using my laptop in a place with many other laptops, OSX crashes every 5 minutes (kernel panic). Other people have experienced the problem here: Apple Support Thread  Someone in the thread suggests disabling IPv6, but this does not solve the problem.  Have anybody in here experienced this problem, or can anybody figure out a solution?  I use: OSX Version 10.7.2, Build 11C74  <answer37332> After reading the linked Apple support thread, I believe the problem is likely Apple's fault. My advice is:  ul liTake the MBA to an Apple Store (with a genius bar appointment) or call Apple support to report the problem/li liMake sure you have installed all software updates (perhaps you have, but this is not mentioned)/li /ul  <comment42331> What OS X version? <comment42332> When you say OS X is crashing, what exactly is it doing? Is it a kernel panic, system hang, application crash, random shutdown, etc? <comment42333> OSX Version 10.7.2, Build 11C74. It is a kernel panic, as described in the link i supplied. <comment42339> I guess I will have to try that. But it seems somebody (lindsayfromleander) from the support thread already got a hold of Apple, with no result.
