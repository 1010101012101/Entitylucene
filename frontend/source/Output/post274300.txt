iPhone 5C Wi-Fi connection problem <body> Every time I connect my phone to the house Wi-Fi it works for about 30 seconds and then stops, not only that but it basically stops others from using Wi-Fi too.  It works on all other Wi-Fi networks but won't work at home; I did buy a new SIM card and changed networks (would this have something to do with it?)  <comment344854> I'm missing an explicit question here! <comment345014> Are all network devices using DHCP to obtain an IP address?  It sounds like IP address conflicts.
