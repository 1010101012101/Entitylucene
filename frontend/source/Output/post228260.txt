How do I get a tighter grid for MIDI editing in GarageBand 10? <body> In the previous versions of garageband, when I double-clicked on a region and the editing window on the bottom popped up, I could use the ruler button to choose how tight the quantize grid was. How to I change that grid now?  <answer228264> You can't. Apparently GarageBand is either hiding the option or it no longer exists.
