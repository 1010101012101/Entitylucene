How do I view .nfo files in Terminal? <body> I'm trying to open an .nfo file correctly with the mac terminal (eventually with iTerm2) .  I've tried it already with vim:  precodevim file.nfo :set encoding=cp437 /code/pre  But it has not helped. Maybe there are other tools? May be something in the Brew repository?  <answer81895> Your question is a bit ambiguous because you don't explicitly state what vim is or is not doing. A .nfo file is just a text file. Vim should be able to correctly handle Unicode encoded text files. If it is a codepage issue then this question on Stack Overflow should explain things:  How can I detect the encoding/codepage of a text file.  <comment94389> How about `nano file.nfo` ? or is the encoding not working? <comment94398> nano didn't helped too. I'm starting to think that there is some strange encoding.
