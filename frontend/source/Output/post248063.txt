Time Machine: Snapshots are not "complete" <body> I have been using Time Machine on 10.9.5 for quite a while now and recently needed to restore a file. I always thought that TM would copy new/modified files and make hard links for files that did not change, in order for every snapshot to appear as a complete backup.  However, this does not seem to be the case. I had to travel back in time and find the day when the file was last modified. This is ridiculous! Is this a bug? Can it be fixed? (Other than using codeln/code and codersync/code in a custom made script).  <comment306160> Good luck, Time Machine is quite difficult to figure out the guts of. You're best of probably using the provided interface or `tmutil`. <comment306166> Well the provided interface seems broken, at least, if I correctly understand its concept: Every snapshot for any chosen date should contain show *all* files, either for real or simulated by a hard link, shouldn't it? <comment306168> All files, yes, but simulated hard link or actual file... I'm not sure. I'd have to look more into the structure. However, most snapshots are incremental, not complete. It's possible that there's a bug with 10.9.5's Time Machine, as the behavior you described isn't supposed to happen, but there's probably relatively little you can do about it. <comment306258> A Time Machine snapshot shows all files that existed as of a given snapshot, whether or not they were changed between that snapshot and the prior one. That is the intended behavior. Whether or not it's working in your case is another story, of course; it may be a bug in 10.9.5 or it may be that there was a problem when your snapshots were created. <comment307548> Thanks for the confirmation. I have been using TM since 2013 and the problem existed well before switching to 10.9.5. And there have been no error messages whatsoever. As a consequence, I will get back to my own rsync based backup method.
