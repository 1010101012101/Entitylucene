How to shuffle all songs by an artist in macOS iTunes? <body> It seems like I can only shuffle songs within a single album for an artist. I want to shuffle all the songs from 1 artist.   Found this question abou shuffling songs on iOS, but I have the same question for iTunes in macOS.   <answer249912> How about: 1) create a smart playlist matching the artist name; 2) select the playlist; 3) hit shuffle.  Just a thought.
