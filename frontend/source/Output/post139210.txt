Is there a way to prevent a Macbook Air from sleeping when external monitor is plugged in but power is not? <body> I have a 13-inch Mid 2012 Macbook Air running 10.9.3. I usually run with the lid closed plugging into 2 Apple cinema displays. Everything works great, except when I accidentally bump the power cable, at which point it goes to sleep.  Is there any way to prevent this? Clearly it isn't a power issue, because with the lid open and no power cable it drives all 3 monitors just fine.  <answer139211> The power adapter is required for closed display mode on any Apple portable machine, without it you can't use closed display mode.   Reference:  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3131  There is however a third party solution, called Caffine.  Which when enabled, forces the mac to stay on until the battery dies, it won't ever sleep.  http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/  <answer139217> I was hoping to figure out how to do this with the pmset utility (man page). I feel like it's possible, but I couldn't see anything obvious (to me) looking through the options.   Anyway, here's another app that will do what you want: https://code.google.com/p/macosx-nosleep-extension/  <comment164182> I think it's possible, if you're comfortable with terminal stuff. Back in a moment with that... <comment165457> Thanks, the issue is that now I have to remember to enable/disable Caffeine when I want to switch between these behaviors. It would be nice if there was something conditional on the power adapter. <comment165458> Bummer, I've looked into the no sleep extension, and again the issue is I have to remember to enable/disabled it. For now I just moved my laptop into a spot where it's a lot harder to accidentally bump the power cable. <comment165483> It could be done still. What you would need to do would be to make a daemon that periodically checks if an external display is connected, and when it is, place a no sleep assertion or run one of those utilities. This might help you get started: http://superuser.com/questions/278082/linux-how-to-run-a-script-when-an-external-monitor-is-connected <comment165731> Thanks for the tip, that looks like the only way to do it. I was looking into Scenario (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scenario/id423444193?mt=12) but it looks like it doesn't detect when external power is plugged in or not.
