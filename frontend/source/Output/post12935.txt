How to open a new terminal window when using VIM <body> does someone know how to open a new terminal window when opening a new text with VIM.  I would like to have an autarchic window which can be resized and closed while the other windows will stay as and where they are.  Regards  mmm...  <answer12936> You could write a little script like this :  precode#!/bin/sh osascript &lt;&lt;END tell app "Terminal" to do script "vim" END /code/pre  Name this script v and make it executable :  precodechmod +x v /code/pre  Then when you're in terminal, just execute the v script and it will open a new terminal window and run vim.  Alternatively, if you want to open a text file as part of this:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript on run argv   tell app "Terminal" to do script "vim " &amp; item 1 of argv end run /code/pre  Then just run v text.txt  and it will open a new terminal window, open vim, and open the text file called text.txt.   If text.txt doesn't exist, as usual, vim will create it in the buffer.  <answer13106> You could simply use MacVIM to handle this.  When you install MacVIM it should give you an option to install the command line shortcuts.  Then, in your Terminal, simply use codemvim/code instead of codevi/code:  precodemvim /path/to/your/file.txt /code/pre  Or, if you are super lazy, add this to your code~/.profile/code:  precodealias vi=mvim /code/pre  This also allows you to associate text files with MacVIM in finder, so you always get the right application for your files, weather you open them in the GUI or not.  <comment13583> THX. At least it should open the text file i pointed at. <comment13586> I updated my answer to allow you to open a text file pointed at the script with vim. <comment13846> Bear in mind that this only opens a new macvim window **not** a new terminal window. <comment13860> Quite true.  Thanks for pointing it out.
