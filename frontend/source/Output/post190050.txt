fixed date in numbers template <body> Is it possible to use the =today() function (or something else) to insert the current date but then not update each time the file is opened?  I want to create a numbers template for my invoices. I'd like it to auto fill invoice date and date due then, when I save the document, store the values, not the function.  I am creating templates on my mac then using the inumbers app on my iPad.  <answer198352> i'm guessing this is what you are looking for  =NOW()  <comment225742> Similar question here. http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/47413/120171 <comment237327> This will update each time
