Macbook pro external display (while in clamshell mode) won't sleep all of a sudden <body> before, when I left my macbook pro alone for 15 minutes in clamshell mode the external display would go to sleep instead of putting on a screen saver. Now all of a sudden it goes into screen saver and I have to manually put the display to sleep (using hotkeys). does anyone have any idea why this could be ? If it helps i'm running 10.10.5... and my power savings setting hasn't changed.   <comment252213> I assume by "clamshell" you mean closing the lid? Did you check your screen saver settings? It should be the same or less that the display sleep in the Energy settings. <comment252215> so what your saying is that if my screen saver time is greater than my display sleep time it won't work ?
