How do I share bluetooth keyboard with iPhone and iMac without re-pairing every time? <body> This may be an impossible request, but I'm looking for some way, or some software to install, that lets me choose which device I want to type on at a particular moment.   For example: Most of the time I am typing on my iMac. But when a text message comes in, or I want to type a long password on my iPhone, I want to use my apple bluetooth keyboard to type on my iPhone for a bit, and then switch back to typing on my iMac.  <answer42971> While a device (iMac or iPhone) can have a number of peripherals attached it it, a peripheral can only be attached to one device at a time. So you will need to re-pair it every time.  <answer43377> try ikeyboard in the mac app store  <answer52440> I just came across this keyboard from Logitech that is a hardware solution to do what you want.  This keyboard is a MAC keyboard that can be programed to switch devices with one button.   <comment48861> Duplicate of: [Can you pair Mac AND iPad with same Apple Wireless Keyboard?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/23924/14994) - [Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/23927/14994) <comment48862> I'm not sure you can without getting a second keyboard. I normally turn off Bluetooth on whichever device I don't want using the keyboard. <comment48863> That is a good point. The problem is more with the bluetooth hardware vs. the Mac (or iOS) software. <comment48867> Not a duplicate because I don't want to pair with both. I'm looking for a software solution <comment60033> Thanks, i saw that this morning too and I think I might get it! iKeyboard has been working out well, too. <comment60034> Perfect, this is a great app!
