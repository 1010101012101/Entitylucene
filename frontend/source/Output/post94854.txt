Firewall with application rules for iPad <body> I've read some other topics about emnot needed/em firewall for iPad's, but I'm searching the other way of security or (more important) to help my budget. I need firewall that has incoming/outcoming rules for every app. Rules should be remembered and asked only once, but easily to change. Good would be having profiles which I could switch when needed.  Is something like this available for iPad? Is it working without Jailbreak?  P.S. It should block apple services too when I want to.  <answer94868> There is no such app on an non-jailbroken iPad.  Apple doesn't allow the low level access to the system would be needed to implement such a thing.  If you are concerned about running up data charges your best option is probably to turn cellular data on or off as needed.  From a security perspective you try an external firewall when connected to a network you control.  <answer94883> h2Firewall iP/h2  Firewall iP lets you block connections from apps on your jailbroken iOS device. You can set up custom rules to block/allow certain TCP &amp; UDP connections.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n8Akz.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wBt2T.png" width="200" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1f0SG.png" width="200"  hr  h2iOS 7/h2  In response to your comment about 3G data, in iOS 7 you can specifically set certain apps/services through your 3G data connection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k6US0.png" width="300" title="iOS 7 Cellular Connection Settings"  <comment111225> iPad is for me an device on the go only, so I'm connecting to spots around the world. when I turn 3G on updates are checked and so on that makes costs. for Jailbroken iPad can I find something what I'm asking about? <comment111227> There are firewalls available for jail broken iOS devices. <comment111234> what are names of them? I can't find any with rules. can you give me some concrete examples? <comment111242> I've never used it, but Firewall iP is the one that comes up in my searches. <comment111249> is it good as they are writing about? made by trustworthy developers? <comment111251> I have used Firewall iP in the past, and it works great, especially with the new update for iOS 6 with the new interface design (that was one of the things I didn't like about the old Firewall iP). tl;dr Yeah it's great :) <comment111272> oh, great! So I have to check how to Jailbreak my iPad and test it. Thank you very much! <comment111273> apropos iOS7 - it is for 3g mainly, but I want to block some apps from wifi too. Privacy maniac ;)
