iCal events changed to default "New Event" on Macbook <body> When I try to enter an appointment/event into my iCal on my Macbook the event is changed to "New Event" at 9 am as soon as I press return.  All of the appointment information I just entered is cleared out (appointment name and time).  The only info correctly retained is the specific calendar that I have assigned the event to (my personal calendar, my daughter's, my work, etc.)  If I click on the "New Event" appointment and re-enter the information it will then be saved correctly.  <comment234455> Have you found a solution on that issue, I have a similar problem. But some things are random. Sometimes it remembers the time, sometimes the title of the event and sometimes the iCloud calendar. But in almost no case it remembers all settings at once.
