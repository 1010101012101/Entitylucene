how to stretch a single wallpaper image across multiple monitors <body> I would like to stretch the emsame/em image across multiple monitors.. how do i do that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qYPMD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285681> Your picture actually is the perfect example of why this is incredibly difficult to do automatically.  You have 3 totally different screens [&amp; for this the actual distinction as to whether one is a Retina or not is moot]    Visually you have one small, one large &amp; one in portrait.  Bear in mind this is emextremely/em rough...  If you divide the picture into 3rds, one third to each screen, then you get this...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yN62G.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The left monitor has what was a 'tall' ⅓ now squished to fit the screen.br Same for the centre monitor.br The right monitor has it's ⅓ give or take, about right.  The alternatives would be to eliminate any portion that doesn't fit,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/axFaQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  or shrink it &amp; leave blank space around it.... (but I'm sure you get the idea by now ;)  Really, the only way to do this &amp; have reasonable control over it is to do it manually, then set each portion to each screen.
