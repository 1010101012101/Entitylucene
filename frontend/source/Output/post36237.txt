How to Access Network services on a MBP with Lion Behind an ISA server <body> I have a MBP running OSX lion. I work in an academic environment where every thing is windows based. The campus runs an ISA server for security and all the services (mail, msn messenger, java ) are available on each windows client one they have entered the proxy server in the settings and installed an ISA client.  I am the only person in the entire campus who has a MBP. I have updated the settings provided (proxy and port numbers) in my system preferences and in Fire Fox preferences.   ol liI Can browse the web using fire fox and safari./li liSkype can login with out any configuration changes./li liBUT apple mail does not connect to Gmail and Hotmail and does not retrieve the mail.
