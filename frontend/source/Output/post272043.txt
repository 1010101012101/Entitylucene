Why do I lose ~15GB when I start macOS, and get it back after a few minutes? <body> I recognised a "weird" behaviour under codemacOS 10.12.3/code. When I start my Mac, and look at the hard drive usage, I am always around 15 GB under my normal amount of free space.  After a while though (1-2 minutes), the 15 GB are back.  Have a look here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z25d7.png" alt="enter image description here"   And after 1 minute:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0A31U.png" alt="enter image description here"     Does anybody have the same behaviour when starting their Mac?   strongI am running my Mac in beta versions of macOS, so maybe it's a installer taking up space and then removes itself again?/strong  How can I see what is taking so much space? Once I start up a disk space tool, by the time it is finished the space is back.
