Tab key not working properly in dialogue boxes in macOS <body> I change the setting ‘Full Keyboard Access’ (the Keyboard settings in the ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ tab) from ‘Text Boxes and Lists Only’ to ‘All controls’. Now, I am able to press kbdTab/kbd to moving focus, as illustrated below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0aaS3.png" width="451"  When I hit kbdEnter/kbd, pop up a window, instead close the window.  My desired action: hit kbdEnter/kbd → move to ‘Don't Save’ → kbdEnter/kbd → Close the window.  <answer254138> Hitting Return will activate the default command (the blue button). Pressing the space bar will activate the selected command (blue ring around it).  <answer254142> Fewer key presses would be just kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ⌫ /kbd which is always "Don't Save"  Some older apps may still use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd D /kbd but all modern apps should now use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Backspace ⌫ /kbd   <comment316364> Depends on what keyboard you have. Full-sized keyboards have separate Backspace & Delete buttons, with Delete acting as Forward Delete. If you only have a short keyboard, then I guess you'd have to do whatever you normally do to trash a file from Finder. Cmd/Del doesn't delete on a full keyboard, Cmd/Backspace does. <comment316375> No, it has the standard international symbol for Backspace on it. US English is not the only English in the world... US keyboards have had conventions contra to the rest of the world since typewriters were invented & I doubt they'll join the rest of us any time soon. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backspace <comment316376> I guess I've been using US Mac's for to long. I just dug out an old Windows PC keyboard and it has "Backspace ←" on it. So this is really more an Apple difference with US keyboards vs a UK keyboard, not US English vs. the Queen's English. :)
