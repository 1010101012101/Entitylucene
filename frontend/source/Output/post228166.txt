Can I find my stolen iPhone if someone reset it and uses different AppleID? <body> I recently bought an iPhone iOS 9.2.1. I am worried, if someone stole it, reset it and uses different AppleID, can I find it?  <answer228167> Just be sure to switch on Find My iPhone in Settings  iCloudbr then not only can it not be reset by anyone without your AppleID &amp; password, but can be     ul liPinged to play a sound [if you just lost it in the house],  /li liremotely put into Lost Mode [which will enable you to put a message on the lock screen, with another phone number to be contacted at, if someone finds it],  /li lior in extreme circumstances, remotely wiped [though this will itself then disable Find my iPhone]./li /ul  All this can be done from another iPhone or on the iCloud web site at https://www.icloud.com/#find  See this question &amp; answer to see just how impossible it is for a thief to be able to reset it once you've secured it - How can I bypass Activation Lock?  <comment278148> It can't be reset if you do not know the AppleID password. <comment278153> Welcome to Ask Different. Your question hinged on whether you were successful in applying an activation lock to the device. Does it show up when you log in to https://www.icloud.com/activationlock/ or in your devices when you log in to https://www.icloud.com/#settings? (or is what I wrote above the answer you are seeking?) <comment278154> Thanks for the fast answer I saw many videos in youtube that you can reset an iphone if you forgot a password, thats why i am asking. If he reset it and uses different AppleID can i still find it? <comment278155> @ThodwrhsKontoprias See the last paragraph in tetsujin answer for a link to a long discussion on what can and cannot be done to bypass a lock.
