cant sync songs to my iphone 5 after latest upgrade to 6.1.4 <body> i recently upgraded my ios to 6.1.4. during the upgrade it completely wiped all my data and so i did a restore which worked fine. but now i cannot add any new music to my iphone. when i do sync music it appears to work and the memory indicator on itunes actually decreases like its supposed to. when i disconnect and go to the music app on my phone the new songs are just not there only the songs from when i did a restore from backup. i have 3gb of memory available so its not that i dont have any memory left. please help.  <comment115059> You may have to restore to 6.1.4 again. When you plug in your iPhone 5, click it when it pops up in iTunes and then click `Restore`. After it restores, try syncing your music again. <comment115062> Im having the same problem, i have tried pretty much everything... reboot phone, re-syc itunes, changing the preferences and options settings, manually uploading, wi-fi sync opposed to cable sync and no joy?! are their any genii out there that can help??
