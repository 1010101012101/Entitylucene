How to create (the missing) El Captain recovery partition? <body> I upgraded from Snow Leopard to El Captain.  Before upgrade I had a bootcamp partition, and a third FAT32 partition. this caused some complications in the upgrade process and I had to delete the El Captain recovery partition (as well as my FAT32 partition).  Now I have two partitions: El Captain in my macintosh partition, and windows in my bootcamp partition, and everything is working fine.   Just that I do not have the El Captain Recovery Partition. Is there a way I can create it manually ? So that just in case something goes wrong I can recover.  (I know about the recovery USB stick, but I want to have recovery on the same HDD)  EDIT: I re-installed the El Capitan. It went smooth. Now I have a 650MB recovery partition. Isn't it supposed to be 6 GB partition?   Thanks  <comment254669> Have you tried reinstalling OS X? <comment254672> Do it only if it is absolutely necessary. There is always the internet based recovery in case something goes wrong and it doesn't take as much space. <comment254927> Can you refresh the OS X 10.11 installation? What happens if you try to download El Captain and install from the App Store? <comment255952> @Soroosh, how can I access internet recovery option when there is no recovery partition to boot system from? <comment255954> I re-installed the El Capitan.
