Shortcuts suddenly stopped working in Chrome browser <body> I don't know why but all shortcuts related to controlling tab in chrome suddenly stopped working and i have no idea why.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uo8Ai.png" alt="enter image description here"  I haven't installed or changed anything. Just doing the same usual work. The only recent thing that I did earlier (which I never did before) was, opening the emoji keyboard using the control+cmd+space shortcut.  <answer273891> Alright I found the solution.  Apparently, Chrome disables tab shortcuts when it's in fullscreen mode.  I exit the fullscreen and now the shortcuts are working...
