GUI/UI is messed up? (Lion) <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxBWM.png" alt="Contextual menu is broken"  Using Mac OSX 10.7.5.  The contextual menu text is barely even visible. I have restored GUI files from a MacBook with a non-tampered with version of OSX (Modified files: codeSArtFile.bin/code, codeArtFile.bin/code, and codeArtFile200.bin/code) but I haven't gotten any luck. It's becoming increasingly harder for me to work with this happening. I would like help on fixing the problem (w/o wiping the system, preferably.)   <comment237682> did you try changing the screen resolution ? Or changing the Color profile in the ColorSync Utility? <comment237683> Either it's been too long since I've seen Lucida Grande, or that's not the system font... <comment237685> @user24601 It's not, but the font change does not correspond with the UI error. (If you're wondering, it's Ubuntu.) <comment237686> @Buscarì›ƒ It was working fine on the settings I had, this just popped up a week ago. <comment237687> could you disclose all the information including your custom settings. For example, is it just the contextual menu text? <comment237689> It is just the contextual menu. Only GUI modification is the font (which is not associated with this issue.) <comment237766> I'm placing a temporary hold. "Any help" is far too broad. Please decide if you want help diagnosing the issue, help with backing up so you can wipe the system and start over, or whatever else needs a more narrow answer. It's not even clear what you did with the "fresh install" so if that's what you want to get feedback on, please document that operation with a little specific details. <comment237805> @bmike Not sure if adding the bit that I did is enough, is it? <comment237817> Please could you explain how your composite OS X is created? What version of OS X is installed and exactly what files are then changed, reverted, or subverted manually or by third party software.
