Mac os x ipfw forward from ip:port to ip:port <body> I want when on my local machine redirect from 192.168.64.88 port 80 to localhost port 9790. How can I do it with ipfw rule?  <answer81962> I found the solution:  precodesudo ifconfig lo0 192.168.64.88 alias sudo ipfw add fwd 127.0.0.1,9790 tcp from me to 192.168.64.88 dst-port 80 /code/pre  After a restart you have to run this commands again.  <comment93374> Poor man's solution would be to use `http://localhost:9790` in the browser. I assume this is not an option for you? <comment93375> It is not an option <comment94637> You can define a launchd entry to automatically execute these commands on a reboot.
