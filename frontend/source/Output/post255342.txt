Synching my iPhone 6s with a iTunes on a new Mac <body> everytime i pludge my iphone to mac, there is a notification says "iTunes could not connect to the iPhone ‚Äù because an invalid response was received from the device." and the iphone doesnt want to connect. so what should i do?   <comment318039> What version of macOS are you using and what version of iTunes? Also try using a different USB cable, if available, as well as trying different USB ports on the computer. If you are using a USB hub, try plugging directly into the computer. Try unplugging all other USB devices while you're testing.
