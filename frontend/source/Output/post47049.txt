Creating a new iPhone contact from an email in a specific address book <body> I have two e-mail accounts on my iPhone 4, one of which is my "work" Exchange account, and I therefore have two sets of address books ("From My Mac" and "Work").  From an e-mail, and also from the Phone's Recents list, if I select an e-mail address or phone number and then select "Create New Contact", I am not given an opportunity to select the address book that it should be added to. It emalways/em adds it to my work (Exchange) address book.  How do I select which address book I to create a new contact in? Alternatively (and less preferably) how can I move the contact after-the-fact from one address book to the other.  I'm not interested in solutions that involve having to sync with my mac every time, using iCloud, Google Mail or anything that I have to pay for.  <answer47054> Unfortunately, there is no built-in way to do this. However, there are some third-party apps that fill this gap. A free one that I've tested and works is OrbiContacts. The interface isn't especially pretty, but it does work.
