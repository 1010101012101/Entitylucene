iPhone 6 -random issue- callers can't hear me <body> Issues with volume .. Callers can't hear me. I can hear them when I cut on speaker. This is random.  Sometimes a reboot will help. May work several days and then go out again. Replaced sim are, factory reset, and still no luck.   <answer252782> This happened to me too on iPhone 6 plus for a while - I don't necessarily have a solution, but I do have a process that's slightly less annoying than a factory reset.   When you reboot - I assume you are just switching off &amp; back on? Apologies if this is already how you're rebooting, but just in case it's not:  Instead, try quitting all your apps, then press the home &amp; power buttons at the same time &amp; hold down for about 10 seconds - it will reboot, but it's a hard reboot, and I found that this got rid of the problem for longer than a regular off &amp; on reset.   I've also found that it comes &amp; goes with software updates, and haven't had it for a while. Fingers crossed that today's IOS 10 doesn't have the issue!  <answer252785> Oh also - a few similar posts had some other suggestions:  ul liif you still have protective film on screen it may be interfering?/li liit could be that Apple's noise cancellation feature is being glitchy. Disable in General  Accessibility. /li lirelated to the noise cancellation feature: this is achieved with the tiny mic on the back between the camera &amp; the flash. If disabling noise cancellation fixes the problem, the issue is likely with that mic. Blocking that up has been known to work, or if you'd rather not, head into apple to see if you can get the back of the phone replaced if still under warranty./li liif the problem happens again, play with the voice memos app - this will tell you if it's a mic issue, in which case getting the mic/charge port parts replaced may be the fix instead./li /ul  Good luck!  <comment314495> Welcome to Ask Different.

When answering a call on iPhone 6s, I can hear the caller, but they can't hear me at all. Happens randomly as far as I can tell.
