Any way to get better resoultion when displaying an webpage using digital av adapter on a tv <body> I'm connecting a iPod touch (5th gen wiht iOS 7.0.3) to a TV using a HDMI cable and a Lightning Digital AV Adapter.   Using an app called GardenWeb I want to display an webpage (with sales stats) in full screen. It works but I get quite crappy resolution.   Is there any way to get better resolution? I thought the iPod/iOS was capable of producing better resolution for example when displaying video.  <comment127379> what kind of resolution do you get ? is your TV a 1080 ? <comment127486> Yes I get 1080 from the iPod but it's not really 1080
