iPad fails to sync : unknown error 1140 <body> Recently whenever I try to sync my iPad to my iMac I get the following error message:  code27/04/2013 14:34:01.376 AppleMobileDeviceHelper[3815]: 3815:1917989248|AppleMobileDeviceHelper.m:_getDisabledDataClassNamesFromLockdownForTarget| ERROR: Could not find a device with the target identifier d0e43aec963246a826be357c29a086ce8a3c9365. Assuming there are no disabled data classes. /code  UPDATE I tried restoring from backup, complete factory restore and re-installing iTunes, same error. I tried syncing with my macbook and it synced without problems  UPDATE Turning off iPhoto syncing solved the syncing problem, which is a great improvement but I'd like to sync my photos. Any ideas?  <answer91659> ul liConnect iOS Device/li liGo to Photos tab in iTunes/li liUncheck "Sync Photos from iPhoto" option/li liPress "Apply" and/or "Sync/li liCheck "Sync Photos from iPhoto" option/li /ul  Now everything should be as it was before and the error is gone :D
