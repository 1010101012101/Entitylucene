What is a good HFS+ NAS or network HDD <body> I am wondering what would be a good, if any, NAS i can find with HFS+. My reason for wanting this is that I need the metainformation in the files to stay intact as I am dealing with a lot of OpenMeta tags.  For me this can be any NAS or "external HDD with network connection".  The question has been raised here (Which NAS for Mac users?) previously, but was not answered as to what drives do have HFS+.  <answer81049> So, HFS+ is a closed, proprietary format. For linux to work with this format, it needs codehfsprogs/code, which is a module that supports HFS+.  Most NAS servers use linux-native formats, so if you want HFS+-based filesystems, there are a few ways.  a) Most NAS servers are built with Linux, and most of them have command line. You can load codehfsprogs/code module and write a script to have the system mount your HFS+ formatted drives. In another word, customize the system.  b) Roll your own server, a good Synology enclosure costs about the same price as an Mac mini, you can get an external hard drive and have it running as an server.  <answer81288> Get any NAS, create and mount a NAS volume on your mac (I use afp with my Synology DS1511).  Then use disk utility to create and mount a disk image stored on the NAS which will be in HFS+ format by default.  Yes, it's an extra step but I think it will get you what you want, a mounted NAS hosted HFS+ volume.  Sidenote:  My Synology NAS is great but I have stayed with DSM 3.2, it works.  That and my NAS is not attached to the net at large.  <comment93450> Avoid Synology (even with latest DSM). Recurring dropped connections while copying files, and performance suffers from repeated file system checks. Question posed in Synology Support forum was unanswered. <comment93455> Wow. My thoughts are synology is the best around in terms of value, performance and support. I haven't been able to break one lately and most consumer NAS are easy to send into fits if you try. <comment93461> I also was gonna suggest synology, and tell him to give up HFS+. LOL <comment93462> Just what kind of metas do you need, most of them are in most file systems. <comment93466> bmike, I bought Synology after hearing anecdotal recommendation from friends. Sadly, DSM 4.1 is problematic with 64-bit OS X 10.8.2 and Synology-approved D-Link dual-band 802.11n connecting to a WPA2PSK, TKIP, hidden SSID network <comment93521> to the question on what kind of meta i need - as stated above: OpenMeta. http://code.google.com/p/openmeta/ <comment93522> So, what we are saying here is that there exists no network HDD or NAS that are built with a HFS+ formatted drive? I find that hard to believe. I hope that there is a solution where I don't have to experiment with customizing a linux server. I'm happy that it is "possible" to hack ones way into it, but I'm in a situation now where I need to buy something that "just works". So, I am afraid this does not answer my question. Thanks for your answer though :) <comment93540> @gorgon I do understand. Will you give me some information about your needs and settings, maybe I can put together a solution for you. I am planning a storage solution for my school and myself recently. <comment93541> @gorgon Also, how does OpenMeta function? How do you add meta data to a file? I haven't had a chance to read its instruction since I'm constructing a network recently. I think you should make sure that OpenMeta works IF a file is copied to another CLEAN machine like your new NAS server will be.
