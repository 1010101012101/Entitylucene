What is changing ComputerName? <body> So there is a this thing called emcomputer name/em that can be set either via Preferences - Sharing, or sudo scutil --set ComputerName "My Name"  When I use  precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName "My Name" /code/pre  and then use   precodesudo scutil --get ComputerName /code/pre  I get something stupid like "My Name (2)". My question is: What is changing the name?  Because there is a question Computer name keeps changing OSX 10.10 (14A389) which asks how to overcome automatic change, and some hah are being suggested.  I don't want to hack things, I want to know what is changing the name, so then in perspective I can just kill it.  <answer189499> strongUPDATE:/strong Updating to 10.10.4 fixes this problem. In this point release codediscoveryd/code is replaced by the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code.  emThe originally supplied answer follows.../em  This is caused by an interaction with a daemon called codediscoveryd/code (that is present in Yosemite OS X 10.10.0 to 10.10.3) and the sleep proxies that are present within Apple TVs and Airports.  I outlined a workaround here; which is basically disabling em"Wake for Network Access"/em, which is also suggested in the post you linked to. You could also stop using your Apple TV/s and Apple Airport/s if you are in a position that allows you to do so.  em9to5Mac/em reports that codediscoveryd/code has been dropped in OS X 10.10.4 beta and replaced with the previously ousted codemDNSResponder/code daemon. So this problem should be fixed in OS X 10.10.4.  <comment181628> Are you running CrashPlan? I found that kept reverting my hostname. If not, check other 3rd party apps which might be keeping ahold of the name.
