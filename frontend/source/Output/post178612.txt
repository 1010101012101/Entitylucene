Can I sell software with in-app purchases via the Mac App Store? <body> I created an OS X software with in app purchases. Can I publish this in the Mac App Store ?  <answer178678> Considering there are million of apps that have In App Purchases (IAPs) then yes.   <comment212514> Can you give an example of a *Mac App Store* (not an OS X app store) app that has IAP? <comment212551> Yes, [OmniFocus for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12) offers in-app purchases. <comment212552> Err, wait. Ian, what are you asking? What is the distinction between the "Mac App Store" and the "OS X App Store"? I've never heard the latter term used, but would assume it meant the MAS. :P <comment212631> Also 'should I sleep' has IAPs
