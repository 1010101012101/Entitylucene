Direct download of Bootcamp driver 6.1 for windows 10? <body> Hi my macbook is a late 2013 15inch model. I just did a clean installation of Windows 10 ver 1607 (anniversary edition). It is the only partition on my macbook. So I don't have any access to OSX. Now I need to install the driver package, but I couldn't find it anywhere on apple support page. Is there a direct download link for the drivers? Thanks!  Update:  ol liI don't have any OSX partition on my pc./li liI don't need to read any HFS+ file system. That file system is buggy like hell./li liThe issue has been solved by installing OSX on a flash drive and run bootcamp assistant to download the drivers. Now my Windows 10 drive is running without any problem. And I was able to read the HFS+ partition on the flash drive. So this is not a bug for me./li /ol  <answer252517> If you are running El Capitan (OS X 10.11), you can download the Boot Camp Support Software by following the steps given below.  ol liOpen the Boot Camp Assistant application./li liSelelct "Action" on the Menu Bar./li liSelect "Download Windows Support Software"./li /ol  Apple officially supports Windows 10 on the newer Macs. Generally these are the 2012 and later models. The originally released version of Windows 10 was number 1511. The Windows version can be determined by opening a Command Prompt window and entering the command codewinver/code. Below is example.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sfeWc.png" alt="enter image description here"  For version 1511, read only access to HFS+ formatted partitions can be enabled by installing the Boot Camp Support Software.   Recently, Microsoft has released a new version numbered 1607. This is referred to as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. This version has a bug that can prevent read only access to HFS formatted volumes. Here is a link to an Apple Communities web site that also confirms this bug exists. strongTherefore, if you using version 1601 of Windows 10, you many not be able to access HFS formatted volumes even if you have installed the Boot Camp Support Software./strong Until this bug is fixed, users will have to use version 1511 or find another way copy data from HFS formatted volumes.  Paragon Software offers drivers that allow read/write access to HFS+ file systems. They offer a 10 day trial period for you test the drivers. I have not done this. So I do not know if the bug also affects their drivers. Another alternative would be to allow OS X to read/write to NTFS formatted volumes. Again, Paragon Software offers this software for OS X.  <answer275138> just use https://github.com/timsutton/brigadierbrbr found it on discussions apple forumbr look for the LonerT's post Aug 25, 2015 7:24 PM in response to dioshy (quoting everything from there even though 2012 model is not your case but the solution still stands)  "1.
