Shell Script Commands Work Fine in Terminal But Not Via AppleScript <body> I have two commands that I need to run through the Terminal. They arebr codecd /Users/[my name]/Desktop/code and codecurl 'www.google.com'&gt;google.txt/code. When running these directly in Terminal they work just fine. However, when running this in AppleScript:  precodedo shell script "cd /Users/Peter1/Desktop" do shell script "curl 'www.google.com'&gt;google.txt" /code/pre  It produced the error:  precodesh: google.txt: Permission denied /code/pre  Why is this happening? What can I do to fix it?  Thanks  <answer197360> Your script above is running two different scripts. One is changing the working directory to your user desktop folder (code~/Desktop/code). The other script is downloading codewww.google.com/code and putting it in a document in your root directory (code//code), which doesn't have permissions to do so.  You can fix this by reduce it to one statement of codedo shell script/code like such:  precodedo shell script "curl www.google.com &gt; ~/Desktop/google.txt" /code/pre  In short, the script first downloads the contents of the website codewww.google.com/code and then creates a new file at the specified directory. You may also notice the code~/code character, which is equivalent to code/Users/username//code.  <comment235943> Ah, OK, thanks. I was thinking that the first command turns the working directory to the desktop, and the second saves a file there (on the desktop)
