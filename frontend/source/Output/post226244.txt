USB Microphone way too loud <body> I recently got a USB Microphone and no matter what I do, the microphone is way too loud.  I lowered the input level in system preferences to be as low as possible without being off and it's way too loud.  I also tried using codeosascript -e "set volume input volume .1"/code but that was a guess and I think it only affects the laptop's microphone, not the attached USB microphone. Here's my full terminal session:  precode~  $ osascript -e "set volume input volume 1" dlopen error : dlopen(libjack.0.dylib, 1): image not found ~  $ osascript -e "get volume settings" dlopen error : dlopen(libjack.0.dylib, 1): image not found output volume:38, input volume:1, alert volume:100, output muted:false ~  $ osascript -e "set volume input volume .1" dlopen error : dlopen(libjack.0.dylib, 1): image not found ~  $ osascript -e "get volume settings" dlopen error : dlopen(libjack.0.dylib, 1): image not found output volume:38, input volume:0, alert volume:100, output muted:false /code/pre  When I spoke with CAD tech support they said:     For some users the issue seems to be the MAC driver, specifically their failure to implement the boost enable/disable feature.   Since we don't write software we have to rely on MAC's drivers.   I was going to return it and get another one when I realized that it's probably better to figure out what's going on since the same thing could happen with another microphone (I'm a programmer :)  Any ideas? I'm A OK if I need to use the command line to set things..
