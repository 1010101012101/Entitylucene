Automator Javascript - see console.log output <body> I'm trying to get all object properties and I use  precodeconsole.log(object) /code/pre  But I don't understand where to find output? Is there a special Automator function for logging?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ylRPG.png" alt=""  hr  UPD   Using script editor. Calling console.log(object) just output type of object. Is there a way to see list of all properties/values like in web inspector?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZDRW.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8hSJ4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268373> A simple solution that will work in most cases is to just use codeJSON.stringify(obj)/code to see the object as a string in the console.  <comment279164> Can you use the Script Editor application to debug your JavaScript first? This application has a console that works. <comment279167> @DavidAnderson I tried to use Script Editor, but I don't understand how to see all object's properties. console.log just returns type of the object
