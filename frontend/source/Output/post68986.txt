Using AppleScript to open an application without the app stealing focus <body> I use iA Writer enough that I would like it to open in fullscreen on login, but unfortunately the developers have disdain for preferences.  I decided to write an AppleScript that I could add to the startup list, but I can't get it to work properly. I'd like to open a specific file using iA Writer on login, in 10.8 fullscreen mode, but without changing focus from my normal desktop, or a least automatically returning me to my primary desktop after launch. EDIT: Here is my code after suggested edits:  precodeset front_application to front window tell (application "iA Writer") to open (POSIX file "/PATH/TO/FILE.txt") activate application "iA Writer" #EDITED# tell application "System Events" to keystroke "f" using {command down, control down} #ADDED# delay 1 #ADDED# tell application "System Events" to keystroke "1" using control down end tell activate front_application /code/pre  This code successfully opens the file with iA Writer in fullscreen, but switches to the new, iA Writer-controlled desktop, waits a moment, and switches back to my main desktop.  Since OS X's change from spaces to desktops, I don't even know if it is even possible to open an application in Mountain/Lion fullscreen without it stealing focus and forcing a desktop switch.  Many thanks to @Lauri Ranta for your help thus far!  Any further help, regarding keeping iA Writer from switching desktops when becoming fullscreen, would be very appreciated. Thanks!  <answer68991> (I removed the original script, but I couldn't come up with anything better than this either.)  precodeset fw to front window do shell script "open ~/Notes/todo.txt -Fa iA\\ Writer" delay 0.1 tell application "System Events" to tell process "iA Writer"     perform action "AXPress" of (button 1 where subrole is "AXFullScreenButton") of window 1 end tell delay 1.5 activate fw /code/pre  WriteRoom has an option to open documents in custom full screen windows. If it's selected, you could use something like codeopen file.txt -Fjga WriteRoom/code.  If someone else just needs to open an application on the background, you can use codeopen -jg/code or codelaunch/code. codelaunch/code sometimes opens a visible window if an application isn't open and codeopen -jg/code if an application is open but has no windows.  precodeset b to "com.apple.TextEdit" tell application "System Events"     if bundle identifier of processes contains b then         launch application id b     else         do shell script "open -jgb " &amp; b     end if end tell /code/pre  <answer287360> In case you still have this question, use this:  precodedo shell script "open -ga 'iA Writer'" /code/pre  codeopen/code is a Terminal command that opens things. The code-g/code option opens the app in the background. The code-a/code specifies an app to open. If no files are provided, as here, codeopen/code will simply open the app with no files. If you wanted to open a particular file, you could use codedo shell script "open -ga 'iA Writer' myfile.txt"/code  <comment80308> I haven't enabled restoring app windows, since iA Writer is the only one I'd like to have this behavior. I enabled changing desktops with [CONTROL] + number keys, and added a delay of 1 before sending the [CONTROL] + 1 keystroke.  This gives iA Writer just enough time to enter fullscreen before switching. It's not ideal, as I was hoping I could get it to silently create a Lion-fullscreen second desktop without automatically switching to it, but I think this is about as good as it's going to be for now. I'll use this while looking to a more elegant solution. Thanks!
