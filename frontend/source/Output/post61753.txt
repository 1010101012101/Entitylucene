Apple iPad - intermittently crashing <body> I've inherited a 1st generation iPad.  It seems to work fine, except for the reason I inherited it, which is that every so often, whichever app is running will simply close for no discernible reason.  It also runs slow at times or even becomes unresponsive.  I've tried restoring it, closing apps, etc... but nothing it really working.  Is there something else I can do that might help?  If this were a PC I'd format the drive and re-install.   <comment71310> When you say restoring it, are you restoring it to factory defaults and using it or are you restoring a backup you made? <comment71338> Factory settings
