Can AirPods be used “seamlessly” between Mac and iOS devices? <body> Apple AirPods are supposed to work for iOS devices, Apple Watches and Macs. Apple states that the OS requirements are:     Requires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3 (source).   I am a prospective buyer of AirPods. My question is what the experience is like, when using the same pair of AirPods to switch between an iOS device and  a Mac.  ul liHow is pairing/switching done?/li liCan the experience be called “seamless”?/li liAre there any caveats that should be known from a user-perspective?/li /ul  hr  emNote:/em This is not a buying recommendation question, the goal is to produce an objective description of the pairing/switching process between iOS/macOS devices.  <answer253712> Directly from the Apple AirPods product page:     Automatic setup. Seamless switching.   AirPods connect automatically with all your Apple devices. They’re simultaneously connected to your iPhone and Apple Watch, and sound switches instantly between the devices. Want to listen to your Mac or iPad? Just choose AirPods on those devices.sup1/sup      ol   liRequires iCloud account and macOS Sierra, iOS 10, or watchOS 3./li   /ol   AirPods have the same Bluetooth technology as your iPhone / Apple Watch. They connect automatically with your Mac as the iOS devices do. On your Mac you just change 'Speakers' to AirPods.   This is a big hunch: iPhone is paired with your Apple Watch / AirPods and communicates with your iCloud account to your Mac to 'trust' these devices.  <answer253723> I think you'll probably find that your devices need to have Bluetooth 4 in order for the AirPods to work seamlessly. That would be the same list of devices as can fully support Continuity -- broadly speaking, anything that was first released in mid 2011 or later.  <answer266517> I'm an AirPods user and so far I have not found them to switch seamlessly between my 2016 MacBook Pro and iPhone 7 Plus.  The switching is manual: select AirPods on the MacBook Pro, or connect Bluetooth on the iPhone. If a call comes through on the iPhone whilst on a Skype call on the MacBook Pro, you will have to pick up on the phone.  The "simultaneous" promise, so far, is marketing BS. Maybe it will work in a future software/firmware release.  <answer294566> Ways to switch AirPods between devices signed into your Apple ID:  ul liAirplay in apps that support it/li liiPhone Control Center: Swipe Up, select AirPods/li liiPhone Bluetooth: Force Touch "Settings", select Bluetooth, connect/li liMac Bluetooth in Menu Bar: System Preferences → Bluetooth → "Show Bluetooth in Menu Bar"/li liMac Sound in Menu Bar: System Preferences → Sound → "Show Volume in Menu Bar"/li /ul  <comment315737> Thanks, I read that too. Maybe I should rephrase the question title to better reflect the questions near the end of the OP. I.e. *how* is it done, is it *objectively seamless* and are there any *caveats* that users should know that isn't represented in Apple's marketing material? <comment315738> The only thing you should be worried about is if you have non mac devices as it's still uncertain if a) they work with 3rd party hardware and b) howmany devices they can pair with. <comment315751> According to MacTracker, the mid 2011 iMacs do _not_ have Bluetooth 4.0. <comment315755> As long as you have courage. <comment332935> For me it does not work as expected. I want to use AirPods to listen to music on my MacBook via iTunes and when my iPhone rings I want to use them to speak on the phone. But therefor I have to go into Bluetooth settings on my iPhone to connect them first :( <comment333766> @ThomasEinwaller is there a solution to this matter? <comment334156> I'm tempted to edit out seamless since that's causing subjective opinion to enter the answers this as opposed to "objective"  description. this probably needs to be split into "how does pairing work between AirPods and multiple devices" and how does switching work between AirPods and multiple devices" - having one question per question works best here. <comment334168> Isn't the simultaneous connection technically true in the current implementation? I get the "BS" attribution if you feel Apple is saying they switch automatically - I don't read that in their marketing, but I can't say you're wrong if that's your take from the brief words or your impression of the larger marketing campaign. <comment335234> no, looks like being connected to 2 devices at the same time so switching is  required <comment335763> @bmike They do apparently switch to your watch automagically, but not so much the Mac. At least that's what I'm getting from [this iMore post](http://www.imore.com/how-use-your-airpods#pairmac). I could've sworn the keynote pitched the AirPods as swapping seamlessly from iPhone to Mac myself. I may have misheard, but that doesn't appear to be the case. <comment341242> Also works with **Apple TV, 4th generation**. But perhaps not automatically. See this Question: [Which Apple TV generations support the use of AirPods?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/267140/17907) <comment349419> You can use [Airfoil](https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) to send the audio to a Bluetooth 4.0 compatible Mac, and then connect the AirPods to that Mac. This is the way I listen to AirPods on my 2011 iMac via my MacBook Pro. <comment370834> I've now had the AirPods for about 6 months. While there were some pretty obvious limitations right from the start I do agree with you. I would definitely not call the experience 'seamless' because the UX is too stupid still. I have a huge list of feature improvements I'd like, but the ability to switch to the iPhone via the flick of a Mac GUI button when there's an incoming call would be good. Answering incoming iPhone (Facetime) calls on the Mac is pretty useless because the AirPod microphone SCO codec sucks.
