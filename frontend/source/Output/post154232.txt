Strange Wired Mac Keyboard behavior <body> My wired mac keyboard is acting weird. Some keys perform weird extra insertions. The problem introduced itself when I relogged in after sleep mode and persists since then. The internal MacBook keyboard is not affected. I suspect some corrupted driver settings/files.  I tried the following already, without change:  ul lilogin with a different user/li lirestarting the mac/li lidis-/reconnecting the keyboard/li /ul  Some of the extra insertions happening:  ul liu = strongu[/strong/li li7 = strong7-/strong/li lireturn = creates a new line and an strong*/strong/li lim = strongm/strong and a space character/li lij = strongj'/strong/li liright arrow = performs a strongreturn/strong/li /ul  I am on strongOS X 10.9.5/strong  Edit: I plugged the keyboard into a Windows machine, same problem. So it's a hardware issue ... or is it? Is it possible that the keyboard firmware is somehow corrupt? Since many keys are acting strange and not ONE key that's broken.  Can I reset the keyboard firmware?  <answer154254> I ended up carefully removing all the key caps (like shown here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_Cue2IlXIg) and cleaning up the dust/dirt that accumulated over the past two years. I guess it messed with the electronic contacts.  <comment181500> What is "Fritz" ? <comment181501> *being on the fritz* means *acting weird*, updated the question. <comment181502> Thanks :) did you check your keyboard selection is sys pref <comment181503> what do you mean with *keyboard selection*? It's active and in use. <comment181504> I know that, the question is what keyboard layout is selected in sys pref keyboard? try changing it to US Extended to see. <comment181506> Thanks, unfortunately changing to US Extended did not help. Changing back to US neither. <comment181508> Have another computer you can connect the keyboard to? Might possibly be the keyboard has a fault in it. <comment181509> Thanks, see edit in the original post. <comment181516> So what keyboard type is it ? it is not the driver but did someone spill stuff on it? did you try the usual mechanical cleaning- blowing ect ?
