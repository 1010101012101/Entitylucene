Spotlight's Privacy tab not backed up by Time Machine? <body> I just did a full restore from Time Machine and noticed that my Spotlight Privacy tab was empty. Am I correct in assuming that this information is not backed up by Time Machine? I believe it's stored in code/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions.plist/code, and therefore it shouldn't be backed up because Time Machine doesn't back up a lot of the hidden files, especially in the root directory (code/.fseventd/code being the example that comes to mind).  So is it true that it isn't backed up? And why isn't it stored in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist/code then?  <answer69207> Default Time Machine exclusions are in the file /System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist  In 10.7.5 this file has a section named: PathsExcluded Which contains: /.Spotlight-V100  So it is very likely that /.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions.plist will not be backed up by Time Machine.  I don't know where the "Spotlight Privacy tab" preferences are stored.  <comment80375> The Mac OS version you are using, is missing. <comment81334> Sorry; I'm using OS X 10.8.
