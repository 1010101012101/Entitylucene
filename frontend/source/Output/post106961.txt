How can I hide file tags? <body> I'm tagging USB and network drives in Mavericks, and I would like the tags to disappear from my Mac when the drives are disconnected. Is this possible?  <answer107025> ol liDisconnect the external drive./li liNavigate to Finder - Preferences... - Tags./li liDelete the desired tag. Confirm./li liReconnect the external drive./li liThe tag will reappear./li liDisconnect the external drive./li liThe tag will disappear./li /ol  I'm curious if there's a more permanent solution, such as a way to create tags so that they're transient in the first place.  <comment140256> In Ask Different Chat, an idea: http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/13652564#13652564 (sorry, I can't provide test results at the moment)
