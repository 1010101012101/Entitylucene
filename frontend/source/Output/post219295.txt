OSX paste images as inline by default in Pages 5.x? <body> When I paste an image, it is pasted as floating. (even thou I had the cursor set to the text position).  I then have to manually change emtext wrap/em to eminline with text/em every single time. (similar to This post)  It seems pasting behaviour changed in pages 5.x. I tried command clicking to where I want the image (as oppose to clicking on the margin), but it's still inserted as floating.   I cannot find a way to set default pasting behaviour, is this somehow possible?
