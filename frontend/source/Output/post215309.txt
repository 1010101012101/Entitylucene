How does Fandango know my real credit card number through Apple Pay? <body> The Fandango app recently released an update featuring Apple Pay support. I just bought movie tickets using Apple Pay, but when I got my e-receipt, the "Payment Summary" section said:     emPayment Summary/em      MasterCard ***********_ _ _ _ (Apple Pay):    [total cost]      My Total Order [total cost]   The "[total cost]" and the four underscores are my edits for my own security, but the email displayed the actual last 4 digits of my credit card number. I've made purchases using my credit card on my Fandango account in the past, but if I used Apple Pay here, shouldn't Fandango be seeing only my device-specific number?  (iPhone 6, iOS 9.2 Public Beta 3)  <answer215442> I found this on google:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lfN5x.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seams that they definitely should not have the last 4 digits of your card, but they do mention showing the last 4 digits of your device account number.
