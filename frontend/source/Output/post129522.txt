How can I call/message on iPad air with SIM? <body> I have purchased an iPad Air with cellular but I cannot send and receive messages.  The name of the SIM company has appeared and I have connected it with my router. There is no icon for calling either, just an icon for messages.  <answer129524> You can't without jailbreaking. The SIM for the iPad air is for the data network only. You can't make or receive phone calls, nor send or receive SMS/MMS messages.  <answer161821> I make phone calls on my iPad using Tugo app from O2, works off my O2 phone account.  <comment151589> Why is jailbreak required ? <comment151590> @Buscar Because Apple don't allow it <comment151610> @grgarside is correct in that a non-jailbroken iPad cannot send/receive SMS/MMS messages, but it can send iMessages. Of course, this is only of use if the people you're in contact with use Apple devices...
