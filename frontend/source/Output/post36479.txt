How do I configure a VPN in Lion? <body> I've tried to configure VPN in Lion (both L2TP and PPTP), but it never connected successfully.  The same VPN works fine in Windows 7 and the iPad and other mobile devices, so I think it could be a problem with Lion.  Did I miss something when trying to configure the VPN?   My system is Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 (11C74).  hr  Below is the log file.

Maybe it prevents the needed communication between the VPN device and your computer. <comment41547> I regularly connect to multiple VPN's using Lion. I would make sure you have the authentication settings correct. <comment41586> thanks for your answer, the firewall is not open and allow all connections in.   I guess it might be line problem? I'm in china, using ADSL, using a wireless route and dial through PPPOE.   Is it possible the ppp program on lion is not compatible with the PPPOE? or need I modify some configuration of the ppp prpgram?   However, the vpn works fine on my win7 PC and ipad(using the same net topology), so it should not the vpn's provider's problem. <comment41627> thanks for your answers!I input the wrong share password in l2tp, now I can connect vpn using l2tp.
