How do I mount a disk read-only in the OS X installer? <body> It looks like Macintosh HD is mounted read-only when the installer is running. I don't have enough space to do an update and would need to remove a directory, so that the installer would continue.  On linux it's trivial to remount a disk as read-write in single user mode, but I can't figure out how to do it in OS X while in the installer? Anyone know how to do this? Searching on Apple's forums seems to come up with answers from clueless people that don't address the actual problem of remounting it, which should be easily doable.
