Using a script to notify when a Personal Storage device was inserted into Mac <body> I'm new to Macintosh. Is it possible in macOS to create a certain "script" that will notify both the user and the admin whenever a flash drive/personal storage device is connected to the Mac  <answer287457> Although not a script, this tiny bit of Swift code, will report any disk insertions either physical or virtual. It may be of assistance to you:  precodeimport Foundation import DiskArbitration  let session = DASessionCreate(CFAllocatorGetDefault().takeRetainedValue())  DARegisterDiskAppearedCallback(     session!,     nil,     { (disk, context) in         if let name = DADiskGetBSDName(disk) {             print("Disk inserted: " + String(cString: name))         } },     nil)  DASessionScheduleWithRunLoop(session!, CFRunLoopGetMain(), CFRunLoopMode.defaultMode.rawValue)  RunLoop.main.run() /code/pre  <comment362943> Appreciate your help bro, I'm more into script. Tho I want to try the code you gave. i don't have idea how can I run that. <comment362944> You should be able to run the command "swift" from the command-line, and macOS should offer to install command-line utilities for developers. After that, you'll be able to run the command "swift", and just copy and paste this into the prompt you get to try it out. <comment362945> or just run `xcode-select --install` first <comment362948> I already tried the code and got and error`repl.swift:10:12: error: initializer for conditional binding must have Optional type, not 'UnsafePointerInt8'         if let name = DADiskGetBSDName(disk) {            ^ repl.swift:16:60: error: use of unresolved identifier 'CFRunLoopMode' DASessionScheduleWithRunLoop(session!, CFRunLoopGetMain(), CFRunLoopMode.defaultMode.rawValue)                                                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~ repl.swift:18:1: error: use of unresolved identifier 'RunLoop' RunLoop.main.run() ^~~~~~~` <comment362950> @jquiambao what version if macOS are you running? <comment362951> OS X EL Capitan  | 10.11.6 <comment362958> Actually managed a workaround, What I'm thinking now is, How can I run the script that I created when the flash drive was inserted. <comment362959> That might be it. Iâ€™m running 10.12
