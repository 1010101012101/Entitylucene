Installation of the "Ubuntu Hollywood" Package <body> How do I install the "Ubuntu Hollywood" package on a Mac? (https://github.com/dustinkirkland/hollywood)  I am running El Capitan 10.11.6  <comment324490> To the best of my knowledge that is designed to run on Linux, not macOS <comment324498> Is it possible to do though? <comment324534> You could try running it in a Linux VM on your Mac.
