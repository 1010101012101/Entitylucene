Where are my iPod videos after I sync to iTunes? <body> I did sync my iPod with iTunes, but I can't see where are my videos on iTunes (videos I recorded using the iPod). Any hint?  <answer114755> iTunes doesn't sync videos/photos back from your device. The Photos tab in iTunes for the device is only for syncing photos/videos from an iPhoto/Aperture library or folder to your device. It doesn't sync the other way — from your device to the library/folder.  You need to use something like iPhoto/Aperture or Image Capture.     h3subimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OTYx1.png" height="30"/sub Transfer images and other items from your device/h3      Transfer images, video clips, and MP3 sounds to your computer from many cameras and devices that contain a camera, such as your iPhone.

Connect your device to your Mac and then select the device. Go to the Photos tab and check sync Photos. Underneath there will be a checkbox for Include Videos. I have my videos sync with iPhoto. Once they are in iPhoto, just drag the video to the desktop to use as you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9yDju.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer115003> Just realized I can copy the videos from iPod in Windows Explorer, like I do with a pendrive.  <comment134413> Just realized I can copy the videos from iPod in Windows Explorer, like I do with a pendrive...
