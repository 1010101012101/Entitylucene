How to stop Siri from playing undownloaded purchased songs <body> Here is an interesting one:  ol liI have 264 purchased songs downloaded on my iPhone/li liIf I go "Songs  Shuffle" it goes 1 of 264/li liIf I go "Siri  Play songs shuffled" it goes 1 of 456/li /ol  So basically, if I use Siri, it keeps shuffling through every song I have purchased rather than just the ones that have been downloaded onto my iPhone.  I have already tried:  ol liSettings  Music  Show All Music Off/li liSettings  iTunes &amp; App Store  Show all music off + Automatic downloads music off/li liSettings  Usage  Music delete + iTune sync to put back only the songs I wanted/li /ol  How do I stop this?  <answer132015> I do not know about a better solution than logging out of the Apple Store. It will prevent Siri from accessing your purchased songs library from there.  <comment155432> Clever solution! After googling many users had the same issue but no one had a solution.
