Can Apple Preview display the page size (dimensions in inches) of a PDF? <body> If I open a PDF file using Adobe Acrobat, when I select strongFile/strong then strongProperties/strong, I can see that the strongPage Size/strong is 11 x 8.5 in.  Is there a way to access this information in Apple Preview?  <answer118606> emTools/Show Inspector/em gives you this information and more. The shortcut is KBDâŒ˜ command/KBDKBDI/KBD.  <comment318989> Is there a way to access this info from the command line. Like with pdfinfo on some other systems? <comment320021> @phs, try `sips --getProperty all`. Perhaps it'd be best if you asked a separate question.
