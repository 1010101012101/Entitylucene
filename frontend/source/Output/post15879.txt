Aperture: during Import, keys to check/uncheck an image? <body> In Aperture 3, at the beginning of the Import process, one can select/check or unselect/uncheck images one by one.  But it requires the mouse.  In the Viewer view, during that selection process, I can go to the next image easily using the keyboard, with the kbd-/kbd key, but what is the way to uncheck an image using the keyboard?   (ie without having to click on the checkbox with the mouse)  strongEdit/strong  Since I'm here, and in order not to create another question:  is there a way to have the Undo to work emonly/em on the current image, being viewed in preview?  (the default for multiple undoes, is to perform the undoes even on previously edited images (not shown during the undo) - very confusing/dangerous)  <answer15913> What can you do is to select the photos you want to import by:  ul liclick and dragging/li licmd + click to add one photo/li lishift + click to select the range from the current selected./li /ul  Then click on any photo's checkbox, and all checkboxes will be checked as well.  <answer58513> Not possible with keyboard only at the moment. For whatever reason, Apple decided to not use the default OS X behavior for toggling checkboxes (kbdSpace/kbd) in Aperture.  <comment17290> I guess it would be better to separate your questions. <comment17324> Using *only* the keyboard?
