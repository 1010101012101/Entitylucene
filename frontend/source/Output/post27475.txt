After add a page to my "read later" list, and go off-line, where's the page for me to read? <body> I can't find how to access the pages I added to "read later" with Safari in iOS5, any hint?  <answer27477> ol liStart Safari/li liAccess bookmarks (the Book icon on the toolbar)/li liPick 'Reading List' (Top entry in the table with the glasses icon)/li /ol  Unlike InstaPaper, the Reading List just collects links (not content) so you need to be online to access the articles.   <comment31540> I'm not able to read off-line? Shouldn't I? <comment31541> It's just a reading list (that syncs with your bookmarks), not an offline reader. For offline reading consider Instapaper.
