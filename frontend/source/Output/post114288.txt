Mac mini 2011-mid and SSD sata 3 <body> can someone tell me, will this ssd disc work on my mac mini, since is sata 3? As I know my mac uses sata 2?  But I'm really novice and I have no idea.  <answer114289> Yes it will works. It is not a differance, because it is backward compatible. You can find out here more if you are interested about compatibility SATA II vs. SATA III  But one thing you must take in care, that you won't reach speeds of data 3, because your bus only support sata2  <answer114367> Not sure why you think it's SATA2. According to everything I read, the mid-2011 Mini is SATA3  http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i5-2.5-mid-2011-specs.html  There are considerations related to garbage collection related to the SSD controller. The safest choice is a OWC Mercury from macsales.com since they are intended for Macs. Others may require installing a 3rd-party TRIM enabling utility.  <comment133940> So that means that I won't get out of the disc 500~/500~? <comment133941> yes but only the max. speed of sata2 that is 3.0 gbps = 375 MB/s <comment133942> Ouch, didn't know that.. thx. I was looking for disc with 500Mb/s rw. I can take a look on cheaper discs. You just save me some money... <comment133943> Are you shore that this particular SSD will work? because I heard that some discs don't work with mac. <comment133944> Why does not work?? It will works, because it is a standard 2.5 inch same size that you have your HDD in. <comment134028> sorry its bugging me, its not *a disc* ;) <comment134041> I'm not sure. I was only assuming. If that's true, it's great.. I will check that out... <comment134042> @Jakub don't get it? <comment148994> @5er Quite possibly he means that the media is more correctly thought of as an array of NAND chips than a "flat circular plate".
