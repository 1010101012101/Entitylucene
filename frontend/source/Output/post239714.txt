Open Bitlocker USB stick on OS X <body> I have a USB stick encrypted by Windows 7 built-in tool (bitlocker). I would like to open it on my OS X El Capitan.  When I open it, all I get is a file "BitLockerToGo.exe" and another "Read Me.url"  I found some pieces here and there but no full procedure for mac.  <answer239715> Actually I asked after some success because I thought it would benefit everyone ;-)  Here is the complete process. Some links are missing because I don't have enough reputation to embed them all. Sorry about that.  High-level, we "just" need dislocker.  But to install it, there are some strongdependencies/strong to resolve... we need:  ol li"Fuse for OS X"  ul liSimply download the .img on their site, open and run the .pkg installer/li /ul/li liXcode command-line developers tools  ul liI'm not sure what's the generic answer./li liOpen a terminal, and type   precodexcode-select --install /code/pre  ul liIf you get an error "-bash: xcode-select: command not found", you need to install Xcode from the App store, then start again this command./li liIf an alert windows popup asking if you want to install, click on "install" button./li liIf it prints error "xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, [...]", you're all set./li /ul/li /ul/li li"Homebrew"  ul liFollowing instruction on their website, type following in terminal:   precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre/li liIf you get an error about Xcode tools not being installed whereas you did install it, then change the path to Xcode:  precodesudo xcode-select -switch / /code/pre/li /ul/li liand obviously dislocker !  ul liDownload ZIP (available in green button "Clone or Download" on the right)/li liExtract ZIP content/li liOpen terminal and change directory to the dislocker-master directory/li liCompile and install dislocker:  precodebrew install src/dislocker.rb /code/pre  ul liIf you get an error about Xcode tools not being installed whereas you did install it, then change the path like this:  precodesudo xcode-select -switch / /code/pre/li /ul/li /ul/li /ol  hr  Don't be desperate, it's now strongtime to mount the USB stick/strong !  But it's not gonna be trivial...  ol liIdentify the device of the USB stick, using Disk Utility:  ul liOpen Disk Utility and select the USB stick drive. Somewhere you should get something like "disk3s1". Replace this example with your actual value in following lines./li liKeep Disk Utility open, it will be used in next steps/li /ul/li liEject the USB drive for example from Disk Utility (Unmount button)/li liCreate a directory for the decrypted file  precodesudo mkdir /tmp/mydrive /code/pre  Warning: this directory will have strange characteristics: it appears with "ls" but not with "ls -l" and not in the Finder wherever it is, moreover the content can't be listed, and trying to delete it often fails with strange error messages. That's why I put it in /tmp which is cleaned at every reboot./li liDecrypt the USB stick with dislocker. If disk is "disk3s1" and the password is "MyPassword", the command will look like:  precodesudo dislocker-file -V /dev/disk3s1 -v -uMyPassword -r -- /tmp/mydrive /code/pre/li liAdd the disk image to Disk Utility and mount it  precodesudo hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage /tmp/mydrive/dislocker-file /code/pre  Note: Don't try to list "/tmp/mydrive/dislocker-file" by yourself. Just assume it is there and write the path as is./li /ol  Hourray !!!, the new drive is there !  hr  Because really nothing is easy, strongto clean-up/strong you need to do the following:  ol liUnmount the drive  ul liFor example from your friend Disk Utility, select its icon and click on "Unmount" button/li /ul/li liGet rid of the image  ul liFrom "Disk Utility", select the greyed drive, and from the menu "File" select "Eject"./li /ul/li liDetach the fuse volume  precodesudo  hdiutil detach /tmp/mydrive/ /code/pre/li /ol  Only now the directory /tmp/mydrive is a plain directory that can be deleted...  hr  As you noticed the process is definitely complex and finally I just get a read-only drive. I'm interested by any better answer.  <comment341794> How about http://www.m3datarecovery.com/mac-bitlocker/open-bitlocker-encrypted-usb-drive-mac-osx.html ? <comment352848> @Marthijn "M3 bitlocker" is worth mentionning: The licensing model discouraged me from using it but reader is free to chose. <comment368102> `brew install src/dislocker.rb` failed on the `make` step.  Oddly, manually running `cmake`, `make`, and `make install` succeeded and installed it into the Cellar.
