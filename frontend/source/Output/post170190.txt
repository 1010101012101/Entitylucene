Correcting text on iOS: fixing capitalization <body> I re-write and re-organize text frequently when I type longer messages (emails, StackExchange posts, etc). That means that words that were originally at the beginning of a sentence might end up in the middle, or vice versa.  I have found that it is nearly impossible on an iOS device to change the capitalization of a word without retyping the entire word. If I try to highlight just the first letter (or to drag the highlight end-point), then it snaps back to highlighting the entire word.  Is there some technique I am missing to do this?   Or maybe some custom keyboard that would make this simple? (I haven't used any custom keyboards yet.)  Some of this is in built-in apps (iMessage, Mail), others are in 3rd-party apps ("Alien Blue" client for Reddit, Facebook app).  In case it matters, I use an iPhone 6 and an iPad Air, both with latest iOS 8.1.3.   <answer170371> This may not be entirely ideal, but if you flip your phone into landscape orientation you will get kbd&lt;/kbd and kbd/kbd keys that let you move the cursor left or right. You could tap at the beginning of the word you want to edit, then move the cursor right and delete.  These do show up on a regular iPhone 6.  <comment200069> It would probably help to have a keyboard where you can easily move the cursor, but I haven't found one yet <comment200849> They do in some apps, not in others. I've also not seen them on the iPad. But thanks, I will use the arrows when I see them.
