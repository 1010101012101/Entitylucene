Default photo filters (Chrome) for Videos in camera app <body> Is there a way I can use the default filters (mainly Chrome) provided in Camera app for Video recording?   If somebody can point me to any 3rd party app that mimics chrome filter for video, it would be real great.  EDIT: I should be more clearer, I want filters while recording the videos, not for post processing.  <answer222607> h2strongVideo Filters/strong/h2  This app is available to any iPhone or iPad running iOS 7 or higher.  It's a free app (as of the time of writing), and it comes with 8 filters, with another 7 available for purchase.  It is a standalone video-editing app.  Free filters:       ul   liMono/li   liTonal/li   liNoir/li   liFade/li   listrongChrome/strong/li   liProcess/li   liTransfer/li   liInstant/li   /ul   Export format:     ul   liFile Type : MPEG-4(Default), QuickTime/li   liRetain Metadata/li   liOptimize For Network Use/li   /ul   <answer222652> h2iMovie emby Apple/em -- Free on most newer devices./h2  To use iMovie, simply download the app (over 100MB), open Photos, find the video, click more options  img src="https://support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/Product_Help/en_US/PUBLIC_USERS/PP397/IL_MoreOptions.png" alt="", choose iMovie, then do whatever you want with your videos.

I want the filters to be applied while taking videos, just like it does with photos. <comment270087> Have you tried [Chromic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chromic-video-filters-vintage/id724295125?mt=8)?  I haven't tried it myself, and their documentation seems to be scarce (or non-existent), but it seems to be an extension to the Photos app, so it might do what you're wanting... :)  Hope it helps! <comment270928> it's too is for post processing <comment270957> Oh, OK.  There's an app for about $3 that looks like it can filter videos live - it's called [VideoFilters](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-filters/id646865161?mt=8).  Have you tried that?  Sorry nothing else has been working!
