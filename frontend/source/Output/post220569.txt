When I disable the DirectLinks safari extension, it works correctly. Hat tip to @patrix.  <comment266976> Works this way here, do you have any extensions installed which may interfere? <comment266978> ah, i posted my answer before the picture arrived… let me know what happens & I'll tweak the answer… or bin it... <comment266979> @Tetsujin yeah, my bad on the initial image link. You could probably delete your answer now, it was that there extension what did it. <comment266980> I'll leave it, just in case anybody finds the question on Google & it *might* help [so long as people don't downvote me into submission ;)
