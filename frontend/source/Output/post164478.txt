No file or directory names are shown in Finder at home directory <body> Finder does not show file and directory names in my home directory in list and cover flow view modes. Other columns are okay but name column does not not have a title and it is empty.  I am using Mac OS X 10.9.5.  How can I make it show file/directory names properly in all view modes?  <comment192842> Sorry, I am confused, your home directory (the one with home icon) should only show folders (names) it will not show files. <comment192843> If you are sure that you're viewing your Home directory when this happens, try closing all Finder windows, open Terminal and issue `cd ~`, press the Enter key, then `rm .DS_Store`, Enter key again. Open a new Finder window and select your Home directory; does it properly display now? <comment192964> Buscar, it does not show names of folders and files. But when I click on one of them, finder goes into that directory. <comment192965> After I did what dougro said in the comment above, problem was not solved. After that, I changed my default directory from home to somewhere else, then I manually went to home directory, problem was still not solved.   Finally I clicked on the title of the name column and suddenly names are shown again... This is a strange behaviour, but problem seems gone now.
