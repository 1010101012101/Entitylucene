Lion login screen when using two screens <body> When logging into Lion with a second screen attached, does the second screen always have a plain grey background as opposed to the textured background that the primary screen has?  Is there a way to change the login wallpaper on only the second screen?  <answer24822> I believe the answer is "no". You can select a custom desktop picture for Lion, but I know of no way to select different pictures for each screen.  <comment27934> But actually I don't even ask for a different one for the other screen: the default texture would be fine. That's really strange Lion is so bad with two screens...
