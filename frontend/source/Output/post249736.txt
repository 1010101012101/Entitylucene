How can I move videos back into the Camera Roll? <body> Every so often I move all the pictures and videos off my phone onto my desktop in order to free space on the phone. I have this app called 1 Second Every Day which uses video clips from my Camera Roll to build longer videos.  I moved all my pictures and videos off of my roll before realizing I'd need them to make this month's video. Is there a way I can restore videos taken with the phone back onto the Camera Roll?  I'm running Windows 10 with iTunes 12.3.12.25.  <answer249998> Turns out you can bring them back into your Camera Roll, or at least in a place where you can use them in 1SE, just by copying them into Dropbox.  ol liCopy your MOV files into Dropbox./li liInstall the Dropbox app on your device./li liFor each video, select the ellipsis icon and then Export, then Save Video./li /ol  <comment310025> You can sync them back, but they won't be on the camera roll.
