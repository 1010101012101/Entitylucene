Cannot add gmail account to iOS <body> I just had a major hack and had to change password.  Apple mail will not accept my new password with Gmail, so I cannot add that mail account.  <answer169554> As was suggested to you in the comments, you will need to provide more information in order to get some relevant help  Generally speaking the steps to follow are:  ol liChange your password and write it somewhere. I suggest using a password manager./li liLogin to your google account from your phone with the new password./li liStep 2 being a success mean that you indeed changed the password to the one you thing you did./li liAdd the account in the iOS Mail app and write again the same password carefully in order to avoid any typos./li /ol  If 4 failed, it means that you have 2nd factor authentication enabled for you google account.  This means that you will need to stronggenerate an application specific password/strong from here and use that as your email password in the iOS Mail app.  <comment199187> Which exact steps are you doing, where does it fail and with which message? Do you have two factor authentication enabled for Gmail?
