OS X 10.11.1 with Safari 9.0.1 freezes on opening new tab or address bar selection <body> I've got MBPro Mid 2014 with the latest OS X update - 10.11.1.   I have noticed that sometimes Safari freezes for 3-5 seconds when I open new tab or click on address bar. I am sure that I didn't have this issues few days ago.

Did anyone stumble across this problem?   <answer222320> I can't reproduce this issue. I guess it's related to incompatible Safari Extensions. Try disable them one by one.
