Shortcut to apply header style 4 (and 5, 6...) <body> In Microsoft Office Word, one press kbd⌘⌥1/kbd, kbd⌘⌥2/kbd or kbd⌘⌥1/kbd to apply header style 1, 2 or 3 respectively. This is also documented by Microsoft (see: Aligning and formatting paragraphs). However writing a large document, I want to apply header style 4 (and 5, 6...) but there does not seem to be a shortcut available for that. Applying header styles is not an option in the menu bar, so I cannot create a custom shortcut through codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code (I suppose). How would I add a shortcut in this case?  <answer40329> Found it, although I did not expect the solution to be this simple. To do this, follow these steps:  ol liRight-click the Heading 4 style in the ribbon and choose 'Modify' (Or through Layout  Styles  Heading 4  Modify/li liIn the left hand bottom corner, select 'Shortcut'/li liAssign shortcut kbd⌘⌥4/kbd/li liRepeat for Heading 5, 6.../li liDone!/li /ol
