Do iPad Mini 2s require special headphones <body> When watching Utube Rugby on my new iPad Mini 2 the sound is fine but as soon as I plug in headphones I have to turn the sound controls up to maximum and even then it's still too soft.  <comment337053> Sounds like your headphones might be at fault. Do they work well with other devices? If you have a case around your iPad Mini 2, make sure you are inserting the plug as fully as it will go. Remove the case for a more thorough test. <comment337074> In case it's not clear from the comment posted by @IconDaemon, no, an iPad Mini 2 does not require special headphones.
