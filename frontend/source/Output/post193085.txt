Logical Volume Group "Available Space" <body> Can anyone help explain why there is 17gb worth of free space on my LVG I can't seem to do anything with this space. Is there anyway to fix this? I have already reformatted the disk then cloned the contents back with CCC. I also have FileVault enabled.  Whenever I see this on others setups it is usually a few KB not 17gb!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwrCu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer193088> You may be [not] seeing the other partitions on the drive, Recovery &amp; EFI, which will be contributing to that 'extra' space.

There's no way the free space reported has anything to do with the extra partitions. Recovery is about 650MB for me (at least on a 128GB drive. It may be larger on larger drives. No idea.) Core Storage doesn't actually add any partitions. It requires a recovery partition, but that's the normal setup these days anyway. <comment230370> I have attached it as an image. <comment230371> I checked this earlier and the hidden partitions make up for about 1gb of space! <comment233567> Does anyone have any ideas its driving me insane!
