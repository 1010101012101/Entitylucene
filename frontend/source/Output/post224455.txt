An app that can give me the amount of time using an app? <body> I need an app that tracks automatically every time I use Final Cut X or another app and gives me the total usage time. Any ideas?  <answer224461> I use strongRescueTime/strong. It's quite cool + for free you get a lot of features   <answer224466> h2Option A/h2  Option A is to create an alias:  precodealias timeon='ps -ax -o etime,command -c | grep'  /code/pre  then you can run:  precodetimeon Safari /code/pre  h2Option B/h2  If you're comfortable with the shell you can use:  precodeps -ax -o etime,command -c /code/pre  and attempt to locate the app. For me, codeSafari/code looks like:  precode   01:57:18 Safari /code/pre  You an also pipe it through codegrep/code:  precodeps -ax -o etime,command -c | grep "Safari$" /code/pre  <comment272232> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context.
