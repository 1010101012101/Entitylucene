Applescript array of applications <body> I have a script that reload the active tab of an open browser, but I want it to do with all opened browsers. Is there a way to make a list/array and use it in this code?  This code works with one browser only:   precodeif application "Safari" is running then     tell application "Safari"         activate     end tell     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Safari"             keystroke "r" using {command down}         end tell     end tell end if /code/pre  I've tried to create an array/list but I think this is no the way because it doesn't work:  precodeset browsers to {"Google Chrome", "Firefox", "Opera", "Safari"} /code/pre  <answer54598> You generally can't substitute a list for a string and have things work without some other changes.  A good way to get around this is to use a coderepeat with variable in list/code approach. This lets you go through each item in a list and run your code with each item in the list individually.br Here's how to apply that to your code:  precodeset browsers to {"Google Chrome", "Firefox", "Opera", "Safari"}  repeat with browser in browsers     if application browser is running then         tell application browser             activate         end tell         tell application "System Events"             tell process browser                 keystroke "r" using {command down}             end tell         end tell     end if end repeat /code/pre  Everything is the same except that your code is wrapped in a coderepeat with/code block and the code"Safari"/code literal is replaced with codebrowser/code, a reference to the current browser in the list of browsers (the code will be run once for each browser in the list).  <comment62525> Aaaaaah! **repeat** that's it. Thank you. I tried array/list but didn't now how to loop it. My lazy search didn't find it.
