iTunes says app installed, but not found in iPhone. Won't uninstall from iTunes either <body> I'm trying to install my own .ipa (i'm developing an app) from iTunes (windows) into my iPhone 6 (iOS 9.2.1). It usually working with no trouble at all, until suddenly the iTunes said my app is installed, but i can't find it on my iPhone. and when i try to remove it via iTunes, it just turn into "will remove" stage. I don't know what seems to cause it.
