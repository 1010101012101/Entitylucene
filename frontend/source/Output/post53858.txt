In terminal, how to get "say" to say things "right" ? ie using custom phonetics? <body> I'd like to use "say" in the terminal to create audio files with a custom phonetic dictionary, or at the very least, say things how I think they should sound. From my understanding, this can't be accomplished through the "Voice Over Utility" configuration screen.  So to have say "speak" things correctly, I'm willing to:  ul liuse a custom phonetic dictionary or/li lichange my input text to some phonetic variant/li /ul  For example, I'd like to be able to have the word "colossians" said as I expect it, which is phonetically something like "kuh LOSH uhnz" strongwithout/strong the pauses that the spaces cause in the word.  <answer53870> The Speech Synthesis Programming Guide describes the embedded speech commands that you can use to adjust how the speech synthesis engines process your input text.  The code[[inpt PHON]]/code command enables the use of phonemes and phoneme modifiers.  For example, the following text includes a phonemic version of your chosen word  (select the text, Control-click, and select Speech  Start Speaking to hear it directly in emSafari/em):  precodeIf you don't like how I say "colossians", then perhaps you will be satisfied with "[[inpt PHON]]kUH2lAASUHnz[[inpt TEXT]]". /code/pre  This syntax is accepted by the emsay/em command in the shell and AppleScript (though you will have to modify the (above) use of single- and double-quotes to suit the string literal syntax of your chosen context).  <comment61652> You can convert English text to the phonetic representation with Repeat After Me.app. It used to be installed in /Developer/Applications/ before Xcode 4.3, but is now part of the auxiliary tools package at https://developer.apple.com/downloads/. <comment61658> It'd be nice if we could use the International Phonetic Alphabet (which is in Unicode) to do this instead of the ASCII-based version Repeat After Me uses.
