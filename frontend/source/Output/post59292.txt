How do I jump to a line number in Safari 6 Web Inspector? <body> So I'm working on some javascript and I want to set a breakpoint on the line that I'm working on. It seems reasonable that I should be able to go into the Javascript debugger and jump to that line number without having to scroll to it manually.  I have read the documentation and have tried a few logical guesses but there doesn't appear to be a keyboard shortcut to jump to a line number. I can't believe that this would have been missed. Is there a way to jump to a line number?  <comment68317> I would think so, though I can't seem to find it. Chrome has it, so I assume Safari has it. Did you try Command + L?
