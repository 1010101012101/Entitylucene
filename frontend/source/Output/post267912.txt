How to synchronize threads in Messages on Mac and iPhone? <body> I actually receive iMessages on a Mac and an iPhone, and I could say that they are correctly synchronized on strongreception/strong.  Now from time to time, as everybody I have a huge volume of old iMessages to delete. Since I don't want to make masive destruction I usually perform this task on my Mac where it is much more easy and faster. The risk of selection errors is also much lower.  For example I recently deleted a few hundreds iMassages on one thread codeAlice/code on my Mac.  And I wasen't able to find any easy way to get the same thread codeAlice/code cleaned accordingly on my iPhone.  I imagined a few seconds to make these threads scroll in parallel on my Mac and my iPhone and delete manually the one already deleted on my Mac. But after 2 minutes of this boring task I understood this can't be the intelligent way.  I searched on my preffered search engine for half an hour to find many discussions on the synchronization on strongreception/strong, but none about synchronization on strongdeletion/strong.  What is the best method to achieve this synchronization of strongdeletion/strong between Messages on a Mac and an iPhone? My purpose is to obtain a real thread synchronization between devices.  The Mac versions I am running and interested in are:  ul liYosemite/li liEl Capitan/li /ul  the iPhone ones are:  ul li9.3/li li10.2/li /ul
