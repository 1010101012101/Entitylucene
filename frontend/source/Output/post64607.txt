How to install iOS 5.1 Simulator if I’m not an iOS Developer Program member? <body> iOS 6 is finally out, and so is Xcode 4.5 that comes with the iOS 6 SDK.  Unfortunately, after upgrading to Xcode 4.5, all the previously installed SDK versions have been removed and are to be re-downloaded manually. Same goes for the CLI tools.  But the strange thing happened when I went to Preferences › Downloads › Components and hit “Install” next to iOS 5.1 Simulator. I was prompted for my Apple ID and password at me, so I typed the credentials and confirmed. It turned out I was unauthorized to download it, because I hadn’t enrolled in the iOS Developer Program. (Installing Command Line Tools went just fine, though.)  It was a serious matter to me, because I’m a front-end engineer and test my work in different browsers, including the second-latest major version of Mobile Safari.  How can this be fixed?  <answer64608> See strongXcode 4.5 and iOS 5.1 Simulator/strong for the solution to this problem:     I headed over to the downloads page for Apple Developers to get the previous version of Xcode (which is 4.4.1). Downloaded the code.dmg/code and mounted it. Right-clicked the codeXcode.app/code to “Show Package Contents.”      I quickly found what I was looking for in codeContents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/code and copied codeiPhoneSimulator5.1.sdk/code to the same location in my code/Applications/Xcode.app/code.   The full blog post has some more info.  <comment75896> Xcode will require your Apple ID in order to access certain downloads, it will usually work even if your are registered with a free account. Usually you only need to be a paid developer to access beta download tools. Do you at least have a free iOS developer account? Or did this particular dowload require you to be a paid iOS developer? <comment80730> @Tony: 1) It’s not my own blog post. 2) http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/
