OSX “Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRD)” redefine shortcut not works <body> Typically on OSX remaping of keyboard shortcuts works well.  In "Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRD)" it works well too but previous keystrokes still exist:  precodeOSX &gt; System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; App Shortcuts &gt; Add Application: "Microsoft Remote Desktop" Menu Title: "Close Connection" Keyboard Shortcut: "Alt+Shift+W" /code/pre  I can close with kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdW/kbd and also with the default kbdCmd/kbd+kbdW/kbd.   This is not OSX default behaviour so I think it is BUG.  hr  Does anybody have a solution?  <answer179538> I think it's a bug too.   As it has 2 versions of Close, both Close Connection &amp; just Close [when there's no window open] I thought adding emboth/em those as key commands would do it - but no, kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd W /kbd  still closes the connection.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UJH9h.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer283264> It's likely a bug as I can confirm that this is working in MSRD beta version. https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/5e0c144289a51fca2d3bfa39ce7f2b06/  <comment357092> Welcome to Ask Different!
