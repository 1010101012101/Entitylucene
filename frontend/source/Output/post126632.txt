OSX 10.9 - Two finger click for middle click? <body> I just got a new macbook (OSX 10.9), I used one previously (also recent OSX version) where I had 2-finger click to act as a middle click in firefox (open new tab, close tab, etc). I also had right click turned on (clicking on bottom right of the trackpad).  I downloaded BetterTouchTool, but the option for "Two Finger Click" is not there. I tried disabling Mac built-in two finger commands to get it to appear but no luck - three/four/five finger click is there, but not 2.  Any ideas?  <answer126657> BetterTouchTool does not support two finger tap/click actions. There was an experimental version a long time ago but it was implemented in a 'hacky' way and never really worked right.  BetterTouchTool does let you set up a strongTipTap to middle click/strong, so that you can press with a second finger whilst your first is down (sort of like a two finger click but with a delay) to activate a middle click:  h1img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Huum.gif" → img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOvSf.png" width="177"/h1  Alternatively, you can set up a tap/press with three fingers to middle click in BetterTouchTool. This is supported fine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tg4h4.png"  If you're really looking for a two-finger click, strongKeyRemap4MacBook/strong lets you remap right click to middle click using a private.xml such as this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Right Click to Middle Click&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;remapRightClickToMiddleClick&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       —PointingButtonToPointingButton—       PointingButton::RIGHT, PointingButton::MIDDLE     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See private.xml documentation for more information and to limit to certain apps.  <comment148415> Weird, I remember doing the two finger tap on links in firefox (I never used any other tool besides BTT). I also had right click enabled. <comment149314> @Madd0g Maybe you were doing a TipTap (see edit)? <comment149315> Do you use Macs tools to make the animated gif :) <comment149317> @Buscar [Sure do](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) <comment149352> I'm giving up, I'll try the TipTap method as an alternative. I don't want to give up the right click feature. Thanks for the hard work @grgarside. EDIT: ouch, the fingers have to be side by side for TipTap, I thought the second finger could be anywhere. <comment149364> @Madd0g Yes, the two fingers for a TipTap have to be next to each other like a normal secondary click on the trackpad.
