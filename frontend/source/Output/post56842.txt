At the command line, how can I 'arrow along' faster using words instead of chr's <body> I am at the command line and I have  code. /this/set/of/directory/this_command "parm1", "parm2", "parm3"/code  When I 'up-arrow' to recall previous lines, how can I move emalong/em the line from "word to word". Ideally a directory separator slash ("/") will also count as word demarcation.  On other OS's I can use things like codectrl-[left/right]arrow/code or codealt-[left/right]/code arrow to move "a word at a time" but I haven't yet found any keystroke combination on a mac that will let me do that.  <answer56845> As a general solution for the bash shell (Linux/Mac) : I set the Vi mode with  precode$ set -o vi /code/pre  I have set it in the global /etc/bashrc file.  That way I can navigate with the usual vi keys within a command line after hitting the ESC key.  E.g. changing into Vi mode and then by pressing 'b' I can move back a word. And since the directory seperator counts as a word seperator it would work for your example.  Typing 'w' would move to the right again by a word each time. And so on  <answer56846> In Terminal, you can use codeopt-[left/right] arrow/code to navigate word by word. Additionally, you can use codeopt+click/code to reposition the cursor.  <answer61788> If you'd prefer not to switch to vi mode, you can check “Use option as meta key” under Preferences…  Settings  emany profile/em  Keyboard. With that enabled you'll be able to hit kbdOpt+B/kbd &amp; kbdOpt+F/kbd to move backward &amp; forward a word at a time, along with a plethora of other emacs-style shortcuts.
