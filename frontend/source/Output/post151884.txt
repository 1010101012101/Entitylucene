Trying to make a portable Mac Pro. <body> Is there a third party way to use a Mac Pro as the "computer" and a laptop as the Screen, mouse, keyboard, speaker, ext?  <answer152053> It sounds like it strongmight/strong work but in taking about target display mode Apple only mentions an iMac as supported.  Target Display Mode  Though they do not specifically mention a MacBook as supported or not. It is unlikely that trying it would cause problems (or damage), but I am unsure.  <comment178955> `System preferences  Sharing  Screen Sharing` might be good enough.
