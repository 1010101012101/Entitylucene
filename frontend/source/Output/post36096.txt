How can I run a PHP script by dropping file on icon? <body> I have a php script that takes a filename as an argument. When I run it from a terminal window I type  precode./my_script.php file_to_process.txt /code/pre  It works great!  What I would like to be able to do is to have an icon on my dock that when I drop a file onto it, it would excute the php script and supply the complete path to the dropped file as an argument to that script.  Is this possible?  Can you please provide step by step instructions?  <answer36103> You need to use Automator.app  Create an Application and add a Utilities-Run Shell Script  to include your my_script.php  <answer36105> Yes, this should be possible using Automator. I haven't worked with php from the command line, so I'm unsure exactly how that works, but this is a general instruction.  ol liOpen Automator (It's in the Applications folder)./li liChoose to create an Application. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BczKW.jpg" alt="Select the Application template"/li liSelect Utilities under Library and choose Run Shell Script and drag it to the area on the right. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J0jpz.jpg" alt="Select Utilities, Run Shell Script"/li liIn the text area for the run shell script action, remove 'cat' and write the full path to the script you wish to run./li liSelect to Pass input to stdin./li liSave the Application somewhere and drag it to your dock./li liTry it out by dragging a file to it./li /ol  <answer83326> You can also do this with AppleScript.  The script below open recursively all files/folder dropped on it. For each files, execute the PHP script defined by phpScriptPath passing the file path as argument.  To create the application :  strong1. Open AppleScript Editor/strong  strong2. Paste following code:/strong  pre property phpScriptPath : "/myPHP\ Scripts/my_script.php" -- Absolute path to your PHP script  on open droppedItems     processItems(droppedItems) end open  on processItems(theItems)     repeat with theItem in theItems         if isDirectory(theItem) then             processItems(theItem)         else             do shell script phpScriptPath & " " & quoted form of (POSIX path of (theItem as alias))         end if     end repeat end processItems  -- This function comes from here : -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6872007/applescript-how-to-check-if-something-is-a-directory-or-a-file on isDirectory(someItem) -- someItem is a file reference     set filePosixPath to quoted form of (POSIX path of (someItem as alias))     set fileType to (do shell script "file -b " & filePosixPath)     if fileType ends with "directory" then return true     return false end isDirectory /pre  strong3. Set absolute path of the PHPscript/strong  Edit the first property line of the script  strong4. Export as application/strong  File menu  Export :  ul liChoose app name &amp; destination/li liSelect to export as Application/li /ul  <comment41222> I followed your directions. When I run this inside of automator, and add a finder action to "Get Specified Finder Items" it works fine. I then remove the "Get Specified Finder Items" and save it, I then try dropping a file on it and it does not work - any ideas? <comment41249> it turns out, step 5 above, should be set to STDIN, and then STDIN should be read. Instead of being the file stream, STDIN contains the file name that was dropped. <comment41255> @Scott, OK, cool, I'll change the instructions then. Glad you got it to work!
