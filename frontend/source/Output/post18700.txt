Is it legal to run Xcode on OS X Lion Server in a virtualized environment in Windows? <body> Just wondering if it's legal to run Xcode on OS X Lion Server in a virtualized environment on Windows? I know it's not for the client but I've heard that it's legal with the server. It this true?  <answer18708> Maybe if you boot Windows on authentic Apple Mac hardware?  <answer18715> No. The EULA for Mac OS X Lion Server says:     2 . Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.   A. Standard and Preinstalled Apple Software License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you obtained the Apple Software from the Mac App Store or under a volume license, maintenance or other written agreement from Apple, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to install, use and run one (1) strongcopy of the Apple Software on a single Apple-branded computer at any one time./strong For example, these standard, single-copy license terms apply to you if you obtained the Apple Software preinstalled on Apple- branded hardware.   which means you can't install it on non Apple-branded hardware (but it might be legal if you virtualize using Apple hardware on Windows)  <comment20452> IIRC Somewhere in the EULA says that it must only run on Mac hardware <comment20482> I will consider this option. Thanks! <comment20483> OS X Lion Server is just a suite of apps installed on top of the Client version, so you're bound by both EULAs.
