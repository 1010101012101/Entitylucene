How do I open the context menu from a Mac keyboard? <body> In Windows, one can hit kbdShift/kbd+kbdF10/kbd to access the "Context Menu." But a similar keyboard action doesn't seem possible on Mac. One potential application...  When I make a spelling error in a document, Lion gives me the option to correct the error by right-clicking (or ctrl-clicking, two-finger tapping, etc) on the misspelled word and bringing up the context menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cR0iG.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I open this menu from the keyboard? And is it possible to access the Context Menu from a Mac keyboard?  <answer32747> You can use Better Touch tool to set up any tap/swipe/click/key combination to the right click.  <answer32758> Close to what you've asked, is to enable spelling auto-correction via:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YJbB5.png" alt=""  and then stay with your cursor at the end of a mispelled word, so you'll get an iOS style correction-suggestion:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5slB.png" alt=""  then with down-arrow and left/right-arrows you can choose the correct word.  <answer65743> If you have "correct spelling automatically" checked and it doesn't seem to be working, it might be because you're trying it in an unsupported application. E.g., I can use the feature in TextEdit and Pages but not, e.g., FireFox or SublimeText 2 (two of my most used apps).   Tho I've spent way too much time looking, I haven't found any way of getting the suggested spellings from the context menu with the keys alone.  The best option I've found so far is to use my thumb on the track pad to position the mouse and then hold codectl/code and tap (again with the thumb). It takes a bit longer because of the need for positioning, but at least I can keep my fingers on the home row.   I find it awkward to reach the codectl/code button, so I've used KeyRemap4MacBook (which is generally awesome and free) to customize the layout to make codecaps lock/code be codectl/code.  KeyRemap will also let you assign codectl + click/code to button combinations, so you don't have to tap/click.  <answer101300> The context menu can primarily be opened by a right mouse click only. But in the Universal Acces settings in the System Preferences we can control mouse keys by using the keyboard number pad. When activated, a right mouse click then can be achieved by kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd5/kbd on a keyboard with a numpad or kbdFn/kbd+kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdi/kbd on a laptop. This will allow you to 'right-click' your word.  Go to System Preference -- Universal Access -- Mouse -- Enable Mouse Keys (ON) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9gNQa.png" alt="Go to System Preference --&gt; Universal Access --&gt; Mouse --&gt; Enable Mouse Keys (ON)"  Found on: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11238186/1919382  <answer123935> @emmby  Whenever I see this question in the Internet or I ask it to someone .. people always misunderstand. Maybe because they are not Windows users, or they are Windows users who don't use the keyboard short-cuts.   I always have the same question but I didn't find the answer yet.  In windows, when we use the keyboard short-cuts we mostly use the strongMenu/strong key in Windows keyboard(see this image):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfgaL.jpg" alt="The Menu Key in Windows keyboard" &lt;== this is the strongMenu/strong key  When this strongMenu/strong key is pressed, OS will assume that you right-clicked the highlighted/active element  then it will show you the context menu even if the mouse pointer is not pointing to the highlighted element.  So this feature seems to be missing in Mac OS. And whatever suggested solutions, even strongEnable Mouse Key/strong it always require you to point/move your mouse pointer to element first, which is meaningless. If I need to use the keyboard short-cut to open the context menu on the highlighted item, why do I need again to move the mouse pointer to it also  &lt;== excuse me .. this is not a short-cut!!  <answer127895> Try press [fn]+[SHIFT]+[F10]  To me it seems that most windows on mac F-keys can be called this way.  Cheers!  <answer143128> I feel your pain.....Best work around I've found is on cnet.  Haven't tried it yet but I plan to.  Unlike a true contextual menu, this does require you look to the top-left for the commands you seek, but may still suffice to bring you the functionality you are looking for. http://www.cnet.com/news/access-menus-via-the-keyboard-in-os-x/  <answer187122> strongALMOST SOLVED/strong  I got this solution to work in some Applications (like Finder, TextEdit, Firefox, ...) but not others (like Outlook, Chrome, ... )  A 'context click' can be mapped to a key/key-combo using all native Mac OS X features (thanks to its NeXT/OPENSTEP heritage).  However, the solution is pretty technical "under the cover" stuff, and it may take some trial-and-error to get it to work.  Read about Key Bindings here, and follow (some) of the instructions to create your own  em~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/em file.  emKey Bindings/em map keys (or key-combinations) to "Responders" inside the Text System. I found the Responder for emrightMouseDown/em here, and found the "magic string" for my desired target key (F13) from this url:  emosxnotes.net/keybindings.html/em  My em~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/em looks like this  precode{     /* Context Menu */     "^\Uf710" = "rightMouseDown:";  /* Ctrl-F13 */     "^;" = "rightMouseDown:";       /* Ctrl-; */ } /code/pre  Now I emshould/em be able to hit either emCtrl-F13/em  or emCtrl-;/em to get the context menu.  NOTE: You will have to quit &amp; relaunch an Application to have it pick-up changes.  (Worked for TextEdit in 10.10)  Otherwise, log-out &amp; log-back in.  <answer205964> To bring up the spell check use codecmd + :/code.   <answer250242> For spellchek(and more) I'm use popClip + alfred workflow Ppay   <answer253933> kbdCmd-shift-:/kbd Opens "Spelling &amp; Grammar" on Chrome for me with El Capitan.  It's a clunky bodge but I can now spell check.  <answer253971> I use Alfred with RightClick workflow.  I mapped Option+CMD+Enter to trigger a right click in the frontmost application.  RightClick used to work only in Finder but it was improved to work in most applications.  <answer262552> Here is my solution on Github. This is a little AppleScript that I wrote making a control-click that you can assign to key of your choice using a shortcut utility app of your choice.  <comment37442> But it will just perform a secondary click at the current coordinates of the cursor, not show the context menu for a selection made with the keyboard. <comment37455> strangely, i have that enabled, but can't get the iOS menu to pop up <comment37464> You are right, there are options to call a url or script with the selected text, and I bet you can convince the developer to add this feature as well. <comment37482> @emmby It's not working for some apps, like Google Chrome.. <comment77365> In Firefox, control-space opens the context menu -- but curiously, it doesn't include the spelling options when invoked this way! <comment137794> While this does work, it opens the context menu at your mouse cursor and not your text cursor. <comment137819> @Uri, what you say is correct. But when you type, the mouse cursor disappears and the menu opens at the text cursor. <comment137888> Hmm, it doesn't seem to work for me. The mouse cursor just reappears at its last location. I've settle on just using the spell check shortcuts to solve this problem (`cmd + :`) <comment149878> this does not work for me <comment168567> Please don't just post links to articles elsewhere on the internet.  This does not constitute a good answer.  Please review the answer guidelines here: http://apple.stackexchange.com//help/how-to-answer <comment178309> Yes, i do use Mac  .. but Os/x SUCKS in this sense. As well as difficult access to Menu items, menu items not auto-expanding, and Mnemonics acting haphazardly if at all.  OS/X just sucks for keyboardists.  And worse - the OS/X designers are cavalier about it - so this will not get fixed. <comment222991> not working for me either... <comment262432> works on mac os x el capitan <comment272634> not working for me <comment311165> What is this supposed to do? <comment311166> Trying it out now. Even if it does not work this was interesting info.  Will comment again on whether it works for me in Finder. <comment311168> Unfortunately does not seem to work. Tried it in TextEdit on El Capitan. <comment311175> What about an external keyboard - that does not have the fn key? <comment311211> Ctrl 5, as it says in my answer <comment316964> I have (and looooooove) Better Touch Tool, and the developer is a freakin' magician.  But for this particular use case, I [use Alfred](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/254595/151730), which is my only other indispensable Mac application, right after BTT. <comment316965> Or just use the [File Actions feature](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/254595/151730), which is built into Alfred directly rather than requiring an extra workflow install.  Either way you'll need to purchase the Powerpack. <comment316974> @Wildcard. It's different than file action feature. RightClick is a global shortcut that triggers a rightclick in the current application through applescript. File action feature requires you to open the search bar, search for a file then choose a file action. <comment363705> Mac users must only be able bodied <comment364195> For example I want to access context menu `Compress file` functionality. I know it's in the menu when I right click on that file.
