change my apple id country <body> In my apple account there is $0.15. When ever I try to change my country it says "you have store credit balance; you must spend your balance before you can change stores."  If there is a way to change countries please share your info.  <comment102732> Aside from spending the money or contacting store support to have them write off that small balance?
