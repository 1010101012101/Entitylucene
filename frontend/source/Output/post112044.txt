Can I configure a task to run while my MacBook lid is closed? <body> Can I use codepmset/code or a utility like Power Manager to have a task (such as an arbitrary script or backup) run at a specific time while my Mavericks MacBook Pro's lid is closed? Are there perhaps codepmset/code settings I need to change to make such a thing work?  <answer112413> While the lid is closed, a codepmset wake/code will only wake up your machine very briefly, after which it will go back to sleep again. To keep the machine awake long enough to preform a task, you can codecaffeinate/code the machine for the amount of time (in seconds) you expect the task to take. For example, to keep the machine awake for 2 minutes, simply add  precodecaffeinate -t 120 &amp; /code/pre  early on in the script that runs your task.  Alternatively, codecaffeinate/code has options for tying the duration of the forced wake period to the completion of the task, but this runs the risk of keeping the machine awake indefinitely, so a safer bet is this expected-time-based approach.  <comment131633> does [Power Nap](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5394) not do what you want? (you mentioned only backup which it does do) <comment131634> @BradAllred: I thought PowerNap only did the Apple things listed, not tasks users can add. <comment131635> correct, but you only mentioned backup so I thought i'd mention it. <comment131637> @BradAllred: Ah, yes. I mean non-Apple backup software, for example.
