Seeking in ios youtube app <body> ios youtube app cannot seek by clicking on the seekbar. You need to find the current location and grab the red dot before you can move it. That's annoying and makes seeking a huge chore. Is there a client that doesn't have this problem but still has all the other features of youtube (like recommendations etc)?  <comment370904> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a hardware/software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request.
