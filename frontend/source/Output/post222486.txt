Can't Set Desktop Background in Fullscreen App <body> I have an 11" Air so I usually run all of my open applications in fullscreen mode. I have a codelaunchd/code job for my user that runs a script every hour and every login to set the desktop background according to time of day. The problem is that, despite running in the background, unless I am logging in or idling on the Desktop "space", it will not get set.  Weirdly, it also changes to dark mode at night (or light mode during daytime) and that part of the script works just fine.  So, if I go to my fullscreen'd codeTerminal.app/code and run the following lines, they do not work to change the desktop background:  precodeosascript -e "tell application \"Finder\" to set destop picture to POSIX file \"&lt;path&gt;\"" /code/pre  or  precodeosascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to set picture of every desktop to \"&lt;path&gt;\"" /code/pre  or even  precodetell application "System Events"     set desktopCount to count of desktops     repeat with desktopNumber from 1 to desktopCount         tell desktop desktopNumber             set picture to "&lt;path&gt;"         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Does anyone know how to get this to work?  <answer236502> I'm late to the party, but this should work for you:  precode-- Set user_project_path to the folder that contains this AppleScript set user_project_path to POSIX path of ((path to me as string) &amp; "::")  -- Assuming your images are contained in user_project_path directory inside an images folder set images_directory to user_project_path &amp; "images/" as string  tell application "System Events"   set desktopCount to count of desktops   repeat with desktopNumber from 1 to desktopCount     tell desktop desktopNumber         -- Change my-desktop-image.png below to the name with extension of your desired image         set picture to images_directory &amp; "my-desktop-image.png"     end tell   end repeat end tell /code/pre  If you have questions, let me know   <comment291592> Thanks, and I haven't tried this just yet, but how is this different from the last code block I had written in my question? <comment291651> The way I generate the path string looked a little different than yours. There's actually no way to manipulate the desktop backgrounds of "background desktops" (desktops that are not currently shown on screen) without utilizing accessibility features within the OS. <comment301850> Do you have an example utilizing said features? I would be very interested in knowing how to do that. <comment302069> @chrissphinx I haven't tried this method, but here's a simple example: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5670099?tstart=0
