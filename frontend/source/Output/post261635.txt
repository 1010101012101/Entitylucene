Reset App Permissions <body> I have an app which asks for Contacts permissions each time I launch it, even though I have already accepted it. I think it's because some fudging I did with the app bundle resulted in a non-matching app signature?  Anyways, I'd like to reset or recreate the app permissions db (it surely is a SQLite file somewhere) so maybe it solves my problem. I'm on macOS Sierra 10.12.1.  strongTo clarify:/strong I'm not asking for help regarding emdisk or folder permissions/em (read, write, execute), but emapp permissions/em (contacts, location, calendars...).  Thanks!  <comment327671> Have you taken a look inside System Preferences  Privacy  Contacts to see if the application is checked? <comment327719> The application is there and is checked, but it asks for the permission on each launch nonetheless.
