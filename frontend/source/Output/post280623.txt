I can only reproduce it for one of my apps. It seems to be some bug on Apple's part, and I have reported it, but no answer until now :-\  <answer280667> There might be a problem with iTunes Connect.  I just got an email from Apple about upcoming maintenance:      On strongApril 22, beginning at 7:00 a.m. (PDT)/strong, iTunes Connect and related content delivery services will be unavailable for up to eight hours.
