iPhone app to edit text files <body> I need to edit some local text files on my iPhone but so far, all the apps I have downloaded do not navigate the OS3 file tree for me to load and edit them.  I need to do this on my iPhone as I can no longer access it via ssh or with the iPhone cable. One of the files I want to edit is an ssh config file which is what is not allowing ssh connections.  Any ideas on apps or other methods that I could use?  <answer5821> You can do this with iFile.  This application will let you browse the local file system.br Locate your config file, then open it using the built-in emText Viewer/embr (it also has viewers/players for other file formats such as PDF or MP3).  Despite the name the emText Viewer/em will actually let you edit and save the file.  <comment5826> Load up Dropbox with your text files and download their iPhone app. <comment5831> Based on your question, I added the `[jailbreak]` tag. If that's incorrect, please remove it (or let me know if I need to). <comment6040> the link is broken <comment6041> Sorry, I have no idea why the link doesn't work. You will have to click the link, then use the menu to navigate to Applications  iFile
