Pages ’09: How to write Nested SUM? <body> I'm setting up a basic time registration form for declarable hours spent on a project. The layout is easy: emdate — time from — time until — description/em. I want a cell-value to contain the sum of hours worked on a project (time until - time from).  I would say the correct formula would be code=SOM(SOM(D9-C9):SOM(D40-C40))/code (I'm using the Dutch version). But this isn't working. My registration starts from row 9.  <answer66709> Figured it out.. code:/code must be code;/code. My mistake..
