Printer Deployment/Management <body> I have 13 macs (minis and iMacs) of a few generations, all running 10.11 or 10.12 that I'd like to find a saner way of managing printers for.    The main issue is that we have 3 different types of paper that need to be printed onto from a brother HL5470.  We set it up this way Tray 1= special label paper Tray 2= regular paper Manual Feed= colored paper  Then, what I do is create 3 instances of that printer in the printers control panel, enable CUPS, and then modify the printer settings to force those different printers to just use the correct paper feed and no other paper feed.  This works, but whenever I have to setup a new computer, or replace a printer, or with any major OS update, it all needs to be resetup.  I'm looking for other options for managing this more easily.  Would setting these up on an OSX server and sharing those printers make any part of this easier?  Is there a way to script the deployment/management of these printers?
