What is the best torrent client for OSX? <body> What is the best torrent client for OSX ?  utorrent, Transmission, Vuze or ....   ?  <answer95044> Transmission is light and captures the OS X essence. I have been using it for years with no issues. Plus, it's free and open source.  <answer95045> My vote goes to Deluge, used it for years on Linux and now on OSX. Choose it because it was similar to utorrent.  If you want minimal and effective go with Transmission.  I used Vuze many years ago, it was named Azureus then, it was written in java and very slow and unresponsive, I believe that has changed now.  <comment111446> I'm using utorrent and it's also light and works very well but I want to try transmission because it "captures the OS X essence" then I'll decide. <comment111447> Why don't you use Transmission? <comment111450> I have no idea, I like it better, but old habits die hard and I keep getting back to Deluge :) There will be a day when I just delete Deluge and stick to Transmission :D <comment111457> Define "best". What are you looking for in a torrent client? <comment111508> I just want your opinions like Melwan's opinion. <comment111555> I concur : transmission is light and efficient to manage all your torrents. It's free, open-source you can't go wrong giving it a try. <comment111664> @ammarx Other options that may interest you include http://www.xtorrentp2p.com/ and http://www.qbittorrent.org/ <comment132806> I like Xtorrent. <comment168194> Transmission's development is a nightmare. For years, Transmission supported Proxies, but one day the developers decided to spontaneously remove support for Proxies without any public discussion. That was 4 years ago and after a lot of outcry Transmission still does not have Proxy support. If your ISP throttles BT traffic (and more and more are these days) then you absolutely need a Proxy, so in that case, Transmission will not be a good choice.
