How can I keep System Events from deactivating? <body> I'm using more and more Applescripts for home automation that rely on System Events being active.  The problem is that System Events shuts down if it hasn't been used for a while.  I'm not sure how long the time is though.  15 min?  5 min?  Regardless...  if System Events isn't active, there's either a pause or an error while it launches, meanwhile I wonder what happened.  I don't want to build delays into the Applescripts because many of them are for remote control type actions (imagine if your TV required a 10 second delay every time you tried to use your remote.  That'd be annoying).  Is there a way to keep System Events active?  Is there a reason to NOT keep System Events active?  I'm on Mavericks, if that matters.  <answer110743> Save this plist as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/systemevents.plist/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;systemevents&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/System/Library/CoreServices/System Events.app/Contents/MacOS/System Events&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Then run codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/systemevents.plist/code.  It doesn't fix the glitches in the QuickHue script though. I was probably wrong when I said that the error was caused by System Events not being open.
