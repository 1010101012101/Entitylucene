How do I tell if a device is doing USB 3.0 and not downgraded to USB 2.0 for some reason? <body> For example, if I plug a USB 3.0 device and find that the I/O performance is rather slow, how do I check whether it's because the device is actually doing USB 2.0 (even though I'm using a USB 3.0 cable, connected to a USB 3.0 port on my MacBook Pro).  <answer198655> Try ï£¿ menu   About this Mac  System Report...    Select USB on the left, then find your device in the list.  The reported speed ought to be a giveaway. Mine shows it's only running at USB2 speeds [but that's because I don't have a USB3 machine]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCrgv.png" alt="enter image description here"
