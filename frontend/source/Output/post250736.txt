Pages: "Spelling and grammar" option disappeared <body> I am writing a document in French and I can't change the spelling language from English to French. I usually manage to do that (Edit  Spelling and grammar), but it isn't working this time around: The "spelling and grammar" option seems to have been replaced with "spelling", and when I click on "spelling" the window that opens up doesn't allow me to change the language. It only allows me to specify whether I want to check the spelling in the entire document or in the main text body. I hope you can help.  <answer250739> Start up Pages on its own and create a new blank document and then go to the Edit menu and see if it is correct, with Spelling and Grammar.  If so, try going to Pages  File  Open and see if your French doc also can be opened and works right.
