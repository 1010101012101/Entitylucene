Expand Sending Email with Applescript <body> I read with interest the article regarding sending an email based upon parsing through a csv file to pick up the name and email address. This looks like most of what I need to accomplish my objective with the exception that I would like for the script to run once daily and send the email one day before a date stored in the csv file. This is to remind someone that they need to perform a a certain task the next day. Emails will be sent using Apple Mail as the MTA through my gmail account.  The csv will contain the following:  firstname, lastname, action date  The script would need to pick up the first name and date from the csv file. I have coded the email text into the script as shown in the previous example.  Pseudocode:  ol liScript runs just after midnight every day parsing the csv to determine who should receive the email on what date./li liFor the selected names, create and send an email the day prior to the required action./li liAs a bonus, the script could resend the reminder on the due date as well as any new reminders for the following day./li /ol  I suppose I could manually subtract one day in my csv to make the coding easier.  I am just getting started with Applescript, and do not know how to modify the existing script to accomplish this objective.  <answer96257> Try something like this:  precodeset csv to "name@example.com,7/14 name2@example.com,7/15" --set csv to read "/Users/username/Documents/file.csv" as «class utf8»  set text item delimiters to "," set y to year of (current date) repeat with l in paragraphs of csv     set d to (date (text item 2 of l &amp; "/" &amp; y))     if date string of (current date) is date string of (d - 1 * days) then         tell application "Mail"             tell (make new outgoing message)                 set subject to "subject"                 set content to "content"                 make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:text item 1 of l}                 send             end tell         end tell     end if end repeat /code/pre  You can run the script every day after midnight (if the computer is awake) by running codeEDITOR=nano crontab -e/code and adding a line like code1 0 * * * osascript ~/Scripts/some\ script.scpt/code.  The recognized date formats depend on the settings selected in System Preferences. I don't know how to get an email address for a first name and last name.  <comment113015> You understand that this approach is quite fragile? If you Mac is off (maybe asleep, no wifi, no internet) it doesn't do a thing. In general (depending on the case) you want something more fail-safe, like running on a dedicated on a server. <comment113138> Thanks for the speedy answer. I am aware of the potential sleep problem. That said, my Mac Pro never sleeps, only my display so that shouldn't be a problem. I am familiar with cron from Linux/Unix. I believe this code, when integrated with what I already have, should do the trick as the other code parses the csv for the name and a personalized greeting. At most, I need only send a maximum of 6 emails each day so resource consumption should be light.
