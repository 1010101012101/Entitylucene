Run a script on Outlook 2016 startup <body> I'd like to run a script on startup of Outlook 2016, so it runs as one of the first actions once Outlook is open.  One example of this would be to automatically switch to a certain view on every start, something that isn't possible using Outlook's preferences.  I don't see an "app startup" trigger in Automator, but maybe I've missed something. Is there a way to do this generally?  <answer267291> h2One approach would be to write an applescript to load Outlook and then execute the script./h2  Copy the following to a new script using Script Editor in codeApplications/Utilities/code  precodeuse AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later use scripting additions  on run     tell application "Microsoft Outlook"         activate          -- now tell Outlook to do other stuff     end tell      -- if you have another script already written that you want to run, then     set theScript to ("path:to:script.scpt") as alias     run script theScript      -- or if your script takes arguments like the this:     --on MsgBox(Msg)     --  display dialog Msg     --end     set theScript to load script file ("path:to:script.scpt")     tell theScript         MsgBox("Hello World!")     end tell end run /code/pre  You can save the applescript as a applet (Save As - select "Application" for type), rename it to Outlook 2016 and change its icon to match the Outlook 2016 icon and leave it on your dock in place of Outlook itself.  The downside is that, when Outlook is running, you'll have both the Outlook dock item and the applet on your dock, but that's a small price to pay.  h2Another approach is to make a silent program that checks to see if Outlook is running or not./h2  When the running status of Outlook changes from false to true, it will run a script. This involves making an applescript applet that will run at startup, stay open all the time, and be hidden from the dock. It will consume very little resources, but it's still a price to have it running all the time.  precodeuse AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later use scripting additions --  Need to save with "Stay Open" option  property CheckTimeSeconds : 60 --   controls the number of seconds between each check to see fi Outlook is running  property WasRunning property IsRunning  on run     set WasRunning to false     set IsRunning to false     return end run  on idle     set IsRunning to appisrunning("Microsoft Outlook")      if IsRunning and not WasRunning then -- Outlook has been opened in the last CheckTimeSeconds seconds.         --run script here     end if      set WasRunning to IsRunning      return CheckTimeSeconds end idle  on appisrunning(appName)     tell application "System Events" to (name of processes) contains appName end appisrunning /code/pre  ol liSave as an application with the "Stay open after run handler" option selected/li liSet the program to have no dock icon/li liLoad the program at login for your user (drag your application into the list at System Preferences - Users &amp; Groups - Login Items)/li /ol  If you want to close this program, you'll have to do so manually from Activity Monitor.  <comment335327> Thanks for the info but we could go without the comment and sarcasm.
