Skype hangs since upgrading to Mavericks <body> Since upgrading to Mavericks the latest version of the Skype app (6.9 rev 701) hangs frequently, pretty much every time on wake after the laptop goes to sleep.  I've heard some suggestions about downgrading to an earlier version in the 6 series, any decent workaround for this problem?  <comment127491> Here are the related discussions on Skype forums: http://community.skype.com/t5/Mac/Skype-issues-on-Mavericks-OSX-10-9/td-p/2045773 <comment127499> hehe, thanks, seems there are no good options except to wait for a fix, this post pretty much sums it up http://community.skype.com/t5/Mac/Skype-issues-on-Mavericks-OSX-10-9/m-p/2058075/highlight/true#M60429
