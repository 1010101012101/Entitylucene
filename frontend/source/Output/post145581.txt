Desktop folder behaving abnormally <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vK6gY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Of late, my Desktop (and the desktop folder in Finder) behave oddly. Everytime I click on Desktop in Finder, it opens TextWrangler. Right clicking on the desktop also shows a different menu than before.  Digging deeper I realised the desktop folder's properties are not the same as documents folder or other folders.   Looking at the attached screenshot, you will see what I mean.  How can I restore it back to normalcy?  https://www.dropbox.com/s/n65wvny0tf047aj/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-17%20at%205.33.02%20pm.png?dl=0  <comment171593> What is the output of Terminal command `ls -l ~/Desktop` ? <comment171602> total 0 drwxr-xr-x+ 12 sajid  staff  408  1 Aug 19:26 New Folder
