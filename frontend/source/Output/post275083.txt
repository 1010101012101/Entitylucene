How to open google sheets cell with numeric keypad on IOs? <body> I read in another blog post it's possible to edit a Google Sheets cell in iOS with the numeric keypad open by default:     Tap a cell with only numbers in it, Sheets will open the numeric keypad so you donâ€™t have to make another tap to switch to it.   But this functionality isn't working, only my regular keyboard pops up. Am I missing something? How do I get the numeric keypad to pop up?
