Restore iMessage conversation to iOS from OS X <body> I recently discovered on my Mac that I had a very old conversation saved between me and a friend. It was accidentally deleted off my phone many months ago, but now that I found it saved on Messages on my Mac, I would like to get it back on my phone.br I'd prefer to either have it as one long picture, or as a regular conversation, which I would love.  I am trying to transfer to my iPhone 5s.
