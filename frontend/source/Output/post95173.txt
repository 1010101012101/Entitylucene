How do I use Freenode IRC with SASL in Adium? <body> I received the following error when trying to join Freenode with Adium:  code*** Notice -- You need to identify via SASL to use this server/code  I understand why they want me to use SASL in my case, and I can see this is a common problem. I can see that Adium supports SASL, and I can find the help ticket that prompted the Adium dev group to add SASL support.  What I can't find is... how to use SASL in Adium. I don't see any options for enabling SASL or configuring it or anything. Thanks for your help.  <answer95208> Adium 1.5 doesn't support using SASL for IRC. That will be added in 1.6: https://trac.adium.im/ticket/14478.  In 1.6, there will be a checkbox to activate SASL. When that is activated, the password field is treated as the SASL password.  h2The following build can be used successfully: Adium_1.6hgr5915.dmg/h2  And this guide may help if you have question using it after you've enabled SASL.  <comment111621> Is there an option for something like a NickServ password? <comment111625> There are two username/password options: one for the IRC server and one for the proxy. I have entered a pw for the IRC server, but I haven't registered yet. I have to connect, first. <comment111626> Oh. You'll need to register to use SASL, I think. <comment111628> OK, I've registered but I'm getting the same error. <comment164704> What can be used on mac? <comment237114> This build works great: http://nightly.adium.im/adium-adium-1.6/Adium_1.6hgr5915.dmg <comment370380> Looks like the Adium website has been broken for several weeks
