Numbers Bubble Chart Bubble Radius <body> I can't figure out how to change the radii of the bubbles in a bubble chart in Numbers. I tried taking the original data and dividing it by 10, or 100, and redirecting the codeSize:/code data to the new column, but the bubble size hasn't changed.  I'm finding Numbers to be frustratingly counterintuitive, and haven't found any mention of this yet on the Numbers Help Page.  <comment374464> Without revealing your actual data, do you have an example of what you mean to do?  How is your data structured? <comment374476> You can make your bubbles smaller by adding another data value (i.e. a set of x, y, and size values) in which your x and y values are blank and your size value is larger than all other size values.
