Not able to extract any .gz or .tar file (Mac OS X 10.5.8) <body> I have Mac OS X 10.5.8. I am not able to extract code.tar/code or code.tgz/code files with any of the extractor utilities (Mac OS Default Archiver or WinZip or 7zip or any other, I have tried almost all possible).   Each of them give same error:     "Unable to unarchive. (Error 32 - Broken pipe.)"   There is no problem with archived files, I can extract each of them when I use same extractors on Windows.  Would someone please help me with this?  <answer42502> Does it work from a terminal for tgz files? Open a terminal and cd to the folder that has the files and try something like this:  precodetar xvzf file.tar.gz /code/pre  Or for plain tar files:  precodetar xvf file.tar /code/pre  <answer43119> There may be too many NUL blocks at the end of the tar file, so that the codetar/code command prematurely finishes its executions (and closes its standard input) after having received two NUL blocks while the codegunzip/code command is still trying to write to the pipe that now has no reader anymore (which raises an codeEPIPE/codeerror message with error number 32 for a broken pipe; for more information see: Tar-filled pipes).  According to the output of newproc.d codeArchive Utility.app/code seems to use the following commands (Mac OS X uses codebsdtar/code by default):  precode/usr/bin/gunzip -c file.tar.gz | /usr/bin/tar xf - -C dir /code/pre  To see the number of trailing NUL blocks in the tar file use:  precodegnutar -tzf file.tar.gz -i --block-number | nl | tail -n 25 /code/pre  To extract the tar archive try:  precode# -i: ignore blocks of zeros in archive (normally mean EOF) gnutar -i -xvf file.tar.gz /code/pre  code.zip/code files can be tested with:  precodeunzip -lv file.zip unzip -t file.zip /code/pre  <answer96006> check the directory and the path, the scipt may lead you to users/download/folders/blah    but you keep it on users/favourite/folder/blah (example) thats make the error.   <comment48319> I usually face the same problem and go back to terminal to extract the archives. I get this even with zipped files. <comment112723> Could you clarify that a bit?
