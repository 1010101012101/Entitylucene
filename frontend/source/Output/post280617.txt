Safari 10.1: unable to install extension from Apple's official Gallery <body> On Safari Extension Gallery page the "Install Now" button does not appear after updated to Sierra 10.12.4. It seems that Apple's official webpage didn't recognize that I'm using Safari 10.1 (12603.1.30.0.34).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O67EA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I searched the community and found lots of discussions of similar issue, but it seems there is no magic cure for everyone. Here is what I've done so far:  ol liI can still install and activate 3rd party Extensions directly from .safariextz file. So the "Verisign Certificate" thing is not the cause of this problem. And that strong"Trust" button works as expected/strong with normal mouse click (no need to enable Keyboard navigation or something)./li liAntivirus / CleanMyMac / MacKeeper / other 3rd. party in system proxy or firewall: strongNOT INSTALLED/strong in the first place./li liLog in with Guest account: strongNOT WORKING/strong. Safari Extension Gallery still won't recognize me./li liReboot into Safe mode: strongNOT WORKING/strong./li liFix permission with Onyx: strongNOT WORKING/strong.
