How to Instantly Lock your Mac OS X Screen, using keyboard, in Mountain Lion <body> I have a Macbook Air, and I want to know if there is a way to instantly lock my screen, using only my keyboard.  I saw that it is possible to lock it using the following shortcut: codeControl+Shift+Eject/code.  But since Macbook Air didn't have an codeEject/code key, how could I still lock my screen using a similar shortcut?
