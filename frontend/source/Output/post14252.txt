How do I display long list of client on a page using keynote <body> In keynote each page has a fixed size. Just to impress people I am developing a page which will list around 40 clients.  I want the list of client names to appear one after another and the list will scroll down.  Sort of like the reverse of a credits scroll at the end of a movie. How do I do that with Keynote?  For simplicity you can also imagine as having a single page that lists from 1 to 100 vertically.  <answer14257> I hope I unterstood what you want...  I tried to create an example: scroll_example.zip  strongFollow these steps:/strong  ol liCreate all your client names/li liGroup them all to one object (if they're all in one textbox, skip this step)/li liCreate an action for that object - Move/li liSet the action from bottom to top and specify the duration/li liPlace your object outside your slide and end position of the move action is of course in your slide (see the example) /li /ol  <answer38065> If you wanted to do side to side you could add each item as a separate text item, and then apply a Drift build-in animation. Unfortunately Drift only does left to right, or right to left. But it provides a nice organic move in and move out with acceleration and deceleration.   <comment15366> Providing an example is a good idea, I was trying to figure out how to describe what to do and passed on answering. <comment15369> Thank you so much. I did not even know that this feature existed. Really appreciate it. <comment220330> How to define the boundary for the ball movement inside the slide page? What I mean is that I don't want the ball movement from bottom of the screen to top of the screen. Instead I want to limit the movement in the area inside the screen.
