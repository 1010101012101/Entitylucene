Working with 3D software on MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch <body> I'm choosing new laptop (I'm currently on very old Mac) for working with 3D, especially with Autodesk Maya and Pixologic ZBrush. I found, that there is no support for retina right now, and I guess it looks "pixelated".  Maybe someone here have experience with Maya and ZB on retina display? Is it possible to work with it?  And, especially, how it looks on scaled 1920x1200 resolution, it still looks "pixelated", can you show some screenshots?  Thanks.
