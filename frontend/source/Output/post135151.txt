How do you restart/force quit the notification center in mavericks <body> I am referring to the upper right corner (beside spotlight). Somehow my notification center crashed while I was typing a message and it has been broken for a couple of days now. Is there a way besides restarting my machine? (just curious, i can easily restart it but if there's a way for it to go away without restarting then I'd like that)  <answer135173> Open the Activity Monitor, kill codeNotification Center/code and it'll reload automatically !  <comment160275> thanks! was looking for this in the force quit menu -_-
