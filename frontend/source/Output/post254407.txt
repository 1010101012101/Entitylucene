OSX Sierra: Mail Rules gone <body> Just went add a mail rule and it appears that the sierra upgrade has wiped all mail rules:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sc75F.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to recover them, or do I need to set them all up again? Staggers me that apple still can't get this right...
