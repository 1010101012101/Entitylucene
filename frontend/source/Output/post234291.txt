Making a FaceTime Audio call using AppleScript <body> I have read through Make a FaceTime call using AppleScript, but the provided solution is for starting a video call. I am wondering if that solution can be adapted to make a FaceTime Audio call (and by extension, maybe even a call via iPhone utilizing Continuity).  <answer243885> I found it!  I tried many different combinations, such as codefacetimeaudio://[phonenumber]/code and codefacetime://audio/[phonenumber]/code, but nothing worked. I was starting to think that there wasn't a way to do this.  However, today, I decided to take another crack at it with some different combos, and this one works: codefacetime-audio://[phonenumber]/code.  <comment350338> I also figured out how to make calls via iPhone to take advantage of the Continuity features. It uses the URL scheme `tel://[phonenumber]`.
