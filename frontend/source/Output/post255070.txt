autossh in background does not work anymore <body> Prior to my updating to macOS Sierra, codeautossh/code worked just fine. Now, when I run it the ssh session alway terminated immediately. This is the command that I use:  precodeautossh -f -M 8880 -N -y -L 8889:localhost:8888 my-server /code/pre  When I look at the log-file, I get the following output:  precode2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15328]: checking for grace period, tries = 0 2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15328]: starting ssh (count 1) 2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15328]: ssh child pid is 15329 2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15328]: check on child 15329 2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15328]: set alarm for 600 secs 2016/09/29 10:54:17 autossh[15329]: execing /usr/bin/ssh 2016/09/29 10:54:21 autossh[15328]: check on child 15329 2016/09/29 10:54:21 autossh[15328]: ssh exited with error status 255; restarting ssh /code/pre  This goes on and on. However, when I run the same command without the code-f/code option (not running in the background), everything works fine. This looks like the problem described here, but I'm not using a custom id.  What could be the cause for this, and how to fix it?  <answer255222> Since macOS Sierra, codessh-add/code doesn't automatically load keys added with codessh-add -K/code on startup. In order for this to work, I had to add codessh-add -A/code to my code.bashrc/code, now things work as expected.
