Macbook pro being slowed down ky kernal_tasks in Mavericks <body> I downloaded Mavericks when it first came out and it was no problem. Within the last week or so, my mac has become EXTREMELY slow.  Solutions I have tried: -Resetting the PRAM/NVRAM -Resetting the SMC -Backing up data with time machine and reinstalling Mavericks  Even while running a single chrome web page, I check the Activity Monitor and Kernal_Tasks is using anywhere from 76% to 1,000% cpu usage.  Here is a picture from Activity Monitor where Kernal_Tasks is using 76% cpu usage: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ustudc&amp;s=8  Here is a picture from Activity Monitor where Kernal_Tasks is using over 1,000% cpu usage: http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2zycrva&amp;s=8#.U_0kTbxdUjw  Keep in mind, these images were taken only while running a few pages in Chrome. I've searched around and a lot of people are having this problem, but there aren't really solutions going around.  EDIT: My internet is really fast, there's something wrong with my computer I think.  Please someone help me :(  Here is my EtreCheck:  EtreCheck version: 1.9.15 (52) Report generated August 26, 2014 at 4:57:26 PM PDT  Hardware Information: ?
