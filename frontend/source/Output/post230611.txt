opening two remote screen sharing on the same client <body> I have a macbook and I connect to my linux accounts with codescreen sharing/code. I would like to connect to two different linux accounts from the same client (my macbook) at the same time, using two different instances of codescreen sharing/code. Is this possible? How?  <answer230623> Just make a emNew Connection/em  For the purposes of answering this question, I have connected to two separate Macs - an XServe that I use for Dev purposes and a colleagues MacBook Pro - at the same time.  All my FreeBSD (alternative to Linux)  servers are "headless" and have no GUIs installed - everything is done via command line, so I can't show it connecting to a *nix machine GUI specifically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxW7n.jpg" alt="Two Screens"  To do this, just open a new session in Screen Sharing by clicking "New" on the Screen Sharing menu (top bar) or in Connect to Server (kbdCmd/kbdkbdK/kbd) and entering codevnc://&lt;servername or ip address&gt;/code  I haven't tested the limit, but I am sure you can add more screens as needed.
