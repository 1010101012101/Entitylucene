Connect to an UPnP Server as guest <body> I can connect to my UPnP file server (the server is my ASUS router actually) via strongConnect to Server (âŒ˜+K)/strong diagram in Finder (By the way this server don't show up in Network folder). I don't have write access on this server for huge files. I used to have write access for any size of files when it was connected as emGuest/em.   Now I'm trying to connect to server as a Guest by disconnecting or ejecting the server and reconnecting using Connect to Server but it doesn't show me anything and just connect to server as my Mac user name.  Here is Finder connected to server as my Mac user name:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQ3TY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is cemonnect to server/em diagram:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/To8jj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here is the error I'm getting when I try to write big file in server:  I'm getting this error only on big file size. Small files copying fine. This file for example was more than code8GB/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EGdFC.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can I connect to this server as Guest?/strong I know if I connect as a guest again, it will solve my problem because it used to have no problem before.  strongEnvironment Info:/strong  hr  ul liOSX: 10.7 (Lion)/li liRouter: ASUS (RT-N56U) /li liMac: MacBook Air/li /ul  <answer27066> Is there an entry for the server in Keychain Access? If so, try deleting it. That could prevent you from automatically logging in as your user name.  <comment30960> Brilliant answer!
