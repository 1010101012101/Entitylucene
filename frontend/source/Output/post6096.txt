Where's my free space gone on my MP3 player? <body> I have a Sansa Fuze MP3 player, it's 4 GB.  I plug it in my Mac I have a capacity of 3,7 GB of which apparently 1,8 GB is in use.  Problem is I only have arround 120 MB of MP3s on it...  Who's stealing my free space ?  Here are DiskInventoryX screenshots. I have the same results with du and the terminal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p6f9X.png" alt="alt text" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Mfws.png" alt="alt text"  <answer6097> The missing space is probably the operating system and other hidden system files.   <answer6101> Ok problem solved.  I repaired the disk using codeDisk Utility.app/code. Some blocks were not marked as free apparently!  <answer6102> It might also be the trash -- I'm not sure how DiskInventoryX copes with trash directories on external drives. It might be worth emptying your trash while the drive is mounted.
