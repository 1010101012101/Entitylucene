Upgrade and jailbreak 8.1 -> 8.4 <body> I have an iPhone 4s. Currently, iOS 8.1 is installed, but it isn't jailbroken. When my device is connected to iTunes, it says I can update to iOS 8.4.1.  What is the correct way to get a jailbroken version of iOS 8.4 onto my phone? Is it possible?  <answer200622> Yes, not only is it possible to upgrade and jailbreak, it's very easy.  h1Updating to iOS 8.4/h1  ol liInstall the latest version of iTunes on your computer./li liTap here to download the iOS 8.4 code.ipsw/code file (operating system)./li liPlug your device into your computer./li liIn iTunes, select your device./li liIn the Summary pane use the following on the Check for Update box.  ul liWindows: kbdShift/kbd + Click/li liMac: kbdOption/kbd + Click/li /ul/li liSelect the code.ipsw/code file and update./li /ol  h1Jailbreaking iOS 8.4/h1  ol liDownload the TaiG jailbreaking software./li liConnect your device to your computer using the USB cable./li liTemporarily Disable Passcode from Settings  Touch ID &amp; Passcode./li liTemporarily turn off Find my iPhone from Settings  iCloud  Find my iPhone./li liOn Windows, launch the jailbreaking application as an Administrator.

Now the iPhone and the iTunes offers me **8.4.1** to download. (not 8.4). The 8.4.1 as far as i known isn't possible jailbreak (it closed the Tiag's hole). So, the question is still the same: How to install get an jailbroken 8.4 to my iphone. <comment242545> @vembutech the link is useless it is for 8.1. Maybe the question isn't clear - so trying to refine it. Now the iPhone and the iTunes offers me 8.4.1 to download. (not 8.4). The 8.4.1 as far as i known isn't possible jailbreak (it closed the Tiag's hole). So, the question is still the same: How to install get an jailbroken 8.4 to my iphone. (e.g. i do not want jailbreak 8.1, but want the 8.4 - the lastest jaibreak-able iOS in my iPhone. <comment242546> Also reverted you edit, because the edit removes the details about the versions. Please, if you edit a question (it is welcomed), but *please* do not alter it's main points. <comment243992> I'm facing a similar problem, but in my case with iOS 8.1 jailbroken on a 5s.  Taig won't work as it requires at least 8.1.3 which I don't have, the legit upgrade method goes straight to 8.4.1.  Do update this thread if you find a fix.
