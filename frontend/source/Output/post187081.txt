Kali Linux on Macbook <body> I have a question about kali linux on an Apple Macbook Pro running in Parallels.br  After giving the command codesudo airmon-ng/code in terminal, it shows no interface.   Does anybody know what to do or is it not possible to successfully use kali linux in a virtual machine on a Mac?  <answer187156> codeairmon-ng/code is a part of strongAircrack-ng/strong and if you want to use the emAircrack-ng software suite/em in a VM you'll need to provide your own USB Wi-Fi Network Adapter attached directly to the VM since Parallels, VMware Fusion and VirtualBox, only provide a wired Ethernet adapter to the VM.
