how can someone take out my photos in camera roll when both find my iphone and erase iphone were activated? <body> My phone was stolen 2 months ago and now someone is trying to blackmail me by the photos i had on the phone. I had a 4digit homescreen lock password, i have activated find my iphone just after they stole it and I have also activated the erase my iphone option a couple of days later.how do they have access to my photos? Please help  <comment352268> What makes you think they are not bluffing? low digit pin can be compromised - especially if you reuse a pin or the person in possession of your device is highly motivated or has a modest budget for hardware hacking. _(so I don't want to dismiss this as probable without more details)_ <comment352282> My first thought is the same as @bmike - that they are probably just bluffing. However, do you happen to know who this _someone_ is? If they happen to know _you_, then is it likely they knew or were able to guess your 4 digit passcode from what they know of you? If you're fairly certain this person does not know you (or isn't working in cahoots with someone who does) then it's highly likely they're bluffing - especially if you've been able to erase your iPhone. <comment352305> Did you report the theft to your local police or constabulary?
