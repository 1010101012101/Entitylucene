What option should I give the sudo command to have the password asked through a graphical interface? <body> This problem has ben bugging me for a while now.  Every now and then, I need to write a script file that should execute codesudo/code commands. I do not necessarily know in advance that I will run as codesudo/code so I am sure there is a way to open a nice graphical interface (such as the one popping up when installing software) but how ?  The codeman sudo/code says:  precode-A          Normally, if sudo requires a password, it will read it from the current terminal.  If the -A (askpass) option is specified, a (possibly             graphical) helper program is executed to read the user's password and output the password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS             environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, the value specified by the askpass option in             sudoers(5) is used /code/pre  So I am pretty sure the solution resides in that code-A/code and codeSUDO_ASKPASS/code tuple however I've managed to find what to put into those.  <answer23496> OS X doesn't come with a graphical front-end for sudo but you'll find cocoasudo or macsudo helpful.  <answer23514> OS X doesn't have an entirely clean way to do this, but there are a few ways to fake it.  First, AppleScript has a good way to do sudo-ish things based on a graphical authentication, and you can use that:   precodeosascript -e "do shell script \"stufftorunasroot\" with administrator privileges" /code/pre  You can also use that mechanism to set the sudo timestamp, and then use the regular sudo (within the 5-minute timeout window) to do things:  precodeosascript -e "do shell script \"mkdir -p /var/db/sudo/$USER; touch /var/db/sudo/$USER\" with administrator privileges" &amp;&amp; \     sudo stufftorunasroot /code/pre  Finally, you can use AppleScript to prompt for a password, then pass that to sudo:  precodepw="$(osascript -e 'Tell application "System Events" to display dialog "Password:" default answer "" with hidden answer' -e 'text returned of result' 2&gt;/dev/null)" &amp;&amp; /     echo "$pw" | sudo -S stufftorunasroot /code/pre  <comment26216> In Linux these would be handled by front-ends like `gtksudo` or `kdesudo`. I don't know what there is on the OS-X side of things, but I assume you are looking for something along those lines. <comment26349> waited for so long to have that thanks for this great tip
