How can I set a keyboard shortcut to paste text? <body> I want to be able to make a keyboard shortcut system wide on a Mac that will paste some text into whatever I am selecting. For example, I am typing in notes and I press cmd + alt + k, then text that says "Hello World!" will paste into the text box. I was looking for other answers to this but couldn't find any.  <answer294871> This is not a keyboard shortcut per se but you can define letters to represent a word or phrase. I have set my email address to be represented by jj. Whenever I type that followed by a space it prints my email address. You can define as many as you like. Go to system preferences, keyboard. Click on the text tab and you can define your shortcuts.  <answer294872> If you are fine with installing 3rd party software, one feature of BetterTouchTool does what you are looking for  http://docs.bettertouchtool.net/docs/key_sequences.html  According to the creators at https://www.boastr.net/ BetterTouchTools is available as a trial version.  <answer294888> You could create this using AppleScript and run it using Automator.  Create a script:  precodetell application "System Events" to keystroke "Hello World." /code/pre  emReplace "Hello World." with your desired text, but make sure to keep the quotation marks around whatever text you input as that is what is making the data type a string./em  Next, use strongAutomator/strong to trigger the above AppleScript:  ol liOpen Automator. /li liCreate a new codeservices/code workflow. /li liSet codeService Recieves/code to codeno input/code./li liSet codein/code to codeany application/code./li liUnder "Actions" in the left pane, search for "Run AppleScript."/li liOnce you find that, drag "Run AppleScript" over to the right pane, which enters it into your workflow. /li liSave the workflow. /li /ol  Finally, use strongSystem Preferences/strong to assign this workflow to a global hotkey.   ol liOpen emSystem Preferences/em./li liClick emKeyboard/em./li liClick emKeyboard Shortcuts/em. /li liScroll down to and select emServices/em in the left pane. /li liIn the right pane, search for the name of the Automator workflow that you just saved and click on the checkbox to the left of the file name. /li liHold down your desired keyboard shortcut and it will automatically assign this workflow to your selected hotkeys. /li /ol  This is probably the easiest way of accomplishing your desired task while writing the least amount of code as possible.   There is also a tool called strongAlfred/strong that is outstanding; I use it many times on a daily basis. At this point I would probably be lost without it. It can completely take over spotlight for you (in fact I deleted the hotkey to bring up spotlight search (cmd + space) and assigned that hotkey to open Alfred instead. Within Alfred you can do things such as copy text from one place, then copy more text from somewhere else and append them together, do anything that you can do in Spotlight search, plus much, much more. The reason that I bring up Alfred is because you can create this same exact workflow within Alfred and assign it to a system wide hotkey all within the same application without writing and code at all (if you consider the example that I just gave to actually be writing code). In fact, the types of workflows you can create in Alfred is essentially limitless and there are even already built recipes online, for different applications that you can download.  <comment372142> Thanks! This worked for me! <comment372145> Would text expansion work for you? Once you select text, typing anything replaces the text and then expansion would take hhww or whatever into HelloWorld! <comment372162> To improve your answer. Maybe you can give an example how you can achieve it with AppleScript. <comment372165> @pjctech - how about getting rid of that -1 for me!  <comment372233> much better  and yes I upvoted your answer
