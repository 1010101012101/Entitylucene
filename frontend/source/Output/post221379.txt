High CPU and energy usage in Safari <body> Energy impact of Safari is extremely high on my Macbook Air Mid 2013 El Captian 10.11.2. It lead to high usage of CPU (Temperature ~65.0Â°C) and the CPU fan is running in full speed (6500.0 RPM) constantly.  I have tried so far:  ol liClear all Safari cached/li liRestart laptop/li liRemove/disable all extensions/li liUninstall all the software that might possibly affecting e.g. Anti-Virus/li /ol  The issue is only happening in Safari. Chrome and Firefox are both OK.  Thanks for helping in advance!

It was stuck in a loop trying to access a file it couldn't./strong   To see if this might be an issue for you run:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --verify --standard-pkgs / /code/pre  And see if there are any files wile damaged permissions. For me it was:  precodePermissions differ on "Library/Java", should be drwxr-xr-x , they are drwxrwxr-x . User differs on "private/var/db/displaypolicyd", should be 0, user is 244. Group differs on "private/var/db/displaypolicyd", should be 0, group is 244. /code/pre  So it is a good chance Java permissions are the culprit. To fix run:  precodesudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume / /code/pre  And then restart Safari. For me this immediately dropped CPU use from 150% to 14%.   One should note if you have 100s of faulty permissions, it could be an early sign of disk failure. As always, keep backups.  I hope this helps someone else out there.  <answer268279> developer mode seems to be buggy; acknowledged today by Apple with recent consumer reports with the new MacBook Pro 2016.  A patch is on the way in beta testing now.  <comment268014> 65 degrees is not really dangerous for the mac, max temp is around 100 degrees ;) It seems that your are downloading something ? <comment268016> The weird thing is I am not doing anything with Safari. Just randomly opened a few tabs like Google and Facebook and leave it there. Also it is not making any sense to me that an idle Safari can generate 65+ degrees. <comment268019> Tried, not working <comment268020> Did you tried to disabled some safari add-ons ? Or are you using a download manager like Folx ? <comment268021> Also tried with removing all extensions in Safari <comment268025> Strange... And when safari is sucking the cpu, does it take a lot of bandwidth ? <comment268030> Updated the question with network activity. It seems like no network activity at all. <comment323745> Seems `repair_packages` is not available in macSierra. Not found here.
