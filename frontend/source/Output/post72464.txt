What's causing this purple banding on video shot with my iPhone 5? <body> I shot my first two video with an iPhone 5 last weekend, and both suffered from the same flash of purple banding you can see in this clip:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGLWJKDj1fE  I've tried searching to see if it's a known defect but haven't been able to find anything. Does anyone recognise this defect? Is it documented anywhere?  strongUpdate:/strong my phone subsequently died of an unrelated complaint and was replaced with a new one by Apple. That suffers from exactly the same problem. So it wasn't just a hardware glitch in a single device.
