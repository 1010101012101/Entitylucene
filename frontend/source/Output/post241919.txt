iTunes Store is unavailable <body> Recently I am downloading movies from iTunes Store and books from iBooks Store. But one annoying thing that I've ran into these days are The Movie/iBooks store is unavailable. This is happening for a week now. I've checked the Apple's Service Availability Page but it says that everything is available. Here are screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gr8Xz.jpg" alt="Movies Store unavailable"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v1s0.jpg" alt="iBooks Store unavailable"  This is happening on an iPhone 6s and iPad Pro if it does matter. My Apple ID country is China and my location is in China.  Thanks  <answer241920> China blocked the iTunes store and iBook store due to it's political issues with Apple.  [Update] VPN doesn't help, it's account based not location based.  <comment297352> Thanks, I manage to get it to work after switching to one of my US account. <comment297354> Your welcome! So it's account based and not location based. Or did you use a VPN connection? <comment297355> It's account based. I tried VPN with the Chinese account and it still don't work. Switch to US account and it worked instantly.
