How can I solve this BootCamp partition mess I've created? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8GLc0.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is my codediskutil/code list. I've gotten my new iMac today and everything was going great so I wanted to install windows via bootcamp. After it booted into Windows setup I had problems choosing and formatting the BootCamp partition that was created, so I deleted it and chose new. After this didn't work either I restarted and after several different tries I now have this mess of partitions that I can`t delete via BootCamp Assistant nor Disk Utility.   Does anyone have an idea how I can solve this so I can get to my original FusionDrive disk to try from the beginning?  <answer286466> ul liBoot to Internet Recovery Mode/li liOpen Terminal in the menubar  Utilities/li liEnter codediskutil list/code to get the disk identifiers of your internal SSD (probably disk0), HDD (probably disk1) and the CoreStorage volume (probably disk3 or disk4 - apply the disk identifiers below according to the findings in your environment)/li liNow remove the seven partitions on the HDD with gpt:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk3 #the device identifier of the CoreStorage volume diskutil umountDisk disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD diskutil umountDisk disk0 #the device identifier of the SSD gpt remove -i 9 disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD /code/pre  Repeat the above steps six times but lower the index number (-i) by one in each step:  precodediskutil umountDisk disk3 #the device identifier of the CoreStorage volume diskutil umountDisk disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD diskutil umountDisk disk0 #the device identifier of the SSD gpt remove -i 8 disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD /code/pre  ...  precodediskutil umountDisk disk3 #the device identifier of the CoreStorage volume diskutil umountDisk disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD diskutil umountDisk disk0 #the device identifier of the SSD gpt remove -i 3 disk1 #the device identifier of the HDD /code/pre/li liResize the CoreStorage stack:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack lvUUID 2120g /code/pre  with lvUUID: the UUID of your Logical Volume (8DC64131-3881-4971-B870-2FB6BFB58EDB)/li liReboot to your main volume/li liReinstall your current system to recreate your missing RecoveryHD or use this tool Recovery Partition Creator/li /ul  hr  Instead it should also be possible to merge all partitions (disk1s3-disk1s9) to free space and expand the CS LV then without booting to Internet Recovery Mode (untested):  precodediskutil mergePartitions Free Space disk1s3 disk1s9 /code/pre  Then reinstall your current system to recreate your missing RecoveryHD or use this tool Recovery Partition Creator
