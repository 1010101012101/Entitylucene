Changing the resolution of the iPod Touch 4th generation <body> My son was playing with my iPod Touch 4th generation and changed the screen resolution.  I don't know how to fix this.    How do I change the screen resolution back to what it is supposed to be?    Everything on my iPod is way too big and I can't do anything.    <answer15358> I think you may have turned on the Zoom or Large Text feature. Head over to strongSettings  General  Accessibility/strong. turn zoom off in there, or Large Text.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NMzGI.png" alt="Accessibility Options"  <answer15360> In case your son does it again: If you ever get stuck at a fully zoomed in view, double tap with three fingers to fully zoom in/out.  <comment16650> @Teresa Great! Glad to hear it
