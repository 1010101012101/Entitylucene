By preventing other background processes from recording or accessing your keystrokes, you are ensuring they cannot be logged or monitored, eg. by a simple keylogger, or another program running with normal permissions for potentially malicious purposes.  <comment81985> I wouldn't bet on the keylogger part. After all there is still data flowing from the keyboard to the computer which can be intercepted on a lower level (or even the wire). <comment82146> While that may be true, it prevents many of the popular software-based keyloggers for OS X, such as logKext, by ensuring only the foreground process receives input at the OS level.
