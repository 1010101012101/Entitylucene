How can I remove the Finder icon from my Dock? <body> I've started using Forklift as a Finder replacement, so I don't need Finder in my Dock. In fact, I would much rather have Forklift be the farthest left icon so I don't accidentally click on Finder.  The usual method of dragging the app out of the Dock doesn't work, and neither does command-dragging. The contextual menu doesn't allow you to remove the icon.  strongIs there some way to, on Lion, remove the Finder from the Dock?/strongbr Perhaps there's a database or plist file I can change?  <answer30429> There is no easy way to do this, but there is a little hack :)  ol liNavigate to /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources//li liBackup DockMenus.plist/li liOpen DockMenus.plist in your favorite text editor with root access/li liFind section codefinder-running/code and add new sub-section  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;command&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;1004&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;name&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;REMOVE_FROM_DOCK&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  or just Download my version of DockMenus.plist/li liIn plist editor file should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIcP8.jpg" alt="Plist Editor"/li liOpen Terminal and run codekillall Dock/code. /li liRight click on Finder icon in Dock - Bingo!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ym3bM.png" alt="Finder &quot;Remove from dock&quot;" /li /ol  p.s After Dock restart (manual relaunch or mac reboot) you need manually remove Finder icon from Dock   <comment34912> Oneliner :) `f=/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/DockMenus; sudo cp $f.plist $f-old.plist; sudo defaults write $f finder-running -array-add 'dictkeycommand/keyinteger1004/integerkeyname/keystringREMOVE_FROM_DOCK/string/dict'; sudo chmod 644 $f.plist; osascript -e 'quit app "Dock"'`. I didn't find any way (other than GUI scripting) to automatically remove Finder from Dock after relogins though. <comment34913> Oh and modifying stuff inside Dock's bundle will obviously break its code signature. You might want to back up Dock.app as well. <comment34918> @Lri oneliner is efficient but always confusing. About code signature - in case of problems with modified Dock.app you could restore *.plist from backup and run codesign -v /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock.This should solve the problem. <comment35006> Awesome, thanks! I set up a script to run at login to click the menu item: `tell application "System Events" to tell UI element "Finder" of list 1 of process "Dock"  perform action "AXShowMenu"  click menu item "Remove from Dock" of menu 1 end tell` <comment82134> Will this break the code signing of the Dock, per Stevetech's answer? <comment114085> Nice, but I failed to find REMOVE_FROM_DOCK in 10.8.4 , is there another method I can choose to hide finder please? <comment144917> Works for me on Mavericks.  Except that the white 'light' underneath the icon (or rather, where the icon would be) is still there). <comment180391> @eebbesen you'd have to quit finder before removing it from Dock. <comment303757> Looks like It doesn't work in El Capitan. <comment320426> This thread suggests it has something to do with the new "rootless" feature, which might have a workaround http://support.cocoatech.com/discussions/problems/34969-remove-from-dock-option-for-finder-and-trash-broken
