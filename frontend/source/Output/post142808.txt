What are the trusted Certificate Authorities in iOS? <body> I'm wondering if StartCom is a trusted CA on iOS.  I'd like to setup a mail server for a TLD, and use their free certificate. It's only about $10/year cheaper than more well known authorities, so the deciding factor is if it's trusted on my iPhone.  I know it is on OS X, Windows and many linux distributions, but would like to be certain.  <answer142817> I think this Apple support article has the list you're looking for. It is updated as changes are made:  iOS: List of available trusted root certificates  And StartCom is on there.  <answer173999> Here's the trust list for iOS 7:  http://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT203065  <comment204757> This link goes to iOS 8 now. <comment204785> @Almo I edited my question and this answer to make it less prone to obsolescence.
