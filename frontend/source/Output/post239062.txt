OSX: hard disk space different in Disk utility <body> I have 2 differents 'free space' digits. And after delete something big from disk - free space in 'About your mac' - still unchanged. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORbXY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment293288> Sorry, I don't read Russian, could you please translate that? <comment293339> This question is similar to the one I posted some times ago where there were even three different HD space indications in my Mac. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/215213/different-free-space-indications-in-macintosh-hd-after-upgrading-to-el-capitan Unfortunately, I didn't get any answer. Any help? <comment293443> @mgiordi - yeap, problem was solved! I answer on your question. <comment293444> @brick - different GB for availability  (59,35 GB vs 139,6 GB)
