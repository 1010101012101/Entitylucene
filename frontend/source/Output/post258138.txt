Internal file of iOS app gets corrupted during app installation <body> I'm trying to install an enterprise application, which contains database inside (in .db file). This db file gets corrupted every time, I see that size of this file is differs after every installation: normal file size is 650 Mb, but after installation it is become for example 481 Mb or 512 Mb or 504 Mb, new every time. I have no idea what happens and how I can fix it. Application crashes until I replace corrupted file with original one via iExplorer or similar soft. Unfortunately I have no deep knowledge in iOS and its methods of application install to understand what`s happening. I hope someone can point me where I should look for the root cause of such issue. Issue is recurring on iOS 9 and iOS 10 as well.
