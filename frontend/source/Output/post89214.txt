How to quick switch OSX proxy on/off? <body> I use SwitchySharp to quick switch between multi-proxies under  Chrome broswer.  Now I want to move to Safari(I love its "Tap to Zoom" feature), but SwitchySharp only works in Chrome, there is no a counterpart in Safari extension.  So I wonder if there is a system level quick proxy switcher script or free app?  <answer89225> Have you tried using the Locations feature?  ol liGo to System Preferences  Network,/li liClick on the "Location" dropdown menu,/li liChoose "Edit Locations",/li liClick on the add button and give the location a name.  I would suggest you give it a name that's related to the proxy,/li liNow that you've setup a new location, go through the networking configuration, ensuring you set the relevant proxy setting under the "Proxies" tab, which can be found under the Ethernet/WiFi adapter settings  Advanced./li /ol  Repeat steps 1-5 for each proxy.  Once you've finished, you can quickly switch between each proxy by clicking on the Apple icon (located at the top left of your screen) and going to "Location".  Once the Location menu expands, you should see all your different locations, which have the relevant proxy settings within them.  Clicking on the locations will change the proxy settings your Mac uses.  <answer177219> I just found ControlPlane, lasted version is code1.6.5/code.   It's a great application that can take certain actions upon certain context change events, e.g. context change event can be connected to a specified WiFi network (per SSID), and action can be switch locations, hence uses location specific proxies.  And here is a step-by-step guide, which explains how to achieve this using ControlPlane.  <comment135025> Very nice feature, thank you. <comment209536> possible to automatically switch location based on the currently available WiFi network? <comment295646> This allows much more than Proxy on/off feature! Anyone should be aware of this tool.
