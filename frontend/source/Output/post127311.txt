Safari AutoFill/Preferences <body> My question is: where does one find this option in the preferences for Safari Version 7.0.3 (9537.75.14)? I cannot find this option anywhere: not in Mac OS X System Preferences or in Safari’s own Preferences. I would love to be able to save the passwords for these sites, so that I don’t have to keep regenerating and re-remembering them.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zrbEG.png" alt="Allow AutoFill even for websites that request passwords not be saved"  <answer127313> I'm guessing it has been removed from Safari. According to this knowledge base article (under "Safari isn't automatically filling in account names and passwords on some web sites.") The checkbox should be in codePreferences &gt; Passwords/code. I don't see it there on my computer which has the exact same Safari Version with no Private Browsing.   <answer127357> It's gone. Use this extension to work around it: http://ozymandias.me/2013/05/08/force-autocomplete-on-in-safari/  <comment258930> Link has gone so the reason for closing link answers is correct again
