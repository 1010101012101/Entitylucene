How can I encrypt a folder in OS X Mavericks <body> If possible, how can I encrypt a folder with a password on OS X Mavericks?  <answer129722> OS X doesn't ship with a folder by folder encryption. You can create an encrypted sparse bundle which acts as a folder that is decrypted once it mounts and stores all contents in an encrypted form on disk.  ol liEnable advanced image options in Disk Utility:  precodedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1 /code/pre/li liOpen Disk Utility (found in code/Applications/Utilities//code)./li liSelect strongFile/strong → strongNew/strong → strongDisk Image from Folder…/strong or press kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbdN/kbd./li liSelect the folder that contains your files and press strongImage/strong./li liChoose strongsparsebundle/strong as the Image Format, and choose the level of encryption you require.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9M8GK.png" width="400"/li liChoose a password to encrypt the image. Make sure to uncheck the strongRemember password in my Keychain/strong box if you want to be prompted each time you attempt to mount the disk./li liClick OK. Disk Utility will create a sparse bundle to hold your files. Don't forget to delete the original folder./li /ol  You can make an alias (or a symbolic link, symlink for short) to folders in the encrypted folder to hide much of the difference between a disk image and the actual encrypted folder if desired. Alternatively, you can mount this disk image in a custom folder (instead of /Volumes) for even smoother access.  <answer130562> If you are willing to consider an app, there's a review on Tidbits of Hider 2:  http://tidbits.com/e/14740  In the comments are references to Knox and Concealer.  <comment152406> Or better: Mount it directly to the desired folder. <comment152407> And it doesn't have to be sparse, does it? <comment152408> @Max It doesn't have to be, but if it is, it will automatically expand to hold the contents. <comment152409> But performance will be worse. <comment169904> In Mavericks, the Image Format popup has changed. Choices are now "read-only", "read/write", among others. I'm guessing that "read/write" means sparse image. <comment227327> @Dogweather I don't think so, because the folder size doesn't seem to expand. I get a "not enough free space" error when trying to add some large files. A workaround is to image a folder with more files than you need, then remove some after its done to free up space in the image. <comment227331> @Dogweather I took that screenshot in Mavericks. Forgot to mention that you need advanced image options enabled—edited answer. <comment227441> That's useful. With sparsebundle I still run into some arbitrary size limits on the image. I wonder where these come from. For example: encrypt a folder of some pdf's as a sparsebundle AES 256. Then mount the encrypted image and add a 1GB movie. Error not enough space. Does this happen for others?
