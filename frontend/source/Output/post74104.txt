How can I rename a Logical Volume Group? <body> I have noticed that while I can safely change the name of the strongLogical Volume/strong (codeLM Volume/code) in code/Volumes/code (currently: codeApple SSD/code), I cannot find a way to change the name of the strongLogical Volume Group/strong (currently: codeCrucial M4 SSD/code).  The latter is a legacy from my previous Macbook Pro's hard drive. Can I change this name?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBHQ5.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hQJfo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer90821> You can change the name, but doing so requires that you wipe the entire drive. If you're happy to do that, and with the disclaimer that this is scary stuff, then:  ul liRight click the drive in Finder and Eject it./li liOpen Terminal  ul liType codediskutil list/code and find the identifier for the GUID_partition_scheme of the disk you want to wipe./li liType codesudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/INDENTIFIER bs=1024 count=1024/code, replacing codeIDENTIFIER/code with the identifier of the disk you want to wipe. Do not get the identifier wrong./li /ul/li liOpen Disk Utility  ul liYou will see the newly formatted disk, now with its factory supplied name rather than the out of date name that was bothering you./li liIf you wish to further replace this with a specific name of your choosing:  ul liSelect the disk and click the 'Erase' tab./li liChoose 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)'. [OSX only renames the Logical Volume Group if you encrypt the drive. If you don't want to encrypt the drive, then just keep the factory name.]/li liType your desired name into the 'Name' box and click 'Erase...'./li liThe logical volume group and the first disk partition will now have identical names. If you then wish to rename the disk partition, you can do so easily by simply selecting the disk in Finder, hitting Ctrl-I and updating its name in the pop-up dialog./li /ul/li /ul/li /ul  <answer107979> I renamed the "Logical Volume Group" on all of my drives using Disk Utility (OS X 10.8.5)   strongNOTE/strong: The LVG will only be renamed when the drive is erased with encryption.           DO NOT use "Case Sensitive" it is not recommended by Apple and others.    ol liUsing Disk Utility, erase the drive emwithout/em encryption./li liUsing Disk Utility, erase the drive a second time, emwith/em encryption, giving it the name you want it to have. The drive and the volume will have the same name./li /ol  <answer135409> If you have Yosemite installed, codediskutil/code now includes the option to rename a Core Storage logical volume group (LVG) from the command line:  precode$ diskutil cs rename Usage:  diskutil coreStorage rename lvgUUID|lvgName newName Rename a CoreStorage logical volume group. Do not confuse this with LV names. Ownership of the affected disks is required. /code/pre  So use codediskutil cs list/code to get a list of your CoreÂ Storage volumes, then codediskutil cs rename "Crucial M4 SSD" newVolumeGroupName/code to rename the LVG.    I haven't tested this on a mounted volume, so I don't know if you can do it without unmounting the volume. That may mean that you need to boot off an external disk with Yosemite installed in order to rename the LVG.  <comment146260> That worked for me. <comment172388> With pre-release 14A361c, a rename of an LVG succeeds without an unmount of its LV. <comment293208> To clarify: This worked for me while the (encrypted) drive was mounted and it didn't wipe the drive. Perfect solution. Thank you very much.
