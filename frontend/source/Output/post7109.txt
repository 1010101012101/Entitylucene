What's the difference between one finger dragging and drag lock? <body> If I go into Settings  Trackpad and enable Tap to click, I can enable the settings Dragging and Drag Lock.  What is the difference between these two settings?  It appears that they are doing the same exact thing when I try to use them. From my understanding, if I don't have drag lock enabled, I should be able to double tap then drag a window, after I lift up my finger, the dragging should stop. However, that is not the case, I must tap again in order for the dragging to stop.  <answer7111> If you enable codeDrag Lock/code after you do your desire change you must tap you finger to release dragged item but if you disable it if you do your desire change you only need to put up your finger form trackpad.  <answer7195> I believe I figured out the difference:  Dragging:  ol liDouble tap and hold to begin dragging./li liRelease the mouse./li liDepending on the amount of time that has passed, moving the mouse will do one of the following: ul liBrief delay: moving the mouse continues the dragging, essentially behaving the exact same way as drag lock. The cycle is then repeated once you release your finger./li liLonger delay: dragging is stopped./li /ul/li /ol  Dragging &amp; Drag Lock:  ol liDouble tap and hold to begin dragging./li liRelease the mouse./li liMoving the mouse will continue dragging./li liTap once to stop the dragging./li /ol  It's that brief delay that was throwing me off. There doesn't seem to be any way to customize the length of this delay. One thing that does help, though, is figuring out exactly how long this delay is. One method for figuring this out is the following:  ol liDrag an icon from the dock a tiny bit so that if you were to release it, it wouldn't be deleted./li liRelease the mouse./li liObserve how long it takes for the icon to move back to its place. That is the exact amount of minimum time that you should wait when you are finished dragging something./li /ol  <comment7587> I'm on Mac OS X 10.6.6, and that's not how it works for me. It appears that they both do the same thing. <comment7591> @sense I am on OS X 10.6.6 too, but it works for me, I don't know the reason! <comment7596> I'll probably take it into Apple, then. <comment66040> Would love to be able to customize/disable that delay. If anyone has any tips please share!
