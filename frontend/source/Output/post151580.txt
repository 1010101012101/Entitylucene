Wi-Fi interface missing <body> I have a Macbook Pro from 2011 currently running OS X Yosemite 10.10. Before i upgraded to Yosemite, i was experiencing a common wifi issue that was that the wifi disconnected from the internet and it couldn't be turn on or off; sometimes, when i turned on the mac, a "No hardware installed" message showed.  I replaced the wifi card but the problem persisted and now that i upgraded the OS, the configuration didn't recognise any hardware and no Wi-Fi interface is shown on Network Preferences.  I know there is a file codeLibrary/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInteraces.plist/code that contains these interfaces information.  Is there anyway that i can configure this file to add the wifi card? or is there something else that i can do? knowing that replacing the wifi card didn't solve the problem and that it may be a software issue?  Thanks   <answer265360> It's possible that Wi-Fi service is disabled in your system, check by:  precodesudo networksetup -listallnetworkservices /code/pre  If you see an asterisk (*) next to your WiFi, that means the service is disabled. Enable it by:  precodenetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled WiFi on networksetup -setairportpower en0 on /code/pre  Same for any other network services which are disabled. See also this post and this post.  Then restart your system to start these services at startup.  <comment178380> does the terminal "airport on" do anything? <comment178381> There is no such file on my 10.9.5 NetworkInteraces.plist <comment178416> the "airport on" command displays something like the man of the "airport" command <comment178453> sorry, try this to turn the wifi on "networksetup -setairportpower en0 on" <comment178613> It shows "you cannot set wifi power because all airport network services are disabled" <comment178615> OK, that was for the WiFi, how about the airport card "networksetup -setairportpower airport on" and you do have at least one of the networks set up in networks preferences? <comment178685> It shows the same message: "you cannot set wifi power because all airport network services are disabled"
