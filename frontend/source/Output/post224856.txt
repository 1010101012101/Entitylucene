Should I upgrade RAM on my MacMini? <body> I have a MacMini with following specification:  ol liMac min (Late 2012)/li li2.5 GHz Intel Core i5/li li4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3/li liIntel HD Graphics 4000 1024 MB/li /ol  My system slows up pretty fast when I work with large excel files or have multiple browser windows open or have too many applications running simultaneously. I mainly use my system for software development and have following things always runnnig  ol liOutlook /li liSafari or Chrome (If I open both together, it slows up a lot)/li liSkype/li liSublimeText/li liOther applications like Dropbox, Google Drive working in background./li /ol  I want to improve the speed and I think increasing the RAM to 8GB should do the trick. But I am not sure. Does increasing the RAM would help me solve my issue? Also, should I go with RAM specified by Apple or other RAMs are fine?  <comment272748> Not sure this is "opinion based." Slowish Macs can be traced to (usually) not enough RAM or a slow HD. More RAM *may* help the issue. Replacing your HD with an SSD will almost definitely help the issue. I'd do both. Yes it could be an O/S issue but Occam's Razor suggests it is likely those two. <comment273113> Look at the [Activity Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Monitor) app that Apple gave you. Older version shows pie chart for memory where you want to see a significant green slice; if just a sliver or none then you need more RAM. Newer versions show a "Memory Pressure" line chart. If rising high or changing to a color other than green, then you need more memory. **Adding memory never hurts**, may be a huge help, is cheap, and is easy. Buy from Mac-aware vendors such as Crucial.com, OrherWorldComputing.com. <comment273192> I too don't see this post being "opinion-based", please open the post or help to craft same to meet the rules, please! This is a question which covers my concern too for 5 mac-mini that I own. Increasing RAM seems obvious choice. Experts  - Please advise! <comment273207> Thanks @SteveChambers and Basil. I checked the Memory Pressure and  chart is currently green for me though I do not have the Outlook and large excel files open. I will have a look at it even more detail when I machine is running slow.   And Chirag - Agreed; the answer to this can't be completely opining-based.
