Disable message autoselect in OS X Mail <body> Is there a way to stop Mail from automatically selecting messages? For example when I delete a message, it will immediately select the next one and mark it read. Then if I don't want to read the message yet, I need to mark it as unread.  <answer187632> strikeI'm afraid you can not change this behaviour in the Mail.app settings. /strike  Edit: As @myhd pointed out, you can indeed change the behaviour with kbd⌥/kbd + kbd⌫ Delete/kbd!  <answer187892> I, too, prefer that Mail.app not mark the next message as read. I am also using Yosemite. The only way that I know of to accomplish this is to hide the message viewer:  Mail = Preferences = Viewing tab = select 'Use classic layout'  Now the Mail window only shows the list of Mailboxes on the left (which is optional) and the messages in the current mailbox on the right. (You may need to drag the divider between the message list pane and the message viewer pane all the way down to the bottom of the window.) To view a message, double-click it in the list view and it opens in a separate window. From there, you can close, reply, forward, mark or delete it. If you delete it, the next message in the list is highlighted, but not marked as read until you open it.  Hope this helps.  <answer188015> Press kbdoption/kbd+kbddelete/kbd or kbdoption/kbd+kbd←/kbd to delete an email and strongnot/strong select the next email.  If you use an international keyboard: United states kbdoption/kbd key may be labelled kbdalt/kbd and/or kbd⌥/kbd.  <comment221921> If you are not using Yosemite, try [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/156570/54484) and increase the amount of time before a message is marked as read. If you are using Yosemite, there is no way to change the time before it is marked as read, and no way to prevent it from automatically selecting the next message. <comment222089> Yeah, I'm using Yosemite. Thanks for your answer. <comment222400> This should be the selected answer! <comment222467> Wow, awesome! This is great, thank you, myhd! <comment222472> I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the heads up!
