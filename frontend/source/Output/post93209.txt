How to preserve ratings from ipod touch that has never synced with new computer <body> About a year ago I lost my ipod touch.  It had about 40gb of songs on it, many of which had been given ratings (to aid with quickly selecting 'good' songs).  It was recently found, but the computer on which I run itunes has never synced with it.  When I switch on sync music it tells me it will remove everything on the ipod to be replaced with the music on the computer,  I'd be ok with this as the music is the same.. strongexcept/strong that I don't want to lose those ratings.  Will the ratings from the ipod be applied to the same songs on the computer if I sync?  If not, is there a way to keep those ratings (and transfer them to the new ipod I had to buy after losing the old one)  <comment109358> Where did you get the songs that are on the iPod? <comment109423> Most of them are ripped from CDs I own. <comment109424> That's too bad. It's much harder to transfer songs like that back to your computer, and at that point, who knows if the ratings will make it over. I believe most people use 3rd-party software at that point. Perhaps something like: http://www.fadingred.com/senuti/. Still, while I would like to think it would transfer ratings, one wouldn't know unless they try. I suppose the trial could work for that. However, on a different note, I wonder if an Apple store would be willing to make that transfer to the new iPod for you?
