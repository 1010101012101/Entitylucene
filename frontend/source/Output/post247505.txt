Can't get iPad mini into recovery mode <body> Good day,  After several failed attempts, my iPad Mini is locked and the error codeiPad is disabled - Try again in 13,568/code is appearing.  Now, I do not have anything important on the device and I am totally okay if I lose everything in there.  However, I am not able to get it to work in recovery mode using the following technique  ul liturn the device off./li liopen itunes/li lihold home button for couple of seconds./li liinsert the USB cable/li /ul  After doing this steps, the device boots normally and gets stuck on the codedisabled/code page again.  What can I do to bypass this?  <answer247508> Try this:  Turn on the iPad. Now hold both the home button and lock/power button. Keep holding the buttons until it is in recovery mode. You needs to hold it for about 10 seconds or so. After iTunes logo appear you can update or restore the iPad.   <comment305473> Try again in 13,568? <comment305584> @JohnRamos probably the best answer.
