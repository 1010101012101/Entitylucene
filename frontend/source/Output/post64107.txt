Terminal in full screen mode: how do I recover from "cat /dev/random" <body> What are the ways I can regain control over my computer when I have terminal in full screen mode and type:  codecat /dev/random/code  <answer64109> Just tested this, type codecontrol-c/code in terminal, it should stop any running command.  <answer64132> If you have Terminal.app open anyway (doesn't matter whether it's in fullscreen mode or not):  ul likbdCmd-T/kbd to create new tab/shell/li licodeps aux | fgrep /dev/random/code to find the running codecat/code (you can grep for codecat/code as well but there might be more than one matching line)/li licodekill &lt;PID from above&gt;/code (or codekill -9 &lt;PID&gt;/code)/li /ul  Just be patient, the system may be really slow (even on a multicore system as I've just found out).  <comment75185> Why are you typing `cat /dev/random`? <comment75187> Perhaps the keyboard buffer was still full for me... ctrl c had no effect <comment75188> @DanielLawson - I'm learning OSX and experimenting. I hope to learn how to recover from a runaway process, which may happen in a developer environment (which I'm in) <comment75189> Really! I tried several times, and each time I was able to get out of 'cat' no problem. <comment75190> I ended up going into activity monitor and killing the cat.  Fortunately I only had to do it once <comment75191> Fair enough. Seems like a strange thing to do, but I've seen (much) worse before. <comment75223> Is "kill -9" a joke referring to 9 lives of a cat, or is it something else? <comment75224> See `man kill`, -9 is the signal to send. By default, kill sends a "soft" termination (letting the application/command handle the termination itself). This may not work if the application is stuck in some loop and never gets to handle the signal. -9 terminates on OS level. <comment75228> You might need to reset the terminal with command-R. <comment75266> You can press the power button and hold it. The filesystem is journaled and you'll soon learn which programs don't save their files cleanly :-/ <comment77810> Would `killall cat` not work? <comment77816> There might be several cats running through the (process) jungle, no reason to commit felinicide... <comment83941> @makerofthings7 In general, you should at _least_ try `kill -TERM` or `kill -INT` (which is the same as `^C`) first; [jumping straight to `SIGKILL` is often a bad idea.](http://www.novosial.org/shell/kill-9/index.html)
