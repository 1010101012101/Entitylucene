External drive uninitialized after changing partition scheme failed <body> I was recently trying to partition my external drive into two parts, but I seem to have accidentally broken the partition table by trying to make the empty (1.7TB) part of the disk into a new HFS partition using a botched codediskutil/code command. The previous data partition is now not visible on diskutil and does not automatically mount when the hard drive is connected.  Here is my current output of codesudo gpt -r -vvv show /dev/disk1/code:  precodegpt show: /dev/disk1: mediasize=2000398933504; sectorsize=512; blocks=3907029167 gpt show: /dev/disk1: MBR at sector 0 gpt show: /dev/disk1: MBR part: type=175, start=357082196, size=3341511771        start        size  index  contents            0           1         MBR            1   357082195    357082196  3341511771      1  MBR part 175   3698593967   208435200 /code/pre  codediskutil list/code doesn't seem to show the second partition:  precode/dev/disk1 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk1    1:                  Apple_HFS                         1.7 TB     disk1s1 /code/pre  When I attempt to quick search for partitions using testdisk, it gives me a message saying that the partition is unrecoverable:  precodeDisk /dev/rdisk1 - 2000 GB / 1863 GiB - 3907029167 sectors  The harddisk (2000 GB / 1863 GiB) seems too small!

It with an error saying it couldn't write to the disk.  <comment370306> Please check your bash history file, search for the "botched"  diskutil command and add it to your question. <comment370341> @klanomath I have edited the question, the command was `diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk1 GPT JHFS+ New 512g`, which failed saying the drive couldn't be written.
