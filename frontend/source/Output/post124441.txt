OSX Mavericks jumping spotlight menu <body> Just upgraded to the latest version of Mavericks.  When I start a spotlight query, it seems that the spotlight menu is jumping around.  I took a screencast of it and copied a few frames showing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRk08.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTsst.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm running an early 2013 13" Retina MBP  <comment145576> Can you reproduce that on a new user with no menu bar items running except for Apple's stock items?
