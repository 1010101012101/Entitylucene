Partition SSD in Yosemite for Dual-Booting Ubuntu <body> I've just bought a new Macbook Air (running Yosemite) and I am trying to create a partition from my Macintosh HD SSD for dual-booting Ubuntu. However when I try to create a partition in Disk Utilities, I keep getting the error "This Core Storage operation is not allowed on a sparse logical volume group." I have tried restarting the system in Recovery Mode and verifying and repairing the disk, but it did not work.  What can I do to partition? (I would prefer to not format the SSD.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RzLWl.png" alt="disk utilities screenshot"  <answer175713> You have to boot from another device or to Internet Recovery Mode and then use the command line to modify the CoreStorage volume.  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite)./li /ul  strongModify CoreStorage:/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utilities/Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code/li liEnter codediskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size/code with LVUUID: UUID of the logical volume and size: the final size of your Macintosh HDbr Example: codediskutil cs resizeStack DC2473AF-0833-4DBD-BF8F-D5D60063554A 200g/code  /li liEnter codeexit/code and quit Terminal./li liReboot to your main volume./li liStart installing Ubuntu to the now unallocated disk space./li /ul
