Copy An Event From iPhoto <body> Is there a way to copy just the contents of a single event from iPhoto to another location?   When I want to zip up all of the photos in a single event and move them somewhere, like to a USB drive, I have to look at the event photos, click a photo, then choose File-Show In Finder, then select, copy, and zip the folders containing the event photos I want. This seems like way too many steps for what seems like a simple task.  <answer36483> Simply drag the event out of iPhoto to the destination folder&nbsp;&nbsp;;)  If you really want to zip them, use the Export to archive iPhoto plugin.  <comment41514> I feel silly now. I knew there had to be an easy way that I hadn't thought of. I kept looking for a menu item. Thanks!
