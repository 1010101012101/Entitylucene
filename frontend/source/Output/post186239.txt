Can you put 2012 macbook air 13 inch ssd in macbook air 11 inch 2012? <body> I am thinking about doing something like that. Or would it not work?  <answer186242> Yes, it will work as they are the same type SSD between those two models.  <comment219907> It was perfectly clear to me what Jake was asking and why I took the time to look up the specs on both models to verify the SSD were interchangeable between them and  answered the question in the Title.  IMO the "**put on hold**" is at times taken to the extreme, as in this case!
