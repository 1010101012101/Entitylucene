Loopback in Yosemite not working <body> I'm on Yosemite (10.10.2). Since upgrading I got some DNS issues, it seems my loopback isn't working any more. When I'm talking to my app locally via codehttp://localhost:port/code, localhost in some cases (sorry for being vague here) gets resolved to my current local IP. (observed with rails and openstack)  some analysis:  precodemac:~ me$ scutil -r localhost Reachable,Local Address,Directly Reachable Address mac:~ me$ scutil -r loopback Not Reachable /code/pre  etc/hosts:  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0     localhost /code/pre  etc/networks:  precodeloopback        127             loopback-net /code/pre  And a maybe related issue: DNS sometimes stops working completely. The only thing that helps, is a force quit of the codediscoveryd/code process.  I appreciate any help guiding me in the right direction to solve this issue. Thanks in advance.  <answer187637> This might possibly be not the best long-term solution - I can't fully test as I don't actually have active IPv6 from my ISP yet, only on my local network.  I simply set my hosts file to  precode127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             127.0.0.1  fe80::1%lo0     127.0.0.1 /code/pre  which has so far given no noticeable issues.  <comment216002> Have you been able to find a solution to this? <comment222098> My workaround is to always use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, luckily that was configurable everywhere I needed it. <comment222099> Thanks for the suggestion, but well this does not solve the loopback issue: `mac:~ me$ scutil -r localhost    Reachable,Local Address    mac:~ me$ scutil -r loopback    Not Reachable`  so the only thing that changed is, that localhost isn't a 'Directly Reachable Address' any more
