Remap Top-Row Number Keys <body> I've tried Ukulele and KeyRemap4MacBook. Neither does what I need to do.  I want to map the top-row kbd4/kbd key and the top-row kbd8/kbd key to kbdSHIFT/kbd. So that, for example, when I press kbd4/kbd + kbdg/kbd it types a capital G.  Hitting the shift key with my pinkie is aggravating my carpal tunnel. On my windows machine I just remapped kbd4/kbd and kbd8/kbd to shift and I use a keypad if I need numbers. Savior for my hands.  <answer34232> Ukelele should be able to kind of do this by making 4 a "deadkey" that generates the uppercase letter for any key typed after it, unless there is a limit on the number of keys you can have in such a sequence.  (Just like alt + e is a deadkey that generates acute accented versions of any vowel typed after it)  Of course this is not exactly like Shift, because you can't hold it down, you have let 4 go before you hit the next letter.   <comment39021> Wow this is quite a question. Let's see if people can solve this... <comment39108> I've done something similar with my current keyboard layout, but there are obviously some additional issues. You'll still have to use the actual shift keys with keyboard shortcuts. And it won't work in virtualized environments. And for example dead key sequences don't enter table cell editing mode in iWork apps.
