Connection through router in iPad Mini <body> I want to know whether I can get internet connection on my iPad Mini (WiFi only) through my router.br If yes, what are the criteria of that router?  <answer81871> Yes. If it is a wireless router, iPad Mini allows you to connect to any standard wifi.  As per Apple's technical specification page the iPad Mini can connect to a network that meets the following requirements:     802.11a/b/g/n Wiâ€‘Fi (802.11n 2.4GHz and 5GHz)   For example, if you have a 802.11 2.4GHz b network, the iPad Mini should connect to it.  <comment94362> I think any router will do.
