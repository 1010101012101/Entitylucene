Command+TAB (⌘⇥) to switch to most recent window (even on different space) <body> The default behaviour of kbd⌘⇥/kbd is roughly the following:  ol liSwitch to the most recently used app./li liBring all windows of that application (in the current space) to the foreground./li liGive the most recent window focus./li liIs there no window of that app on the current space? Switch to most recent used space with that app./li /ol  Say I have two windows of the same application open. One is running full screen in a separate Space, while the other is on the Desktop Space with other application windows. Take for example the following spaces:  ol liDesktop: Safari + Mail Window  1/li liFull Screen: Mail Window 2/li /ol  So now I'm working in Mail Window 2 (Space 2), kbd⌘⇥/kbd brings me to Safari (Space 1). However kbd⌘⇥/kbd again and I'm taken to Mail Window 1 (Space 1), whereas I would've wanted to go back to Mail Window 2 (Space 2). In order to go back to Mail Window 2 by keyboard, I have to go through all spaces using kbd⌃→/kbd or kbd⌃1/kbd..kbd⌃9/kbd, which is cumbersome when working with more than 2 spaces.  Is there a keyboard shortcut I'm missing, or a way to change how kbd⌘⇥/kbd could work for my use case?  <answer223181> There is the default shortcut kbd⌘/kbdkbd`/kbd (that's a backtick [or kbd⌘/kbdkbd`/kbd for QWERTZ keyboard layouts] to toggle focus between application windows.  I don't think it's possible to adjust the behaviour of kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇥/kbd so it meets your criteria.   <comment270599> The keyboard shortcut ⌘` doesn't switch to other spaces, so that doesn't work. <comment270610> You are right. What about ⌘↓ to show available application windows and then ← ENTER or → ENTER to switch to the one you need? <comment344865> I would love to have something like this.
