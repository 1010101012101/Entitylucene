What application is using a particular file? <body> I have some FileMaker databases being served for dev purposes and I keep bumping into occurrences where the database/file is locked and I can't make changes to it.    strongHow can I determine what application is touching/using this file so I can kill it?/strong   <answer67078> Have you tried using the terminal command     $ lsof 'Filename'   For a more detailed look at the file use  precode$ lsof | grep -f 'Filename' /code/pre  Should give you the command that is using it and also the PID of that file  <answer67204> Try adding sudo.  I set up a similar setup with the same file name, it would only appear if the file was open somewhere in a application. It didn't show up until I added the sudo tough.  precodesudo lsof | grep /path/to/file/Data.fmp12 /code/pre  <comment79194> The file is named Data.fmp12, so when I cd into that directory and run lsof 'Data.fmp12', the terminal pauses a moment and then just displays another blank command prompt <comment164076> [lsof without sudo may **not** produce the required output](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/76305/8546).
