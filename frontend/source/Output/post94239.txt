Missing library file: libSM.6.dylib <body> When executing an application I receive the following error:  precode./WordMaker WordMaker_BatchConfig.moos dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/local/lib/libSM.6.dylib   Referenced from: /Users/josh/Desktop/FabMapV2_MacOSX/bin/./WordMaker   Reason: image not found /code/pre  It appears that this library file relates to X11, which I have installed (i.e. XQuartz), however it is located at /usr/X11/lib/.  How do I fix this problem? Do I simply create a symbolic link to it or is there a better way / something that I am missing?  I am running OS X 10.8.4.  <answer94249> As the library is in /opt/local this probably means that the WordMaker executable was compiled using Macports libraries. So you need to install the libSM library via Macports like this.  precodesudo port install xorg-libsm /code/pre
