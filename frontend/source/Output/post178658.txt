Missing contacts on iPhone 4s <body> I have notice that some, not all, of my contacts are missing on my iPhone 4s.  I have done no upgrading, or downloading, or anything.  I'm thinking of deleting contacts from the device to see if icloud will restore them. Or should I be trying something else ?  <comment211649> From the contacts app, click "group" in the upper left and see if by chance you have more than one contact group, and one of them isn't selected.
