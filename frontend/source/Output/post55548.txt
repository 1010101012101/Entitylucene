Seeking small bluetooth keyboard with Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys <body> Seeking small bluetooth keyboard with Home/End/PageUp/PageDown keys that has same "feel" as Apple wireless keyboard.  Found these:  ol likeyboard1 (Apple-copy-cat silver, which I like)/li likeyboard2 (regular black, not as aesthetically pleasing)/li /ol  Any experience with the keystroke quality/feel (for above or other offerings)?  Compared to the Apple wireless/bluetooth keyboard?  How about bluetooth-connection quality to a MacBook Pro/Air?  Love the keystroke feel + overall design/aesthetics of aforementioned Apple wireless keyboard--but it doesn't have the aforementioned keys, which I need to be in my comfort zone in "Microsoft Excel power user" mode, among a few other things.  Yes, am aware of key remapping, but too cumbersome and hard for muscle-memory to remember.  <answer55557> The fn key + up/down/left/right arrows give you that functionality on the Apple keyboard. Earlier iterations of Apple keyboards were labeled as such but it still works on the newer unlabeled ones.  <comment63789> Thx.  And yes, familiar with these mappings.  But said mappings are both hard for my "muscle memory" to remember and are often not consistent across operational/application context (eg, operate diff from one app to the next).  Thus explicit home/end/pgup/pgdn keys strongly preferred.
