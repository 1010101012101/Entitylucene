Mac shows desktop without menu bar or Dock after updating Snow Leopard <body> During a system update on my MacBook (Mac OS X 10.6.8) it restarted and during the restart I have got a screen where it looks like the homepage but doesn't have the menu bar at the top or the Dock at the bottom and it would make a noise when I pressed the screen. Apple Support had me verifying stuff on the Disk Utility then it cut off. Can anyone help me? I can't download anything till this is sorted.  <answer177820> A few of things for you to try...  First, try starting in strongSafe Boot/strong by holding the strongShift/strong key when you hear the startup chime. If you manage to successfully boot in this way and you can access the internet, download and install OS X 10.6.8 Combo Update V1.1. Restart and see what happens...  If that doesn't work - and you have the original discs that shipped with your Mac - start your Mac from disc 1, strongOS X Install Disc/strong. Once it has started up find strongDisk Utility/strong from the menu bar and select strongRepair Disk/strong. When that has done select strongRepair Permissions/strong. Finally, restart and see what happens...  If you installed from a retail copy of 10.6, follow the same steps above.  If you don't have the original discs, start your Mac and hold strongcommand + S/strong to boot into single user mode. When it has booted you will see a command prompt, type in code/sbin/fsck â€“fy/code, press the strongEnter/strong key when done. A disk check will then be performed. When that's finished, type codeshutdown -r now/code at the command prompt. Wait for it to restart and see what happens...  <comment210442> Can you upload a picture of what's currently on your screen? <comment211885> Hi I am also experiencing the same problem and have followed all your instructions. Unfortunately I'm still experiencing the same problems. Do you think a complete system reinstall is necessary to fix this? Also, if that is the case is there a way to backup data on the same hard-drive before re-installing the OS? Thank you!
