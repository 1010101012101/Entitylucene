Audio output via USB suddenly stops working <body> I am using a MacBook Pro Late 2014 with Mac OS X 10.11.1 and an i-Tec USB-Dock. I also use the USB-Dock for audio output via external speakers. Sometimes, I was not able to recognize any pattern here, the sound output of the external speakers stops working. I am not able to reproduce the problem yet. Any hints on how to debug such a problem?  I'm quite inexperienced in Mac OS X debugging, but I have a strong Linux background, so command line stuff won't be a problem for me.  Thanks in advance Christian   <comment262263> What OS? I had similar issues with 10.11.0 that went away with 10.11.1 The 'fix' was System Prefs  Sound, change output to something else then back again. Crude, but effective. <comment262292> I'm on OS X 10.11.1 as well. Will try your solution the next time it happens
