iPhone 7 â€” Antenna stripes change their color <body> I've bought my iPhone 7 September 16th and noticed today a change in color of the antenna stripes - they are getting blueish:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EAu3N.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I always wear it in my jeans pocket without any case or sleeve.  Is there something I can do to clean the stripes?   <answer267040> I haven't tried it on an iPhone, but I'd bet melamine foam would work.  <answer267386> Well, a very white and very soft eraser (Staedtler Mars Plastic) did the job: there are almost no indigo stains on antenna stripes and no scratches on the phone at all after gently erasing for few minutes.  <comment334981> But you know what melamine foam is an abrasive like sandpaper? <comment334982> Yep, that's how it works. <comment335073> "Don't use window cleaners, household cleaners, compressed air, aerosol sprays, solvents, ammonia, or **abrasives** to clean your iPhone." https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht207123
