How to release mouse capture in VirtualBox? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5GjVZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm on my MacbookPro and using TeamViewer for remote access to my 2k3 Server. On this server I installed VirtualBox to create a virtual machine. But now I stuck at this screen and no more can use my mouse.  How can I release the mouse capture?  <answer168293> Press kbdControl/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd at the same time to release the mouse from the VirtualBox window.  <answer212718> You need to press "host key" which is written in right bottom corner of  VirtualBox window.   Looking at your screenshot its kbdstrongRight Ctrl/strong/kbd.     Its not default Mac kbdCommand ⌘/kbd because you are running VirtualBox on Windows host, which you are accessing using TeamViewer.   See virtualBox manual: link  <answer294642> You could also try triggering Sticky Keys (Press Shift repeatedly) that will pop you back to windows control. click no on the Sticky keys popup before you click back into virtual box (You can't trigger sticky keys if the pop up is open).  <comment197960> I tried it several times but had no luck. I found a solution for my problem: quit Teamviewer then login again , and I had my cursor back.
