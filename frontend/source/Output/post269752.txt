Make keychain prompt for password once? <body> To increase the security on my Mac I've set a password for my session keychain. This one gets locked after 5 minutes of inactivity. The issue I have is when I startup my Mac is that the password gets asked 5 or more times for separated programs.br Is their a way to make macOs Sierra just ask the password once, unlock the keychain for all other programs and lock keychain again after 5 minutes of inactivity?
