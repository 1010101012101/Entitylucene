How to share Family calendar with non-family member? <body> I have set up our family with iCloud, using iCloud Family Sharing.  Currently, myself and my husband define our Family and use our Family calendar for household events.   I also have a work iCloud account and would like to be able to subscribe to my home Family calendar from my work account so that I can see family events on my work calendar.  Is this possible, and if so, how can it be done (without adding my work account as a family member)?  <answer176283> You can share a Calendar with anyone in your contacts list…  Right click the calendar in the list on the left  Sharing Settings…  Start to type the name &amp; select from matching contacts   As I recall [it's been a long time since I set mine up], they must have an iCloud account to be able to actually use it, so you'd add their mac.com, me.com or iCloud.com address.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CFzt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268204> Since macOS &amp; iOS can handle multiple iCloud accounts, you can just add your personal iCloud account to your work Mac or iPhone in addition to the work account.   You may consider to turn all other iCloud options except the calendar off in order to limit the chances of mixing them up or bringing your personal email to your work Mac.  <comment208074> is it a Google calendar ? <comment208079> @Buscar No, it's an iCloud calendar. <comment208288> Thank you, but that doesn't work for the Family calendar (the calendar that Apple creates when you start doing Family Sharing).  It just shows an uneditable list of Family members sharing that calendar. <comment208290> AH, yes - I never noticed. In that case you'd probably be better off just making a new regular calendar & sharing that - just like my G&J Shared above, which was set up long before Family Sharing came along & is still the one we use for most things, the Family one is probably still empty ;) <comment300160> Did you ever find a solution here? I'm struggling with this now. <comment300303> @JimMeyer: No, I never did....
