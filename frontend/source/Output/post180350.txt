How do i get full capacity from Fusion drive on vmWare ESXi 6.0 Mac Mini 7,1 <body> I managed to install the free vmWare ESXi 6.0 hypervisor on a Mac Mini 7,1. It's running rather nicely from a USB memory.  The mini has a 2TB Fusion drive. My problem is that i can only get the 106 GB SSD drive to show for datastorage, not the remaining spinning platter capacity. Going to codeConfiguration -&gt; Storage -&gt; Add storage/code will not discover any more disk (as won't connecting a USB3 HDD to the mac, but that doesn't quite surprise me).  What should i do to get all the disk capacity to use?  <answer181571> Install the custom VIB from virtuallyGhetto.com.  <answer251924> The ESXi 6.0.0 update 2 solves this problem. The Fusion disk is recognised as two separate disks (which they in fact are). With that, i now have two datastores, one on the SSD and another one on the HDD.  What i usually do is install the guests on small virtual disks on the SSD datastore and give them a larger chunk on the HDD datastore. I've also successfully used Linux LVM to extend partitions on the SSD to "continue" to the HDD, but that's for another StackExchange question.  <comment214190> Did you check it even understands what Fusion is? Windows doesn't.
