How to turn off icloud photos and download the photos to iphone <body> I'm trying to download all of the photos off of iCloud and onto my phone. I have gone onto Settings-iCloud-photos-Download and Keep Originals, but it doesn't seem to have downloaded any of them. I tried turning off iCloud photo library, but, in the warning, it tells me that 411 photos(all of them) haven't been downloaded. Does anyone know of a way to download them to the phone?  <comment288889> I could take several hours to download everything.  If you have several videos, all in HD, that could take hours just for that.
