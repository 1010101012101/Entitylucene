-d option for split is illegal on OS X 10.9 <body> I have bash script that works on Ubuntu but for OS X 10.9 i get the  error for split command:  precodesplit -b 1000000 -a 3 -d $F $F &amp;&amp; rm $F || { echo "Error: 'split' command not installed" ; exit 1 ; }  split: illegal option -- d . /code/pre  According to the split man page, code-d/code is  precode   -d, --numeric-suffixes           use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic /code/pre  Is there workaround for this?  <answer138788> The GNU version of split is different to the OS X version of split.  OS X is based on BSD Unix, and Linux (often referred to as GNU/Linux) uses the GNU toolset.  The GNU version of split is part of the coreutils, and the good news is that these are available in MacPorts. If you have MacPorts installed, you can install the strongcoreutils/strong port using the command:  precodesudo port install coreutils /code/pre  This installs the GNU core utilities (including split) with a codeg/code prefix, so you call split using the command codegsplit/code.  <comment163727> While I know it is possible to install the coreutils with the default names, I would never recommend it since all scripts written for OS X assume that the BSD tools have the 'original' names. <comment208094> The coreutils are also available via homebrew (also with a 'g' prefix): `brew install coreutils`
