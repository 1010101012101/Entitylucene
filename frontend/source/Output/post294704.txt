How to scroll in developer tool in chrome 60? <body> OS: macOS Sierra v 10.12.5 Chrome v 60  Recently stuck in chrome; unable to see the complete console information as there is no way to scroll up in attached Developer Tool. Even when I detach the Developer Tool from the window but scrollbar flash for a while, there is no way to scroll up/down. Already tried codeCmd + 0/code and codeUp/Down Arrow/code  but no success.  someone, please suggest how to see the console to scroll up within developer tool.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhV0H.jpg" alt="no scrollbar in developer tool"
