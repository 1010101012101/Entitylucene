Connect to OpenVPN - /etc/resolv.conf gets edited - MacBook Pro - El Capitan <body> When I connect to my office network via OpenVPN, my code/etc/resolv.conf/code gets overwritten and changes my emhostname/em as well. I guess it is assigning a emhostname/em randomly picked by the DHCP/DNS.   Since it is editing my emresolv.conf/em file I am unable to access my local network.  How to overcome this?
