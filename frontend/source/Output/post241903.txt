Can I downgrade my iOS version to 7.x? <body> Can I downgrade my iOS to 7.x? I need to do it for app testing.  <answer241906> Due security reasons, there is no method to downgrade.  <answer241911> Apple has full control what releases are available to install and downgrade. iOS 7 is not downgrade able unless you jailbreak your iPhone (not recommended!).   You can check if Apple still allows to roll-back your previous iOS version at IPSW . Click on your device and see what versions are green (allowed by Apple) to install.  <comment297315> In the past I think there is. Is this a new thing by Apple? <comment297316> You can downgrade from beta versions. But, with every new release of the system, apple stop signing previous releases, so those can't be installed.
