Where is file metadata stored in Mac OS X? <body> It used to be stored in a resource fork, but I've tried listing the resource forks for files on my computer, and they don't seem to have resource forks.  Where is the metadata stored now?  Like where is it in the filesystem?  How can I access it so I can perform a backup and restore of just the metadata or part of the metadata?  <comment270382> The filesystem itself records the metadata in several places unfortunately for someone looking for an atomic file holding it all. What specifically would restoring the metadata look like? At a fine enough detail, things like permissions, file access times and other are hard coded, restricted so it also depends on what specific version of OS X you are running...
