Can't enable password protection in Notes app <body> I'm following the advice here where I want go to settings and set a password. If I do this I get     strongUpdate Notes/strongbr   For the configuration of the password protection open "Notes" and update your notes. (emtranlated/em)   What should I do here?  iOS 9.3.2 is installed. Also the is no emlock note/em option if I tap the emshare/em button.  <answer245604> On one of my updates I didn't switched to the new emNotes/em system, where you can draw and so on (because of incompatibilities). Now I want to switch:  ol liOpen emNotes/em app./li liGo back to folder/li liTap the emupdate/em button (on the top left, same height as iCloud)/li liTap on emupdate now/em/li liIt takes some time and you see the number of notes he "converted"/li liStyling is differently. Now you can set your password./li /ol  Be careful when updating because there are some incompatibilities (MacBook must have OS X El Capitan, problems with multiple iCloud accounts on the same phone, ...). Don't know why Apple didn't make it work with both versions.  <comment302790> Your iOS device must have version 9.3 of iOS installed. Can you verify this? <comment302792> yeah 9.3.2. is installed. <comment302793> Mmm what happens if you open Notes, create a new note and then set a password using the Share button? (When you after this go back to Settings  Notes  Password) <comment302794> If I tap the share button there is no *lock note* button .. <comment302796> Mmm what about reinstalling the Update? Make a backup, and restore your iPhone, or maybe, if you wish, you may try to reset all the settings only, this won't impact your Apps data though <comment302797> Oh, just to be sure: did you try to turn it off and on again? :) <comment302818> Thanks for your help. I found the solution.
