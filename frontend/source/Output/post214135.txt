Iphone 5 blurred screen <body> I have a  iPhone 5 almost 2 years old (out of warranty), and suddenly the screen has been showing blurred duplicates/shadows.  Have done a factory-reset in vain. The screen is OK on startup, but a few minutes later the blurring starts.  Any ideas  or has anyone faced a similar problem ? Is it a hardware issue and the screen has to be replaced   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HGNXt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks for any pointers  Art  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZIo1Q.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment258482> Has this been dropped? Submerged in water? Anything like that? <comment258485> It was a dropped once  a  month back <comment298122> That is some trippy sh*t... What did you end up doing about it
