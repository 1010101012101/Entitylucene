How to figure out what a keyboard shortcut is set to <body> For example, I would like to know what Shift-F1 does.   I've looked in the keyboard shortcuts section and couldn't find anything.   Is there a way I can look it up? Either on my Mac, or some reference table somewhere?  I notice in the terminal, it just makes a beep sound, and in safari it does nothing at all.  the reason for it is I want to use this shortcut when I ssh into a linux machine to control byobu.  <answer257882> Is this app specific or in finder? If its finder, I dont see a shift+f1 shortcut, only control+f1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v64c9.png" alt="enter image description here"
