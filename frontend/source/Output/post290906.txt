Power Mac G4 can't connect to internet <body> I have a Power Mac G4 and I'm trying to connect to the internet. I tried to connect the Ethernet cable to the modem (the other side was in the computer).   I tried to connect it automatically (I chose the "I connect to my Local Area Network (LAN)" option). It failed to automatically connect, so I had to put in the IP address, subnet mask, and router address information. I did and it said "Unable to establish a network connection".   I tried every option except AirPort since I don't have it. How do I connect to the internet? I really want my Mac to work! It's a Mac OS X Version 10.4.11  <comment367267> Please add the manufacturer/name of the modem!
