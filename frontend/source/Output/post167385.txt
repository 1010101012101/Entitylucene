Create a partition with Maverick <body> I am not able to create a third partition with Maverick.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6wtXh.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can't press the + button  <comment196245> currently you have the whole disk reserved for 2 partitions. To make space reduce the size of the Macintosh HD. <comment196255> you are not logged in as administrator? <comment196321> I am logged in as administrator. @Buscarì›ƒ I can't reduce it. I updated to Yosemite and I still have the same problem. <comment196350> Macintosh hd is probably a core storage volume, you have to convert it back to HFS+ format before resizing. I don't have my MacBook to give your the exact command but I'm sure a google search will return everything you need to know.
