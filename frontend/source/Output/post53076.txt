What is the Numbers keyboard shortcut to get in the formula bar of a cell? <body> I am looking for a keyboard shortcut in Numbers to edit the current cell via the emformula bar/em (if that is the right word). Screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hsyw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please note, I am not looking for this answer. That is how to put your cursor in the current cell, and not the formula bar.  Thanks.
