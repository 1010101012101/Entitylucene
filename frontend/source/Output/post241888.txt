Show tracked changes by date in Word 2011? <body> How can I show the edits done on a particular day?   Sometimes I want to check the starting/stopping times on a day, but there seems to be no way to list the edits in chronological order or search for, say, May 1st. Any help would be much appreciated.  <comment297318> I don't know about word, but [google docs has a revision history, which updates every single time the document is saved](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en). It shows the date and time of each change.
