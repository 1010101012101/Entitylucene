Apple Music and gift cards <body> I'm in a country where Apple Music is not available (Morocco) and I have an apple ID that I use with my all of my iDevices. Will I be able to use Apple Music using a gift card (25$ one)?   Also, what about the free, 3 month trial? Will I lose the 25$ or they will just use the gift card to verify the account?   <answer194342> According to Apple, Apple music isn't available in Morocco, meaning that even is you use a gift card that you can't use it.  Other then that, you need to use a credit card to even use the 3 month free trial.  You can see the available countrys that Apple music is available in here.
