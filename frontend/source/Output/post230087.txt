No version model of Macbook in 'About This Mac' section <body> What does it mean if there is no version model?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1W4B1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is it normal? I expect the money year after the words "MacBook Air" similar to this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDPj7.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to buy this particular Mac, should I worry about it?  <answer230095> It's not normal, but it might be nothing. The next reinstall of the OS or an update might populate that field for you.  As far as I can tell, some time during installation the OS checks with Apple and downloads a localized string to represent the hardware. Since you're not US - perhaps there was an outage or an error localizing the string.  Unless there's other cause for concern - you could try reinstalling the OS - choose US location and language to see if that's related. Try looking up the serial number using the answer of the last link (The Stack Overflow question).  http://support-sp.apple.com/sp/product?cc=G940&amp;lang=en_US  In your case, that's reported as a strongMacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015)/strong and you could change the language code to get a localized version.  Some other reading on serial numbers and the OS:  ul liWhat causes a Mac to lose its serial number?/li liHow can I find the serial number on a mac programmatically from the terminal?/li lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8058151/how-does-system-profiler-retrieve-the-full-mac-hardware-identifier/li /ul  <answer230266> Did I understand correctly that you want the Mac Model identifier? It is found in the hardware overview. That is one levelbdown from your image.
