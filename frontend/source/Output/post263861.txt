macOS Enrolment - Devices only being added as placeholders <body> We have an office of about 15 Mac computers, and I'm looking to setup a Mac Mini server, to centralise the management of these devices. I've setup the Mac Mini server with the Server app and enabled both the emOpen Directory/em and emProfile Manager/em roles.  I've enabled the option to emsign configuration profiles/em and selected the emSigning Certificate/em certificate.  In the profile manager, I've created an enrollment profile and unticked the emrestrict use to devices with placeholders/em option.  On the computer that I want to join, I've first installed the emtrust profile/em and then I've run the enrollment profile to join the computer.  The computer shows up under the emusage/em as having joined the profile, and under devices, it's successfully adding the device (including the Serial Number and Computer Name), but it's only adding it as a placeholder.  I can't seem to find anyone who is in a similar situation than me, but I should add the following:  ul liWe use a managed service, and don't have access to our firewall rules, so I'm not sure if we need to make any exceptions/li liNothing is showing up under activity (active or completed tasks)/li liOur financials are handled by our parent company, so there is no way for me to get a DUNS number, so therefore no way for me to enroll in the device enrollment program./li /ul  Is there anything I can do to centralise the management of my computers without having a DUNS number and/or making firewall changes?
