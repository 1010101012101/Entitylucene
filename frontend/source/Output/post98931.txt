Use Quicklook to see the Content of .JSON files? <body> Currently, I can use the space bar to preview a number of files such as .txt, .css, .html etc in Quick Look.  I cannot, however, see the actual contents of a .json file.  Is there any possible way to see the contents of .json files through space bar preview in finder? (I'm Using OSX 10.8.4)  <answer98934> Download a release of strongqlstephen/strong from Github, and load it into the /Library/Quicklook or ~/Library/QuickLook folder. Then, restart the Dock.  I use this all the time when previewing JSON files, and it works great.  <answer167043> also installable via   precodebrew cask install qlstephen /code/pre  <answer221797> You can use the quicklook-json plugin. If you want to install it via homebrew, run  precodebrew cask install quicklook-json /code/pre  which requires a running  precodebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask /code/pre  if you never did that before.  <answer246715> Run codebrew cask install quicklook-json/code to Preview JSON files.  There are bunch of other usefull here, check following awesome list https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins  Or install with following   precodebrew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask brew cask install qlcolorcode qlstephen qlmarkdown quicklook-json qlprettypatch brew cask install quicklook-csv betterzipql qlimagesize webpquicklook suspicious-package /code/pre  <comment116264> Worked perfectly.  Thanks. One thing to add for terminal n008s like myself, restart the dock with the command "killall Dock". <comment255864> I had to first `brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask`.  Works great! <comment304404> one of the best links ever... :)  wish I had some spare points to give <comment304416> @mlo55 just enjoy the quick looks ! <comment342532> Actually, vanilla brew search quicklook only returns quicklook-json as related to Json.
