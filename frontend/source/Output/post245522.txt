Unable to show hidden files on Mac <body> I just received a new MacBook, running OS X El Capitan 10.11.5, from my new employer and I am unable to force hidden files to show in Finder.  This is my fourth MacBook, and in the past I have always used codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code to show hidden files; however, on my new Mac, this is not showing the hidden files. I also tried codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code but still cannot see hidden files in Terminal or in Finder.  I restarted my computer, but that didn't solve my issue either.  Any ideas on how to show my Mac's hidden files?  <answer245548> Try this:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true; killall Finder /code/pre  This sets AppleShowAllFiles to true which tells Finder to show all file. Note the -bool part, that tells will make sure you are setting a Boolean to it instead of string, integer etc. Finally it restarts Finder.  <answer245551> After you run the codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code command,  hold the 'option/alt' key, then right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch.  <comment302743> Welcome to Ask Different.
