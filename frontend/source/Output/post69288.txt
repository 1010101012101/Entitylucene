Getting the space key to act like the return key <body> I come from a Windows background and I have gotten into the habit of hitting the Space key every time there's a popup on my screen that I want to close.  But on the Mac, it doesn't do anything, but hitting Return does.  Does anyone  know how I can get Mac to let the space key act like the Return key on modal dialogs?  I tried to find something in the Keyboard preferences but don't see anything related to popups.  <answer69305> Press kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF7/kbd to enable Full Keyboard Access. This setting is also available in the System Preferences under the Keyboard preference pane:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r8FXK.png" alt="enter image description here"  By selecting 'All controls', you can kbdtab/kbd around keyboard focus between the various widgets in dialog boxes, including buttons like strongOK/strong or strongCancel/strong. It's slightly different from Windows, in that kbdreturn/kbd is like pressing the strongfully highlighted/strong button, while kbdspace/kbd is like pressing the strongselected / outlined/strong button.  This image shows the difference between the two:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/11qir.png" alt="enter image description here"  In this example, the strongCancel/strong button has focus (from tabbing) while strongOK/strong is the default. So pressing kbdspace/kbd would select strongCancel/strong, while kbdreturn/kbd would select strongOK/strong.  And for completeness, this one can be accepted by either kbdspace/kbd or kbdreturn/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ehMr.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's worth noting that some OS X dialog boxes (I've noticed this especially with dialogs asking whether it's OK to overwrite a file) will come up with, for example, strongDon't Overwrite/strong as the default for kbdreturn/kbd, and strongDo Overwrite/strong as the focused item for kbdspace/kbd. This makes it a single key either way to do what you want, but you need to be sure you've got the right one!  <comment80522> You could try a key remapping program. At lifehacker (http://lifehacker.com/5882684/the-best-keyboard-remapper-for-mac-os-x) the KeyRemap4MacBook (http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/) is recommended. I've not tried it, but it might work for you. <comment80538> i think the issue is not that space needs to be return, but that space should be able to interact with dialog boxes <comment80542> Awesome! This is precisely THE way to get that functionality. <comment81201> Can we improve things to get you to indicate which answer works to solve your question? <comment81284> Unfortunately none of the proposed solutions does exactly what I asked for, but I have to assume that getting the exact functionality won't be possible at this point in time. <comment81285> Selecting this answer, but note that it is not the exact behavior of Windows since I do have to tab around before I can hit the space, where as in Windows tab was typically not necessary since the focus was usually on the main button of interest (like OK or Save).  But I have a feeling this is the closest we can get. <comment81336> It sounds like you're after the Windows method *because* its the Windows method. With most things Mac vs Windows, the same will be achievable with much the same efficiency, but you'll need to 'Think Different' as they say. The interface or method will be a little different, and if you try to make one *just* like the other, you'll be disappointed. If you can manage to drop the expectations of one behaving exactly like the other (and it goes both ways!) then you'll find efficient, but slightly different, ways of working on either system. <comment97129> The Windows method (of invoking selected button on Enter) is also how things behave on the Web and Linux. So it's not just the Windows method. If one could swap the behaviors of 'Enter' and 'Space' on the Mac, that would be really helpful. <comment199567> You don't see anything... because what you call "popups" are *dialogs*.
