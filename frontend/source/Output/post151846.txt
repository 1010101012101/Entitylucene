How do I Launch an Applescript with a Hotkey Without Automator? <body> I'm running Yosemite and looking to launch Terminal with a keypress in any application. One solution was creating a Service in Automator that launched terminal and assigning a key to it in System Preferences. However there is an annoying delay before launching Automator services, I'd like something immediate. Is there a way to do as such, preferably without installing software that runs in the background?  <answer186075> I found Automator's "Launch Application" action to be as quick as anything else, and the only way to do this without third party software.  BetterTouchTool is a free application that can be used to launch applications using hotkeys.  iTerm 2 is a Terminal.app replacement that can be shown/hidden using a hotkey (if it's running).
