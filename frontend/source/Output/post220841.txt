Yosemite Single User Mode <body> Does strongem"Single User Mode"/em/strong still work, empost/em  strongemv10.10.x/em/strong em?/embr I tried the following instructions, without success:    hr  h2OS X Yosemite: Start up in single-user mode/h2     To troubleshoot your computer’s startup sequence using only UNIX commands, start up in single-user mode. You should do this only if you’re comfortable with UNIX.       Choose  Apple menu  Restart, or press the power button if your Mac is turned off.      Press kbd⌘ command/kbd+kbds/kbd as your Mac starts up.      The screen is black with standard white text. You can now run the UNIX commands that you want.      In single-user mode, not all OS X functions are available. To use the standard OS X interface or other high-level aspects of OS X, you need to start up in the standard mode.

You can check by starting with the Option key down, and see if it prompts for the password.
