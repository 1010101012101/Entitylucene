How do I sync iCloud iWork documents with Lion? <body> I have been using my iPad with Numbers and would like to be able to just open them up on my Mac with Lion. I can not figure out how to connect/sync to iCloud documents. I have checked iCloud documents for syncing, but my documents don't appear on my Mac.  I have even set up my mobile documents folder on the desktop. I can drag files to the iCloud that way, but then I can not open them from that folder. Frustrating.   <answer37365> Unfortunately, Macintosh does not (yet) support complete iCloud synchronization for documents. We can only hope that Apple will implement this at some point soon.  In the mean time, go to http://www.icloud.com/ and sign in. You can drag documents to and from the appropriate section on your computer, and it'll work with your iPad. There's still another bug, which involves Mac  Mac syncing, but as long as you just do iPad  Mac or Mac  iPad, it'll work fine. :)  Also, there is a folder located at code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code which contains your iCloud-enabled apps' data. This includes the iWork suite, but unfortunately iWork documents aren't saved as the normal filetypes (e.g. ".pages"), so they can't be opened on their own.  <answer63026> The following works on Lion 10.7.4:  Warning! If you don't know what you are doing, then you probably shouldn't be doing this. You take all responsibility for nuking your own iCloud data.  ul liAs usual, make sure you have iCloud setup for your user and enable Documents &amp; Data sync./li /ul  Execute next steps from Terminal (code/Applications/Utilities/Terminal/code):  ul lirun: codesudo nano /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist/code - change codeRunAtLoad/code from codefalse/code to codetrue/code/li lirun: codedefaults write com.apple.ubd kUBSyncEnabledKey -bool true/code/li /ul  At this point, ubd needs to be restarted..  ul lirun: codelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist/code/li lirun: codelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.ubd.plist/code/li /ul  now code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code should be synced up.  If for some reason it's still not syncing after step 4, try logging out and back in.  <comment46881> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30450/once-ios-files-are-backed-up-to-icloud-can-you-access-them-programmatically <comment46945> Update to this: the upcoming OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) sounds like [it will add the desired capability to iWork](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#icloud) et. al. <comment46982> Thats awesome! Can't wait. Thanks, @djacobson! <comment73398> Confirmed this works. <comment88905> Yep, that worked! Thanks!
