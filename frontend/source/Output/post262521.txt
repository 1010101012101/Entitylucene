Mail.app on macOS always recommends the wrong contact suggesting my VIPs as second and third option <body> Unfortunately both my wife and my doctor are called Sophie, and every time I write "soph" into the To: field of a new email, Mail.app recommends my doctor even though I hardly ever email her. This feels like a bug in the algorithm or is there a way I should be controlling/configuring this?
