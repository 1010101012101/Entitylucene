How do I stop my iPad from wrongly auto correcting my name? <body> When I set up my iPad last year I entered my name correctly. The iPad wrongly autocorrected it to Alien. Now anyone who gets an email from me is informed its from Alien. Irritating. I don't want to turn off autocorrect though as its useful.  <answer120771> I'm not sure where you entered your name incorrectly.  strongIf your name is entered incorrectly as a contact then:/strong  ol liClick on codeContacts/code/li liScroll down until you see 'Alien'/li liClick on the contact/li liClick codeEdit/code/li liChange the name/li /ol  strongIf you entered your name incorrectly only in your email account settings:/strong  ol liGo to codeSettings/code  codeMail, Contacts, Calendars/code/li liIn the codeACCOUNTS/code section, click on the account that has the incorrect information (e.g. codeGmail/code)/li liClick on codeAccount/code/li liChange the codeName/code associated with that email account./li /ol  <answer120778> Here's how to change your name:  ol liOpen the Contacts app /li liScroll to your name /li liClick edit/li liEdit your name/li /ol  This should fix your autocorrect issue.  <answer120816> Do you mean that when you type 'Aileen' it is always autocorrected to 'Alien'?  My favourite way to fix this is to define a shortcut as the result of a shortcut is never autocorrected.  Go to Settings  General  Keyboards and "Add New Shortcut..." Set the "Phrase" to 'Aileen ' and make the shortcut something uncommon - I use ';' followed by a letter - so choose ';a' as a shortcut.  Now when you want to type your name then type ';a' and it will be replaced with "Aileen" and never corrected to anything else. As a benefit it is faster to type.  <comment140822> Check your contacts. Are you there under 'Alien'? <comment140932> Based on the vague wording of the question, this is a very valid answer. Not sure why this was downvoted. <comment141624> Did any of the answers below help? If so, please choose an answer and close the question.
