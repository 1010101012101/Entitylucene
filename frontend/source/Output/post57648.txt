How can I set Last Modified Date of file after using HandbrakeCLI to convert a file? <body> Running this on OS X Lion.  I'm batch converting several hundred home movies using Handbrake CLI.  I'd like to strongset the last modified date and created date to that original file./strong  I'm using the following script:  precodefor f in "$@"; do   base=${f%.*}   extension=${f##*.}   newfile=${base}.m4v   echo Converting \"$f\" to \"$newfile\"   /Applications/HandBrakeCLI  -e x264 -b 4000 -a 1 -E faac -B 160 -R 48 -6 dpl2 -f mp4 --crop 0:0:0:0  -x level=40:ref=2:mixed-refs:bframes=3:weightb:subme=9:direct=auto:b-pyramid:me=umh:analyse=all:no-fast-pskip:filter=-2,-1 -i "$f" -o "$newfile"     done /code/pre  I execute this script by running:  precodefind . -name "*.avi" -print0 | xargs -0 hbapple.sh /code/pre  Does anyone have thoughts on how I can set the last modified and creation time of the original file to that of the $newfile?   If I don't figure out how to do this I will have a difficult time knowing when these videos were actually created.    I appreciate any help or pointers  <answer57656> The modification date can be set with  precodetouch -m -t 201207010742 whatever.m4v /code/pre  AFAIK the creation/birth date can't be modified.  To set the modification date based on the creation date of another file you can use codestat/code:  precodetouch -m -t $(stat -f %SB -t %Y%m%d%H%M original-file.mov) new-file-m4v /code/pre  hr  To apply this to your script, use something like  precodefor f in "$@"   do      olddate=$(stat -f %SB -t %Y%m%d%H%M "$f")      base=${f%.*}      extension=${f##*.}      newfile=${base}.m4v      echo Converting \"$f\" to \"$newfile\"      /Applications/HandBrakeCLI  -e x264 -b 4000 -a 1 -E faac -B 160 -R 48 -6 dpl2 -f mp4 --crop 0:0:0:0  -x level=40:ref=2:mixed-refs:bframes=3:weightb:subme=9:direct=auto:b-pyramid:me=umh:analyse=all:no-fast-pskip:filter=-2,-1 -i "$f" -o "$newfile"      touch -m -t $olddate "$newfile"       done /code/pre  <comment66317> Thanks, any chance you can suggest how I get the original file date and store it in a variable and then pass it into the touch command? <comment66514> Thanks, but I don't think this will work (as written).  I need to first stat the file, then convert, then touch the file.  I'm not really great at UNIX scripting so I'm playing around with how to modifiy this.
