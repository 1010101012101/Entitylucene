Help finding out what Icon represents <body> I'm just looking for some help finding out what the below icon represents?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtGzT.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <answer122485> Reverse image searches with tineye.com and Google Search by Image return no matches. This is not a widely used image with a common meaning.  <comment142922> Where does this icon come from ? <comment142923> It was sent to me in a presentation but the owner of the presentation said it had been historically included and no one had questioned it before - it was included along with more standard social media icons if that's any help. Cheers <comment142925> This question appears to be off-topic because it is not related to Apple Software/Hardware. <comment142926> Ah yes my apologies on that - after combing the internet I then posted this question on a number of forums to spread the net wide as I thought it might be a system specific icon that was simply being incorrectly used in this case (e.g. some kind of app or software's icon rather than a social media icon) <comment142927> Thanks Graham, I too had found this and so many thanks for confirming my findings - I think it might be some weird outdated wifi icon and so I will be removing it but thanks for looking. Cheers
