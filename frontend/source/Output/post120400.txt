Spotlight button doesn't work (on click displays a sound instead) <body> It's a totally newbie question, but I started using Mac computers like a month ago and this is something I can't find on the internet. Sometimes (yeah not always and I can't even find out when it happens) when I want to click the spotlight button it displays sound and doesn't work (I use cmd + f instead, but it's pretty confusing). Could you tell me why is it like this?  P.S. The sound sounds like it was disabled or something.  <answer228738> Ok So I have the same problem since a while and I still haven't found any proper solution.  However there is one trick to open it anyway :  h2Trick/h2  kbdï£¿/kbd + kbdspace/kbd this while able it too.  <comment140424> Welcome, someone will be with you shortly :), we are users like you and have a private life to deal with as well.

Meanwhile provide as many details as you can Operating system, computer, including what have you tried so far. <comment140425> Spotlight shortcut is cmd+spacebar or whichever is selected in your spotlight settings. <comment140426> Wow! It started working. I mean when I pressed cmd + space it opened and then when I closed it the button started working again. Can you explain me this magic? <comment140429> It was always there :) using the right shortcut key combination just showed it.
