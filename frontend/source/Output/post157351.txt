How to set HTML-files icon to default? <body> I have a problem with icons in files. Particularly it's only HTML files. I uninstalled Coda 2 app (deleting all relevant info, also clear my cash) and continue to use Sublime Text 3. But I have this (see the screenshot below) and this icons are not updated as my .css or .js files do. How can I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FJ51v.png" alt="enter image description here"  Already try this from here:   precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  Nothing changes. Maybe because it's especially for OS X Mavericks and I have Yosemite...  <answer157786>  You could also try to run  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"coderm -r /var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.iconservices rm -r /var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.dock.iconcache rm -r ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.finder qlmanage -r sudo rm -r /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store /code/pre  and restart.  <answer162618> Nothing helped, until I uninstalled and re-installed OS.  <comment184987> possible duplicate of [The icons do not update in the Finder or Get Info Tab](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148141/the-icons-do-not-update-in-the-finder-or-get-info-tab) <comment184990> Already try it - not help, thanks anyway. The top is updated. <comment185000> Did you restart ? <comment185003> Yeah, sure I do.
