iPad putting spaces in customer number <body> When I enter my customer number to log into a website, my iPad puts spaces into it and I am unable to login. It can only be something to do with the iPad settings, since I have no problem logging in on my desktop.  <comment330279> Does it only occur with one web site or with all? Could auto-correct have some influence here? <comment330285> Can I ask which site you are logging in to? It sound to me like the developer of the site has set the field type to something your iPad is trying to comply with. Other browsers may simply be treating this field as plain text. <comment346778> It is the NS&I website. I have tried to contact them, but the person there did not know who to contact to rectify it.
