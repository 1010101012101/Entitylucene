How to download course collections from iTunesU in iTunes 12? <body> I have difficulty in downloading video content of course 'collection', those with notebook looking icon in iTunesU.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/87HSk.png" alt="subscribe"  As usual I click 'subscribe' button 1, but only the pdf files are downloaded. When I go to the course in iTunes (the local one, not the online store), only one button 'Settings' 2 shows up in the upper right corner, rather than tow, 'Old Materials' and 'Settings' as other 'non-collection' courses.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9NKo1.jpg" alt="settings"
