Markdown editor with edit and view mode <body> I'm looking for a OS X markdown (or similar) editor that has an edit and a view mode. I want to view the rendered document by default and have an edit mode to change the content. Just in the way most wikis work.  Day One uses edit/view modes but it doesn't let me edit arbitrary text files.  On iOS I found Trunk Notes.  I am not looking for an editor with a preview. I want to see either Markdown or rendering.  <answer100367> Haroopad, http://pad.haroopress.com It's great app for markdown.  <answer100369> I recommend Ulysses if you’re looking for editing and preview in one app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vrwB3.png" alt="Ulysses Screenshot"  However, I usually write with iA Writer and use Marked to preview them in Markdown. Use whichever you prefer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h7SzP.jpg" width="250"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/29HZF.jpg" width="350"  <answer100396> MOU app is also pretty good. It has side-by-side edit and preview windows, and is free-/donation-ware. (Not sure what you mean by render preview — actual HTML or PDF as would be output by Pandoc?)  <answer138666> I finally found an app. Write for Mac supports preview on opening.  <comment118136> I tried Ulysses yesterday and it was the best I've found so far. But it doesn't have a true view mode in the way Day One does. <comment118150> I think you can combine [Marked](http://markedapp.com) with your favorite text editor. You can assign shortcut in Marked to enter **Edit Mode** with pre-determined text editor. <comment118204> Something like Mou without the two panels. I see either the preview (default) or the markdown (edit mode). But not both at the same time. <comment118206> Interesting request. Sounds like the original Adobe Illustrator. In MOU, you can toggle the live preview with Command-Shift-I, but I don't think you can toggle the editing window on/off to just see the preview. I like having them side-by-side, but then my monitor is big enough to see each full size. Sounds like your best bet would be a Marked preview window on top of an editor window and switch between apps.
