What happened to my iChat account? <body> Having recently upgraded my machine to Mountain Lion, I realized that there is no iChat app anymore and that everything ended up into the Messages app. I've been using a code@mac.com/code account specifically to access iChat, so what happens to this account now? Has it become useless?  <answer78824> Nothing changes for accessing AIM chat using the new Messages app (that integrates iChat features with iMessage features).  Just go to Messages - Preferences - Accounts to be sure your @mac.com account is entered with a password and enabled for use.  <comment91129> Should I set it up as a new AIM account? <comment91135> It's not a new account, but you need to sign in if the app doesn't have your AIM information entered/configured. So yes - make a new account on the app, but don't tell the app to get a new AIM account from AIM for you.
