How to include secondary drives' files into 'All My Files' feature <body> I have a dual drive setup (SSD as boot, HDD for storage in my Mac). I would like to know how I can include files form my HDD into finders features like 'All My Files'  <answer95317> 'All My Files' is a Smart Folder, that is, a saved Spotlight search, named codemyDocuments.cannedSearch/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1CEEV.png" alt="enter image description here"  and located in code/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/code. You probably shouldn't modify it, as it is a system file.  However, you can create your own Smart Folder using 'All My Files' as a template:  ol liSelect 'All My Files' and click 'Show search criteria':  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GY1E.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liChoose 'This Mac' to search the entire computer:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TTS1G.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick Save and specify a name, for example 'All My Items Everywhere', and a location for your Smart Folder (the default in code~/Library/Saved Searches/code should be OK).  The Smart Folder will appear in the sidebar./li liSelect 'All My Items Everywhere', right click and arrange by kind:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qt6GL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  to get a similar output as 'All My Items':   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cHugC.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  The downside of creating your own Smart Folder is that you can't configure the Finder so that new windows display 'All My Items Everywhere'.
