Is there a Safari extension that closes duplicated tabs automatically? <body>    macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (It works fine on other OS)br   MadCatz R.A.T 7br   This error isn't related to web browser,br   Middle button click often raise multiple click events, tested on codeKarabiner-EventViewer/code   I'm looking for a safari extension that automatically closes duplicated tabs because my system has an error, web browsers open link multiple times when I open a link by clicking a link with middle wheel button.  I couldn't find a way to solve this error, but I can endure this annoying misbehavior with extensions like Clutture Free.  I like to have an extension that automatically closes duplicated tabs on Safari, works like Clutter Free on Chrome browser.  If you know something about it, please help!  <comment360585> Wouldn't it make more sense to get the switch fixed? <comment360592> I think it's not a hardware problem, maybe driver(kext?) or something.  I tried to find a way to fix that malfunction on macOS, but no luck. That's why I ask this question.  I can't find a way to solve this, but It's fine with extension like [Clutter Free](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clutter-free-prevent-dupl/iipjdmnoigaobkamfhnojmglcdbnfaaf)
