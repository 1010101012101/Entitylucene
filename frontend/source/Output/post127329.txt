AppleScript To Manipulate VLC <body> I want to do a script, that it can launch VLC player, and in VLC player "Open a file", then  "Select a folder", then click on "add" then "play" it. I think that Automator can't do this. But Applescript seems legit, right?  How to build an easy script, that I can save as an application then setup it to the startup folder?  Path : the folder in question code/Users/server_raagc/Copy/code  (I tried automator, then applescript, then terminal with a .plist then another automator combined with an applescript saved as application, all of this in a different way times 36.  My code :   precodeset workflowpath to "/Users/server_raagc/Desktop/FINAAAAAL - copie.workflow"  set qtdworkflowpath to quoted form of (POSIX path of workflowpath)  set command to "/usr/bin/automator " &amp; qtdworkflowpath  set output to do shell script command  /code/pre  Always an error. Or here trying to code another one. Same thing.  precode activate application "VLC"  tell application "System Events" keystroke "O" using command down  end tell  tell application "System Events" to tell process "VLC" click button "Parcourir..." of window 1 of window 2  end tell /code/pre  The automator Test: Maybe becauce one is an "Watch Me do"?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9l1Fy.jpg" alt="image desc" title="click to view full size"  <answer127331> This AppleScript will open the specified folder in VLC and begin to play the contents:  precodetell application "VLC"   OpenURL "file:///Users/grgarside/Desktop/test/"   play end tell /code/pre  <answer235245> open folder then run script      precodetell application "Finder" to set cwd to POSIX path of (insertion location as alias)  tell application "VLC"     OpenURL "file://" &amp; cwd &amp; ""     play end tell /code/pre  <comment149213> It's a great restart, but here the thing is i want to VLC to play a foler, when i do   `tell application "VLC" OpenURL "/Users/ruedifly/Desktop/SaintvPatrick/ Play  end tell`       Doesn't work for me, 'cause it's folder How can i do that ? <comment150374> For me on Snow Leopard running VLC 2.0.7 I had to add a second `play` to get it to start... Maybe my settings are messed up but the above solution works.
