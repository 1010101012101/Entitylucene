Is there an app that will convert a movie to an image sequence? <body> Does anyone know a mac app for converting a movie (.mov) to a series of images ? I know quicktime could do this in the olden days, but that features has been deleted.  <answer40341> Yup, you still can do it with Quicktime Player. Download it from here. I believe you can also install it from the Snow Leopard install disc. I'm not sure about the Lion install download.  Open the movie and click FileExport:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXzR0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then you can select Movie to Image Sequence:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CtR1u.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Set your destination folder and watch Quicktime Player do its magic.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HEYUg.jpg" alt="Exporting to image sequence"  <answer88438> There is an app called "movie2picture" in App Store.  <answer88470> You can also use ffmpeg:  precodeffmpeg -i input.mkv -r 0.05 image_sequence%06d.png /code/pre  -r 0.05 = 0.05 Hz = 3 images per minute. It sometimes includes a few extra frames from the start though. Without -r it saves every frame.   <comment45637> What a blessing! :D Thank you so much <comment45655> Yeah, no problem! That's what Ask Different exists for. <comment163759> It seems this functionality is no longer offered in the non-pro version of QuickTime? <comment177815> For those still looking for an app, I created one such app because QuickTime took away the functionality. If interested, you can download it from here: http://download.cnet.com/VideoImageProcessor/3000-13631_4-75985051.html?tag=ext-gen1149%3Bext-gen1150 Disclaimer: 1) I am the creator. 2) I don't earn anything, the app is free. 3) The app is not under development anymore so there might be errors...for which I apologize. <comment327100> After hunting around for quite a while for an app that could do this, this was exactly what I needed.  Open source software FTW.  :)
