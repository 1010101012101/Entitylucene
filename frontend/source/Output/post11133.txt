Send an application to a specific Space <body> Is there a way to send the current used application to a specific Space?  For example, I work in Space 1; I double-click on a document and an application starts to open this document. Is there a quick way to send this application to Space 2?  <answer11134> I don't think there's a particular kayboard shortcut you can use, but if you click on the app's title bar and hold mouse button and then click kbdctrl/kbd+kbdn/kbd where kbdn/kbd is the number of the screen you want to send it to it will be moved there. Bear in mind you will be moved there too.  <answer11164> If you want to always use the same Space for an application, then you can assign it from the "Espos√© and Spaces" preference panel.  "Every spaces" allows you to see the windows of that application in every spaces, independently  from the space where you opened that application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/19maD.png" alt="screenshot"  If you want to move an application window from a Space to another, then click on the Spaces icon shown in the dock, and Spaces will show you all the available spaces; from that screen you can move a window between spaces.  <comment11697> Super nice ! That's what I was looking for ! Thanks <comment30405> Looks like cmd + n works for me in Lion. <comment64809> One option would be to use SizeUp to assign shortcuts for moving the focused window to the next or previous space.
