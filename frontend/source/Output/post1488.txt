How to move a window to another space without using the mouse? <body> I use spaces for having multiple desktops, but often need to move a program from one space to another.  I am aware of the various ways to do that with a mouse:  ul liClick-and-hold on the title bar of window and drag to edge/li likbdF8/kbd to show all Spaces and drag to desired location/li liClick-and-hold on the title bar, and use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbd#/kbd or kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdScroll Arrow/kbd/li /ul  But have not been able to find a keyboard-only method. I use Linux for one of my primary workstations which has this ability and I would LOVE to use it with OSX as well.  <answer1492> While dragging a window, press key combo to move window to numbered space:  ul likbdControl/kbd + kbd1/kbd/li likbdControl/kbd + kbd2/kbd/li likbdControl/kbd + kbd3/kbd/li lietc .../li /ul  EDIT: For Lion, I had to go to System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Mission Control and enable these hotkeys.  <answer1496> h2SizeUp/h2  You could have a look at SizeUp, which has been recommended on apple.se at least once before - it has some nice keyboard tools for throwing windows around multiple monitors (as I use it) and also for throwing them around multiple 'spaces'.  It's not free, but it's very useful and certainly worth the small registration fee.  <answer163822> h2Amethyst/h2  With Amethyst, you can send windows to specific spaces using configurable keyboard shortcuts. One possible setup is:  ul likbdCommand/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbd1/kbd &nbsp;&nbsp;[send to Desktop 1]/li likbdCommand/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbd2/kbd &nbsp;&nbsp;[send to Desktop 2]/li likbdCommand/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbd3/kbd &nbsp;&nbsp;[send to Desktop 3]/li liand so on . . ./li /ul  By default, Amethyst automatically tiles your macOS windows. If you do not want automatic tiling or the extra layout features that Amethyst provides, then add "floating" to Layouts under Preferences and remove all other layouts. Also, disable any keyboard shortcuts you do not need under the "Shortcuts" tab.  <answer198549> strongBetterTouchTool/strong: free and does the job plus a lot of extra ;) I use it in combination with ShiftIt for window resizing.  <answer249787> Shiftit is awesome...   I use shiftit which is an open-source tool for resizing/moving windows.  To move a window you can click_hold_window + CTRL + space_number  <comment1358> This just moves the screen to another space, you actually have to click the window with the mouse and then use that shortcut to move the window. <comment1398> How right you are :) Answer updated. <comment1406> This is what I use and it’s great. <comment10098> possible duplicate of [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x) <comment19771> Hey nice, the question I have and its answer are all here in your question!  I just want to know how to move an app to another workspace, whether or not it uses the mouse. <comment39353> Ah, been using Sizup for some time (to mimic Aero snap), and didn't know this. Very useful. And indeed worth the registration fee. <comment45356> That "click & ctrl-#" trick is very usefull anyway. Thanks a lot. <comment46806> Not working on Lion! :( <comment137776> I tried SizeUp but it takes like a full second to move a window to another space. This is unacceptable :[ <comment152071> This method works fine for me with Mavericks and worked fine with Mountain Lion. The key is defining the shortcuts to jump to specific spaces (as @Nippysaurus said). <comment182249> Are you high? He said "without using the damn mouse", arghh <comment206664> There's also a free alternative, [Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/), although it doesn't have an option for multiple spaces. Works on well for multiple displays though. <comment213585> "Click window and use" - you have to press and hold the window, clicking is technically incorrect. <comment252928> Year later SizeUp still has one second delay when switching spaces. I suspect it's because OS X has no public API for this and they are doing some hackery to work around the limitation. <comment281035> a great tool, but no longer free.  Still well worth the few dollars, though. <comment281961> On the off chance anyone's looking at this thread years later, try Amethyst with BetterTouchTool (paid). Changed my life. The BetterTouchTool 'keyboard gestures' can be set up to do `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`L`/`H` to send a window one space to the right/left respectively; this complements  the normal shortcuts perfectly. Then set up trackpad or magic mouse gestures to perform the Amethyst shortcuts, like TipTaps for resizing the main window, or my favourite, 'two finger touch top' to left click and then set current window to main window (alt-shift-enter). Beautiful. <comment290486> Thanks for the tip @cormacrelf. FYI Gnome 3 does this all this stuff very elegantly out of the box. It's annoying that Apple makes us download multiple 3rd-party apps. <comment309953> Welcome to Ask Different! Please refrain from 1-sentence answers.

To your credit, this is easier for my fingers than what I'd been doing before: `ctrl + →` while dragging a window.
