Mac Mail Client sending and storing duplicates from Gmail <body> One of my team members approached me today asking about an issue they're having with their Mac Mail Client and Gmail. I am a Linux user and do not have much experience with Mac, but thought I would reach out to this community on their behalf.  ul liUser aggregating 3 email addresses into Mac Mail (Gmail Personal, Gmail Professional, Hotmail)/li liAll email providers set up properly as IMAP (POP on phone)/li liUser experiences duplicates in both Sent folder/li liUser's Drafts folders has incomplete information (some emails are missing)/li liMail Server information appears to be correct/li /ul  strongThoughts/strong  I am thinking that this might be an issue with IMAP vs. POP, but I figure that the Sent folder would be suffering from similar issues. What  <comment257464> How are the mails compared to the online gmail client? Does that look correct compared to Apple Mail? <comment257586> The emails are exact duplicates - no changes in text or HTML form.   What is your reason for asking? Do you think it might be a forwarding issue? <comment257592> I meant the mailboxes and how the mails add up there compared to the Apple Mail. Are there duplicates in the web interface as well? Same mails missing? <comment258218> @Hoshts Thank you for the clarification - The duplicates are only showing up in Apple Mail. <comment258220> Ok. So the online gmail accounts look correct then. That is good and sounds more like there is a problem with Apple Mail and not syncing. Have you tried to rebuild the mail database in the application?
