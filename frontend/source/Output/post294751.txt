Blue screen booting Lubuntu 16.04 from USB on Power Mac G4 <body> strongBackground/strong: I recently became determined to put Lubuntu on an old Mac of my dad's. I followed the instructions in this post to create a Lubuntu 16.04 bootable USB using this disk image.   strongProcedure/strong:  ul liComputer was started, holding down kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdO/kbd+kbdF/kbd/li liLocated the USB by entering codedev / ls/code at the prompt/li liEntered codeboot /pci@f2000000/usb@19/disk@1:,\\yaboot/code, taking cues from the previously cited post/li liPressed enter at code"Welcome to Lubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus)!"/code screen/li /ul  strongDescription of Error/strong:  The computer appears to load the kernel, and then attempts to load the ramdisk (appearing to succeed, no confirmation message visible). The screen flashes white with some (black) text, then to two different black screens with (white) text, then to a blue screen. Earlier, the blue screen persisted for a few minutes before returning to a black console, displaying a few screens, reducing to a blinking cursor which does not respond to key entry, and then ultimately leaving a black screen, which remains stagnant. Curiously, an error window appeared for a second when the power button on the computer was short-pressed. Upon attempting to re-produce the error, now all I am getting is a blue screen, but I will update the post if anything changes.  strongComputer and specs/strong:  The computer is a Dual-Mirror Drive Power Macintosh G4, running OS 10.4, with a 1.25 GHz processor, 1.5 Gb DDR RAM, and around 60 Gb of free hard drive memory.   I would be happy to provide any more pictures or information if any is needed.
