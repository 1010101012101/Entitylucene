MBA mid-2012, Yosemite, iTunes 12 and determining gapless playback <body> I'm having the same problem as the one described here: iTunes &quot;determining gapless playback information&quot; over and over at launch with iTunes 12 and Yosemite. I have 494 songs which iTunes determines gapless playback every time iTunes is opened.  Following the suggestion on this answer only reloads the codeLibrary.itl/code file from iCloud and does not sequence my personally loaded files. Therefore, the codeLibrary.itl/code file is significantly smaller (by a factor of 10) than the original .itl.   Any suggestions on how to resolve?  <comment230717> I'm not sure how it's managing to find & resync some file from iCloud - it's a local file only, as far as I knew. You sure you're breaking the correct file? ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Library.itl ? <comment230719> my library resides on an 'external' drive (mounted SD card) and the Library.itl is only on that drive <comment230720> My actual music is external too [on one machine it's a separate partition, on another it's the same Lib, networked. Both work the same way] - but the xml & itl are best left in the default location, that's where iTunes will look for it first, no matter where the Lib itself is, unless you've sym-linked it in some way. <comment230725> OK, so how do you suggest that I move them back?  When I follow your procedure, the .itl file is created on the external drive, which is where the .xml file lives also.  Looking through the preference settings, I do not see any options except for the location of the Media folder.  It's been several years since I created this configuration, so I don't remember exactly how I got iTunes to default to the external drive for the .itl and .xml files. <comment230729> Sorry, I don't know how you did it either, I've never tried. Did you check the default location, see what's in there? <comment230732> Yes, ~/Music/iTunes/ does not exist.  I guess I could create it and move the .itl and .xml files back there (leaving the actual media folder in place on the external drive. <comment230734> Tried creating ~/Music/iTunes/ and placing a broken .itl file in the folder.  Then deleted the .itl file from the external folder.  When I reopened iTunes, it recreated the .itl file in the external folder and did not do anything with the empty .itl file in the default location.  iTunes also did a DGP (determining gapless playback) pass on the 494 songs that are problematic.  ??? <comment230740> As I can't figure out how you got the itl etc on the external in the first place, I'd say see if someone else can shed light on that part. <comment230742> @Tetsujin -- Thanks for your assistance.  Will check with others.  Sorry for taking up so much of your time. <comment230743> No worries - hope you manage to figure it out :)
