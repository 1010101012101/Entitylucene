Macbook Pro 13" late 2011 external gpu <body> I have a late 2011 13 inch macbook pro with thunderbolt 1 ( i suppose, it was the first mbp with thunderbolt) and I'd like to connect an external gpu to it. I read about the bizon-box, however, the compability page says      MacBook Pro Lateâ€“2011 (Radeon 6750m or 6770m configurations only):   OS X: Unstable.   Windows: Detected issues (error 12/35).   https://support.bizon-tech.com/hc/en-us/articles/210709789  Is there anyone who managed to got it set up and working on this model of mbp?
