I was using it on a clean install of El Capitan, but after Sierra, the app crash right after toolbars appear.

Maybe it is a lost cause... for now moving to another app.  <answer256694> Was this a clean install of Adobe or an "restore" from a Time Machine backup?  I have personally had issues when going from one issue to the next (Mavericks to Yosemite and Yosemite to El Capitan) and migrating my software instead of clean installing it.  Doing a clean install fixed my issue each time.  So, first thing to do, is uninstall and do a clean installation of Illustrator.  At the time of this writing, Adobe wasn't experiencing any issues with Illustrator.  See macOS Sierra (10.12) compatibility FAQ | Creative Cloud  However, they do provide a link for people to report bugs.  If doing a clean install doesn't solve the problem I would report the problem.  <answer257926> I had the same, identical error that you were receiving  Reinstall worked for me - First, I had to update to Java 8, so that I could use the updated Adobe App Manager. To find the Adobe App Manager, search Google for "other adobe downloads" then go to   other adobe downloads  From there, I selected Macintosh, once you download and install the updated Adobe App Manager, then launch and follow the steps to re-install. It seemed to disappear after confirming my Serial Number, then I re-launched the Adobe Illustrator installer, re-entered my Serial Number and it installed.  Once it finished, I launched Adobe Illustrator CS6 with no problem  <answer276996> Try deleting the Adobe .plists in Library/Preferences  <comment320087> I read that earlier versions of the Adobe suite do not work well (or at all) with Sierra. Check out [this link](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom/kb/lightroom-and-mac-os-sierra.html) and see if your version is listed as having compatibility issues. <comment320090> @Frysk thanks for the link. Issues on Sierra for now only Lightroom and Photoshop, according with [this link](https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/global/macos-sierra-compatibility.html). I'm keeping looking for a clue in adobe support forum. <comment320218> It was clean install. Steps done, remove adobe folders (~/library, /library, /applications, /applications/utilities) and cleaner tool, this was made for CC 2014 and CC 2015 trial. <comment320220> One more thing...for my install of Illustrator under El Cap, I had to download the correct version of Java.  Make sure Java is updated correctly <comment320234> Thanks for the tip, but I'm not using Java at all, and under El capitan everything was fine. I only saw things about install Java on installation of CS6. <comment322379> Thanks @KRONUS, CS6 seems work with no problem, after installing the proper Java version. That's not exactly my case, I'm trying to run a CC version (any, 2014, 2015, lastest), but none of them is working, not even installing with proper 'hack'. For while moving to Affinity Designer, cheaper and care about who use their software. <comment348691> Welcome to Ask Different!
