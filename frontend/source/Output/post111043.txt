Is it possible to upgrade mountain lion to mavericks from .raw file <body> I have a OS X mavericks in .raw extension. Is it possible to upgrade my mountain lion from it , if possible how  I downloaded it from torrent which is zipped file which contains .raw file. I guess the extension is meant for USB stick.  <answer111046> No.  Download the DMG from the App Store.  Any other way of obtaining Mavericks is probably illegal.  <comment130702> What kind of format is this, where did you get it from? <comment130704> Let's put this on old until we can clarify if this is about installing pirated software or if it's about file formats used under the hood by Apple.
