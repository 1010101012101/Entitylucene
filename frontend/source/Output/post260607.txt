Adding RAM to a MacPro 5.1 <body> I just tried to add 2 x 16 gb RAM to my Mac Pro 5.1 (12 core 3.33 ghz). The machine wouldn't start up (flashing power light) until I took out all my other RAM (4 x 4 gb) and used ONLY the 2 x 16 sticks in slots 1 and 2.  Any idea if the other ram SHOULD still work? I can't find any other ram configuration that will still boot...  <comment326319> What are the specs of all the RAM?  Are they all the same specs other than capacity?
