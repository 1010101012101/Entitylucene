Using pinyin with tones to input Chinese characters <body> I'm a Chinese learner and know from my teacher that there is software (for Windows), which lets you strictly input withtype in pinyin with tones. E.g.  codehao3/code becomes code好/code. The Mac OS shipped Chinese input does have pinyin input, but no tone selection, hence you input codehao/code to get code好/code (no tone mark). I wonder if there is any way for me to use a pinyin input with tones for Mac OS or on my ipad.  <answer244970> I think QIM may do this, but I have not verified it myself:  http://www.laoshilink.org/laoshilink/QIM.html  <answer245138> Making the user input a tone used to be the default in OS X, but not since at least OS X 10.8. Now it continues to guess your characters as you keep typing, and since it's pretty good at guessing, I guess tone selection was deemed an unnecessary step.  There may be some way you can fiddle with codecom.apple.inputmethod.SCIM.plist/code or codecom.apple.inputmethod.TCIM.plist/code to bring the old behavior back, but at least in the preferences menu that option is no longer available.  One thing you can do: after typing the "untoned" pinyin for a character, cycle through the four tones by hitting kbdTab/kbd (it's kbdOption/kbd + kbdTab/kbd in Traditional Chinese). This will limit the list of suggestions to one particular tone at a time (it also displays a diacritical mark over your pinyin as a visual indicator of which tone you're on).  <comment301943> On the website it says that one should input the pinyin without tone marks... <comment301954> @LongHoang But I think there may be an option for using tones in the settings. You would have to install it to see for sure what it can do. <comment301955> @LongHoang         Also you can search/ask in a group devoted to Chinese here: http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chinesemac <comment302076> Argh.. seem to not work for El Capitan :( <comment302162> I don't need to use option when doing the tabbing.  In fact you have found a good solution.  Just type pinyin plus the number of tabs corresponding to the tone and you have them.  The pinyin even shows the tone diacritic while you are doing it. <comment302163> Ah, Option is only necessary for Traditional Chinese. I'll edit. Thanks!
