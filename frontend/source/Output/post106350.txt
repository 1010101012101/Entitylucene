How do I save a screenshot with the ISO 8601 date format with Applescript? <body> I am building a script that saves many consecutive screenshots. I would like to save the files in the ISO 8601 date format.  <answer106378> To get the date in ISO 8601 format, use:  precodeon date_to_iso(dt)     set {year:y, month:m, day:d} to dt     set y to text 2 through -1 of ((y + 10000) as text)     set m to text 2 through -1 of ((m + 100) as text)     set d to text 2 through -1 of ((d + 100) as text)     return y &amp; "-" &amp; m &amp; "-" &amp; d end date_to_iso  on date_time_to_iso(dt)     set {year:y, month:m, day:d, hours:h, minutes:min, seconds:s} to dt     set y to text 2 through -1 of ((y + 10000) as text)     set m to text 2 through -1 of ((m + 100) as text)     set d to text 2 through -1 of ((d + 100) as text)     set h to text 2 through -1 of ((h + 100) as text)     set min to text 2 through -1 of ((min + 100) as text)     set s to text 2 through -1 of ((s + 100) as text)     return y &amp; "-" &amp; m &amp; "-" &amp; d &amp; "T" &amp; h &amp; ":" &amp; min &amp; ":" &amp; s end date_time_to_iso /code/pre  You can call these with, for example:  precodeset dt to current date date_to_iso(dt) /code/pre  gives something like "2013-10-23"  precodeset dt to current date date_time_to_iso(dt) /code/pre  gives something like "2013-10-23T14:00:05"  Source: AppleScript Date to ISO Format  <answer106379> There isn't any single ISO 8601 date format: for example 20130823, 2013W43, and 2013-123 are valid ISO 8601 dates.  If you mean the format like 2013-10-23T21:03:34, colons are not valid characters in filenames in Finder or other GUI applications. Colons in the shell are displayed as slashes in Finder and vice versa.  This would use a format like 20131023210334:  precodedo shell script "screencapture ~/Desktop/$(date +%Y%y%m%d%H%M%S).png" /code/pre  codedate -u +%FT%TZ/code (where -u sets the time zone to UTC) would use a format like 2013-10-23T18:03:34Z, but the colons would be displayed as slashes in GUI applications.
