Is there such an application?  <answer50795> Have you seen Capo? I have the iPad version, and it does what you want. I assume the desktop version does the same.  <answer56928> djay is what I was looking for. I really like it, as it integrates with your iTunes library, and auto-updates when you add new songs to your library. It has a visual waveform, as well as a vinyl representation of the song, which allows you to move a needle around on the record, skipping from place to place in the song.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7reV.png" alt=""  It emis/em $19.99 on the Mac app store, but it is packed with great features!  <comment58210> I'll check it out. Thanks for your answer, Nix! <comment60941> I do like Capo, but it doesn't integrate with iTunes :-( See my new answer on this question. <comment95173> And I'll add that there's an awesome iPhone/iPad version that rocks!!
