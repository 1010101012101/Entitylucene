MacBook Air doesn't power on with the power-on button <body> MacBook Air doesn't power on with the power-on button. But when I remove battery connection and put back it works. As long as it is in sleep mode it works. But when I switch OFF it doesn't power on and needs the battery connection to be reconnected.  <answer263845> h2Have you tried resetting the strongSMC/strong (System Management Controller)?/h2  With charger plugged in, hold kbdShift/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd on the left side of the keyboard, then press the kbdPower/kbd.

It takes more than just a poke, like a normal keyboard key. Forgive me if you know this already. <comment330599> Maybe the button is broken. <comment330935> Yes I tried resetting the SMC. Did not work. <comment330964> How do I know that the button is broken? externally it appears fine... <comment331086> What are the specs of your MBA & Which model year? Many of the late '13 MBA had problems with the logic board. <comment331257> It is 13 inch Macbook Air mid-2013, 1.7 GHz Intel Core i7 has 8 GB1600 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 5000 1536 MB and 512 GB Hard disk.  OS X El Capitan. Thanks <comment331468> When you reset the SMC, did the Magsafe LED change colors? If not, then the power button is physically broken to have not responded for the SMC reset. If color did change & still unresponsive to power on, its more than likely Logic Board. <comment332710> Thanks for the replies.....The Magsafe LED color is orange when the laptop is partially charged and becomes green when it is fully charged (like normal). When I reset the SMC during that time it does not flicker nor does it change color change colors. If it is orange it remains orange and if it is green it remains green...Since past 5 days I have taken care not to use the power button to "Switch off" the Macbook.... I have kept it in the standby mode (by just closing the lid) ....Macbook works fine this way...Worried that if I "switch off" the Macbook with power button it wouldn't start again.
