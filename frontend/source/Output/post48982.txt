Creating iTunes ID using existing Apple ID <body> I've an Apple ID already, which I got after registering at codedeveloper.apple.com/code. Now when I sign-in using iTunes, it says the id has not been used with iTunes and needed to review. When I click on review button, it asks some information and my credit card details. Since I am not purchasing anything, I put a card info which I rarely use. On Clicking submit, it doesn't accept the card info.br Why apple need Card info just to sign-in to iTunes, and will it deduct any money for signing in??  <answer48987> When you registered at codedeveloper.apple.com/code, had you Provided credit card information?
