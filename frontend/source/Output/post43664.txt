What is the latest version of Safari that runs on PowerPC (PPC)? <body> I wonder if Apple still delivers new version of safari for PowerPC-based macs. On that computer, I'm stuck with firefox 3.6.28. Is Safari still updated on PPC system updates?   <answer43669> This depends on the OS you're running.  ul liLeopard: Safari 5.0.6/li liTiger: Safari 4.1.3/li /ul  Newer Macs can use...  ul liSnow Leopard/Lion: Safari 5.1.4/li /ul  <answer43692> Safari for leopard has been discontinued. If you are looking for a browser that is currently receiving updates TenFourFox is a fork of firefox that is updated along side the primary version, but remains compatible with PowerPC cpu's.  <answer111805> While Safari 5.0.6 is the last version for 10.5, newer versions of the webkit framework can be obtained from the leopard-webkit project https://code.google.com/p/leopard-webkit/ . Webkit based applications can use the newer framework to provide updated rendering.   <comment49633> Can I be confident about the fact that Software-Updates will install the lastest possible version on that computer and stops before the first incompatible one? (Not as Firefox that keeps asking me to update to v11!) <comment49656> @Rabskatran I'm 99% convinced that Apple's Software update will not install incompatible Software by Apple. Therefore, you should not be prompted. Apple's software update has not prompted you to update to Safari 5 on your current os, has it?
