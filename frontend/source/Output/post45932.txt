How can I prevent certain tracks from going to iPod? <body> I manually put music onto my iPod by dragging albums over from the library in iTunes.  For some albums, I don't want all of the tracks to copy over to the iPod - for example, audio commentaries and dialog tracks.  Short of deleting these tracks from my iTunes library, how can I prevent specific tracks from being copied over to the iPod when I place albums?  <answer45934> I love the setting where you can only sync songs with the checkbox to one or more iOS devices.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAXw1.png" alt="iTunes - Sync only checked songs and video"  Simple deselect the songs by plalist, genre, or as you find them and even if they are in a playlist or genius mix that would normally install the song on your device during a sync, iTunes will suppress those songs that are not check marked.  <answer45940> bmike's answer is correct; alternatively, you could select the album and hold kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd while clicking the tracks you don't wish to copy. Then, drag the still-selected ones to the iPod.  <comment52368> What did you use to draw that awesome arrow? <comment52372> Nice bonus answer! I always forget about manually adding and this is a nice combination of selection tools and drag/drop. <comment52374> Skitch - it's on the App Store - free <comment52380> Ah, that's what it is. <comment52405> Hmmm - this option is greyed out for me.  Perhaps because I don't don't have "Sync Music" selected?  (I just drag over stuff that I want.) <comment52406> That's a great observation. I've honestly never tried that. You can have both sync music ( but select no playlists to sync ) and still retain your preferred method. Feel free to edit my answer to cover this case if you find it may help others. <comment52703> I apologize if I'm being dense, but how can I have both 'sync music' and 'dragging stuff over' working? <comment52735> First you turn on sync, then you drag songs and playlists to the device with the mouse. <comment53238> This works great - thanks!
