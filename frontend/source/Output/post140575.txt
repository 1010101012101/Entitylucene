I have a mid-2012 MacBook Air, and the Service Battery alert is showing <body> My 13" Macbook Air recently started showing the "service battery" alert. It's the mid-2012 model, and is still under Apple Care. The alert seems to appear mainly when I'm running off the battery. Is this a battery issue or a bug in the system?  <answer140583> If it is still under Applecare I would absolutely get it checked out.  In the very least if there is an issue, you will get the battery replaced under warranty and be able to enjoy a few more years with it.  <answer140615> This the battery failing, get it checked out and replaced for free.   <answer140697> You don't say what version of OS X you're running, but if it's 10.9, note that other users have reported a change in battery alerts after upgrading to that version.  http://www.zdnet.com/macbook-users-seeing-service-battery-message-after-mavericks-upgrade-7000022588/  Open Utilities  System Information, click on "Power" in the left column and see what stats show up for your battery. This will be useful when talking to Applecare.  <comment165816> I'm running Mavericks <comment166186> So check that first link I posted.
