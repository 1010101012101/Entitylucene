How do I make my MacBook Pro (mid 2009) running Lion, DNLA compatible? <body> I would like to view photos and videos on my smart TV.  I do not do video games and am not real technically knowledgeable so need answer in layman's terms.  <answer86580> One way would be to install p3mediaserver which is free and does provide DNLA functionality. Despite its name it not only works with a PS3 on the other end.  To install just download the .dmg linked above, double-click to open and drag the application to your /Applications folder. All folders are shared by default, but this can (and should) be restricted in the settings.  hr  OTOH you might be better off with investing in an Apple TV box which makes the whole sharing thing much easier.  <comment100068> Have you done anything beyond posting a question here in terms of researching a solution to your issue? (i.e. Google searches, etc..) <comment100069> In response to Mort, yes, I did several google searches and found several suggestions mentioning many different softwares all using technotalk that I couldn't really understand.  Thanks to patrix for your suggestion.  I will try p3mediaserver. <comment100096> @Bushwhacker Could you please add the software/links you already found to the question? It might help to understand what you consider to be technotalk.
