Safari - how to see web developer tools like DOM inspector? <body> In on Yosemite using Safari.  How can I "inspect element"  I've looked through all the preferences and don't see any way to turn on developer tools so I can do inspect element (if that is even possible with them).  <answer195192> Found it - a bit hidden its at the bottom of preferences - advanced, i.e.  "Show Develop menu in menu bar"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voZQH.png" alt="enter image description here"
