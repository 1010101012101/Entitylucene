Can I get my text messages back from my lost iPhone? <body> I lost my iPhone so I bought a new one. I am now wanting to get my text messages back.  Can I get my text messages back? If I get my old mobile number back will my text messages come back? Does iCloud store text messages?  <answer137429> If you used iCloud backup, you can restore your previous phone's backup to your new phone by resetting the new phone's Content and Settings in Settings â†’ Reset.  iMessages are separate to SMS/MMS and will be restored when you log in with your Apple ID into iCloud. Both of these are separate from your mobile number. iCloud does not store SMS/MSS messages like iMessages, only the database in iCloud backup.  hr  This iLounge guide has more information about restoring text messages from an iCloud backup.  <comment163309> Do you have a backup on iCloud or iTunes? <comment163336> This post does not cite any references or sources.
