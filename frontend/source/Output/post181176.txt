Terminal Sudo "3 incorrect password attemps" <body> Every time I do something in emTerminal/em where you need a password following thing comes:     Sorry, try again.      Sorry, try again.      Sorry, try again.      sudo: 3 incorrect password attempts   What am I doing wrong?  <comment215417> So what is your question? Obviously you don't use the right password, and obviously we do not know what it is. The sudo password in OSX is the same as that of your user account. Have you tried that? <comment215419> Well I went to System Preferences  Users & Groups  Login Option  Network Account Server and enabled root and set my password... still doesn't work! <comment215421> So, just to check, if you are in terminal and you type "sudo echo abc" and you enter your user password, it does not work? <comment215422> Well it doesn't even ask after my password... :( <comment215424> Could you disable root, log out,  and try again? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012 <comment215426> Nop doesn't work <comment215428> So after you disabled root, logged out, logged in again, you entered "sudo echo abc" in terminal, right? Did it ask for a password now? <comment215437> With you last comment about enabling the root account now I know the misunderstanding! When you use sudo, you do not need to enable the root account and you do not need to know root's password. sudo = "Super User DO", that means you need to enter YOUR password for sudo to execute a command AS super user. Of course you need the admin privilege on your account, e.g. it MUST be an administrators account you are calling sudo in the terminal app. For instance, to open a root shell `sudo su -`would be enough. Try it, it should work.
