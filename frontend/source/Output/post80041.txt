Using gwhois on OSX <body> How does one install gwhois on a Mac? I'm already up and running with Homebrew; I assume that there's some magic perl configuration required before it will run.  I've tried the following:  precodebrew install libidn sudo cpan Net::LibIDN sudo cpan LWP::Simple sudo cp pattern /etc/gwhois/ sudo cp gwhois /usr/bin/ sudo cp gwhois.1 /usr/share/man/man1/ /code/pre  And when I run gwhois I get  precodeCan't locate Net/LibIDN.pm in @INC (@INC contains: /Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Library/Perl/5.12 /Network/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /Network/Library/Perl/5.12 /Library/Perl/Updates/5.12.4 /System/Library/Perl/5.12/darwin-thread-multi-2level /System/Library/Perl/5.12 ...) at /usr/bin/gwhois line 81.

You need lynx (maybe you get it using brew, otherwise load it down and build it using Xcode and the CLI tools). Curl and Perl is already there. To install LWP::Simple run   precodesudo cpan LWP::Simple /code/pre  in terminal. And to copy of the files in point 1 - 3 works with this  precodesudo cp pattern /etc/gwhois/ sudo cp gwhois /usr/bin/ sudo cp gwhois.1 /usr/share/man/man1/ /code/pre  I haven´t tried it but it should work. Then you can run gwhois in terminal.  <answer80201> See decription above. We need Xcode (I use 4.5.1 including the CLI tools which you can download in the preferences tab of Xcode) and Lion (I use 10.7.5 but should work also fine in 10.8).  Lynx :   precodecd $HOME mkdir Source cd Source curl -L ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/infosys/browsers/lynx//lynx2.8.7/lynx2.8.7.tar.gz -o lynx2.8.7.tar.gz tar -xzvf lynx2.8.7.tar.gz cd lynx2-8-7 ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install /code/pre  LibIDN :   precodecd .. curl -L http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libidn/libidn-1.26.tar.gz -o libidn-1.26.tar.gz tar -xzvf libidn-1.26.tar.gz cd libidn-1.26 export CFLAGS="-arch x86_64 -arch i386" ./configure CC="clang" &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install /code/pre  Check the LibIDN build :  precodecd /usr/local/lib lipo -info libidn.11.dylib /code/pre  That should tell : Architectures in the fat file: libidn.11.dylib are: x86_64 i386  Perl modules :   precodesudo cpan LWP::Simple sudo cpan Net::LibIDN /code/pre  If cpan reports some errors, re-run the command, it needs a stable connection.  Gwhois :   precodecd $HOME/Source curl -L http://gwhois.de/gwhois/gwhois_20120626.tar.gz -o gwhois_20120626.tar.gz tar -xzvf gwhois_20120626.tar.gz cd gwhois-20120626 sudo mkdir /etc/gwhois/ sudo cp ./pattern /etc/gwhois/ sudo cp ./gwhois /usr/bin/ sudo cp ./gwhois.1 /usr/share/man/man1/ /code/pre  Have fun and run in terminal for example :  precodegwhois orf.at /code/pre  ... or, whatever you like.  <comment92470> Thanks; still didn't work though. I think that the LWP::Simple module can't be found in @INC; I've updated my original question to show the error message. <comment92517> So, you need a libidn.dylib which was build for 32 and also 64 bit and I don´t know how to fix this with brew (builds by default a 64 bit lib). As I told, I don´t use MacPorts, Fink or Homebrew ... so I post a new answer the long way to build all from source. <comment92560> Ugh; brew was only installing the x86_64 symbols for libidn; perl wanted i386 as well. So I uninstalled libidn with brew, built it from source, installed Net::LibIDN, and everything started working. THANK YOU! <comment92571> ;-) brew does nothing else then to look which dependencies are need and build all what is needed. But at the end, the configure script uses the settings of your machine thats why only x86_64 builds are there. Don´t know which Lynx you use but mine don´t supports SSL (thats a little problem). Run `./configure --help=short` (in the directory of the Lynx source) to see all build options. You can check that in terminal using `lynx https://asslsite`. <comment92703> Thanks; some day I may write a brew formula that sorts all this out. For now, I'm just glad I've got it working :)
