Updated application keeps asking to be updated <body> It's been a long time since Boom app released an update: March 26, according to App Store. I was successful to update, as Boom states that I am in version 1.9.4, the March 26 release. But, despite that, every time that I check for new updates, App Store says that I have a new update. And, again, it asks me to update Boom app.  The same situation is happening with SofaPlay Lite, as you can see in this picture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXPY3.png" alt="App Store doesn&#39;t acknowledges that Boom and SofaPlay Lite are already updated"  Any ideas on how to solve this?  <comment230061> I've known running the latest combo updater to have fixed that issue [I've also known it not work, but it's worth a try] https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1804?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US <comment230090> Hmm, nice try. The problem is that I am not in Yosemite yet. I'm still on Mountain Lion, as far as I remember (I am not on my Mac now), because I want to backup before updating, and I didn't have time to do that yet. <comment230101> there's a combo updater for every OS version except x.x.1  If you don't include information, we can only guess. <comment230248> I'm sorry. Actually, my version is 10.9.5 (Mavericks). As you suggested, I tried installing this: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US , but it says my system doesn't meet the requirements. There is more than 100GB available in my disk, so I don't really know what the problem is. <comment230283> I've no idea why it would say it doesn't meet the requirements if that's what you're already running
