Does Secure Keyboard Entry Prevent All Forms of Keyloggers? <body> I had an understanding that Secure Keyboard Entry (or EnableSecureEventInput) was a feature that essentially disabled keyloggers.  Is that the case? Are there ways around it?  <answer95438> Almost correct but:  Using the Secure keyboard Entry (on screen key board) will not keep some supper hacker from using the screen capture to see what you entering.  That is assuming you have a serious bug on your system.
