How can I scroll to the top/bottom of web page with a three finger gesture? <body> I'd like to use a three finger swipe to scroll to the top or bottom of a web page. Is there a way to make that work?  <answer40559> h1BetterTouchTool (free)/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T77Tt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment49450> It works pretty well, but the window needs to have focus. And it doesn't work with all windows - I guess it depends on how the receiving applications interprets the event.
