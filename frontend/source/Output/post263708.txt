With hardlinks, does it matter which is which? <body> If I make replace duplicate files with hardlinks within my home (~) directory, I'm thinking it is completely irrelevant which of two files gets replaced.  Is this true, or is there some asymmetry that I am not aware of?  <answer263709> No - hard links work like individual files. As long as you make the next link/copy in the correct folder/directory - you are good to go. When you cross a filesystem boundary - the link breaks automagically and it becomes a distinct file.  <comment330418> I'm not making another; I'm replacing one of two identical files.  I believe that it doesn't matter which file gets deleted and linked.  Just trying to make sure. <comment330423> Yep @WGroleau  it doesn't matter. The link will exist in both places and there's no difference which is first. Good question - +1
