How do I simulate the Insert key in Windows on a MacBook Pro? <body>    strongNote:/strong This question is how to send an kbdInsert/kbd keypress to strongMicrosoft Windows/strong running emdirectly/em on Apple hardware. This is strongnot/strong about how to use kbdInsert/kbd in OS X or strongthrough OS X to Windows running in a VM./strong See here or here for non-Windows Q&amp;A's.   Somehow in my code editor and command line I keep toggling the Insert key, but I'm not sure how.  I can toggle it by clicking on OVR/INS in the status bar, but what is the key combo that I'm magically fat fingering?  <answer84390> Apparently kbdfn/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd is the winner.  <answer87596> I have been able to find no way to do so, with a modern Macbook Pro. (The keyboard view only shows a minimal keyboard)  hr     Apparently kbdfn/kbd + kbdreturn/kbd is the winner.   Not on newer Macs, that key combination is just 'enter' (instead of 'return').  <answer137070> The keycombination kbdfn/kbd + kbdi/kbd is resulting in the same  as stronginsert/strong does on Windows.   <answer139748> the answer is Fn + m  however, to make it work:  ol liRun the On-Screen Keyboard (Windows 2012: Windows Key + C to bring up the charms, click Search, type "keyboard")/li liClick on Options/li liTurn on numeric key pad/li liMake sure NumLock is turned off (so you can see the Ins key where the 0 would be)/li lion the regular keyboard the "m" is where the 0 is, therefore Fn + m = Insert/li /ol  <answer168082> fn + Enter - it's working on Windows 7 installed at MacBook Pro  <answer169370> I just wanted to point out, that you can map any key or key combination in OSX to any other key or key combination using Karabiner.  In my case, I'm using the following configuration to send codeInsert/code to Windows through TeamViewer, for example when running NVDA screen reader software (which heavily relies on key combinations using codeInsert/code) to test websites for accessibility.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Fn + Ctrl-Left to Insert&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.fn_ctrl_to_insert&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;       __KeyToKey__KeyCode::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::FN,       KeyCode::PC_INSERT     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  This way, for example, I can send codeInsert+N/code (which opens the NVDA menu) by pressing codeFn+Ctrl+N/code in OSX.  <answer178981> strongfn+Enter/strong works for me in Windows 8.1 in the BootCamp of a MacBook Pro  Other interesting key combinations:  ul listrongfn+Delete/strong: Delete next character (as opposed to Delete which deletes the previous character)/li listrongfn+Shift+F11/strong: Print screen to clipboard/li listrongrightAlt+3/strong: # symbol/li /ul  I found many of them in https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5636  <answer190705> While running Midnight commander in terminal on MBP (OSX Yosemite) I use codectrl-T/code for simuating INS  <answer193320> option + command + i is the winner  <answer217120> Given the diversity of options that sometimes work or not, I thought to try the Onscreen Keyboard that Windows has in it's "Ease of Access" menu.  The OSK has an Insert key and it works fine after you select the relevant foreground window.  Once done, close OSK and carry on as normal in your VM  <answer220060> I'm using Apple Wirelss Keyboard model A1314 on an DELL XPS 13 laptop running Ubuntu 14.04 and for me, Fn+Shift+return key combination offers what shift+insert offers in Windows, which is paste.   <comment102424> Is that in Windows or OS X?  My question was regarding Win <comment163060> This does not work in Windows; are you in OS X? <comment164708> by the same token, Fn + . = Del <comment164709> Are you kidding? Why would anyone go through that process instead of just fn + return for Insert, or fn + "delete" for Delete <comment164899> because that solution doesn't work for everyone (like me) <comment164904> I couldn't get your solution to work; what hardware and OS (8/Server 2012?) are you using? <comment165247> @NickT, I have a MBP (2.8GHz) running OSX 10.9.4 and I'm RDPing into Windows Server 2012 via the 8.0.7 client <comment165248> @NickT, as per the other thread, Fn + Return evaluates to just Return on my hardware <comment165252> not on my hardware (I have an early 2013 MacBook Pro) running Mavericks.  for me, Fn + Return just generates a return <comment171355> @ekkis if you're running Mavericks (or any other OS X version), this question does not apply. "How do I simulate the Insert key **in Windows** on a MacBook Pro?" <comment171532> why not? I'm running Windows on a MBP running Mavericks <comment171541> @ekkis are you in a VM or running bare metal? <comment171733> I'm running VMWare <comment177522> I'm in OS X, this worked for me. Thanks :) <comment192681> This doesn't work on a 2014 macbook pro running Yosemite. This just doe a "return". <comment196065> I have the same issue with MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014). FN+Return does not work. <comment196066> @fidelp to clarify; what OS are you running? <comment219470> Just not true. Does not work on a Macbook Pro Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013 Yosemite 10.10.3. Sends a "return." Tried Fn + Return, Fn + i, Fn + Ctrl + m, Fn + Ctrl + i. Fails in a Windows 7 client in a VM. Fails in a Windows game ported to Mac asking for Insert (Freespace 2 Open). Fails on a different MBP at home. <comment219473> I think this has been changed in recent hardware. I am downvoting wrong answers and upvoting yours. If someone wants to make an answer that has a list of which Macs, running which version of the OS, and in what application (VM, Bootcamp) which key combination = Insert, well, that will get an upvote. This is an open question all over Google because of many varying Mac configurations. I've tried on 4 different Macs and gotten varying success. It doesn't help that there are easy key rebinding apps that have concealed the complexity of the issue. <comment219474> Not every time, not my hardware, and so the answer needs to be edited to reflect on which Macs this works. See my comments in the other answers. <comment219477> The OP specifies a MBP, the link to support.apple you cite states Fn + ENTER only works using an "Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad" and specifically shows NO entry for "Insert" under "Apple USB & Wireless keyboard" or "MacBook Pro keyboard" which is what the OP is using. <comment219538> @geoO see the question; running a VM is very explicitly out of scope. <comment219550> Someone please help me and edit the question to make it clear that I'm asking about bare-metal (not VM, not remote desktop, not OS X in any way...) Windows on a MBP. I clearly don't know how to. <comment219876> I was stating no go in a VM, etc *in addition to* the original question. I addressed a wider scope than necessary maybe I wasn't clear. If Fn + Return works in Bootcamp for some, it isn't working on *my* Bootcamp install. Bootcamp drivers? hardware differences? Don't know. I have to vote in accordance with my ability to replicate the answer. And I simply couldn't get Fn + Return to work as Insert in any circumstance. If this works for others then their upvotes will outnumber the downvotes, and SE works as intended. <comment219878> Which MBP specifically? I'm trying to compile a list of Mac hardware/OS where this works. Apple support (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202676) states that it does not work with a MBP keyboard, and I can't get Fn + Enter to work on my MBP. Did you use a Bluetooth or USB keyboard? Did you remap any keys using software? Which version of the Bootcamp drivers are you using? <comment219884> @geoo the only thing I can see in your first comment that's salient is "on a different MBP at home", which isn't that informative <comment247668> Excellent, thank you. I knew I could do it with Karabiner, but I wasn't overly keen to figure out their XML config. Thanks so very very much! <comment247669> THIS is the actual right answer! <comment256978> @Doc the answerer doesn't seem to be running Windows on their hardware, but remotely. Ask a separate question if you want this to be the "right answer" :P <comment256982> @NickT: Yup, I understand. I used this solution to help my mother who RDPs to a Windows box and needs an Insert key for her work. She uses it many many times per day, it works great. <comment257068> I also run virtual machines using VMWare Fusion, so in some way I'm running Windows on my hardware (except its virtualised). <comment346110> Works on VirtualBox Win7 / MBP Sierra combination
