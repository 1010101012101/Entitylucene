The iPhone is synced with another iTunes library error Message <body> Whenever I select to manually manage music and videos, I get an error message that says "codeThe iPhone is synced with another iTunes library. Do you want to erase this iPhone and sync with this iTunes library?/code"   strongI haven't connected my iPhone to any other computer,/strong the one I am using now is the original it was connected to (Windows PC), why is this message appearing? The only reason I can think of that it thinks it is a new iTunes library is that I updated to iTunes 11 recently. Is there anything I can do to fix this without erasing my iPhone?  <answer116282> If you are using the same PC from the beginning and if you want the same songs in your device why can't you clean the memory of your iPhone and dump it again.   Usually this happens when your iPhone is synced with other PC, but this may happen when your phone memory wants some formatting as well.   Some iPhones need to be formatted twice an year coz' they need a white wash.   <answer131748> The fact is you are switching to strongmanual/strong syncing, thus everything will be removed and synced back on your device. You don't have to worry if everything is in your iTunes library.  Or you could leave it to the automatic version of sync and you don't get a warning like this.  <comment175669> Syncing with the same PC, that has a new iTunes library, is the exactly why its telling you its synced with a different library...  The library file has changed.  If the content is the same, you should erase the phone and re-sync everything. <comment184489> I've been reviewing old questions & answers for a week now & this wins the award for being the worst piece of misinformation so far.
