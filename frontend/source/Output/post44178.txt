How can I tell iTunes to stop playing a song? <body> I do mean emstop/em, not empause/em. If one navigates to, say, the iTunes Store, the Pause button changes to Stop, but I want something that always works no matter my location in iTunes.  Workarounds (such as AppleScript) are acceptable as long as they aren't too difficult to set up.  <answer44180> In Applescript, the script codetell app "iTunes" to stop/code should work.   And the pause button is only available in the currently playing playlist; emanywhere/em else, it will be stop.  <answer44181> The AppleScript for this is pretty simple:  precodetell application "iTunes" to stop /code/pre  You can make this easily accessible by creating a Service.  Open Automator and create a new document. Select the Service document type. Set the Service receives: menu to codeno input/code. Drag in a codeRun AppleScript/code module and paste that code into its text box. Save the service and give it a name.  You'll now be able to activate it by going to the current app's menu and choosing Services- Stop iTunes (or whatever you named the service).  You can assign a keyboard shortcut by going to System Preferences- Keyboard- Services, finding the service (it should be under General at the bottom) and adding a shortcut.  <answer140085> You can't! What I do is either "Quit iTunes" or delete the tract (I only delete if I already have the song on a DVD; I can add it back to my library at a later date).  iTunes is not user friendly. I use it sparingly.  <answer204356> Hold the Option key down, while clicking the Pause button.  <comment165606> Your answer is utterly false. Since time of asking (at which point even then your answer was incorrect), iTunes now lets one stop playback with command-period or the respective menu item.
