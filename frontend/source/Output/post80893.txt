"Cannot execute binary file" with alias of binary <body> I have installed both python3.3 and python2.6.  I have set python3.3 to default by creating an alias named "python" in usr/bin and another one for python2.6 named "python2.6". Now if I type in the terminal "python" python3.3 will be open but if I type "python2.6" I get "cannot execute binary file".  I can launch the binary directly but not through the alias. I have checked the permissions and are the same for both binaries and aliases so I don't know what to do. Can someone help me?  <answer80899> Instead of using Finder aliases, use Terminal to create symbolic links (see codeman ls/code for details):  precodeln -s /path/to/python3.3/binary /usr/local/bin/python ln -s /path/to/python2.6/binary /usr/local/bin/python2.6 /code/pre  It's usually not a good idea to mess with code/usr/bin/code content (will be wiped out with the next upgrade). Use code/usr/local/bin/code instead and make sure it comes before code/usr/bin/code in $PATH.  <comment93292> Did you create aliases (in Finder) or symbolic links (in Terminal)? Can you execute the python2.6 binary in its installation directory directly? <comment93293> Aliases using finder and yes, I can run python 2.6 from the original folder without problems. <comment93294> I would recommend using symbolic links for this instead of aliases <comment93295> I created a link using "ln" and it's working. Thank you. <comment93296> Ok, thanks again.
