How do I import my OSX Keyboard Shortcuts? <body> After a clean OS install, is there any way to recover my OS Keyboard Shortcuts from a backup of my previous codeUser/code folder?  Is is somewhere in codeLibrary/Preferences/code?  I tried copying code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code (based on another thread here) but that did not seem to work.  (I'm referring to various shortcuts set up in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts, particularly  'App Shortcuts')  <answer237209> See Where are keyboard shortcuts stored (for backup and sync purposes)? which mentions some relevant files in code~/Library/code.  (Also helpful: Globally edit all keyboard shortcut settings  – which talks about manually adding/editing shortcuts.)  Copying code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code from my old account worked, however, I had to log out and do it from a separate account, otherwise OSX will undo any changes to the file.  <comment290511> not true, see below
