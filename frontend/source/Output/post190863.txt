How do you completely disable the space-switching animations in OS X Yosemite? <body> Is there a way to completely disable the animations when switching from one space to another in Yosemite? Everything I have found so far is for previous versions of OS X.  I have tried all of these without success:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-swoosh-animation-off -bool YES defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -int 0; killall Dock defaults write com.apple.dock space-animation-duration -int 0; killall Dock /code/pre  I want to avoid installing a tool like TotalSpace if possible.  <answer241773> You can't.   You emcan/em change the speed of switching into Mission Control. To do that in terminal Run:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -int 0; killall Dock /code/pre  To switch back to defaults run:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration; killall Dock /code/pre  <comment240067> are you trying to disable spaces altogether or just the animation when switching spaces?
