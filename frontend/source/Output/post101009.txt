Applescript sub-procedure problem <body> I would like to display a comma-delimited list of values in a codeList/code.  Unfortunately, I get an error that reads codeMicrosoft Outlook got an error: Canâ€™t continue joinList./code when I attempt to use the sub-procedure that performs the join:  precodetell application "Microsoft Outlook"   ...   set addressList to {}   repeat with theAddress in the theAddresses     if addressList does not contain (address of theAddress) then       set addressList to addressList &amp; (address of theAddress)     end if   end repeat    display dialog joinList(addressList, ";") &lt;-- error here   ... end tell  on joinList(aList, delimiter)     set retVal to ""     set prevDelimiter to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to delimiter     set retVal to aList as string     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to prevDelimiter     return retVal end joinList /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer101012> The code should have been:  precodedisplay dialog my joinList(addressList, ";")  /code/pre
