What is my MacBook's firmware password after using setregproptool? <body> In attempting to automate setting up firmware passwords through DeployStudio, I accidentally wrote a bad script loosely based off Dash's post Setting a firmware password that did not work as intended.  precode#!/bin/sh     diskutil mount Recovery\ HD &amp; wait hdiutil attach -quiet -nobrowse /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg &amp; wait OLDPASSWORD= "" CONFIRMPASSWORD= "password" /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/Applications/Utilities/Firmware\ Password\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources/setregproptool -m command -p $CONFIRMPASSWORD -o $OLDPASSWORD diskutil unmount force Recovery\ HD &amp; wait echo "New Firmware Password is Set" /code/pre  If you can tell already, when setting the variables for OLDPASSWORD and CONFIRMPASSWORD, I should not have added that extra space because I got "command not found" errors.  However, I ran the script through DeployStudio (Postponed execution not checked) and a password WAS set. I just don't know what it is. I tried "password" and empty password. Does anyone have an idea what it could be? The only this else I could do is send the macbook to Apple Repair.  <answer271961> Since OLDPASSWORD and CONFIRMPASSWORD are both unset, the command your script executed was:  precode/Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/Applications/Utilities/Firmware\ Password\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources/setregproptool -m command -p -o /code/pre  I don't know for certain (and I'm not about to test it), but I'd expect that this has taken "-o" as an argument to the "-p" option, and hence set the firmware password to "-o".  BTW, in addition to removing the spaces after the "=" in assignments, you should also double-quote all references to variables, like this:  precode/Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/Applications/Utilities/Firmware\ Password\ Utility.app/Contents/Resources/setregproptool -m command -p "$CONFIRMPASSWORD" -o "$OLDPASSWORD" /code/pre  This will prevent the shell from doing weird things with variables that contain spaces and/or wildcards, or are blank (like codeOLDPASSWORD/code in your script).  <comment341856> kenorb was only the post's editor. The script was written by Dash. <comment342216> Thank you, that did the trick :)
