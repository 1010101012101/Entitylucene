How do I create a Mac bootable USB drive using Windows? <body> My MBA 2012 with OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks won't boot anymore - it simply freezes after the initial jingle. I already tried resetting NVRAM and SMC, but to no avail. I don't have any time machine backups.  However, I still have a disc image of Mavericks sitting on an external hard drive, a USB stick and access to a notebook with Windows 7.   I haven't yet found any tutorial on stronghow to create a bootable USB drive on Windows in order to reinstall OS X on my beloved Macbook Air./strong  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  <answer142205> According to the first answer here, https://superuser.com/questions/383235/create-a-bootable-usb-drive-from-a-dmg-file-on-windows, there's a tool with a free trial called TransMac that can do it. Just make sure the USB drive is formatted with GPT and not MBR.  What might be easier, however, is that that model has support for Internet Recovery. If you boot holding Command-R and you have a WiFi connection, it can actually boot into recovery mode without a recovery partition on a drive (or even without a working drive).   Having said that, your description of a crash right after the boot chime could signify a more serious hardware problem and you may not be able to boot anything. If you boot holding the option key down, the startup disk selection screen should appear. If it crashes anyways, you may be looking at a hardware problem.  <answer159780> I was able to do this with Power ISO on Windows but it cost me $29.99  -- I created an ISO from the original install DVD and then went to tools = Create Bootable USB... Selected the OSX image Selected the USB drive to create the bootable image on Selected RAW mode  I popped it in my Desklamp iMac (DVD Drive busted from toddlers -- majority of OS was trashed by 5yo) and boom ready to install.  <answer173668> In my humble opinion, the easiest and a free solution for creating bootable drives is Rufus.  <answer194907> I've been struggling with the same problem but this works for me:  ol liconvert the .dmg image with power iso to iso/li liput the iso on a usb stick (drag it into your mac hard drive and mount it)/li liformat your usb stick with the disk utility tool. (Make sure the usb is partitioned as mac bootable then use use the image recovery and put your mounted OS X iso into the source and your usb as the location.) /li lirestart your computer while holding down the option key/li /ol  <answer234155> I know this question is old but it is still valid. I was never able to write a Mac installer image to my Flash Drive and have it bootable, unless I did it on a Mac. Using Michael D. M. Dryden's Link, I was able to use the Diskpart command to clean and prep a GPT partition on a flash drive for an OSX Mavericks install image.  I used TransMac on Windows 7 to restore the image file I had to the Flash Drive, it created a bootable Mac image on my flash drive. Someone had reported that the method for using DISKPART did not work, but I have done this twice and it works remarkably well, and it's the only method I could find to create a Mac-Bootable Flash. I've been trying to post this to confirm that it works for some time, I just hope it helps someone else, because it is a very easy solution.  Here are the Diskpart commands used to prep the Flash Drive, just to have them here in case my Link does not work:  precodediskpart DISKPART&gt; list disk /code/pre  (Find the disk number)  precodeDISKPART&gt; select disk x (from result of List Disk) /code/pre  Disk x is now the selected disk.  precodeDISKPART&gt; clean /code/pre  DiskPart succeeded in cleaning the disk.  precodeDISKPART&gt; convert gpt /code/pre  DiskPart successfully converted the selected disk to GPT format.  precodeDISKPART&gt; create partition primary /code/pre  Note: I use "Rufus" for all other USB writing and formatting for Windows systems, it's a great app, but I had previously tried to format the drive as GPT using that, as a Fat32 partition. When I tried to inject the image, Transmac told me that the drive was "write protected". So basically, the USB drive cannot have any high level formatting, the Windows system should detect the drive as "not formatted" for this to work, which it will if prepped right with Diskpart.  <answer247952> You can create bootable USB drive on Windows using POWER ISO. You will be able to download a copy of old one version of powerISO by provided links this tutorial.  You need pen drive of more than 8 GB.  http://www.makarandmane.com/computer/tips-and-tricks/apple-mac-os-x/create-bootable-usb-mac-os-x-installer-from-windows/  <answer266292> I've tried many tutorials on how to create a mac bootable USB drive from Windows but none of them worked. So, I've come up with my own solution that worked fine with any DMG I've tested. Please find the details on my github page.  <comment167521> possible duplicate of [How can i initiate os x installaion from a dmg in windows on a Mac?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/142060/how-can-i-initiate-os-x-installaion-from-a-dmg-in-windows-on-a-mac) <comment167531> Thanks for your response. However, the problem differs from the one you linked to since I do not want to run an OS X installation in Windows (running in bootcamp) on a Mac. <comment167533> What I want to do to is easily achievable using *createinstallmedia* or Disk Utility. (see http://www.macworld.com/article/2056561/how-to-make-a-bootable-mavericks-install-drive.html) But since I do not have access to another mac, I am looking for a way to get this done in Windows. <comment167534> The question asked is about how to create a bootable Mac installing USB in the windows embitterment. Basically your question seems to ask the same thing. <comment167535> Yes, more or less. However, the answer provided isn't helpful in my case I'm afraid. Neither do I have a recovery partition available, nor another osx. In fact, that is exactly the problem at hand. I tried using PowerISO, but my Mac doesn't recognize the USB stick afterwards unfortunately. <comment232623> The problem is, Mavericks is not a .dmg file.  Yes, buried within the .app file is an InstallESD.dmg file, however it alone does not contain all of the necessary files to install OS X.  You used to be able to burn InstallESD.dmg in 10.8 and prior, this changed with 10.9.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 <comment278701> And also the question is about creating bootable USB flash from Windows.  Your way is obviously for Mac. <comment305974> To create bootable OS X pen drive in windows just check this simple tutorial. http://www.makarandmane.com/computer/tips-and-tricks/apple-mac-os-x/create-bootable-usb-mac-os-x-installer-from-windows/ <comment333936> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
