How can I add an Old English dictionary to Dictionary? <body> Is there a way to add an Old English dictionary to the Dictionary app?  I would like to three-finger-tap a word that's Old English and have it translate it for me.  For pure adventure I want to read Beowulf in its original Old English form.  I was all excited to use Dictionary to help me through each word, and was kinda surprised when it didn't know practically any word in it at all.  If I open Dictionary and search a word (such as HWÃ†T), it does actually return some related words because their emorigin/em is the Old English word.  Any ideas?  <answer176814> Adding dictionaries is possible.  Finding the one you want may not be.  See  http://clasquin-johnson.co.za/michel/mac-os-x-dictionaries/index.html  For info on creating dictionaries for dictionary.app, see  How can I create a dictionary for Mac OS X?  How to add wiktionary as a source to the default dictionary.app?  <comment208880> Dictionary app? <comment209131> Command + Space, type Dictionary.  I don't know any other way to load it except to three-finger tap a word. :) <comment209549> Control plus click on a word should give you a dialogue to look it up.
