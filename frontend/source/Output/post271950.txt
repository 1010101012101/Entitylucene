Virtual ergonomic keyboard for ipad pro? <body> Is there a virtual ergononmic keyboard available for the ipad pro?  I am coming from a Windows background and am happy with the physical Ergonomic Keyboard series from MS.  However when using the ipad pro, I would like to use it with a virtual keyboard, so it's easily portable.  <answer271975> If by ergonomic keyboard you mean a emsplit/em keyboard, you can do this natively on the iPad.  To do this:  ul liIn the bottom right corner of the keyboard there is a key with a keyboard icon (with a black down arrow)/li liTap and hold that key/li liA toggle for the split keyboard will pop up (or, if it's already split, a choice to unsplit the keyboard will appear instead)/li /ul  strongNOTE:/strong If the above steps don't work, first go to Settings  General  Keyboard and toggle the emSplit Keyboard/em option on.  <comment341845> Have you done a search on "ergonomic keyboard" in the App Store?
