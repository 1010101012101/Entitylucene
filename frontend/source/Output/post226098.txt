Batch modifying file metadata <body> I'm looking for an application or command line tool that can batch edit file metadata. I have some audio files recorded using a recorder that was off by 1 hour, and I want to strongmodify the creation date/strong to the correct time.  <answer242149> You can use "touch -mt YYYYMMDDhhmm" followed by your file name/path, of course replacing YYYYMMDDhhmm with your desired date.  I recommend typing "man touch" into terminal to look at the manual and different command options there.  <comment274641> This has command line, but I'm not sure how you'd batch "-1 hour" - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99536/changing-creation-date-of-a-file
