Port listening without a process <body> This is a problem that has happened to me twice now. On OS 10.9.2.  I was running a program in Java 7u51 and for some reason it hung when trying to shutdown a TCP socket it had opened. I had to kill the java process (can't remember which signal I used, but TERM didn't work).  The problem is that the ports the Java program was listening on remain open and listening, and so I can't restart the program because it says the ports are in use. One of the ports is 9004:  precode% sudo netstat -n -p tcp -a  | grep 9004 tcp46      0      0  *.9004                 *.*                    LISTEN /code/pre  I can even connect to it:  precodenc -v localhost 9004                                                  ✔ 0  found 0 associations found 1 connections:      1: flags=82&lt;CONNECTED,PREFERRED&gt;     outif lo0     src ::1 port 52535     dst ::1 port 9004     rank info not available     TCP aux info available  Connection to localhost port 9004 [tcp/*] succeeded! where is this going? ^C /code/pre  But emthere isn't a process listening to that port/em. lsof can't see it:  precodesudo lsof -n -P -i TCP | grep 9004 /code/pre  gives nothing. And there's no java processes running now. The only way I've been able to free the port is to reboot.  It would seem that either the Java code or the JVM itself is putting things into a bad state. But it seems so bizarre that this is possible. Where is the kernel sending the packets when there's no process to receive them?  I am at a loss as to how to fix this problem, or avoid it. Anyone have any ideas?
