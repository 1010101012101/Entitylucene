Sign in to ** to update application for that account <body> So I somehow grabbed my parents USB thumb drive to install Mountain Lion. Now when I want to upgrade to Mavericks, its asking me to sign into my parents icloud account.   So I rebooted, did an Internet Recovery, and it installed a clean version of Mountain Lion. It's prompting me again still.  How can I re-associate my Mac Mini to my icloud account?  <answer130915> these are sort of "nuke from orbit" directions; there's likely a less extreme way, but this should work:  ul lishutdown/li liboot to single-user mode by holding down kbdâŒ˜ command/kbd-kbds/kbd on boot/li lienter these commands at the console  precodefsck -fy mount -uw / rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone shutdown -r now /code/pre/li lirun through the Setup Assistant creating a new administrator account/li /ul
