Automated DVD burning from a .dmg (DVD video) <body> So I am looking for a solution which meets these requirements, I have various searches and not found exactly what im looking for.  So the history. once a year I film school plays and build a DVD and sell them (via the school) to the parents. now I normally get around 50 orders and burning these disks one at a time is a very long and boring process. I am using toast right now and have to hit burn each time (as when using the option to burn more than one fails each time tried on different Macs).   I would like something of the following I create the DVD Video_TS folders and can create a .DMG I would like to be able to put in a blank DVD and it burns it then spits it out so I can do the next one and so forth. If I added more USB burners it would be able to use them as well.  So a little script that detects a blank DVD inserted and runs through the burn and ejects to do the next one.  I have an old mac mini which could be headless and sat next to me while im doing other things would be the best use of it as I can have 3/4 usb drives attached as well.  Any help would be great
