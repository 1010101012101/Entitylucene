Smart Folder not picking up images in subfolders <body> Until recently I used this excellent tip, to create a (smart) folder on my mac showing all the screenshots that I have taken with my iPhone (via the iPhoto directory system and photostream). This was on Lion.  I'm now using a new harddrive with a fresh install of Mavericks on it, and when I try to repeat the tip I get nowhere.   I can see the directory structure in   precode/Users/josephreddington/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub /code/pre  as it was before, and it looks just like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wuxZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  So all the files are there, but when I put try and search for kind=png, I oddly get exactly one result:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GJHUb.png" alt="enter image description here"  rather than hundreds.  I get no results at all when searching for kind=jpg, and that should pick up all of the camera photos in the subfolders - what am I doing wrong?   (This also is the case if the search is saved and accessed later)  or even
