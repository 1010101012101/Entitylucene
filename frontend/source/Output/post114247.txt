Compare Apache Settings on Different Machines? <body> Is there a way to easily compare the Apache settings for two machines? I have a MacBook Air and an iMac, both running 10.9.1. On both machines, I am trying to run a site via localhost.  ~/Sites/foo.loc  On the MacBook Air, the site runs as expected.  On the iMac, the site gives me a 403 Forbidden message.  There is no difference between the two sites.   I am using VirtualHostX 4.2.1 to load the site via http://foo.loc/ and both machines are using the built-in Apache.  strongUPDATE:/strong  Found the apachectl configtest command and it's giving me two error messages on the iMac:  precodeSyntax error on line 15 of /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf:  Syntax error on line 472 of /private/etc/apache2/users/httpd.conf:  /code/pre  Each repeated at least 58 times.   Looked at both lines and nothing stands out. One line points the system to the other.  strongUPDATE NO. 2/strong  Line 471 and 472 from /private/etc/apache2/users/httpd.conf  precode# User home directories Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf /code/pre  And complete contents of /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-userdir.conf  precode# Settings for user home directories # # Required module: mod_userdir  # # UserDir: The name of the directory that is appended onto a user's home # directory if a ~user request is received.
