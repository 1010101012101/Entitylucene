Can Mac system updates recover accidentally deleted kernel files? <body> We commonly know that system updates will fix the kernel defects that have been discovered or not previously disclosed, to make the OS more secure.  However, what if I accidentally deleted some kernel files, will a new system update recovers the kernel files I deleted?  <answer177004> Most likely not. They may be a completely new file, but in general updates are just patches to the already existing file.  <answer177007> System updates (on any system) only modify strongtargeted/strong files which need improvment or removal.  They might strongaccidentally/strong repair a file you have damaged. They might also strongaccidentally/strong damage a file you have fixed. But this isn't their target.  A strongfull install/strong will of course reinstall any file you removed.  <comment209251> How about prestigious anti-virus software? Will that recover the kernels (recover modified kernel files), maybe? <comment209280> Not at all! This is none of their business. They don't have a database of all the correct versions of kernel files. The operating system editors have already some difficulties to maintain such a database due to the sustained rythm at which they blitz new versions and fixes. <comment209281> Do you precisely know which kernel files you accidentally removed? <comment209282> So, if my kernel is compromised, the only option is to back up the whole data, and reinstalled the operating system? <comment209283> Actually, I am learning Operating System course, this question just came in my mind. I am thinking about in case kernel is compromised, how kernel can be recovered. @danielAzuelos <comment209295> If your kernel is compromised, don't do any backup :(. <comment209296> This is a pretty good and difficult question.
