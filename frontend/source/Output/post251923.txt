Headphones are not working after sleep (internal speakers work) <body> I've got an early 2013 MacBookPro with OS X El Capitan 10.11.4 (This Bug was already there before the upgrade to El Captian)  With a fresh restart my headphones work fine (plugged in with the 3.5 mm jack, not USB) and even when I unplug them and don't turn the mac to sleep and plug them in again they work fine. But as soon as I put the Mac to sleep with plugged in Headphones or not, my Headphones won't show up in the output list after I wake the Mac up again. I hope my problem is clear and there is some solution to it, because this is getting annoying...   I've already done the NVRAM Reset
