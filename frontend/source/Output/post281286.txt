MBP Retina 2015: Graphical glitches after update to 10.12.4 <body> my Macbook Pro has random graphical glitches. Most of the time they are present in Spotify, and less often in Chrome. An example of such glitches is on the photo attached.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hE3pR.jpg" alt="Spotify Glitches"  Is there a known solution to this problem?   <answer282792> You're not alone (see this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7908354?start=0&amp;tstart=0). I had the same artifacts and reverting to 10.12.3 "solved" everything. Let's hope this bug will be fixed with the release of MacOS 10.12.5 (sadly, I doubt it).  <comment353917> Is that a screenshot or a picture? If that is a picture, see if the glitches appear in screenshots as well <comment353918> It's a screenshot.
