What are the physical dimensions of the SSD used in the MacBook Air? <body> I need the dimensions of the "gum-stick" SSD (solid-state drive) used in 2011 MacBook Air models, preferably in cm or mm.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OhPlv.jpg" alt="Macbook Air SSD"  <answer49007> A HREF="http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-apple-macbook-air-2011-11-inch/6291537?seq=21" rel="nofollow"Techrepublic/A says as part of their tear-down the part number is Samsung MZ-CPA1280/0A2. This part is A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.jp/SAMSUNG%E8%A3%BD-MacBook-%E4%BA%A4%E6%8F%9B%E7%94%A8SSD-MZ-CPA1280-0A2-%E8%BC%B8%E5%85%A5%E5%93%81/dp/B006OG1KDU" rel="nofollow"available on Amazon JP/A where its dimensions are specified as "Size : 24.0 × 3.9 × 108.9mm"  <comment56079> If you need them to be that precise, perhaps you need to disassemble your MacBook Air, remove the module, and measure it with calipers yourself. <comment56080> See if there is any data at http://iFixit.com. <comment56083> @WheatWilliams I'm not asking for extra precision, just for measures in [SI units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units). iFixit only gives the thickness of the drive: 2.45 mm. I need the width/length, and I still don't have the pentalobe screwdriver to open my MBAs. <comment56085> You could also check with Other World Computing at http://macsales.com. And either Other World or iFixit would be glad to sell you a pentalobe screwdriver. :-) <comment56088> Can I be curious? Why do you need to know that? :) <comment56093> @MartínMarconcini You can be curious... I might wand to fit a few of these into a different device. <comment56099> Great find! Thank you! <comment56699> @Coyote :) thanks. It was just curiosity.
