iPad: H.264 vs MPEG 4? <body> On the Apple website it is said that       Camera Connection Kit support standard photo formats, including JPEG   and RAW, along with SD and HD video formats, including H.264 and   MPEG-4.     aren't H.264 and MPEG4 the same thing? I thought that there are two names only because different standard consortiums have different terminology.  <answer56441> With MPEG-4 you generally mean H.263, the predecessor of H.264. It has lower compression and therefore lower image quality at same bit rate.  <answer56443> H.264 = MPEG-4 AVC = MPEG-4 Part 10
