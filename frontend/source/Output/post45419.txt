How can I navigate to individual windows? <body> I have many many apps running in the background some are infact two or three windows of same program, i.e. Firefox 3-4 windows and Xcode 3-4 windows etc...  I know that I can switch using kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd but that only switches on programs and I want to go to each individual window.  I've tried spotlight and it's not what im looking for. Also, I do not prefer to install any paid software and would like to use build in features if possible.  <answer45420> To switch between windows of the same application, use kbd⌘/kbd + kbd~/kbd.  If you need a shortcut like the Windows' kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd that switches between all open windows, you can set one in your System Preferences - Keyboard Shortcuts as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlzLy.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts"  As you can see above, the default is kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdF4/kbd, which actually means you need to press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdFn/kbd+kbdF4/kbd because of the special meaning of the function keys. You could change it to any unused key combination, e.g. kbdAlt/kbd+kbdTab/kbd itself.  <answer45426> There are several options to navigate between windows build right into OSX.

Look up the [most upvoted questions](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) on this site. <comment51843> out interest how do you do page up and page down in a document i.e.if i press ctrl page up in eclipse it goes top of page and if i press ctrl page down it goes last line on page. <comment51853> @codejunkie: I'm not sure which shortcuts you're referring to, but the equivalent of the Windows' PageUp/Down is Fn+Up/Down Arrow. The equivalent of Home/End is Fn+Left/Right Arrow.
