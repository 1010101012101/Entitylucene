Can I restore an application by application switching to it? <body> When you kbdcommand/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to an application that is minimized it doesn't bring it forward, is it possible to make it so it gets restored?  <answer29265> With the minimized application selected, start holding the kbd⌥ alt/kbd key before you release the kbd⌘ cmd/kbd key.  <comment33597> I don't think this is possible unless you want to hack it by creating a script that always runs and checks if the front application has a minimized widow. I can write an Applescript that would do this if you want ? Otherwise, have you tried hiding the window/app instead of minimizing it ? (command+H) <comment33609> Well the certainly works in brining the window forward, though a pre-requisite is that I need to be aware the window is minimized to begin with which is to bad.
