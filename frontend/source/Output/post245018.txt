How do I enable a USB SuperDrive in Mac OS X El Capitan on a MacBook Pro? <body> I have an older MacBook Pro (Late 2011) which came with a built-in optical drive. I replaced the built-in SuperDrive with a second hard drive. However, the USB SuperDrive is not compatible with Macs that came with built-in optical drives.  I tried modifying the code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist/code file with the codembasd=1/code flag as I would have in Yosemite/Mavericks. However, I was presented with an codeOperation not permitted/code message, even when I tried this as root. (As it turns out, this is because of the new System Integrity Protection introduced in El Capitan, which supersedes root)  Is it possible to get a USB SuperDrive working in El Capitan? If so what are the steps?  <answer245019> I discovered this is a fast and simple way to enable a USB SuperDrive on El Capitan:  ol liClick on the "" (Apple) menu, select "Restart...", and then hold "⌘" (Command) and "R" at the same time until the progress bar appears. em[This will boot El Capitan in recovery mode, which may take a little longer than usual.]/em/li liOnce booted into the GUI, click on the "Options" menu, and select "Terminal"./li liType codecsrutil disable/code, and then press return. em[This will temporarily disable System Integrity Protection, which is only possible in recovery mode. This will allow us to modify the restricted *.plist file.]/em/li liType codeplutil -convert xml1 /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist/code, and then press return./li liType codevi /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot.plist/code, and then press return./li liAdd the codembasd=1/code flag to the "Kernel Flags" string, and save the file. It should look like the file below:/li /ol  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Kernel Flags&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;mbasd=1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  ol start="7" liType codecsrutil enable/code, and then press return./li liType codeshutdown -r now/code, and then press return./li /ol  Once the system has restarted, you should now be able to use your USB SuperDrive.  <answer245205> Try this?  precodesudo nvram boot-args="mbasd=1" /code/pre  <comment302059> doesn't it 'just work'? we bought a USB SuperDrive and it works just fine whichever MacBook Pro we plug it in to.. <comment302166> @JBRWilkinson Hmm, it never worked for me; however, I have a Late 2011 MacBook Pro which came with a built-in optical drive... Until I replaced it with an SSD and needed an external one :P It seems USB SuperDrives are only compatible with Macs that did not come with a built in optical drive: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202665 <comment302254> Welcome to Ask Different.
