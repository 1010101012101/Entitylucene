"Verification Required" when installing free apps? <body> When I tried to install a free app, AppStore says:     strongVerification Required/strong      Before you can make purchases, you must tap Continue to sign in, then   verify your payment info.   I never had this problem before. How do I install free apps without providing Apple with my credit card information?  <answer94433> It is indeed possible to create an Apple ID without a credit card, see "Creating an iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store account without a credit card" at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2534.  If you entered credit card information in the past you can dissociate it from your Apple ID as follows.  strongOn an iOS device/strong  ol liOpen Settings./li liTap iTunes &amp; App Stores:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IcVkI.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liTap your account and select "View Apple ID"./li liSelect codePayment information/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zsted.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect codeNone/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmzkT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liConfirm with codeDone/code./li /ol  strongOn a Mac/strong  ol liOpen App Store.app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4BYQj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect menu StoreView My Account./li liIn the Apple ID Summary section locate the Payment Information line and click codeEdit &gt;/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyBOj.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect codeNone/code as payment method:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HWLvD.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aw5d9.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick codeDone/code to confirm./li /ol  If you don't see a "none" option, you may need to disable family sharing and then try the above steps again.     <comment110698> I'd say this is a generic message, do you actually have to enter your credit card information when you go through the verification steps? It is indeed possible to create an Apple ID without a credit card, see "Creating an iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store account without a credit card" at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2534. <comment110700> @jaume it shows me the last 4 digits of my credit card, without me entering anything. I already have an apple ID, is there any way to disassociate all credit card information with apple so that they won't bother me with credit card issues (like this) again? <comment110702> Yes, you can do that, see my answer below for details. <comment110704> Does windows have an App Store.app? Are there ways to do it simply through a browser? <comment110706> No, you must do it from your Mac. You can also use an iOS device, there is a similar procedure for iPhone/iPad: Open  Settings, tap iTunes & App Stores, tap your account and select "View Apple ID", select "Payment information" and select "None". Confirm with `Done`. <comment110709> thanks it's working. That should have been the answer though, since not everyone with an iPhone has a mac. <comment110720> That's true, I just thought the verification message came from the **Mac** App Store, a wrong assumption from my part. I've edited the answer and added a section for iOS devices. <comment313044> This works indeed. I never had entered any payment data ("None" was selected from beginning on). But I was asked to confirm my payment info even for free apps, although it was still set to "None". I think this happens, because I'm have logged in with a completely another account but which has credit card info entered. I guess that even when logging out and in with an account without payment info, the app store / itunes stores the info in a cache or so, so it must be updated by re-saving your account information. Now it works for me too. So if you still have problems: update your account info.
