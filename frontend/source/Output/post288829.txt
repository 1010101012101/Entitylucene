"The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk" error in bootcamp macOS Sierra <body> strongProblem:/strong   I can no longer boot Boot Camp partition (BCP) running Windows 10 Pro 1703. I am also unable to start Parallels 12.2.0 Virtual Machine based on the same BCP macOS side. Problem occurred suddenly without warning. I cannot isolate any action from user side that could have led to this situation. I did emnot/em try to resize partition. I would like to boot from internal BCP as I was able to a few hours ago if possible. I do have a backup saved disc image (WinClone 6) from a few weeks back and a backup I made after the issue began. I would like to avoid a solution where I have to clone BCP to external SSD and transfer it back to notebook.  strongMac Notebook Specs:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YTs7.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongcodediskutil list/code Output:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9w9X.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongcodediskutil cs list/code Output:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SphGS.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongDisk Utility Report:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YS5XF.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X4ak7.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongVirtual Machine Output:/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Nsy4.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liBCP is Not Visible at Startup (was few hours back)/li liBCP is Visible in Startup Disk in Preferences without Paragon NTFS for Mac 15.0.828 installed (but cannot restart from BCP disk)/li liBCP is Not Visible in Startup Disk in Preferences withbr Paragon NTFS for Mac 15.0.828 installed (but cannot restart from BCP disk using NTFS for Mac)/li liBCP is mountable/visible on Desktop /li liDisk Utility not allowing me to verify/repair disk (grayed out/dimmed selection for applying First Aid to BCP)/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TJMiW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongTroubleshooting Steps:/strong  ul liHOLD ALT at Restart (x3) - Only macOS partition visible/li liCMD+R (Recovery Mode) + Verify + BCP select restart - "The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk"/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TIxIc.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2OIWg.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6osz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ul liALT+CMD+R+P (Reset NVRAM) - No resolution/li liVerify disk using Paragon NTFS for Mac 15.0.828 - Success:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xqedh.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liRepair disk using Paragon NTFS for Mac 15.0.828 - Success:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9pjSE.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liALT+CMD+R+P (Reset NVRAM) - No resolution:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jyskg.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liGoogle/li liMade post on stack exchange /li liMade appt for Genius Bar/li /ul  strong07/05/17 Update:/strong  strongcodediskutil verifyDisk disk0/code/strong:  precodeStarted partition map verification on disk0 Checking prerequisites Checking the partition list Checking the partition map size Checking for an EFI system partition Checking the EFI system partition's size Checking the EFI system partition's file system Checking the EFI system partition's folder content Checking all HFS data partition loader spaces Checking booter partitions Checking booter partition disk0s3 Verifying file system Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume Checking extents overflow file Checking catalog file Checking multi-linked files Checking catalog hierarchy Checking extended attributes file Checking volume bitmap Checking volume information The volume Recovery HD appears to be OK File system check exit code is 0 Checking Core Storage Physical Volume partitions Verifying storage system Checking volume disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group CAF0EF87-18B3-429E-B956-071C41913E1E on 1 device disk0s2: Scan for Metadata Volume Logical Volume Group has a 24 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume Load and verify ABA4E795-98B7-41CB-B45B-2A85180C8204 Load and verify C37D4F73-4CF7-4E22-BD12-732A22ECD7EA Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid Load and verify Segment Cleaning The volume CAF0EF87-18B3-429E-B956-071C41913E1E appears to be OK Storage system check exit code is 0 The partition map appears to be OK Finished partition map verification on disk0 /code/pre  strongcodesudo fdisk /dev/disk0/code:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXaFD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer289208> I was able to resolve macOS Sierra error about the bless tool by using the pictured setting on WinClone 6.0.3. I did not restore from winclone backup but rather just made my BCP bootable as an EFI instead of legacy BIOS drive. For some reason macOS started to view BCP as an unbootable legacy BIOS drive. My guess is installing Paragon suite of tools like NTFS, Hard Disk Manager, and ExtFS for Mac had this sudden and unintended result during the runtime environment.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7EWb8.png" alt="enter image description here"  To prevent BSOD sysprep appears to be necessary when restoring WinClone backups on external drives.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uzl1f.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   <comment364881> Windows 10 1607 installed using BootCamp Assistant. I have to believe partition made was Master Boot Record (MBR) not GUI Partition Table (GPT) since I always intended to boot Win10 from BCP. I upgraded to 1703 Creators Update at the recommendation of Windows Technical Support to resolve problem with installing compatibility .NET Frameworks 3.5 (2.0 and 3.0 included) but this was several weeks ago. No start up problems until yesterday. Boot times are usually fast. <comment364882> I posted output to diskutil verify disk0. I don't see any info on disk0s4 and disk0s5? <comment364918> *Verify disk0* seems ok. You should be able to get the install method by entering `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. If you get one entry it's probably GPT. If you get four entries it's probably MBR. On a MBP 2016 usually (often?) the GPT method is used. Check some answers of [David](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/107222/david-anderson). He is the specialist for BC related stuff here, wasn't seen for 8 months though. Hint: please post text output (like the result of *verifyDisk*) as formatted text. Then it's much easier to copy and paste stuff like UUIDs etc. <comment364924> @klanomath There are indeed four entries but three of them are "unused"? I've added inline code formatted text where appropriate. Also since I don't know if this is a macOS or Windows hiccup I tried using windows tools to repair BCP: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/288931/advanced-troubleshooting-tips-for-macos-sierra-boot-camp-partition-bcp <comment364926> Unused entries are no entries ;-). Consequently it's a GPT install... [How do I repartition my Mac to get rid of my dual boot setup?](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/192437/93229)  Update 1  second text box *(sudo fdisk /dev/disk2)* shows a typical MBR with a Boot Camp partition installed via MBR method. <comment364932> "I would like to avoid a solution where I have to clone BCP to external SSD and transfer it back to notebook." I hope someone else is able to provide such a solution, but given the amount of time you've clearly already lost on troubleshooting, a backup + reformat seems like it would be the most efficient option. <comment365089> @klanomath I understand this is a GPT install on an EFI partition. But I've been able to successfully boot into Windows for several months. So why do you think I can't boot the disk? <comment365090> @Quesop I assume that a Windows update is the culprit or some Parallels + Windows + new Win update interaction. <comment365092> @klanomath This is why I wanted to perform a system restore. But I run into a "you must specify which windows installation to restore" error warning. 7th screenshot here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/288931/advanced-troubleshooting-tips-for-macos-sierra-boot-camp-partition-bcp <comment365093> @Quesop You should probably use the [Anniversary Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018812/new-install-of-windows-10-creators-update-on-mac-with-boot-camp) <comment365173> I needed the Creators Windows to run an application windows side. There was no helping the upgrade. I just realized I didn't make a block based backup of the BCP in winclone. I may not be able to recover from the backups after all. Not good.

Copy all important files to external drive, reinstall Windows / Bootcamp, copy back. Yes it's a pain; I suspect it will save time in the long run.
