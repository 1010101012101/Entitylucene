How do I get rid of the clock in the menu-bar in Mac OSX? <body> I want to get rid of the clock menu display in Mac OSX. How can this be done?  <answer58459> Hold kbd&#x2318;/kbd and drag it out of the menu. If date and weekday are shown, they will also be removed.  Alternatively, you can disable and customize the clock in:br emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Date &amp; Time &#x2192; Clock./em  <answer58460> Go to -  strongSystem Preferences → Date &amp; Time → Clock/strong and strongUncheck/strong the show date and time in menu bar.  Done.  <answer58462> The easiest way is to hold down the kbd⌘ Command/kbd key on your keyboard and drag it out of the menu bar (you can also re-order the menu bar icons by holding the kbd⌘ Command/kbd key and dragging them around around, if you didn't know).  But, you can also go to  strong → System Preferences → Date &amp; Time → Clock/strong and uncheck "Show date and time in menu bar" if you'd rather do it that way.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNLzs.png" alt="enter image description here"
