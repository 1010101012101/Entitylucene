How do I fix the windows bootloader after it was overwritten/corrupted by Kubuntu/grub? <body> I own a MacBook Pro Mid-2015. I used Boot Camp to install Windows 10 on a 100gb partition. Everything went smoothly.. everything was fine.  Then I created a 50gb partition to install Kubuntu on. Everything was still fine. After I had installed Kubuntu, it replaced the default boot screen with grub. No issue, just hold down option at startup and replace it with rEFInd. (rEFInd was working fine before the Kubuntu install. It did not break Windows.)  Except after that, my windows partition wouldn't boot up. Well, it would, but it would give me some sort of bootloader error. I have the original install media here, just in case I need it.  The partition is NOT corrupted, and is still readable and writable by Kubuntu. However, windows just won't boot up and startup repair won't work.
