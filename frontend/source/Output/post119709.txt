Prevent iOS device from sleeping if plugged to charger <body> This is available in Developer options in Android's system Settings. I'm trying to look for an equivalent in iOS. This is great if I want the screen to be always visible for screen updates/notifications. No problem with battery since it is plugged in anyway.  Is there a Jailbreak tweak for this?  This setting applies for both plugged and unplugged. I'm looking for something specific to a plugged device.  <answer119732> In the past there was an Cydia App called ScreenDimmer.  I hope you can find this application via your iPhone and fix your problem.  One of its features:      ul   liDoesn't dim the screen if the battery is being charged./li   /ul   <answer119791> After re-Googling, I found this post on MacRumors. It's not very detailed so I'm going to place the steps to get this working on a jailbroken device:  ol liInstall SBSettings/li liGo to Activator app/li liUnder Anywhere  Power  Connected: set to Switches (Deactivate)  Auto Lock/li liUnder Anywhere  Power  Disconnected: set to Switches (Activate)  Auto Lock/li /ol  This is the first time I used Activator and my goodness, this thing is powerful.  <answer192423> Activator means I can customise my phone down to the tiniest detail so it works exactly as I want it to work.  <comment139731> Too bad this is paid though. But a good answer nonetheless. <comment139749> @radj I couldn't see anywhere that it had to be free anyway :) <comment139922> Activator is great indeed.
