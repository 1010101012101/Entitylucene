We are following the documentation from Apple link - https://help.apple.com/deployment/ios/#/apda0e3426d7  We have followed the below steps,  precode•   Created an ipa with our enterprise app provisioning profile.  •   Created a manifest file that points to ipa and png files •   Created an html with hyperlink to - itms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=https://location.company.com/sites/mobile/Files/Mobile/deploy/manifest.plist /code/pre  Hosted the html, ipa, manifest and png files in a folder in the server https://location.company.com.  The following mime type is in the web server   precode.plist -&gt; application/xml  .ipa -&gt; application/octet-stream /code/pre  We instructed our employees to access the download page, in the following way,  precode1.  Open https://location.company.com. It will as for userid and password. Need to login. 2.  Display a page which have install app link. 3.

But it is worked when I moved the plist, ipa and png files to dropbox and the link is  precodeitms-services://?action=download-manifest&amp;url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/55yozabctc2npd6/manifest.plist /code/pre  Only difference between these two what I feel is iTunes can access the link https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/55yozabctc2npd6/manifest.plist directly. But iTunes cannot directly access the link - https://location.company.com/sites/mobile/Files/Mobile/deploy/manifest.plist, as it has an authentication page in between. That means if I open a fresh browser and try to open link - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/55yozabctc2npd6/manifest.plist, it download the file in my iPhone browser. But if I try the same with the link https://location.company.com/sites/mobile/Files/Mobile/deploy/manifest.plist it ask me for user name and password.  Any help much appreciated.   <answer295557> According to this answer, any cookies required for authentication are lost during the install process, so the request to download the app (ipa file) will fail. You could try removing authentication for the link to the app, or maybe leaving the app file in Google Drive and see if that works.  <answer295565> Here is how we solved it.  The issue, I was facing was, the hyperlink to manifest.plist and ipa files are behind authentication. Can not access it directly. So our server team bypassed the URL for manifest.plist and .ipa file from the authentication.   <comment373223> Were you ever able to figure this out? I'm having the same problem, but I think it might have to do with the link to the ipa <comment373242> The issue, I was facing was, the hyperlink to manifest.plist and ipa files are behind authentication.
