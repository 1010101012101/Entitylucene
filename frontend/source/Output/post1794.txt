Where can I get a case that is also a battery for the iPhone 4? <body> I have seen ones for previous versions of the iPhone - is there one for the new iPhone though?   <answer1795> Not yet, but I found a couple that are soon to be released:  ul liiPhone 4 Fuel Max/li liEXOGEAR iPhone Battery Case/li /ul  <answer1796> I've been very pleased with my mophie "juice pack" for my first-generation iPhone and the "juice pack air" for my 3GS.  I recommend waiting for mophie to ship a battery case for the iPhone 4.  You probably won't have to wait very longâ€”I'm sure they're eager to tap the already large and fast-growing market of iPhone 4 owners.
