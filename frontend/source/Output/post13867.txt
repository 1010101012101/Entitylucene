Opening a new file in TextMate opens the last opened file as well <body> Here is a small annoyance that I have with TextMate. When I want to open a new file in TextMate when it's not running it also opens the last opened file. Now for some cases that's just nice of him to do but in most cases I end-up closing the previous file. Maybe this is a simple setup/preference issue? Any ideas?  <answer13868> It's not something you can set in the app preferences.  If you want to change this behavior, open Terminal.app and type  precodedefaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDisableSessionRestore 1 /code/pre  This will make Textmate strongnot/strong remember the last session.  Change the code1/code by code0/code if you want the default behavior.  <answer255105> This behavior is bypassed in Textmate 2 by holding shift when opening Textmate 2.
