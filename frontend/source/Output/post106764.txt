Send a message from an iPhone to a Mac <body> Is there a way to send messages from an iPhone (iOS 7.0.3) to a Mac (OS X Mavericks) to show on the screen?  For example, imagine I’m in the kitchen and I want to send a message that will show on the iMac’s screen to my son, who is upstairs in his room. Is there a way to do that?  <answer106766> you can use imessage. and with OS X Mavericks  you can take it as notifications too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2HuV.jpg" alt="notifications"     If you’re a texter, you’ll love Messages on iPhone, iPad, and iPod   touch. Now they all come with iMessage, a service that’s an even   better kind of texting. Because it’s free for you and anyone texting   over Wi-Fi using an iOS device or Mac with iMessage. And it’s   unlimited.* So say as much as you want.   i hope it helps you..  <comment125289> which iOS version iPhone and mac version you are using?
