How can I rotate my images directly from the finder? <body> I would like to rotate my images directly from the Finder.   The best would be one of these:  ul lia button to click in the menu bar of every Finder's window/li lia button to click in Quicklook/li /ul  But, if it can be done with a keyboard-shorcut, it would be fine also.  Is one of these features possible? And if yes, how can I do?  <answer120785> Yes - you can use Automator to make a service for Finder (or all applications) to perform rotation of images. Then you can assign a keyboard shortcut to that action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSTKt.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm not aware of quicklook plug-in that rotate, but that's something that might exist. Modifying finder's shortcut bar might be the least likely way to activate things, but hopefully an Automator service (or app / droplet) will do.  <comment332370> It's a good answer and seemed to fit exactly what I needed - but it seems incredibly slow. Rotating and saving in preview happens faster. In fact, rotating once in the finder using automator is slower than opening, rotating, saving and closing it in Preview. I have 8,000+ images to rotate so hopefully I'll find something that can be as quick as preview but in the Finder.
