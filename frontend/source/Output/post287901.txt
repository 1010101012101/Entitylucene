Mount a Time Machine backup disk that will not mount <body> I just plugged in my external hd via USB for a Time Machine backup. However it will not mount.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ll1Y1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've:  ul liUnplugged the hd/li liRestarted the computer/li liPlugged it back in/li /ul  When I do this, Disk Utility spins and won't load. So I then:  ul liUnplug the disk/li liOpen Disk Utility/li liPlug in the disk and that shows the image above/li /ul  When I press mount, it says the disk is already unlocked. However it will not show up.  This started after I tried repairing the volume, but it wouldn't repair. Now I can't select it.   Any options at this point other than erasing the whole HD and starting over?  <answer287905> I've had problems like this also. If you have multiple USB ports try using a different port. Also try using a different cable and a different port.  You don't want to use a flaky drive for your backup. So, yes it seems like reformatting the drive and starting over makes sense, or replace it.
