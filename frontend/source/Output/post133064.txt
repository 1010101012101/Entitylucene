Configure specific app settings via configurator? <body> I'm an app developer of educational apps.  In EDU settings, admins often use Apple Configurator to setup many iPads at once.  While I know it's possible to install my app on many iPads at once, and add settings/profiles to the device, is it possible to add configuration data to emmy app/em during the mass install?  For example, I want to provide schools with accounts for my app.  I don't want them to have to login my app on every iPad after installing -- ideally they'd enter account information once (perhaps on one iPad), and then (via Configurator?) clone that app and the authentication information to all their iPads.  Is this possible?
