how to prevent mac from changing the order of desktops <body> You may encountered the situation in which mac changes the order of desktops based on some events like alerts on a program or a web page in browser.br How could I disable this logical change?  Note: I'm using El Capitan, but I had this problem from Mavericks.  <answer214349> System Prefs  Mission Controlbr Uncheck Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wYI6I.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will fix the order of all your regular Spaces - but not Fullscreen spaces, which always seem to go to the right of existing Spaces.  <comment258786> Seems I've never looked for it precisely. It's the first options in the list. thank you. <comment282140> So annoying...thank you! <comment320594> I cannot imagine why anyone would want that to be the default.  Thanks for the solution. <comment337388> thanks! They should remove that feature, driving me mad! +1 <comment357892> This does not work for me. I have two extra monitors, and about 25% of the time after waking the Mac up from sleep, they flip Spaces. Super annoying. This has been a problem from Mavericks to now (MacOS). <comment363506> @NathanBeach it helps users that don't understand spaces, so it helps users who *need* it to be the default setting. :)
