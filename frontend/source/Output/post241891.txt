How can I use different facebook account to sign in a game on iphone? <body> I used a facebook account to sign in a game on my iphone ( the game is "top eleven"). Now I want to change the account and use another one because I have more friends in 2nd account. Already used 2nd account's username and password in setting but didn't work, even deleted facebook app and installed it again and signed in with 2nd one but when I open the game it runs with 1st one. how can I solve this problem ? thanks   <answer241918> You need to change the Facebook login in the app itself. There should be Settings somewhere within the game, and the option to "Log Out" of Facebook. Once you have logged out, you will need to link it to your 2nd Facebook account by logging into it - again - within the app itself.  <answer241922> Or you have to delete the app, install it again and sign in with your Facebook Account.
