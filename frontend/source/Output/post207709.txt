Super bad audio quality from iPhone 6s Plus speaker <body> When I use Skype on speaker on my iPhone 6s Plus with iOS 9.0.1, the sound from the speaker is horrible. I uploaded a sample to SoundCloud.  I tested this on my iPad 4, and on the same OS, no such problem exists.  I had this phone for one day, and seems like this is a hardware problem. What do you think? I had this phone for barely a weekend, so if this is a hardware problem, I will be likely to have a chance to swap with a new phone!  <answer207715> Apple generally give 72 hours for a Dead On Arrival (DOA) or Early Life Failure (ELF) swaps.   I would take it to an Apple retail store as soon as possible to have them test it.  <answer207716> I saw the same problem with my iPhone 6s Plus. I think it may be an issue with the Skype app since my FaceTime works without any issue.  <comment250619> Reboot the phone. Try turning on and off the handsfree (speaker) mode. <comment250621> @mspasov I have done that, the issue persists. <comment250624> ok, sounds like a software problem <comment250637> Does it persist when you use other apps? <comment251679> It looks like a software problem, not a hardware problem. Bad audio encoding maybe?
