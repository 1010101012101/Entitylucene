Quicksilver to email an item <body> I am trying to get the hang of Quicksilver. I have actually used it for over three years, but entirely as a simple launcher. In connection with another task I found that I needed to use it to execute an AppleScript via a hotkey. By having the features of Quicksilver brought to my attention, I have been motivated to put a bit of effort into decoding some of its other functions.  In following one of the tutorials that shows how to select a contact, then email them, I find that the "Compose Email" action seems to work. But the "Email Item ... (Compose)" acts strangely in that it defaults to picking some random file from my system. It is never even a file that has been used for a very long time.  I see that if you tab to that third pane you can type a path to the file. But what controls the original random selection?
