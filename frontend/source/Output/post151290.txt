iPhone app that allows disabling upcoming alarms <body> In Android, it's possible to dismiss an upcoming alarm before it goes off (for example, because you woke up before your alarm). Is there an iPhone alarm app that provides this functionality?  <answer151292> Siri can do it - just tell it to "Cancel Alarm"  <comment178079> "Cancelling" a repeating alarm permanently disables it. "Dismissing" an alarm only skips the next scheduled time when it would normally go off. My testing seems to show that Siri just cancels the alarm. <comment178160> ah - never tried it on a repeating alarm - I'm rarely up at the same time each day, so they're all one-offs for me.
