How can I set up Gmail on my iPhone 4S with Exchange? <body> I have set up my Gmail account to send and receive messages from my business email address over Exchange on my iPhone 4S. I receive all messages fine, but it doesn't send messages from my business email address unless I am logged into Gmail in a web browser.  <answer50305> Navigate to Settings - Mail - Default Account; check that this is set to "Exchange" and not something else.  <answer65211> http://support.google.com/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;topic=14252&amp;answer=138740  The only thing to notice is the m.google.com server address.  <comment48894> It sounds like an outgoing mail problem. You have to have a browser tab open with your Gmail account in order for it to send? It works then? <comment76797> Links may break over time.
