How to create shortcut to insert specific special character <body> I'm using some special characters like mathematical symbols in different programs like Mail or Adobe Illustrator. Of course I can open the Symbols Table, search for the needed symbol and copy&amp;paste it. Is there a way to define a shortcut to insert a specific special character?  <answer35388> Two possibilities are through creating a modified keyboard layout (which can be done manually, but is made much simpler using a program like Ukulele) or through a shortcut program like TextExpander  I use TextExpander, myself, so that c== is a shortcut on my system for ⌘, o== for ⌥, and several others, in part because I do not want to lose the symbols already mapped to the option (kbd⌥/kbd) key combinations on my keyboard.  On the other hand, remapping the kbd⌥/kbd keys to symbols different than the ones they are original configured for can be helpful and convenient for some people also, which is where Ukulele shines.  <answer35390> You can get emvery/em fast access to the symbols via the widget strongCharacterPal/strong.  Click on the needed icon in order to paste to the clipboard.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iIBlf.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sH2i5.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5J4Sh.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dx5XB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35391> You can use built-in Automator and Services. Look at my answer to the similar question.  <answer37232> Another option would be to create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as codeDefaultKeyBinding.dict/code:  precode{     "\UF704" = { // F1         "a" = (insertText:, "∀");         "2" = (insertText:, "²");     };     "~a" = (insertText:, "∀"); } /code/pre  After restarting applications, pressing kbdF1/kbdkbdA/kbd or kbd Alt ⌥ /kbd kbdA/kbd should insert "∀".  <answer181610> You may create an AppleScript that insert your character.  Then, it is possible to have this script in the Scripts menu at the right.  Then I think that, in the menu, the script can have a keyboard command.  Then you are done!  <comment40297> I'll try this, thank you! <comment215987> You mean copy to the clipboard? <comment215988> And which icon?
