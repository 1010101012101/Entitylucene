iCloud contacts not synching <body> I have a Mac, iPhone5S and iPad all running the latest OS.  A couple of days ago I updated a friends mobile number on my Mac and wanted to call her from my iPhone. I discovered this still had her old number.  I manually updated on the iPhone before going out to meet her. The iPad still has the old number. I checked https://www.icloud.com/#contacts and the new number is there.  All devices seem to be logged in to iCloud on the same account.  Why is iOS not synching, and what can I do about it?  <comment276263> That's what I would love an answer to also. Same recent 9.2 problem which is most annoying. Just with Contacts, Calendar syncing perfectly ok.
