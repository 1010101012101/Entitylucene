How to disable PDF editing in Preview app? <body> I am running OS X 10.10, Yosemite, and there is one emfeature/em which really annoys me. I know it must be useful for a lot of people but it's just not for me.  When I open a PDF document and, by habit, I keep clicking on the text while reading it. There are some areas where Preview thinks I would like to insert text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIUYh.png" alt="Preview screenshot"  As soon as this happens, the PDF document is marked emedited/em in the title bar. When I close the document, it saves (or tries to save) it, changing the modify date and other side-effects such as triggering the DropBox sync etc.  I have accidentally inserted some text in many documents because Preview doesn't ask before saving the modified copy.  I would like to disable all PDF editing features unless explicitly invoked. Is it possible to do that?  <answer154406> h3Rectangular Selection Tool/h3  A pretty poor solution to this is change the selection mode from emText Selection/em to emRectangular Selection/em in the Tools menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUCoT.png" alt="Tools menu: selection mode"  This stops you inserting random text fields, but also prevents you from selecting text, which may be equally annoying.  h3Locking the Document/h3  If the document has been saved*, you can lock it...  * em(there is a state for temporary files, e.g. email attachments you've opened directly from the email in Apple's Mail.app, where they are aware they're a temporary file, so pressing Save opens up a Save As dialog, and you cannot lock the document)/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jRpGk.png" alt="Locked document"  However, while this prevents you from editing it, if you now click in one of those places that results in a new text field, you get a rather annoying pop-up dialogue asking if you want to unlock or duplicate the document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iBQHo.png" alt="Locked document: unlock/duplicate dialogue"  So this too is not an ideal solution, because it interrupts you perhaps even more than the inadvertent-text-entry-box, but technically prevents you from editing it if the Dropbox sync or similar is the main concern.  h3Apple Feedback/h3  I suspect there isn't a simple way of disabling/re-enabling the auto-form-filling features of Preview (which are amazing when you want them!), so would suggest you send feedback to Apple on this one.  <answer167904> I have the same habit of selecting text as I'm reading. If I change anything by accident (I also tend to shuffle pages) I just push Cmd-Z and the page status goes from emEdited/em back to Normal. I just tested this with a file in Dropbox and it didn't fire (i.e. itâ€™s not saving the document if you undo before closing the window).   Not perfect, but it works for me.   <answer195707> Go under strongFile/strong-strongPrint/strong, choose strongSave as PDF/strong in the drop-down PDF menu in the stronglower left/strong corner of the dialog box. Works like a charm.  <answer243406> According to me, the best way to resolve this, is to goto System Preferences - General. Make sure "Ask to keep changes when closing documents" is selected.  This will prevent accidental changes in PDF files, as well as other files when opened by other apps.   <comment171310> This behaviour is already there in mavericks (the previous version of OSX) so it is not very much off-topic imho. <comment180992> nominated for re-opening since this is still the behaviour in the now-released Yosemite (not to mention has been an existing issue in previous versions) <comment182455> feedback sent here: https://discussions.apple.com/message/27046205 <comment233690> How does this disable editing? <comment233711> Saved file is going to be uneditable. Try it, when that worked please get back your downvote. <comment244542> @alwaysprep This answer doesn't work.  I think you've misunderstood the question. <comment262285> Cmd-Z reverts back the possibly inserted text, but does not remove the text input box, nor does it set the status back to Normal for me. Also, the Edit-Undo menu is greyed out. <comment262287> Apparently Apple does not appreciate feed-back on this, because Preview is not listed on the feedback page... <comment299748> Welcome to Ask Different.

My crafted page numbers completely disappear once it starts "editing". <comment323451> Two years later, still the same problem... (on El Capitan) Do people at Apple use their own product? <comment326749> @fishinear: If you first unselect the text box (by clicking outside it (and hoping you don't create a new text box by that)) the undo should work as described. <comment337553> This option doesn't seem to be available on Preview 9.0 (909.12) on Sierra 10.12.2.
