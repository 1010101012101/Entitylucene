XQuartz multiple libs <body> I have recently downloaded and installed the latest version of XQuartz. Now under a /opt/X11/lib/ I see two libs: libXt.6.dylib and libXt.7.dylib  The problem is that I need Quartz for some other software that can not find the lib libXt.7.dylib but instead finds libXt.6.dylib and complains of this version being not compatible. Here is the error message:  precodedyld: Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libXt.7.dylib /code/pre  Is there a way to deal with this problem? I do not dare just to delete manually the libXt.6.dylib.  <comment314753> Please add the name of the "other software"!
