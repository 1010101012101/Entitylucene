E Signature Icons on Iphone do not Link! <body> I've created an e-signature on my macbook, with images that link to the appropriate website. It works well on computers (PC and Mac), iPads... But, once it gets sent to an iPhone, the images do not link to the website. Once I click on the icons, a window pops up asking if I would like to save the images.  What is wrong?  <comment121830> I am also experiencing the same problem. Except, it's happening on my ipad AND iphone. Have you found a solution?
