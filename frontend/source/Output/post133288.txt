Use touch ID without locking your phone <body> I like to use touch fingerprint ID when in lieu of a password (when buying apps etc...), but I don't want to have to use it to unlock my phone, nor do I want a passcode lock. Is there a way to enable touch ID without locking the phone?  <answer134357> This is not possible. You need to have a passcode to use it due to the way iOS encrypts passwords. Your iTunes store password would not be encrypted if you were not using a password, even with the Touch ID sensor.  <answer237304> This is not exactly what the OP asked for, but it might partially solve the problem:br - Enrol a fingerprint and select a passcode,br - disable "iPhone Unlock",br - change "Require Passcode" to the maximum ("After 4 hours" in my case).  This will allow you to use Touch ID in Applications, but will require passcode for unlock only once in a long time.  <comment157944> If this is not a default option (please don't blame me, I have an iPhone 5) it will be much broader available in iOS 8. This was announced during the WWDC. <comment159328> @Rob I am currently running iOS 8 and it is not. Refer to my answer as to why this is not possible. <comment290513> Reference please! <comment290534> @Elist https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204587 <comment290556> Thanks @Alex, you are right. Anyway, I have a solution that might work for the OP (at least it works on iOS 9): Enrol a fingerprint and select a passcode, disable "iPhone Unlock", and then change "Require Passcode" to the maximum ("After 4 hours" in my case). <comment363224> I hear the pain of the OP. It's ridiculous that apple can't support this in 2017. I want it for my banking but not every time I want to use my phone! <comment363225> Yeah that's the closest thing I found. Still very annoying
