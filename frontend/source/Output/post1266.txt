Prevent "Sleep / Stand by" in iBooks <body> Does anyone know how to prevent the iPad from going to sleep / stand by when in the iBooks app?  I'm using the iPad as a music stand with my charts, but while I'm playing the song, the screen goes black... this (as I'm sure you can imagine) totally blows.  <answer1268> I'm not sure how to prevent sleep emonly/em in the iBooks app, but if you find yourself in a situation where you don't want your iPad to go to sleep, go into Settings - General - Auto-Lock and select "Never". With this option selected, the iPad won't go to sleep without user input.  <comment1064> +1 Thanks. This is what I've done... I just know there are other apps that can override this setting just while your in that app.
