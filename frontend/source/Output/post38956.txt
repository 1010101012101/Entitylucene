How do I set a recognized Apache DocumentRoot under Lion? <body> I have a fresh Lion install, and to configure Apache, I've edited all of the references to DocumentRoot (and the Directory entry for DocumentRoot) to "/Users/jonathan/mirror" (with or without quotes as the original path was with or without quotes). Pointing my browser to localhost gives a 404:  precodeNot Found  The requested URL / was not found on this server.  Apache/2.2.20 (Unix) DAV/2 Server at localhost Port 80 /code/pre  How can I up /Users/jonathan/mirror with appropriate permissions?  <answer38996> Things do doublecheck:  strong1. File permissions/strong  The specified path for the new document root should allow at least read access for the Apache user, which is _www by default. You probably want to codechmod 755 /Users/jonathan/mirror/code if the file permissions are too restrictive. What are the actual file permissions on the directory and files?  strong2. Virtual hosts/strong  When you enable name based virtual hosts, the document root in the main config is ignored. Instead the root for the matching hostname will be used, and if none match strongit will default to the first virtual host/strong.  <comment44104> Any reason you don't want to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info)? It's free and self contained (you don't have to mess with Apple's files) <comment44105> Never mind; I copied the httpd.conf from the old server. <comment44106> In the days of yore I was a system administrator and I usually prefer to work with things unbundled as far as Unix goes. I've had a rough experience with XAMPP sometime back. <comment44158> Did you enable virtual hosts?
