Others in Macintosh HD <body> How can I reduce the size of my HD folder? I have more than 22 GB in "others".  It is actually using more memory than my documents and apps and does not show contents. I have deleted the main info in mobileSync folder, but is still very big.  <answer124133> ul liopen your HD in the Finder and press Command-2/li lithen open view options (Command-J) and select strongcalculate all sizes/strong/li liyou can find folders with large use and expand them, focusing your attention on /Users first and clean up things that are larger than you care to have around/li /ul  <answer124143> I'm a big fan of Daisy Disk. It gives you a graphical display of the usage of your drive. It lets you delete items pretty quickly too. You can try it for free.

On the Mac there is no HD folder <comment145099> A hard disk volume may be called "HD", and represented in the Finder in the same way as a folder is represented.
