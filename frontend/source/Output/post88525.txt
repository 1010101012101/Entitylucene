Using different bluetooth mouses and keyboards on a MacBook <body> I was wondering if it is possible to get a wireless mouse and keyboard less expensive than Apple's that would still work the way Apple's do - without the need to use extra USB toggles for bluetooth connection?   My MacBook Air has only 2 USB ports and connecting a mouse and a keyboard would leave me without either one or both USB ports.   I know it might be reasonable to buy some device to get 'more' USB ports, but I'd like to find out if there are any mouses and keyboards on a market that a MacBook would recognize emwithout/em the need to use their own USB bluetooth adapters. Thanks in advance!  <answer88526> Yes, it's possible. You just need a proper mouse/keyboard that is intended to work that way (via bluetooth).br I know that logitech actually has some of these.br A quick research give me this or this.  <comment103636> Any bluetooth mouse/keyboard should work with the Mac's built in bluetooth.  I use a Logitech bluetooth mouse with my MBP.  Some are marketed as Mac specific, but even a Windows targeted Bluetooth mouse/keyboard should work. <comment103637> @Jason and you don't even use the built in USB thing? <comment103639> There is a difference between a wireless mouse/keyboard (which require their own special adapter) and a Bluetooth one (which will work with any PC/Mac that already has bluetooth). <comment103640> Is there some special reason other than price you don't want to use Apple's wireless keyboard and mouse? <comment103641> @TomGewecke yep, the price is _the_ reason
