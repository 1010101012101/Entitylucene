Disable Search / Dictionary Popup Window in iTerm2 <body> The newer versions of codeiTerm2/code have a "feature" in which a codeSearch/code dialog is displayed instead of doing a codeStart selection/code action.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GVqGa.png" alt="enter image description here"  My intention had been to select the code14/code and the following paragraph .. but instead I am presented with the codeWikipedia/code lookup of the symbol code14/code.  Not exactly what were on my mind ..  I have looked through all of the iTerm2 Preferences and not found anything to disable this behavior.  Anyone have better eyes than me on this?
