Source code to string in variable <body> In AppleScript Editor i can see that source_code has script content but row 2 fails for some reason.  precodeset source_code to load script (POSIX file "/path/to/script.scpt") word 2 of source_code /code/pre  This don't work. I try to read AppleScript files to variable.  I don't try to run this loaded code but i need to get it as string.  hr  It seems to fail because source_code is «script» not string. How this can be fixed? Thanks  precodeset source_code to load script (POSIX file "/path/to/script.scpt") word 2 of (source_code as string) --&gt;error "Can’t make «script» into type string." number -1700 from «script» to string word 2 of source_code --&gt;error "Can’t get word 2." number -1728 from word 2 /code/pre  <answer89886> The codeload script/code command loads a script as an object to be run, rather than as text to read or manipulate.  If you want to access the actual text of your script, you can use osadecompile:  precodedo shell script "osadecompile ~/Library/Scripts/test.scpt" word 2 of result /code/pre  Compiled scripts saved with AppleScript Editor usually have LF line endings in strings but CR line endings in other places. osadecompile converts all line endings to LF. codedo shell script/code converts line endings to CR unless you add a codewithout altering line endings/code specifier.  <comment104989> So the first line works (`set source_code ...`) but the second doesn't? What do you expect the second line to do exactly? <comment104997> I expect to see second word in source code. Thanks <comment105646> Cool, this works! Thanks Lauri Ranta. Is there any way to get text which is in Description in bottom of AppleScript Editor window? <comment105655> You could ask another question about it. The description is stored in the resource fork (`cat Untitled.scpt/..namedfork/rsrc` / `xattr -p com.apple.ResourceFork Untitled.scpt | xxd -r -p`) and it is actually rich text, but I don't know how to convert it to rtf or plain text.
