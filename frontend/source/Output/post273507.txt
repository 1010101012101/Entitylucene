MacBook Pro Storage Report is Wrong <body> i have a macbook pro with 128 gb storage. today i ran out of space and looked inside codeAbout this Mac -&gt; Storage/code to see what is taking up the space. turns out i had 15 gb of music files. so i opened the itunes app and removed all of music. then removed every audio file on the system. there is currently no audio file on my system. i checked it with codeDr.Cleaner/code &amp; codeCleanApp/code &amp; codeDiskWave/code but the system report is still showing 4 gb of music data.   the real reason i am posting this question is that codeDiskWave/code says that the Users directory my user name takes up 47 Gb but the sum of all my files in that directory are 25 Gb. how is that possible??? here is the screenshot : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n5rTe.png" alt="screenshot"  am i missing something ?? there are some kind of hidden files or something ?  things i've done : 1- trash is empty. 2- used several other apps. still the same. 3- searched for audio file manually. nothing turns up. 4- used First Aid in Disk Utility. Says the disk is OK.  thanks
