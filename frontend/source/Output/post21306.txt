How can I use iMac internet in my iPod touch? <body> I don't have a Wi-Fi connection here. Is there a way to connect to the internet from my iMac with my iPod touch?  <answer21307> Yes !  You can share you internet connection via Wi-Fi in the "Sharing" preference pane of System preferences. Once activated, your iPod touch will detect a Wi-Fi network that you can join to share the internet connection of your iMac.  (if you're on Lion, replace "Airport" by "Wi-Fi")  ol liOpen System preferences/li liClick on "Sharing"/li liClick on "Internet sharing" (but don't check the checkbox yet)/li liSelect "Ethernet" in the dropdown menu "Share your connection from"/li liCheck "Airport" in the list "via"/li liClick "Airport options" to configure wireless network security/li liCheck the checkbox in front of "Internet sharing" in the list on the left to activate it./li liIf Airport is turned off, it'll ask you if it can turn it on, say yes./li liConnect to the created network with you iPod touch as you would do for any wireless network./li /ol  <comment23320> How does your iMac get its internet connection?
