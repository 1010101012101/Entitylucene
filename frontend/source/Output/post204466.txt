Am I being hacked? <body> I've had several devices wiped because of a very clever/annoying person who won't leave me alone (electronically).    I'm starting to become suspicious of my brand new Macbook Pro 13" purchased from Apple 2 weeks ago, Avast blocks a virus from my Dropbox around 30 times a day, therefore i've removed said application now.    Here is the Console log, can anyone reassure/warn me? Thanks very much.. (apologies for the length of the report, I've removed most dupilcations, it actually goes on for around 250 pages, just from today!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8jAn.png" alt="console screengrab 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HmvAX.png" alt="console screengrab 2"  <answer204470> Short answer...  no.   You're likely just fine.   The error message you are seeing is "common"... you can read more about it on this other post:  Strange message in console about _DirtyJetsamMemoryLimit key  The post describes in detail the error you are seeing and what it means.  <comment246442> Which log entry(ies) make(s) you suspicious? <comment246444> Were these "devices" that were wiped iOS or Android? <comment246447> It's preferable to paste the actual log, rather than screenshots of the log which can't be searched or indexed. <comment246558> I'll try and paste again.... This happened while I was asleep and wifi was turned off. 05/09/2015 22:16:14.000 kernel[0]: IOBluetoothUSBDFU::probe 05/09/2015 22:16:14.000 kernel[0]: IOBluetoothUSBDFU::probe ProductID - 0x8290 FirmwareVersion - 0x0090 05/09/2015 22:16:14.000 kernel[0]: **** [IOBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][start] -- completed -- result = TRUE -- 0x3000 **** 05/09/2015 22:16:14.000 kernel[0]: **** [BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport][start] -- Completed (matched on Device) -- 0x3000 **** 05/09/2015 22:16:14.000 kernel[0]: [IOBluetoothHCIController][staticBluetoo <comment246559> I'm suspicious of the Generating screengrabs of desktop messages and also of the AppleCamIn.                                                                       05/09/2015 22:18:31.818 coreaudiod[297]: 2015-09-05 10:18:31.817899 PM [AirPlay] BTLE client stopping to browse for AirPlay Solo Target Presence. 05/09/2015 22:18:32.000 kernel[0]: AppleCamIn::systemWakeCall - messageType = 0xE0000340 05/09/2015 22:18:32.892 WindowServer[222]: device_generate_desktop_screenshot: authw 0x7fc9e0024bc0(2000), shield 0x7fc9db4744a0(2001) <comment246560> 05/09/2015 22:18:32.908 WindowServer[222]: device_generate_lock_screen_screenshot: authw 0x7fc9e0024bc0(2000)[0, 0, 1280, 800] shield 0x7fc9db4744a0(2001), dev [1280,800] 05/09/2015 22:18:46.825 discoveryd[75]: Basic BTMMServer Sleep offload failed.

Especially as I was asleep while this was happening and my wifi was switched off. <comment246608> @RedEagle2000: A mixture of both Apple, Android and Windows devices! My wallet is seriously light these days... <comment246609> @grgarside: Apologies for the screen grab, I originally tried to copy and paste however it thought I was spamming and because i'm new it would only allow me to attach two pictures...  Thanks everyone!
