Tools to diff two Keynote '09 slideshows <body> Is there any tool which I can use to effectively diff two Keynote '09 slideshows?  strongTL;DR/strong  An Apple Keynote (i.e. a .key) file consists of a directory structure which contains all the resources used in a slideshow (i.e. images, videos) and a code.apxl/code file containing the structure and the text of the slideshow, encoded in a given format. Therefore, it should be possible to diff two versions of the same slideshow comparing the list of resources and the XML file. The comparison should give decent information about what has been changed or added between two versions of the same slideshow.  Is there any tool which is able to do some emclever/em (e.g. strip metadata away from the comparison) emdiffing/em between two Keynote slideshows?  <answer81982> DeltaWalker ($39,95) can compare many files and folders, including Keynote documents. But don't expect it to be an eye-catcher and check on graphic elements...  I compared two Keynote presentations and it looks like the software is only comparing the text.br I had some images in the files, but it doesn't check on that (unfortunately).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s9JEG.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer82108> I ended up writing my own script who does that. It's available at:  https://github.com/robertoaloi/keynote-to-text  Contributions are welcome.  <answer260205> Bit Lasso Reveal is a commercial tool I wrote for finding and comparing slides; works with PowerPoint and Keynote.  <comment108252> dead link... looks like you have a new account. https://github.com/robertoaloi/keynote-to-text <comment108430> Thanks.
