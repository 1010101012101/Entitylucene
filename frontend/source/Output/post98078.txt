Fusion 5, Windows 8 and Boot Camp <body> VMware are not very direct about revealing the features of their producst.  This KB article claims that "VMware Fusion does not support launching a Boot Camp partition with Windows 8 installed on it" while the Fusion 5 homepage says that Fusion 5 supports Windows 8 and that it "lets you run Windows and Mac applications side-by-side directly from your existing Boot Camp partition".  Any idea which is true? Does VMware Fusion 5 support Windows 8 Boot Camp installations or not?  And can it use a Windows 8 BC partition on another disk or only the first disk?  <answer98130> The KB article appears to be outdated. A VMWare staff member advised that "Windows 8 is fully supported as a Boot Camp virtual machine in VMware Fusion 5".  <comment115237> Yeah, I found that one last night too. I wished VMware would list the features of a product on the product's home page and not hidden away in forums.
