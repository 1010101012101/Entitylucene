How to format a MacBook Air 2012? <body> How to format a MacBook Air 2012? This laptop has no installation media.  <answer56407> The MBA comes with a recovery partition already installed. Reboot and keep kbdCmd/kbdkbdR/kbd pressed during boot until the Apple icon is displayed in screen. This boots into Recovery Mode allowing you to repair and/or reinstall the MBA from scratch.  See OS X Lion: About Lion Recovery (HT4718) for details.  <comment64736> Why do you want to format it at all? <comment64738> To get rid of any personal data in it. <comment64739> Additionally, make sure that when you are erasing your drive, add a secure erase by clicking "Security Options" on the Erase tab. <comment64787> Or use FileVault 2 to encrypt the whole disk (something I recommend for laptops anyway)
