iPhone mail using 700Mb with no accounts <body> While trying to clear up space on my iPhone, I deleted all email accounts, as Mail was using well over 700Mb. I was expecting this to also clean up the excessive space being used by Mail, but it hasn't touched it - Mail is still using over 700Mb. I've powered off and back on again several times, and tried re-adding and removing the account multiple times, but Mail still uses loads of space.  Anyone have any ideas how to clean this up?  <answer207965> It seems like I have answered a number of questions with this particular solution, but let's go for it again.  Often times a embackup, wipe, restore/em process will clear out the cruft still sitting around in the rather opaque IOS filesystem. I don't know why but it works:  ol liemBackup:/em Connect the iPhone to your computer and do a manual backup to that computer. Password protect the backup so you don't have to re-enter passwords./li liemWipe:/em Once you have a good backup go into the iPhone  Settings  General  reset  Erase all content and settings. And let it do its thing./li liemRestore:/em Once the phone reboots and is waiting on it's welcome screen plug it back into your computer and restore it from the backup you just made./li /ol  9 times out of 10 all the inexplicable space usage on the phone goes away and you have got your space back.  <comment250546> Very weird. Even with my email account linked, Mail and its data only takes up a meager 3.3 MB. <comment250615> Is it IMAP or POP? Did you empty the Trash? <comment250655> It was a google account. I can't get into the trash because I've deleted the account. Adding the account back shows an empty list until it can download the emails from the server.
