How does access control work on Mac OS X <body> I would like to have user access rules on a central Music folder. In other words, I am the owner and editor and the kids can only copy downs music but certainly not change anything (like my tags). How do I do this?  <answer98514> This set up option will Share your music with others on your local network.  Settings for iTunes sharing  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hP2Nr.png" alt="enter image description here"  If we are talking about standard Folers (not iTunes) but just any folder in Finder.  Right click on the folder  Select      Get info   In that window look all the way at the bottom, there is      small lock   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aAUB4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Open it (with your password)  Now you can modify "others" as they show up in your list the access to this folder to      read only   .  <comment115673> Are you using iTunes? If yes, did you look into Home Sharing already? <comment115724> Thanks, this was however not exactly what I was after. Forget iTunes and Music for a moment and just pretend this question is about simple files. How can I set access control of a full folder and its subfolders such that I have all privileges and my kids can only read (and thus open and copy only)? <comment115725> OK, lets talk about that. Only one question for you: how do your kids access your computer (as different users not administrators), via remote access or how? <comment115744> We are talking about files on a shared network drive. So they would not access my computer. Master files are on my computer and with some little sync software I keep these the same as the network share. However, I do not want them to screw up the network share since that is also used by the music system. <comment115746> The obvious way would be to manage this through accounts on the shared network drive but for some other reasons I do not want to do this. So, ideally, I would Ike to keep using one shared network drive with limited permissions for the kids.
