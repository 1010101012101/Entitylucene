Add Home Folder Hard Drive to Favorites and Desktop <body> I just reinstalled my Mac, thinking I'd give OS X Mountain Lion a try.  In my system, I have both a regular HDD with a partition codeStorage/code and a SSD. On the SSD, I've installed OS X, and now transfered code/Users/kba/code (my home folder) to code/Volumes/Storage/code, so that the codeStorage/code partition now emis/em my home folder. For the most part, this works great.  However, after having done this, OS X now no longer recognizes codeStorage/code as a partition &mdash; it won't allow it to show up on my Desktop next to my SSD codeMacintosh HD/code. It no longer shows under emDevices/em in the Finder sidebar either.  But worst of all, I can't seem to add it to the sidebar! When I go to code/Users/code and drag codekba/code to Favorites, it only stays there for a fraction of a second. Same thing happens if I check codeStorage/code (Home folder) in the Finder Preferences: codeStorage/code blinks, then disappears from the sidebar and takes the ✔ in the checkbox along as it goes.  h3emmount/em output/h3  precode/dev/disk0s1 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s2 on /Volumes/Storage (hfs, local, journaled) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /code/pre  h3emls -h@lde /Volumes/Storage/em output/h3  precodedrwxrwxr-x@ 32 kba  staff   1,1K 30 Jul 20:26 /Volumes/Storage com.apple.FinderInfo      32B  /code/pre  <answer59101> strongI've solved it myself./strong I just tried to drag codeStorage/code into Favorites now and it works for some reason!  I'm thinking that it's because I (a few days ago) wrote found a command that was meant to remove codenobrowse/code. (I don't recall exactly where I found it or exactly what it was, so I can't paste it here. Sorry).  After running the command, codeStorage/code suddenly appeared on my Desktop, even though (as it can also be see in the question) OS X didn't mention anything about the drive having the flag codenobrowse/code. Either way, after codeStorage/code appeared on the Desktop, I still couldn't make it show up under Favorites. Until now. I hadn't tried to reboot earlier, so that might be why it suddenly works.  Thanks to everyone trying to help in the comments above.  <comment67226> How is "Storage" mounted ? Sounds like it might be mounted with the "nobrowse" option. Could you add the output of the "mount" command to your question ? <comment67262> No problem here with sidebar presentation of my Core Storage encrypted ZFS home on 10.8. <comment67385> @Tyr, I don't know what _nobrowse_ is, but I can easily browse the hard drive by clicking _Music_ (e.g.) in the sidebar and then choose _Storage_ in the Path Bar. Also, I've added `mount` output. <comment67386> @GrahamPerrin Is your disk the `/Users` folder or just your private home folder (`/Users/graham`)? Does the disk show up in _Devices_ in the sidebar? <comment67416> Home for me (gjp22) is `/Volumes/gjp22` and yes, it's a device in the sidebar. If you log in as a different user, can that user see your `Storage` as a device in the sidebar? Please add to the question the result of ls `-h@lde /Volumes/Storage` <comment67418> I don't have other users, but prior to changing my home directory to `/Volumes/Storage`, I had no trouble seeing _Storage_ in the sidebar. <comment67429> Is your homedir set to /Volumes/Storage directly or did you put a link in /Users/kba pointing there ? <comment67441> @Tyr I set my homedir from _System Preferences - Users & Groups - kba - Advanced Options_. This automatically creates a symlink: _`/Users/kba` - `/Volumes/Storage/`_. <comment67471> That link isn't automatically created afaik. I'm with Graham, create a second user that way you can test an umount/mount via Disk Utility and see what happens. You need a second user anyway be able to login to your machine in case the Storage disk fails. <comment67472> Yes, the link is in fact created automatically. I'll create a new test account now, then. <comment67473> Yes, the link is in fact created automatically. Storage does not show up in Devices when logged in to another account, but I can, however, still access it through Terminal. I suspect it's because it's owned by `kba`, but I don't know. <comment68149> I'm glad the issue is worked around. If it recurs:  somewhere in one of the stacks, I recall a question or answer about the `.plist` that is, or was, used for sidebar stuff (keywords: *Network* and *Shared*). From what you describe, it's possible that the preference file was corrupt … maybe an edge case involving an upgrade or migration from Lion.
