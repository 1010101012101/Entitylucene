Is it possible to hide title bar of Firefox 22 in OS X 10.8.4 <body> Is there any way to hide or remove Firefox 22 title bar in OS X 10.8.4?  <answer96952> Short answer: no  It has been a bug since firefox 13 Even though autohide is set to 'true' the toolbars won't hide in fullscreen.  Best option is to go to view - Toolbars and uncheck the toolbars in the top menu But this leaves the 'tab toolbar'  So if you really want to hide the toolbars you should open the page in a different browser.  <answer117459> No, not in FF 22, that feature will be introduced in Firefox 28.
