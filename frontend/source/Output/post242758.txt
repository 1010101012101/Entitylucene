Bought a stolen iPhone - how to find the owner? <body> Weird and long story short: I am travelling around South America at the moment and am in Bolivia right now. Yesterday a taxi driver suddenly offered me a well working iPhone 6, with the front screen a bit broken, for a ridiculously low price (35$). I didn't want to take it at first -- his story was that a druken English tourist dropped it in his cab a day earlier. He saw me hesitate and brought his price down to 25$. At that moment I figured I might as well buy it and try to find the owner again, to give it back.  Couple of things: the iPhone is SIM locked (no idea with which carrier), and presumably Activation Locked too.  imei.info says that Find My Iphone is activated: any idea how I could find the persons email adress? Or any other way to get their contact info? All I have is the IMEI number.  Thanks!  <comment298707> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/26710/how-can-i-find-the-owner-of-an-obstinate-iphone?rq=1 <comment298708> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/901/how-can-i-contact-the-owner-of-a-lost-iphone-who-has-a-password-lock?rq=1
