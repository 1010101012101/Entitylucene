What is "All..." that just appeared in my Finder sidebar? <body> This "Network Neighborhood" icon recently appeared on my Finder's sidebar, pointing to some items I haven't seen before, all of them empty.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A1Th0.png" alt="screenshot of Finder"  ul liProcyon is an Apple Time Capsule./li liSkype is running but why are there two links?/li li'messenger.live.com' doesn't make much sense; I don't use messenger and it doesn't appear in Activity Monitor or in codeps -A/code./li /ul  What would cause the sidebar link to appear in the first place?  MacOS 10.6.8 The most recent Software Update was iTunes to v11.2.1, applied two days ago. I noticed this change in approximately that time-frame - but, iTunes?!  <comment154716> This isn't the normal Finder. PathFinder, TotalFinderâ€¦? <comment154724> Indeed - it's TotalFinder running over Finder. <comment154725> Weird!! I relaunched plain Finder and the sidebar item was gone. I launched TotalFinder again, and it remains gone!
