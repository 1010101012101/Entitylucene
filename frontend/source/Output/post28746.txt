Favicons not showing in Safari 5.1.1 on OSX Lion? <body> Since upgrading to Safari 5.1.1 none of the websites I am visiting is displaying Favicons. I had a look in code~/Library/Safari/Icons/code to try and reset these but noticed that the file/folder doesn't exist, so the problem is not related to the caching.  This was working fine in a clean install of Lion before upgrading to 10.7.2. Even installing Glims and setting the icons to display in the tab headers did not fix the problem.  Is anyone aware of a fix for this, or whether this is a known bug?  <answer28749> After doing some research it turns out I am not the only one with this problem, and Safari has changed the location for it's favicon database.   From this Apple Forum discussion:     ul   liQuit Safari. /li   liGo to ~/Library/Safari.    Move the WebpageIcons.db file from the Safari folder to the Trash./li   liRelaunch Safari./li   /ul   <comment33055> I'm running Safari 5.1.1 on Lion (10.7.2) and see the favicons. <comment33056> And, to be sure, I did a Safari - Reset Safari, and removed Website icons, then refreshed the page. I see the favicon again. <comment33057> And that directory doesn't exist for me either, but I still see the icons. <comment33058> @Alex WIll give it a try now, I think I may need to do a repair permissions again :( I seem to have to do that often lately. <comment44974> The key here is the Relauch, just emptying cache and refreshing does nothing. <comment67839> Followed directions above--problem is that when I relaunched Safari the Webpagelcons.db file was recreated and the favicons still don't appear! LG <comment67840> Forgot to mention that I upgraded to OS10 10.7.4 (using Safari 6.0)--could this explain the missing favicon problem?? <comment76671> just tried this, Safari 6.0, OS 10.7.4. The site I'm checking is using a PNG for its favicon, but other sites using .ico files work ok. Haven't tested more than a couple yet, but worth considering
