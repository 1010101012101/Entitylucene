Restore data in iPhone <body> I accidentally went into my phone and deleted my phone from Find My iPhone, I was surprised to see that all my photos and contacts and app were deleted, I want to restore my old data back, how can I do that?  <answer219007> You can do it from a previous backup saved in your computer (where is located iTunes) or from an iCloud backup.  Both the procedures can be done if and only if you previously completed a backup.  strongRestore from an iCloud backup/strong  ol liOn your iOS device, go to Settings  General  Software Update.

How exactly did you remove your phone from "find my iPhone"? <comment264921> I read it as "remote deleted" it, as opposed to removed it. Didn't know you could do it from the device you're on right now. <comment264957> @patrix I think Rodaina erase the iPhone form the tool available on Find My iPhone.
