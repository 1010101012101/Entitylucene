Is there a way to default ALL new reminders/calendar events to have an alert? <body> I like my iPhone, but one thing that REALLY bugs me is that EVERY time I create an event I have to manually set an alert.    (One has to wonder why Apple thinks that I would add an entry into my calendar and NOT want an alert.  At the very least this should be configurable - to do some default.)  strongI am hoping there is such a setting that I have overlooked.  Is there?/strong  <answer50105> Yes, there's a setting!
