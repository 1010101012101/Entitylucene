How to Change Hyperlink Color in macOS Notes <body> The hyperlinks in Notes on macOS are essentially yellow on white, as shown in the screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YK9A.png" alt="Default Hyperlink Color in macOS Notes"  I would like to change the color to any darker color to improve the contrast, but how? I have tried to highlight hyperlinks to change their color, but the color remains the same even after selecting a color for them.  <answer269845> As someone who's done a lot of UX (user experience) work over the years, I have to admit I was very surprised when I first saw the hyperlink colour in Apple's Notes app. Not so surprised that someone would actually propose it, but very surprised it passed through all the review processes at Apple.  Anyway, I do have a couple of workaround options that emmay/em help you until Apple addresses this, as I fully expect they will at some point. These options are far from perfect, but if the default hyperlink colour is enough of an issue, they are worth considering.  strongHyperlinks displaying the actual URL/strong  If your hyperlink text displays the actual URL (e.g. "apple.stackexchange.com" instead of "Ask Different") you can do this:  ol liRight-click on the yellow link/li liFrom the context menu, select emRemove Link/em/li /ol  You will notice that the link text now changes to black* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double-click) and then right-clicking to select the emOpen URL/em option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.  *If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with emhttp:/em etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link.   strongHyperlinks displaying words/strong  If your hyperlink text displays words instead of an actual URL (e.g. "Ask Different" instead of "apple.stackexchange.com") you can do this:  ol liRight-click on the yellow link/li liFrom the context menu, select emEdit Link.../em/li liThis will open up the Link Destination window with the full URL already selected. Copy (kbdcommand/kbdkbdC/kbd) or cut (kbdcommand/kbdkbdX/kbd) the link and click on the OK button./li liIn your note, Paste (kbdcommand/kbdkbdV/kbd) the URL over the original hyperlink text/li liRight-click on what is still a yellow link/li liFrom the context menu, select emRemove Link/em/li /ol  Once again you will notice that the link text now changes to black* and the actual link no longer activates by just clicking on it. However, you can still use it as a hyperlink by selecting it (just double-click) and then right-clicking to select the emOpen URL/em option from the context menu. If you prefer, you can also change the text colour to something you prefer.  *If the URL is a full URL (i.e. it starts with emhttp:/em etc), then you will need to manually change the text colour from the default yellow after removing the link.   <comment338994> I'd try the solution presented in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205575/how-to-change-the-default-font-and-size-in-notes-on-el-capitan <comment338996> @Volsk Thank you, but that question is about font size, not hyperlink color.  I followed all references but did not find references to hyperlink color in any configuration file. Was I supposed to infer more that I have from the answers and comments? <comment339043> There is a section about hyperlinks in pad.css. It looks lik this: a {     color: rgb(158, 75, 47);     text-decoration: underline; } <comment339078> Oh, gosh - I missed that somehow. After disabling SIP in order to change the value (to `rgb(0, 64, 128)`), Notes still displays the yellow hyperlink. <comment339081> Sorry. Was worth a try <comment339938> Thank you. I knew these things, but I very much appreciate your answer. I will have to wait for Apple to include the feature.
