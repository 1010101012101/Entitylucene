Will a new keychain be synchronized over iCloud? <body> If I create a new personal Keychain, in this example I called "Test", everything I save into my new "Test" goes to my iCloud too? Or remain just local into my computer?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MDKAt.png" alt=""  <answer136242> This keychain will remain local. Only keys/certs/etc in the iCloud Keychain will be synchronised over iCloud.
