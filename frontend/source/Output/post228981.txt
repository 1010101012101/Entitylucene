How do I remove everything Parallels? <body> Background: Mac Pro 4.1 circa 2009, specs:  ul liOS X El Capitan Version 10.11.3 (just updated last weekend) /li liSN - H09440CK20H /li li2 - 2.93 GHz Quad-core Intel Xenon processors /li li32 GB RAM/li li2 - 1 TB HD/li li1 - MacPro Raid Card/li /ul  The last user of the machine had Parallels 3 running on it and it may be messing up the machine.  I don't need or want Parallels and want to completely remove it and its partition.  It looks like someone has tried to remove Parallels in the past, reset the partition size, and deleted some files - kind of messy.  I ran Disk Utility - First Aid to see what it showed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E3a9K.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can see that Parallels has some problems.  Commenters have noted the images look too small, but I think the main take-away is that First Aid on the Parallels volume fails.  Additionally, the following screen shot shows what remains in the Parallels partition:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bs3Kw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Which just shows an empty Backup folder and some inaccessible virtual machines from the time of Snow Leopard.  How can I get rid of codeParallels/code, its partition, and everything previously associated with it (hopefully, short of a complete wipe of the machine, but I'll do that if necessary)?  hr  Additional things I've tried...  I've tried to use codeDisk Utility/code to codeErase/code the codeParallels/code volume.  Doing so gives me an error:     Unmounting disk      Couldn't unmount disk.      Operation failed...   Doing the same thing at the codeAPPLE RAID Card Media/code that has codeParallels/code under it gives me the same error.  Clicking the codeUnmount/code button in codeDisk Utility/code doesn't seem to do anything, no message at all.  Right clicking on the codeParallels/code "disk" that shows on my desktop and selecting codeEject "Parallels/code produces the following error message:     "The disk "Parallels wasn't ejected because one or more programs may   be using it.      You can try to eject the disk again or click Force Eject to eject it   immediately.   I have not tried to codeForce Eject/code the codeParallels/code "disk" that shows on my desktop, yet.

There are additional Parallels KB Articles of other versions too. <comment279279> @user3439894 -- Unfortunately, nothing the the Parallels installation works anymore and I don't have access to the original installation disks.   I found some new info that I'll append to the question. <comment279308> Thanks for all of this.  I think I've done it.  This does lead me to another question to follow. <comment279311> @Jagra I hope I can answer it ;-)
