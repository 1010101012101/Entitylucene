3TB Airport Time Capsule (FW 7.7.3) Incorrect DNS address delivered by DHCP <body> 3TB Airport Time Capsule (FW 7.7.3) DHCP sends the correct DNS address to hosts for the Primary network, but sends the Gateway address for the Guest network.  If I correct the DNS manually on a host, Internet works fine.  What's the problem?  Any LAN Host: DNS 172.16.42.1 Should be 8.8.8.8  <answer157849> I got this hint from https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2735366?start=0&amp;tstart=0  Check out the last post from Paul Verity.     I've just hit on this problem too, and also found that deleting the   DNS entries in my TimeCapsules DNS configuration fixed the problem.   <comment185746> Interesting... I'll give it a try.  My current TC 1st DNS entry is my Windows Server AD DNS for my private domain and the 2nd is Googles 8.8.8.8.  When I go back to look at the TC settings its applied an IPv6 entry as well?? <comment185755> https://discussions.apple.com/message/27159746
