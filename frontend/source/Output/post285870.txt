How to access icloud.com on Chrome for Android? <body> Apple refuses to load icloud.com on Chrome for Android.  Instead of showing the login form, the page displays a message stating that "Your browser is not supported".  How can I bypass this restriction?  <answer285881> This restriction can be bypassed by changing your browser's user agent.  This can be done by clicking the "..." menu and selecting "Request desktop site".  Apparently Apple only blocks Chrome for Android, not for desktop.

This seems quite OK to have on the site - I even voted up the answer / question. It might be duplicate of another question - but it's clearly on topic as edited (thanks Tom) <comment360684> It's probably a safe bet to assume the initial down-votes were due to the rant towards Apple in the original unedited post.
