Is it possible to make Finder order on modified at, recursively? <body> If I visit code~/code/code in Finder and order on codemodified at/code it does not recursively order. That is, if I have a file X in it which was modified yesterday and a folder with a file Y in it that was modified today, file X would be ordered before the folder with Y in it. Can it be achieved?  If that is not possible, is there a script that is triggered each time a file is saved which touches the parent folder to get same result?  <answer263066> Solved it by creating a script which watches for file writes and touches the written file's parent to update its modified timestamp.   fswatch is needed too watch for writes.  Install through homebrew with codebrew install fswatch/code.
