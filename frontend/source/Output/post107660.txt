How to disable “Fast Start” in Safari? <body> In Mavericks’ Safari, the “feature” named “Fast Start” begins to load the first result of the search typed in the search bar.  How can I disable such folly ?  <answer107661> ol liGo to Safari → Preferences (or hit kbd⌘ cmd/kbd+kbd,/kbd)./li liGo to emPrivacy/em and click on the strongDo not preload Top Hit in the background/strong option.                    /li /ol  <comment126248> I have received a message about an answer : “There is no such option in Safari even in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari.plist/.” But I see no such answer here. In fact, I prefer @Matthieu’s answer. <comment126249> Nice ! :-) Happily Apple has placed a switch.
