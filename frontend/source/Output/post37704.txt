iBooks preview not working? <body> I recently converted one of my books into an iBooks format using Author. However when I connected to my iPad and went into 'preview', I saw my device, clicked it, but the 'preview' button to enable the previewing process was faded and I could not click it. Has anyone actually used the preview feature enough to give me some help? Thanks!  <answer37740> Had the same issue with my iMac running Lion and iPad 1. The iPad was visible but greyed out, as was the preview button.  Here's what worked for me:   ul liConnect iPad to Mac/li liOpen iBooks on iPad/li liClick on preview in Author/li liClose iBooks on iPad/li liCancel preview and tap on preview again/li liOpen iBooks on iPad again/li /ul  Not sure why or how, but it worked for me.  Good luck!  <answer250006> I had the same problem.  Then I realized that I had "Hide my iCloud books" enabled.  Once I disabled that feature, I was able to see my unpublished iBook.  <answer262435> The key to making the iPad available in the preview selection box of iBooks Author was quitting iBooks Author, and restarting.  Now I can preview the latest version of my book on iPad Pro.  <comment42866> Hey, really big thanks for the help. However after further study I realized I installed iBooks 2 on my iPhone but forgot on iPad. I tried just about all I could and finally solved the trouble. However for your troubles I will make your answer my accepted answer. Again, thanks! <comment43471> How do you cancel a preview? I don't see this option. <comment328815> Did you restart the iPad?
