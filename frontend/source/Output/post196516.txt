iOS - set a specific wifi connection as a portable hotspot <body> If I use a portable hotspot or share Wi-Fi through another mobile device, is there a way to set that Wi-Fi connection as a data connection so that it won't try to upload stuff it only does on Wi-Fi like photos and updating apps and so on?  I ask because my other device with Android has this option and it has been life saving a couple of times.  <comment234767> It would be nice, but sadly apple doesn't seem to understand that people do have to use metered WiFi sometimes.  I had an iOS update download burn up an entire data allocation.... <comment339674> It appears this feature is still missing from iOS :( -- Feel free to submit a feature request at http://www.apple.com/feedback
