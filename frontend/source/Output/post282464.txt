Macbook pro keyboard and trackpad stopped working for weeks <body> My macbook pro's keyboard and trackpad stopped working for many weeks. br I thought it was cable misconnection but the cable was in there fine. br I've been using external keyboard and mouse for the whole time and it really sucks. br Anyone know the problem and/or the solution to this? And no, my warranty is over. br (version: early 2015)  <comment355822> Have you tried booting in Safe Mode (hold Shift key while booting) or have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257)?  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.
