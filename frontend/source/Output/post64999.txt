What is the best way to create a slideshow in iphoto across multiple events? <body> I want to put together a slideshow but i want to use pictures across multiple events.  I see you can click on Slideshow on a particular event.  Do I have to copy these picture all into a new "event" just to do a slideshow on it ?  <answer65027> Even easier: Make an Album of the photos you want to use in the Slideshow, and base it on that. This has a couple of advantages:  ol liIt simply references the photos in the Events, and uses no ezra disk space, while keeping your Events intact/li liYou can sort the photos manually, into any order you like, which you can't do with Events./li /ol  To make a new Album: select a couple of the pics and go Command-n; then drag the rest of the photos to that  Or, shift-command-n to make a new empty album  <answer86889> To add to the previous post, once you've created your album and it shows in your source list on the left-hand side, you would then select the album for which you want to create the slideshow and click on the Create button.
