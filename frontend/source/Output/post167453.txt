Screen Sharing without Username and Password login <body> When I connect to a Mac with Screen Sharing enabled, I get a screen which asks for the Mac's username and password which I need to type in before I can see the actual desktop.  Is there any way to stop this so I do not need to login?  Thanks  <answer167719> If you have identical accounts with the same credentials set up on both Macs, and you are currently logged in as that account, I do not believe that it will prompt you at all when you connect to the other Mac.  <comment196316> Wouldn't really be secure, would it, if you could just share into any machine you liked?
