The different signatures for different email accounts system doesn't work <body> I have 5 different email accounts that I use on my iPhone (iPhone 5, iOS 10.3). I have set everything correctly in the settings regarding signatures, so I should have different default signatures set for each email account, but instead it is always the same one. Why does this email feature not work in my iPhone? / How can I make this work?
