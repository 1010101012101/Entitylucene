Multi-column application list on uBar <body> Is there any way to configure uBar so that the application list spans on several columns (instead of having to scroll as we need to by default)?  One column = need to scroll:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Stuqv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Several columns = no need to scroll:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QN61O.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment247810> I haven't found any solution so far. <comment247811> So I am still interested if someone has any idea.
