AppleScript editor to connect and disconnect again to specific server <body> I's trying to write an AppleScript to disconnect and connect again to specific server:  precode    tell application "Finder"         mount volume "smb://serveraddress/sharename" as user name "username" with password "password"     end tell /code/pre  But it is connecting only. I'm trying to do both: to disconnect and then to connect again.  <answer217840> I finaly figered out how to do that so i write this code and it works  precodetell application "Finder"     try         eject alias "Volume name"     end try     mount volume "afp://Server/volume"         open alias "Volume name" end tell /code/pre  I hope it will be helpful.  <comment263337> Can you add the code you are using for the disconnect part as well?
