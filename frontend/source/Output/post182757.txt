What is the difference between open (-a) <app> and double click in finder/spotlight? <body> I recently installed leksah on my Mac (once directly, once via brew cask).  When I try to open it in Finder, Dock or use spotlight the window flashes open for a second and then closes immediately.  When I open it via terminal using codeopen -a Leksah/code or codeopen ~/Applications/Leksah/code it opens just fine.  <answer182758> Well, one difference is that via Command Line, you can pass the file to be opened as an argument, but I guess this is not the difference you are after.  The behaviour you speak of appears to be a bug which can be observed when running Yosemite. The issue is still open: https://github.com/leksah/leksah/issues/37
