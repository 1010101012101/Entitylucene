"Import from Scanner" greyed out in Preview app <body> I have a Canon Pixma MG6300 printer/scanner for which I properly installed the drivers.

This menu item, however, is greyed out.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djdE9.png" alt="Preview Import from Scanner greyed out"  Does anyone know how I can have my scanner show up in here?

Click Macintosh HD in the left panel and then click Repair Disc Permissions in the right panel.  If that isn't sufficient, then go through all the steps that Chunghao gave.  <answer238727> Turned out my problem was that the scanner wasn't connected. Plugging in the USB helped a lot.
