iPod nano 7th generation does not pair with any Bluetooth device <body> My iPod nano 7th generation is giving a lot of trouble in pairing with other Bluetooth devices (headphones, car audio, speaker). I cannot even pair it with my iPhone. I turn on the Bluetooth option and just keep going and going looking for devices, I put them close together and nothing.  Any solution?  <answer244774> Have you tried pairing it with other bluetooth devices? If not, I suggest you do so. If all else fails, then it's probably a hardware issue and you must ask for help from Apple.
