I haven't checked out the details but my understanding is that the Bluetooth profile is much better in the iPhone 4 and iPad than in the early iPhones. I expect you could also hook up to BT headphones and speakers to stream music.  <answer2064> In addition to P2P sharing and audio streaming like Doug said, if you have a jailbroken 3G one, you can create a wifi hotspot using MiFi.  <answer2065> Also, some emulators allow you to use a Wii controller via Bluetooth.  <answer51833> There are Bluetooth-to-IR devices (for example) that let you control your TV and other devices from your iPad over Bluetooth.  <comment59314> thanks for the answer.
