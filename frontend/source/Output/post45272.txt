Connection to server fails after waking from sleep <body> I connect to my Windows computer with my MBP using codeConnect to Server/code (using smb://192.x.x.x).  For a reason I can't explain, it works well when I do it but if I close my laptop (meaning closing the screen, not turning power off) and reopen it, almost 90% of the time, I won't be able to access the remote computer.  The only way to solve the problem and be able to reconnect is to reboot the macbook.  I use Snow Leopard.  Does anyone know a fix for this ?  strongUpdate:/strong I forgot to say I see I'm still connected but I can't 'eject' the mount.  I just does nothing.  <answer45273> Sometimes a network device may stay "connected" even though the connection isn't working properly. Try manually ejecting it from the Finder sidebar, if it appears there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9QwAy.png" alt=""  Then try connecting again with kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdK/kbd.  If that doesn't work, this question on Super User suggests some more possible solutions.  <answer45345> From the Terminal  codemount | grep smb | awk {'print$3'} | xargs -t umount -f/code  This will forcibly unmount all smb mounted shares.  <comment51562> Is the key combination the samething as clicking on 'eject' ? I updated my question to say the eject was not working.  Thanks for the other link, I'll try it. <comment51565> Do you see any output in Console, perchance? <comment51566> I don't get what you mean with your question.  Sorry. <comment51568> Open Console from /Applications/Utilities, and see if anything looks relevant. <comment51570> Oh, now I get it. I'll try to replicate the problem again and see if I can find something there.  Thank you.
