App for Blocking Website in Safari (For Productivity Purposes) <body> Are there any apps on OS X that can block certain websites ('time-wasting ones') for a certain interval?  Preferably works for Safari.  <answer118208> SelfControl is a free app that will let you enter the websites you want blocked and for how long you want them blocked for.  <answer154104> I downloades SelfControl, and while it seems the only option for Safari users, it is a very limited program. You can only block up to 1 day. Unlike programs like stayfocusd, and cold turkey, which allow you to properly schedule blocking times, I might advise you to just switch to using chrome again, there seem to be more well developed programs for that, unfortunately  <answer179620> WasteNoTime is a good app for this. It is a browser extension.  <answer225358> Blocker for Facebook is available for Safari: https://extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.devankuleindiren.blockerforfacebook-ZRQ35C78DB  It creates a button that, upon clicking, asks you for how many minutes you'd like to block Facebook. If you go to Facebook, it throws a popup stating Facebook is blocked and redirects you to Google.  <answer250193> I'm currently trying Mindful Browsing and I really like it. It's very simple to setup and does the job perfectly.  Check out the website: http://www.mindfulbrowsing.com.
