Is this error message a serious problem or can it be ignored (Unetbootin, Gparted, USB, menu.c32)? <body> I try to build a bootable USB with Gparted on it with the use of Unetbootin.  I downloaded the 32bit Gparted .iso from http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gparted/gparted-live-0.27.0-1-i686.iso.   It is linked here, the first one under stable releases.  When Unetbootin performs the installation on the USB stick the following error occurs.  It says that codefile menu.c32 already exists/code and lets me decide if I want it to be overridden.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fgLn.png" alt="Unetbootin"  Is this normal?  <comment341543> Which ISO Image, exactly, are you using? The Debian based GParted Live ISO Images can be written directly to USB using `dd`.
