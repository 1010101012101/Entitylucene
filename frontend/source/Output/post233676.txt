Light-weight system monitor tool/app for OSX, Conky alternatives <body> On common UNIX-like computer operating systems there was extremely flexible/customizeable/lightweight tool for emSystem Stats monitoring/em, called codeConky/code. I'd like to find alternative system monitoring tool for operating system stats in strongOS X/strong, preferable with the same set of features or more, e.g.:  ul liemOS stats monitoring/em (CPU usage, mem usage, network monitoring, disk usage, "top" like process stats, uname, uptime, etc);/li lisupport of emcompact representation in system tray (menu bar)/em, or/end desktop-widget view;/li lilightweight;/li lihighly customizable, support of emuser configuration/em (alike in codeconky/code-app: display information either as text, or using simple progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours);/li /ul  strongWhat options for application/tools exist for OS X?/strong  I searched for the other topics, and found, that answers/questions are not well organized, some of them are really specialized, lots of duplicates, etc. Let's be more specific.  h2Rules to structure the answer/h2  ol liOne app per answer./li liUse strongthis format for the first two lines/strong of your answer:     ## code[app name](link to website)/code      ### code[App Store](link to AppStore) (price)/code /li liCheck for duplicates before adding new answers./li liIf you find a duplicate, vote it down and encourage its poster to up-vote the original entry instead (and remove the duplicate)./li liInclude short description (preferably not marketing text) about what this strongsystem monitor/strong does:  ul liwhich OS stats (uname, uptime, CPU usage, mem usage, disk usage, "top" like process stats, and network monitoring, just to name a few);/li liwhat are configuration options, how flexible they are;/li lican it be shown nicely/compact in system tray (menu bar);/li lican it display information either as text, or using simple progress bars and graph widgets, with different fonts and colours;/li liprovide one-two screenshots, if possible (with permanent link)/li liunique features;/li liis it lightweight or monstrous;/li lietc.  /li /ul/li /ol  <answer233678> h2MenuMeters/h2  h3Official website (FREE), open-source/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILKar.png" alt="system tray"  strongFeatures:/strong  ul liCPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring tools for Mac OS X;/li liare a true emSystemUIServer/em plugins (also known as Menu Extras);/li liNet Meter can display network throughput as arrows, bytes per second, and/or as a graph. /li liminimalism: extremely lightweight and dumb simple;/li lisize is ~1Mb;/li liopen-source, freeware./li /ul  Official website states about exception:     MenuMeters cannot be used on 10.11 El Capitan   But I managed to run on strongOS X El Capitan (10.11.3)/strong without any problems, I will provide the link on re-compiled version, as this tool is opensource. It works like a charm for a last year, not a single issue found even after automatic system updates.

The app uses about 100-150 MB of RAM at any one time, and has minimal impact on the CPU.  <answer233725> h2BitBar/h2  h3Official site (free, open source)/h3     The BitBar app lets you put the output from any script or program right in your Mac OS X menu bar. And it's completely free. An impressive number of plugins have already been contributed by a wide range of developers just like you, and this site makes it easy to find them.   The website does indeed list a large number of network and system plugins for monitoring CPU usage, uptime, battery status,etc., and of course you can write your own; they're just shell scripts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3y2ef.png" alt="Uptime plugin by Matteo Ferrando"  <comment285575> can the screenshots be reduced in size, or is it possible somehow to shrink the answer and to make it laconic and easy to read? or even to reduce/align the number of screenshots. thank you. <comment285576> I'm trying to do that right now, actually. They're quite annoying having to scroll so much. Sorry about that <comment285580> Okay, so it seems I can't find a way. I'm going to take this matter to meta <comment285588> @perhapsmaybeharry see the answer to http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2738/how-can-we-reduce-the-size-of-a-image-while-editing <comment285589> Yep, got it from there. I hope it looks better now <comment285591> How this app can use *50Mb*, if the packed DMG is around the same size? Lots of controls, widgets, graphs, etc... When I tried this, I think it was closer to ~**300Mb** in the memory, constantly, I think it's way too much for being lightweight, for what is does. <comment285592> `htop` reports current app RAM usage to be 102MB. Make sure the main "customisation" window isn't open, that takes some RAM as well. <comment285611> OMG, this one is really feature rich beast, tons of different plugins, widgets, utilities!  I definitely would try. <comment291202> @bmike, it's not really a duplicate, as you indicated, the ticket you are referencing is just the small part of current question. The question is much wider and not limited to the taskbar. I'd mark those question as related, but not duplicate. Or if you want to "merge" them, that it sounds to me the other ticket is a subset of current ticket, not vise-versa. Please, re-consider and review them one more time. Thank you. <comment291214> I'm willing to reverse my vote if there is some consensus on [meta] or an edit to make is clearer how this is different than the other list of tools. We might need a side discussion on _list of X_ questions as they have other issues that generally get them closed or down voted into oblivion. I've removed the wiki since we generally don't use that anymore. <comment291222> @bmike, I changed the subject, so the sense is encapsulated within it, and it would be better for SEO. Voted for reopening. And thank you for the input regarding *wiki*, this concept is confusing for sure, I bet most of people don't understand it, and there are no clear criteria and flow for this type of question.
