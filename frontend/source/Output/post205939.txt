Copying a backup disk <body> I have 2 NAS drives. I want to copy all content from my old NAS to the new. There is about 800GB of data. First I tried using Finder to do the copy and received this error:     The Finder can't complete the operation because some data in   "a_folder" can't be read or written. (Error code -36)   Then on the advice of this thread I used rsync. I mounted both network volumes and dragged each in to terminal for the source and destination and ended up with this command :  precodesudo rsync -vaE --progress /Volumes/Archive /Volumes/RAIDArchive /code/pre  After about 1 hour, directly after "building file list ..." I receive a bunch of errors of 3 types. About 100 of these:     rsync readdir("/Volumes/Archive/somefolder"): Permission denied (13)   1 of these:     rsync: recv_generator:mkdir "Volumes/RAIDArchive" failed: Input/output   eroor (5)   And strongemlots/em/strong of these (I guess as many as there are folders):     rsync: recv_generator:mkdir "/volumes/RAIDArchive/somefolder" failed:   No such file or directory (2)   I'd be very grateful for any advice on how to proceed.  <comment248313> I would in this case ssh into one NAS and use rsync from it directly to the other NAS <comment248319> Thanks Mark. Actually I just found it is possible to use the NAS software to run a backup directly to the other NAS. I'm following instructions from here: http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/nas/nas-howto/30885-how-to-back-up-nas-to-nas-part-4 Fingers crossed :) <comment248327> No luck with the NAS software. The backup failed. Looking at the log file it is also using rsync and is also creating a bunch of errors.
