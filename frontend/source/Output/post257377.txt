How can I watch a video sent through iMessage in fullscreen? <body> I have received a video (I think it might be a gif) in iMessage on my iPhone 7 and I can watch it there, but it is so small. I would like to make the video full screen. Is there a way to do this? Single touching it, hard touching it, long touching it...none of these seem to work.
