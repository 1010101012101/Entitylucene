How do I open old Notes saved on my external hard drive? <body> I've located the files in:  ~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.notes/  but now I am unsure how to actually open them and view the content. "Open With" Notes app does not seem to work  <answer265379> You could use an app like https://www.sqlitepro.com/ to open the SQLlite database. But are you sure your data is there? At my system there is nothing in it.  <comment332702> Notes don't work like that. They are stored in special files that need to be in specific locations.
