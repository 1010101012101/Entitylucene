Best version of OSX for 2008 iMac? <body> (This is a follow-up to How to improve old, slow iMac -- new SSD? Or more RAM?)  I replace the HD on our old 2008 iMac 8,1 with an SSD, and it seems much faster. However, it WAS running 10.9; now it's on 10.7.4 (which was already on the SSD.)  Should I install 10.9 like the App Store suggests? Or keep the 10.7.4?  It only has 3GB of RAM.  <answer127538> I am of the opinion that you should keep your O/S up to date unless you have a SPECIFIC reason to stay at an earlier version. E.G. incompatible software that you MUST run or a noted incompatibility with a service that you can't do without (EG some people are still having issues with MS Exchange compatibility in mail.app on Mavericks).  So, your computer has enough RAM (more RAM if possible) and a nice fast SSD so I would go with the Mavericks install... IMHO  <answer186063> I have a 2008 iMac 8,1 Core 2 Duo running OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite. Yosemite actually consumes less HDD space and appears to run faster than older versions of OS X.  My recommendation is always upgrade to the latest OS.  Note also about two years ago replaced original 1+1GB RAM... now have (2+4) 6 GB 800 MHz DDR2 SDRAM. Works beautifully.  <answer186500> I do have the same iMac as you.   I believe Snow Leopard is the fastest system you can install in your iMac though its not supported by Apple anymore.   I did the upgrade to 10.9 and I felt the system slower, but, I did that because some softwares required the upgrade to run.   When Yosemite came your, I gave it a try. I made a fresh install and, at beginning everything appeared to be normal. But I felt the system VERY slow at everyday life tasks. So I decided to downgrade back to Mavericks.   <answer186509> Anything below 10.10 the newest system has so much disk I/O it could fry the older hard drive.
