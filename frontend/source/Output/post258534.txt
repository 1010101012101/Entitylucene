Sierra Finder Icon ordering/insertion failing <body> Since I updated to strongSierra/strong I have the following issue both on my Macbook and iMac (btw. the new 10.12.1 update didn't fix this either). Whenever a new file is created inside a folder (that doesn't have auto-sorting enabled (so I manually chose something like "Sort by name" before) the new strongfile is randomly placed obove or underneath other file/folder icons/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v3miZ.png" alt="example"  I've spoken to a few other users and it seems like I am not the only one with this issue. This happens ALL THE TIME, in addition to other issues (where the reordering randomly generates an empty column at the center of the window and other things)
