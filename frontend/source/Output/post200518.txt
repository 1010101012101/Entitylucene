What will "rm -rf /" actually do? <body> I know that this is a very dangerous command, but what does it actually do. In other words, to what extend does it delete the hard drive. Does it delete only the user data? Or does it delete root OS files as well. If someone were to activate this command, would it break the OS?

It'll also depend on which version of OS X you're using -- IIRC there was at least one version where `rm` failed as soon as it'd taken out /bin for some reason. On the other hand, when run as root under OS X Yosemite, the destruction is impressively complete.
