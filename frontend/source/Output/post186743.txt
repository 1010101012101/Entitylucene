Reclaim hard drive space from deleted partition and reclaim Apple bootloader <body> I had my system dual-booted with Ubuntu 14.04. However, I found myself not using it enough to warrant the storage space. I deleted the ubuntu partition and the ubuntu swap partition.br However, am now facing two problems that I have struggled to solve.   ol liI have been unable to reclaim the disk space from the deleted partitions. I've tried booting into recovery mode kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd and repairing the disk. The disk repairs successfully, but still remains the same size, and will not let me increase the partition size. /li liThe system is still trying to use the grub bootloader. In order to boot to OS X I have to hold down the kbdOption/kbd key on startup. This issue is more of an annoyance, but I would love to figure out how to solve it./li /ol  Is any of this possible without a fresh install of the OS?  Edit: Screenshot of partition table below. Also, using OSX 10.10.3 Yosemite.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gld9j.png" alt="Screenshot of partition table in Disk Utility"  Edit: Could this have anything to do with the Recovery HD below by osx's hard drive on the partition list? Is it safe to remove the recovery hd given that CMD + R reboots are now an online process?

You provided me with the relevant contents of this table when you posted the output from the command codesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0/code. These values appear to be correct, except for the entry with an index of 3. This entry is shown below.  precode      480002496    1269536      3  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /code/pre  The start and size values of code480002496/code and code1269536/code, respectively, are OK, but the contents should be codeGPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC/code.  To correct the problem you need to boot to OS X Internet Recovery and enter the following commands in a Terminal window.   precodegpt  -r  show  /dev/disk0 diskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0 gpt  remove  -i  3  /dev/disk0 diskutil  unmountDisk  /dev/disk0 gpt  add  -i  3  -b  480002496  -s  1269536  -t  426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC  /dev/disk0 /code/pre  Once completed, you can boot back to OS X and open the Disk Utility application. The "Recovery HD" partition should no longer appear. You will need to move the slider on the "Macintosh HD" partition as far down as it will go. Click the "Apply" button to recover the free space.  Note: The "Recovery HD" partition has not been deleted. Normally, it is hidden by the Disk Utility application. The partition will still appear when using the codediskutil list/code command. When you move the slider down be aware the Disk Utility application will have to relocate the "Recovery HD" partition to the end of the disk. This can take a while, so be patient after clicking the "Apply" button.  h2Example Using a Flash Drive/h2  I tested the procedure using a flash drive. Before fixing, the flash drive appeared as such:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kw1k4.png" alt="1"  Using similar Terminal commands resulted in:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vrbBb.png" alt="2"  This allowed me to move the slider as such:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rNIMV.png" alt="4"  Clicking the "Apply" button produced:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/opvm2.png" alt="5"  In your case, the small free space shown above will not appear. (This is not free space, it is the space taken by the hidden partitions.)  <comment220544> First, delete the grub if you have an EFI partition or an EFI folder in the root directory. Next, edit the question and add what error it exactly shows when you try to expand the HD and use the free space. <comment220559> 1.) Your OS version, please  2.) By "will not let me increase the partition size," do you mean the drag-to-resize partitioning icon is grayed out and unusable, or that attempts to re-partition result a text-based error? 3.) How did you originally set up your dual-boot configuration? Boot Camp, DIY formatting, Mac Utility, Linux utility? The difference among them is .. well.. it can make for quite a difference, indeed. <comment220564> The advice presented in the initial response to your question could prove a tad vexing should you follow through on it without paying attention to your location and the contents thereof, as the Mac also uses an EFI partition for its own boot partition. Deleting it would necessitate a full OS re-installization, and that's a situation you're nowhere close to at the moment. <comment220577> Apologies for some of the confusion. Operating System - 10.10.3 Yosemite. It will not let me increase the partition size as in I cannot drag my OSX partition down. I'll include a screenshot of my current partition table in an edit in a second (although when I tried to partition I was booted in recovery mode). I used a tutorial for installing ubuntu that had me install from a live disk and use GParted to create new partitions for the install. I'm quite new at this so please let me know if I can better answer your questions above. <comment220758> Is there any other information I can provide that would assist in the answering of this question? I'm still unable to solve my problem. <comment221273> If you want help, post the output from the following Terminal application commands: `distutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. Some of these command may ask for your login password. This is normal. None of the commands will change your computer. From what I can see It appears: 1) Your "Recovery HD" partitions has the wrong GUID. 2) The partitions in the GPT are not in sequential order. 3) When you delete Ubuntu the free space was added to "Recovery HD" instead of "Macintosh HD". 4) You may have at least one hidden partition left that needs to be deleted. <comment221276> BTW, if you are tired of holding down the option key on startup, go to "System Preferences" and select "Startup Disk". <comment221277> I'm traveling today but will post all this information tonight - thank you very much! <comment221278> For me to be notified you posted a comment, you have to include @David somewhere in your comment. <comment221445> @DavidAnderson the requested output from the commands you gave me has been posted. I'd appreciate any input or instructions you could point me to. I admittedly am a little clueless as to what I'm doing. Thanks <comment221535> This was incredibly well explained and very thorough. I can't thank you enough. <comment221536> @GC123UNC: Ok, but did it work. <comment221537> yes, it worked great.
