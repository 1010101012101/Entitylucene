Infinite scrollback in Terminal (Yosemite) <body> I would like to save the scrollback history in terminal basically forever.    I don't mean bash history, I mean all the text that ever scrolled past in the terminal, not just the commands entered.  I found the files where they are stored in:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.Terminal.savedState/ /code/pre  But I would like the data to persist beyond current sessions, after I close the terminal, the data persists indefinitely.  Also, is there a tool that will let me read those data files?  Thanks for any info  <answer191864> Here's an option for running a script on startup to append everything to a log file. Searching a text file will likely be a better option than manually scrolling up in Terminal, or filling up a buffer.  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20120507163311559
