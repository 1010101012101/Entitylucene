How to install RGtk2 on OS X 10.10.5? <body> I am trying to install RGtk2. I have installed GTK+ and XQuartz with Homebrew:  precode$ brew cask install xquartz  Warning: A Cask for xquartz is already installed. Add the "--force" option to force re-install. $ brew install gtk Warning: gtk+-2.24.28_2 already installed /code/pre  But when I try installing it I get the error  precodeRgtk.c:7:10: fatal error: 'gdk/gdkx.h' file not found /code/pre  Have I missed installing some necessary package?  <answer212575> Seems like a problem with RGtk2 which does not support Quartz GTK on OS X (and provided by Homebrew). I followed the advice posted here:  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/43290  Which suggests installing the binary version:  precodeinstall.packages("RGtk2", dependencies = T, type = 'mac.binary.mavericks') /code/pre  <comment267949> I just had the same problem and your answer helped. The funny thing, though, is that your link was to an issue that *I* opened back in August. Guess I forgot what I learned! Ha! Thanks again. <comment357222> This does not work on macOS Sierra: `package ‘RGtk2’ is not available (as a binary package for R version 3.4.0)`
