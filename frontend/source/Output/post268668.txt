Can I run two 4k (3840x2160) displays at 60hz on a Macbook Pro 13" 2015 <body> I think the title says it all. Can I run two 4k (3840x2160) displays, both at 60hz on a Macbook Pro 13' 2015? I understand they might need to be SST and each connected to a Thunderbolt 2 port. But I cannot get a confirmation whether that setup would work.   https://support.apple.com/kb/SP719?locale=en_US says:     Simultaneously supports full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 3840 by 2160 pixels on up to two external displays, both at millions of colors.   …   Support for up to 5120-by-2880 resolution at 60Hz on a single external display (model with AMD Radeon R9 M370X only)   Unfortunately, it does not state at what strongfrequency/strong the two displays can be run.   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206587 says:     With OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 and later, most single-stream 4K (3840x2160)  displays are supported at 60Hz operation on the following Mac computers: … MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015) and later.

From the review of the Intel Iris 6100 by NotebookCheck:     All Broadwell GPUs support OpenCL 2.0 and DirectX 12 (FL 11_1). The video engine can now decode H.265 using both fixed function hardware as well as available GPU shaders. Up to three displays can be connected via DP 1.2/eDP 1.3 (max. 3840 x 2160 @ 60 Hz) or HDMI 1.4a (max. 3840 x 2160 @ 24 Hz). HDMI 2.0, however, is not supported.   strongThe capability is there to support up to 3 displays with a max resolution of 3840x2160 @ 60Hz./strong  You connect it via mDP (mini Display Port) through the Thunderbolt 2 port.  <comment337383> I also posted this question at the Apple Support Community: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7802640 <comment337446> Hey Allan! Thanks a bunch, that is the most substantial answer that I received so far (incl. Apple Support) :) I did read the writeup on the Intel Iris 6100. I just wonder whether the Thunderbolt 2 bus (Does such thing exist?) can handle the load. So far, I do not even know if the two Thunderbolt 2 ports are on the same or on two different busses. <comment337465> No problem.  The TB2 bus (which exists) won't apply here.  It's the DisplayPort signal that will apply.  The DispayPort signals exist alongside the PCIe signals on the [Thunderbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderbolt_(interface)) bus.  So, it has more than enough bandwidth. <comment337612> Great! Thanks again. I accepted the answer. It will take .5year until I can plug the devices together and report first hand.
