How do you set the maxopenfiles limit in Yosemite? <body> How do you set a soft limit for codemaxopenfiles/code in Yosemite?  I installed Yosemite last night, and now it's ignoring my settings in my code/etc/launchd.conf/code file:  precode$ cat /etc/launchd.conf limit maxfiles 32768 65536  $ launchctl limit maxfiles     maxfiles    256            unlimited /code/pre  <answer151100> It looks like Apple removed support for /etc/launchd.conf for security reasons. It no longer exists on a clean Yosemite install.  From the launchctl man file:     launchctl no longer has an interactive mode, nor does it accept commands from stdin. The /etc/launchd.conf file is no longer consulted for subcommands to run during early boot time; this functionality was removed for security considerations.   <answer151532> I created a code/etc/sysctl.conf/code file with the following contents:  precodekern.maxfiles=100000 /code/pre  If I run codesysctl kern.maxfiles/code after restarting it does show the new value there.
