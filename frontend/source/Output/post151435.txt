How to programmatically get the path to the wallpaper on the active desktop? <body> I'm trying to get the path to the wallpaper in the active desktop. However, I'm having trouble reliably getting this.  The following sources indicate that code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db/code is a sqlite database with information about the background.  ul lihttp://grahamgilbert.com/blog/2013/10/28/setting-a-desktop-picture-in-mavericks//li ligist.github.com/gregneagle/6225747 (Can somebody prefix this with codehttp/code? SE is preventing me from posting more than 2 links because of my low reputation on this board)/li /ul  However, these sources set a new background and don't try to read the contents of the sqlite database for the active desktop.  I've dumped the contents of this file on my system and have uploaded it as a gist at https://gist.github.com/bamos/6c5fb63ec1d9b8dc9205.  This file seems to contain information about displays, and reading the last value of codedata/code seems to get the active wallpaper emsometimes/em.  ul liIs there a way I can use codedesktoppicture.db/code to get the wallpaper in the active desktop every time?/li liIs there another way I can programmatically get a path to the active wallpaper?/li /ul  hr  Edit: forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1525299 (can somebody add http?) is another source of getting this information with AppleScript, but for some reason the following snippet is returning codeWave.jpg/code when codeWave.jpg/code isn't the active wallpaper.  precodetell application "Finder"     set theDesktopPic to desktop picture     set theName to displayed name of theDesktopPic     display dialog theName end tell /code/pre  To clarify, my wallpaper is set to randomly cycle through a directory.  hr  I tried running the following command as suggested in the answers.  precodetell application "System Events" to get properties of every desktop /code/pre  However, on my system, this outputs:  precodedisplay name:Color LCD, change interval:1800.0, id:69731840, random order:true, picture rotation:1, pictures folder:/Users/bamos/Pictures/wallpaper/nature, picture:/Library/Desktop Pictures/Wave.jpg, translucent menu bar:missing value, class:desktop, /code/pre  which doesn't include the wallpaper of the active desktop.   I disabled the random picture cycling and  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to {"Macintosh HD:Library:Desktop Pictures:Beach.jpg"} as alias' /code/pre  changes my background to the stock beach wallpaper, and  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get properties of every desktop' /code/pre  now shows codepicture:/Library/Desktop Pictures/Beach.jpg/code. However, this is not helpful because I want to get the background when I'm randomly cycling through a directory.  <answer151437> precodetell application "System Events" to picture of desktop 1 /code/pre  View all properties:  precodetell application "System Events" to get properties of every desktop /code/pre  <comment178382> Can you please take the debugging to [this chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/18004/discussion-around-how-to-programmatically-get-the-path-to-the-wallpaper-on-the-a) -- I've made sure @highphi has access.
