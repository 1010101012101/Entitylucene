I dropped my IPhone 5c <body> I accidentally dropped my IPhone 5c, and now it keeps swiping and pressing things by itself. I have to press thing multiple times to get it working, but sometimes that doesn't even work. What's my problem? And can I get it repaired?  <comment341240> #justbringittotheapplestore <comment341246> Your touchscreen has been damaged.  You need to take it in for service.
