Automate printing with options? <body> I am trying to print a file (a pdf), without intervention. Not Automator specific, I can deal with applescript or terminal or whatever. The specifics of what I want are:  ul liPrint to specific Printer/li liPrint to specific Page Size (Non-Standard)/li liAuto-Rotated (Optional)/li liScale to Fit, Print Entire Page (Ends up being 109 to 112%. 110% works)/li /ul  I can do this manually through Preview's print menu, only the page size is non-default, but I want to automate it, drag and drop, somehow.  strongThings I tried:/strong  ol liIf I print from Finder, it uses Preview, but it's blown out of size, and wrong Page size.   /li liIf I drag it onto the printer in ~/Library/Printers/printername, it's like using LP, but without the options.  /li liApplescript's printing options are poorly documented./li liAutomator's "Print Finder Items" it's like #1.  /li liAutomator's "Print Images" is like Preview but "Scale to Fit" does not work like Preview does, I can't choose the page size, and "Auto-Rotate" doesn't work at all./li listrongIf I print from terminal via LP or LPR, I can set page size and orientation/fit-to-page, but I can't scale it to 110%. This is the closest thing to what I want./strong /li /ol  h2How can I do this? It shouldn't be so hard, I want to do what the GUI can, not like I want extra features./h2  Worst case, how can I emulate mouse or keyboard control of Preview's print menu? All that would be needed is to 1. open file, 2. Bring up print menu, 3. switch to a preset or page size, as all the other options strongincluding scaling are default/strong., 4. press print/enter.  <answer230489> Let's split the problem into two parts: scaling and printing.  h1Scaling/h1  You can scale a PDF on the command line. Consider creating a temporary, scaled, PDF to print.   See scaling PDF content and page dimensions from command line for suggested approaches to this. The highest voted answer suggests using cpdf with a command like:  precodecpdf -scale-page "1.1 1.1" in.pdf -o out.pdf /code/pre  An alternative tool is codesips/code. This tool is included with OS X and is surprisingly capable.  h1Printing/h1  As you have discovered, OS X's printing system is the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS). CUPS includes the command line tool codelpr/code which can accept all the settings and options you need.  For printing the PDF via the command line see:  ul liPrint PDF from Command Line – cups-pdf, lpr -P PDF/li liCUPS printing of pdf files/li /ul  To list the available printers, use:  precodelpstat -p -d /code/pre  To print a PDF file to the default printer, use:  precodelpr file.pdf /code/pre  <answer231854> What I ended up doing was using codeopen/code and codeosascript/code along with a tool codepdfcrop/code from MacRumor's forum user strongOligarch/strong (Wayback Machine backup to archive)  precode./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -u in -p 6.68 1.82 -a tr -o 0.14 0.23 &gt; ./0.pdf &amp;&amp; \ ./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -b m -u in -p 3.30 1.82 -a tr -o 0.14 0.23 &gt; ./1.pdf &amp;&amp; \ ./pdfcrop /path/to/file.pdf -b m -u in -p 3.38 1.78 -a tr -o 3.43 0.24 &gt; ./2.pdf &amp;&amp; \ open ./1.pdf ./2.pdf &amp;&amp; \ osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to delete POSIX file "'/path/to/file.pdf'"' -e 'tell application "Finder" to delete POSIX file "'./1.pdf'"' -e 'tell application "Finder" to delete POSIX file "'./2.pdf'"' /code/pre  ol liIt takes the original file, and creates three copies. One with the pdf cropped to size (crop box, none destructive) that I keep, and two cropped to size (media box) that are temporary./li liIt then opens them with Preview, as two pages/files in the same window./li liIt then tells Finder via Applescript to strongdelete/strong the temporary files, in a Finder, move to the trash manner. Same as if I code⌘-Delete/code the files./li liOnce in Preview, I can code⌘-P/code to print both files. Only thing I need to do is change the paper size, Preview handles the scaling./li /ol  Obviously, it doesn't do everything I want, but it helps reducing the amount of manual cropping and going back and forth to make sure everything I need printed is printed.  strongSince CPDF can scale and crop, It should be easier to do all via command line. I just need to test it out./strong  <comment281627> might it be possible to use a `pipe` and do the whole shebang at once? like: `cpdf -scale-page "1.1 1.1" in.pdf |  lpr ` ? <comment281673> With `cpdf` that might be possible. With `sips` it would have to go via a file. I suspect a short bash script or even an AppleScript droplet would wrap the command up well. <comment282605> For emulating mouse or keyboard control (and a slew of other features you'll wonder how you ever lived without) you might check out [Better Touch Tool](https://www.boastr.net/). <comment283199> Considering CPDF can do cropping and scaling in a single command then piping to LP, this should be the best for me. I'll need to test it out.
