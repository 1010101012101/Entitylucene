How to turn off Mountain Lion's screensaver's password requirement? <body> I have the current version Mountain Lion and set the Screensaver to 30 minutes, but since I am the only person that have access to this computer, I would like to turn the password off, but there seems to be no such method?  <answer61164> Under codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy/code there is an option to not require password to wake computer from sleep or screen saver.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zUQqd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer62131> If you turn on FileVault then the checkbox disappears, so your strongonly/strong choice is how long it will take before you need to enter a password. I found this so irritating that I turned off FileVault altogether. Then the checkbox came back and I could get rid of that option.  What is also strange here is that when you have FileVault on (and thus have no choice about having to enter a password) the maximum time is 1 hour. When you have it turned off, not only can you turn the password option off altogether, you also have a maximum grace time of 4 hours.  <comment70565> For some users of Mountain Lion, that check box does not exist. <comment70566> Please, do you use FileVault 2? And what model is the Mac? <comment70573> Depending on hardware I guess? <comment70575> I'm not sure. Please see commentary to the opening question. At the time of your screenshot, did you use FileVault 2? <comment70597> I don't use FileVault... (mine is FileVault, not FireVault 2 on the Mountain Lion)... it is a Mac mini, but does it matter?  I thought Mountain Lion behaves the same no matter what Mac it is <comment70601> The check box in the screenshot by @Hoshts is not seen on my computer running Mountain Lion with FileVault enabled. For security, it makes sense for Apple to limit/remove the preference. <comment71760> I have FV2 enabled but still see this option in Preferences. Strange. <comment166857> For anyone who still gets a password screen after unchecking this, it could be because the user you're logging in as isn't an Admin user. To make the user an Admin, go to System Preferences  Users & Groups  click the lock icon  select the user  check "Allow user to administer this computer"
