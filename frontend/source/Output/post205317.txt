Terminal Ping, how to get simple integer <body> i am wondering how exactly you would get a simple integer result instead of all the miscellaneous information such as the packet size, transmission number and target.  To elaborate:  I would prefer the output to look like:   code117.85/code  A single integer response, similar to how the syntax: codeping -c 1 google.com/code returns a single result, however i would prefer the method to omit the detailed ping report and only displays a single number.  Thanks in advance.  <answer205318> Try this:  precodeping -c 1 google.com | grep "time=" | sed -E "s/(.*)time=([.0-9]+) ms/\2/" /code/pre  If you want to get an minimal value for some number of requests use:  precodeping -q -c 5 google.com | tail -1 | cut -d "=" -f 2 | cut -d "/" -f 1 /code/pre  Replace code1/code in code-f 1/code with:  ul licode2/code for average/li licode3/code for maximum/li /ul  <comment247584> Brilliant, this worked perfectly <comment248796> Or `ping -c 1 google.com | sed -nE "/time=/s/(.*)time=([.0-9]+) ms/\2/p"` if you want to keep it short :-)
