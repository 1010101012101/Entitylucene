Will generic earphones allow basic inline remote / mic capability on my iPhone 6? <body> I'm interested in buying the Sony XBAA1AP earphones, and am curious if earphones that aren't specifically designed for iPhones, but which have an inline remote control / mic, will provide basic remote control / mic features on iPhone devices.  <answer244297> Yes, generic earphones/headphones/earpods will work fine with an iPhone.  I have several non-Apple headphones and earphones from various manufacturers and they've all worked, including the play/pause, ff/rw, volume buttons.  As long as you purchase from a reputable company and manufacturer, like you've indicated in your question, you'll be ok.
