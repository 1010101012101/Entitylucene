How to make brew installed software take effect over the manually installed one? <body> I have an older version of software that I once manually installed through installation package (version 0.6.6 -- I write it down here for later discussion purpose, but the version number is not relevant to this question).  Now I found brew is better why to manage the update/upgrade etc. So, I use brew to install the software by doing codebrew install terraform/code (version 0.6.9 -- again, I write it down here for later discussion purpose, but the version number is not relevant to this question), which is all good so far.  However, when I do codeterraform version/code to query the current effective version, I found it's still the old version.  My question is how I can make the brew installed software take over.  A side question is that which I try to find out terraform's location, by run codewhich terra (hit tab now)/code, which I normally do for other software, the tab won't do the auto complete action for me. Why is that?  <answer224586> The easiest solution would be to simply delete the old version of the software.  If you want to keep both, you'll need to change your code$PATH/code environment variable so that the location of the new version appears before the location of the old version. Do this by editing code~/.bash_profile/code.
