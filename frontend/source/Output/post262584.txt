how to include text messages from backups to iPhone <body> I have a few backups of iPhone, backups of iPhone 4,4s,5, etc. Now I'm going to get aa new iPhone 7 and like before I will use it as new and will not import data from the past. (This is the reason of having multiple backups).  I wanted to include the messages that exist in all previous backups to my new iPhone. Could you tell me if and how could this be done?
