I had messed about with my KeyChains (probably the likely factor in this issue).  To solve the issue I had to completely wipe my Macbook Air, set up El Capitan and iCloud again. strongBefore you attempt to do this, ensure that you have all of your data on backed up to an external drive, not a Time Machine backup./strong   As you can see below CloudKeychainProxy is now not hogging CPU cycles, and my battery life has dramatically improved.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G5y5O.png" alt="Activity Monitor"  <comment261148> I am having the same issue as you. I am attempting to get all data off of my Macbook Air, and start from fresh (will report back if this solved issue). This was never an issue with Mavericks or Yosemite. <comment261325> As a side note, I did try my time machine backup from before El Capitan installed but I was still stuck with this issue after upgrading.
