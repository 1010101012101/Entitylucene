How to set default page size for Pages '09? <body> I'm not sure how I can set the default page size for Pages '09. For some reason, every time I set the page size as A4, it defaults back to US Letter.  I've tried setting these settings:  ul liSettings: Save as default/li liFormat For: Any Printer/li liPaper Size: A4/li /ul  But the settings won't let me choose the 'save as default' option and goes back to emPage Attributes/em.  <answer27194> You could go to System Preferences Â» Print &amp; Scan and at the bottom of the screen, there is a dialog box for "Default paper size". Select A4 there.  This should change the default page size across all programs, not just Pages.  <answer42363> change the region under emSystem Preferences/em  International  Formats. I believe that most of the region settings will cause Pages to default to ISO paper sizes (such as A4). The only ones I know of which result in US Letter are emUnited States/em, emUnited States (Computer)/em, and Canada.  If all you care about is the paper size for new blank documents, you can always save a custom template with your preferred page setup, use that, and not touch your system settings.  <comment31347> Ah yes. I've tried this as well, but to no avail - US Letter was still the default option in Pages, for some reason.
