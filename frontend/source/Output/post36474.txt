PPTP VPN DNS delay <body> When I connect a PPTP VPN on Lion, it takes several minutes for DNS resolution to actually switch over to the addresses that come back over PTPP. Is there some parameter somewhere what would speed up this process?  Here's some output from nslookup which demonstrates the oddity:     /Users/benson/x/oap2 nslookup   server   Default server: 10.0.0.1   Address: 10.0.0.1#53   jira.basistech.net   Server:        10.0.0.1   Address:   10.0.0.1#53      Non-authoritative answer:   Name:  jira.basistech.net   Address: 67.215.65.132   The PPTP connection DNS address is 10.1.0.50, but still opendns.com is in control here via the panera wireless, returning crap advertising pages.  <answer37585> I've not seen this happening with my VPN connections. I think you should add some screenshots of you network configuration screens, strongspecifically the network order/strong, and the dns sections of the VPN connection settings  <comment41638> I've not seen this happening with my VPN connections.

Make an answer so I can accept it?
