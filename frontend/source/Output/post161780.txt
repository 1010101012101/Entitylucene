How to remove Local Disk entries in DCIM sub-folders in iPhone? <body> in iOS 8, multiple entries of "Local Disk" spawned every time I use Windows 7 File Explorer to transfer files to my computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjCQp.png" alt="enter image description here"  How to remove those? and when will iPhone / iOS re-index those random sub-folders in DCIM folder?  <answer162826> Settings  Safari  Advanced  Website Data  Remove All Website Data  Worked for me with iOS 8.  Disconnect then reconnect the phone to the PC and all the "Local Disk" rubbish is gone.  <answer165082> If you don't want to remove all website data then do as follows:  Settings  Safari  Advanced  Website Data  then Edit and proceed to erase each entry looking similar to this "a####.phobos.apple.com" . No more "Local Disk"  and even erased the empty folders. It worked for me.  <comment190590> this works perfectly ! <comment237620> This doesn't work, not at least in Windows 8 and iOS8. I used search for * which lists all photos, videos, folders and "Local Disks". Sorting it by type and then selecting only photos and videos does the job. We lose the iOS folder structure but I did not care for that. <comment259674> Doesn't work on Windows 7 iOS 8.1.
