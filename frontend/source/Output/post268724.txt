Alias shows different locations between Terminal and Finder <body> I have a broken alias displays different locations for the original file depending on whether I am using Finder's "Get Info" command or if I use codels -l/code in Terminal.  In Finder, it says the original location is some non-existent temporary file, while Terminal reveals that the file links to where it is supposed to go.  I believe that Finder's junk file is the one the link actually points to, since using terminal commands to open the file in Terminal give a codeNo such file or directory/code error.  What is going on here?
