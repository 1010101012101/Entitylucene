Boot Camp Windows broken after adding a new partition <body> So I decided to shrink the Mac partition on my SSD and make a FAT partition so that both Mac and Windows can use it. I resized it in Mac, but when I rebooted into Windows, a blue screen appeared with error 0xc0ea000a or something like that. What should I do? (Retina MacBook 12" 2016)  <comment346889> Have you tried booting into windows more than once? Blue screens can be caused by a lot of things? If it happens more than once, then you should be worried. But if it doesn't happen again, everything should be ok <comment346969> Yes, I tried it more than ten times.
