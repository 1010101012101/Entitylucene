MacOSX Installer signed but Gatekeeper complains <body> My C++ daemon for MacOSX is being successfully signed with codeproductbuild/code:  precodeproductbuild: Wrote product to Installers/app.pkg-unsigned productsign: signing product with identity "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: myCompany" from keychain key.keychain productsign: adding certificate "Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority" productsign: adding certificate "Apple Root CA" productsign: Wrote signed product archive to Installers/app.pkg /code/pre  The certificate I am using has been created by first creating an App ID for my daemon, then by requesting a Mac Installer Distribution certificate for the particular App ID.  I can verify that the .pkg is signed with codepkgutil --check-signature app.pkg/code, both with the fresh package file AND with the same package uploaded on Google Drive and then re-downloaded to simulate the download from an exteral site. Both checks give me the following:  precodePackage "app.pkg": Status: signed by a developer certificate issued by Apple Certificate Chain: 1. 3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: myCompany    SHA1 fingerprint: oh happy day 2. Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority    SHA1 fingerprint: oh happy day 3. Apple Root CA    SHA1 fingerprint: oh happy day /code/pre  However, when I try to start the installer Gatekeeper complains: codeImpossible to open "app.pkg" because it comes from an unidentified developer./code.  What am I doing wrong? Do I need a different certificate?  Thank you in advance.  <answer281740> Duplicated question: My signed .pkg file is not accepted  I was actually using a wrong certificate. I will try to confirm it before flagging this as the answer, but the question looks promising.
