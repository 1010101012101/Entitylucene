HDMI an VGA monitors: issues on Mac Mini mid 2011 <body> In my MacMini mid 2011, I'm using two monitors, connected as follows:  ol liASUS VX279 (1080p 60Hz): HDMI-DVI --- DVI-HDMI/li liSamsung SyncMaster 2223NW (1680x1050 60Hz): Mini DisplayPort to VGA --- VGA/li /ol  The two monitors work perfectly, and I use the extended desktop mode. The problem is when I put the mac mini to sleep. When I wake up it, the HDMI Asus monitor turns on normally. The Samsung VGA monitor does not. Sometimes it says that the signal is absent, and sometimes it turns on with a wrong resolution. The only thing I can do is unplug the cable and reinsert it. Only in this way it returns to work properly. But it is unpleasant having to do this all the time. What could be your problem?
