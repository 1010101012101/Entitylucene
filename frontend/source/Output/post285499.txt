Apple Mail Archive <body> If I move E-Mails to archive in apple mail will they still also be on the server?  Or will they only be on my computer then where the archive is?  <answer285500> If you use a email server that uses the IMAP protocol or Exchange all your emails and folders will be saved on the server.   iCloud.com, Gmail.com, Outlook.com use either exchange or IMAP. If you have your own email server, you should connect to it through IMAP.  strongIMAP:/strong     IMAP was designed with the goal of permitting complete management of an   email box by multiple email clients, therefore clients generally leave   messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them.   <comment360034> Which email provider (iCloud, gmail, hotmail, yahoo, or your own domain) do you use? <comment360035> they will be in the archive folder of the email servers <comment360036> @pjctech iCloud, gmail and more <comment360049> I was actually after the export button, which does what I need :) but you answered the question, thank you! <comment360169> I assumed you meant the archive button and folder.
