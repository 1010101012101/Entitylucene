Apple Mail 9.2 Gmail app-specific password not accepted and main pw doesn't last <body> Since I re-activated my Gmail account with 2-step verification on a fresh install of OS X 10.11.3 "El Capitan", I've tried to use a fresh app-specific password for this account on my Mac. Yet, OS X keeps asking for a password and the app-specific isn't accepted but my main pw is, after I've entered the vericiation code sent out via SMS. The problem is I have to do this every day which is a nuisance.  I can't tell if this is OS X or Google, but there seems to me it must be google as it's the responses from their servers that are not what I expect.  Anyone else have seen or can think of a solution?
