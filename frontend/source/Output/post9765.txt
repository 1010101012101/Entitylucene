Insert signature into threaded mail in mail.app <body> When I get a threaded message in mail.app and want to insert my signature under my reply text, then the signature gets inserted at the bottom of the email content.  Is it possible to insert the mail signature just below the reply text I wrote?  <answer9772> Here's the setting you're looking for.  It will always put your sig above quoted text.
