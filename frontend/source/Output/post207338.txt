MBP randomly waking from sleep/hibernation <body> I Have a Mid-2010 Macbook Pro. For many months I've been running a version of Yosemite without issues, but I just upgraded to 10.10.5 this week. I think I was running 10.10.3 before but I don't remember exactly. It must have been that or below as the reason I was upgrading was so I could install Xcode 7.  Ever since then, it's been waking up from sleep at seemingly random intervals. It has a DVD drive which makes noise when it wakes, and it woke my girlfriend and I up at 2AM last night. I hibernated the machine using DeepSleep which I figured would be the end of it. But much to my shock, it partially woke from hibernation this morning to make noise, although when I went to check on it, it appeared to be back in hibernation and required the power button to be pressed to turn back on, after which it restored state normally.  Last night the machine had NO peripherals plugged in at all, with the exception of AC power. Bluetooth power was on but none of the paired devices were on. "Wake for network access" was enabled in the energy saver preferences. I have no sleep or wake schedules set in system preferences.  Here is some diagnostic output:  precode$ pmset -g Active Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  womp                 1  halfdim              1  sms                  1

(Charge:99%)             9 secs     /code/pre  I definitely wasn't using any HI devices at 2AM so that's odd. Dunno what the deal is with RTC/Maintenance.  I've since disabled Bluetooth power and "Wake for network access" but I want to be sure that this is fixed and doesn't wake us up again in the middle of the night. I guess for now I can power the machine off completely or put it in a different room until this is fixed. Or what is meant by "/User" as the wake reason as I also wasn't using my computer at 5:30AM.  Any help interpreting the diagnostics or further troubleshooting advice would be much appreciated, thanks.
