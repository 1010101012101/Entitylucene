How to reset default sidebar favourites icons in Finder? <body> I broke my Mac Mini, trying set some permissions on some folders for web-development, but somehow ended up removing permissions from everything.  I managed to restore permissions, but have had a few issues since, namely the folder icons on the sidebar in Finder are not reflecting the icons they should be.  The desktop also seems slow to refresh when saving a file to it. They don't appear until I do another action.  Is this something I can fix in Terminal or elsewhere to restore everything back to how it was? Will I have to resort to reinstalling Mavericks?  Alternatively, will restoring from my Time Machine have an impact on things like these folder icons.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2uU8z.png" alt="Default favorites icons"  edit:  folder permissions when running ls -le as per answer below   precode drwxrwxrwx@ 16 username  staff    544  5 Nov 21:33 Github  -rw-r--r--@  1 username  staff      0  4 Nov 02:01 Icon?  drwxr-xr-x@ 72 username  staff   2448  4 Nov 01:55 Library  drwx---r-x@ 20 username  staff    680  4 Nov 01:44 Movies  drwx---rw-@  9 username  staff    306  4 Nov 01:54 Music  drwx---rw-@  8 username  staff    272  4 Nov 01:45 Pictures /code/pre  etc..  <answer108311> How did you restore permissions? Manually, or did you use the "Repair" feature in Disk Utilities?  Restoring from a Time Machine backup from before things went bad should work.   One thing you might try before restoring is to delete the Finder preferences. code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code then relaunch the Finder (Hold kbdOption/kbd while selecting the Finder icon in the dock). The preference file will be regenerated with the system defaults.  <answer108378> You probably restored your preferences (not permissions) by deleting codecom.apple.finder.plist/code, right? You'll also want to take out one more file, which handles the sidebar, then reboot:  coderm -rf ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist/code  It probably wouldn't hurt to Verify Permissions via Disk Utility either (since you mentioned them).  <answer108421> reinstalled mavericks over the top and has cleared everything up.  having deleted the plist files in the other answers beforehand.  thanks  <answer124223> I had the same problem as you and it was because I had ACL's on my files in /home. If you have that problem code(0: group:everyone deny write)/code   More info at http://backdrift.org/fixing-mac-osx-file-permissions-and-acls-from-the-command-line  If permissions is not your issue, I've discovered an alternate solution which I posted here. Is it possible to change the Finder sidebar icons  <comment127005> I used the repair feature. this might be an issue, I don't have the  com.apple.finder.plist file. <comment127007> If you don't have a com.apple.finder.plist preference file, then things are certainly "not good" what did you do to your permissions? <comment127008> basically it looks like i removed my rights to access every folder/file under Home downwards. <comment127009> being and idiot, found the file. deleted it. restarted finder. no change. <comment127013> furthermore: I've created a new admin user, it also has the same issue. <comment127023> From the terminal could you let me know what you get when you type `ls -le` This should reveal ACLs which could be messed up or missing. One final trick, try dragging one of the folders directly to the sidebar, see what that does. <comment129858> actually after later restarts and updates, problem has reappeared. <comment129867> tried this, but made difference. thanks though <comment129868> answered question in my answer above. <comment129869> dragging folder to bar replaces the existing folder with the same. no icon change. removing folder before adding folder back in makes no difference either <comment134001> I had the same problem as you and it was because I had ACL's on my files in `/home`.  If you have that problem  (`0: group:everyone deny write`) go http://backdrift.org/fixing-mac-osx-file-permissions-and-acls-from-the-command-line. <comment145140> you should put this as an answer @danger14 so i can upvote it <comment148458> this kept cropping up now and again for some reason. latest update to OSX fixed it. <comment154734> I still think this bug is bizarre.  Took me three months on and off to fix it on my mac.
