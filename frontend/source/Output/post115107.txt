iCal calendar for official holidays in Berlin city <body> Where I can get an iCal calendar for official holidays in Berlin city? Any thing like that?  <answer115126> Like this one?: German Holiday Calendar  I googled: codehttp://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/calendars/ Germany holiday/code  <answer115719> schulferien.org lists all german regional publich and school holidays in multiple format in your case, try the following:     http://www.schulferien.org/iCal/Ferien/icals/Ferien_Berlin_2014.ics   <answer270308> The update url for Ferien und Feiertage Deutschland is: http://www.schulferien.org/deutschland/ical/  They seem to be update every year!  <comment134867> I can Google also. The problem is that the holidays aren't the same across Germany. Each state has its own calendar in one way or another. <comment339679> Welcome to Ask Different!
