Is there a twitter client for an iOS4 Device in Late 2012? <body> I lent an old iPhone 3G to a friend because his had a spill. Unfortuately, it seems the app world had started to pass him by -- the standard twitter client now requires iOS5. Is there a good alternative for him to use or is he stuck with the mobile web?
