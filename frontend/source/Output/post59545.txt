Quickly Access Safari 6 Bookmark & History Address Bar Suggestions with the Keyboard? <body> With the new combined address/search bar in Safari 6, I'm wondering if there's a way to quickly choose an option from the emBookmarks &amp; History/em suggestions using the keyboard. Or some way to have bookmarks titles match as emTop Hits/em the way URLs seem to.  In old versions you could quickly access a bookmark by typing the first few letters of it's name, hitting down and enter. But in Safari 6, you have to skip over 5 Google suggestions first, or just click with the mouse, neither of which is terribly efficient.  I suspect this is a quixotic request, but I'd love to be proven wrong.  <answer59549> Not a real solution, but a little faster then pure kbddown/kbd. You can jump over the different sections with kbdcommand-down/kbd.  <answer59672> You can remove the suggested keywords by checking "Prevent search engine from providing suggestions" in the privacy preferences. There will still be a single action for searching for the text on the location bar, but that's actually useful in a lot of cases.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jpiml.png" alt=""  And if you're used to searching in history and bookmarks, it's much better than this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/12cZ6.png" alt=""  <comment68650> Thanks, that's close enough. I tried some different key combinations, but somehow I guess I missed that one. Go figure. Still not happy with the pattern matching decisions Apple made, but this is better than nothing.
