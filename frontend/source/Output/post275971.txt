Android Studio on El Capitan - issues in setting up the SDK <body> Having issues while trying to set-up Android Studio (latest release, 2.3) on a Mac (El Capitan 10.11.3). Studio is installed, but when I launch it a window for configuring the SDK appears, and after a few passages I get this error:  "An error occurred while trying to compute required packages"  Anyone got this?  <answer276001> This is what worked for me:  ul liDownload the command line tools, place them in the SDK folder (e.g., on mac: code/Users/user/Library/Android/sdk/code), unzip there and then add the tools/bin folder to the PATH./li liInstall the latest platform: in a terminal, execute codesdkmanager "platforms;android-25"/code/li liOpen Android Studio, and go to the SDK Manager (Appearance and Behavior  System Settings  Android SDK)/li liClick on "Edit", and then select the sdk folder. Then "Next"  "Next"  "Finish"./li /ul  I hope this works for you too.

Based on this and other advice, I have been able to step further. Please see here: https://superuser.com/questions/1187647/android-studio-on-mac-el-capitan-issues-in-setting-up-the-sdk/1187742#1187742
