I want to buy an old mac with 10.5 (leopard) but the disks were lost during a move. <body> The owner wants to wipe the disk clean to remove his personal info.  He also has 3rd party applications that will be lost.  Is there any way to move the operating system and 3rd party apps to another drive allowing him to wipe the hard drive of his personal data and then move the os and applications back for me to have them?  Also, is there any way for me to upgrade to maverick for free now that apple's giving it away?  <comment132510> Hi and welcome to Apple.SE Please try to ask one question at the time, this keeps the site organised. It is hard to backup anything without keeping the personal data. What if the 3rd party apps have registration info embedded for example? By creating a new user and deleting the old one, apps will most likely be preserved, but personal data wont. Not sure about it, hence not posting it as an answer. <comment132650> Okay, thanks, new here. 1 question per post, got it.
