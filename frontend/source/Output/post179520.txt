Mac OS X Mavericks starts with question mark <body> Yesterday, I was using my Mac OSX and some applications were using a lot of memory. It wasn't possible for me to finish my Mac correctly and I decided to turn off the computer with the On/Off button. Now, when I try to start it again, a question mark appears.  Questions related to the question mark is very common, but I have a strange problem, I can't do any of those process if I start my Mac with the kbdOption/kbd button held down, or with kbdControl/kbd+kbdR/kbd it starts Disk Utility. If I try to start the System Recovery, any Disk is listed. I can check the disk (it says all is OK), but if I try erase the disk I can't because all fields are disabled.   What I can do?  <comment212816> Could you please elaborate? What exactly couldn't you finish? Also, what does a boot flag have to do with this? <comment212817> I also know that this means your hard drive may be corrupt.. Don't quote me, as I dont know for sure. <comment212844> You can't erase the disk you're booted from <comment212897> @Tetsujin with the disk utility, I can't all the options are disabled
