Safari 5.1.1 SlowDown/Freeze <body> I am tired of how is working Safari on Lion. So the issue is : Safari can freeze at any moment , become unresponsive for some second then refresh page content. If i have more tabs opened , when switching through tabs , all web-pages are not visible (i mean that no content is visible on web-pages) then after some seconds page is reloaded, and everything is fine for a while.  I have an extension (click-to-flash) , and these plug-ins installed : Flip4Mac Windows Media Plugin, iPhotoPhotocast, Java Applet Plug-in, QuickTime Plug-in 7.7.1, Shockwave Flash, Silverlight Plug-In (from Installed Plug-ins). I must mention that Safari even in this case is not crashing. Anyway it is not comfortable using Safari in this way. What can be the problem ???  <answer32359> This (osxdaily.com) has solved my problem with Safari 5.1.1 (I had the same problems as yours)  <comment37070> If you turn off the extension and disable the plug-ins, does Safari still crash? <comment37076> Welcome to Ask Different!
