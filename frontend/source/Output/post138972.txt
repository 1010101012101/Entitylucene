OSX slow netwerk setup after sleep when wired (wireless is fast)? <body> When my mapro6,1 awakes from sleep it takes like 20-30 seconds before the network (and therefor Internet) is working, when i use WiFi its almost instant.  Any ideas?  Thanks!  <answer139089> Wel, guess I found it.  I used a cross-cable (UTP), instead of a normal cable. Although it works fine, it seems the link negotiation takes a bit longer.
