Need a formula for a conditional formatting of a cell based on another cell's data <body> I'm trying to highlight a cell based on another cell's data  Example:  precode  A               B  100% (green)     1    0% (red)       1 or greater    0% (white)     0 /code/pre  So I need to conditional column A so that if it shows 100% Green, 0% with a 1 or greater in B Red, and if it's 0% with a 0 in B white.  Any Ideas?  <answer215545> Sounds like codeConditional Format/code is what you are looking for.  Select the cell which have to be formatted and choose codeFormat-&gt;Conditional Format/code in the menu of Excel.  For more information have a look at: use a formula to apply conditional formatting  <comment260361> Your tag indicates maybe you are using excel for Mac? Which version? <comment260364> @BrandonWard I edited your question. Please check if it is fine like it is now. Also add the possible values (e.g. integers or (0|1|2)) in column B.
