Single user boot : remove read only <body> My OS keeps rebooting since I installed photoshop.  Save mode didn't help.  Trying now too boot on single user, I have a UI to unlock my user account (the mac is encrypted) then I have the command line.  I'm trying to remove everything from Adobe on the launch agent but I can't  codesudo rm -rf com.adobe.AAM.Uploader-1.0.plist/code returns "read only file system" and don't even ask for my password!  Am I good for a reinstall or anything I can do to remove theses files / or fix my boot issue  I'm running 10.11   hr  Update: I forget I need to mount the HD first.  I'm trying now  <answer293186> Fsck followed by mount -uw / fixed my problem!  <comment369901> Ps I still have the Sam boot following but a death screen... Any idea? <comment369911> Can you get into photoshop at all, or does it crash before you could get to prefs? If you can get to prefs, disable the hardware acceleration, Prefs  Performance [maybe reduce allowed RAM while you're in that panel. <comment369914> @Tetsujin I have so crash at the end of the installer, and now straight at boot. Rebooted on single user and I removed every adobe file (I think) <comment369920> Then you need to hone your question - photoshop isn't crashing if it's not even installed yet.
