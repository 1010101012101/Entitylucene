MacBook Air forgetting display arrangement <body> My Mac seems to be forgetting display arrangements for external monitors. It doesn't matter what type of connector it is (Tried Apple converter to VGA as well as non-apple to DVI). Within only a few hours after unplugging the display it will be reset.  Has anyone seen anything about similar issues? Is it maybe Mavericks-related?  <answer122549> Deleting code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist/code as well as all files in code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/code which began with codecom.apple.windowserver/code seems to have fixed the issue.   <comment137376> It sounds like it could be a problem with permissions, check out my answer at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/117038/2313  Even though it is a different problem, it is probably the same solution. <comment137459> Nope, didn't help :( <comment173880> I have the same problem but it persists even after deleting these files, restarting, etc. :( <comment174003> Yeah, I couldn't quite figure out what got it but I thought it was this. Could have been this or a bunch of other things. <comment174102> I've seen others report that the fix you provided worked for them as well, must be something different in my setup.
