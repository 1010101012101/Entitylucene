How to have Siri pick from the list s/he just read to me? <body> Calling my friend XYZ using voice dial has become as easy as dictating one if his cell numbers to dial.   strongemSiri will recite:/strongbr I have two numbers for XYZ. Which number would you like to call?br (abc) def-ghij   or   (pqr) stu-vwxy?/em    How do I pick?  I try insisting emthe first one/em, to which s/he replies "I don't know what you mean by 'the first one'".  How do I select a number without touching the screen and without reciting the entire phone number back?  emI am looking for an answer other than choosing unique types (eg, setting one of his cell numbers to "pager" instead.)/em  iOS 7.1.2, iPhone 5s  <answer155478> em"I am looking for an answer other than choosing unique types (eg, setting one of his cell numbers to "pager" instead.)"/em  then I have no answer ;-)   Change the type &amp; you can just say the type, cell [US] mobile [UK], office, home, etc.   You don't even have to wait for the list, you can just say to Siri, "Call Fred, cell."br  So long as there's only one Fred &amp; one cell number listed for him.  If there are 2 Freds, then "Call Fred Smith"; 2 cells, then differentiate 'work cell' or 'cell 2' etc
