How to set default scroll option for full-screen mode in Mac Preview? <body> Mac Preview always opens in single page or double page view when going to full-screen mode while I prefer continuous scroll. I know I could press CMD+1 every time but is there a way to set this scroll option by default on PDF file open?  Edit: I also tried the Preferences - Opening for the first time, Show as: Continuous scroll. It still always opens files in single page view when going to full-screen mode. Is this some sort of bug?

Went to prefs and changing the option (which I don't remember having changed before) with Terminal:  cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/Data/Library/Preferences/ defaults write com.apple.Preview kPVPDFDefaultPageViewModeOption 0  and restarted Preview  Taken from http://www.amsys.co.uk/2013/08/how-to-configure-os-xs-preview-app-to-always-start-in-single-page-mode/  Didn't work, also not the option in the next post.... hm.  <answer287921> The preview preferences may be overridden by system preferences. Open System Preferences, General.  In middle of panel there is a section that says 'Show scroll bars'. There are 3 options. I'd try the 'always' option and see if that works on preview. I'd leave the preview preference set to continuous scroll as well.  <comment246838> Sorry, I already tried that -- it didn't work. I'll make the edit in the question.
