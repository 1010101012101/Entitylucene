How to find an iMovie project file - Mac- iPad iMovie? <body> I'm trying to get an iMovie onto my iPad in an editable format and I'm told you need to paste the project file into iCloud drive. I can't seem to do this.   Any other ideas on how to get the project into my iPad?  <answer219819> According to iMore : How to move an iMovie project from your iPhone or iPad to your Mac you cannot transfer a project from Mac to iDevice, only from the iDevice to the Mac.     h1Can I move projects back to my iPhone or iPad?/h1      Not at this time, sadly.
