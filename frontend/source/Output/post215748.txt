How do I delete useless Apple Apps on OSX? <body> I tried using terminal with codesudo/code or codesu/code, while I do coderm -rf/code to Photos.app, Chess.app, Mail.app, DVD Player.app, iBooks.app, but it said emOperation not permitted/em.  How can I delete these apps?  (OS X version is 10.11.1)  <answer215841> You don't.  You have no reason to.  SIP is stopping you.  <comment260641> Maybe you should look it up before you do it. El Capitan has SIP (sometimes called rootless). I wouldn't recommend deleting Mail. <comment260658> on 10.11.0 i can do it, and no problem at all <comment260659> Why delete them, they don't take that much space? And I doubt that you have been able to delete them while running any public version of El Capitan (unless you've disabled SIP). <comment260682> Possible duplicate of [Is it possible to delete the "useless" apps pre-installed on my Mac?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65169/is-it-possible-to-delete-the-useless-apps-pre-installed-on-my-mac) <comment260700> Situation regarding deletion of standard applications changed with El Capitan, don't think it's a duplicate as such. The reasons why deleting them is a bad idea haven't changed though. <comment268876> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211922/how-do-i-remove-or-disable-the-photos-app-in-el-capitan
