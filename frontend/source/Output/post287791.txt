My external hard drive doesn't fully mount on macOS Sierra <body> I have a MacBook Air 2016 and a 1TB external hard drive. The external hard drive is in NTFS format and it has 4 folders. But when I mount it, the Finder shows just 3!   strongHow can I fix this?/strong   <comment363389> I'm not sure this is a dupe. "Not showing folders" is not the same as "read & write to NTFS". <comment363552> @Tetsujin Thanks for your comment. Yes, they are not the same but the problem solved after enabling "read and write NTFS".
