How to connect an iPad Air to a Panasonic TV? <body> Is there a way to stream TV from my iPad to my Panasonic TV?  I am a relatively new iPad user with little expertise.  <answer223567> You can use Apple's Airplay technology to stream from your iPad (or iPhone) to your tv, but you need to use an AppleTV connected to your Panasonic through an HDMI port to do so. The AppleTV device takes care of connecting the TV to the Wifi and also your device.

Have you tried anything yet?  Do you have an Apple TV?  Do you have a home wireless network?  Is your Panasonic TV model equipped with WiFi or an HDMI input?  Please provide as much information as you can about what you wish to accomplish with what you have.  To answer your question is difficult without more information about your TV.
