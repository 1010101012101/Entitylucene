Permission denied for symbolic link <body> I'm creating a symbolic link with the following applescript:  precodeon run     do shell script "rm /usr/bin/ant" with administrator privileges     do shell script "ln -s /Users/hordine/software/apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant" with administrator privileges end run /code/pre  The symbolic link is created but when I try to execute codeant -version/code from a terminal window, I get a permission denied error.  How can I create this link so that I DO have permission to execute it later?  <answer94104> Do a codechmod/code on the symlink to give you the rights.  precodedo shell script "chmod 755 /usr/bin/ant" with administrator privileges /code/pre  <comment110318> Which access permissions are set for `/Users/hordine/software/apache-ant-1.8.2/bin/ant`?
