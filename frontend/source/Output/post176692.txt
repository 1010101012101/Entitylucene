Change a printer driver of an already configured printer <body> Is there a way that you can set the printer driver for a printer that is already installed (other than deleting it an reinstalling). When you install a new printer you get an option to set which print driver it uses (see image below).

You have to use the CUPS interface by running codecupsctl WebInterface=yes/code from Terminal and then pointing a Web browser to http://localhost:631. From there:  ol liOpen the Printers tab./li liSelect your printer and select Modify Printer from the second drop-down menu.
