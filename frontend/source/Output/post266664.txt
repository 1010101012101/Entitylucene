Create a macOS installation script with different versions <body> Me and my colleagues constantly install different versions of macOS throughout the day and we used to have a script with a menu that had all the different macOS versions. Simply choose which version to install and point it to the volume and it'd format the volume and install that specific verison.  A nice feature would be to be able to also remove all user/admin/root accounts of a system and reset the setup assistant (we create test accounts from time to time) if chosen.  How would I go about doing this?  <comment334361> Marked unclear: the script was lost? Check your backups! Do you use real machines or VMs? <comment334371> How to reset the setup assistant is covered by an existing question. Can you please be more specific about how your setup is and/or what your question is (it may be as "simple" as "How do I remove all existing accounts from a remote Mac") and why simply using an "empty" installation as a basis for any cloning does not solve your problem.
