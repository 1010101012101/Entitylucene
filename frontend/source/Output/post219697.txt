Can a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) have their hard drives upgraded <body> My friend has a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) -- she wants to install a magnetic 2.5" HDD. Can I install any such drive or do they have to be apple compatible hardware.  <answer219732> Not possible. There's not enough room for a spinning hard drive to be connected inside any retina portable MacBook.   That being said - hose drive would work well externally via thunderbolt or USB and internal non-OEM replacements are available.   To install special SSDs. other than Apple branded look for resellers and online like OWC or RamJet.   <comment265736> Depends, is it the Retina MacBook Pro or is it the non-Retina MacBook Pro that hasn't been updated since mid-2012? <comment265737> Opps @user24601I had the wrong make and model -- it's a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) -- updated the question <comment265738> Opps @user24601I had the wrong make and model -- it's a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) -- updated the question <comment265739> In that case, orkoden is right. <comment265744> The answer is pretty much the same, see the link.
