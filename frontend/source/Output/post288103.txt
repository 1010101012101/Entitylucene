UPDATE:: OneNote: Shortcut to expand/collapse a paragraph in the Outline View not working -- idea for a fix/workaround? <body> I'm trying to use the shortcuts to strong"expand/collapse paragraph"/strong of an outline like detailed here, only using the shortcuts as provided by Microsoft (here).  Shortcuts:   Collapse an expanded outline. ––– Control + Shift + Plus sign ( + )br Expand a collapsed outline. ––– Control + Shift + Minus sign ( - )  What strongactually/strong happens when using the shortcuts is:br Control + Shift + Minus sign ( - ) ––– COLLAPSES the outlinebr Control + Shift + Plus sign ( + ) ––– does not do anything (plays the "err" sound over speakers")    My Mac is running macOS Sierra 10.12.5 and OneNote 15.35.1  strongEdit:/strong I seemed to have figured something out.br It seems to have to do with the Language of the keyboard. Microsoft's published shortcut-combinations are all for an US-style keyboard layout. My mac's built in keyboard has an european layout.    If I change the Layout to an US Layout in em"system preferences"  "keyboard"  "Input sources"  "Add (+)"  "Englisch"  "US"/em  the shortcuts work with the published combinations.     However, that's not helpful as I would like to keep using the European layout.br strongHas anyone got an Idea how to make OneNote recognize the position of the european-layout-position of the "plus" and "minus" keys - they seem to be the main problem?/strong (keys for ctrl and shift don't differ between the two layouts.)
