Where are the config files for Pidgin via Homebrew? <body> I installed Pidgin via Homebrew. I'm looking for config files such as codeaccounts.xml/code and codeprefs.xml/code.  On Linux, I believe they're located in are in code~/.pidgin/code, and code%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Pidgin/code on Windows.  I would expect them to be somewhere in code/usr/local/Cellar/pidgin/code, but they're not, as far as I can tell.  <answer258498> All config files for pidgin reside in the (invisible) folder ~/.purple.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3mg4.png" alt="enter image description here"
