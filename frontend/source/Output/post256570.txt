cmd+option replaces keyboard panel <body> I want to use some application keyboard shortcuts.  Example on Sublime Text: kbdcmd/kbdkbdalt/opt/kbdkbd//kbd = Block comment current selection   I don't understand why my keyboard changes as soon as I press (command+option).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6bWH1.jpg" alt="Keyboard panel autochange"  You may notice on the image above, that panel has got replaced after command+option and so I'm unable to tab on /   <answer256582> If you are talking about creating something in System Prefs/Keyboard/Shortcuts, you just type the key where the / is normally found.  What you are seeing is normal behavior in the Keyboard Viewer and does not affect the ability to make shortcuts using the unmodified keys.  <comment320095> When I press "cmd"+"alt/opt"+/, it does not function and brings Help-Search. <comment320108> So you need to go to system prefs/keyboard/shortcuts/app shortcuts and change or uncheck the default short cut for Show Help Menu. <comment320113> Hi, it worked! thanks :-)
