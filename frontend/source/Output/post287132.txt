AppleScript fails with timeout error <body> I'm very new to Apple Script.  That said, I'm running a Parallels Desktop virtual machine and simply want to quit the Parallels app before Time Machine begins it's nitely backup and then relaunch Parallels after Time Machine has completed the backup.    I've tried using the following scripts below, however when executed both produce the following error "AppleEvent timed out. (-1712)".  Here's where it gets really strange, both scripts work perfectly just so long as the screen is awake, but if my computer has been idle for a while and the screen is asleep, I get the previous error.  I even tried creating an Automator script by recording my cursor movements and it tested fine while the screen was awake, but again failed once the computer was idle and the screen went to sleep...  precodetell application "Parallels Desktop" to quit  tell application "Parallels Desktop" to activate /code/pre  Model: iMac 2011br Browser: Safari 602.1br Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10)
