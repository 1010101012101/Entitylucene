Boot Camp partition broken and can't be repaired in OS X 10.10.4 <body> Suddenly my Boot Camp partition vanished: not visible in Finder, not visible on startup. In Disk Utility I can see the volume, but it's broken (verification log):  precodeVerifying volume "disk0s4" Verifying file system. ** /dev/rdisk0s4 Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: 2b0601 File system check exit code is 8.

But here I see some differences - now naming is not detected and you can't see BOOTCAMP in Finder sidebar. So, I'm not taking chances and won't follow this guide until someone will advise me so.  iMac14,3 (21.5-inch, Late 2013) , OS X Yosemite (10.10.4)  Here is codesudo fdisk /dev/disk0/code  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55      Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 - 1564180479] &lt;Unknown ID&gt; *2: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [1564180480 -  389343232] HPFS/QNX/AUX  3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      /code/pre  <answer196733> strongTo recover the Boot Camp partition/strong (Source):  Enter:  precodesudo gpt -vv -r show /dev/disk0 /code/pre  to get some partition informations.  Download and install GPT Fdisk (aka gdisk).   Download and install TestDisk.   Open TestDisk and make a deep search for your Windows partition.  Leave your Testdisk display and start a new Terminal Window. You need to use the following steps. If you see any error messages during the following steps, please stop and post back here with the error message. The following steps have values from your Testdisk output (and you can verify) in Steps 7 and 8. They should be the same as in the gpt output. Please notice the '+' sign in step 8 (this is called offset notation). The text in parentheses is for informational purpose to describe the action being taken. Gdisk has one-character commands except when entering numbers.

Rebuild MBR to match the new GPT information thus resetting the Hybrid MBR. Use defaults for other questions (like partition codes). The only values that need modifications are the Boot flags and step 10. Accept all other defaults that Gdisk offers. These steps can be repeated if you make a mistake before you get to Step 12, otherwise start from Step 1 for these steps. Step 6 has numbers which are typed with a space between the numbers.  ol licodesudo gdisk /dev/rdisk0/code/li liP  (Print list of parts)/li liR  (Recover)/li liO  (print current Hybrid MBR)/li liH  (chooses Hybrid)/li liPartitions numbers to be hybridized: 2 3 4/li liY  (Good for GRUB question)/li liN  (part 2 boot flag) N  (part 3 boot flag)/li liY  (part 4 boot flag make NTFS bootable partition)/li liO  (print current Hybrid MBR)/li liW  (Write the new MBR)/li liY  (Yes! write the new MBR)/li liReboot/li /ol  strongTo make Windows bootable again try the following/strong:  Boot from your Windows DVD/USB-Stick  ol liOpen command prompt from Windows recovery option menu.

It does give the option of wiping the Hibernation data and doing disk repair.  <comment235023> @grgarside Thanks for the corrections! <comment235039> Post the output of `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0`. Also, add the model of you computer. <comment235042> On my computer, I can not run Verify Disk or Repair Disk on a NTFS formatted volume using the Disk Utility application. On your computer, what does the Disk Utility application say the format of your Windows partition is? <comment235055> @David It's MSDOS FAT <comment235056> @klanomath sorry, here it is http://nerdr.com/bootcamp-partition-lost-repairing-mac-partitions/ <comment235058> @klanomath As I stated, once and fixed with help of this guide. It worked well like half year after that. And than failed suddenly. The only thing I could think of is an update I did a week ago. <comment235059> @user2624390 Did you already try the solution [here](https://discussions.apple.com/message/28429393#28429393) (which is similar to the one mentioned in the "guide" <comment235069> @klanomath Thanks a lot! This is exactly my cause. After following the instructions I'm now able to boot into BOOTCAMP partition and access files through Finder, but still fail to load Windows. <comment236251> How do I boot in Windows Recovery? If I boot from my BC created USB it goes straight to the installation dialog. <comment236255> I found several sources: [Win7](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6785154) and [Win8/8.1](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode): - To get to Windows Startup Settings in the Windows Recovery Environment Step 1 <comment236266> TY, @klanomath. <comment314963> what if there isn't a Windows recovery menu ?
