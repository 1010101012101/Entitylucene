Apple Font Tools cannot install in Macbook Pro El Capitan <body> I downloaded OS Font Tools, release 4 beta 1 (osxfonttools.dmg) and try to install in Macbook Pro El Capitan, but installation failed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ROnHU.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C0eyC.png" alt="enter image description here"  anyone knows the reason?  <answer211729> This is extremely annoying. The font tools are only available as Release 4, beta 1, and nothing has changed since 2011-10-11. And now, on top of that, the installer fails on OS X 10.11 El Capitan.  The reason why the font tools can no longer install on El Capitan is most probably the new System Inegrety Protection (SIP). Among other things, it prevents certain critical System directories from being modified. The current font tool beta 1 release predating El Capitan by many years, it does not take the SIP into account. Instead, it tries to install the font tools into code/usr/bin/code, one of the directories protected under the SIP. This will fail.  h2Updating from a system where the font tools had been installed/h2  If you are lucky, you have upgraded from a system where you had the font tools previously installed. In that case, they are not gone. More importantly, the still appear to work all right. They only have been moved by the Capitan installer to the following directory (where em{UUID}/em is a some code):  pre/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-{UUID}/QuarantineRoot/usr/bin/pre  This means you can copy them from there to an executables directory, e.g. code/usr/local/bin//code. Alternatively, you can use them in-place by adding their directory to your PATH variable. You can achieve this by issuing the following command in Terminal.app (it will add a line to your code~/.profile/code file):  preecho export PATH=\$PATH:`echo /Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-*/QuarantineRoot/usr/bin`  ~/.profile/pre  h2Other things you might try/h2  There are some other thing you might try. Disclaimer: I have not tried any of these:  ol liIf you have time machine backups of a system where the font tools were installed, you may copy the font tool executables from code/usr/bin/code to an executables folder on El Capitan, e.g. to code/usr/local/bin/code. You especially want to move the font tool executables that begin with codeftx/code./li liYou can unpack the codeOS X Font Tools.pkg/code file and install the font tools manually, see How to unpack and pack pkg file? or Unpacking an OS X pkg file./li liYou might be able to install the font tools after disabling the SIP. This can be achieved by following the procedure outlined e.g. in How to Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless) in OS X El Capitan.  When the SIP is disabled, a modification of code/usr/bin/code should be possible again. Hopefully, there is nothing else that prevents a successfull installation of the font tools.  Afterwards, it seems like a good idea to turn the SIP back on. I do not know what happens to the font tool executables that have been added to code/usr/bin/code when turning the SIP back on. I guess they might be moved to another quarantine directory. In that case, you can follow the same procedure outlined in the previous section (Updating from a system where the font tools had been installed).  If turning the SIP back on completely eliminates the font tool executables from code/usr/bin/code without making any quarantine backups, you may copy to executables to another location such as code/usr/local/bin/code before turning the SIP back on./li /ol  <answer231350> Here is how I did it. Get it downloaded from apple (here: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/?q=font ) and run these.  precodepkgutil --expand OS\ X\ Font\ Tools.pkg tmp cd tmp cd fontTools.pkg mv Payload Payload.gz gunzip Payload tar -xvf Payload /code/pre  Apologies if I forgot any parts but that is basically it.  <answer250050> This problem has been fixed in the emFont Tools for Xcode 8 beta,/em released on 2016-06-13. The release installs just fine. The release notes explicitly affirm that installation is now possible:     This package will install command line utilities, Font Tools   framework, Blinker, Font Proofer X, FTXViewer, Kerx Tester, MorxTester   and UniCharter. These tools support running on OS X 10.11   The current release is emFont Tools for Xcode 8 beta 4,/em released on 2016-08-01.  <comment287206> Worked for me. Came from http://stackoverflow.com/a/8314197/129202 . Could successfully use ftxdumperfuser later. Just a gotcha: the unpacked files are within the fontTools.pkg folder, which "needs" to be unpacked first or we can't see the contents on Finder. Anyone ending up here probably gets it anyway.
