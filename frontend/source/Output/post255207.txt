Moving the selection to the beginning of the line <body> Although I'm a Mac user for several years now, this noob-question is stuck in my head since the beginning:  I'm selecting a text by holding down emShift/em and moving around with the cursors.  Imagine I start at one line, press emDown/em and then want to move my selection end to the beginning of the line (just like pressing emLeft/em all the way): how do I do that on Mac?  Pressing emHome/em or emCmd+Left/em always moves the beginning of the selection to the beginning of strongits/strong line (which is also kinda cool, but doesn't help me here).  I've even made a gif about this to demonstrate:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVPjt.gif" alt="Demonstration video"  <answer255214> Once you grasp the pattern, it's quite easy...  To move to the next/last letter - kbd → /kbd or kbd ← /kbdbr To move to the next/last word - kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd → /kbd or kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd ← /kbdbr To move to the beginning/end of a line - kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd ← /kbd or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd → /kbd   Hold kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd whilst doing any of these &amp; it will add to your current selection if you are moving away from your original insertion point, otherwise it will remove...br ...with the exception of kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd, which will always add.  As you've discovered, all these functions use your emoriginal cursor point/em, not the beginning/end of your current selection. That would perhaps require a little mind-reading, to know which end you wanted to work from ;-)  For your specific situation, if you start with kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd held, then kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd → /kbd, then just kbd → /kbd - 'to end of line plus one character'br Alternatively, holding kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd, then kbd ↓ /kbd followed by a number of kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd ← /kbd would be quicker than just kbd ← /kbd - 'to middle of line below minus several words, one at a time'  <comment317810> That is quite a nice overvie of the selection operations. Thank you, but basically you're saying, that my original request simply isn't supported in macOs, right? :) <comment317811> Correct. It's the slight inconsistency of Cmd that stops you, as it always adds to the end of the current selection, whereas the others will remove if moving back towards your insertion point.
