Why does the App Store think Xcode 4.2 is installed? <body> I'm trying to upgrade Xcode from 4.1 to 4.2.  However App Store thinks that it's already up to date, which it is not.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T5xt0.png" alt="screenshot of App Store" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzTRo.png" alt="screenshot of Xcode"  I am a registered Mac and iOS developer. I don't think 4.2 is under NDA.   How can I fix this?  <answer30208> Delete the XCode installer in /Applications, restart App Store. Now you will have an "Install" button for XCode. Download the installer and run it.  <answer30263> Actually, chances are the installer is for Xcode 4.2. The App Store is a bit misleading, since it doesn't actually install Xcode, but downloads the installer and puts it in /Applications/Install Xcode.app. You still need to run the installer. The App Store knows nothing about if you've done that or not.  <comment34648> Ah, simple and elegant solution. Nice. Thank you for a quick solution. <comment34788> Note that you have to go back to Xcode's page on the App Store from the search bar, Xcode 4.2 doesn't show up as an upgrade.
