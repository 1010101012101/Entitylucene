Is there an option to merge notes from gmail and icloud <body> I purched yesterday the iphone SE, and I got bumped into some sort of issue. I would like to merge both my icloud notes and my gmail notes. (such that all of my gmail notes would be added to the icloud. the opposite - icloud notes being merged to gmail notes would also be good for me)  is there any reasonable and comfortable way to do so? thanks!  <comment301757> Do you have a Mac handy, signed into your Gmail and iCloud account? (Please comment back with @JohnRamos so I can help you more.) <comment301764> @JohnRamos thanks for your comment, unfortunately I'm a windows user. Ubuntu is handy as well.. <comment301848> Can you get your iCloud notes on either computer? <comment301849> So Apple's suggestion for how to export all of your notes is...copy and paste. "To copy notes, open the Notes app at iCloud.com. Copy the text of each note and paste it into a document on your computer, such as a Pages or TextEdit document. Save the document to your computer. To export your notes as PDF, open the Notes app in OS X Mountain Lion or later. Select the note, then click File  Export as PDF and choose a location."
