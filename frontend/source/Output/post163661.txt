How can I change how often iCloud data gets synced on my iPhone 6? <body> When I make changes to Contacts on my Macbook, they tend to take a while to get synced up with my iPhone 6. I was wondering if there was a setting on the iPhone (or perhaps even on iCloud.com) that would allow me to set a more frequent synch schedule.  <answer163662> I believe this is not possible. Your iPhone automatically syncs your data with icloud.  <answer163782> There is not timer setting for sync. Usually it is triggered by changes in a app like contacts.  If you want a instant sync Quit Contacts and restart. That should trigger the sync.  <comment191656> if you close and reopen contacts app that should do the sysc now. <comment191804> You might want to rethink your answer :)
