Can't find installed software <body> Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but I've tried all sorts of things, and need help.  I needed to use some software from the Internet, so I got some installers for them. All of them are em.dmg/em and have em.pkg/em installers. I went through the installers and installed them, but after installing them I can't find them anywhere. Could someone please help me find them?   Logs tell me they were installed:  precodeJun 27 15:10:55 myMacBookAir installd[15594]: Installed "u-he TyrellN6" () Jun 27 15:24:43 myMacBookAir installd[15594]: Installed "Crystal" () Jun 28 11:07:11 myMacBookAir installd[15594]: Installed "Serum" (1.017) /code/pre  When I use Spotlight, all I find are the em.dmg/em files. I running OS X El Capitan.  I did look in the Applications folder, they were not there.  <answer244196> Try hitting strongCommand+L/strong (which should open the installation log details) while you're running the installer pkg and you should see the installing target path in those logs.  <comment300817> Did you look in Finder under `Applications`? <comment300819> I did. Wasn't there :( <comment300867> Did you try using Spotlight or Launch Pad? ...Or look for a new folder: ~/Applications? <comment300937> Aren't these all audio plugins? What VST or AU compatible audio software are you using? <comment300985> Thanks :) I found the path and found the things. Strange that spotlight didn't work.
