Notes 10x Duplication (Without iCloud) <body> My notes.app is going crazy. When I create a new Note and then hit save, the note is not only duplicated but 10x duplicated.  I have icloud sync deactivated. As far as I can see, the note is duplicated for each word in the file with more than one letter.  What can i do?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fn7v9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer128993> Try to close strongNotes/strong  and delete code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Notes.plist/code.  Relaunch strongNotes/strong to see if the same problem exits.  h2Update/h2  This method suggested will remove all your local Notes and resync with the notes stored in iCloud. Just for record:  ol liOpen your favorite Terminal. (If that sounded weird, just open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app)/li liQuit Notes.app./li liEnter coderm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes./code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li /ol  <comment152000> Hi. I tried your suggestion but that does nothing. It still creates one new note per word. <comment152004> You might want to try this [suggestion](http://woikr.com/apple/fix-icloud-duplicate-notes-issues-in-mountain-lion/), but all your notes will be deleted. <comment153075> Thanks for the hint. Would you add this as a answer so I can approve it? <comment153137> Updated the answer. So the iCloudâ€™s notes remain intact? <comment153293> I have disabled icloud sync for notes a while ago because I taught this would cause the problem. I'll re-enable it and check back here. <comment154168> Okay. I tested it. It still creates lots and lots of duplicates :( Well I guess I'll have to ditch notes.app and search for another app. Thanks for your help anyway. <comment154171> Try Simplenote, it has a nice app for both iOS and Mac. <comment159234> That Simplenote is nice. I'm gonna be using this from now on :D thanks for the hint.
