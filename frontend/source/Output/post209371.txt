Deleted all partitions on Fusion Drive. Don't know how to recover <body> I'm kind of a novice here, and I think I got in over my head. I was trying to do a clean install of El Capitan on my 5K iMac. It has a 1TB Fusion drive.   I booted from a USB drive, entered Disk Utility, clicked the single partition I saw under the Fusion Drive, then erased it (pretty standard.. done this before). I was given some kind of error, then the partition disappeared.   Now, whenever I boot my computer and open Disk Utility, it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CS3qD.jpg" alt="No Fusion Drive partitions"  No partitions under Fusion Drive. Clicking the Partition option doesn't give me any options (everything is greyed out and non-clickable). Clicking the First Aid option doesn't work either. It pops up a window asking if I want to Run or Cancel. Clicking on either does nothing. The window just sits there.   Like I said, I'm kind of a novice, so I don't know what to do from here. Any help, please!?  <answer209378> Could you manually erase the drives via terminal, then recreate a fusion drive.  To manually erase the drives, go into terminal and do codediskutil cs list/code. Then you'll need to do codediskutil cs delete (lvgUUID)/code.

Everything important is already backed up. <comment252873> Looks like the first step (erasing) wasn't necessary. But the second step (recreating) seemed to do the trick. Got everything reinstalled and it's working great so far. Thanks!
