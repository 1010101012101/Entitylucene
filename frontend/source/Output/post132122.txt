Running Mac OS X in non-apple hardware <body> I want to know if its "legal" to run Mac OS X in non apple hardware.   If not, what is the point of having to run Mac OS X in a apple hardware, when apple hardware is running Mac OS X already.   <answer132123> It is against the terms of the EULA:     2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.br   A. Single Use License . Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, unless you have purchased a Family Pack or Upgrade license   for the Apple Software, you are granted a limited non-exclusive   license to install, use and run one strong(1) copy of the Apple Software on   a single Apple-branded computer at a time/strong. You agree strongnot to install,   use or run the Apple Software on any non-Apple-branded computer/strong, or to   enable others to do so.   However, Apple has historically not prosecuted individuals who violate this for hobby purposes, and have only gone after people who sell preinstalled systems (such as Psystar) or published how-to guides that involve downloading pirated/pre-modified versions.  And, of course you get absolutely no customer support or guarantee that it will continue to work.  <comment155399> “If not, what is the point of having to run Mac OS X in a apple hardware, when apple hardware is running Mac OS X already.” — Because you pay for the hardware. The Mavericks upgrade is free. Also, OS X depends very heavily on the hardware involved, architecture, etc. I'd imagine that supporting and debugging OS X on other hardware would be a nightmare.
