How to download OS X El Capitan without Apple hardware <body> I recently purchased a MacBook (Mid-2009), but the hard drive is empty, no OS X and etc. I want to download the Install OS X El Capitan.app and install it, but I don't have any other Mac hardware to do that with. What should I do?  ol liGo to Apple Store and purchase the install disc?/li liMy friend has iMac and ask him if he could download the installer and make the USB Installer?/li /ol  <answer244568> Apple will ship physical media (at a cost) and/or support you for free online to get the steps to reinstall the OS that shipped with that Mac.  Newer hardware support internet recovery, but I would start with this support article to see which OS your Mac would get from Apple if you contacted them at https://apple.com/support  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204319/li /ul  Most 2009 Macs shipped with 10.6 so you'd probably be better off buying a second hand copy of Snow Leopard DVD and then upgrading to 10.6.8 that gets you the Mac App Store. At that point, you could download Lion or a newer OS and then make a recovery USB installer and not need the DVD evermore.  <answer244570> There is no OS X El Capitan install disk. OS X is distributed through the App Store now.  Yes, ask your friend to create a bootable installer for OS X El Capitan. It should be a fairly straightforward process.   Once you have the drive, hold down the option key while restarting your Mac to boot from the installer USB.  <answer244573> You can use Diskmaker. It will let you create a bootable USB disk and then install OS X.  <comment301411> This would be far easier than my solution - but it's not really helpful if " i don't have any other Mac hardware" means access to hardware as opposed to "personally own and have ready next to me" :-) +1 nonetheless since it's the most straightforward to the newest OS that should run on 2009 hardware. <comment301412> Yeah, I just figured asking a friend who has a Mac would be much simpler than contacting Apple Support to have an older OS X install disk shipped over (which could take a while) and then downloading/upgrading to El Capitan. <comment302288> Does internet recovery work? I don't know if it supports that model
