How to change the default opening application for a file created by touch? <body> I create a file by codetouch myFile/code in the Terminal.  When I open this file in the Finder, it opens with TextEdit. But TextEdit is not ok for me, because it automatically transforms the character code'/code into codeâ€˜/code, which is not satisfactory for coding.  Thus, I want to always open these files with Sublime for instance.  But, when I kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd this file to change the default opening application for such files, I get an error message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNROj.png" width="400"  Is there a way around?  <answer120320> Are you appending a file type when you create it, or is it truly "myFile" and not "myFile.txt" or similar? You can't set a default program for a file with no set type. For any other file type, you should be able to change the default program.  Not a fix, but a workaround: codeopen -a SublimeText myFile/code to open it in the program you specify, rather than the default program set for that file type. You can also control-click on files in Finder and use "Open With" or just drag the file directly onto the app icon in the Dock to do it faster.  <comment140312> What error message? <comment140349> This one (see my edit). <comment140350> There is no type. But, the file is opened automatically with `TextEdit`. On the contrary, for some files, the `Finder` does not open at all ("this file is not recognized") <comment140581> Weird. Wondered if the file contents had anything to do with how the system handles the document. I just created a zero-byte, no extension, empty file in Terminal using Touch, it shows as a "Document" and automatically opens with my default text editor (Textwrangler) when I issue "Open" command from Terminal. But Get Info shows that "TextEdit" is the default program to open these files. So it isn't necessarily guessing based on file content, either. <comment140586> How do you set "your default text editor"? On a `.txt` file? <comment140738> I believe I must have done that at some point. Probably changed all, as I was tired of TextEdit popping up instead. TextWrangler also has command line tools, which I installed; not sure if they change the default "open" response but if I type "edit (name of file)" in Terminal, it opens in TextWrangler.
