Bootable cloud backup services? <body> After investigating Box, Dropbox, Crashplan, Mozy, Carbonite, backblaze.com I'm struggling to find a service that offers all the following:  ul liBacks up files to the cloud, that is accessible 24/7 on mobile and web /li liCan mail a bootable backup of your system on demand /li liWorks with macs/li /ul  Does any service like this exist?  <answer251803> My own solution to this problem, for both Macs here is   ul liLocal Time Machine backups, hourly, on-site/li liBackblaze once a night [best for my data plan]/li /ul  That way, even if the building burns down, my maximum data loss is one day.br Backblaze is accessible from any web browser &amp; files can be downloaded on demand; or if the data is huge, can be mailed on HD. It doesn't, however, contain the OS itself, only your data, prefs, settings etc.  Additionally, I swap out the Time Machine drives once a year, when I do any major upgrade - 10.10 to 10.11 etc.  I also make sure I have at least one clone of the current boot drive, though I don't keep it up to date on any regular basis. It will contain enough historical data - old installs I've lost the disks for, audio plugins where the authorisation site no longer exists, etc.    I also make sure to have Recovery Partitions on more than one drive.  A further step would be to have an additional Time Machine drive, which normally lives off-site.  I just checked - Backblaze is also available for iOS &amp; Android - though it's not something I've ever really investigated.  <comment313027> **"Can mail a bootable backup of your system on demand"** What, _exactly_, do you mean by this? <comment313068> @IconDaemon - Backblaze, for instance, will mail a HD containing your backup if you request one [at a cost, of course] - but it is not bootable as Backblaze doesn't backup the system itself, just your data.
