My app store is not working! <body> I think it is because of the apple 9.0.2 update. When I try to dowload a app it makes a loading sign, but then it says get. Then I click it and it loads and then says get. I have read answers and tried them, but they do not work! What should I do? I do not want to restart my device!  <answer210760> According to Apple Support System Status, now, the iTunes Store Service may be unavailable for some users.
