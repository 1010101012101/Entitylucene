Are IOS apps able to update in pieces? <body> I remember (perhaps wrongly) an AirBNB update being several megabytes, implying the entire app.  Today's update is only 129 KB.  Are they allowed to just update portions like MacOS updates?  <answer276721> The iOS App Store supports delta updates since iOS 6.  In iOS 6 to 7.0.x, changed files are downloaded when updating an app. Since iOS 7.1, only the changes in each file are downloaded, reducing the update size even further.  https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1779/_index.html  <comment348334> Perhaps my memory is wrong, then.  Thanks!
