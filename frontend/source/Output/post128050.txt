Macbook pro ejects every CD/DVD just after a few seconds <body> This problem happened suddenly on my MacBook pro: when I insert a CD/DVD, it tries to read it for a few seconds (the motor of the DVD drive is working) and then it stops, and ejects the DVD.  I have read in many forums that this is a dead condition for DVD drive, and should be replaced. But some others also suggested the lens might require cleaning. Does anybody have experienced the second situation (i.e. can the problem be solved using DVD drive lens cleaner kits)?  <answer128055> Lets analyze:  The Loading/Unloading works !  The spin motor works !  So electromechanical it is OK.  Since you would have to take it out anyway here are the instructions how,to open it  and how to clean the lens.  <answer128073> I had the same problem after updating to Mavericks. Resetting the NVRAM solved it.  <answer200036> Try the following steps and I am sure it will be fixed.  ol liClean the SuperDrive’s slot with compressed gas/vacuum cleaner./li liReset the NVRAM/PRAM and SMC  ul liReset NVRAM and PRAM:br Shut down the computer. Holding down the Command (Apple), Option, P, and R and then hold the Power button simultaneously, 3 times and wait for 3 loud chimes./li /ul/li liDelete the Finder’s preference files  Some people have reported successfully fixing Optical CD/DVD Drive on Mac or SuperDrive issues by deleting the Finder’s preference files (don’t worry, the Finder will automatically make new ones). You’ll want to delete two files: “strongcom.apple.finder.plist/strong” and “strongcom.apple.sidebarlists.plist/strong”. Both of these files are located in Users  [Your User]  Library  Preferences./li liRun Disk Utility and Repair Disk Permissions/li liDelete the following configuration file to create a fresh copy  precode~/Library/Caches (your local Library directory).

So obviously not a long term solution..  <answer293280> This has happened to me a couple of times over the years, all I do is hold down the command key and the disc drive accepts it.

It's also agains the terms of the site. <comment357599> So, what you are saying is that it's a *physical* problem with the drive meaning it should be *serviced*?
