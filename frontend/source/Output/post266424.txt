How can I de-compress a source file on my basic MacBookAir (macOS Sierra Version 10.12.2) <body> I've downloaded the source file from  https://arxiv.org/format/1610.01410v2  How can I decompress it to obtain the plain text (say, in a TextEdit file)?  The file I downloaded is designated   1610.01410     that is it does not have a .gz or .tar extension  Can I issue certain commands in Terminal? Do I need more apps installed?  <answer266425> You can find out the type of find using the strongfile/strong command in Terminal. In this case we get:  precode# file 1610.01410v2 1610.01410v2: POSIX tar archive (GNU) /code/pre  So, you can open it up using tar, from the terminal:  precodetar xvf 1610.01410v2 x defectfcn.eps x sepvol2ment.tex /code/pre  Or, just rename it to 1610.01410v2.tar and let the Finder handle it.  <comment334066> It worked--thanks, Alex!
