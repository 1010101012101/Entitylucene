iPhone 4 is stuck in a boot loop, has a broken power button -- how do I put it in DFU mode? <body> I have an iPhone 4 that has a broken power button. There is no warranty because I bought it from my friend.  It has never been a problem because I had AssistiveTouch, until now.  I went to use the iPhone one day and it was stuck in a boot loop.  I have never attempted to jailbreak it or install 3rd party software onto it. When I connect it to iTunes it says that I need to respond on the iPhone before I can restore or sync it. I can't respond because it's in a boot loop and I can't enter DFU mode because the power button is broken.  Is there a way to put the phone in to DFU mode when it's power button is broken?  UPDATE: After I made this post, I plugged my iPhone into a Samsung wall charger and it booted properly. I used it all day, until it died. Once I got home, I plugged it into the charger, and now it's stuck on the boot loop again. When the iPhone booted normally, iTunes allowed me to put files on it, etc. I have already tried RecBoot, and iTunes won't let me sync.  <answer108813> If you're able to have iTunes recognize the phone and are able to attempt to do a restore, you can use redsn0w to modify a download of the current iOS firmware version (the version you have on the phone) to create a new firmware file whose purpose is just to boot up the phone in DFU mode (without the having to use the power/sleep and home buttons).  The entire process is described in this tutorial by iClarified - How to Enter DFU Mode With a Broken Home or Power Button (it's for Windows, but it's the same process on OS X).  ul liDownload the latest version of redsn0w for your OS (OS X or Windows)/li liDownload the right firmware for your current iOS version for the iPhone 4 from Apple through the direct links on this iOS firmware download page/li liExtract the redsn0w zip file and run the redsn0w application/li liClick the strongExtras/strong button in the main window/li liClick the strongEven More/strong button in the Extras window/li liClick strongDFU IPSW/strong/li liAcknowledge the dialog that describes that this is for devices with broken buttons/li liChoose the firmware file you downloaded earlier from Apple/li liredsn0w will let you know once it's done creating a new firmware file for DFU mode (the name would start with ENTER_DFU)/li liConnect your device with iTunes open and in the emSummary/em view, click strongRestore/strong while holding kbdOption/kbd (on OS X) or kbdShift/kbd (on Windows)/li liWhen iTunes prompts you to choose the firmware, select the ENTER_DFU firmware file/li liOnce the device is restored, it will be in DFU mode/li /ul  <answer108867> Download and install Recboot. This will often let you put the phone in recovery mode. here is the link http://sebby.net/recboot-mac/recboot_2_2.zip  <answer118215> If your iPhone is stuck in recovery mode, DO THIS: (ON Screen USB pointing to a CD with a Music Note).  ol liMake sure your iTunes is up to data, if not re-download itunes./li liafter re-installing ITUNES, plug your iphone via USB into your computer. ITUNES will automatically pick it up and a pop up box will probally say that your IPHONE is in recovery mode would you like to restore?/li liClick the restore tab. Note - If ITUNES if out of date, this will not work. Note - Do not do this over WIFI Note - Do not interrupt the restore Note - If you did not make a previous back up, your IPHONE will restore back to the factroy settings.  /li /ol  All this happened to me, fortunately I made a back up. I hope this helps.  <comment127524> Do you really need hardware DFU mode or just normal recovery mode? <comment134953> Have you managed to fix it? I have the same problem with my ipad <comment143988> maybe if the software on your phone is acting as not expected and also the hardware is defect it's time to think about a new phone ;) <comment214067> Since this restores the device, it will wipe all data, right?
