A turning gear appears when I run this workflow, why? <body> I am running the following script (called codeRestart AppleTV/code) using automator :  precodeon run {input, parameters}    do shell script "sudo killall coreaudiod" with administrator privileges    return input end run /code/pre  However, I get the following in the statusbar :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/40DJj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The terminal code DOES run, but the gear never disappears unless I manually click the codex/code button .. How can I get rid of this automatically or prevent it from appearing in the first place ?   --Note : This only happens when I run it by double clicking the exported .app file, but not when I run the code through automator.  <answer105151> Try:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set myPassword to "My Password"      ignoring application responses         do shell script "sudo killall coreaudiod" password myPassword with administrator privileges     end ignoring end run /code/pre  OR  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set myPassword to "My Password"      ignoring application responses         do shell script "sudo killall coreaudiod &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;" password myPassword with administrator privileges     end ignoring end run /code/pre  <answer240186> adayzdone's suggestion to route output to dev/null also fixed the spinning gear that was appearing when I used Automator to run Firefox profiles.  So, something like this in a shell script:  precode/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -P 'Web Dev' -no-remote &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp; /code/pre  Thanks!  <comment123646> The edit fixed it. Can you please explain what you have done ? For personal learning purposes. I see that you added `&/dev/null &`, what does that do ? <comment123647> &/dev/null & redirects both stdout and stderr so the command is not waiting for a response.
