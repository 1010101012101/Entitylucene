Connection drops after `MacAuthEvent` times out. How can I make it more stable? <body> I am troubleshooting network connectivity issues and I found some log messages that could point to their root cause.  precode12/04/2015 15:38:03.000 kernel[0]: MacAuthEvent en1   Auth result for: d0:2d:b3:33:a2:c6 Auth timed out 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: MacAuthEvent en1   Auth result for: d0:2d:b3:33:a2:c6  MAC AUTH succeeded 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link UP virtIf = 0 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: AirPort: RSN handshake complete on en1 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: wl0: Roamed or switched channel, reason #2, bssid d0:2d:b3:33:a2:c6 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: en1: BSSID changed to d0:2d:b3:33:a2:c6 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: en1: channel changed to 1 12/04/2015 15:38:06.000 kernel[0]: en1::IO80211Interface::postMessage bssid changed /code/pre  What could trigger the authorization time out? Looking at the logs I also see something weird. Apparently the embssid/em didn't change but my Mac thinks so, and it doesn't look quite right. Is there something wrong in my network setup?  <comment214556> you are using en1! is that on Ethernet cable , since the WiFi is normally on en0. <comment214559> In my system, pretty much a vanilla installation of Yosemite, I have the Ethernet network on en0 and the WiFi network on en1. As far as I can tell I didn't change any setting to get to this configuration. <comment214560> ok, looking at your log and comparing it to what I have, the first time out can happen, but it immediately tries again and succeeds. The bssid change is normal (I have it as well).  kernel[0]: MacAuthEvent en0   Auth result for: 10:c3:7b:51:2f:00  MAC AUTH succeeded... kernel[0]: wlEvent: en0 en0 Link UP virtIf = 0... kernel[0]: AirPort: RSN handshake complete on en0... kernel[0]: wl0: Roamed or switched channel, reason #8, bssid 10:c3:7b:51:2f:00... kernel[0]: en0: BSSID changed to 10:c3:7b:51:2f:00
