How can I name desktops/spaces in El Capitan? <body> I would like to give names to different spaces; currently a new space get the default name codeDesktop n/code where coden/code is a number. How can I give it a meaningful name?  <answer211958> Nop, there is no way to do that =/ strong-- Now it's possible (EDIT)/strong  By the way, you can put an application into fullscreen and the Desktop will take the application's name.  strongRelated Questions :/strong  The commercial TotalSpaces by binaryage allows you to name spaces.  strongPatrix :/strong     May be worth noting that you need to partially disable SIP in order to   use TotalSpaces, see http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan   hr     There IS, actually, a way to name your spaces. SORT OF.      That is, you can't change the name that appears under them when you   use Mission Control (which I will go on record saying is one of   Apple's biggest mistakes--Spaces was a million times better, even   though it too was crippled in some respects), but you can assign names   to them and make it easier to tell them apart.      The trick is that you can assign different desktop images to each   'space' (now called a Desktop). This will help make them easier to   tell apart. As far as naming, this will be a huge pain, and definitely   not ideal. But a kludgey solution is all Apple leaves open to us. You   have to put the name on the image. Yup, open an image editor and add   some text on top of those lily pads, or that lion's head, or whatever.      Yes, that sucks if you'd like to regularly name and rename your   spaces. But if you have a few that you use most of the time, you can   create a few desktop images with the names on them, and just live with   it. I wish I could give a better solution, but it's out of my control   obviously. This is, unless someone discovers an as yet hidden setting   somewhere in OS X, or until Apple realizes their mistake and fixes   Mission Control, the best we can do.   https://superuser.com/questions/313387/changing-name-of-space-in-mac-os-x-lion  hr  How can I rename desktops in Mission Control?  hr  strongEDIT (from redolent) :/strong  http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan-with-sip  <answer223261> A very low technology but quite direct solution is to assign keystrokes to each desktop (Preferences - keyboard - shortcuts - Mission Control : allows you to assign ^1 to Desktop 1 and so on). Then write your desired Desktop Names on a small stickie note (a physical one!) and stick it near the number keys. All your Desktop names are constantly in view, and each is just a single keystroke away...  <answer225349> I have found that opening one app per desktop names it after that. In my work that's really helpful because it allows me to have google gasmask open in one, terminal running my local server in another, atom in another and so on, very helpful that it names it after the app running!  <answer231199> UPDATED SOLUTION:  I came up with a better hack inspired by Karl's answer. Open up the Stickies app. Right click on it on the Dock and select Options - All Desktops.  Create one sticky. In it create a list like this:  precodeDesktop 1 - Email Desktop 2 - Gaming Desktop 3 - Home Business /code/pre  Make it tall enough and the font large enough so that it is legible when in Command Center.  Now, when you go into Command Center, your "legend" will be available on all Desktops so you can quickly see which one to switch to.  ORIGINAL SOLUTION:  Here's another hack. Open TextEdit and create a new document. Change the font size to something like 175 points and reshape the window to be very short and very wide. Type in the name you want for that desktop. Then duplicate the document, move it to a new desktop and change the name visible there.  As a result you can usually read the names in Mission Control (as long as a window isn't obscuring it) and you can easily switch to a Desktop by name by showing all TextEdit windows and selecting the correct one.  <answer243673> You could also make a screenshot of the application. Then set that as the desktop wallpaper for that space.   <comment255922> afaik, it couldn't be done in Lion & that still hasn't changed - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18029/how-can-i-rename-desktops-in-mission-control?rq=1 <comment255931> May be worth noting that you need to partially disable SIP in order to use TotalSpaces, see http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan <comment271919> Clever! I don't know if you're serious or not, but I'm giving this an upvote because it seems like some people would actually find it useful. Nice hack! <comment273104> +1 for Apple to add this feature. <comment273480> The app has to be in fullscreen mode in order to give space a name. This is in the accepted answer. <comment286933> Not anymore! http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/elcapitan-with-sip <comment287008> I have edited my answer ;) <comment311944> How was this not built-in from the get-go? They could have added this in half a day. <comment344976> I like this one
