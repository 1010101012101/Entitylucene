Can not run ack after installing it using MacPorts <body> After installing p5-app-ack using Macports I can see it is installed correctly. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zrbzD.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can not run it however. I get codeack: command not found./code and codewhich ack/code displays nothing. How can I see where port installed my ack and how to add it to the executalble PATH?  <answer82004> MacPorts, by default, installs into code/opt/local//code, judging by the screen shot ack should be in code/opt/local/perl/p5-app-ack//code if you used the default install path. Make sure that path is in your $PATH environment variable.  To add it to your path edit your shell config file (probably ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc) and add or modify the following line. codeexport PATH="$PATH":/opt/local/perl/p5-app-ack/code  I don't use MacPorts for ack, I install it manually with the following command from the ack install page.  codecurl http://betterthangrep.com/ack-standalone &gt; ~/bin/ack &amp;&amp; chmod 0755 !#:3/code  This will install ack into the code$HOME/bin//code folder as a single large perl file and I did not have to modify my $PATH variable.  <comment94541> I see it in: /opt/local/libexec/perl5.12. Is it correct install location for binary? <comment94542> And I get: export $PATH='$PATH':/opt/local/libexec/perl5.12 -bash: export: `/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin=$PATH:/opt/local/libexec/perl5.12': not a valid identifier when I try to export <comment94543> It is 'export PATH...` Leave off the "$" Sorry about that. I fixed the post. <comment94544> Thanks. I ended up copying ack executable to the /opt/local/bin anyway. <comment94557> fwiw brew seems to do a better job at ensuring all binaries are symlinked to /usr/local/bin.  I ran into so many issues like this using ports that I just gave up and went to brew.
