Where did these creepy google/gmail icons come from? <body> I just noticed them, I suspect/hope Chrome somehow placed them there, they are not removable by normal methods, they only open Chrome when clicked and nothing else  Google is getting pretty creepy, when a new thing appears that I didn't put, I generally suspect malware  (Photos icon kept for context) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxtOd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer181617> After slightly more digging, I see that Chrome strongnow/strong (it's a new behaviour, likely 2-3 months old) bundles them with new installs, since I use the chrome command separately to create new instances, it added those icons just now, for that instance specifically, so when I click them, they just open the main Chrome and not the webpages  Still pretty creepy tho, they seem to be only removable from ~/Applications - and a restart is probably needed for a refresh  Edit: After a while the icons disappear after removing the files
