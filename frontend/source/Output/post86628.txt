When Get Info window is open you can select what app to open it with and choose to open all similiar documents with the new app as well.  <answer94725> Go to this link . It solves the problem . http://www.photoshopessentials.com/essentials/default-image-editor-mac/  <comment100171> in the get info window you can set the VLC s default application for all your video files. Just make sure you open the right file type, video or pic, than select your preferred application to use, and set it as default application. <comment100752> You might need to perform some more troubleshooting. The steps you describe should work to set the document type and launch services database. If you use tools like Onyx or clear caches, they might be messing up the integrity of the system. If not, you might need to reset the caches / launch services database.
