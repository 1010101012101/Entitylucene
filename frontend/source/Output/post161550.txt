Will it hurt my Macbook Air to be plugged into a "Uni Pak II" which is a dimming power source? <body> I'm at a conference and the only plug is a "Uni Pak II" which is a dimming power source (here's the manual).  At first my charging indicator on the end of the MBA plug didn't light, but I slid up the analog slider and it lit up (I knew it had worked yesterday!).  Is there any chance of it harming my MBA or power supply to use this?  <answer161564> I make no guarantees here.  Probably no harm will come to the MBA.  The power is buffered through the transformer in the power adapter.  You emmight/em burn out your power adapter if you vary (dim) the voltage while it is in operation.    I would also strongly suggest not plugging in the power supply to the adapter until you have adjusted the adapter to full power.  <answer161565> In general, it isn't a good idea to put a power adapter on a light dimmer as the circuitry could malfunction if the voltage is too low.  That being said, I believe the 45W adapter for the MacBook Air will survive- it just won't charge if the dimmer reduces the voltage below 100 volts. The AC is converted into DC and then applied to a voltage regulator circuit which typically shuts down when it isn't getting enough.
