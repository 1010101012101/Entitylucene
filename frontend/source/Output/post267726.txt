Identify Missing System Font <body> After installing Sierra and a number of other fonts from Google Web Fonts, I now see the 'question mark' against any list items either within the actual system UI and other applications such as Chrome.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/APkP5.png" alt="System Example" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1zQPQ.png" alt="Chrome Example"  strongEdit:/strong I have already attemped two possible solutions:  ol liFont Book for Mac: Restore standard fonts/li liHow to Restore Default Fonts on Mac/li /ol  <answer267789> Run codesudo atsutil databases -remove/code, then reboot.  atsutil is the CLI for the font registration system. Resetting the database can help clear up errors like this. Also see Check mark disappeared from dropdowns.  <comment336150> Thank you so much. I would not have thought to search for "check mark" as I associated the question mark with missing fonts that don't work through browsers if you have noscripts or alike, enabled. Now I know :) Thanks again.
