SSTP from Mac OS X El Capitan via easySSTP: Connection drops <body> So a coworker came in with her new Mac and wanted to connect in via VPN. We used to use PPTP which worked fine. But as of the latest OS updates, Apple products doesn't support that protocol anymore. SSTP was setup on our TMG Forefront 2011 firewall/router.   I installed an sstp-client and EasySSTP but I get connection drops after 1-3 seconds.   Any suggestions?
