KeePass application with synchronization support on a Mac? <body> I'm looking for a KeePass application for use on Mac OSX.   KeePassX and KyPass 3 but both lack support for synchronization of KeePass 2 (.kdbx) databases.  ul liKeePassX will just plain overwrite the database. /li liKyPass 3 will do you the courtesy of alerting you of a potential data loss before overwriting a database./li liKeePass is a third option, but I have't not been able to get the application to work, let alone test synchronization./li /ul  What Mac OS X apps support strongsynchronization/strong of the kdbx database that stores credentials in this open source format?  <answer142369> The problem is the .kdbx-file.  The solution is to download and install KeePass Classic 1.27 on your Windows machine, strongwhich still saves the database file in the older .kdb format/strong. This .kdb file can be cross-opened in both Keepass Classic and KeePassX on your Mac.  To make them synced across devices I would recommed using Dropbox in which you save your .kdb database file. Obviously this is not a real-time syncing application so you cannot have the apps open on all devices at the same time and see the changes. It is a save-close-sync procedure inbetween. However it works flawlessly this way.  Equally, now this dropbox-synced .kdb-file now works on iOS through the excellent little PassDrop app :-)  <comment150410> I got a message from the KyPass developer, telling me that synchronization support is "in the pipe :)"
