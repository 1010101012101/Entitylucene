New folders are created in root instead of currently selected folder <body> When I click on a folder and choose File-New Folder the folder is created in the root directory of my current view instead of the currently selected (highlighted) folder.  How do I make it so when I create a new folder it will create the folder inside of the current highlighted directory?  <answer3669> Open the folder you want to create the new folder in first (double-click). Then choose File-New Folder or Shift-Cmd-N.  <answer3676> You can't.  Finder creates new folders in the folder currently being displayed, not the folder you've highlighted.  First you have to display the folder you want the new one in - double click it, then create the new one.  <comment3437> oh, i thought you could because someone told me theirs creates the folder in the highlighted folder.
