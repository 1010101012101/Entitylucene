Where can I find a list of MAMPs? <body> I'm looking for a MAMP packaging = Apache + MySQL + PHP bundled together for Mac OS X (which is my OS). Where can I find it? Is there an "official" site where I can download it from?  [ I know that there are Apache and PHP shipped with Mac OS X, but I don't want to use them, because it seems that if I do it, and later upgrade them, I may have trouble in the case Apple provides a system update which reverts or conflicts with my "manual" upgrade. Can you confirm that? Here is the link: 1]  <answer37516> There are a few, but my favourite is Zend's own, fully integrated hassle free controller  Zend Server Community Edition  <answer37522> You could have a look at MAMP (there's a free and commercial version)     MAMP is installed in the typical Mac fashion: very easily. MAMP will not compromise any existing Apache installation already running with your OS X. You can install Apache, PHP and MySQL without starting a script or having to change any configuration files!      strongPhilosophy/strong: MAMP was created primarily as a PHP development environment for Macintosh computer and should therefore not be used as Live Webserver for the Internet. In this case, we recommend that you use Mac OS X server with the provided Apache or a Linux server.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QL0Ih.png" alt="MAMP screenshot"  Included programs &amp; libraries  ul liApache 2.0.63/li liMySQL 5.1.44/li liPHP 5.2.13 &amp; 5.3.2/li liAPC 3.1.3/li lieAccelerator 0.9.6/li liXCache 1.2.2 &amp; 1.3.0/li liphpMyAdmin 3.2.5/li liZend Optimizer 3.3.9/li liSQLiteManager 1.2.4/li liFreetype 2.3.9/li lit1lib 5.1.2/li licurl 7.20.0/li lijpeg 8/li lilibpng-1.2.42/li ligd 2.0.34/li lilibxml 2.7.6/li lilibxslt 1.1.26/li ligettext 0.17/li lilibidn 1.15/li liiconv 1.13/li limcrypt 2.6.8/li liYAZ 4.0.1 &amp; PHP/YAZ 1.0.14/li /ul  <comment42575> It says "not for production use". :/ Any others? <comment42599> From the zend website. "Zend Server Community Edition is a fast and reliable PHP application stack. It is completely free, and you can use it in development, testing and production. Windows, Linux, Mac OS X and IBM i are supported." <comment42600> this is really only for development and testing purposes only, the site states not recommended for production use <comment42634> Yes, true. Forgot to mention that - added a paragraph to my answer.
