Duplicate Tracks in "Music" App <body> I used ITunes to download to my new IPad3 a variety of songs and albums I had already purchased.  However, in some cases, I have two copies of every song.  When I play an album with the "Music" app, I can see two copies of each song - and yes it plays both copies as it moves forward.  I've seen instructions online of how to get rid of ITunes duplicates on a PC.  But I'm dealing with my IPad3, not a PC.  <answer47448> You should have duplicate tracks on iTunes as well. If not, then try this out  ul liPlug in you iPad and open iTunes. /li liOn the "File" Menu Click on "Transfer Purchases from Brent's iPad" (I Assumed the name of your iPad but you get the point)./li liWait for sometime for all of your purchased tracks to transfer into you computer (PC right?)./li liAfter that you can try out the steps mentioned in the link you posted. This will erase all the duplicates from your iTunes Library./li liAfter all is done, Sync you iPad and your duplicates should have been erased./li /ul  brbr Hope it works!  <answer48314> I went to the Genius bar at the Apple store.  They simply had me delete the songs from my IPad, and re-download them.  The duplicate tracks problem was solved.  Thus both creating this problem and solving this problem required no connection to a PC or any other device.    In short, the problem was entirely within the IPad / ITunes synchronization.  It is VERY GOOD to know this remedy for this problem!!!  <comment54305> You're sure you don't have duplicate tracks in iTunes as well? <comment186109> Not much help if you have thousands of songs and they're all duplciated. It could take a month to delete them all.
