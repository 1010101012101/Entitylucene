Mac Finder - create a custom type when arranging by "kind" <body> When viewing files by arranging them by "Kind", the Finder lists the files in various categories or types. In my attached example, you can see it has listed two types - "Images" and "Documents". The problem is under "Images", it's grouped both .jpg and .tif files together. I'd like to see these listed in their own types. So is there a way to customise this? Rather than "Images", I would have "TIFs" and "Jpgs".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RH5L4.png" alt="enter image description here"
