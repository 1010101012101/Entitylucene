In Mail is it possible to copy the date and time to the clipboard from a mail message <body> In my todo list, I like to refer to email messages based on the date they were received so I can simply find the message at a later point.  For example,     ol   liFollow up locking issue (see Peter's email 25th Feb 2014 18:04)/li   /ol   Rather than transcribing the message date by hand, I'd rather copy it from the mail message and paste it into Notes but this doesn't seem possible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oaA7X.png" alt="The date in a Mail message"  There is no selection cursor when I hover over the date, just a "grab hand".  Are there any tricks to copying a mail message's date to the clipboard?  <answer122483> Apparently there is no option to copy date directly from mail message, neither in regular view, nor in "sort by thread" view.  The fastest method that I came up with was to reply to the email message and copy date from quoted part of it and discard draft afterwards  <answer122487> You could use the messages show Header to copy that and more or any information from.

Copy/paste it in the Applescript editor and hit run to see what it does (make sure Mail is open and has a message selected).  precodetell application "Mail"     set theSelection to selection     set theMessage to item 1 of theSelection     set theDate to date received of theMessage end tell set theDateFormatted to (short date string of theDate &amp; " " &amp; time string of theDate) set the clipboard to theDateFormatted as string get the clipboard /code/pre  To make the script useful you should make a service out of it using Automator and assign a keyboard shortcut to it.br Or, if you're using a launcher like Quicksilver or Alfred, you can save the script somewhere and launch it using the launcher. How to do that is content for another (probably already answered) question though.  <answer122502> This doesn't get you the date in text format, but when I grab using that grab hand cursor I can drag it into notes. There is then an icon with the subject of the email which, when clicked opens that email (albeit in a new window).   Might be helpful.   <answer122507> As you mention that you use the date to find the message later another method is also possible.  If you use a Cocoa app (e.g. TextEdit) for the todo list you can make a link to the actual message such that you don't have to search anymore.br This is done through the message-id of the message, found in the raw source. This old hint explains how it works, and here an Applescript is shown that copies the message id of a selected message to the clipboard.  The Applescript looks as follows:  precodetell application "Mail"     set _sel to get selection     set _links to {}     repeat with _msg in _sel         set _messageURL to "message://%3c" &amp; _msg's message id &amp; "%3e"         set end of _links to _messageURL     end repeat     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to return     set the clipboard to (_links as string) end tell /code/pre  Now if you paste the link in your todo list in TextEdit you can right click it, hit codeOpen URL/code and the message will pop-up in Mail.
