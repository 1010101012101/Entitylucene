Mac formatted Hard drive does not show up in bootcamp Windows 10 <body> I have a WD 2TB Hard drive. The Hard drive is working fine on macOS but doesn't show up in bootcamp windows 10. It gets connected but does not show up However Pen drives are working fine on Bootcamp. Please help!  <comment317513> When you say it "doesn't show up" do you mean the drive doesn't appear as a connected device in Explorer, or that its contents can't be viewed? <comment317541> It appears connected in disk management, but not in explorer. <comment317544> Is the drive encrypted? Have you tried assigning it a drive letter in Disk Management? <comment317606> It does not show any option to assign drive letter in disk management.
