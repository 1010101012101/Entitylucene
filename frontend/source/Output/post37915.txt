Why does mobile Safari revert to "Never accept cookies"? <body> Every few days Safari on my iPhone (iOS 5.0.1) reverts to "Never" accept cookies. I put it to "From Visited" but it switches back shortly thereafter.  Discussion elsewhere suggests an Exchange link may be at fault (and I do download email from a work account) but nothing conclusive.  This problem breaks logging in to most web sites.  <answer40414> Possible fixes:  Make sure there are no restrictions on cookie permissions, if you are a part of an Exhange account. It has been reported that turning off iCloud Bookmarks may fix this issue. To do this; Tap Settings  iCloud and then tap the Bookmarks slider off.  <comment43547> I have this problem too. Anyone? <comment45836> Thanks for the suggestion. iCloud Bookmark syncing is already off on my phone.
