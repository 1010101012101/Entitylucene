Safari bookmarks to CSV or excel <body> is there a way to import or convert the bookmarks.html generated by safari bookmark export menu into a CSV that can be imported to excel with 2 columns, URL and Description? The way it works actually is that the HTML file contains only descriptions with a clickable link and whether you import it to excel, you get only one column with the same theme: clickable links.  <answer128787> ul liExport bookmarks from Safari into codebookmarks.html/code/li liOpen Terminal and run  precodesed -n '/&lt;DT&gt;&lt;A HREF/s/^.*&lt;DT&gt;&lt;A HREF="\(.*\)"&gt;\(.*\)&lt;\/A&gt;/\1;"\2"/p' bookmarks.html &gt; bookmarks.csv /code/pre/li /ul  This will create a code;/code separated list containing the URL and the name (in "").  <comment150888> Perfect, that's what I was looking for!
