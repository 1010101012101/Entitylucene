com.dashlane.DashlaneAgent still trying to be loaded <body> I have removed Dashlane using the documented procedure, yet launchd is still trying to load com.dashlane.DashlaneAgent. I have tried issuing codesudo launchctl remove com.dashlane.DashlaneAgent/code with no success (the command succeeds, and codelaunchctl list/code does not show the service, but upon reboot, a codelist/code again contains the service name). I've also looked in code/private/var/db/launchd.db/code and not found any entries for this service.  I did find lines for this service in code/var/db/com.apple.xpc.launchd/code in both codeloginitems.501.plist/code and codedisabled.501.plist/code. When I remove those lines and reboot, they simply reappear.  So this service launch is coming from somewhere; does anyone know where?  <answer221350> It turns out that codeDashlane/code was still in my code.Trash/code; deleting it from code.Trash/code solved the problem. I don't understand why; perhaps someone else does; but it seems worth recording here.  <comment364245> Same here. When I emptied the trash it stopped.
