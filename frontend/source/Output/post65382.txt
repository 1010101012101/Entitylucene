How to migrate from Parallels to VirtualBox? <body> I've tried Parallels and it's great but I still find it quite "expensive" so I would like to try out VirtualBox.  Is there a way to migrate my Parallels installation to VirtualBox?  The versions:  ul liMacOs X 10.7.4/li liParallels 7/li liVirtualBox 4.2.1/li /ul  I've read some articles but they're quite old and don't match with my versions. Any help?  <comment76817> What do you want to migrate? Existing virtual machines? <comment76821> If you want to migrate existing VMs, this will depend on the operating system running inside them. On the surface it's just moving/converting the disk images, but you're likely to run into driver problems with some OSes. <comment76834> Yep, exactly. I would like to move my Win7 installation from Parallels to VB. <comment83497> Are you running Parallels on a Boot Camp partition, or a dedicated Parallels virtual machine file?
