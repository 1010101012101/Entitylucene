How to view iTunes U without itunes? <body> I want to view Stanford's iOS programming course.  How can I see it without installign itunes on my PC and on my Android mobile device?  <answer92928> h2How to see iTunes U courses without iTunes/h2  iTunes U courses are RSS feeds, so you will need:  ul liAn strongRSS reader/strong, either web browser-based, like Google Reader(*) or Feedly, or standalone, like RssReader.  Make sure that in either case it can display H.264/MPEG-4 videos.  (*) Google Reader will not be available after July 1 2013./li liThe strongfeed URL/strong, which for the iOS programming course Coding Together: Developing Apps for iPhone and iPad (Winter 2013) is:     https://itunesu.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/LZDirectory.woa/ra/directory/courses/593208016/feed /li /ul  For example, after subscribing with Google Reader you'll see a list with links to the course videos:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Frgp2.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2How to obtain the feed URL/h2  Neither Standford University nor iTunes Preview publish the feed URL, so you will need iTunes to get it:  ol liOpen iTunes and look for "Stanford coding together"/li liSelect the course and subscribe:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XbgH7.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNavigate to iTunes U, right click the course and select emCopy iTunes U URL/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0KdCx.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <answer118334> Here's an alternative which worked for me without using iTunes:  ul liGet course URL, for example: ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/course/this-text-doesnt-matter/id775395339/li /ul/li liUse a feed extractor like feedflipper. This eventually gives you the raw xml file:  ul lihttps://p1-u.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/LZStudent.woa/ra/feed/COFFWM26TD/li /ul/li liThe file is served as codetext/rss/code so may not display nicely in the browser. ul liOpen with an RSS reader strongOR/strong/li liDownload as code*.txt/code file, reopen in firefox and use DownThemAll or alternative strongOR/strong/li liCopy the entire XML file and use a link scraper like the one built into JDownloader./li /ul/li /ul  <answer132188> If you have access to a computer with iTunes, go to the iTunes Store and find the iTunesU 'casts you want to save. Drill down to the class's page (it lists all the episodes in the class, and lets you play them if you want), look on the left under the main class icon. There should be two buttons: strongSubscribe Free/strong and strongGet All/strong.  strongGet All/strong will download the episodes to local machine. Once they are downloaded, go into the iTunesU section in Library (left pane in iTunes main program window.)  Once the iTunesU pane loads, right-click (PC) or ctrl-click (Mac) any of the episodes, and select "Show in Windows Explorer" (PC) or "Reveal in Finder" (Mac). The directory with all of the episodes will open.  Now that you know where all of the episodes are you can copy them to removable media and move them to your own system.  <comment155371> you might replace "Macintosh" with "friend's computer". It doesn't have to be a Mac.
