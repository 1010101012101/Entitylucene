Disabling iMessage Reactions iOS 10+ <body> Many teams I interact with use iMessage as part of their productivity suite for quick, secure communications between each other. The new features introduced to iMessage by iOS 10 and above are causing some eminteresting/em problems.  Is it possible to disable Reactions in iMessage so that inadvertent love hearts, etc are sent by those with the occasional sausage finger?  <answer270329> You can disable or "reduce" motion throughout iOS. Disadvantage: Not only iMessage will deactivate special effects, but strongApps will also open in a "not so flashy" way./strong  To try it out:     ol   liOpen Settings./li   liTap on General./li   liTap on Accessibility./li   liTap on Reduce Motion./li   liTap the switch on the right side of Reduce Motion to turn it on and disable iMessage effects in the Messages app on your iPhone, iPad, or   iPod./li   /ol   <comment339704> Thank you @gruberb. Will this disable the sending of Reactions or only the receiving of them? <comment339749> The reaction will be deactivated then, but be sure and test it)
