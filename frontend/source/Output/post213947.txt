iPad Mini 2 Screen Very Touchy <body> With both of my iPad's, one a mutilated iPad 2, and this one an iPad mini 2, I have been having issues with the screen.  What happens? Randomly, once every randomly, the screen will start detecting random touches, either multitouching with a single touch, or single touching with no touch. Usually, a reboot fixes it until next time.  Same thing here, only, I get 5 minutes usage tops before issues arise, and it starts throwing a party, making it unusable.  I am currently in the middle of coding an app for iPad on my iPad, so I can't afford to lose it again. I also can't risk coding for fear taunt deletion or code corruption because of this issue.  This is exactly what led to my iPad 2's demise 2 years ago.  What could be causing this? Is there an easy, or even a fix at all?  Thanks!  Things I've tried:  precodeRemove all non-stock Cydia .DEB's; Clean screen; Let rest; Feed to cat. /code/pre  Extra info:  precodeiOS 8.4; Jailbroken; Last Cydia .DEB installed 7 days ago; Issue rampant yesterday on; Not plugged in; No System touch-system file changes. /code/pre  <comment258262> Is the device plugged into a charger at the time? I've noticed bad touch sensitivity when attached to cheap chargers & also on real Apple chargers when using step-up transformers [inverters]. <comment258266> @Tetsujin "`Not plugged in;`" <comment258267> OK, then I'm outside my comfort zone - best advice would be, restore it to a non-jailbroken state, update to 9.1, test. Re-apply jailbreak if OK, test again. <comment258277> @Tetsujin Here's the issue. 9.1 is non jailbreakable and 9.0 is not being signed. Not to mention the lack of iOS 9 cydia support.. <comment260477> Are you using any smart covers? <comment260493> Nothing. Bare screen. Not within 50' of liquid or an open electrical current. <comment261366> Might be a hardware issue. Check with Apple Store! <comment261528> I have same issue. Reloaded iOS, factory reset, still messing up. Called Apple support. Firstly out of warranty! Apple said hardware fault, send it back for repair, €200 please! New one is €300, kinda thinking why bother with Apple if I only get 2years out of it. No physical damage, never dropped, one careful owner! Very annoyed. Apple reseller looking at me as if I have two heads when explaining problem (as it is intermittent). <comment261775> @Leeser Every device is dead in 2 years.Just like humans, they are programmed to die. <comment261787> @Thecheater887 "Designed obsolescence" is the term I think! Yeah, it's really indicative of our disposable lifestyle (being pessimistic) or indicative of the advances in technology ( being an optimist) that after 2 years it's out of date! It's almost like the line from "Bladerunner" "Wake up it's time to die"... <comment262366> Brought iPad mini back to reseller again, sales guy was able to grow facial hair and was more knowledgeable than previous sales boy. He recognised the problem and packed iPad off for repair under European consumer warranty, (6 years from date of purchase) last Thursday. Today picked up replacement free of charge! Cool.
