Email address coming up with caller ID <body> How is my contact able to see my email address instead of my name in their contacts list? My friend says my email address shows on the caller ID instead of the name she has for me in her contacts list.  <comment190736> is that a iPhone? with ios 8? <comment190750> It's impossible to know without looking at what she has in her contacts.  FWIW tho, if it's an iPhone and she has facebook and twitter installed it wouldn't suprise me that the phone put 1 and 1 together to get 4
