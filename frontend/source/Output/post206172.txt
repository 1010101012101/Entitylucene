DVD Drive on 2007 MacBook Pro Not Working in Yoseminite <body> My 2007 17-inch MacBook Pro Duo is running Yosemite (I checked before I installed it, and it says Yosemite will work on it). Everything has been doing fine until I tried to use the DVD drive today. It won't recognize a DVD in the DVD drive. I checked the sidebar and the recognize CDs, DVDs, and iPods is checked. Can someone tell me what to do so I can use my DVD drive and have the DVDs and CDs be recognized on the desktop.  <comment248637> Maybe is more a hardware than a software problem. Did you try with different DVD discs? Did you try the discs in other computers? <comment248842> Yes I did and nothing worked. I also tried a USB thumb drive and it didn't show up either. Both showed up om my 2013 iMac. Thanks for trying to help! <comment248846> if you run Disk Utility, does the drive show up there? Or look in "About this Mac" in the Apple Menu? <comment249062> No, it doesn't show up in Disk Utility. I put in a blank disc that will usually show up as untitled 1 (and does in my desktop mac), but it doesn't show up in disk utility so I can format it. I checked the sidebar menu and showing CDs, DVDs, and iPods is checked. I had not checked About This Mac. The Super Drive does show up in storage. Is there something else I should be checking under About This Mac? Again, thanks for your help! <comment249157> You could run a system report from About This Mac to see whether the drive gets listed.
