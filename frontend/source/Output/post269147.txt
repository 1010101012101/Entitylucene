How swap/rearrange Spaces Bar between displays? <body> So, I finish work, disconnect my display and reconnect them later. The display positionings are correct but macOS has somehow swapped the Space bar between the two external displays.  To elaborate. A, B and C are displays. A is positioned to the left, B center and C right. Before disconnecting and reconnecting spaces X, Y and Z were in A, L, M and N in B, and Q, R and S in C. After reconnecting the spaces/spaces bar in A got swapped with that of C. The positioning of the screens are correct.  So, how can I swap the spaces bar to between displays? It happened once before and I had to manually rearrange the spaces, but it is quite inconvenient.
