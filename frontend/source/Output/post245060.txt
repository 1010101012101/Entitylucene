How to connect a YPG-625 keyboard to a modern Mac <body> I'm trying to connect Yamaha's YPG-625 musical keyboard to a Mac, but it seems like there are only USB-MIDI drivers for Mac OS 10.1.5-10.4.0. Is there a way to connect it to a system with OS X El Capitan?  <answer245065> After some searching, I found out that, even though the keyboard page doesn't point to these drivers, the generic USB-MIDI drivers from Yamaha work.
