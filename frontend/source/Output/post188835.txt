One weather widget is completely wrong, showing that it is night time all the time <body> I use the weather widget on my MacBook Air dashboard to watch many cities current weather. I have opened multiple incidences of this widget, one for each city so each city's weather is displayed individually. I can see the weather for each of these cities at a glance. The weather widget is set to turn the background of the displayed weather blue for day and purple for night. One city's background does not change color- it stays purple all day and all night. This village is actually going into 24 daylight now and the background should be blue for at least 22 hours but it stays purple, indicating night, non-stop.  The other cities' widgets backgrounds accurately reflect night or day so this does not appear to be a setting on my computer.  I am puzzled as to why one city's widget appears to be 'stuck' on night.    Can I somehow un-stick it or point it to a more reliable data source if that is the culprit? Suggestions on workarounds or how to debug this are welcome.  I have a Macbook Air, 10.8.5.
