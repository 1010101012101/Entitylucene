App that allows to paste text snippets in any applicaton? <body> I'm looking for an OS X application that will allow me to add text snippets, like common text responses to emails or signature postings or whatever standard text phrases I wish to save and resuse.  Something that perhaps runs in the background on the toolbar that allows me to select phrases and insert them when needed.  <answer119380> The perfect tool for this job is TextExpander - it allows you to insert snippets from a menu or using a shortcut such as ";;snippet". It is incredibly powerful and is high on my recommended list.  It's $35 but there is a free trial.  <answer119382> Take a look at Snippets http://www.snippetsapp.com  or CodeBox http://www.shpakovski.com/codebox/  or Dash http://kapeli.com/dash  or Clips http://clipsapp.com  or Clipmenu http://www.clipmenu.com  i used Clips for the last 2-3 years  <answer119405> Alfred with the PowerPack also lets you define snippets which are easily pasted anywhere. TextExpander as Tony Williams mentioned is a bit more convenient, but Alfred is cheaper and can do a lot more than just expanding snippets.   <answer119422> there is a built in function in iOS and keyboard settings for Mac that offers shortcuts enter a shortcut and the phrase it expands into when you type the shortcut and a space afterwards.  it doesn't allow for line-breaks however  <answer119427> I, personally, like the freeware XMenu from Devon Technologies:  http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/freeware.html  You define snippets by making a text clipping and placing them in a particular folder. The clippings menu resides in your menu bar.  It's also got a nice launcher a'la NowMenu. And as it is an App it doesn't modify the system and cause incompatibility issues like some other clippings apps do.  <comment139243> +1 for Snippets. It's very cool and I use it a lot. <comment139254> Perfect! Thanks
