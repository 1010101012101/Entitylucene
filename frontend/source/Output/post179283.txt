CLI options do not work if passed at the end of command <body> In brief: codels -a /tmp/code works but codels /tmp -a/code does not.  I recently started using Macbook Pro. Coming from a Linux background, command like codels /tmp -a/code seems perfectly fine to me.   But for some reason these do not work in the same fashion in Mac. Argument flags are not recognised if they are specified at the end after the path.   Here is a demo:  precode/tmp/demo  ➜ ls -a ./ .           ..          .hidden-bar foo /tmp/demo  ➜ ls ./ -a ls: -a: No such file or directory ./: foo /tmp/demo  ➜      /code/pre  I am using latest codezsh 5.0.5 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0)/code  I can see similar behaviour of several other commands like codedu/code, coderm/code etc. Almost all such are in /bin folder. I wonder if it has something to do with UNIX and Linux differences.  Does anybody know the reason behind the difference and if possible a fix for it?  <answer179290> This is because apple codezsh/code shell version. To install codezsh/code version with that behaviour, you have to install homebrew. You can easily to it by typing the following:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Once installed, install the codezsh/code formulae:  precodebrew install zsh /code/pre  Then you have to replace your shell with codezsh/code provided by homebrew:  precodechsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh /code/pre  After that you should be able to test your codezsh/code version and use command arguments like you want.  <comment212486> Your original question/statement mentions *arguments* but you're actually asking about placing *options* at the end of a command line ;-) <comment212487> OSX was spawned off of, I think, FreeBSD, while Linux uses GNU tools. I'm surprised that GNU tools allow options to follow arguments. I'd recommend you retrain your brain and get used to the BSD fashion. <comment212752> That is what I used in the first place. I digged a little deeper for you - they also use zsh.org for downloads. See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/78e9ae8c49ed74f17433d5aab10c2f8949c1392b/Library/Formula/zsh.rb#L6
