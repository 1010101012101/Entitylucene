Media keys behaving like function keys <body> I'm experiencing some frustrating keyboard issues on my new 2014 Macbook Air (OS X 10.9.3)  When using the laptop keyboard, the F1â€“12 keys take the behavior of "function" as opposed to the "media key" behavior they should have by default (brightness, volume, etc).  I've unchecked the "Use all F1-F12 keys as standard function keys" setting in System Preferences. I've also tried a few things in the terminal:  ul licodedefaults write "Apple Global Domain" "com.apple.keyboard.fnState" "0"/code (referenced here)/li licodedefaults write -g com.apple.keyboard.fnState -bool true/code (referenced here)/li /ul  I restart after each of these and still nothing.  -  A couple things to note:  ul liWhen I connect an Apple Keyboard, the keys on the Apple Keyboard work as normal./li liI recently connected a Kinesis Freestyle 2 keyboard to the laptop. I have a feeling this may have caused the issue, possibly because it was a Windows version of the keyboard as opposed to a Mac version (Oh Windows, always causing trouble...)/li /ul  Any ideas? Thanks.  <answer134761> Ugh. I hate when the solution is "it just stopped happening all of a sudden"... but a firmware update came out and I installed it, and now my keys back! Yay =D  If I learn anything about what exactly happened here I'll post my findings.  <answer135177> precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "keyboardTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.keyboard" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     click checkbox 1 of tab group 1 of window 1 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  I have also found one quick fix from here  <comment159593> If you boot to another disk or to the recovery partition do the keys behave as expected? <comment160229> Dude you lost 100 rep on that issue :( I vote you up.
