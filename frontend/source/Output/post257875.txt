Repeatedly prompted to activate siri and iTunes opens -- possibly Kinesis related <body> About once per minute, my computer asks me whether I want to activate Siri as in this other question. Per that question, I have enabled Siri then dis-enable it from system preferences -- did not fix my problem  At the same time, iTunes opens.  It just started about ten minutes ago when I plugged in my Kinesis Advantage Pro keyboard. Are these related and how can I stop Siri popping up continually after toggling the preference?  <comment326865> In my case, I have deleted iTunes, and it magically reinstalls it each time the prompt pops ... Thinking about downgrading this shit
