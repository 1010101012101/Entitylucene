Starting Preview without opening previous PostScript documents <body> I'm running the latest version of OS X and Preview is hanging whenever I try to start it.  It attempts to open the documents which I previously had open, which is ~10 PDFs and ~3 PostScript files, and it seems to be permanently get stuck whilst "converting" those PostScript files (even though opening them was no issue before).  Hence my question is, how do I start Preview without opening those documents? (I'm guessing there's some kind of cache I should delete.)  <answer163804> Do you want to disable the App re-open the documents when you launch the App? So, you can go to "System Preferences"  "General" and enable the "close windows when quitting and app" option.  <answer175416> To amplify what Nelson said above, here are the full list of steps which worked for me on OSX 10.10.2:  Quit Preview if it’s running.  Hold down the option key and select Go ▹ Library from the Finder menu bar. From the Library folder, delete the following items, if they exist:  precode      Containers/com.apple.Preview        Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist        Preferences/com.apple.Preview.SandboxedPersistentURLs.LSSharedFileList.plist        Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState /code/pre  Log out and log back in. Launch the application and test.

Then Quit the app.  I have several windows/documents (in textedit) that I leave open when I quit, so they will open when I reopen the app, it works with most OSX 10.10 apps. I use them as a sort of note pad, NOTE: if the system crashes you could loose the data if they have not been saved at some time.  <answer224908> This worked for a colleague: you can type kbdalt/opt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdW/kbd when opening Preview, then quit an re-open.  <answer282424> You can do a Finder search for codecom.apple.preview/code and find the files you need to remove:   From Terminal, you can go tobr           code~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/com.apple.Preview.savedState//code  There you can remove the codewindow_*.data/code files that include your previously open file list.  You can also remove codewindows.plist/code and that gets rid of all of them.  <comment191828> That has always been enabled, I guess Preview ignores that (in the case of a crash, at least). <comment191830> you can check the "Saved state", goto the "~/Saved Application State/com.apple.Preview.savedState" directory and check <comment191941> That seems to have worked, thanks!
