Share Photos album on Dropbox <body> Is there a way to share a Photos album (regular or 'smart') via Dropbox?  I know that I can emcopy/em the album to DB, but I'd rather create a symlink (or similar) so the photographs aren't duplicated on my HDD.  <answer250363> I recently tried to "Create Alias" for a photo folder, and then put the Alias in Dropbox. Then I went to dropbox.com to see if I could view the folder's contents. The folder is there, but the photos inside could not be viewed. This is the error message I got.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wtnfX.png" alt="Create Alias Doesn&#39;t Work"  When I clicked on "Open" it opened the Dropbox folder on my computer. This would not help me if I were away from my computer and using the web to access my files.  I did come across an app in the Mac App Store called, "Cloud Storage Helper." It bugs me that I don't understand how this app works (and maybe someone else on here does!), but I was able to create links from my computer into my cloud storage and access them online.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2JUA.png" alt="Cloud Storage Helper"   <comment310835> It might use a [symbolic link](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2001110610290643), rather than an alias.
