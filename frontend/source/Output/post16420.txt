How do I uninstall Xcode? <body> I now have two versions of Xcode installed:  ul liXcode 4 - installed in /Developer (bought from Mac App Store)/li liXcode 3 - installed in /Developer-old (I believe it was installed from the second disc supplied with my MCB)/li /ul  Since I don't use either of those at the moment, how can I completely remove both?br Would removing both folder just do the job?br What about associated Library stuff?  <answer16421> Xcode comes with an uninstaller. Just run  precodesudo &lt;Xcode directory&gt;/Library/uninstall-devtools --mode=all /code/pre  <comment17930> Thanks. There were a few leftovers (sym-links) after that. A little bit more left after uninstalling /Developer-old but since the uninstaller completed its job I removed those manually. <comment18377> The readme for the perl script mentions that it leaves a few directories and how to delete them. You did the right thing to clean them up.
