Index of files to backup <body> I'm looking for something similar to http://www.indexyourfiles.com/ for the mac.  What I want to do is create a backup of my file index which is portable and can be searched through even if you don't have actual access to the files.  Any clues?  Br  <answer97043> A quick search of "disk catalogs" on MacUpdate revealed some of the apps that used to be much more common. NeoFinder (formerly CDFinder) and Disk Catalog Maker  were well-rated. A search of the Mac App Store would I'm sure turn up more, though they all seem to have become more expensive.
