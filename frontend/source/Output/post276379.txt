Can't watch and download video from iTunes <body> I am experiencing a problem while trying to watch an iOS development course in iTunes on macOS. You can find the course here:  https://itunes.apple.com/ru/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120?l=en  If I try to click the play button and watch videos 1 to 6, iTunes just does nothing. It seems to ignore my action. If I try to download the videos, it looks like they are downloading, but they turn out to have formatting problems.   Here is a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6lyKl.png" alt="enter image description here"   If I try to open this video I get this message:  precodeThe movie could not be opened. An invalid public movie atom was found in the movie. /code/pre  or this:  precodeThe movie could not be opened. The file is not a movie file. /code/pre  But interestingly, if I try watch online or download video from the 6th one to the last one they work properly. I can watch them as well as download them.  What is the issue here? What am I doing wrong?  If I skip something feel free to ask  <answer276413> If someone will looking for the resources that I looked for, so there is a link to youtube channel  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdOYqsUTqTRetMWwuUBxxg  <answer276812> I had this exact problem with the Stanford iOS 10 course on iTunes for Mac. I eventually gave up and downloaded the videos on iTunes for Windows.  However, I more recently fixed the problem by reinstalling macOS. You can do this by holding kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd on startup, clicking on "Reinstall macOS" or "Reinstall OS X", and following the prompts.  Note that this will strongnot/strong destroy any of your files or programs. It simply reinstalls the system applications, but any settings, files, or applications that you have on your computer should not be changed.  (You may consider making a backup first.)  <comment347871> This looks like a link to a copy of the Stanford courses you were trying to watch.  It doesn't appear to resolve your problem, though, so is really an answer?  Also, these courses are copyrighted by Stanford so I doubt they'll stay on youtube for much longer. <comment347896> Please don't add comments in the _Answer_ field as this is for answers to questions.
