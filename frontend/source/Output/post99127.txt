Free windows tiling manager (similar to ShiftIt or divvy) that can be installed without admin privileges <body> I usually use ShiftIt to manage, tile, and resize windows. I have come to the point where I really depend on it.  I'm looking for an alternative. It needs to be free, and it needs to be able to be installed and used on OS X 10.7.5 without admin privileges.  What are ways you would recommend to easily tile windows in OS X?  <answer99142> I use scripts like these:  precodetry     tell application "Finder"         set b to bounds of window of desktop     end tell     set item 1 of b to ((item 3 of b) / 2)     set item 2 of b to 22     tell application (path to frontmost application as text)         set bounds of window 1 to b     end tell end try /code/pre    precodetry     tell application "Finder" to set b to bounds of window of desktop     set item 2 of b to 22     tell application (path to frontmost application as text)         set bounds of window 1 to b     end tell on error     try         tell application "System Events" to tell (process 1 where it is frontmost)             click (button 1 of window 1 where subrole is "AXZoomButton")         end tell     end try end try /code/pre  They don't require access for assistive devices to be enabled (other than for the codeon error/code block in the second script). They don't work with all windows though, and I don't know what will happen if you have multiple displays.  Automator services are supported out of the box and you can create them on a non-admin account, but as of 10.8 there is a bug where the keyboard shortcuts for Automator services don't always work until you hover over the services menu from the menu bar. There is also a relatively long delay before Automator services are run.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbcob.jpg" alt=""  See this answer for other ways to assign shortcuts to scripts. I use FastScripts, which is free for up to 10 keyboard shortcuts and doesn't require administrator privileges.  <comment116508> Could you provide a link for *shift*? I know *divvy* but quick googling doesn't show anything named *shift* in relation to window resizing. <comment116510> There are so many options for this, that you cannot define "best", just "preferred" which is opinion based not empirical.  I "prefer" Moom. <comment116519> @rsanchezsaez. I included a link <comment116523> @DavidWest Thanks, got it now. I don't think there are many options that would not need admin privileges. If you want to provide a good UX I suspect this kind of windows manager would need admin privileges. <comment116539> I stand corrected, the answer by Lauri looks like a nice and feasible workaround.
