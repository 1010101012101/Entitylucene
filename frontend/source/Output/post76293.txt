Facebook messages causing the Facebook app on my iPad to crash <body> I have an iPad mini, updated to iOS 6. I can use my Facebook app well in every department apart from messages. In both the top display and side display, when I click on the messages option the Facebook app will crash. I have tried uninstalling the app, restarting, installing and restarting, but nothing improves or changes. Also I have tried the proper restart by holding down both the top lock/unlock button and home button but that has not worked either.   Is there anything else I can do to fix this crashing problem?  <answer76651> It's not clear if this is a bug that needs to be fixed with a new release of e program, but you could follow this path and try reinstalling the older version of the app from a computer and or computer backup.  What can we do now that Facebook iPad app crashes on launch after update?
