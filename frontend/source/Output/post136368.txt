Suddenly lost all contacts and calendar entries <body> My iPhone just lost all of my contacts and calendar entries, except for 5 contacts that I haven't used in years and actually deleted a few months ago.  It also lost my saved player info for at least one game (Infinity Blade II).  I didn't change anything or do anything to my phone; it just suddenly doesn't have any of this information.  I still have all my apps, most of which seem to be fine, and I still have my recent calls information, but there are no names associated with the numbers.  What could have caused this and how can I get everything back?  strongEDIT:/strong I tried restarting my phone. That didn't seem to help. But, here it is, 15 minutes later, and almost everything is back. I'm still missing a couple of contacts and my game profile.  strongEDIT 2:/strong What I would still like to figure out is strongemwhat happened/em/strong. The answers are all focused on backup &amp; restore options. None of them addresses what might have gone wrong or how I can prevent this from happening again in the future, which is the real point of this question.  <answer136370> Recommend you do this  iOS: Back up and restore your iOS device with iCloud or iTunes  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1766  Here is also very nice step by step.  <answer145811> i just backed up manually and everything came back..  <comment161778> are you syncing ? <comment161779> No. I wasn't doing anything. <comment161780> Do you use iCloud ? <comment161781> Yes. My phone prompted me to sign into iCloud a few minutes before this happened. I hit cancel, although it still says I'm signed in. <comment161782> ......................... :) <comment161785> I'm hesitant to do a restore when (1) I don't know what happened, (2) almost everything seems to be back, and (3) I'm not confident my phone has actually been backing up correctly. <comment171859> This answer doesn't provide enough details -- you'll find it's going to attract a lot of downvotes as a result. How did you back up manually? Do you really mean "backed up" or do you mean "restored from a previous backup"?
