VMWare Tools do not allow changing resolution in El Capitan <body> Looks like VMWare Tools do not allow changing resolution in El Capitan. Input data as follows:  ul liVMWare Workstation 12/li liLatest VMWare Tools 8.0.2 (here) /li liMac OS El Capitan, build 15B42/li /ul  I've tried everything I could find online. I set codesudo nvram boot-args=rootless=0/code before installation. I also disabled protection via codecsrutil disable/code in Recovery.  VMWare says it's installed successfully. I see that its drivers are loading in verbose boot log.  precodeNov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: Loaded com.vmware.kext.VMwareGfx Version 0297.78.63 Build 2977863 (Aug 11 2015 19:19:22) Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: svga: Start: FB size=0x300000, FIFO size=0x200000 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: svga: Start: host_bpp=32, bpp=32, num_displays=2 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: fb: start: maxWidth 3840 maxHeight 1920 vramSize 33554432 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: fb: setDisplayMode: (1) wxh=1024x768, 32 4096 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: svga: SetMode: mode w,h=1024, 768 bpp=32 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: svga: SetMode: pitch=4096 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: fb: setDisplayMode: Display ID=1, Depth ID=0 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: fb: setDisplayMode: wxh=1024x768, bpp=32, pitch=4096 Nov  5 13:51:38 localhost kernel[0]: gfx: gfx: UpdateTraces: Enabling traces.

Suspiciously despite the fact that codecsrutil status/code says codedisabled/code in Recovery in real system it gives following result  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tKjk5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any thoughts how to make it work?   <comment258981> The `rootless=0` was for 10.11 beta only. I suggest you erase your NVRAM completely and then disable it properly in Recovery HD. <comment258983> @IronCraftMan How do I erase it ? If it's `csrutil clear` then I tried that :( Also it seems vmware gfs kext is launched properly. I wonder why it's not reflected in System Settings / Display. <comment258985> VMware does not support running OS X under VMware Workstation and doing so also violates Apple's SLA for OS X.
