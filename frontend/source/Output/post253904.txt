(They still switch focus to Chrome.)  According to this answer, the file that needs to be edited is code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code.

(I am running Mac OS 10.7.4.)  <answer253905> In the General pane of Mail settings, there should be an option for setting the default mail client.  <comment316066> While you definitely answer the question, providing more information (such as what the setting is called or a screenshot) would flesh out your post. <comment316067> I wouldn't suggest mucking with LaunchServices unless you know exactly what you're doing. Also, `mailto` is a protocol already handled by the system. The question you linked was about defining new protocols. <comment316070> D'oh!  I didn't think to check *there*.  Of course, Apple.  Why wouldn't a system-wide default be set from a single application's preferences pane?  Makes perfect sense.  (@tubedogg, that really is all the info needed to find the setting.)
