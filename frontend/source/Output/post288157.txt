Cydia Unable to Load (server certificate invalid) <body> I just jailbroke my ipod touch 2g, but I can't get Cydia to open anything, it throws an error:      Unable to Load    (The certificate for this server is invalid. You might be connecting to a server that is pretending to be "cydia.saurik.com" which could put your confidential information at risk.)   A quick google search told me that the date/time is wrong and that usually fixes the problem for everybody, but it doesn't work for me! :( I've restarted it a few times, and tried changing the date/time, but nothing helps. I also tried re-setting the network settings, but no go.   I think Cydia needs updated to the latest version, but I'm not sure how to do that, if it won't load in the first place...
