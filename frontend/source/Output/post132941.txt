VPN to OSX from windows machine? <body> The environment i have setup consists of an OSX Server, running file sharing and VPN.   The file share is accessible from the local network on both windows or OSX machines, and OSX machines have no problem connecting to the server via VPN when on a remote network.   However, i can't seem be to able to set the VPN/File share up via a windows machine that is not on the local network, can anyone advise further as to how I would allow windows machines to connect to the osx servers file share/vpn from a remote network?   Thanks!  <answer132950> ol liAdd this to your registry: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\PolicyAgent] "AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule"=dword:00000002/li liOpen secpol.msc (click start  search for secpol.msc)  ul liLocal Policies  Security Options/li liNetwork Security : LAN Manager Auth Level…/li liSet to: Send LM &amp; NTLMv2 - UseNTLMv2…/li /ul/li /ol  And  ul liNetwork Security : Minimum session security… clients/li liuncheck "Require 128-bit encryption"  ol liRestart PC/li liCreate VPN Connection on Windows 7/li /ol/li liHost Name: (server IP or yourhost.name.com)/li liPPP Settings : Enable LCP (only)/li liType: L2TP/IPSec/li liPre-shared key : yoursharedsecret/li liData encryption : Optional encryption/li liAllow CHAO and CHAPv2  ol liRouter on server-side must allow VPN Passthrough and forward ports: 50, 51, 500, 548, 1701, 1723, 4500 to the server box.

Just to clarify, the Reservation and Port forwarding has been set up - and OSX can connect via VPN perfectly from outside the local network - It's just windows machines I'm having trouble with <comment157433> Ah, Apologies. The router that's being used is:  TP-Link 150M Model: TL-WR740N / TL-WR740ND Unfortunately we're stuck with this router as it's tied with our Service Provider
