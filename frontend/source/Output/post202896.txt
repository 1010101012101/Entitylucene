File modify date is not updated in Finder file properties <body> I have a video capture of a strange behavior:  File prior to editing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bj2pG.png" alt="pre"  Edited at 5:15PM using TextEdit  In Finder I see the file with strange rename, and Modified date value is not updated, nor does the length (at least a few bytes should have been added).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WzH3l.png" alt="post"  What is the cause of this behavior?  Unfortunately, since I only have a video capture and the issue does not reproduce, I don't know if the file changed back to its normal codetxt/code form. But it does not seem to change for as long as the video run.  Sorry for the ambiguity, I'm working on getting a more accurate reproduction.  <answer202989> The strange edited file name is due to it currently saving a temporary file. Did you quit TextEdit after you edited the file?  <comment244730> Important to mention, this is OSX 10.11 Developers Beta <comment244824> I did quit it. Though it makes sense the OS could take its time to write to the file under some circumstances. I guess..
