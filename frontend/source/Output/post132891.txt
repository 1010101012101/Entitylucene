My computer has no admin user <body> In system preferences, under users, standard is written under my name and there is no admin.  When i try to change preferences it asks for admin name and password to unlock it but my login password doesn't work as I'm not an admin.  <answer132913> Boot into single user mode.  Delete the file code/var/db/.AppleSetupDone/code and then codetype exit/code and press return  At that point, the system will boot back to the normal setup process (keeping your old users intact) You will be guided through the steps to create a new admin user so pick a short name that doesn't exist on the Mac and you can then re-grant your normal user admin rights if you wish.  <answer132928> One could also try:  codedseditgroup -o edit -a shortnamehere -t user admin/code  But you would likely have to boot into single user mode as mentioned before because I'm pretty sure you can't do it without being root first.  <comment157404> Does `dseditgroup` even work in single user mode these days? <comment272846> Great answer just for fun run a backup first -- just out of paranoia :)
