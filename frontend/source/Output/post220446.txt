Using Apple's Screen Sharing, can I redirect gestures and keys for controlling Spaces to the shared machine? <body> I'm using the built in Screen Sharing tool in El Capitan to control an iMac from a Macbook Pro in full screen mode. Everything works beautifully except that many special keys and gestures are intercepted by the local Mac and not sent to the shared Mac. Specifically:  ul liCtrl-Arrow (Desktops and Mission Control)/li liF3 (Mission Control)/li liF4 (LaunchPad)/li liThree finger swipe (Switch between Desktops, Mission Control, Exposé)/li liTwo finger swipe from left side (Notification Center)/li liPinch with four fingers (Launchpad)/li /ul  I can't find any way to switch between desktops on the remote machine other than manually opening the Mission Control app from the Finder or Dock. Disabling the gestures on the local machine doesn't help; they still don't get sent to the remote machine.  Is there any way to get special keys and gestures passed to the shared machine?  <answer220450> Not truly a fix, but a possible workaround.  This picture has the remote key assignments to the left, &amp; mine to the right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N9cqK.png" alt="enter image description here"  By avoiding the same keys for Mission Control itself, I can get to the remote machine's 'screen list' by using kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd ↑ /kbd at least &amp; click on the one I require.  It's not neat, but it does function.  <answer238299> Apple's Screen Sharing has very limited ability to intercept the shortcuts and direct them to the remote OS. About the best you can do is place the screen sharing window in full screen and then shortcuts like quit and spotlight will at least go to the remote as opposed to the local OS.  You might want to look at other software if you run remote sessions:  ul liApple Remote Desktop - still Apple software but provides a little more automation/li liScreens app - has a nice toolbar with commonly needed commands to send spaces / mission control / other affordances to the remote OS/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXBrM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment266808> I let all remote users'  screens have Ctrl/up arrow for spaces & mine is on F4… just so I can get to them. If you use "your" commands, your machine changes space instead :( <comment266810> @Tetsujin How do you manage that? Ctrl-Arrow and all the F keys do not seem to get passed to the remote machine for me, whether they are assigned on the local machine or not. <comment266814> I'll throw my keyboard setup into an answer… which isn't really an answer, but I manage to get by with it... <comment304539> Any idea what's Apple's direction with [Apple Remote Desktop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-remote-desktop/id409907375).
