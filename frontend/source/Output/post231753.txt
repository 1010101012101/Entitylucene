iCloud "message size violation" when sending zip containing more than 127 files <body> h2Revised question/h2  As per Tetsujin's suggestion in the comments I did some further testing.  There seems to be a problem with iCloud and sending a zip file of a folder with a certain amount of files. There appears to be a limit of 127 files in 1 folder, regardless of file type (tried code.png/code, code.svg/code and code.txt/code).  When sending the mail using the Mail app I get a codemessage size violation/code error and the mail can not be sent. Using the iCloud web interface the mail does appear to be sent (no error, appears in 'emsent/em' list) but it never arrives.  Does anyone know why this limit exists? (as Tetsujin mentioned in the comments it might be some 7-bit shenanigans)  hr  h2Old question/h2  If I try to send an email with a 1.3 MB zip file as attachment I get a codemessage size violation/code error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbZXF.png" width="617" height="600" alt="Mail error" title="Mail error"  File sizes of the zip file and original folder (1.3 MB and 10.7 MB respectively):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cBFGb.png" alt="Info panel zip file and folder"   At first I thought it was somehow related the original folder being more than 10 MB, but according to Apple's iCloud support page the limit is 20 MB:     h2Limits on sending messages/h2      There are several safeguards in place to make sure that only iCloud members can send messages using iCloud. One of these safeguards includes reasonable limits on:      ul   li.../li   liThe size of incoming and outgoing messages (20 MB, up to 5 GB with Mail Drop turned on)/li   /ul   Why am I unable to send this zip file? (also: shouldn't Mail Drop kick in if it thinks the attachment is too large? It is turned on.)  <answer256148> I just ran into the same problem : zipped two 11.5 MB Xojo compiled apps. Sending from me.com or sending to me.com gave the 'message size violation' error.   To bypass this possible 127-file limit, I created an empty disk image with Disk Utility. Mounted it and copied the two apps onto it. Unmounted and zipped it and sent it via me.com : that worked.  <comment283032> I'd first just suspect 'glitch'. Try a new mail with the same attachment, & a new mail with a re-zipped version. That will eliminate a couple of options. <comment283036> Sending a new mail, using a different iCloud address, restarting Mail nor rezipping the folder worked unfortunately. <comment283038> Does it send if there's no attachment at all, or a different attachment entirely? <comment283044> Okay I did some testing: the problem seems to be the number of files in 1 folder. The limit is 127 files in a zipped folder. The moment I add 1 more file the zip doesn't send. (regardless of file type, I tested using PNG's SVG's and TXT files) <comment283046> Ahh, right. Useful info. I had no idea there was a limit... nor how the mailer would be able to tell <comment283048> I'd be tempted to revise the question, as we now know 'how' yet not 'why' <comment283050> Good suggestion, I revised the question. I might check if Gmail is able to handle zip files with more than 127 files. <comment283051> It's a prime example of some kind of 7-bit addressing system, though why it should be so limited in this day & age is anyone's guess
