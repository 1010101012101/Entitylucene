How can I adjust the music in imovie for part of a movie? <body> I have a imovie project that I am creating and I have video clips and an audio track which plays a song.  I see that I can adjust the volume level of the song for the whole song but I want to lower the volume for part of the song (because I want to emphasize the audio coming from the video clip)  Is it possible to adjust the volume of a music track for part of the song in imovie?  <answer137016> ol likbd‚å• alt/option/kbd-click on the volume adjustment to create new keyframes/li liAdjust the volume between these keyframes by dragging./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HklRa.gif" alt=""  <comment162689> in step one, what is before the "click" text? <comment162690> @leora It's the symbol for the alt/option key <comment162691> ok . . perfect  . . thanks for the response <comment162750> Brilliant!
