Any GUI for GDB on Mac? <body> I have already used GDB on Linux before and i know Xcode has a debugger tool. But i want to ask you guys, Â¿there is some GUI for GDB at OSX, just like KDBG on Linux?.  I was searching at brew (KDBG) with no luck.  Thanks in advance, i keep searching :3  <comment150055> Xcode is a GUI for GDB and a very good one at that. What's wrong with it that made you look for something else? Not just a rhetorical question but a practical one -- if you don't refine your requirements, no one will be able to help you. <comment150060> Yey you are right, well i was looking only a debugger without the editor because i am using text mate. So o will try with Xcode after all. Thanks swineone? xD nice name :)
