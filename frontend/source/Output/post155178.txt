iMovie does not import audio with video <body> I've created four separate videos (screencasts) using Open Broadcaster Software v.637b on Windows 8.1 and did a voiceover as I was recording the video. I can open each video in VLC and the audio plays without issue. OBS encodes the video as x264 (.mp4) and the video as AAC.  I copy the videos to my Macbook Pro (Yosemite) to splice in iMovie (v10.0.6) and two of the videos will not play audio (iMovie shows the audio track as empty - a straight line as if no audio is present) and the other two videos play the audio. In all instances, playing the video in VLC plays audio.   I have Google'd and searched but cannot find anything and I'm really at wits end. Any idea what is going on? What can I do so that iMovie reads the audio track for the videos?  edit: QuickTime on OS X does not play audio for the same videos that iMovie does not import audio.  <comment182567> I'd try to reencode it with HandBrake and see if that fixes whatever it is that QuickTime can not handle. <comment182614> @root I tried that and it worked but then iMovie gave me an error when exporting and I don't know if that had anything to do with the export error. I gave up with OBS/iMovie as I don't think they are made for each other. I'm using a trial of Camtasia Studio and it's working great.
