Is microphone quality different for iPhones and iPads? <body> Should there be any significant difference in quality between the iPad Pro 10.5 and iPhone 7 Plus, with respect to internal microphone quality?  My iPad Pro seemed subjectively worse at dictation, so I setup a quick test:  ul liRemoved cases from devices, ensured clear path to microphones/li liRecorded a .wav sample to playback to the two devices, to test dictation, so the input wouldn't change. /li liHeld bothe devices microphones about three inches away from the test speaker./li /ul  The iPad Pro has been consistently worse in these tests, even though it also has a dual mic setup. I speak pretty neutrally, without an accent.  Is it expected that iPad should be worse?  Any ideas to explain the difference?
