Delete a Ubuntu partition and restore the OSX partition <body> I am getting tired of this now. I have tried a lot of different suggestion on various forums but i still can not remove the old Ubuntu partition. I installed this using EFI.  What i want to do it delete Linux Filesystem, Microsoft Basic Data (one of many tries by changing format to remove it) and the EFI. After that i want to merge the disk into my normal Macintosh HD.  Both the Linux and Microsoft basic drive does not have a "-" sign to delete them, see the picture below.  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Bm0H.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YImef.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
