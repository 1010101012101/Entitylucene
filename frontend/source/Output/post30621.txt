How do I reset Apple's Mail, in Lion, to default settings? <body> I have been having a bunch of email problems and want to start over.  I have deleted all the IMAP accounts from Mail.  What other files do I need to delete, hidden and otherwise, to make Mail (and only Mail) just like a clean install?  <answer30623> The following directories should be empty:  ul licode~/Library/Mail/code/li licode~/Library/Mail Downloads/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Mail/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/Mail/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/com.apple.mail/code/li /ul  The following files should be removed:  ul licode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist*/code/li licode~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.mail.savedState/code/li /ul  <answer119277> In addition to the folders mentioned by Patrix, I discovered that Apple Mail (at least the OS X 10.9 Mavericks version) is using another folder, at:  ...../Library/Containers/com.apple.mail  After I had tried to do a clean restart of Mail by disabling (re-naming) all the folders that I thought that it was using (and having done a Force-Quit of the process "cfprefsd" in my username, to further reset caches), my Mail froze on trying to start up.  When I also disabled the folder in Library/Containers, the Mail application was able to start up.  <comment45625> Tried this, but it does not work for me to get of rid of my problem with Mail Default Reader preference selection. <comment45628> Then maybe it's better to ask a new question describing your issue. Screenshots may help as well. <comment139129> Which OS X version are you using? <comment196201> I tried this and now when I open mail after add an account it sits there doing nothing. It doesn't go get my mail from the server. <comment196202> The solution was aimed at OS X Lion, things may have changed in the meantime. If deleting the additional file listed in the other answer doesn't solve your problem, it might be better to ask a new question using the Ask Question link at the top. Please add a link/reference to this question here. <comment371044> What about **com.apple.mail-shared.plist**, should I remove that one too? <comment371094> @rraallvv Move it away and try :-)
