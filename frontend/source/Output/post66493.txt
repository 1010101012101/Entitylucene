Is there a way to monitor the stack of execution in order to find the longest hangs? <body> Related to this unsolved mystery: apple.stackexchange.com/questions/62416/why-do-i-get-serious-execution-lag-on-clicks-application-switching-and-general  I'm wondering if there's a way to see which processes hang the most and at what time. For instance, if I click on "New Tab" in Chrome, and it takes 7 seconds for it to open with 3 rainbow wheels appearing during that time, I would like to see an output like this:  precodeCPU1 : Chrome Helper: eventRegister 0.3s --- CPU2 : Chrome Helper: eventTrigger 1.4s CPU2 : kernel_task: &lt;&lt;unknown&gt;&gt; 4s /code/pre  I'm making stuff up, but basically some kind of debugger which shows the chain of execution and the time it took for each process (am I even using the right terminology?) to execute.  Right now, I have 5 second lags on simple toolbar menu openings, things are becoming unbearable. Disk diagnostics are all good, CPU is constantly under 10% and while RAM is pretty full (I have no apps I can turn off, IntelliJ and Chrome take up 4 GB by themselves already, let alone the rest) I still don't think the lag should be this bad. I would really like to get to the bottom of it, and having a debugger of this kind would help, if there is such a thing.  <comment78227> As I told you on that question, this is all because of the Java IDE’s high RAM and swap usage. Also see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12469828/low-memory-consuming-java-ide-for-mac-osx <comment78239> Aye, but I'd still like to know if there's an app for what I'm requesting here - I believe it could provide me with some valuable insight, as my computer is dead slow even when my JVM apps are completely off. <comment78254> If that’s the case, Chrome is known to be a memory hog. Can you post a screenshot of Activity Monitor in the Memory Tab? <comment78338> Certainly, here it is: http://bit.ly/UL0Ivz  It would really suck if this Mac failed so hard at the only thing it was designed to actually do - surfing. I'd rather buy a new non-Apple laptop than lose Chrome to be honest. <comment78397> Woah! Dude look. I need you to understand that Chrome **is a memory hog**. It’s Chrome which is taking up all your RAM, and it’s not because you have a Mac. I don’t know how many tabs you have open, but more than 1 GB usage for a browser is a little too much. <comment78445> I know it's a memory hog, but I use it on my Windows and on my Ubuntu rig as well with the same amount of tabs and the same tabs open (around 20 at a time), same amount of RAM on every rig, so where does this difference come from if not the OS? I never ran into problems even remotely similar to these I am experiencing on my iMac and Macbook. Other browsers don't behave better, Yandex is identical to Chrome, Firefox can get even worse and I'm not touching Opera or Safari with a ten foot pole. <comment78498> Chrome originates from the Chromium project, which was initially Linux-only. It was ported to Windows and Mac afterwards. Probably Google spends more time on improving memory management on Windows rather than OS X, as it is more popular. As for Linux, it was originally Linux only, so obviously it will have better memory management. Just a theory.
