Disable Wifi Hotspot Popup Window <body> Is there a way to disable the wifi popup window that was introduced in OS X Lion.  I know I can remove it from known wifi networks, but sometimes I do use this connection (It's the Starbucks free wifi next door). The problem arises when I am using Ethernet and maybe it flakes out, or OS X is doing something else, but It pops this window up to let me connect to the free wifi hotspot. I'd much rather have to do this manually (Using my web browser) rather than the "always on top" popup window it gives me.  I've looked around on the internet and have found no solutions, I was kind of hoping some network guru for sound codedefaults write blah.blah/code to disable it.  See image below for the popup window I'm seeing:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLrdf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer85846> Check this link. It works for me.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3308224?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <comment98980> explain brief answer here. Link can be gone some time. <comment106626> This esentially disables Captive Network Assistant.app Which lives at /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app -- the solution proposed is to rename that app to something like XCaptive Network Assistant.app so it can't run. Ideally we could disable, but this hacky work around probably works (though I haven't used it) <comment280648> Have a look at this Apple.SE thread, http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211593/how-to-disable-captive-apple-com/211604#211604
