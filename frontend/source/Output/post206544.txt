Can't transfer purchases from iPhone to iTunes in iOS 9 <body> After upgrading to iOS 9, I can't transfer purchases from my iPhone to iTunes. It happens to just start the process, then it finishes without transferring anything. However, I can still transfer purchases from my iPad with iOS 8.4 like before.  ul liiPhone 5c, iOS 9/li liiTunes 12.3/li liMacBook Pro 13" with Retina Display Mid 2014, OS X El Capitan/li /ul  Apparently, not many people happen to use this "transfer purchases" feature so it didn't get any real attention. I used it a lot, I used to update my apps on my iPhone, transfer them to iTunes and updated my iPad apps using iTunes. Still, I can update my apps using iTunes and update apps on all my devices.  <answer206545> Actually, this is not a problem. Transferring purchases from devices with iOS 9 has been disabled by Apple. This is the response they gave to submitted bug reports regarding this issue:     strongApple Developer Relations 18-Sep-2015 02:51 PM/strong      This issue behaves as intended based on the following: Apps are no   longer transferred from iOS 9 devices. We are now closing this bug   report. If you have questions about the resolution, or if this is   still a critical issue for you, then please update your bug report   with that information.   As NetherLinks explained in the comments, it's because of the App Thinning feature Apple introduced in iOS 9. Basically, a different version of each app is downloaded on each device. So, apps downloaded on an iPhone cannot be used on an iPad. See image below taken from App Thinning page in iOS Developer Library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/waMMU.png" alt="App Thinning"  <comment248959> You can still update the apps directly in iTunes (and sync them to your iDevices) <comment248995> @patrix Of course. The reason I update my apps using my iPhone is that if I update all my apps using iTunes, the App Store's badge (which indicates how many updates are available) doesn't disappear and it's annoying. <comment249156> Is it possible that this may also be related to App Thinning in that the app transferred from your phone wouldn't work on other device types anyways? <comment249162> @NetherLinks That's a really nice guess. Sounds completely logical. [This image](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Art/app_thinning_2x.png) from Developer Library conveys the same thing. <comment249264> @NetherLinks Do you mind if I edit my answer and add the information you gave? <comment249269> @Behdad Go ahead. <comment249308> I update my iPhone Apps and then use to update rest of the families iPhone apps Now we need to update all separately if not using update in iTunes ?? <comment249309> I'm afraid yes.

Apple should have made this much clearer. <comment250899> Could you add the version of iTunes and iOS? Presumably the fixes in Xcode 7.0.1 and related updates will correct this going forward? <comment250928> @bmike I think I'm missing something here, I already noted that I'm using iOS 9 (9.1 PB actually) and iTunes 12.3. Moreover, I explained in my answer that this not a bug, it's supposed to act this way because of App Thinning. <comment257758> - Can apps downloaded on iTunes be sent to both iPad and iPhone? - Why is iTunes 12.3.0.4 not allowing me to buy & download free apps or update/ download existing purchases from cloud? <comment257760> Q1 - Can apps downloaded on iTunes be sent to both iPad and iPhone?...
