How to create an Automator service to convert images from one file type into another file type using the right-click contextual menu? <body> Is it possible to create an Automator service to convert one file type into another file type using the right click contextual menu (eg strongJPEG, PDF, PNG, TIFF/strong) without the need to install a dedicated app to accomplish the desired file conversion.  <answer94186> Here is an example Automator workflow to convert image files to a specific type:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fg4lQ.png" alt="Automator Workflow"  When creating your workflow, don't forget to set it to a Service so that it can be accessed in the context menu.  The Copy Finder Items makes sure that the original files don't get replaces. You can change the save location to a variable if you wish, or just delete that action and let it replace the original file.  If you would like the option of which file type you would like, you can create multiple service workflows with different names (and different file formats for the Change Type of Images action).  <comment247916> Its working fine, I would like to know how to copy the out put of this into a path say "Converted" which is in the same directory of input file. If the folder not exists, it should create.    I need this because if we are converting a bunch  of files, original and converted files will mess up <comment247917> @Johnykutty Ask a full separate questionâ€”comments aren't suitable for this. Link to this Q&A in the question. Ping me in chat and I'll have a look at it. <comment248048> updated my question [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/205597/convert-image-type-and-save-to-relative-folder-with-automator), can you give an answer to that
