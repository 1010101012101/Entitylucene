PHP version shown in command line differs from phpinfo(); in localhost:8000 <body> I started my OS X PHP test server by typing  precodephp -S localhost:8000 /code/pre  I updated my PHP on OS X to 5.6 and when I check the version through the command line by typing:  precodephp -v /code/pre  It tells me that I have "PHP 5.6.5"  When I start my PHP test server and look at the index.php file that has the codephpinfo();/code function, it tells me that I still have version 5.5.14 that comes with OS X.  What can I do to get my PHP version on localhost:8000 to reflect that change?  <answer171695> The new version of PHP needs to be in your $PATH and the path to the new version of php needs to be listed before code/usr/bin/code. If the new version of php (the executable) is installed in code/usr/local/bin//code you should be in good shape, otherwise you need to either  link the new php executable there (codeln -s /path/to/newphp /usr/local/bin/php/code) or add it's location to your $PATH (codeexport PATH=/path/to/newphp:"${PATH}"/code) (&lt;- add this to your ~/.bash_profile).  One other possibility to check... is the new version of php named codephp/code? It's possible that it will be named something like codephp5/code or some such thing. If so you'll need to create a a link or use that name on the command line.  <comment202004> Where did you install the updated PHP and what is your current $PATH? (type `echo $PATH` in Terminal). It sounds like the $PATH isn't set up to find the new version of PHP. <comment202008> I installed to "/usr/local".   When I checked the path with "echo $PATH" I saw "/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/bin:/Applications/Server.app/Contents/ServerRoot/usr/sbin".   I deleted the Server App recently. Should I export the path? <comment317556> Well, I upgrade to PHP 7 in `/usr/local/bin/` but my version remains in 5.6.24. The installer created a php5 alias and I created a php alias manually. But both `?php phpinfo();?` and `php -v` tells me I am using the old one. And I tried `export PATH=/usr/local/bin/php5-7.0.11-20160923-203451:"${PATH}"` too.
