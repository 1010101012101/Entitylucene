Script that outputs number of emails in Mail.app inbox  <body> I'd like to have a command-line script I can invoke at the Terminal that will output the total number of messages in my "Work" Inbox in mail.app. Usage would look like this:  precode$ inbox-count 48 /code/pre  What does the Applescript code look like to do something like this?  <answer7902> If you want to get the number of messages in said inbox, the short form of the code is  precodetell application "Mail" to ¬   get the count of messages of mailbox "INBOX" of account "Work" /code/pre  If you want the global inbox, then you can use codeget the count of messages of inbox/code instead.  If you just want unread messages, then you can use codeget the unread count of mailbox "INBOX" of account "Work"/code.  And if you want a more complete script, this will do the trick:  precode#!/usr/bin/osascript property defaultAccount : "Work" property defaultMailbox : "INBOX"  on run args   set justUnread to false   set theAccount to missing value   set theMailbox to missing value    if defaultAccount = missing value then set defaultAccount to "-g"   if defaultMailbox = missing value then set defaultMailbox to "INBOX"    set theCount to the count of args    if theCount &gt; 0 then     if item 1 of args = "-u" then       set justUnread to true       set theCount to theCount - 1       set args to the rest of args     else if item 1 of args = "-ug" or item 1 of args = "-gu" then       set justUnread to true       set item 1 of args to "-g"     else if theCount &gt; 1 and ¬             item 1 of args = "-g" and item 2 of args = "-u" then       set justUnread to true       set theCount to theCount - 1       set args to the rest of args       set item 1 of args to "-g"     end if   end if    tell application "Mail"     if theCount = 0 then       set theAccount to defaultAccount       set theMailbox to defaultMailbox     else if theCount = 1 then       set theAccount to item 1 of args       set theMailbox to defaultMailbox     else if theCount = 2 then       set theAccount to item 1 of args       set theMailbox to item 2 of args     else       error character id 10 ¬           &amp; "Usage: inbox-count [-u] [[account] mailbox]" &amp; character id 10 ¬           &amp; "       inbox-count [-u] -g [mailbox]"     end if      set mailboxValue to missing value     if theAccount = "-g" then       if theMailbox = "INBOX" then         set mailboxValue to inbox       else         set mailboxValue to mailbox theMailbox       end if     else       set mailboxValue to mailbox theMailbox of account theAccount     end if      if justUnread then       return the unread count of mailboxValue     else       return the count of messages of mailboxValue     end if   end tell end run /code/pre  Most of that is command-line parsing, because that's a pain to get right in AppleScript.  But the upshot is that with that script in your path as codeinbox-count/code, then the following commands work:  ul licodeinbox-count/code to check the number of messages in the default mailbox/account pair./li licodeinbox-count -g/code to check the number of messages in the global (combined) inbox./li licodeinbox-count Play/code to check the number of messages in the default mailbox for the account "Play"./li licodeinbox-count -g Important/code to check the number of messages in the global mailbox "Important"./li licodeinbox-count Play Facebook/code to check the number of messages in the mailbox "Facebook" for the account "Play"./li /ul  You can also prepend a code-u/code to any of those commands (eme.g./em, codeinbox-count -u/code, codeinbox-count -ug/code, codeinbox-count -u Play Facebook/code) to just get the unread count.  To change the default account and mailbox, change the lines codeproperty defaultAccount : "Work"/code and codeproperty defaultMailbox : "INBOX"/code.  If codedefaultAccount/code is codemissing value/code or code"-g"/code, then the default will be to not use an account; if codedefaultMailbox/code is codemissing value/code or code"INBOX"/code, then the default will be to either use a mailbox named code"INBOX"/code or, if the account is code"-g"/code, to use the global inbox.  <comment8548> @Iorin: what is your question? whether it can be done? <comment8550> @calavera: Looking for the Applescript code. I clarified the question. <comment8552> What do you mean by "size" number of kilobytes? unread messages? total messages? <comment8574> @zevlag: total number of message. I've updated the question. <comment8575> Wow. I was just going to suggest something like `ls /Path/To/MailBox/*.emlx | wc -l` for messages in a box, but yours is definitely the better answer. Thanks! <comment60944> Typo in the script above... `else if theCount = 2 then set theAccount to item 1 of args set theMailbox to item 1 of args` should be `else if theCount = 2 then set theAccount to item 1 of args set theMailbox to item 2 of args` <comment60945> @SamuelMinter: Thanks; that's fixed now.
