How do I change the UI language in Snow Leapoard? <body> I'd like to change my MacBook's languages of the UI. How would I do that in Snow Leopard?  <answer16355> Open System Preferences, and then Language &amp; Text. Drag the language you want on top and then log-off (or restart) your computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgZvO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment32537> Do some languages need to be "downloaded" via an update or something? <comment32713> In Snow Leopard languages came in the Install CD.
