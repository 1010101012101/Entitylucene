Disable snapshot sound during screen capture keyboard shortcut on 10.8+ <body> I'm not using Grab, but the screenshot shortcut (i.e., Command (⌘)-Shift-3 and Command (⌘)-Shift-4). A loud snapshot sound plays whenever I screengrab. How can I turn off this sound, and is there any way other than disabling all system sound effects? Perhaps with a Terminal command? I'm looking specifically for 10.8+, if it matters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9hVUA.png" alt="Sound"  <answer100950> You can replace the codeGrab.aif/code file with a blank audio file:  (Directory location is on the bottom of the Finder window) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Kxzc.png" alt="enter image description here" Just make sure it has the same permissions and make a backup of the file before you replace it.  h2Links/Resources/h2  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=797999  <comment118860> i don't know if you know this, but a quick tap on the mute button before taking the picture will do the trick
