Content pane in Mail <body> I use Mail with emclassical layout/em in Preferences-View. I have a list of folders on the left. The right has a list of emails on the top and the content of the selected mail on bottom.  I dragged the separator between list of email and content to the very bottom, so that I can see only the list of emails. I did it sometimes and I could restore the separator when I need it.  The problem now is that the separator cannot be restored anymore, so the only option to see the content of an email is to double-click on it, opening a new window, and it is uncomfortable.  I tried renaming code/Users/enzotib/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/code and code/Users/enzotib/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Saved Application State/code, but this has no effect on what I need.  How to make the bottom content pane to appear again, or al least how to reset Mail preferences?
