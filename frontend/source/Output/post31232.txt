Does removing the battery while connected to power extend battery life? <body> On regular Windows notebooks people generally remove their battery packs when connected to a power source, in order to extend battery life.  Does a similar approach work on the Mac?  <answer31238> On many recent Macs, you cannot remove the battery (at least not easily), so this simply wouldn't work.  In general, it's kind of pointless to do that, as you're negating a benefit of having the battery: if the power goes out or the cable gets pulled (especially if it's a magnetic cable), you lose power just like a desktop would.  Ultimately, I would recommend not bothering in either the Mac or Windows case.  <answer31462> Since OSX has protection built-in to keep from continuously charging the battery, you shouldn't remove it, there is no benefit.  Part of that protection is that if you plug in your laptop 95% charge, it won't actually charge the battery, and will run off of the power adapter.          <comment35818> It's interesting that you say people "generally" remove the battery when on mains power: nobody at my company of 500+ does that, and I've never seen anybody do it, even at university. (Not that I don't believe you, but it's interesting how different people's ideas of "normal" can differ.) <comment35826> No, you don't need to remove your battery. Just keep it away from excessive heat and avoid leaving it in a constant state of a 100% charge (this means using it from time to time) and you'll be fine. Stop worrying about it! <comment89683> Is there a reference about the built-in protection?
