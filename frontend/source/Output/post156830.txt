OS X 10.9.x failed login attempts previous days <body> I have found some answers on here but need to check something. Is there a way to check the failed login attempts form previous days?  I have tried:  precodevar/log/secure.log  /code/pre  but that only gives me results for the current day and I need them for the past 4 days ideally.  Have also used  precodecat /private/var/log/system.log | grep "Failed to authenticate" /code/pre  And again only todays results.  Thanks in advance!  <answer156833> As the logs is rotating, you could find the info you need on previos files. After some predefined size, the logs files are moved and compressed. See example image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4MGFT.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, you have to look after files that suits your dates requirements and uncompress it using codegunzip filename.gz/code command.  Then you can codegrep/code your pattern on those files.
