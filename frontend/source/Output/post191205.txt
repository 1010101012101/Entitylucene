Send SMS/text messages from Windows through USB + iPhone? <body> I use the MyPhoneExplorer (MPE) utility to send SMS/text message from my Windows host through my Android smartphone connected to the computer with a USB cable. It's a no-brainer.  A friend of mine has an iPhone and a Windows laptop: I was wondering if there's an equivalent to MPE that can work with an iPhone:  ol liRuns on Windows and iPhone/li liWindows and iPhone connected through USB cable/li /ol  Connecting both hosts (Windows laptop + iPhone smartphone) to wifi just for this is overkill.  Thank you.  <answer191224> Not without jail breaking the iPhone. There are numerous tweaks available on Cydia (jail break equivalent of App Store) that enable this functionality.   iPhones and a Mac computer will both send SMS messages natively from your phone number, but this isn't available on Windows.   <comment227341> Thanks. I'll investigate how to jailbreak and if texting can be done from Windows
