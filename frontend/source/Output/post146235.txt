Where is the index.html on OSX 10.9 (Mavericks) Apache setup? <body> I've started up Apache on my Mac and get the "It works!" message, but I have no idea where that file is.  I've checked the httpd.conf file and the location listed is:  DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents"  Yet, when I go to the /Library/WebServer/Documents folder, it is empty!  This one is driving me crazy, any help would be appreciated.  <answer146244> There should be 3 files in /Library/WebServer/Documents:  ul liindex.html.en/li liPoweredByMacOSX.gif/li liPoweredByMacOSXLarge.gif/li /ul  If these files are missing, it really shouldn't matter.  As soon as you create your own HTML file and place it in that folder, the "It works!" message should be replaced with your new index.html file.  Hope this helps.  <answer245634> copy index.html.en to just index.html and you'll be able to see your changed index.html file.   Just figured this out.  <comment172460> Thanks Thomas, although I created a new html file, and still get the "It works!".  It has to be somewhere else, since no files even existed in that folder. <comment172663> Do you have homebrew installed? MAMP? Server.app? In fact can you just give us a list of what you do have installed? It sounds like you may not be using the default apache for os x. <comment172724> Is there a folder in the /Library/Server/Web/Data/Sites/ path called Default? <comment211770> have you restarted the server? apachectl restart
