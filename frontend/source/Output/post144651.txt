Calendar will not display <body> When I view calendars on iOS, all can see is an "i" with a circle around it.  If I click the i, it just brings up the calendar color.    I can not view any of the calendar items.  The same calendar on my mac is working.  <answer144653> NEVER MIND!  I realized that it was simply updating the new data I added to the calendar.  It took 1 day to do that for some reason.  I reconnected to the mac and synced it again, and it is finally working.
