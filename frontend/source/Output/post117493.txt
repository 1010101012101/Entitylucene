After upgrade of retail iWork 09 DVD it appeard on my Apple Store account <body> I found my iWork 09 retail DVD, which I bought 4.5 years ago. After I installed it, Apple Store showed me that I've got an strongupgrade/strong to version 13. Next, it appeared on my Apple Store account in purchases, after upgrade. Is it normal behaviour or it is a bug?  <answer117494> It's a normal behaviour so you can directly download the new Pages, Keynote &amp; Numbers on your new Macs (or new OSX installations).   <comment137288> That's cool! Thank you!
