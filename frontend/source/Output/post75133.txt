How to add multiple tracks from Finder to iTunes now playing list? <body> The new iTunes 11 finally contains a list with the current and to be played titles.  I'd like to add multiple files from the Finder to that list.  Is that possible somehow?  <comment87227> From the Finder? You only can add tracks which are already in iTunes. <comment182497> How is there not an answer to this? iTunes is awful for playing files in a folder with different artists/album names. Windows has an explorer context menu option for this. And no, not everyone wants to have to create playlists.
