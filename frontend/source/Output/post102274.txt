Deleting more than one song at one time on my iPhone? <body> I need help finding a way to delete more than one song at a time on my iPhone. Can someone tell me if that is possible?  I have tried deleting songs on my iTunes and then syncing them but it does not work and it takes way too much time.  <answer102327> You can do it by deleting albums, artists or compilations from the respective views. Swipe right on the item to get the codeDelete/code button and tap it to delete an entire album, an entire artist's works or an entire compilation. This still works only one (album or artist or compilation) at a time. There is no way to select multiple albums or artists or compilations for deletion.  <answer143620> you cant delete albums or artists on the i phone. you just have to delete songs 1 by 1  <comment120492> Which iOS version? <comment171700> I could not delete albums/artists, swipe right and nothing happens, on 5s/ios7
