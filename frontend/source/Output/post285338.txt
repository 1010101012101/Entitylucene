iPhone 7 app OpenVPN discharge the battery immediately <body> After installing a configuring OpenVPN iOS App the battery is empty after a few hours. Latest iOS release and iPhone 7.     OpenVPN Connect is the official full-featured iPhone/iPad VPN   client for the OpenVPN Access Server, Private Tunnel VPN, and OpenVPN   Community, developed by OpenVPN Technologies, Inc.   I found a possible solution in forums.openvpn.net, but don't understand the instructions. Can you clarify?
