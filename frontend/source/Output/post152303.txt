Mac Terminal view is Screen Sharing is Enabled <body> Is there a way to use Terminal to check to see if Screen Sharing/Remote Desktop is enabled? Or is there a file which will have a YES/NO of it?  The one catch; it must work without sudo or admin privileges.  <answer152306> You can check if coderfb/code port is opened (5900) with:  precodenetstat -atp tcp | grep rfb /code/pre  <answer152311> You can do so by checking for the existence of the launchd files in /etc:  precode[[ -f /etc/RemoteManagement.launchd ]] &amp;&amp; echo 'enabled' || echo 'disabled' /code/pre  or for screen sharing:  precode[[ -f /etc/com.apple.screensharing.agent.launchd ]] &amp;&amp; echo 'enabled' || echo 'disabled' /code/pre  <comment179213> That will show if Screen Sharing is running, but not Remote Management.
