MacPro1,1 upgrade to 10.6 <body> What is possible OSX upgrade for MacPro1,1 Dual-Core Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz?  Now still using using 10.5.8 (Leopard)  <answer97829> According to the tech specs, you should be able to use OS X Lion (10.7) with the following specs:  ul liMac computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor/li li2GB of memory/li liOS X v10.6.6 or later (v10.6.8 recommended)/li li7GB of available space/li /ul  That would suggest to me that you would need to get onto 10.6 (Snow Leopard) + all updates and then could get to OSX Lion (10.7).  Mountain Lion+ Specifies an "early 2008 Mac Pro or newer", yours appears to be the iteration just before that.  <comment114801> Yes, I used Snow Leopard on my 1,1 for a long time. <comment114828> Many Thanks, nerdwaller thats very clear.
