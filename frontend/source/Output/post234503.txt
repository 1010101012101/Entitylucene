iPhone 5S not charging after iOS 9.3.1 update <body> I recently update my iPhone 5s from iOS9.2.1 to iOS 9.3.1. After the update I can't charging. When I connect Cable which comes with iPhone, it displays error message "This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone." Even iTunes connect to it.  I have tried few things:  precodeRestarted iPhone. Tried connect to my iTunes on windows Tried different iPhone Charging adapter. /code/pre  None of them worked.  Is there any solution for this problem????   <comment286689> Are these actually genuine Apple cables, or 3rd party? <comment286851> @Tetsujin Actual apple cable comes with the package <comment286852> Test the lightning cable both ways round. Sometimes one way works better than the other. It might suggest the contacts need cleaning, though, or the electronics in the cable has failed.
