Can Time Machine backup two HDDs to Time Capsule? <body> I have two physical harddrives in my Mac.  One is an SSD with the OS and apps.  The other is a 1TB HDD for media. Can I setup time machine to backup both drives to time capsule?  <answer94116> Yes, by default Time Machine will backup all internal HDD's whether they are SSD or not. Just make sure your time capsule is big enough.  <comment110345> +1. Time Machine will also backup ***external*** drives plugged in to your Mac (except the Time Machine drive, naturally).
