Why would MacOS not load Thunderbolt related kexts? <body> Issue: My 2012 iMac does not see any device plugged into either TB1 port. The same test device works on other Macs. System profiler - Software - Extensions reports no Thunderbolt related kexts are loaded.  ol liWhy would kexts not be loaded?/li liIs it possible to force the kexts to be loaded?/li /ol  I have already reset the NVRAM/SMC multiple times, and upgraded the system to 10.12.   Cheers
