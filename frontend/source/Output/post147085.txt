Bind Ctrl+C to Copy function for eclipse on mac os x doesn't work <body> I'm just moving my coding work from Windows to mac os x. It's really difficult to get used to the kbdctrl/kbd and codecommand/code key behavior at beginning.   Then I tried bind kbdctrl/kbd + kbdC/kbd to codeCopy/code function instead of kbdcommand/kbd + kbdC/kbd in eclipse preferences setting. The setting was saved but took no effort. When I press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdC/kbd on text and then pasted it, nothing happened.  I also don't want to switch the function of kbdCtrl/kbd and kbdCommand/kbd because many terminal operation still need the original kbdCtrl/kbd function.  Does kbdCtrl+C/kbd conflict with some system shortcut?  Could anybody tell me how to fix this? Or are there any better approaches?   <answer147236> Yes, there are better approaches.  Open:  System Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts  Highlight the App Shortcuts on left pane.  You will see a list of apps on the right.  Click the Plus sign and then select Eclipse for the app, type the menu item, type your new keyboard shortcut and you are done:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vUGqV.png" alt="Here is what you need  to do"  <comment173386> My advice is : If you work on a Mac get used to use Command instead of Ctrl. It will save you a lot of pain (and you'll get access to a lot of new keyboard shortcuts) <comment173442> @MatthieuRiegler Thanks for your advice. I'll try. A further question, what should I do if I want a PgUp or PgDn function?
