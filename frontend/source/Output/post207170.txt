Is it still possible to get @icloud.com email address? <body> Set up a new iCloud account for someone and I am not seeing the option to set up an @icloud.com address and use the free email service. Does anyone know if this is still possible and how to go about doing this?   <answer207192> The steps seem strange, but first you must create your appleid using a non Apple address (note that if you already have an @icloud, @mac, or @me email address that email address is already an Apple ID)   Once your Apple ID has been created, on the device go to Settings  iCloud and flip the mail switch on, you will be prompted there to create your @icloud.com email address.  Alternatively, you can go to setting and go to mail. From there, add account and choose iCloud. If you choose "create Apple ID" at this screen, for whatever reason, it will allow you to create an "@icloud.com" email.  source Apple kb  <answer207193> Using a Mac:  System Preferences - Internet Accounts - (Maybe you need to click the +) - Select iCloud on the right - Create Apple ID - Follow the steps  Also note that after entering your birthday, you should select "Get a free iCloud email address".  <answer237518> iCloud accounts are different for different devices. If you are using iPhone, iPad or even an iPod Touch you can use iCloud. iCloud is Apple’s own icloud service which allows you to save all the data which is present on your iPhone on the online cloud.

It doesn't explain *how* to do it. <comment249820> I can't do it, which is why I asked if the link helped, but do what the next line after that says... Go to Settings  iCloud and turn the mail switch on, I think that's the point you get to create it <comment249834> I see what you mean now, I will try this later and update this thread. I do not remember having to set up mail on the physical device previously. <comment249836> Go to [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com), and click _"Create Your Now"_. <comment249840> Confirmed, I just tried this on someone else's phone.  I'll make it an answer. <comment249863> Welcome to Ask Different! That's a great first answer.
