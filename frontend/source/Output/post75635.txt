Visual Git Software that Supports Network Repos <body> So I've tried out quite a few visual git tools (Tower, GitBox SourceTree), but the I'm running into trouble.  On our developer environments, we don't clone into our local machines, we clone into our user directory on a development server on our network (has smb).  We use keys in each users respective code.ssh/code directory on the server to authenticate, which these softwares don't seem to support.  They're also slow when it comes to showing me the working directory (especially source tree).  Is there some software that can handle all this for git?  A standalone web app would also work.  <comment87808> The slowness is more likely attributed to working over SMB instead of the Git tools you've tried before...
