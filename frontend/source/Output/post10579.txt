How can I convert a pdf to a format that is compatible with iBooks <body> I have a pdf file, which I would like to convert to iBook compatible format, which software can I use to do this? calibre seems to be too tough to work with  <answer10586> The good news: you don't have to! iBooks will happily take PDF files and display them just fine and dandy.  <comment11068> You know you can add PDF files to iBook, right? <comment11237> yea, i know that we can add pdf files to iBooks, but it wud look like a pdf and letters would be too small to read :)
