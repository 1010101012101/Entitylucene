Startup disks are disabled after upgrading to OS X El Capitan <body> Recently I upgraded my Mac mini to OS X El Capitan. After the upgrade completed, I can't select a startup disk in System Preferences - Startup Disk.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPHEc.png" alt="enter image description here"  emBOOTCAMP/Windows/em is disabled here. Searching for a solution I came across the following: press and hold the Option key while booting to get all available systems, but that trick didn't work for me. Any solution will be highly appreciable.  <answer214543> Click the lock to make changes  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TnQnf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment259186> By this solution every time I need to click this lock. Is there any permanent solution? <comment259217> I don't think so. Even with SIP turned off, it still requires admin authority to edit certain System Prefs. <comment301034> Why did they make this change? It's an annoying hassle. <comment301040> You'd have to ask Apple that.
