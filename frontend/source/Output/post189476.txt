Using cask and then brew install <body> I am trying to install gulp - which seems to require first cask:  precode17:14:34/mozaik-demo $brew install gulp Error: No available formula for gulp Searching formulae... Searching taps... Caskroom/cask/gulp /code/pre  Let us install the cask:  precode17:14:41/mozaik-demo $brew cask install gulp ==&gt; Downloading https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-app/releases/download/0.1.0/gulp.app.zip ######################################################################## 100.0% ==&gt; Symlinking App 'gulp.app' to '/Users/steve/Applications/gulp.app'   gulp staged at '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/gulp/0.1.0' (830 files, 75M) /code/pre  But then what is the correct next step? Here is my attempt:  precode17:15:03/mozaik-demo $brew install gulp Error: No available formula for gulp Searching formulae... Searching taps... Caskroom/cask/gulp 17:15:09/mozaik-demo $which gulp /code/pre  <answer189489> You don't need to do codebrew install gulp/code after codebrew cask install gulp/code. Once codebrew cask install gulp/code end, you have your app installed on code/Users/steve/Applications/gulp.app/code, you don't need any extra steps.  <comment224733> do I need to add /Users/steve/Applications to my path then? <comment224734> I don't think so. <comment224735> Last line of the OP:  " $which gulp".  None in the path.  I will in any case add it and see what happens <comment224736> I do not know how to use gulp.app.  21:55:35/mozaik-demo $gulp publish bash: gulp: command not found <comment224739> I am going to look up cask install, seems to be stuff going on that I need to better understand. <comment224740> Gulp is a graphical app, you have to go to `/Users/steve/Applications` and double click on `gulp` to open. <comment224741> I am following directions that say "gulp publish"  so then how to do that? There is a gulpfile.js in the given directory. This is probably a node.js thing. I know almost zero about node <comment224742> What you install from `brew cask` is this: https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-app Don't seems that allow `gulp publish`. <comment224803> You are headed the right direction on this thanks.
