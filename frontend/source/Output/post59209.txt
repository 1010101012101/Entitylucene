How to move from text to text by keyboard in Powerpoint? <body> How do I move from text item to text item using the keyboard in Powerpoint? (Apologies for the Windows keyboard terminology in the following)  ul likbdtab/kbd just adds a tab, as does kbdShift/kbd + kbdTab/kbd, kbdControl/kbd + kbdTab/kbd, and kbdAlt/kbd + kbdTab/kbd. kbdWindows/kbd + kbdTab/kbd switches application./li likbdenter/kbd adds a newline, as does kbdShift/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd and kbdControl/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd. kbdAlt/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd starts a presentation, as does kbdWindows/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd./li /ul  I tried looking at http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/powerpoint/item/13dfdf52-4ce3-4ec5-aeff-5b49f8392aea, but couldn't find what I wanted.  <answer59211> Use kbdalt/kbdkbdwindows/kbdkbdenter/kbd to indicate you've finished a piece of text and want to move on to the next section, possibly creating a new slide.  Use kbdesc/kbd to escape from whatever you're editing, emthen/em use kbdtab/kbd to move from text to text within a slide, and use kbdPage Up/kbd and kbdPage Down/kbd to move from slide to slide, and use kbdEnter/kbd to start editing a text.  <comment68623> If someone reasonably experienced in keyboard shortcuts could confirm that there's no better options, I'd accept either their or my answer.
