Remove auto login to a dead server OS X <body> I'm trying to remove an auto login to a dead share but it won't let me do it, any suggestions? There is an exclamation warning after the name of the server in my Users &amp; Groups  Login Items in my preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dcWmO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253443> If it's greyed out then it means it's defined by the administrator (either MCX or profiles). Look in System Information under either Managed Client or Profiles to see where it's coming from.
