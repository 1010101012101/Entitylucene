Why does Apple's face recognition in Photos fail so utterly on asian people? <body> As I'm married to a Japanese woman, I've a lot of photos of friends and family from Japan. What I commonly recognise is, that Apple's face recognition utterly fails to differ between Japanese people.   While my western friends and family only take a few adjustments to have all faces recognised, on Japanese faces it seems like a hit and miss with nearly all pictures containing a Japanese face. Mostly I have to select about 80% of the pictures manually. The app often suggest faces from the wrong gender, totally unrelated people, pictures of children for adults.  It's like the algorithm is totally failing, except for that never a western face appears in the suggestions.  Is it really that hard to differ between asian faces or is the used algorithm just not optimised for this?  As my household only contains Apple devices I've no possibility to check out for other platforms to confirm that the similar look of Asians is the cause or simply the App's algorithm is rubbish.  <comment360686> Welcome to Ask Different. Asking why Apple does X is off topic. If there's a practical question to answer - perhaps, "given your experience that faces from a specific ethnicity are not recognized - how can you increase the quality or how can you manually assign faces" would be more on topic here.
