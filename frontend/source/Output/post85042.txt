Sort Finder columns reversed <body> I can't get this reversed thing to work:  precodeTell application "Finder" to set the sort direction of the modification date column to reversed /code/pre  <answer85073> There are some useful links in the answers to this question. I would recommend using the Accessibility Inspector, which is part of XCode, to find the names of the various elements you are trying to address with your script. You can also try some of the scripts linked here, in particular the first one (edited slightly):  precodeset appname to "Finder"  set winstuff to "defaultval" set menustuff to "defaultval"  tell application appname   activate end tell  tell application "System Events"   tell process appname     set winstuff to entire contents of front window     set menustuff to entire contents of menu bar 1   end tell end tell --return winstuff &amp; "rrrr" &amp; menustuff -- comment this out to get just winstuff return winstuff -- comment this out too to get just menustuff --return menustuff /code/pre  Unfortunately I'm not in front of a Mac right now, but from these tools you should be able to find out the element to address.  <answer85144> There is a bug in 10.7 and 10.8 where changing the sort direction doesn't always work unless you change the sort column first (see this question).  precodetell application "Finder" to tell list view options of window 1     set sort column to name column     set sort column to modification date column     set sort direction of column modification date column to reversed end tell /code/pre  <answer85430> I think i found another bug. This code does not make kind column invisible.  precodetell application "Finder" to set visible of column id kind column of list view options of front window to false /code/pre  <comment97952> Welcome to Ask Different.
