"Glitched" pixels, El Capitan, formula box in numbers <body> Today I installed El Capitan on my Macbook Pro and noticed some weird graphical effects when I was editing my numbers document:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJWGT.png" alt="Glitched pixels around numbers&#39; formula box"  I know that this is entirely software-related, otherwise the screen shot tool couldn't have captured it, and it turns on and off randomly, with mouse-overs and hovers.  Does anyone know a possible cause and fix of this?

Or could there have been an automatic update in-between which fixed it? <comment253395> I'd do it only if it comes back.  Like you said, update may have fixed it.  Cheers!
