Limited FaceBook friends show up in Contacts app in Mavericks or Yosemite <body> I configured my Facebook account in OS X (both Mavericks &amp; Yosemite) using following article  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18993  I have 200+ friends on FB, but on Contacts app it just shows 38. Remaining are missing, I don't know what I have done wrong.  Moreover, I have allowed events and birthday calendar to sync as well, but not all birthday events are showing up in OS X calendar app.  Help much appreciated. Thanks.  p.s. I followed following article ( http://www.scrubly.com/blog/how-to-mac/how-to-set-up-social-media-accounts-in-mavericks-and-why/ ) as well, but result is same. Not all FB friends show up.  <answer228998> It is possible that only the contacts that have provided useful contact information to Facebook are showing up in your OS X Contacts app. This article suggests that Facebook would be no longer adding contacts with no contact info to to your address book: Facebook aims to declutter the iOS Contacts app by no longer syncing friends without useful contact info
