Can I change which day I get the Activity.app weekly summary? <body> I always get it on Monday but I would like to get it on Sunday.  <answer193547> Looks like it probably isn't possible. In Apple Watch.app - My Watch - Activity there is a toggle that says:     When this is on, every Monday you'll get a brief recap of your Move   performance from the previous week, and you can adjust your Move goal   for the upcoming week   Which to me suggests there isn't a setting for changing the day you receive the recap.
