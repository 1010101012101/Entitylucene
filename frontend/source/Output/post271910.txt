Is there a way to view Unicode values in the "Emoji and Symbols"? <body> The emoji and symbol window is good for inserting into documents, but when I need the actual Unicode values, it isn't anywhere in the UI. Is there any way to get those information?  <answer271911> From the Emoji &amp; Symbols panel, top left there's a gear icon. It looks greyed- out always but it's not.  Customise List... scroll right down, Reveal Code Tables &amp; Check Unicode.  The unicode values will then appear in the preview pane for all characters  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6T0td.png" alt="enter image description here"
