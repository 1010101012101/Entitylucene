Time Capsule still provides Wi-Fi but is not discovered by AirPort Utility <body> I connect to the Internet with my Time Capsule's Wi-Fi, and it works perfectly. I also have been backing up to the same Time Capsule with Time Machine. But now, after about 18 months, Time Machine complains that it can not find the backup drive. I checked AirPort Utility, and there I just see the "Internet" sphere and the green dot letting me know I'm connected successfully. The Time Capsule neither shows up nor can it be discovered.  I rebooted the Time Capsule several times. LED is first yellow and then green, like I'd expect as normal.  strongWhat could be wrong? How can I troubleshoot?/strong  <answer266534> Follow these steps and it should be OK:  ol liPress the reset button on the Time Capsule./li liForget the old time capsule in Airport Utility./li liRe-add the reset Time Capsule./li liUpdate the Time Capsule's firmware./li /ol  The Back to My Mac function caused it to be not seen by the Airport Utility despite it working fine otherwise.
