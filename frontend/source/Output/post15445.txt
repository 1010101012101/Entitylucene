How do I install Homebrew on Tiger? <body> According to this previous question, I want to install Homebrew Tiger branch on my iBook running ... well, Tiger. Unfortunatly, when running the Ruby one-liner,  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731/39fc1416e34b9f6db201b4a026181f4ceb7cfa74)" /code/pre  I always get the following error :  precodeThis script requires the user nicolas to be in the staff group. If this sucks for you then you can install Homebrew in your home directory or however you please; please refer to the website. If you still want to use this  script the following command should work:  dscl /Local/Default -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership $USER /code/pre  I have unsuccessfully tried to add myself as a member of the codestaff/code group.  What can I do to install Homebrew on my Tiger mac ?  Thanks  strongEDIT/strong Yes, I have a version of XCode for my platform, it's a legacy 2.5 that I installed specifically for that purpose.  Concerning the Ruby script, a rapid overview of its code indicates that the error appears as invoking codegroups/code does not return the staff group.  And indeed, when I issue this command by hand, I get  precode$ groups nicolas appserveradm appserverusr admin /code/pre  So, how can I add myself to the codestaff/code group in a fashion that this command will understand ?  <answer15508> I haven't Tiger, so something only from my memory:  the above dscl should work. Or you can try the following:  precodedscl . -append /Groups/staff GroupMembership $USER /code/pre  you can ensure who is added with  precodeecho $USER /code/pre  should print your short username.  If this does not works, here is the more dangerous way. If I remember good, on Tiger is an application /Applications/Utilities/Netinfo Manager.app (or something like with Netino)  You should start it and check it. Unfortunately I'm not remembering what exactly you must do. One thing: when you change something, in the menu is something like "Restart Netinfo Server", and you must restart it, when you make changes.  strongWarning: REALLY (really really!) be very careful. You can lock out yourself from the machine, and will must start OS in singeleuser mode to restore things - and probably will not get any help, because here are only few users with Tiger./strong  I was thinking about this post and maybe would be better write nothing - because of the dangerous command. But, on the other side - if you do things carefully (google for Netinfo), you can easily done your problem.  Be careful - good luck. ;)  <answer15877> So, I finally managed to have a working version of homebrew, but it wasn't that simple.  First, download from sources and make install of Git following these instructions.  Then, using git, get the sceaga Tiger branch of Homebrew.  All should then work correctly (more or less).  strongEDIT/strong There seems to be a tarball hidden somwhere that could be used with root installation procedure. It has the obvious interest of avoiding one to install git just for the sake of having a running homebrew to ... install another git version.  <answer21831> Here is the single-step install of Homebrew on Tiger PPC:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSLk https://raw.github.com/gist/1144389/5723f23d03c49912ffd460d32e958e71d7e0cd67/install_homebrew.rb)" /code/pre  It installs sceaga's Tiger branch, precisely the one you quote aboveâ€¦br I've just forked the former install_homebrew.rb and modified it in order to work under Tiger PPC.br You can review my code here  <answer77160> strongTigerbrew/strong: homebrew forked for Tiger PPC  Tigerbrew incorporates work from sceaga's Tiger branch. It installs under the admin group, so you don't have to add yourself to the staff group.  strongInstallation/strong:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/go)" /code/pre  And here is a link for downloading Xcode:  https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_2.5_developer_tools/xcode25_8m2558_developerdvd.dmg  <comment16786> Can you even obtain a copy of Xcode that will run on your system? <comment16919> Have I been somehow unclear ? I guess so. let me clarify a point : Tiger has not the `dscl` command, but `nicl`, which is its ancestor. <comment16921> but AFAIK have the NetInfo Manager... or no? <comment16932> Yes, I have, but I don't even have the slightest begin of understanding of how it works. <comment16934> ok, later will delete my answer - i only want point you to one app, with witch is possible do most of OS X specific config things (users, groups, mounts, sharing) etc - but it is removed from the Leopard, so i can't "navigate" you, what to do... <comment133615> I would like to get the Tiger Homebrew, but the links below are no longer working. Can someone update a post or provide a new answer please?
