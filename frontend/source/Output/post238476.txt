Cannot create new user in Single-user mode <body> I try to create new user using the following commands:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /sbin/mount -uw / launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist dscl . -create /Users/username /code/pre  But after the last command I get the error code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist: No such file or directory/code. Actually, I get it on every launch of codedscl/code command, even without any arguments. How can I fix it?  <answer238478> It turned out that this error can be just ignored, because the user is properly created anyway.  <comment292481> Nice, mark it as solved when possible.
