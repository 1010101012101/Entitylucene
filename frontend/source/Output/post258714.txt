Early 2011 macbook pro - el capitan - No corestorage logical volume groups found <body> So right now my hard drive is not working as it should. I was running bootcamp on el capitan and decided to use parallels with the bootcamp partition.  This screwed up the bootcamp partition and I got a "boot device not found" screen when trying to boot windows. I removed the bootcamp partition and tried to reinstall, several times.   As soon as i rebooted windows the next time i booted up the same "boot device not found" screen would pop up. After trying to reinstall several times the bootcamp partition disappeared, and the space as well.  I have been looking around for a solution to recover the lost partiotion space and found this:   Resizing Macintosh HD partition to use free space  however when i use "diskutil cs list" "No corestorage logical volume groups found" comes up.  Here is the diskutil list:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0     1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1     2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            299.2 GB   disk0s2     3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             200.5 GB   disk0s3 /code/pre
