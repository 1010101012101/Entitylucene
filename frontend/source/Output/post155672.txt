Imac not start, wirless keyboard reset <body> I have a problem with an IMAC 27'  1: the osx was corupt so it wasn't boot anymore. 2: i changed the batery from the keyboard so, i canot use the keyboard for startup key combination to reinstal the operating sistem  All i want to do is to reinstal the operating sistem (i have the original cd) but i can not do anything. any command i try to do on startup, dosn't work because the keyboard was reset (i think). I put the cd in and now i can not eject because ... guess what... the keyboard not work, of course.  so, what can i do?   thank you very much  <answer155684> Thee is nothing you can do with wireless keyboard at this time.  Get a USB cable keyboard, from friend or from store.  <comment183146> Borrow a wired keyboard; even a Windows one will do,  the windows key will act as Command, iirc. <comment183172> thank you so much. i will try this
