How to monitor the network usage of specific apps on iOS? <body> I am currently helping someone who has experienced large amounts of data being transferred over her DSL connection. After long research (via IRC support) I found out that her iPhone is obviously sending lots of data, i.e. several hundred kbyte/s, as soon as she connects it to her home network. The iPhone itself seems to work fine.  To find the culprit responsible for these huge amounts of data I would probably need to find a way to measure how much data all connected applications are sending within a specific interval.  As I do not use an Apple mobile device myself I am not familiar with iOS. Are there any possibilities to get information about the network usage of specific apps, either natively or with the help of a third-party application that is for free or at least offers a free trial version?  <answer127897> You can do this with strongOnavo Count/strong     Onavo Count monitors and analyzes all types of mobile data and phone use. This includes background, foreground, and Wi-Fi use.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mZuq7.png" alt="Onavo Count"   <answer131419> iOS can do this natively under network usage. Just reset the stats with the bottom button and review later.  Go under Settings  Cellular and scroll down. You will see what each app installed on her device uses as far as data. (This is on iOS 7)  <comment252893> For previous versions, go Settings  General  Usage  Cellular Usage <comment275037> This app is no longer available from the UK or US app stores. <comment275038> This option is labelled "Mobile data" in the UK. It's not much use for apps that only use WiFi though :-( <comment278275> Please ask for this feature at Apple so they'll consider adding it. The more people that ask the more likely it will get added http://www.apple.com/feedback/
