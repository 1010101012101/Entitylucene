Why does my iPad automatically capitalise Bono but not the edge? <body> Can anyone please tell me why my iPad automatically capitalises "Bono" but not "the edge"?  <answer147782> English is hard.  One is easily distinguishable as a proper noun. Bono is not a common word that would be anything other than a name. Like Sally or Andreas. The OS can capitalize occurrences of Bono with a high degree of confidence that you were referring to a proper noun.  The other is not easily distinguishable as a proper noun. There is no way to tell if the sentence:     I played guitar near the edge   is referring to you playing guitar near a precipice or near another human who has the legal name Dave Evans.  You can create a text shortcut to automatically expand a text snippet you enter like codetedge/code to codeThe Edge/code if you like. You can find shortcuts in the Settings app under codeGeneral &gt; Keyboards &gt; Shortcuts/code.  <comment174306> FWIW, it doesn't get Larry Mullen jr right either â€” it capitalizes Larry Mullen but not the Jr., and it doesn't auto-add the comma. Adam Clayton comes out just fine. <comment174367> I think you just answered this conundrum pro bono. <comment174396> @DanielLawson but everyone knows they're not *really* in the band anyways so that's okay. :) <comment180534> Weird, I found that shortcut had automatically downloaded to my phone...
