Macbook Pro doesn't recognise ANY HDD <body> h2The Issue/h2  The Macbook refuses to boot from internal disk. Disk Utility recognises it emsometimes/em, however, is unable to format it. Linux is, however, able to both recognise and format the disk.  h2What I've tested/h2  ul liPerforming SMC reset. Made Disk Utility at least see the HDD./li liPerforming Apple Hardware Test. No issues found./li liUsing a SATA to USB adapter to a Macbook Air 2014. It could format and access the drive (Even offering to use it as a Time Machine.). Tried installing El Capitan from that Macbook, however, the installation did strongNOT/strong succeed./li liSwitching the disk out, however, this gave same results and even made Mac OS X strongNOT/strong recognise the disk at all, even after SMC reset./li liFormatting the disk to HFS+ on another computer, then skipping formatting on the Macbook and going directly to installation. The Macbook did strongNOT/strong recognise the partition./li liInstalling Linux (Ubuntu Gnome). The installation strongDID/strong succeed. Ended up with a flashing question mark after reboot though. The system is there however, and the disk is mountable and the files are accessible./li liTried switching the SATA cable as well, with one found in a 2009 Macbook Pro 13 inch. It did manage to boot the disk from the 2009 Macbook, However, no other disk./li /ul  h2Additional notes/h2  The Macbook strongDID/strong manage to boot Linux from the disk strongONCE/strong, and never again. Also, sometime this weird blue window about a MOK key appears asking for a certificate of some sort. Apparently this has something to do with secure boot (I think).  h2Conclusion/h2  Either it's the HDD or the SATA cable. Or both. However, this doesn't explain why it managed to boot once and never again, and also why Linux detects the disk and can write to it while Mac OS X can detect it but not use it, and why the BIOS doesn't detect it at all and refuses to boot from it.  h2Device/h2  Macbook Pro 2011  ul li13 Inch/li lii5 model/li liUnknown amount of RAM/li liStandard 500GB HDD/li liCondition - pretty bad (scuffs, scratches, missing command-key)/li /ul  <comment295653> Did you try running Apple Hardware Test (AHT)?  Hold "D" key while booting from a powered off state and AC adapter connected.  I am pretty certain that you logic board is shot. <comment295665> AHT said 'No trouble found.' <comment295666> Did you do "extended tests" as well? <comment295667> Yes I did both regular and extended <comment295669> You may need to do some in depth diagnosis only a tech can do.  I suggest taking it in.
