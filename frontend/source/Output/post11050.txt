MDS Error: /var/folders/lM <body> I've been getting this error coming up in my system log.  Having looked around for an answer, two things came up commonly: a problem with the spotlight database(s), and permissions on those folders.  Well, I played with permissions and even deleted some of the folders in question to see if they would be re-created properly.  I think that was a mistake, there were odd side effects, so I tried my best to restore the folders to the way they had been previously.  Also, resetting MDS didn't help much.  Most recently the error comes up when Outlook refuses to get my mail properly.  It's also always followed by Quicklook-related errors as well. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3xtnB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer11085> From Apple Support Communities, with some correction:  ul likbdCommand/kbd-kbdS/kbd at startup for Single User Mode/li liRepair the files ystem as indicated on screen using codefsck/code (took three runs)/li liMount the file system as indicated on screen, code/sbin/mount -uw //code/li liGo to code/Library/Caches/code and do coderm -rf */code/li liGo to my home folder /Users/.../Library/Caches and do coderm -rf */code/li liRemove a Spotlight folder, coderm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/code/li liGo to code/var/folders/code and do coderm -rf */code/li liStart normally using codeexit/code or codereboot/code command as indicated on screen/li /ul  Be strongextremely careful/strong with the coderm -rf/code commands!

I may just do a quick backup and try it tho.  Results coming later today.  :-) <comment11595> Also - I believe single-user mode is cmd+s, not cmd+opt+s.  Wonder when that post was written, I seem to remember it used to be +opt way back when... <comment11635> Well crap.  This seems to have worked.  I don't know which step I missed last time I tried this, but I can't deny the results.  Thank you!
