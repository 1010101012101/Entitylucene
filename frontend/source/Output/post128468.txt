How to prevent octave from spawning in a new Terminal window? <body> I run octave in Terminal but whenever I use the codeOctave/code command to start octave (from an existing terminal session) or select Octave in Mission Control, it starts a new Terminal window. I find this behaviour annoying.  How can I make octave run in my current Terminal window?  <answer128776> I'll take a shot at answering your question...  It sounds like your current strongOctave/strong app is more or less a convenient wrapper for the scripts and such that you would otherwise have to run from the terminal to get things up and running. In other words, it's created for people that are trying to emavoid/em interacting with the terminal directly (and since you seem to emenjoy/em working directly from the command line, the app has lost a lot of its convenience).    Anyway, in my opinion (for what it's worth) your best bet is to ditch the Octave app and instead take a more hands-on approach and install strongOctave/strong via a package manager like strongHomebrew/strong (here are some instructions you can follow).  However, a quick warning: Installing octave this way is occasionally a real pain-in-the-neck (and same goes for getting strongOctave/strong to work with strongGNUplot/strong). Though the links I've provided emshould/em be enough to help you get strongOctave/strong set up the way you want, the installation process itself is not always, well, particularly pleasant (after all, those "emconvenience wrappers/em" exist for a reason). Just giving you a heads-up...  Hope this helps!   Another helpful tutorial which is similar to the first link.br And still another (the title of this post is pretty revealing...).  <answer141136> The actual script that executes when the new Terminal window is opened can be found at /usr/local/octave/3.8.0/bin/octave-3.8.0.  This path will be different for different versions of Octave.  To have this script run when you run the octave command, create a symbolic link to something like /usr/local/bin/octave (assuming /usr/local/bin is on your path).    The command to run this would be something along the lines of:  precodesudo ln -sf /usr/local/octave/3.8.0/bin/octave-3.8.0 /usr/local/bin/octave /code/pre  <comment150435> How do you run it? Little more details please. <comment150436> Do you use a .command file? <comment150473> @Rob I start it by command "Octave" in terminal (already copied the app into bin folder), or by choosing from Spotlight or Alfred. They all end up in a new terminal window. <comment150474> @DonyorM I don't really know what is a .command file? <comment150554> A .command file is a shell script that can be double clicked and automatically run. I don't know much about Octave, but I know if I use a .command file it always opens a new wind. What kind of program is octave? <comment150556> @DonyorM It's like a open-source version of Matlab, runs in command line or GUI. <comment150832> How did you install Octave - How do you start from Mission Control - don't you mean Desktop?
