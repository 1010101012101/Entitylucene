How to configure browser used by web page Reminders? <body> How can I change which browser the Mac Reminders.app uses to open "this webpage" associations for a Reminder, so I can change the "Open Google Chrome Canary" notification button to an "Open Mozilla Firefox" button?  Given I've created a Reminder for a Webpage on my phone by asking Siri to "remind me about this tomorrow", when the Reminder appears on my laptop running the latest public build of OS X, then I expect the Open button to offer to open it in my default browser, or just not mention the browser and behave as codeopen(1)/code does.  Instead, what I see is "Open in Google Chrome Canary":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQwg6.png" alt="enter image description here"  This has me flummoxed: I open that browser like once a year, and my default browser is Mozilla Firefox. I've no clue why Reminders has latched onto it as The Chosen Browser for webpage reminders.  strongETA:/strong I have deleted Google Chrome Canary. After relaunching Reminders.app, webpage reminders show, instead of its icon, the "invalid app" default icon with slashed-circle. Clicking that button does nothing. No console logs appear.   <answer261651> Try deleting these files:  ul licode~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Chrome.plist/code/li licode~/Library/Preferences/com.google.Keystone.Agent.plist/code/li licode~/Library/Saved Application State/com.google.Chrome.savedState/code/li licode/private/var/folders/5g/h3jsl4892418tz23ttcms4p80000gn/C/com.google.Chrome/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/com.google.Keystone.Agent/code/li licode~/Library/Caches/Google/Chrome/code/li licode~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.google.keystone.agent.plist/code/li licode~/Library/Google/Google Chrome Brand.plist/code/li licode~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/code/li /ul  Not sure which one, but one of those fixes the problem. And removing them all will remove all of the files that Chrome installs in your system. I'm using MacPaw's CleanMyMac 3 to do this automatically.  <comment327624> Can't believe there's no answer/fix for this yet. :( <comment329150> Some time later, it went from no browser to regular Chrome as the browser used to open reminders. I don't actually want to delete Chrome: I just don't want it to be the browser used to open webpage reminders!
