Unknown Menu poping up <body> I'm very new to Lion and I somehow managed to make a special menu appear when I was holding my fingers on the trackpad (like a long click).   It's round and I have never ever seen it before. I was using Leopard before so maybe the feature is known to Snow Leopard users.   I have never ever seen it before and I actually don't know how to activate it. It just comes up randomly sometimes. One instance was while I was browsing and trying to mark some text, like it was always working (you can't mark text anymore with a double tap+hold - mouse move). What I noticed though, is that it has something to do with a long click and movement.   What menu is this?  <comment42603> A screenshot would be appreciated. Try look for any new processes in Activity Monitor and the shortcut keys for Keyboard. This could be an unwanted app. <comment42624> You can perhaps try to replicate the action. Here's a guide to all of the trackpad's gestures under Lion: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4721 <comment42633> Since i can't replicate the action, I can't provide a screenshot. It looks like a blue circle with an arrow in it with a white border and it's not on that page. This page was the first thing I was looking at when I asked myself this. Since it's not shown anywhere as a new feature I think this is a feature that has been there for some time now.
