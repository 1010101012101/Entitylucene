How do I keep from activating facetime while on a call <body> When making a call my cheek hits the screen and turns on facetime etc.   How do I stop this?  <answer128514> Actually once the phone is answered or ringing just hit the lock button on the top of the phone. It should still continue to operate as a phone but you have locked out the screen.  <answer128517> Modern touchscreen phones have a proximity sensor, that emits IR light and measures the bounce back from nearby objects (if any). It's meant to detect your phone's proximity to your face. Perhaps you have a malfunctioning proximity sensor that's never detecting your face.  Does your screen go black when you cover the top (from the top of the display and up) with a finger?  <comment150533> Unless you're on speaker phone or have headphones plugged in, pressing the power button will hang up the call. <comment255083> I've having the same problem as the OP, but it only started after upgrading to iOS 9 and I've had the same iPhone for two years... never happened to me under iOS 7 or 8.
