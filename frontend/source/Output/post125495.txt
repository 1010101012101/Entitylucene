Change Google Chrome settings without user intervention <body> I need a way to change settings in Google Chrome for all my users. Ideally, I would place this in the login script or manage it by MCX.  Specifically, I need to disable part of Autofill, "Include addresses from my Address Book card". I would like to leave the rest of the feature on.  I searched for preferences files, Chrome policies, MCX manifests and command line options. Is this possible at all?
