External SanDisk 64GB USB doesn't mount or seem to have a file system <body> I recently bought a SanDisk 64 GB USB.  It will not mount and doesn't reformat as there are no partitions/no file system.  I'm not sure how to fix this.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ENT0A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment353316> Does it appears in Disk Utility (found in /Applications/Utilities)? If yes you can just select the drive and erase it to initialize it. <comment353320> The name *Anisha* and the size of 67 MB suggest that it is broken.

You will find several SanDisk related results with some methods to restore/create a partition - a lot of them weren't successful though <comment353538> @klanomath Ohh ok so other people have had this issue - thanks for bringing that to my attention.
