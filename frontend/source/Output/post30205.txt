How do I split a Bootcamp Partition on a second drive? <body> I have a Mac Mini Server 2011, which has 2 Hard disks of 750GB  each. I want to install Windows 7 on the second disk, but i want to split this disk on two partitions: One of 450 GB for Windows and one of 300 GB with exFat to share data between Windows and OS X (is Lion by the way).   I tried with the Bootcamp assistant, but it took for the Bootcamp partition the whole disk, and so I installed that way, but I prefer to have both partitions as I mentioned above.  Can I split it the way I want? I don't mind if I have to reinstall Windows as long as I have the best compatible solution for this.  <answer30206> Should work without problems, but didn't try: Open Disk Utility. Create two partitions, an exFAT-partition and a mac-partition. Then, start bootcamp assistant and use the mac partition to install windows.  <answer32947> Open Disk Utility and format second HDD with Partition Map Scheme to be Master Boot Record. Then start up from Windows Install Disk by pressing Alt or C and create partitions from there.  You should probably use Bootcamp Assistant before (or after) just to save Windows drivers and Bootcamp taskbar utility to the flash disk or elsewhere.  <comment34656> This doesn't work. On boot camp assistant, when I choose the disk, the only available options are: "Erase disk and create a single partition for Windows" and "Restore Disk to Single Mac OS Partition" <comment34658> Did you try resizing the windows partition in Windows 7 (rightclick on computer - Manage - Disk Manager), rebooting to Mac OS and creating the exFAT partition in disk utility? As far as I read from [a guide on macrumors](http://guides.macrumors.com/Extend/Resize_Boot_Camp_Partition) this should be possible. <comment34661> With the Disk Manager in Windows you can't resize an existing partition. You can delete them, and make new ones, but no resize them. <comment34664> @DkAngelito you're wrong, since XP you can make them bigger, since Vista also shrink it. <comment34667> Well, I didn't know that I could shrink a partition in the Device Manager. I'll try it and let you know. <comment34674> Nope, I didn't work. After shrinking the partition and rebooting Windows fails to load. Any other suggestion ? <comment34700> I guess that's something with the partition table synchronization. One more idea: create two NTFS partitions while installing windows and reformat one (in windows) to exFAT before rebooting to Mac. <comment34885> i Can't create two partitions. If I delete the bootcamp partition, Windows will not boot (Its in the boot camp manual and i have test it).
