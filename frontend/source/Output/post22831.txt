Is there a way to make Windows-style SMB share paths launch correctly? <body> We have a mixed Windows/Mac network, with Windows fileservers, and an Exchange/Outlook mailsystem.  The Windows users send out emails with links to the shared files that look like:  precode\\FileServer01\topfolder\subfolder\shared.doc /code/pre  If you right-click on the link in Mac Outlook 2010, it seems to have a pseudo-URL of:  precodefile://///FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc /code/pre  Mac Outlook 2010 makes that link clickable, but fails with an error:  precodeThe file ///FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc could not be found. /code/pre  Given that we're not going to be able to get people to stop copy-pasting in Mac-unfriendly SMB links, is there any way to get the Finder or some handler to rewrite the URL into something the Mac can open?  <answer22836> Short answer: no.  Long answer:  Maybe, if Outlook support plugins or something.  Macs will refer to a Samba server share as smb://Server/Share/Subfolder/File.ext.  What you emcould/em do - copy the link, minus the junk at the beginning, so that you have something like this in your clipboard - "FileServer01/topfolder/subfolder/shared.doc".  Switch to finder, hit cmd+k, paste, move to the beginning of the line and type smb://, hit enter.  It will drop down to the last folder before the "shared.doc".  Not elegant, not pretty, but it works.  And for now it may just be your only option, sorry.  <answer22864> I'm in a similar position at work, with a mixed environment. We use WinShortcutter, which is freeware. The allows you to right-click on a UNC path (such as code\\FileServer01\topfolder\subfolder\shared.doc/code) and Open as Windows Link: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/guqh3.jpg" alt="WinShortcutter - Open as Windows Link"  It's quite configurable as well, and allows drive mappings (so when you are sent a link that starts codeS:/folder/code, it will allow you to Open as Windows Link). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rvm9F.jpg" alt="WinShortcutter - Configuration"  This works quite reliably for us.  <answer101788> In 10.8 there is functionality to do this built-in... so in a sense your wishes have been granted provided you can migrate to the newer operating systems. I can imaging the support for this will only get better with 10.9.  <answer134459> I was using 10.8 and have been sending links from my pc to our mac user as such---  smb://video/videoshare/folder/    Originally I was sending them   \\video\videoshare\folder\   --- This would still work, they would have to perform a right click then select open url and it would open the location.  Now we are on 10.9.3 and the ablilty to open a samba network link in outlook 2010 seems to have vanished without a trace.  I send it the way I have been for mac users and now they can't click on the link to open.   They have to do a right click and then open url and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.   <comment25463> Mac Outlook doesn't support plugins. I was thinking maybe of registering a new URL handler that took over the "file://" schema, but seems errorprone. Really, I'm trying to solve it with tech for a non-tech audience. Something we can just install and it'll map it right. <comment25553> Nice! Seems to work pretty well. One note - the Service wasn't available to add in the Keyboard-Service System Prefs until a reboot. <comment119918> Could you elaborate? What did OSX 10.8 add with respect to what was asked? <comment142404> Did you get this to work? Mapping "file://..." to "smb://..." so we can just click on the network server links and have them open in Finder? <comment159142> Hi and welcome to Ask Different.
