How to find a .peg file on iPhone? <body> I found this problem showing up on El Capitan Photos.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KbuvG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Does anybody know how to find the .peg file?  Additionally, I think this error is related to why some of my photos are not being imported into Photos. Has anybody else experienced the same problem?  <answer213927> My guess is that you should rename it to .jpg and then try again.  <answer216632> I think, but I am not sure that strong.PEG/strong files on iPhone is the container for strongGoogle Snapseed/strong when you strongsave a modified image/strong and want to preserve original to make modifications (strongnon deterioring editing/strong).  <comment291584> I don't think he'll be able to change the photo if he can't find it. His post asks how to find it. Suggesting that he change it before he finds it won't get him far. I have the same problem. <comment314916> I believe you're right. Here's a link to a discussion about these .peg files on Snapseed's forum: https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/snapseed/GL_UUhRByQQ
