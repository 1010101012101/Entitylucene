Switching between Chrome Developer Tools and main window full screen <body> I'm running OS X 10.5.5 Yosemite. What's the shortcut to switch between Chrome Developer Tools (Cmd + Alt + J) and the main Chrome browser window, when both are full screen?  Cmd + ` doesn't work.  The Developer tools seems to register as another instance of Chrome running, so Application switching doesn't work either.  Thanks!  <answer207592> You can use Mission Control (kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdUp/kbd) to drag the main Chrome window and the DevTools window to adjacent emspaces/em, if they are not already next to each other. You can use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdRight/kbd to cycle through spaces.  Mac users will generally keep all related spaces adjacent to each other, in a group, and use kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdRight/kbd to navigate between them.
