How I can move the clock to the middle of the menu bar? <body> How I can move the clock, by default at the far right side of the menu bar, to the middle of the menu bar?  <answer83057> Holding kbdCommand/kbd and clicking, and then dragging should do it.   <answer83066> Unfortunately for you, the answer is: you can't. The way the Mac OS X Menu Bar is set up, Application Menus get added starting in the left hand corner (after the Apple menu) and going right; System and 3rd party Menu Extras get added from the right hand corner and go left. There's no way to absolutely position a menu on the menu bar; you can only change the order of the items.  As Tony mentioned in his answer, the user can reorder Menu Extras by dragging them while holding kbdCommand/kbd. Only the developer of an app can reorder the Application's menus. But there's no way to position anything in the center.  <comment95741> Doesn't really put in center. <comment96050> Really is no way? Even non trivial? <comment96067> There really is no way to position a Menu Extra in the middle of the menu bar. It is possible you might find a third party clock application which you can get to display the time there, but it won't be a Menu Extra. There's no way to position Menu Extras (Like the built in clock which displays in the menu bar) in the middle.
