Repeat on iOS music app <body> I have an iPhone 5. I have the latest software update of iOS 10.0.2. How can I repeat a Playlist and song?  Many thanks.  <answer255235> While a song is playing, pull up to reveal both the list of next titles and two buttons to enable/disable shuffle and to set the playlist or title to repeat.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fRfI3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
