Keyboard not functioning correctly for MAC Pro in Oracle Database Virtual Box Appliance <body> I'm trying to use the Oracle Database Virtual Box Appliance. The problem is that my keyboard is not functioning correctly. I can't find the ';' character, or the '@' character, for example. The command key and the alt key don't function properly. The 'e' opens a new terminal... I'm completely lost. Can anyone tell me how to be able to use the command and alt key? Thank you.
