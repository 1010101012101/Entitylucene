How do I create a new iCloud account for my daughter's iPad? <body> Two middle school daughters with new iPads (had to purchase for school). I will keep my AppleID on them for apps and music but want to create their own iCloud accounts for their photos, school work etc. How do I create a new account?  <answer95058> Here is the official Apple guide:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2731?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  If you get stuck somewhere in between just ask.  <comment140543> If @b4d's answer resolved your question, remember to mark it as the solution :)
