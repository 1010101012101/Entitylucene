How to delete iBooks.app <body> Is there any way to delete apps that were added by Apple in the Mavericks 10.9 update? In particular, I'm talking about iBooks.app. When I try to delete it, OS X tells me that it can't be because it's required by OS X.  <answer150284> ol liKill bookstoreagent/li liRemove the following files/folders:  ul licode/Applications/iBooks.app//code/li licode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ibooks.plist/code/li licode/private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.iBooksX//code/li licode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iBooksX//code/li /ul/li /ol  <answer187600> close iTunes  via strongterminal.app/strong  precodesudo killall bookstoreagent sudo tar -czf /Applications/iBooks.tar.gz /Applications/iBooks.app sudo rm -fr /Applications/iBooks.app /code/pre  keeps you a working backup, just in case you need it back:  precodecd /Applications sudo tar -xzf /Applications/iBooks.tar.gz /code/pre  there is no need to alter any other files, nor to play with LaunchAgents or Daemons. Once the App is gone, iTunes gains back the books functionality. I read some evil suggestions on the interwebs.  <comment176890> Uninstalling iBooks and moving Books back to iTunes? http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1660388&highlight=ibooks You have to Kill the bookstoreagent service before you can get rid of the App. <comment176891> @WayfaringStranger Thank you. That worked. <comment221796> maybe you should provide warnings and explain what those do.
