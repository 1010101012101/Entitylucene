Combine two bash find commands <body> I have two similar codefind/code commands that I basically have the same code for both once the while loop begins. I want to combine them so I only need one codefind/code to search through files and directories, instead of one to search directories and one to search files. Here are the two that I want to combine into one line:   precodefind "$ORIG_DIR" -name "*" -type d | while read dname  find "$ORIG_DIR" -name "*" -type f | while read fname /code/pre  <answer118020> You can provide multiple code-type/code options with code-o/code, such as code-type d -o -type f/code in a single command.  precodefind "$ORIG_DIR" -name "*" -type d -o -name "*" -type f | while read file /code/pre  supcode-o/code matches all parameters, so the code-name/code is provided twice in the above command./sup  <answer118021> You can use the test command to see whether it is a file or a folder:  precodefind "$ORIG_DIR" | while read thing; do     if [[ -d "$thing" ]]; then         # do whatever you want to do with the directory     fi     if [[ -f "$thing" ]]; then         # do whatever you want to do with the file     fi done /code/pre  <comment137760> @patrix Rewritten, now it doesn't re-traverse, and works :) <comment137763> For the `while` at the end, will this work: `while read dname; fname; do` work? <comment137765> `while read fame; do ... done`. Might be a good idea to google for "Shell Scripting Primer"
