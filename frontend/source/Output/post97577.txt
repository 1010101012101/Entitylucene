View the current clock Speed of a CPU in OS X? <body> Does anyone know of a utility to see the emcurrent/em speed of the processor?   To be clear, I'm not looking for the model/speed of the CPU, but rather what the CPU is currently clocked at (i.e. it will reduce speed if it overheats).  <answer97578> well there are two ways, if you want to see your processor load you can check activity monitor.   but if you want the actual frequencies here "Intel Power Gadget" is what you are looking for: (thank Yevgeni for the link)  (strongUPDATE: APP MAY NOT WORK PROPERLY ON NEWER LAPTOPS os x froze on yosemite)/strong  i just installed it to and it works GREAT  (side note, if you want super accurate readings, keep in mind, the intel application itself, uses some (altho minimal) power)  <answer97579> There is a tool that does that called IntelÂ® Power Gadget.  It will show the current load and Frequency  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UjsXF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer164585> If you open Activity Monitor (emApplicantions  Utilities  Activity Monitor/em), you can do two things to get a visual of current processor performance:  1) You can set the Dock icon to display the performance:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jYA2c.png" alt="Dock"  In Activity Monitor, go to emView  Dock Icon  Show CPU Usage/em. As a bonus, the performance bars are also shown while Option+Tab'ing through apps.  2) Go to emWindow  CPU History/em. This will display a floating window with CPU performance:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r2kHu.png" alt="History"  It can be set to to always stay on top of other windows too.  <comment114496> How current! it is variable pending the demand. <comment135822> fantastic official tool ! <comment183125> This doesn't work on the Mid 2013 MBA (and probably any other Haswell CPU architecture Mac) as you get an error when attempting to install the package file. The error states that your CPU is too old (when in fact, it appears to be too new!).  You can bypass the CPU check, but I don't take responsibility if it somehow does damage to your computer. To do it, right click the .mpkg file and "Show Package Contents". Navigate to /Contents/Resources and open cpu-check.sh with TextEdit. After the first line, add a new line "exit 1;" without the quotes. Save the file, and run the mpkg again. <comment188111> Works fine on the Mid 2014 rMBP. <comment193297> It's not a good idea to link to an old version of the app. Links break or get old all the time. <comment193339> was it old when i linked it? is the name absent? altho i get your point! <comment193361> All I know is that Intel had me download a `zip` file which contained the `dmg`. As such, the `dmg` link in the answer above can't be authoritative. FWIW, I upvoted your answer. <comment260648> When I clicked the link it directly downloaded the app, which is bad since - I want to know what I am downloading before downloading <comment260903> noted i will add it <comment297576> Those graphs show CPU usage, not clock speed (thus the downvotes) <comment333026> Intel Power Gadget worked OK for me on sierra with a 2015 MBP here...
