Boot Camp - running OS X partition as a VM <body> Now while many users know that it is possible to run a Windows Boot Camp partition as a VM under OS X via VMWare or Parallels - however is the opposite possible? That is, in my case - I would like to know if I can boot into Windows 8.1 on my Retina MBP then access my OS X partition as a VM.  <answer164146> ol liThere is a legal impediment to run Mac OS X on Non-Apple hardware [sic!]./li liVMware Player &amp; VMware Workstation therefore officially don't support the installation of Mac OS X on any hardware./li liBreaking several EULAs you might install a patch to circumvent this restriction (I will not provide a link for the patches)/li li     Then with Workstation and a patch, you can boot into your OS X partition from Windows.      But in order to access your macintosh HD partition first, you must create a blank OS X virtual machine.      Note that Macintosh HD here means your OS X partition in your internal hard drive./li   /ol   Source   I didn't test this! So a full Time Machine backup and a full Boot Camp-partition backup deems advisable.  <comment192352> Being booted into Windows and then running Mac OS in a virtual machine like he described would not violate Apple's EULA - the underlying hardware still has the Apple logo on the back.
