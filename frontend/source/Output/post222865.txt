Unable to delete Video on iPhone 5 <body> I recently transferred a video of around 1GB on my iPhone after synching it from iTunes. It's in my camera roll but I don't see Delete option available. However, I have 1 min video (other one) in my camera roll and I see delete option for that one. I want to delete this 1 GB video to free up some space. Anyone knows how to delete it?  <comment270097> is it greyed out or not visible? could it be that the sync stopped before finishing? <comment270098> Not visible. I got full video <comment270100> with which program on which OS did you sync it? Do you use the iCloud photo library? <comment270106> I sync it with iTunes on my Mac Yosmeti. I didn't use iCloud here.
