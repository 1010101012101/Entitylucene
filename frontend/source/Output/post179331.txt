Camera filters missing in iPhone 4s <body> I have an iPhone 4s. My camera doesn't have the live filters at the bottom right. I went to the settings, but it doesn't have anything that says "live filters".I'm very confused and want to know how to put them on my camera.  I don't want to go to my photos app and press edit. My friends has the same phone, and they have filters.  <answer179335> What version of iOS are you running? Live filters was added on iOS 7. If you haven't updated your iPhone to the latest (or, now, second-to-latest) major version of iOS, the "live" filters will not be available. You can check your iOS version by going into Settings  General  Software Update. But, be wary of updating to iOS 8 (which is now the version available to be upgraded to) many (though not all) iPhone 4s users have had issues with iOS 8.
