Removing Files from iTunes Media? <body> I noticed that I have well over 100 songs in the iTunes Media folder that are NOT in my actual iTunes. These would be songs that were loaded into iTunes then deleted because I didn't like them, want them, whatever. They are taking up hard drive space and I want to flush them out w/o having to go into each and every single folder and finding the songs that are not in my iTunes. I would have to sort through over 6,000 files to do that. There has to be an easier way! Thank you!  I wanted to add that I am using a PC (Windows 7) and not a MAC.  <answer73262> One of the many useful scripts in Doug's AppleScripts for iTunes is Music Folder Files Not Added, which will do exactly what you're looking for. Just download and run it, and it will give you a list of all files in your iTunes folders that aren't in the library.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tqbO7.png" alt="screenshot"  <comment85121> This is exactly what I need, but I failed to mention I am on a PC and it says it won't run on my system. <comment85250> Hi, has anyone found something like this that will work on a PC?
