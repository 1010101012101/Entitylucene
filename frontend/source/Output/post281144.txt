Getting bizarre error message from Mail <body> I have Mail set up to handle two different accounts: [my name]_iCloud, and [my name]_Gmail.   Today, when I try to send a message from the iCloud account, I get this message:  Can't Connect to the account "[my name]_iCloud". Enter the password for user "".  The message is exactly as I typed -- it does not provide the user name (which would've been [my name]@icloud.com). Just two quotation marks next to each other. Entering the iCloud password does nothing. It refuses to send any mail.  The iCloud account will strongRECEIVE/strong messages.  The Gmail account will both send and receive messages as usual.   Tried deleting the iCloud entries in keychain. Did not work.  Any suggestions on how to fix this?  <answer281290> For the record, the problem appears to have been resolved. Steps I took to fix:  (1) Delete everything from key chain (2) Remove gmail account from Mail. (3) Restore gmail to Mail.  Everything works again. For now.
