How to maintain focus on app window with AppleScript <body> I am trying to launch my scanner application using AppleScript.  I have it launching the Printer app and I know how to send the keystroke command but when the Printer window  opens it does not have focus in Finder so the keystroke I am sending is not working unless I already have the printer window open and in focus. How do I set the Finder focus to my window so it will hear the keystroke?  Here is my code:  precodetell application "System Events"   tell application "Canon MX510 series" to activate   key code 20 using command down end tell /code/pre  <answer143714> Try sending the Activate command outside the System Event tell, that would be the standard method.  precodetell application "Canon MX510 series" to activate my testAppRunning() tell application "System Events"         key code 20 using command down end tell  on testAppRunning()     set test to 0     repeat while test = 0         log test         tell application "System Events" to set test to count (every process whose name is "Canon MX510 series")         delay 2         --/*we do this even if active because it doesn't naturally come to front*/         try             tell application "Canon MX510 series" to activate         end try         if (test &gt; 0) then exit repeat     end repeat end testAppRunning /code/pre  <comment159780> Does the keystroke go to Finder or to Canon MX510 series? <comment169275> This makes no difference for me using Google Chrome (I do not have "Cannon MX510 series" installed). Putting `tell application "Google Chrome" to activate` inside the `tell application "System Events"` block or not still activates Chrome and sends the keystroke. <comment169294> Is that with it running already? I'm thinking if it's not it may need to check for when the process is running.. script tweaked to make sure app is running & frontmost... <comment169296> With Chrome not running, OP's code works
