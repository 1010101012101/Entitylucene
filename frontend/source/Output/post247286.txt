What can you and can't you do with an apple watch that has activation lock <body> My first question is what can you do and what can't you do with an apple watch with an activation lock.   My second question is how can I unpair the watch since the phone is a different location (I'm in South Africa and my brother is in New York with my phone). Is it possible to remove it from iCloud.com  I have to give the watch back to my work since I'm leaving but I can't unpair it. I also don't want to give them a watch with all my personal information on it.  <answer247289> strongTo answer your first question:/strong There are no limitations to having Activation Lock enabled on your Apple Watch, except for:     With Activation Lock, your Apple ID and password will be required before anyone can:      ul   liunpair your Apple Watch from your iPhone,/li   lior pair and use your Apple Watch with a new iPhone./li   /ul   em– the above taken from Apple's support site –/em  But I don't know if those are considered disadvantages.  strongAs for your second question,/strong you can unpair the Watch from the iPhone by:  ol liLaunching the codeSettings/code app on your Watch/li liSelect codeGeneral/code/li liTap codeReset/code/li liTap codeErase All Content and Settings/code/li liEnter your password, if needed/li liHit codeContinue/code/li /ol  <comment305128> Why does your work device have your personal files? <comment305139> How would I enter a password without the paired iPhone. <comment305140> @user1898829 You can just enter it on the Watch itself, correct? <comment305141> I'm not sure but if its an appleID password I doubt it since there are a range of characters in my password and theres no way to type on the watch. Since you said you can't unpair without appleID I'm guessing it is the appleID password. I have no passcode on my watch. <comment305142> @user1898829 Give it a try, see what happens. If it is the Apple ID password, we'll go from there.
