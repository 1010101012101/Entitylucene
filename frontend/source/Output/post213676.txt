How can I get Launchbar to show matching web bookmarks and history without typing a period? <body> I'm 99% certain that I used to be able to type a few letters and match the URL of an indexed bookmark file or web history and have those be valid results in Launchbar. If I type a few letters and then the period (for web address) then I get some matching results but I much prefer having matching websites appear along with files, services, contacts, etc.  What config am I missing?  <comment262700> I just installed launchbar myself and found out about the "index settings page". Did you check there if the option for indexing bookmarks and web history are turned on there?
