open -g command still opens application in the foreground <body> When I run the command codeopen -ga /Applications/Google_Chrome.app http://example.com/code the application behaves normally and opens the url in Chrome without bringing the application to the foreground.  But if I run the command codeopen -ga /Applications/Google_Chrome.app/code without specifying a url, the application opens in the foreground.   However running codeopen -ga /Applications/Safari.app/code works as expected and does not bring the application to the foreground regardless of whether a url is specified or not.   h3from the codeopen/code man pages/h3     strongcode-a application/code/strong   emcodeSpecifies the application to use for opening the file/code/em      strongcode-g/code/strong emcodeDo not bring the application to the foreground/code/em   Why is Chrome still opening in the foreground when the code-g/code option is passed? And how can I make it not do that?
