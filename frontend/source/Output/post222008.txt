Macbook Pro 2015 is turning off Wi-Fi every 30 seconds <body> I have a 2015 MacBook Pro 13 inch. When I play games such as "League of Legends" or "Dota 2", it turns off the Wi-Fi for 30 seconds and then turns it back on. This only happens to me when I play these games.  What is happening?  <comment268929> Are these network-connected games? What version of OS X (I assume ElCapitan) is installed? There's some info at this [LoL user site](http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/tips-tricks/PfyifKA2-mac-os-x-1011-el-capitan-lol) about El Capitan problems, which may be of help to you. <comment268931> @IconDaemon yes. This games is using network connecting. yes it is El Capitan. But I have mac mini and macbook air and there all works fine.
