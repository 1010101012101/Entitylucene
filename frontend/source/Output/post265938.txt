Clean Up by reverse added date order on Finder <body> In Finder I like to display items in icon view, I would like to keep this.  When I download something, I would like it to appear at the bottom on Finder. This is what generally happen.  But let's say I did a Clean Up by Name and after that I decided I want to Clean Up By date, with the most recent at bottom. Is it possible to do that?
