How can I disable ALL notifications in OSX Lion? <body> I need to disable all notifications: iCal, Skype, and especially application updates. Everything.  I can find info on how to do this in Yosemite, but not Lion.  Would anyone know how to go about this?  <answer224442> First of all, let's make sure that we are talking about Mac OS X "Lion" which is version 10.7 and not "Mountain Lion" which is version 10.8. Is this correct? This is important since Notification Center debuted in 10.8.  If you are on 10.7 then I may suggest two workarounds.  strong1./strong You may want to install Growl app and set all notifications off. Please, read Help and Blog sections before purchasing the app.  strong2./strong You may want to upgrade to "Mountain Lion" and then turn off all notifications by entering this commands in terminal:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  If you'll ever change your mind, you can then return it back by:  precodelaunchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist /code/pre  Hope this helps.
