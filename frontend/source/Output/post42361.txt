Save and restore data with command line <body> I will zip a file with a password. Then, I will write a script and ask:  precodeif (have the password saved) {    unzip file } else {     ask password     save password     unzip file } /code/pre  I want the user write only one time password in that computer. So what is the best program to save and restore a data. Use a file is too obvious, it will be a little more secure.   <answer42365> My AppleScript-fu isn't up to the task of providing you with the necessary code, but I think you're most likely to find the solution by leveraging the Keychain.  <answer47291> If I understand the question correctly, you want to have the user enter a password once, and store the input in a variable that can be reused later on in your script. You can do that like this:  precode# Let the user enter a password and store it in a variable called `$passw` read -p "Password: " passw # After that, you can use the variable `$passw` echo "$passw" # Delete the password variable at the end unset passw /code/pre  If you donâ€™t want to echo the password as the user types it, you can use:  precode# Let the user enter a password and store it in a variable called `$passw` echo "Password:" stty -echo read passw stty echo # After that, you can use the variable `$passw` echo "$passw" # Delete the password variable at the end unset passw /code/pre
