With Homebrew, how to check if a software/package is installed? <body> I'm installing a set of softwares/packages/formulas via homebrew with command like  precodebrew install &lt;formula1&gt; ... brew cask install &lt;formula2&gt; ... /code/pre  I wonder if it's a good idea to verify if the softwares code&lt;formula1&gt;/code, ..., code&lt;formula2&gt;/code, ... are already installed and only trigger the above commands for the ones NOT already installed. If so, how?  <answer284381> you could do something like this:   precodebrew list &lt;formula1&gt; || brew install &lt;formula1&gt; /code/pre  This will error on list and continue with install if not installed otherwise it will just list package files. (one could modify this further as a function or alias in .bashrc to make it easier to type)
