.abbu file I can't import or open <body> I have a .abbu file but I can't import it to by contacts. It brings them in and they disappear. I am running Yosemite 10.10.1 and contacts 9.0. Any ideas? Is there any way I could open the .abbu file in something else and convert to .csv? I have tried Numbers, Xcel, Word, BBEdit, Text Edit ... kind of lost.  Apple contacts was running mega-slow and I thought if I exported them and deleted the old files, then reported it might help.  <comment189659> Do you have the iCloud contacts enabled? Also, did you try to fix your contacts data base by at least doing the Look for duplicates?, supper slow could be due to the synchronization. <comment189661> By using "Select all" and followed by export as vCard you get a Excel type format, or use other app that can read that format.
