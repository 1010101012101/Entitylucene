Is there a way to fix MagicPrefs? <body> Sometimes if an app needs keychain access MagicPrefs blocks clicks in the allow/disallow dialog, here it is:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vfe7J.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ay9j4.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can click only "Deny" from there. And now if I force close MagicPrefs and try again it's all ok and I don't get any new errors in Console.  My question is how to make it not to block keychain?  <comment279646> Please do not add answers directly to the question.
