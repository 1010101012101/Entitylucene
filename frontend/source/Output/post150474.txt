Can't print in fast / draft when connected to printer over wifi, but can when connected via usb <body> I recently bought a Canon ix6850 printer to replace my Canon ix6500 (really the 6850 is just an updated version with built-in wifi). Now I've got this new 6850, if I connect to it over wifi I get the following the print setting. Note: draft is not an option.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XeQKF.png" alt="screen shot of print options 1"  But if I move my laptop next to the printer and connect via the usb cable I get the following. Any idea how I can enable draft when connecting over wifi?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gz34P.png" alt="screen shot of print options 2"  <answer150824> Judging from the swapping of the words "Media &amp; Quality" to "Quality &amp; Media" in each screenshot, I'd say that when you use the printer with USB, your computer selects a different "draft-able" driver. When the printer is accessed over Wi-Fi, another driver is used, which prohibits Draft mode printing for some reason.  <answer150879> I've seen different features when someone is using the airprint driver (which automatically gets assigned to the printer when WiFied) compared to the 'normal' driver via USB. It says if it's airprint or not in system prefsprint&amp;scan "Kind" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vdQQL.png" alt="Print &amp; scan, Kind"  You can choose what driver you want when you add the printer in the "use:" drop down. Try a couple. If as you say, the 6500 is the same but sans wifi then try the 6500 driver.  I mean these are just first steps. I haven't even gotten into gutenprint or messing with ppd's to add features/paper sizes to drivers that don't officially support them. CUPS is some cool tech.  <comment177550> it seems that way some of the print options are different also, do you know is there a way to specify which driver the printer uses and when ? <comment177599> The command 'lpadmin' is your friend here. You can specify everything you need to about the printer. If you want to do the same thing using a friendlier interface, enable the CUPS web administration page. Enter 'sudo cupsctl WebInterface=yes' in Terminal, enter your password when required, then go to your web browser and navigate to the URL 'http://localhost:631/admin', press Add Printer, and follow the prompts. Your printer drivers are located in /Library/Printers/PPDs/. <comment177662> Thanks - the use dropdown is very handy, it allows me to print on draft now.
