Virtual Box and single user install <body> I recently uninstalled a VirtualBox installation that was made available to all users using the provided tool. I went to re-install for a single user, but it will only let me install for all users, not single user or specific location. How can I resolve this problem?  I'm using a 2013 MacBook Pro with MacOS Sierra  <answer275986> You can't, I'm afraid. I filed a bug about this years ago, and it was closed as wontfix.  <comment347274> Any alternatives that do allow it? <comment347381> Not sure... I also use VMWare Fusion and it will certainly run from folders other than /Applications (e.g. ~/Applications), but I don't recall if there's an option to specify install location out of the box.
