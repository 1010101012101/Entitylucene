Show all services on right click <body> Whenever you have more than 4 services, they are put in a dropdown option "Services" on right click instead of just being added to the right click menu itself.  Is this an option somewhere that can be changed?  Thanks.  <answer80132> The little known emApple Services Manager/em, released via Mac OS X Automation, offers such a setting (bottom right of the main window), besides other service amenities like fine grained control over which service actually turns up in the menu.  <answer80219> Services Manager seems to just modify .GlobalPreferences.plist:  precodedefaults write -g NSServicesMinimumItemCountForContextSubmenu -int 999 /code/pre  You have to reopen applications to apply the changes.  <comment92471> Excellent, thank you for this! <comment92541> Thanks, always good to know the command as well. <comment92775> Apple and their secrets. Why, why. But I kinda like hunting things down. One had better, if you're an Apple fan!
