Skype hotkey for answering <body> As you know in new oS X yosemite we have built in notification system. Which is good. For instance, you can answer on Skype message from notification popup, without (almost) losing focus on current task. But problem is, you need to find trackpad or mouse to click on reply section in small popup window. It would be really great to have hotkey for that. Is it possible to get it with help AppleScript ? Or any other solution available ?  Thanks.
