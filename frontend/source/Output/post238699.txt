Add a BBC Podcast to iTunes <body> I used to subscribe to BBC podcasts by clicking on the 'Subscribe' icon and selecting iTunes/IOS - simple.  Now when I do it, the programme opens up Winamp and nothing is added to iTunes.  Has something changed?  Should I be directing this question to the BBC?  I am just using my PC and Windows 7, nothing fancy.   <answer238729> It sounds like Winamp has claimed podcast/RSS feeds, coderss:///code, on your computer. This means when an podcast/RSS feed is clicked, Winamp is launched rather than iTunes.  The BBC's Podcast help suggests copying and pasting the podcast link directly into iTunes:     h2Subscribing using iOS, Android or Window/h2      Select your operating system. Once you have installed your chosen   software simply click on the relevant button and the software will do   the rest.      h2Subscribe using a feed reader/h2      Clicking on RSS will take you to the actual podcast feed page.      Some browsers may display instructions at the top of the page in which   case simply follow them.      Or, you can copy and paste the feed URL into a new feed in your   podcast software or feed reader - just look for buttons or links   marked "Add feed" or "Subscribe".   <comment292789> This is really a windows question - how to open a download (or a rss: protocol description) in another program so better on SuperUser. <comment293402> Thanks Graham, but I wanted to avoid having to do it manually.  As I said, It used to work, but doesn't any longer.  I have now found out how to do it from within iTunes, so am a hapy bunny again.  Thanks for your time.
