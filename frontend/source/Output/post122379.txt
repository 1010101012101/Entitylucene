How to update 10.4.11 OS X? <body> Is there a way to update 10.4.11 OS X to the newest version of OS X? I have Mac Pro (2 x 2 GHz Dual-Core Intel Xeon with 1 GB ram).   <answer122383> You'll have to at least buy Snow Leopard to upgrade. You can buy it from the Apple Store for $20, and then the upgrade from that to Mavericks is free.  <answer122434> Check the specifications of your mac. It appears that you are running a MacPro1,1. This machine will only upgrade as far as Lion (10.7). If your machine isn't listed it can't run it. You would also need to add RAM.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5842  <comment142820> Mavericks system requirements are at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5842
