iPhone 5 auto-complete Messages <body> I have a small issue, every time I type in "and", auto-complete changes that to "shut the fk up". I've searched all around and even reset in Settings - General - Keyboard reset  Anyone else have this issue?  <answer84195> Go to Settings-General-Keyboard. And see if you have 'and' defined in the shortcuts.   <comment96859> Yes! Someone is messing with you as it would be very hard to "train" the spelling engine to perform that bizarre of a substitution.
