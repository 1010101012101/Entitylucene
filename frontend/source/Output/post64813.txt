Mounting Ext3 filesystem with OS X 10.7.4 <body> I'm trying to mount an Ext3 external USB hard drive in OS X 10.7.4. I installed OSXFUSE (with macfuse compability layer), which worked fine. After that I tried to install EXT2FS but the install processs always aborted.  Any ideas?  <answer70774> Have a look at this open source project: fuse-ext2. This link:  http://blog.applegrew.com/2011/12/access-ext3ext2-file-system-on-mac-osx-lion-10-7/  explains how to configure fuse-ext2 and OSXFuse on OS X 10.7 "Lion" to get access to ext3-formatted drives.  (The project is tagged beta and inactive since 1 year (last commit on Aug 15 2011), but according to the link above it is compatible with "Lion". You only will get read-only access, read/write is not ready for prime time...)  Another possibility, as linked by emkopischke/em in his comment, is a commercial solution called Paragonâ€™s ExtFS driver. It's not clear from the feature list whether ExtFS driver works on OS X 10.7 "Lion", so if you decide to go this way be sure to find out before purchasing it.  Other projects, like Ext2 for Mac OS X or ext2 filesystem in user space are either tagged inactive or alpha.  <answer128469> I have successfully used Paragon's ExtFS driver in OS X Mavericks (and Mountain Lion previously) with full read/write access. This has worked for me with ext3 and ext4 file systems.  My only concern would be if you are mounting your Linux root (or any other system root) and you are therefore able to touch sensitive files (code/etc//code comes to mind) that may stop working (Linux does not boot, etc) if the wrong permissions get applied. The solution to this is to mount read-only but I cannot say that Paragon's software really has that as a built-in option. The default mode (as is with OS X in general, except for the built-in NTFS driver) is read/write.  Also, do not expect performance in any case. I tried to use my external drive with iTunes and the performance was intolerable.  <comment81246> If your question is about how to mount an ExtFS file system, check [this possible duplicate](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/29842/11948). <comment150453> Are you looking to solve the abort or remove osx fuse or perhaps something else?
