mac osx lion security configuration guide <body> I could find the security configuration guide for mac osx versions at http://www.apple.com/support/security/guides/ however, I can't find any for OS X Lion. Any one know if it is in the works or if it is moved else where?  <answer34544> Correct.  They're sadly slow to publish this info.
