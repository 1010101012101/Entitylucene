How to prevent OSX Mail PDF export to split sentences (horizontally) at the end of the page? <body> When I export an email to a .pdf file in Mac OSX 10.9.5 it often splits sentences horizontally:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XZW5t.png" alt="enter image description here"  This also happens with images. Is there a way to prevent this (e.g. to push the last sentence to the next page)?  <answer185999> This is still an issue with Mail.app 8.2 in OSX 10.10.4.  The only solution I have found so far is to save the email as a rich text document, then open the text document in TextEdit and save as PDF.  <comment219468> Thanks for your reply. That's a bummer.
