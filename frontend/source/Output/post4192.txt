What tools allow for creation and editing of a PDF document on OS X? <body> I would like to create a PDF document with images, text and table of contents.br I have also other PDF documents that I would like to merge in this new PDF.  Do you know some tools/software for creating PDFs?  <answer4197> fast free way:  ol liPrint each file as PDF:/li /ol  File-Print-save as PDF  ol liUse this free utility to merge PDF's to one PDF file/li /ol  http://lifehacker.com/279571/merge-multiple-pdfs-with-combine-pdfs-21  Otherwise use Adobe Pro for Mac  <answer4201> You can actually merge multiple PDFs right from Preview.app. Just open two PDFs in two separate windows, turn on the sidebars, and drag pages from one sidebar to the other. This won't provide you with a table of contents, but you can always just make something in TextEdit, export it as a PDF, then add it to the beginning of the document.  <answer4225> I use Adobe InDesign for this kind of thing... more flexible than AcrobatPro. Allows total control over what you import into the pdf (text,images, other pdfs, etc.) and the ability to create clickable TOCs. If you are going to do a lot of this, or a lot of print, it is worth the investment.  <answer20405> PDFPen and PDFPenPro from Smile Software have many capabilities and are quite affordable.   <answer37072> Microsoft Word 2011 does a solid job of creating content and saving to PDF.  File  Save As then change Format to PDF.  <comment4014> -1 Doesn't provide TOC. <comment4015> Consider re-titling. You already have PDFs, so it isn't creating it from scratch. Also, if you are OK with a (La)TeX solution, you'll get a more detailed answer on http://tex.stackexchange.com <comment4028> Clickable or just-text TOC? <comment4037> @mankoff Clickable <comment4038> Table of contents should be clickable. <comment4050> i think you'll want to use (La)TeX and re-post this question on the appropriate site. <comment24768> +2 if I could - some of my favorite software for PDF wrangling.
