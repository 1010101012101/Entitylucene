How do I type the euro value sign € on a Mac? <body> I've tried bashing on my keyboard with the kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd key pressed with the kbd⇧ shift/kbd key pressed but I do not seem to be able to find how I can get the euro value sign.  kbd⇧ shift/kbd+kbd4/kbd gives the dollar sign: strong$/strong  What keystrokes do I need to use to get the euro strong€/strong sign?  <answer105206> On an American English keyboard you can type the European Currency symbol (€) with kbdOption/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd2/kbd.  <answer105210> The Euro Currency symbol is found at kbd⌥/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbd2/kbd on the US English keyboard.  In general, if you want to discover what symbols can be found on your keyboard when you press the modifier keys, you can use the Keyboard Viewer window.  To enable the Keyboard Viewer menu item  ol liMake sure strongSystem Preferences/strong » strongKeyboard/strong » strongKeyboard/strong » strongShow Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar/strong is checked./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d92lC.png" alt="Show Keyboard and Character Viewers in menu bar"  ol start="2" liMake sure strongSystem Preferences/strong » strongLanguage &amp; Text/strong » strongInput Sources/strong » strongShow Input menu in menu bar/strong is also checked./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CY9ow.png" alt="Show Input menu in menu bar"  Once you have the keyboard viewer enabled, go to the keyboard menu in your menu bar (it will look like either a picture of a keyboard or a flag representing the keyboard layout you have selected) and chose Keyboard Viewer. A window will appear with a picture of your keyboard. If you hold down the option, shift, or option strongand/strong shift keys, it will show you what the keys on your keyboard do with those modifier keys pressed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZCHDD.png" alt="keyboard viewer"  <answer105404> Character Viewer, which will appear in the menubar along with Keyboard Viewer, may also have the symbol you want - as well as those all-important Emojis! -depending on what fonts you have installed.   <answer105460> An option to use once you know how to get the strong€/strong symbol is to create a text shortcut for the symbol on your Mac for faster typing. You can do this using text replacement.  To get started, follow these steps (also see image below for reference):  ol liLaunch strongSystem Preferences/strong and click on strongKeyboard/strong (Language &amp; Text on previous versions of OS X)./li liClick on the strongText/strong tab./li liThe strongReplace/strong and strongWith/strong columns appear. Click on the strong+/strong button at bottom-left to add a new text shortcut, which opens a text field for you to type your trigger text, for example codeeuro/code./li liPress kbd⇥ tab/kbd key or mouse over to the adjacent text field (under the strongWith/strong column) and enter the actual strong€/strong symbol. This becomes the resulting replacement text./li /ol  And you’re done. The next time you enter “euro” it will be replaced automatically with “€”.  But you can always press the Esc keyboard button (to cancel the text replacement) if you actually want to type out the word “euro”.  This also works for iOS devices under strongSettings/strong → strongGeneral/strong → strongKeyboard/strong → strongShortcuts/strong.  Please note that this does not work automatically in every app.  I’ve confirmed it works on iMessage, Notes, Reminders, Mail.    For iWork (e.g., Pages, Keynotes, Numbers) you’ll have to add the shortcuts as they use their own text replacement functionality. For example in Pages, click on the Pages menu item, then click on Auto-Correction tab, and add any text shortcuts in the same way as above. Here you can even choose to toggle (on or off) which text shortcuts you want to be active.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BujJ1.png" alt="Keyboard Text Replacement on Mac OS X"  <answer115297> just and addition here if you have you option key used to swap spaces this will override the keyboard shortcuts.

Euro sign is completed by pressing Alt key &amp; 2.   <comment123715> Option-Shift-2 ... is that on every Mac keyboard, or just on certain ones, like Canadian English?  (It also works on my US English setting.) <comment123718> Not universal; it works on US English and Canadian English. <comment123878> I think that it is important to note that this only works if the font you are using has the € symbol available. For instance, I am working on a customer's menu, and they designed it using AG Buch BQ, which has no € symbol in the font. <comment123883> There are several limitations. As you said the font must have that glyph available and it works on an American English keyboard. This may work on other keyboard layouts, but I can't attest to that. <comment123921> @gavin every app I know will substitute a font that does include Euro if the currently active font is missing it. <comment134973> Welcome to Ask Different!

Although their is some amount of font substitution possible, in a Graphic Design environment, where you are sending customer files to a printing press, messing around with the customer fonts is generally frowned upon. <comment151250> Thanks for that info, Gavin.  I didn't know that InDesign still worked this way.  Kind of defeats the purpose of using the Unicode standard, but I suppose it's useful in terms of letting users know their chosen font is not adequate for their text. <comment171998> Why do you disagree with the other answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/105206/237 <comment172002> Suspect it depends on the locale you are using, what hardware keyboard you are using etc, it's not going to be the same for everyone.  This one works for me, with a UK keyboard.  Perhaps the other answer is using a US layout. <comment172043> Tested with British & Irish, [both use alt/2]  US, Canadian & British-PC [use alt/shift/2] The alternate in each case gives ™  Very similar to the British/US 'pound' symbol, swapped between shift/3 or alt/3 depending on keyboard. <comment195106> That is not true - fn does not affect normal keys just the function keys - see this answer for UK keyboard alt-2 <comment196150> Bad idea, try to type european ... <comment206246> I thin k better to add to http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171466/237 with a comment that it is not from the site <comment247298> You forgot the additional... find this page again, scroll down to find this post... which may make it a less than optimal long-term solution ;) <comment247392> Sure, but my real point was you can just Google "Euro symbol" and copy the symbol and paste it into any app. The time it would take someone to read through and implement any of these other solutions or memorize the key command for something they seldom use, copy/paste is something that is easily remembered and implemented. <comment247394> Guess it depends where you live as to how seldom that would be. <comment254923> Good answer thanks <comment270546> Which keyboard, though? I use the U.S. Keyboard and I get this "ﬁ". <comment270574> Typing "european" works fine, as text replacement only works on complete words. But yes, if you often need to type "euro" as a word, then a different shortcut would be advisable... I like to start my replacement strings with a special character to minimise accidental replacements, e.g. "#euro". <comment271643> @IconDaemon Croatian <comment274217> I am really curious what layout you could be using on a Mac.  As far as I know, Alt ε is the standard. <comment277370> What does this add that hasn't already been said? It doesn't even include the nationality of the keyboard. <comment277394> Totally useless answer, should be deleted. <comment290512> Upvote for also mentioning the Keyboard Viewer. I keep forgetting about it. € is opt+2 on UK keyboard.
