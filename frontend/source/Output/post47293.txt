What fingers do I need to use for hitting Control, Option and Command buttons on Apple keyboard? <body> How do I place my fingers to press Control, Option and Command buttons on Apple keyboard?   What is the default and correct way to press these buttons? I'm using these keyboard shortcuts:   Command-C, Command-V, Command-Option-V, Command-Shift-V  Option-Shift-Left  Command-Spacebar  Option-Spacebar  My left hand is twisted when I try to use these shortcuts. I would like to read an article or watch a video on this topic.   <answer47294> There is no One Right Way™ of doing things. Just use what you’re comfortable with.  Anyway, here’s how I do it.  kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd, etc.: My left thumb rests on the left kbd⌘/kbd key. My left index finger hits kbdC/kbd or kbdV/kbd.  kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdV/kbd: My left thumb rests on the left kbd⌘/kbd key. My left pinky presses the left kbd⌥/kbd key. My left index finger hits kbdV/kbd.  kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdV/kbd: Same as above, except my left pinky presses the left kbdShift/kbd key instead of the left kbd⌥/kbd key.  kbd⌥/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbd←/kbd: My left thumb rests on the left kbd⌘/kbd key. I use my left pinky to hit the left kbdShift/kbd. I use my right index finger to press kbd←/kbd.  kbd⌘/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd: I use this shortcut a lot, to open apps using Spotlight. My left middle finger hits kbd⌘/kbd and my left index finger presses kbdSpace/kbd.  kbd⌥/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd: Left ring finger hits kbd⌥/kbd, left index finger hits kbdSpace/kbd.  <answer47295> There is no default way or the right way and whatever you're comfortable with at present should be fine. However, using crazy combinations can give you an injury worse than an emacs pinky, so it might be worthwhile to check what others use. Here's what I do:  ul liLeft thumb for the left kbd⌘/kbd/li liLeft middle finger for the left kbd⌥/kbd/li liLeft ring finger for kbd⌃/kbd/li liPinky for the left kbdShift/kbd/li liPinky for kbdfn/kbd/li /ul  For simple modifier + one key combinations, I use the modifier key in the appropriate half of the keyboard. While it's still thumbs for the kbd⌘/kbd keys, I find it easier to pivot about the ring finger for kbd⌥/kbd.   <answer68366> I think using kbdCmd-X/kbd for cutting/pasting is better for a number of reasons.  ol liIt's easier to keep your hand in default position on the left side and available for other functions like kbdCmd-Tab/kbd./li liThe kbdCmd-Opt-V/kbd command is more cumbersome for your hand to use for cut/paste because you have to crunch your hand over (poor ergonomics) and move your left fingers out of default position (inconvenient)./li liThe kbdCmd-Opt-V/kbd is not consistent with text editing applications. So everything else is kbdCmd-X/kbd (word, text edit, mail, ical), but then when you switch to finder it changes?!/li /ol  <comment54443> So there is no standart for this? <comment54448> Not that I know of... each one has their own habits which are kind of hard to change.
