How can I add extra groups to Finder's recognised kinds <body> presently when I attempt to group files in Finder (Yosemite 10.10.3) by strongkind/strong the created emDocuments/em category creates a vast number of files including CSVs DOCX etc: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jr8Rz.png" alt="enter image description here" Is it possible to make this groupings more efficient, by:  ol liGrouping files by extension strong-or-/strong/li liDefining what extensions are classified where, for instance in case of the emDocuments/em category I would like for it to contain only PDFs and DOC/X-XLS/X files whereas CSVs could be in a separate emdata/em category. The emdeveloper/em category is particularly messy as it tends to contain hundreds of files, lot of them created automatically when working with *.tex files./li /ol  <answer181170> I would recommend creating several saved searches, each for a specific file extension within a given folder, and then add each saved search to the strongFinder/strong sidebar. For example:  ol liIn strongFinder/strong, go to your working folder, then type something (e.g., xxx) in the strongSearch/strong field./li liThis reveals the strongSearch/strong row; click the 'strong+/strong' at the far right./li liChange strongKind/strong to strongFile extension/strong, and type one of the extensions you need./li liRemove the "xxx" or whatever you had originally typed./li liClick the strongSave/strong button./li liType a meaningful name for your search (e.g., strongDocuments - PDF/strong), and tick the strongAdd To Sidebar/strong checkbox./li /ol  Now that you have a saved search in the Finder sidebar, you can make duplicates of it.  ol start="7" liIn the strongFinder/strong, right-click the strongDocuments - PDF/strong (that you just created), and choose strongShow in Enclosing Folder/strong./li liDuplicate your saved search, and rename it to something like strongDocuments - DOC/strong (i.e., for whatever you intend it to represent)./li liSelect the duplicate search, and choose strongFile/strong menu  strongAdd To Sidebar/strong./li liIn the strongFinder/strong sidebar, click the strongDocuments - DOC/strong shortcut you just created./li liThen right-click the shortcut and choose strongShow Search Criteria/strong./li liAt this point, change strongPDF/strong to strongDOC/strong. Optionally, you could click 'strong+/strong' and add strongDOCX/strong here, as well./li /ol  Unfortunately, you can't modify the folder location that a saved search points to; this seems like an oversight, but there you go.  <comment215420> What I'm interested in, I as a method to modify the categories that are applied when the Finder sorts files by *kind*. Some of them (developer and documents in particular) are too big to be useful. I want to be able to apply this sorting to any folder I'm, I don't want to have **X** saved searches available, I'll be always creating new ones for different folders. <comment215505> I would imagine that you would need to build Spotlight plugins for the file types in order for them to show up with their own categories. <comment215607> @StuartH, thanks. To be honest this is not most fortunate solution. As a matter of fact I came across [similar discussion](http://superuser.com/questions/371892/osx-assign-extension-to-content-kind), I don't believe how tedious is that. Windows 7 ability to group files by extension seems to be much more efficient. <comment215615> agreed, it's a pretty time consuming ordeal. Have you looked at the possibility of an AppleScript that you could trigger to create a smart search using the current folder for scope? For example, when triggered, you could define the extension you want the script to isolate within your current folder and have it create a temporary smart search for you to use. <comment215627> @StuartH I didn't consider this possibility. In my naivety, I was hoping that it would be simply a matter of typing some commands in the terminal in order to associate, let it be `*.tex` extension with `LaTeX` or `Publishing` category. Right now all the `tex` files are crammed with other stuff in the `Developer` category which renders it practically useless.
