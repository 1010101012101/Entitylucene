How do I stop my computer name from automatically, and incorrectly, changing? <body> Ever since I upgraded my 2009 iMac to Mavericks, I often get a message stating 'The name of your computer "Foo" is already in use on this network. The name has been changed to "Foo (2)".'. The number at the end will continuously increment over time as the same error keeps happening.  It is trivial enough to rename the computer back, but is there a way to prevent this from happening in future? I had an old Macbook Pro (running Mountain Lion) that had the same issue, but my early 2013 MBP running Mavericks doesn't seem to be suffering from this issue.  <answer125528> Are you using two network devices that are on the same LAN? For example, wifi and wired ethernet? Try disabling one of them. I used to have that problem and fixed it this way.  <answer145021> This is probably to do with the user who is active when you join the network and set up the machine for the first time. It is probable that when you are building these machines you are always doing so as the same user  If you create a user eg dave on, for example a MacBook Pro,the machine will auto-config the naming as follows:  Computer Name: dave's MacBook Pro  local hostname: daves-MacBook-Pro.local  and in Terminal, the hostname will show as: daves-mbp  Assuming the next machine you log into as 'dave' is also a MacBook Pro, it will set exactly the same details -  you connect to the network and you get the message about the duplicate name.  Where I work we change the name in Sharing then open a terminal and run the following command: sudo scutil â€“-set HostName new_hostname  (where new_hostname is your chosen name)  Then exit and restart terminal and you will see the new hostname.  You will also get this issue when migrating users to new machines - the migration assistant/time Machine will rename the new machine  some typically weak info on names - http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13790  <answer146148> Same problem here.  But is seems that the foo (2) name is accepted by time machine and it still does the backup to the same place (it doesn't seem to redo the whole backup, it continues).  So no harm no foul.  I think that it is related to multiple active interfaces, I popped up the ethernet to speed up my backup.  <answer153355> This occurs when running two overlapping DHCP servers. If you are using more than one router (bridge-mode) then make sure only one of them is running DHCP without a static IP.  <answer220204> There is no good way to stop this. Apple would have to replace the code for the host name so that users (people and programs) are always presented with the host name that is set by codescutil/code and do all the renaming/translation under the hood.  Since this has been going on across all Apple product lines (Apple TV, iPhone, Mac and presumably even the Apple Watch) since 2012 at least, it's not clear that Apple sees this as a problem to be fixed.  <comment146767> Is the name it says actually an empty string? If it is, what does it say if you change your computer name? <comment146777> No it is the name of my computer (crap, I see that the text I typed was removed. No doubt due to the angle brackets). For example, if my computer name is 'Foo', my computer will be named 'Foo (2)'. <comment146779> I've edited the question to clarify that an empty string is not shown. <comment146789> [This might be the same problem you're having.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55416/my-mac-minis-computer-name-keeps-changing-when-it-resumes-from-sleep?rq=1) Also try running `scutil --get ComputerName` and `hostname` in Terminal. (You should probably also keep track of your IP address to see if it changes) I do think it's something with your router or DHCP, and NetBIOS names might be cached too long. <comment146802> Thanks for the suggestions, I'll look into them. If my router is at fault (Apple Airport Extreme), why is it not also happening to my Macbook Pro? <comment146804> I think it might just be the combination of an older iMac running Mavericks and some kind of problem with the router. I have had a couple problems with NetBIOS on my AirPort Extreme and other OS X versions (and Linux), so that seems reasonable. <comment146805> Yeah, could be. I'm trying the scutil --set trick. Fingers crossed that it works. Fingers crossed that also helps with iTunes wifi sync being so unreliable, but I'll solve one problem at a time. Thanks for your help. :-) <comment146900> scutil --set didn't work. I've had the same issue happen today. scutil --get ComputerName shows the name has changed to 'foo (2)', whereas scutil --get LocalHostName and scutil --get HostName both show 'foo'. I'll try going with a static IP address rather than a DHCP assigned one. <comment146901> With Airport Utility you can set a certain MAC address (it might say Wi-Fi address) to have a DHCP reservation, which would be easier (and less error-prone) than setting it on your iMac. <comment146925> I wasn't, but I am now. Devices generally either connect via wifi or wired ethernet. But today I've changed my iMac to connect via wifi and ethernet, in an attempt to get iTunes wifi sync working. This change was made after the latest iMac renaming incident, so wouldn't be the cause in this instance. <comment146926> Yeah, I know. I've done that today, and will see if that makes a difference. <comment170846> This happens with two machines set up over a year ago or in the OPs case one machine <comment172226> You are correct that having two network interfaces seems to make this more likely to happen. It's clear it also happens when there is one interface and a machine sleeps for a time close to the DHCP reservation time on the router. <comment180499> That is not the case here. The only DHCP server I have is my Airport Extreme router. <comment236066> Still no answer? This is still happening with OS X 10.10.4 on a late 2011 MacBook Pro 17". It may have something to do with being connected to wi-fi and ethernet at the same time, but what a pain that OS X doesn't figure this out on it's own.
