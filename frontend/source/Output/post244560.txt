Apple TV With Macbook Air Peer to Peer Connection <body> I need to present Power-Points with a projector and my Macbook Air 1.4. If I got an Apple TV would I be able to present my slides using the strongpeer to peer mode/strong on the Apple TV?   I will not be able to access any router or Wifi hot-spots so I need to make sure this will work without external internet connection. I have read some tutorials saying it would not work and others saying it would with a certain version of the Apple TV. Which version would I need to get of the Apple TV? Will my current Macbook(running 10.9.5) work?  Thank you for your time!  <comment301398> From this site, http://www.imore.com/how-airplay-mirror-your-mac-screen-your-apple-tv I would think I need a 3rd gen TV rev A and a macbook made in 2012 or later....would this be the right model: http://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-tv-black/4854433.p?id=1218552476525&skuId=4854433
