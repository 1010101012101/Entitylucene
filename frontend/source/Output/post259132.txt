I can't boot Windows 7 USB from macOS Sierra using option key <body> I want to install Windows 7 on my Mac, which is running macOS Sierra.  I can't do this with Boot Camp, since Boot Camp only supports Windows 8 and later.  I need to boot from the USB, which I created, but I can't do it using the usual method of holding down kbdoption/kbd key while booting the Mac.  I also tried holding down kbdshift/kbd key, nothing works, it just starts as usual.  How can I actually boot from USB and are there different keys to press in order to boot from USB or boot in safe mode in macOS Sierra?  <answer264312>    Mac computers using macOS Sierra 10.12 support new installations of   Windows 10 only. macOS Sierra does not support new installations of   earlier versions of Windows.   See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205016 for more information.   <comment324095> To clarify, you're only holding the `Option (Alt)` key on startup, right? Not `Option + Tab`? <comment324098> I tried both combinations <comment324099> It seems I have confused ALT / Options and TAB, while only holding ALT it works. It doesn't recognize the USB but I get to the booting menu. I think this question should be closed :/ <comment324107> No worries- glad to hear the boot picker comes up as expected.
