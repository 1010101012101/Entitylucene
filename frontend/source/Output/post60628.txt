Insert images into Pages document using AppleScript <body> I'm trying to automate the construction of a document, and am looking for a way to insert images into a Pages document with AppleScript. For example:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "Pages"     make new document     tell document 1       tell body text             make new paragraph at end with data Â¬          "another paragraph" with properties {paragraph style:"Body"}          make new image at end with properties ??? :(        end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Nothing I've tried so far works - "make new graphic", "make new image", "insert image data" and so on. I'm not ruling out the possibility that it's not possible at all (I've used AppleScript for long enough, so that wouldn't be a surprise) but it would be good if it could be persuaded to work.   emSolution/em  @jackjr300 's solution works great. I finally went with this incantation:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset fname to "/Users/me/Desktop/picture.png" set thisImage to POSIX path of fname tell application "Pages"     tell document 1         tell body text             make new paragraph at end with data "another paragraph" with properties {paragraph style:"Body"}             make new image at after last paragraph with properties {image data:thisImage}         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer60633> Here's an example that works.   precodeset thisImage to choose file with prompt "Select an image" tell application "Pages"   tell (make new document)       tell body text           make new paragraph at end with data "another paragraph" with properties {paragraph style:"Body"}           make new image at after last paragraph with properties {image data:thisImage}       end tell   end tell end tell /code/pre   <comment69818> Thanks - that looks extremely promising!
