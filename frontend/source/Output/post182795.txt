iCloud syncing seems to have stopped, can't delete folders <body> I am using iCloud Drive on my Macbook Pro, and I noticed that even if the iCloud folder has my files, they're not really synced on the cloud. Many files still have the cloud icon next to them:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AYvze.png" alt="enter image description here"  Probably it means that they are still getting uploaded, but the worst fact is that there's no feedback about it. I think iCloud just stopped syncing the files, because I see no progress. The iCloud free space stays always the same.    And there are even some extra folders that I don't see on my iCloud folder, which are visible on icloud.com and I can't delete them because I keep getting an error:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eyhwu.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'd like to know if there's a way to get a feedback (which folders are getting sync'd for example, and the speed), and to know if the folder are effectively being sync'd or if the whole process is stuck.   <answer182800> The "Try again later" is a typical indication that the Apple servers are to busy. Waiting 24-48 hours is the only solution here.  You can try to log out/in but it is questionable that would help. Just in case, check if your Calendar is been updated.  <answer186783> The problem is that you can't delete a large number of files at the same time. Try going into the folders and deleting 1-5 files at a time. Appears to be a well-known issue.  <comment217734> So you are on Yosemite with Mac ? and you tried to log out/In ! <comment217754> I tried, but it just doesn't work, no file gets sync'd. <comment217763> Are you using app called "Little Snitch" ? Check the iCloud account in use by clicking Account Details. Data can only sync across a single iCloud account..... Ensure that iCloud Drive is enabled. <comment220207> Yes but I'm trying it from more than two weeks. I just switched to one drive. <comment310493> Strangely enough, I seem to have had this same problem on iCloud Drive in OS X. Couldn't delete folders, but I could manually remove the files in the folder. I then removed the Drive folder using `rmdir dir` in Terminal (or `rm -f dir` for folders and their files).
