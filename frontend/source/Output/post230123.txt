Is it possible to replace battery in an old iPad? <body> I have an old iPad 2.  The battery goes dead when it is unused for only one day. Should I change the battery and if yes, how should I do it?  <answer230130> Yes it's possible, but it's incredible hard for almost any average or advanced user, so I highly recommend against it, sorry.  Here is a nice step by step guide from the folks of iFixit, if you are (really) adventurous enough...  Best luck!  <comment280906> Actually I had this done recently at a local phone repair shop. Many of them will be able to replace batteries, glass and screens for a reasonable cost. Doing it yourself with no previous experience, unless you do a lot of electronics repair, could easily result in a pile of useless junk.
