Is a SuperDuper sparsebundle secure? <body> I am backing up my computer to a sparse bundle on a USB drive attached to my airport extreme. If someone were to steal this drive, would they have access to the full contents of the image, or is it protected by my system password?  I can't encrypt the drive itself since Finder won't mount it over the network if I do. With time machine, there is a specific option to encrypt the backup when I select the disk to use. Is there some similar setting in SuperDuper?  My basic goal is to have a bootable backup that is  a) on a network disk b) doesn't yield all of my information if physically stolen.  The computer being backed up uses file vault 2 encryption, in case it's relevant.  <comment180832> How does this differ from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47099/how-to-make-secure-backups-using-superduper?rq=1 ? <comment180849> The disk being remote makes all the difference unfortunately.
