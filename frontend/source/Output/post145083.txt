USB Flash Drive not showing up <body> I was using a usb flash drive to make a bootable bootcamp Windows 7 install disk. However, I tried to format it and could not, so I decided it was a good idea to manually delete the files inside. Now whenever I plug my flash drive in the computer it doesn't show up. The usb doesn't show up in disk utility, or on my windows computer. Is there anyway I can resolve this problem? I don't mind loosing any data on the drive. I am using Mac OS X Mavericks.   <comment170956> It was formatted with boot sector. Now you have to completely erase it and reformat using disk Utility. <comment170958> Why did the Disk Utility did not work? <comment170967> In Disk Utility, the option to Erase was greyed out. How can I completely erase it now that it doesn't show up in Disk Util? <comment170974> Do you know how to use Terminal ? <comment171132> I'm familiar with it, yes
