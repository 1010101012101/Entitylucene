Boot camp install of Windows 7 issue, no bootable devices <body> So I have a 2010 15" macbook pro (MBP6,1) and I replaced the optical drive with a hard disk. I wanted to install windows 7 on the hard disk with boot camp with a USB and ISO image.  After searching I found that I need to modify my plist.info to allow my boot camp to create a bootable USB (since normally it doesn't have the option to create the USB for my model since it came with a disk drive).   After doing so and seemingly having a fine (but long) install process onto the USB. I told boot camp how much space to partition windows on and hit install.  Then the computer restarted. When it came back up it was stuck on a grey apple logo screen forever (I waited 15 minutes to ensure it wasn't just "thinking"). I force restarted and the next time it turned on it got stuck on the grey logo for a bit but then proceeded to go to a black screen that said " No bootable device - please insert a bootable device and hit any key". I tried hitting keys with he USB in but nothing happened.  I had to eventually remove the USB and reset PRAM to get it to boot into osx again  Is there any way to install windows 7 from a usb on my macbook pro using boot camp?  <answer179489> Here's one way of doing it, it's not elegant but it will work.  Download and install Virtualbox and install Windows on it from your .ISO file. This will verify your .ISO is working. Once you've got Windows installed, download Rufus. This will create a bootable USB drive that emwill/em boot your MacBook, assuming the .ISO is good to begin with. Once that's done you can bin the virtual machine and Virtualbox, ready to install Windows for real on the Boot Camp partition (if that's where it's going).  It's worth noting you don't need to use Boot Camp if Windows is going onto a drive of its own - BC is designed to create a hybrid partition table that will allow OS X and Windows to co-exist, and simply isn't needed if the OSes live on separate drives.  <answer180263> h1UPDATE/h1  An improved procedure for installing Windows 7 can be found at strongInstalling Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive/strong  h2Note:/h2  The updated steps, for installing Windows 8.1 using the procedure given below, can be found here.  hr  My hardware and software differs from yours.

I know my iso works because I used it on parallels and then decided I would rather have a real install instead of a virtual machine. So from here I should use Rufus to make a bootable USB? And then what? Use boot camp with the Rufus USB? How do I get the windows compatibility tools that apple provides to get the touch pad and other things working? <comment212779> If you've an existing VM then yes, download Rufus and use that to create your bootable USB device. Whatever method you used to create your original USB installer obviously didn't work, I've Rufus many times and it's very effective at creating bootable USB devices. Once you've done that you will be able to startup from the USB stick using the boot selector and install Win 7 as if it was on a DVD. <comment212785> As for compatibility, simply download the Boot Camp driver pack for your MacBook, copy to a USB device and install under Windows. <comment212795> also when windows is installed on the separate disk how do i choose which my computer will boot into? <comment212826> OS X offers **Startup Disk** to set the preferred default OS, Windows will offer the same option once the Boot Camp drivers have been installed. You also have the startup boot selector, hold **Option** when you hear the Mac startup chime. Whether you use the System Preference pane or the startup boot selector, OS X will list all available bootable disks. <comment214066> @ScunnerDarkly: Are you positive that windows can be installed on a 2010 MBP using a USB flash drive? I have a 2007 iMac and I tried virtually every combination of Rufus options. I tried modifying the Boot Camp Assistance to create the flash drive installer. This flash drive did not work. I tried the Windows 7 flash drive installer from Microsoft with no luck. I installed rEFInd and it would sometime detect the flash drive under certain formats, but never successfully started to install. <comment214118> thanks for the awesome help! I will try this all out this weekend and report back with (hopeful) success. <comment215757> @David Anderson: I've not tried on a 2010 model, boot support does seem to vary quite a bit between MacBook generations. I've a 2011 MBP 15" that doesn't want to know about Rufus-created USB versions of Windows, Mint/Ubuntu Linux or one of my favourite tools, Parted Magic - yet my 2012 MBP 13" boots *all* of these absolutely fine from USB. Incidentally, the Boot Camp utility that ships with 10.9 gives the option to create a USB Windows installer regardless of whether the host Mac has an optical drive or not, so this may be worth a try if you've tried everything else... <comment236281> David, thanks a million! I could not for the life of me figure out how to get around the blank screen. This solution worked out very well and was only slightly more complicated than a standard Bootcamp install. This helped me fix the issue that I was hitting in this Apple Support Forum thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6448031?start=30&tstart=0 <comment238471> Man, I don't know, how are you doing this. You didn't guess this things, you know them all. Greatly appreciate your help, it's just WOW! <comment240266> Great guide. A few notes: The Bootcamp drivers don't need to be on a *flash* drive. Any regular external USB drive works. To write the hex data to the drive, you could also use my tool "iBored" (http://apps.tempel.org/iBored/). <comment251753> Amazing work. Would it be possible to skip the hybrid MBR/EFI step and do an EFI-only install on a later model Mac and/or later version of Windows? That should allow more than 4 partitions, correct? <comment253012> @Evan: If you have Mac that supports an EFI install of Windows, then that model would also support using a flash drive to install Windows. In such a case, there would be little point to using the above answer. You would be better off following Apple's published Windows installation procedures. <comment253124> @DavidAnderson Gotcha. I was looking more for a way to run a natively installed OS as a VirtualBox Guest. I tried it out this weekend without success and ended up natively installing Windows instead. After reading your comment I experimented a bit and managed to get EFI to boot to ReFind (ie my custom bootloader) but it bluescreens when I launch Windows. Getting it to work with EFI required adding the boot partition /dev/disk0s1 to the vmdk with rw permissions. I'm going to try Linux next. <comment253128> One other minor addition. If the VM crashes with an error when you try to load it, try setting 'Use Host IO Cache' in the storage settings. <comment253255> @Evan: Why not post a question explaining what you are trying to do? I believe VirtualBox emulates hardware which is different from the physical hardware of the host machine. Therefore, I don't think you can run a natively installed Windows as a VirtualBox guest. I am confused by your last post. ReFind is a boot manager not a boot loader. It would also help if you could give the model of your Mac and the version of Windows and Linux. <comment266449> Wonderful tutorial! I got a "VERR_NOT_SUPPORTED" error when trying to boot with VirtualBox 5. I needed to enable "Use Host I/O Cache" in the Sata options and it worked. <comment279147> Excellent tutorial and worked perfectly when even buying an external optical drive failed me (internal one failed). My only suggestion would be to add comments when going through terminal to expect some false positive errors. (I got really confused during these). <comment279149> @ghostof101: Feel free to edit my answer and add some comments. The changes will be reviewed (and possibly edited) before being made viewable by others. <comment279152> @ghostof101: Actually, these instructions have been replaced by a sightly improved procedure. See: [Installing Windows 7 Pro 64 bit without DVD or Flash Drive](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/225387/no-bootable-device-usb-2-0-macbook-pro-mid-2014/225521#225521). Basically, the new procedure does not require installing Windows 7 twice. Instead, VirtualBox is only used to copy the installation software to the Boot Camp partition. The installation of Windows then takes place without using a virtual environment. <comment279160> @davidanderson Ah! Thank you kindly. I had a member of my team that was having the exact same version. Nice to know he won't have to do quite as many hoops as I did. ;) <comment309977> I get a problem with Step 8: http://imgur.com/a/0pAfx When creating an New Blank Image I get Disk Utility error -61 <comment309995> @Sean: Are you sure you selected the correct folder and that the volume had enough free space? See [this link](http://imgur.com/5k8PdLZ) for an expanded view of the image shown in Step 8. This new image was taken using OS X 10.11.6. Are you using a different version of OS X? <comment310013> @David Anderson yes that was the problem I wasn't creating a VirtualBox folder and was selecting the drive instead. I followed the instructions but still got the dreaded "No bootable devices" error. Installing http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/sip.html as a Boot Manager helped to force find the Windows installation and boot from it. <comment310026> @Sean: By installing and using rEFInd, one can replace many of the steps in the procedure. If you had to use rEFInd to finish the installation, then you probably just made an error applying one or more of the posted steps. For example, using rEFInd can eliminate the need to create and use the BCSSOFTWARE partition. <comment329534> Sadly can't get my external SSD to show as a boot option when restarting with options.
