Keyboard Shortcuts for "Compress" or "New Folder with Selection"? <body> Has anybody found a decent solution to this? Custom keyboard shortcuts (as defined in System Preferences  Keyboard) don't work for any dynamic menus like strongCompress XX items/strong emor/em (new in Lion) strongNew Folder with Selection (XX items)/strong because they add the number of files selected after them.   Are there emundocumented/em wildcards for keyboard shortcuts?  Unlike strongCompress/strong, strongNew Folder with Selection (XX items)/strong does have a default keyboard shortcut, but there still doesn't seem to be a way to change it.   <answer20577> There aren't any wildcard characters that I am aware of. This is the first I'm running into this problem.  One could work around this by using GUI scripting, which refers to menu items by their position in the menu instead of their name. You could then use another program to enable system-wide use of whatever hotkey you wanted for this script.  <answer26855> The shortcut for a new folder with selection is Control + Command + N.  There isn't a shortcut for Compress, but you can script it and then assign a shortcut to the script:  Use AppleScript Editor and refer to this script from Super User on adding a shortcut:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"     tell menu 1 of menu bar item 3 of menu bar 1         click (menu item 1 where name starts with "Compress")     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer35481> I found it, for Lion:br - Run Automatorbr - create a "Service" which compresses a "file or folder" for the application "Finder"br - Save the Service with a name like "Compress"br - Go to Preferences - keyboard - Shortcuts - Services, and add the Shortcut you want for "Compress" under "Finder". br br That's it.  <answer171478> For compressing i found simple solution. I'm using strongOS X Yosemite 10.10.2/strong and It's worked for me.  Open system preferences and follow the screenshots:  -- Step1: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCsj0.png" alt="enter image description here"  -- Step2: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7Pfk.png" alt="enter image description here"  -- Step3: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RXhX0.png" alt="enter image description here"  -- Step4(It's Done): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZypSt.png" alt="enter image description here"  That's It.  I know it's been long time since you asked the Question but i'm posting the answers for those who are still looking for solution.  <comment22662> I know. I'd like to change it to cmd+g (using keyboard shortcuts) and change "compress" to cmd+opt+z but I can't change either because the menu items dynamically display the number of files selected. <comment73019> Not sure I understand the question. "New folder with selection (xx items)" is cmd+ctrl+n.
