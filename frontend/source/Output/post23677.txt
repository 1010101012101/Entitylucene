The Function (fn) key keeps bringing up Mission Control. How do I disable it? <body> (fn) Function Key keeps bringing up Mission Control. How do I disable it? I have looked all around and have found no answers? any ideas?  <answer23683> To disable the functions of all Fn keys you can go to Apple  System Preferences. Then click on strongKeyboard/strong and check the box that says em"Use all F1, F2, keys as standard function keys"/em  As for jsut Mission Control you can go to in System Preferences to strongMission Control/strong, and you'll find there some list menus that let you choose the keys for the different features of Mission Control. At the bottom there is a "-" which turns it off.  <answer24355> I was able to replicate the problem. Here's what worked on my machine to fix it:  ul liGo to System Preferences Â» Mission Control/li liUnder codeKeyboard and Mouse Shortcuts/code, go to codeMission Control/code. ul liIf it's set to codefn/code, set it to some other value (or the code-/code at the bottom of the list to disable a keyboard shortcut for Mission Control)./li liIf it's not set for codefn/code, but codefn/code keeps triggering it (which happened to me), change it to anything else, then change it back to the value you want it to have./li /ul/li /ul  On my machine, that made codefn/code stop triggering Mission Control.  <comment26468> The fn key at the lower left of the keyboard by itself is invoking Mission Control? <comment26525> @Daniel Yes it does. If you see my post below I gave some more info about the settings. Not sure where I can deactivate this. It is ironic that I can't find an easy fix to this. Most likely the setting is in some random place just need to locate it. <comment36300> That does not disable "all Fn functions" by far. I use Fn in tandem with nearly every key on my keyboard. That preference only changes the behavior of the Function (F1-F12) key row, and otherwise does nothing to the Fn button.
