Is there a cable I can buy to view items from apple products on the Samsung monitor?? thanks  <answer169760> Here's the video cable you need.  Here's the audio cable you need.  Based on the presumed age of the laptop, it's a Mini DisplayPort connection, not Thunderbolt.  The former cannot carry audio, hence the second cable.  <comment199441> Could you give more details about the macbook (a different cable could be needed depending which model it is), and confirm what the "old PC" connection is ([these visuals](http://www.svideo.com/pctvcables.html) should help, if needed). I'd assume that its VGA, but it's better to be sure. <comment199447> Many thanks D.G. - i have just added images of the macbook and tv <comment199449> What model is the macbook? That looks like a *Mini DisplayPort* but I'd prefer to be sure, and I think some, but not all, models were able to send audio along with the video which could change the cable choices. You should be able to click the Apple logo in the menu, and select "About This Mac" to get more information on the model. <comment199453> It's a safe bet, though some Mini DisplayPort connections do carry audio, apparently. e.g. This [macbook pro](http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.53-aluminum-17-mid-2010-unibody-specs.html). <comment199459> thankyou - I will check and send you an image asap
