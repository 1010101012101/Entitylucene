How can I make a .command file that I can share without giving permissions on each computer? <body> I have a terminal command that I would like to run.  precode    telnet 169.254.216.127 54326 /code/pre  Ideally I would like to convert this into a code.command/code file and be able to share it with many other mac users emwithout/em them having to give permissions using sudo...   Is this possible? Can I create an extremely simple app that keeps the terminal window open after it has run?  Any help would be much appreciated.  <answer102890> The execute permission does also transfer to other computers. If the permissions of the file are lost when you transfer the file, you might create a zip or tar archive for the .command file:  precode$ echo telnet 169.254.216.127 54326 &gt; test.command $ chmod +x test.command $ tar -cf test.tar test.command $  /code/pre  You might also save a script like this as an application in AppleScript Editor:  precodetell application "Terminal"     do script "telnet 169.254.216.127 54326"     activate end tell /code/pre
