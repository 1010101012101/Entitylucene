XQuartz, utf-8 and filenames <body> This is a question in the continuation of this one: UTF8 filenames and shell utilities: the nightmare of utf-8 and filenames is….  How to avoid this confusion with most notably the codels/code command on filnames created in the following way:  precode$ echo $LANG en_US.UTF-8 $ mkdir test $ cd test $ touch á $ touch a´ $ /code/pre  The first file is created by typing kbdalt ⌥/kbd+kbdE/kbd, kbdA/kbd, the second one by typing kbdA/kbd, kbdalt ⌥/kbd+kbdshift ⇧/kbd+kbdE/kbd  Within an codexterm/code window I get:  precode$ ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x  2 hal  admin   136 Nov 11 15:52 . drwxr-x---  7 hal  admin  4386 Nov 11 14:25 .. -rw-r--r--  1 hal  admin     0 Nov 11 15:52 a´ -rw-r--r--  1 hal  admin     0 Nov 11 15:48 a´ $ /code/pre  Which is wrong.  Within a codeTerminal/code window I get:  precode$ ls -al total 0 drwxr-xr-x  2 hal  admin   136 Nov 11 15:52 . drwxr-x---  7 hal  admin  4386 Nov 11 14:25 .. -rw-r--r--  1 hal  admin     0 Nov 11 15:52 a´ -rw-r--r--  1 hal  admin     0 Nov 11 15:48 á $ /code/pre  Which is right.  The result is the same whichever shell I use: codebash/code or codezsh/code.  hr What codexterm/code or codeXQuartz/code setting will avoid these 2 filenames to falsely look the same? hr This problem doesn't exist on Mavericks (MacOS X 10.9).  <answer126987> I am having a similar issues (related to R documentation), which boil down to the same thing.  From an XQuartz window, if you right click (or CTRL r-click) to get to the VT fonts menu, then select UTF8-fonts and UTF8-encoding, this will probably fix your problem.  However, I have not yet found a way to configure these by default, although I have found this:  precode$ appres XTerm | grep UTF *fontMenu*utf8-mode*Label:      UTF-8 Encoding *fontMenu*utf8-fonts*Label:     UTF-8 Fonts *fontMenu*utf8-title*Label:     UTF-8 Titles /code/pre  I took a wild stab in the dark and added this to my .Xdefaults:  precodexterm*utf8-mode: 1 xterm*utf8-fonts: 1 /code/pre  Unsuprisingly this did not work, since these 2 resources don't exist. I'm still looking for a way to turn it on by default.  <answer126991> Okay, finally sorted with the help of this post:  ul lihttp://lists.apple.com/archives/x11-users/2008/Mar/msg00202.html/li /ul  In summary, go here:  ul lihttp://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCEnvironment//li /ul  Download the preference pane, and add this entry:  precodeKey=LANG Value=en_GB.UTF-8 /code/pre  I had already added this to my .bashrc and my .profile with no result. But I think XQuartz doesn't launch within that environment, so it never sees it until it is too late.  <comment148738> Okay, finally sorted with the help of this post: <comment149101> First part of your proposal is not relevant. As you may have noticed from the output of the `echo $LANG`, I'm in a fully utf-8 mode up to the shell level. <comment149124> Since you don't really bring any sort of solution to the original problem, I'd suggest you to put this within comments: "Here is what I tested and failed" and not within an answer.
