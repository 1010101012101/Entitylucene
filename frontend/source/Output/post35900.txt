In Final Cut Pro can I tile a background image? <body> I am currently trying to see if I have to make a Tiling background image outside Final Cut or not (I currently am on an Ubuntu Machine which doesn't have access to OSX).  If you can, please could someone post instructions to do so. My college use Final Cut Express 7 (but I can access the Pro version if needed on some machines).  <comment40956> We don't get many Final Cut questions here. I suggest you try http://www.creativecow.net/ <comment45972> I would also suggest flagging it for migration to [AVP.SE](http://avp.stackexchange.com)
