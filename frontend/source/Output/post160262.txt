How is it possible to remotely access photos on iPhone? <body> Is there any software to do so, and what would it take to install it?br Another person had physical access to my phone, so I suspect the possibility of installation of such software.br Even photos which I immediately deleted and those, which went straight to application got in other hands.  I have an iPhone 4s. It was not jailbroken (at least, by me), and it did not appear such: no Cydia app or other oddities.br Photo Stream and iCloud backup for photos were also off, and I never used them.  <answer160265> Dropbox, Google+ and other similar apps offer the ability to automatically upload new photos to your cloud storage. Do you have anything like that installed?  <comment188415> 'got out'? You mean they were published somewhere online? If they had your phone & full access to it, they could have used your own email or any type of 'share' to send them to anywhere, without installing anything. <comment189530> No, nothing like that. <comment189538> @Tetsujiin Clarified that. <comment189541> There are many ways it could be done without any additional software. One thing you should do immediately is change your AppleID password. <comment189585> @Tetsujin Yes, that's what I did. Can you please explain more? <comment189588> open Photo, pick any picture, tap the Share button bottom left - that's how many options there already are to send the pic from your device without the need to install further software
