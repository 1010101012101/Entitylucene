Thanks. <comment8337> Nice, but not too easy to set up. <comment8344> The easy setup isn't free. The free setup isn't easy. Pick your poison :) <comment95851> works for me too. After trying some hours to connect with esd to pulseaudio (without success) this worked. Thanks! <comment329888> Shairport works great. For me the installation from the repository worked out of the box: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dantheperson/shairplay-sync` `sudo apt-get update` `sudo apt-get install shairplay-sync`. After this I found my server pressing alt+volume icon on my mac. <comment330266> Oh, I didn't know there was a PPA for this. I'll update my answer with your information. Thanks!
