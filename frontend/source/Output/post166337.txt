Facebook Messenger App - Login Report <body> I have a question regarding the Facebook Messenger App regarding the multiple login on different devices and some kind of report of that.  So here's what happened (I'll make it short): I have an iPhone and an Android tablet, but I lent the tablet to one of my friends for 2 weeks. Now I am pretty sure that he read all my incoming messages because on my iPhone they were already shown as "Read by me" when I opened the Messenger app and these are the only two devices where I check my messages.  I asked him, but of course he said that he didn't read them.  Now I would like to know if there is any chance that I can see when I used the app to read messages and especially where (so that I can exclude hacking), so basically some kind of report for every read message or at least a usage report with data about my account.  Thanks for your help in advance!  <answer231849> From Facebook Settings (on a PC), click the 'download a copy of your Facebook data' link.

When messages are sent within a relatively short time period, only the first one shows the stamp.  Otherwise, I think that's the best you'll be able to do. <comment194969> did you try to change your password to exclude hacking?
