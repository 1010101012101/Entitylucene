Connectivity from iMac to TV via HDMI cable <body> I connected my iMac to my TV via HDMI cable. The desktop background shows up on the TV, but no other content. Oddly, a couple of the items in system preferences show up, but nothing else. How can I see what's on my computer on my TV screen?  <answer222042> On your iMac, click System Preferences  Displays  Arrangement, and check the box that says "Mirror Displays".   This will essentially mirror your computer's screen to your TV connected through HDMI.
