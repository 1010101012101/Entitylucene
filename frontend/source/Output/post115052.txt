Install Xcode in OS X Tiger 10.4.11 <body> So I'm attempting to install Xcode on OS X Tiger on my iBook G4 (It was a gift.) I needed Xcode because I was trying to install MacPorts so that I could easily install software, namely codegit/code.   However, when I attempt to install it via what MacPorts says to do: http://guide.macports.org/#installing.xcode.other via the link for 10.4, it just sits there loading… nothing happens.  Does anyone know of a better way to install MacPorts than via Xcode, because I can't download it. …or if anyone knows how to install Xcode for OSX 10.4.11, that would be great!  <answer115055> I had more success with downloading it from developer.apple.com directly  ul liPoint Safari to http://developer.apple.com//li liClick on Mac Dev Center (on the left, in the OS X Mavericks box/li liSign in (or create a free account if you don't have one yet)/li liIn the "Additional Downloads" section at the bottom, click on "View all downloads"/li liDeselect all categories besides "Developer Tools"/li liJump to about page 10 (of 11), the package is from Nov 2, 2007/li liClick on "Xcode 2.5 Developer Tools"/li /ul  <comment134710> Will try this out and see if I can't get it working! <comment134728> strikethroughPoke around in Apple's developer centre, I succeeded to install XCode for Tiger there. That's a while ago, though, so I don't remember exactly how I found it./strikethrough I just read patrix' answer.
