Root crontab won't save <body> I'm trying to add a crontab entry to my root user's crontab. I'm able to add an entry without issue to my regular user's crontab, but when I codesu/code to root user and try adding a crontab entry it does not save the entry.   The process I'm going through is:  precode$sudo su $crontab -e # write out my crontab entry and then :wq to write and quit vi $crontab -l crontab: no crontab for root /code/pre  I've also tried exiting vi using codewq!/code and it still will not save the entry.   The entry that I'm entering is:  precode* * * * * /sayhi.sh /code/pre  codesayhi.sh/code is a simple shell script I'm using to try to verify that the cron job is running.   Is there something different I need to do if I'm trying to create a crontab entry for root? I've been looking around and I haven't seen anything about crontab that's particular to the root user.   Any help would be appreciated!  <answer120472> Your commands should actually work, however it's not as I would do it.  Instead try :-  precodesudo crontab -e -u root /code/pre  then to list :-  precodesudo crontab -l -u root /code/pre  As a general rule I go to a great deal of trouble to strongnever/strong run a root shell. When I do I use codesudo -s/code rather than codesudo su/code.  When you exit from vi you should see two lines :-  precodecrontab: no crontab for root - using an empty one crontab: installing new crontab /code/pre  If you don't get those two lines you have serious troubles. If you do and then the list command doesn't show anything I would suspect permission troubles.  I also wouldn't use your example line as you are asking the system to run "sayhi.sh" once a minute all day, every day. I also wonder about the path "/sayhi.sh" - do you really have the script right up the top of your boot drive? That's not a good idea either or do you perhaps mean "~/sayhi.sh" which in this case would be in roots home directory (usually /var/root) or do you mean emyour/em home directory. In crontab files it's best to explicitly code the entire path, regardless.  You do also realise that tany output of the cron job will not go to any terminal but will instead be emailed to root (by default).  If you want to check that cron is running tasks a simple  precode*/5 * * * *   echo "CRON" &gt; /Users/myname/.cronout /code/pre  will do that (the first field runs the task a much more reasonable every 5 minutes).  The crontabs themselves are stored in /usr/lib/cron/tabs. code/usr/lib/cron/code is actually a link to code/var/at/code and if you go there you will find the codetabs/code directory and also the codecron.deny/code file. Check that nobody has added root to that and if you still have no joy then you might try :  precodeecho &gt; /var/at/tabs/root /code/pre  which should create an empty file that you might then be able to edit.  <comment140496> does ~ work in crontab - I would always give the full path <comment140497> @Mark - yes it does. It goes to the home of the crontab owner, but like you I always fully encode paths in crontabs (and shell scripts and bash functions). <comment140498> @TonyWilliams, the 'sayhi.sh' at the root level and the every minute is purely for testing purposes. The actual shell script I want to run is in my home folder and will eventually run at a monthly interval. I'll give your suggestions a try. Thanks! <comment140549> Hmm, so I've gone through and set up my root's crontab job the way you suggest (thanks for pointing out those sudo flags btw), though when I write and quit the root crontab it still gives me the message `crontab: no crontab for root` and does not save the job entry. You mentioned that it may be a permissions issue, do you have a suggestion on which file's permissions I should check? The idea of the root user not having permissions to a particular file seems odd, doesn't it? <comment140611> I would boot off another disk and run "Fix permissions" in Disk Utility. <comment140827> Cool.
