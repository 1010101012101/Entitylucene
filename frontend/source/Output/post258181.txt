Dual Monitor Full Screen and notifications <body> Any idea how to consolidate apps with dual monitors and full screen?  Example: finder in left screen, mail in right screen. Left screen is not full screen with a few finder windows open. Mail is full screen in the right screen. When I empty the trash or connect to server the notification actually pops up on the right screen under Mail app... result is that you need to move to the right screen cycle to the finder then ok the notification.   Just an annoyance but would be great if there was a setting I was missing to avoid this happening!
