How to open or convert .xwd image dump? <body> I did the image dump of an X window by using code/opt/X11/bin/xwd/code, e.g.:  precodexwd -root -silent &gt; screen.xwd /code/pre  Now, how do I open this file or convert into JPEG file?  Probably I could use codepnmtojpeg/code, but it seems it is not available in Homebrew.  <answer242796> Alternatively use ImageMagick which support jpeg, png and other popular formats, example usage:  precodeimport -window root screen.jpeg /code/pre  supInstall by codebrew install imagemagick --with-x11/code/sup
