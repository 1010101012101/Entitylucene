iPhoto 9.6 -- Projects not working after upgrade <body> After upgrade to iPhoto 9.6 / Yosemite, none of the books are working in any way.  I click on them, and they highlight, but nothing happens (no freeze -- just no response).  I have tried all appropriate library reindex/rebuilds with no success.  Does anyone have a solution to extract/save the books which does not involve rebuilding / copying a full library / etc.?  <comment195690> Open the Console (not terminal) and clear the log, then open iPhoto and click on a project, paste the new log entries here so we can have a look at them. Also have you tried verify your drive and verifying permissions in Disk Utility? <comment195694> Tried verifying permissions in Disk Utility within the last week or so -- I'll run that again.  So far, nothing on the Console (though there's a ton of mdworker stuff gumming up the works, so I'll try hunting that down and verify both of those for you soon.) <comment195718> Permissions are all fine on second run (printer driver issues on first pass), still same problem.  Will get back to you with Console data, if any.    To clarify, when I click on the books, the book icon highlights, but otherwise the display remains unchanged (whatever album was previously selected still shows, and there's no spinning wheel or anything). <comment195720> Open Photos in finder, right click `iPhoto Library` and click show package contents.  Make a copy of the `ProjectCache` folder then delete it.  Try opening a book again. <comment195727> Nothing different -- intriguingly, though, ProjectCache doesn't recreate itself when I try to open a book. <comment195728> By the way, thank you so much for the ideas so far! <comment195729> One new thing from the console:  com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.PhotoApps.AVCHDConverter) Unknown key for dictionary: EnvironmentVarialbles
