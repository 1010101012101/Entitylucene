How do I invoke a service using Applescript? <body> I'm using Circus Ponies NoteBook which doesn't support Applescript methods.  It does support creating services that can clip the current selection into a NoteBook page.  This allows me to select text and use the context menu to paste the text into a NoteBook page.  I'd like to do the exact same thing from an Applescript script.  Is there some way in Applescript to get a handle to an existing service, and send it a message?  <answer95489> Automator services can be run with the codeautomator/code command line utility:  precodedo shell script "automator ~/Library/Services/test.workflow -i input -d variable=value" /code/pre  I couldn't get it to work with the service used by Circus Ponies NoteBook though.  <answer95536> If you assign the service a keyboard shortcut through strongSystem Preferences/strong » strongKeyboard/strong » strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong » strongServices/strong,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfNdh.png" alt="assign a keyboard shortcut"  you can then use the AppleScript strongkeystroke/strong command to invoke that shortcut.
