WIFI and Bluetooth not connecting at same time..on my Tauras keyboard <body> I have the iPad 2 and it has always worked, however, I have had it paired with the WIFI and Bluetooth and it has worked for 2 years, for the past week it will not connect the Tauras AKB34 keyboard to the Bluetooth and the WIFI  at the same time.  I am unable to use the keyboard, but the iPad 2 still works manually. I have tried everything I know and nothing works.  I cannot find any battery to change on the keyboard, if there is one. Thanks for your help, Nancy Doyle  Maine.  <answer183308> It should have come with a charger, or you can use USB cable.   It has a rechargeable battery.  The keyboard has an internal battery thatâ€™s charged with the included miniUSB cable.  <comment218486> It has to have a battery....keep looking...and that is a Targus , not Taurus. Taurus is a car made by Ford and sold in Europe (mainly Germany)
