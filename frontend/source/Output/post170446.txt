Yosemite - Sleep Wake Failure - MBP Late 2013 <body> I have the following MBP which is currently running Yosemite V10.10.2  MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013) Processor: 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M 2048 MB  Ever since I upgraded to Yosemite I get persistent crashes when the machine wakes from sleeping. It's very intermittent, sometimes it'll be fine for days and others it will happen a few times per day. Either way it's very frustrating.  It results in the laptop simply being switched off when I reopen the lid and I have to start again by pressing the power button. Or it has rebooted already and is back at the login prompt. Again, there is no clear pattern when either of those happens though.  The applications I run every day and are usually open when it happens are Chrome and VMWare Fusion 7 running a single VM with Windows8. I also have iPhoto and Eclipse open more often than not.  I've searched the forum and a few people seem to be experiencing similar but not exactly the same symptoms. A search on the reported code doesn't return any results. I've tried a PRAM reset but I get the same behaviour.  Is there any way of diagnosing exactly what's causing this?  Many thanks, Lee  The Problem Report lists the following details:  Date/Time:       2015-02-03 20:44:27 +0000 OS Version:      10.10.2 (Build 14C109) Architecture:    x86_64h Report Version: 21 Event:           Sleep Wake Failure Steps:           1 Hardware model:  MacBookPro11,3 Active cpus:     8  ================================================================ Code: 0x13006c00br Model: MacBookPro11,3, BootROM MBP112.0138.B14, 4 processors, Intel Core i7, 2.3 GHz, 16 GB, SMC 2.19f12 Graphics: Intel Iris Pro, Intel Iris Pro, Built-In Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, PCIe, 2048 MB Memory Module: BANK 0/DIMM0, 8 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x02FE, - Memory Module: BANK 1/DIMM0, 8 GB, DDR3, 1600 MHz, 0x02FE, - AirPort: spairport_wireless_card_type_airport_extreme (0x14E4, 0x134), Broadcom BCM43xx 1.0 (7.15.159.13.12) Bluetooth: Version 4.3.2f6 15235, 3 services, 27 devices, 1 incoming serial ports Network Service: Thunderbolt Ethernet, Ethernet, en4 Network Service: Wi-Fi, AirPort, en0 PCI Card: Apple 57762-A0, Ethernet Controller, Thunderbolt@195,0,0 Serial ATA Device: APPLE SSD SM0512F, 500.28 GB USB Device: Internal Memory Card Reader USB Device: Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad USB Device: BRCM20702 Hub USB Device: Bluetooth USB Host Controller Thunderbolt Bus: MacBook Pro, Apple Inc., 17.1 Thunderbolt Device: Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, Apple Inc., 1, 5.5  NOTE: ALSO POSTED ON APPLE FORUM: https://discussions.apple.com/message/27605945#27605945
