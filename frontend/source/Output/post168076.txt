How do I remove a directory that has a file with colon in it <body> I am trying to delete a directory with coderm -rf/code however I keep getting the error codeDirectory not empty/code.  If I do an codels/code on the directory I see this message codels: HTML : CSS: No such file or directory/code.  So it sounds like there's a file or directory that has a colon in it. Is there anyway I can delete that file or directory with the colon in it?  <answer168086> Assuming it is on your local drive  precoderm DIRECTORY/*\:* /code/pre  should remove the file.  <answer168087> cd to the directory and type rm, press space, then tab. Autocomplete will fill the command with the folder name using the correct escaping to select the folder. You can then delete the folder by running the command.  <comment201151> Is your problem fully solved?
