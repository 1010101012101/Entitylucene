Why do no external iPad/iPhone batteries charge via a dock connector? <body> There are many external battery packs which have a USB port for charging your iPad or iPhone on the go. But they all seem to be charged via a Micro USB port themselves, rather than a dock connector.  Why?  Is there some technical reason or does Apple not license the female dock connector?  <answer42958> Actually, many do.  Here's one example, and here's another.  The reason is probably licensing.  Apple charges a fee for developing products using this connector, and I believe there's also a very small per-port royalty (as with FireWire).  <comment48828> Oy vey, why the down vote? <comment48932> They're iPhone-only "battery cases", but it's a good start. Got a link for an external battery pack (~4000mAh) you can charge an iPad off? <comment49104> Sure - I've used this one for a couple years; works well: http://www.newtrent.com/IMP50D-dual-USB-5000mAh-iphone-battery-p/imp50d.htm <comment49166> Ah, that pack charges *itself* off Micro USB, which is not what I wanted. I want an external battery pack which charges itself from a dock connector socket. <comment49219> What's the point, other than 1 less cable to carry and a higher product price? <comment49459> ... and one less charger, which is a pretty big point. <comment49583> Not necessarily so.  The NewTrent device comes only with a USB cable, and works off the iPad's charger. <comment49588> Good to hear. But I would still prefer that one less cable, if only then for aesthetic (in the very Apple-esque "not just how it looks" sense) reasons.
