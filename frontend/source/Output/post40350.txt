How can I screen share and use Pages? <body> Via Remote Management (VNC) I am connecting to a strongvirtual/strong display on a Mac running Lion. VNC is working as expected, except Pages '09 documents show up blank. If, however VNC connects to the Mac and controls the strongphysical/strong display then Pages documents show up as expected.  Is it possible to use Pages using a virtual display over VNC?  VNC Clients that I've tested are: TightVNC &amp; RealVNC running on Windows, or Apple's Screen Sharing app on Lion.  <answer44129> Excuse the large picture, but I have used Screen Sharing to share the screen of an iMac running Lion and Pages '09 over the virtual display, and it works just fine.  I suspect that the assumed problem of with pages inability to work over a virtual VNC connection is not accurate, but there is something more local to your machine that needs attention.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/39RRt.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment45642> What sort of computer are you VNCing from and what app are you using to do so? What version of OS X is running on the Mac that is running Pages? What version of Pages is it? <comment45650> Clarifications added. The behavior seems like Pages is limiting it's use to the physical display only. <comment45651> What do you mean by a "virtual display"? I've used Pages over VNC before, but only with the laptop open and Pages on the physical display. <comment45658> "Virtual display" is new in Lion, it allows a remote user to login into a separate session and not take over the local user's physical display. This page from Apple in the section named "Lion Screen Sharing" provides some information http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4715 <comment45663> Huh. Cool feature I'd never heard of. It sounds like a bug in Pages's rendering. Does any other app do that, too, particularly Keynote or Numbers? <comment50358> I have tried using several of our Mac's in the office. We are running iWork that was purchased from physical media instead of the app store. Other than changing that I can't think of any configuration changes. How are you establishing the connection, simply Finder Share screen? <comment50359> Exactly that.  Also using CD versions of iWork.  Computers, eh!?
