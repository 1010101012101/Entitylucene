How to mass delete emails <body> I have an iPhone 4 and when I try to update the IOS I get a message that the update requires at least 5.3 GB of storage. I also says that I can more storage by deleting items in Usage Settings such as Messages, email, etc.  I have 6681 emails in my inbox.    How can I delete them without having to select them one at a time?  <comment195374> Who provides your email? (google, yahoo, etc...) Are you looking to keep using that mail on the iOS device or just remove it entirely? <comment195378> That is not much space but ever bit helps. 7000 emails at average 50k each (unless you have huge attachments) = 350000 kb (0.35 GB) <comment195381> I think if you do the install via iTunes you will not have the problem. <comment195449> It needs about 1GB of phone storage if you do it via iTunes [I had to do one recently so this is fresh in my head.] It said it wanted about 650MB but I had to clear it to about 1GB before it would actually work.
