How to play AVI files on MacBook Pro <body> Using GoPro software, I had imported videos to PC. However when I bought a new macbook pro, I transferred all files onto an external Hard Drive. They are currently in .avi format. I am struggling to play the video files on the MacBook, as the file type is not supported.   How can i play code.avi/code files ?  <answer148493> VideoLAN's VLC is the way to go here, I haven't found a movie file that it can't play.   <answer148556> You could, also, convert them to mp4/m4v using Handbrake, which is free.  <comment174893> Use (download) the VLC player.
