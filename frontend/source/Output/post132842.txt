Where can I download Xcode (n) Beta? <body> I want to start developing in Swift. I already own an apple developer account, yet am struggling to download Xcode (n) beta.  How can I do this?  Thank you in advance.  <answer132843> If you are an Apple Developer for iOS or Mac OS X, which is $99 a year, go to the Xcode page and scroll down to Xcode 6.  If you are already signed into the Apple developer portal, you can download the Xcode disk image.  <answer132874> ol liGo to https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action/li liLog in /li liLook right above the strongResources for iOS 7/strong header you'll see the strongiOS 8 beta/strong pill.

Reference #171.5fc257b8.1402063673.a946aac  The URL it's trying to access is:  http://adcdownload.apple.com//wwdc_2014/xcode_6_beta_ie8g3n/xcode_6_beta.dmg  I've looked everywhere to see if there's some t&amp;c that I need to accept first but there are no indications (I don't see any yellow info boxes, aside from the box about backing up your ios devices). Any ideas?  <answer138648> Xcode 6 beta is available to anyone that signs up for a free developer account at https://developer.apple.com/programs/which-program/ and scroll to the bottom of the page.  Paid developers get distribution and code signing certificates, but you can start with Swift and the beta Xcode 6 for free. More details are on the developer news and the Apple swift blog:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/news/?id=07112014a/li lihttps://developer.apple.com/swift//li lihttps://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/li /ul  The last link with resources has books, guides, sample code and links to the latest Xcode betas as well as WWDC videos covering the language and using it with Cocoa and other Apple API.  <answer139193> This has changed. The better place to download Xcode 6 Beta (as of Beta 3), is the Apple Swift resources page.  <answer140239> I just downloaded it from here: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/  <answer146747> If u want Xcode 6 SDK go through this below link. Your registered apple developer.   https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#  <comment157308> What does struggling to download mean? <comment157345> Aren't you missing a step between 6 and 7? <comment157366> @waldrumpus, Nah, he'll just clone Flappy Bird. <comment157367> @Klikerko  https://github.com/fullstackio/FlappySwift <comment157412> I'm on that page, and signed into iOS developer center, but there are no links on the page you linked to for downloading Xcode 6. Can you elaborate? <comment157436> That's exactly what I had to do :) <comment157549> @CharlieS you will need to click on `iOS 8 Beta` first <comment157761> You could start a new Q&A if you can't find the link to apple support for developers. If your account has issues, you might need them to look into it. It seems unlikely that the download servers are overloaded, but perhaps that is still happening or there is an outage now? <comment163592> The link is incorrect and will break as new betas are released. Better to use the resources guide in my answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/138648/5472 and https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/resources <comment163593> Fun fact: if you have a university development account, it won't let you download XCode 6 (or any beta software for that matter). I don't know why they do it. <comment163594> If you have a university account, you canâ€™t participate in the forums either, if recall. <comment163595> That's not very fun. <comment163596> The free developer account restriction has been lifted. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/132843/5472 <comment164167> Login is still required. <comment164174> @GeorgeGarside Yes but you don't need the paid developer account now <comment164305> I think the links have changed however the information is correct. I am downloading Xcode 6 beta 3 as we speak and I have the free dev account. Try this link https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/ <comment164344> @styfle thanks. Feel free to edit things like that on the answer going forward :) <comment172890> Which step of the struggling does your answer address?
