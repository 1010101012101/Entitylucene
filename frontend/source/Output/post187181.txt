Will Mac Mini i5 OSX 10.7.5 Boot in 64 Bit Mode <body> Considering buying a mid 2011 Mini i5 OSX 10.7.5 (16GB) to run Lightroom 6/CC and Photoshop CC.  They require 64 bit systems.  My Air (4GB) doesn't have enough RAM to run efficiently. Will the Mini boot in 64 bit as is, will I need to hold down 6 + 4 during start up, or do I need to upgrade to Yosemite?  <answer187190> If you run this simple command in Terminal it will show you  precodesystem_profiler   /code/pre  Even more direct method is to use the:  precodesysctl hw.cpu64bit_capable /code/pre  It will return 1=Yes, or 0 = no  <comment221197> Everything from a Core 2 Duo upwards is 64bit, so you can certainly download the 64bit no problem.
