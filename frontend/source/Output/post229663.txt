Getting all windows returns inaccurate items <body> I noticed when getting all windows that there are extra window items returned than there are. For example for Safari, it returns 9 windows but there are only 3 windows open; all the others are randomly created as far as I can tell. Below is screenshot of properties of on of these windows.  The code I used was very straightforward:  precodetell application "Safari"     set allWindows to get windows # Below is code that you can run to get these windows if they exist.     set imaginaryWindows to {}     repeat with i from 1 to (count of allWindows)         if name of (item i of allWindows) is equal to "" then             copy (item i of allWindows) to end of imaginaryWindows         end if     end repeat  log (count of imaginaryWindows) end tell /code/pre  I was wondering if anyone else have these windows? If yes, then what are they, and why do they exist? Is it a bug?  I've also noticed this being the case for Terminal, and Script Editor windows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YXB8.png" alt="Fake Window"  <comment281469> All I can add is yes, I get some imaginary windows - *but*, not straight after launch [even if everything is set to restore the last session]. Perhaps it's remembering windows opened then closed? Edit - nope, after a second test it *did* remember a phantom after a fresh launch... bang goes my theory ;) <comment281531> @Tetsujin Thanks for confirming that, I was going nuts here.
