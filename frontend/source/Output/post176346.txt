Pop up on Mac from AVG <body> I installed AVG antivirus then  deleted it using the AVG website.  I keep getting popups on my iMac using Yosemite 10.10 stating Problem Report for Loader Agent. The popup persists even though the program has been deleted properly. The path to the file is: codeLibrary/Application Support/AVG/*/LoaderAgent.app./Contents/MacOS//code.  AVG support has not been helpful to delete the popup.  Please advise.   <answer176368> Did you uninstall it with the uninstaller, or drag it to the trash?     strongTo uninstall AVG Antivirus for Mac:/strong        ol   liRun the AVG AntiVirus for Mac.  /li   liClick the AVG AntiVirus Menu bar, and then click Uninstall AVG AntiVirus.  /li   liClick Uninstall AVG AntiVirus.  /li   liFollow the AVG AntiVirus Uninstaller to finish the uninstallation process.

So download the installer and use the uninstaller in the dmg. It removes the LoaderAgent.app and supplemental files and folders.  strongJust for record keeping, my earlier answer:/strong     Which AVG Antivirus did you install? Did you get the installer package from a reliable source?      The latest AVG Antivirus for Mac doesn't create a folder named AVG in /Library/Application Support/ - at least for me using the free installer and not subscribing to any additional services or installing AVG Cleaner or PrivacyFix. Instead the folder is named com.avg.Antivirus. Especially it doesn't contain a LoaderAgent.app in any of the subfolders. Moreover I can't uninstall it "using the AVG website".      To get rid of the remnants of your AVG deinstallation, download and install "LaunchControl"      Open the app and search for avg in Global Agents/Global Daemons.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wdQDR.png" alt="launch"      Uncheck all radio buttons to disable the jobs      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ovnX.png" alt="launch2"      Quit LaunchControl, go to /Library/LaunchAgents and /Library/LaunchAgents, check for plists containing avg and open Terminal.app      Enter codesudo launchctl unload &lt;-Drop the *.plist here/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd to unload all related services. If the plist is a symbolic link or an alias right-click it and choose "Show Original" and use the original plist. You have to enter an admin password then.   Repeat that for every plist containing *.avg.      Then enter codesudo rm &lt;-Drop the *.plist here/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd   Repeat that for every plist containing *.avg.      Navigate to /Library/Application Support/ with   codecd /Library/Application\ Support/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd.      Then enter codesudo rm -dfR AVG/code and hit kbdEnter/kbd.      Restart your Mac.
