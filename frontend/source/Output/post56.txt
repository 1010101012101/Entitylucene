How do I turn off the Front Row keyboard shortcut? <body> I keep accidentally hitting kbdCommand/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd and bringing up Front Row. How can I disable this shortcut?  <answer62> Under strongKeyboard &amp; Mouse/strong on System Preferences there is a emKeyboard Shortcuts/em tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NNvPI.jpg" alt="System preferences"  <comment23> Wow. that's a classic screenshot: 10.2 or 10.3 era. <comment28> @Chealion: Yes it is. <comment57> In Snow Leopard, it's no longer “Keyboard & Mouse,” just “Keyboard.” (Mouse has its own preference pane.) You can select “Front Row” from the list of applications on the left, then uncheck the “Hide and show Front Row” entry, or reassign to a different key combination. <comment98> Sweet, thanks everyone! <comment35344> Also, in Lion there is no Front Row, which helps remove the problem via the back door :)
