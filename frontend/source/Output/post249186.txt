Black bars on external display <body> I am connecting my 2015 MacBook Air 13" to an external display via the Thunderbolt-to-VGA adapter.  There are black bars on each side of the external display screen.  How can I remove the bars?br   ol liMacbook Air 13" (Early 2015)/li liLG Flatron E2360/li liDell Thunderbolt to VGA Adapter./li /ol  <answer249188> I had this exact issue with a Thunderbolt to VGA adapter and an Acer display on my MBP.  It was showing up as a projector, not a monitor, with black bars and low resolution. I simply plugged it into the other Thunderbolt and MBP recognized it as a 720p display.   Maybe also try updating OS X with adapter plugged in (this may force MBA to download a driver). Or downloading driver from manufacturer website. I would verify that the cables are properly connected too.   <comment309028> On the sides of your display or computer? Try `System Preferences  Displays`, and uncheck 'mirror displays.' <comment309031> The trouble is MBA has only 1 Thunderbolt Port. :) <comment309033> on the sides of the external display. 'mirror displays' is already unchecked <comment309040> Have you rebooted, tried a PRAM reset <comment309103> did reset the PRAM, the issue still persists
