What causes me to be unable to burn Windows 7 ISO due to a medium error? <body> I've just upgraded my 2011 17" MacBook Pro with a brand spankin' new SSD hard drive and 8GB of RAM. In order to fully maximize the potential of the system, I'd like to install Windows 7 to take full advantage of the specs.  That being said, when I downloaded the Windows 7 ISO from Digital River, I was unable to burn it through Disk Utility. The burn failed due to a medium error, and I can't figure out why.  It's a brand new spindle of DVD-Rs, granted it's a brand I've never heard of, but I was able to burn a couple other items using them, so I'm at a loss as to what's going on here.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  <answer60529> Looks like it was the oddball brand (Ativa) causing the issues. Bought a spindle of Maxell discs and it's burning like a charm.  <comment69603> Did you try more than once? <comment69610> Yes. I tried more than once with several different discs, and it always ended up with the same results. <comment69624> Which brand? Did you try other bootable images? I once used a Chinese brand which could burn everything except bootable disks fine. <comment69630> The brand name escapes me at the moment (as I said, it was a brand I've never encountered before). And no, I didn't try any other bootable images for lack of need of any other bootable images. <comment69631> If thatâ€™s the case, then I highly recommend trying to burn another bootable image, for it will reveal whether the DVD-R is to blame for the mess you have got yourself in. <comment69632> A valid suggestion. I'll give it a shot with an Ubuntu image when I get home.
