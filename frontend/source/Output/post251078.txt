Dualboot OSX/Kali linux flashing underscore during boot <body> I have a 2012 MacBook Pro with a 480 GB SSD + a 500 GB hard drive (instead of default superdrive).  I have rEFInd installed on my OS X (SSD).  I have installed Kali Linux on my HD, to boot into Kali Live and install Kali I have added emedd=off/em to make it work.  Everything seems good, but when I'm trying to boot into Kali on rEFInd, I get a black screen with a white flashing underscore, nothing more.  So I think is because I need to add emedd=off/em option during Kali boot, like I did to boot Kali Live and the installer.  How can I add this option to the boot when Kali is chosen in rEFInd? I need to add it every time I want to boot into Kali? Or I need to add it into a specific rEFInd file I can find on OS X?  <comment312033> FYI: If you post your rEFInd questions at [superuser](http://superuser.com), generally you will get an answer from the Rod Smith. He is the current maintainer  of the rEFInd software. <comment312034> Ah ok thanks for this info
