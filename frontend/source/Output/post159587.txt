How to configure Apple's podcast app to limit clutter & centralize control in iTunes <body> I would like to know how to set up the Apple podcast app to remove clutter (on the phone) and centralize all controls on the computer's iTunes client. Basically I am trying to replicate the workflow I was using before the podcast app. So I want to :br 1) download the podcasts on the computer in the iTunes clientbr 2) transfer the latest 10 episodes on the phonebr 3) remove from the phone any mention of podcasts that are subscribed but that do not have new contentbr 4) remove from the phone any mention of podcasts that are subscribed but which new content wasn't yet downloaded.br Is there a way to do that?
