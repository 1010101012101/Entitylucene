Can I start A New and delete All I've previously done <body> A kid next door was bought a 2nd hand IPad and he can't download games because he doesn't have Apple ID so I share mine. But because of some security reason I decided to change my email and password. And now I can't connect to some application. Verification always pop-up even though I already verified the account. Is there a way to change the whole thing and start anew.  <comment174937> Does it still works under the "old" Apple ID ?
