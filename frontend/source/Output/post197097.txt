Send key for message when using Bluetooth keyboard <body> I am using iOS 8 and a Apple Bluetooth Keyboard. I cannot find the key combination to send a message in Messages. For example, Mail has Command + Shift + D, Facebook has Command + Return. Anyone know the shortcut for messages?   <answer197298> Unfortunately, this is not possible. In previous versions of iOS you could change a setting in Keyboards, however it doesn't seem to work in iOS 8. Sorry :(  <answer248986> Try it now. I have iOS9.3.3 in use on my iPad and kbdCommand/kbd kbdShift/kbd kbdD/kbd sent my email in the Mail app with no problem.
