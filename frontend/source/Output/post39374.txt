Generate an iOS Project (.xcodeproj) with AppleScript <body> How can I generate an iOS project (.xcodeproj) with AppleScript (without XCode)?  <answer39390> You could create an empty iOS Xcode project once, put it somewhere on your disk, and then use an AppleScript to copy the folder (.xcodeproj is basically just a folder) to the desired destination.  (But I can't think of a single use for this...)  <comment44514> What do you mean "generate an iOS project"? What is the functionality of your desired outcome? <comment44515> I wish to create an empty iOS project. <comment44535> I am searching a solution to automate the creation of projects.
