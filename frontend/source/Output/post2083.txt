Recording iPad Video Output on Mac <body> I'd like to record video output from my iPad on my Mac.  I know there is a VGA output adapter for the iPad.  What hardware and software do I need on the Mac side?  Details:  ul liI have a two-year-old iMac and year-old MacBook.  I can use either one for the recording./li liI will be recording an iPad app that has support for video output (it's an app I'm developing myself)/li liI don't care much about what the final video format is.  Ideally, QuickTime, but really anything displayable on a Mac is fine./li /ul  Alternatively, if there is a much easier/cheaper way to record on a Windows box rather than Mac, I could do that too.  <answer2084> There's a guide here you might find helpful. The guide suggests using the iPad VGA connector and a VGA to USB converter. The suggested converter is a bit steep at $299, but you might be able to find a cheaper alternative.
