Change completion key in TextMate? <body> Is it possible to change the completion key (escape) to command for instance? How?  <answer4724> From the same question asked on SO:  To remap the kbdesc/kbd key you have to copy  code/Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Resources/KeyBindings.dict/code  to  code~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/KeyBindings.dict/code  and then edit it, preferably using TextMate :) as Property List Editor messes up the codes.   Look for nextCompletion and previousCompletion and replace their values with whatever suits your needs best.   For example, you could replace kbd\033/kbd (code for kbdesc/kbd) to kbd-|tab/kbd.  <comment4617> both \t and -| can be esoteric to individuals. Could you change `-|` to `-| tab`? <comment4620> @VxJasonxV - no problem. Done.
