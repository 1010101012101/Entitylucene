How to open files via Terminal <body> I want to open videos and pictures from Terminal. Is there any way to do this?  <answer212585> To open any file from the command line with the default application, just type codeopen/code followed by the filename/path.  Example:  precodeopen ~/Desktop/filename.mp4 /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong as per Johnny Drama's comment below, if you want to be able to open files in a certain application, put code-a/code followed by the application's name in quotes between codeopen/code and the file.  Example:  precodeopen -a "QuickTime Player" ~/Desktop/filename.mp4 /code/pre  If you need further information about the codeopen/code command, type codeman open/code.  <comment256674> What is this? questions should be stand alone and not depend on other sites <comment256677> this question is dependent on stackexchange website. If thats not allowed I can recopy complete stuff from that site to this site. <comment256678> yaa this worked thanks. <comment256679> I edited the question so it stands on its own. It didn't require external information. <comment256680> Please and explain what you want to do in user terms not just the ebonite command - and note the edit to improve the text has lost the link so you need to edit <comment256681> @Mark I got answer. Thanks anyways. <comment256730> Just to complete this answer: With timotyhm's command you will open the file with the default application for this filetype. If you want to open any file with a specific application, just enter: `open -a "Application" /Path/to/file`. Example: `open -a "Adobe Photoshop CC 2014" ~/Desktop/test.psd`. See `man open` for more information. <comment256771> @JohnnyDrama Good point. Can I edit that into my answer? <comment317861> The collaboration in answers is awesome. Johnny Drama's answer is what I really wanted, but the title is what I searched. Answers like these are why I love StackExchange!
