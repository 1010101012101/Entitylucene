How to cd to a directory with a name starting with a "-" (minus)? <body> We have some folders where the names are starting with a "-". If I try to enter them with terminal, codecd/code interprets the "-" as an option. How could I manage this?  <answer277024> This should just work:  precodecd /path/to/-folderthatstartswithdash /code/pre  strongEDIT/strong:  According to this question, this works if you only want to input the name:  precodecd -- -folderthatstartswithdash /code/pre  <answer277025> precodecd ./-folder /code/pre  usually works quite well here (and also with other commands)  <answer277036> Putting the name in quotes should work.  <comment348726> One would be wise to avoid such characters in directory/folder names. <comment348727> Why would that work? How is the utility going to know the difference? Quoting is done by the shell, after all, the arguments array the utility receive will be *exactly the same* either way. I admit that I didn't try your solution, but from what little I know about shells, it seems pretty self-evident, that this *cannot possibly* work. <comment348737> This should work on Windows IIRC, and is what I thought of first, but I can confirm that it doesn't work on mac. <comment348755> If it works on Windows that's only because Windows' command line model is utterly ridiculous and inconsistent. Or just because Windows commands aren't treating `-` as an option character. But there's no way quoting should be able to change this behavior. <comment348767> The `--` method is the correct answer... it will work with most standard utilities that accept a filename as an argument and saves having to fully qualify the path. <comment348771> Couldn't you just do `cd '-my-directory'`? <comment348773> The `--` method works as it "turns off" argument parsing. <comment348799> Why the restriction "if you only want to input the name"? If you need more arguments, just put them before the `--`. <comment348806> @oldbunny2800 Did you try that? <comment348810> @FedericoPoloni I'm just saying if you don't want the full path you can use this one. All other arguments should go before the --. <comment348820> @OldBunny2800 No. Quotes prevent the shell from treating characters separately; strings starting with hyphens are treated as options (or not) by the command that *receives* the arguments, regardless of how those strings were presented to the shell. <comment348874> @patrix I did right after I posted the comment, then got distracted by other terminal shenanigans, then forgot about my comment. :) Chepner ohhh, that makes more sense. <comment349449> One nice thing about this solution is that it works with any program or command, not just 'cd'; it does not depend on the command or program having any special behavior like "--" to turn change the interpretation of subsequent arguments.
