Sync iOS5 reminders between people using iCloud <body> How can Reminders in iOS5 be shared between two iCloud accounts?  In other words, how can two users send or post to other users a Reminder?  <answer37153> This is not possible. You will have to have to be logged into the same iCloud account on both devices for it to work.  <answer37163> strongThe other user (@Paul) is incorrect/strong! Create a list that you want to share using your iCloud account. On your Mac, click "Reminders" to the side of the calendar view in iCal. Right-click on the calendar you want to share, then click "Share Reminder List..." On the menu that appears, select "Only the people you invite" and click Ok.  Easy and effective!
