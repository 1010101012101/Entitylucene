Install iPhoto '9 on Mountain Lion <body> I just received my new iMac, with Moutain Lion and iLife 11 preinstalled.  I also own an older Mac, for which I bought a few years ago Snow Leopard and iLife 09.  Now, I want to get rid of iPhoto 11 and reinstall my good old iPhoto 9 as I like it much better.  I tried to reinstall it with the iLife'09 DVD I have, but the installer doesn't let me install iPhoto (and iMovie), but would let me install iWeb.  Is there a workaround so that I can use iPhoto 09 on my new iMac ?  <answer83079> According to a similar thread on Apple Discussions, yes, iPhoto does work on 10.8. Try deleting the troublesome applications - and that way they should install. What do you mean 'it won't let you install iPhoto'? How doesn't it let you install it?  <answer83345> I finally found a way to install iPhoto '09 on my brand new iMac with Mountain Lion :  From the iLife installer, with the contextual menu, I ask to display the content of the codeiLife '09.pkg/code package.  I do this until I reach the iPhoto package (codeiPhoto.pkg/code). I also ask to display the content of this package and double-clic on the file codeArchive.pax.gz/code. This uncompress it and creates an codeApplications/code folder into which is the codeiPhoto/code app.  I copied the iPhoto app in my system's codeApplications/code folder.  Then, still in the iLife 09 installer, I installed the codeiLifeSlideShow.pkg/code.  And now, finally, iPhoto '09 is running fine !  <comment95949> The iLife installer, is working but is only installing iWeb and iDvd (not iPhoto and iMovie). I then tried to do a customized install, but iPhoto and iMovie are grayed out and cannot be selected. <comment95952> That's great - I was just going to tell you to do that but you beat me to it :D  Make sure you mark this question as the answer to your question so that it's easier to track.
