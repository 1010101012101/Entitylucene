Why can't my spotlight open any application? <body> I can search and find anything on Spotlight, so I think my index works. However, when I try to open an application, even terminal, I just get a spinning beach ball until Spotlight disappears. Why am I having this problem?  <comment265937> There are probably more details required to get to the bottom of this. Does the problem occur directly after a reboot as well? Did you try to rebuild your Spotlight index? Is there anything of interest in /var/log/system.log? If you change to another user (create one if necessary), does the same problem occur there? <comment265939> Actually my log says this `Dec 16 11:48:05 JonatharantsMBP coreduetd[65]: CoreData: error: (11) Fatal error.  The database at /var/db/CoreDuet/coreduetd.db is corrupted.
