Remount a network home directory without logging out <body> Looking for a means of reconnecting a network home directory without having to log out and back in. Unfortunately due to server maintenance or even sleep issues with the client, the network home directory connection is lost.  <comment215191> What OS(es)? What Protocol? <comment215193> It is connecting back to a Windows 2008 R2 server over SMB. <comment215196> 'it' isâ€¦. still rather shy on information... <comment215200> Why can'y you just reconnect - i.e. click no the drive in the Finder sidebar (i.e. there is more info you need to give us on how you normally connect and what you can't do this) <comment215201> Sorry, the "it" is a 10.10.2 box. The drive is mounted through directory services bind tool that allows you to specify the home directory as smb:// <comment215202> The drive only appears in the dock as a question mark and is not visible either as a connected or disconnected drive in Finder. <comment215363> Are you connecting as ip/share or name/share? Is the sever guaranteed to win the master browser election every time? Macs over SMB are notorious for forcing an election & winning, when they shouldn't. <comment215711> It's connecting to a name/share combination. My issue that the file server will briefly disappear from the network during server backups and then clients can be left with a question mark as their home directory in the dock. Starting to think this is unsolvable without a login/logout.
