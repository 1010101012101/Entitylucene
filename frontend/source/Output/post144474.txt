mds and mds_stores constantly consuming cpu <body> mds and mds_stores are constant CPU consumers even when I think nothing should have changed on the hard drive.   Activity Monitor:  img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/6095b2c9-3fd1-49f1-a614-18a3eb39ad7f/478686e6e3de65131b4edcb0dcf4492a/deep/0/Screen-Shot-2014-09-07-at-2.11.05-PM.png" alt="activity monitor"  I have a circa 2009 Macbook Pro. Lots of software installed over the years. Dropbox and Crashplan are active background process among many others.  I have included many locations in the privacy settings of Spotlight.  ul liUSB drive/li liCrashplan folder /li licode/Library/Caches/code/li licode/Users/me/Library/Caches/code/li /ul  Still, mds and mds_stores are constant consumers of CPU hovering around 10-12% each. My fan keeps running due to the heat.  Any ideas as to what it could be due and how I can troubleshoot?  <answer144494> As you know the mds and mds_stores are Spotlight activities.  The reason why your Spotlight is so active could be a number of things.  It could be you have an app or multiple apps constantly changing some folder contents.  First let's check whether Spotlight is the cause of the fans running so much. To test this, run the following in your terminal:  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  this should result in a clear slow down of the fans.  To turn it back on, run   precodesudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  After this you could run the complete re-indexing of your hard drive (be aware this could be an over night job), it will delete your Spotlight data base forcing it to start over.  precodesudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/* /code/pre  The next and final step would be to add others to your (do not scan), privacy settings.  <answer166292> I got the same issue, almost bought me a new mac.  I checked all the stuff on the net about mds_stores etc...  All I got was terminal programming and clean installation solutions.. without guarantees of fixing the problem.  So I checked my free-to-download cleaning and maintenance tool "Onyx" and in the navigation bar under maintenance you can check "Spotlight Rebuild" (as default is unchecked).  After that I had no problems and speed was up to normal. Also, Activity Monitor stays within normal parameters. I hope it stays that way and works. For it is an easy and free tip for non-technical Mac users.  Found that out an hour ago but  looks promising. Goodluck   <answer249234> You said, "I have included many locations in the privacy settings of spotlight."br You need to include FEWER locations, not more. If you include more, that means Spotlight is keeping very busy looking at them all.br You can easily go to System Preferences/Spotlight to un-select many locations. Especially, un-select Mail, search engines, and other internet dependent options.br Shut down and restart after changing your Spotlight preferences.   <comment224305> Do you think it's an overnight operation even with an SSD? <comment224309> @Volte SSD are very fast, bit if you have very large number of files it can take a while, so the best is to let it run when you are not using the computer (overnight). <comment281462> Why would you turn down the fans? What would cause the computer to force a shut down, once it gets to hot?! <comment285059> Couldn't figure out why my spotlight was rebuilding the index. I don't have Onxy installed but I do have CleanMyMac and sure enough, it had automatically started rebuilding the index. <comment285297> The given commands don't affect the fans directly. mdutil controls mds, the Spotlight indexing daemon. Those steps verify that Spotlight is indeed causing the high-temp condition. <comment312880> For me `sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*` totally did the trick. Thank you. <comment319248> You are mistaken, in fact you have it back to front, the privacy panel of Spotlight says, and I quote: "Prevent Spotlight from searching these locations" so having fewer locations in privacy will actually cause spotlight to keep BUSIER. Having more locations unchecked in the Search Results panel will do as you say but the more you put in the privacy panel the less spotlight will search. <comment329825> The current status can be checked with `mdutil -a -s -v`. <comment339898> Yes, this is actually quite bad advice. Anything you *don't* want scanned should be in Privacy.
