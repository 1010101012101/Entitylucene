How to configure Dragon Dictate so that it does not scan files upon opening? <body> When I open a text file with TextEdit, Dragon Dictate scan the file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNAhe.png" alt="enter image description here"  It often ends up being unresponsive if the file is large. How to configure Dragon Dictate so that it does not scan files upon opening?  I use Dragon Dictate 5 with OS X 10.10. If I open the file SublimeText, I do not have this issue.  <answer226729> I was able to replicate that behavior in an earlier major version and to stop it, this is what I did.  Go to strongDragon Dictate  Preferences...  Dictation/strong and uncheck the strongTextEdit/strong check box, as shown in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QwKwT.png" alt="Dragon Dictate &gt; Preferences... &gt; Dictation"  emNote: This is from Dragon Dictate 3.0.2 and may be somewhat different in version 5, however hopefully this will help to resolve the issue./em  <comment275346> I have an earlier major version and that doesn't happen for me, probably not a feature in the version I'm running.  That said, I did check Dragon Dictate  Preferences... and saw nothing in there however since you didn't mention whether or not you looked there, well did you? <comment275347> @user3439894 same here, I didn't have this issue with Dragon Dictate 4. Dragon Dictate  Preferences is still impressively desert. <comment275349> I guess I didn't look to well the first time and upon second glance I found the setting to change to stop that behavior.  See my answer below.  I checked the TextEdit check box and then opened a 40MB text file and up came that message box... system froze... had to force quit Dragon Dictate. :)
