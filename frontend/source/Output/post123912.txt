Ad banner with my ads <body> I would like to make a banner that will display ads for my products only. Will it be ok with App Store or my app won't be approved (or cut later)?  <answer123920> The only thing I can find in the App store review guidelines is this:br strong2.25/strongbr  ul liApps that display Apps other than your own for purchase or promotion  in a manner similar to or confusing with the App Store will bebr rejected, unless designed for a specific approved need (e.g. healthbr management, aviation, accessibility, etc.) or which providebr significant added value for a specific group of customers./li /ul  But you can't make it look like the standard i-ad banner because that means you are replicating an existing apple product.br strong8.3/strongbr  ul liApps that appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product or  advertising theme will be rejected/li /ul  And you must keep in mind that the ads can't be too annoying:br strong2.13/strongbr  ul liApps that are primarily marketing materials or advertisements will be rejected/li /ul  If you follow these rules I would say go for it, it sounds to me like it is perfectly within apples rules what you are trying to do.
