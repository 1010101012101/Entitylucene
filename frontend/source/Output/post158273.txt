Weird Keyboard Problem of Macbook Pro 2011 <body> I don't know why but when I am using my 2011 Macbook Pro, there are some very weird thing happening. When I key down "{", it will automatically become "%{", when I touch the right arrow, it will automatically insert 8 into the text, and when I press 1 it will be mapped to the volume up button. do you know what is going on with it?   <comment186080> Sounds like either the wrong keyboard is being recognised, or possibly there's something physically wrong with the keyboard, dust/dirt etc. Check whether the keyboard layout looks right in system prefs  keyboard  input sources. <comment186101> Try an external keyboard.  If that works ok, it indicates that your internal one has become damaged and needs repair or replacement.  I don't know of any software issue that would cause the problems you describe. <comment186118> How do you key down the "{" ?
