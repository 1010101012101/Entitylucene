How do I keep a MacBook Air from connecting to a Bluetooth speaker when its lid is closed? <body> The MacBook Air automatically connects to a (previously paired) Bluetooth speaker even when the lid is closed, which prevents the device I'm actually using at the moment from connecting to the speaker.  How do I configure the MacBook Air to strongnot/strong automatically connect to a bluetooth speaker when the lid is closed? I want everything to work as-is when the lid is open.  <answer272244> Building on other answers and giving most/all puzzle pieces but not a whole solution:  ol liMake sure to check if you want to have Bluetooth devices wake your Mac  ul liIf you don't want that, uncheck it in system preferences and check if the undesired behaviour persist (It's in codeBluetooth/code &rarr; codeAdvanced…/code &rarr; codeAllow Bluetooth devices to wake this computer/code)/li /ul/li liIf you need/want to wake your Mac by Bluetooth devices or this keeps happening despite turning off the option follow these steps:/li /ol  Install a helper program to check for system sleep (if you want to distinguish only lid open/closed without the Mac sleeping, it seems there is currently no easy way – i.e. I didn't find out how to detect that), and toggle Bluetooth depending on sleep/wake events.  h2Helpers to detect sleep/wake (check the various options in this post):/h2  h3Possible to run scripts on sleep and wake?/h3  See also this post about "Automatically turn bluetooth on or off depending on current network (MBP running Lion)" mentioning ControlPlane  h2Toggle bluetooth from scripts:/h2  h3How to control Bluetooth wireless radio from the command line?/h3  My recommendation: install blueutil via homebrew  Run codeblueutil power 0/code upon sleep  And codeblueutil power 1/code upon wake  Now about my contribution to this problem: If power nap causes a wake event try this script for wake to distinguish between other wake reasons and lid opening:  precode#!/bin/bash limitSec=3 currentEpoch=$(date "+%s") wakeEpoch=$(cat /var/log/system.log | grep LidOpen | tail -n 1 | date -j -f "%b %d %T" "$(cut -c1-15)" "+%s") wakeSeconds=$(( $currentEpoch - $wakeEpoch ))  if [[ $wakeSeconds -lt $limitSec ]]; then     logger "Enabling bluetooth again due to lid open"     blueutil power 1 fi /code/pre  It sets a timeout of 3 seconds (limitSec), gets the current time and the last time of wake with codeWake reason: EC.lidOpen/code, and if that was less than 3 seconds ago it will re-enable Bluetooth  <comment339243> Related question concerning iOS: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/177205/why-do-bluetooth-speakers-reconnect-to-device-that-is-off?rq=1
