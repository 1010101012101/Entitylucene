Is there a way to watch Netflix instantly on an iBook G4 (powerpc) <body> I have an old iBook G4 running 10.4.11 and I want to be able to watch Netflix instantly. The problem is that Netflix only supports intel based macs. I'm curious to know if anyone has found a work around for this problem.  I have followed this tutorial to install silverlight 2 on a ppc, and that was a success. However, Netflix still doesn't allow me to stream movies. I'm trying with both Firefox and Safari. Any help is greatly appreciated!  <answer42553> Unfortunately, the answer is no.  According to Neflix, the minimum requirements are:  An Intel-based Mac with OS 10.4.11 or later Safari 3 or higher; or Firefox 3 or higher &amp; 1 GB RAM  <comment48404> Can you provide a reference link to where the requirements are for netflix, to make the answer nicer. <comment48501> IIRC, having used a G4 iBook for years, this was in part due to the lack of Microsoft Silverlight for PPC.
