connecting yosemite to wifi 5ghz networks at channels > 149 <body> this seems to be a long standing problem (link), and one that i've recently encountered on my new macbookpro11,3. i've tried all the recommended solutions (delete network profiles, network plists, deactive bluetooth, PRAM reset, SMC reset).  does any one have a solution? i can't change the name of the ssid to force 2.4ghz, nor can i change the frequency used by the access points.  <comment214107> The question is not clear, some of it seems to be in the title ... but why channel 149? If you can't connect to your 5Ghz at all, let us know. <comment214140> i've added a link: numerous users have had issues connecting to networks on 5Ghz channels  149.
