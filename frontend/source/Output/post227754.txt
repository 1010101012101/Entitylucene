How to secure my mail in iOS? <body> Can you please advise what is the best application for email encryption using iPhones and iPads?  <answer227755> It depends on the level of security you are looking for. For PGP, some options, as explained in this article, are iPGMail and oPenGP. If you are looking for a simpler option, in which you don't want to rely on the PGP web of trust, then you can use S/MIME in the stock mail app with little effort. The linked article explains the easiest way to do this on iOS.   <comment277599> [related: Email encryption options on an iPhone](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/99935/55266)
