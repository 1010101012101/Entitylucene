VirtualBox: poweroff guest on Mac shutdown/logout <body> It's possibile to easily turn on a VirtualBox VM at boot using LaunchAgents, but I haven't figured out a way to turn off my Debian VM when the Mac is turned off and/or at logout. The goal would be to run codeVBoxManage controlvm 'VM Name' acpipowerbutton/code at shutdown. I'm running macOS 10.12.6, all the examples I've found seem outdated or not working.
