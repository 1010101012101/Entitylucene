Epubs from iBooks not showing up in iTunes on Mac OS X Sierra <body> I have about a few hundred of epubs that I’d regularly been syncing on my iOS devices until I’ve updated to Sierra a few days ago, when suddenly only a few books showed up in iTunes.  I tried turning iCloud support for iBooks on/off as some people have suggested on other forums but it didn’t help.  How can I make all epubs from iBooks to show up in iTunes?  <answer262648> OK, I’ve managed to solve this with the help of another guy from Apple Suport Forum.  Here’s what I did:  ol liI Quit the iTunes/li liI opened iBooks/li liI backed up my books and PDF’s from iBooks by dragging and holding alt copying them to a backup folder/li liI deleted all of my books and PDF’s from iBooks/li liI quit the iBooks/li liI went to the Settings  iCloud  Options  iBooks and turned the iCloud support for iBooks off/li liI went to the Library folder in Finder and located the strongnsurlsessiond/strong folder via search/li liI copied the folder to the backup folder, just in case/li liI deleted the strongnsurlsessiond/strong folder/li liI shut the OS X down/li liI turned the computer on/li liI opened iBooks I moved my books and PDF’s from the backup folder to iBooks/li liI turned the iCloud support for iBooks on (see the step 6)/li liI opened iTunes/li liemVoilah!/em All of my books and PDF’s are there!/li liI synced the books successfully to both iPad 3 and iPhone 6/li liI checked the highlights, bookmarks, notes and the last page read and everything was properly syncing/li /ol  Here’s the original forum post.  <answer263468> I tried toggling iCloud iBook syncing first and had some luck but it eventually got stuck again. While exploring alternatives to deleting the nsurlsessiond folder I discovered this solution. I suspect it works without first needing to toggle iBook syncing.  strongNavigate to iBooks Folder/strong  ol liCMD+Space (Spotlight): "[name of a book in iBooks library]"/li liHighlight book and press CMD+Enter or CMD+Double Click on book. If the book exists in multiple locations you can check for the correct location (".../Mobile Documents/iBooks/iBooks/...") by highlighting an item and holding CMD to display the path in the Spotlight status bar area at the bottom)./li /ol  strongRemove and Re-add Stuck Files/strong   ol start="3" liMove all items with the unsynced iCloud icon (dotted cloud) to another folder temporarily (e.g. Desktop)./li liMove the items back to the iBooks folder. Start with one if you want to see that it works first./li liLet it sync. The iBooks iCloud badges and the Upload/Download list (available from the down-arrow button at the top-right of iBooks) should actively reflect the syncing./li /ol  <answer291459> This simple trick worked for me:  ol liGo to System Preferences  iCloud  iCloud Drive options/li liUncheck iBooks and check it again/li /ol  All the books showed up again in iBooks on the Mac and were available for syncing in iTunes.  <comment367936> Thanks so much Sinisa - not only did this fix the issue of my iBook epubs & PDFs not showing in iTunes, BUT it also fixed an issue where my phone was not syncing with the Photos App on my Mac. Only difference for me is that under System Preferences  iCloud  .. I turned off all the Photo settings here, including those under iCloud  Options. Not sure if that was necessary or not. <comment367958> Awesome, great to hear it still works :) <comment367985> I'd tried initially this but it didn't work for me.
