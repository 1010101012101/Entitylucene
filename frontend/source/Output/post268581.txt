What application uses a red cone icon with a notch in it? <body> I saw the following icons in a screen shot of a mac. I know the F-icon is Autodesk Fusion, but what is the icon next to it, the red cone with a notch?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9DLxj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268585> Open it and look at the name on the menu bar in the top left?  <answer268588> That appears to be the icon for Autodesk AutoCAD (see the red icon in the screenshot).  Here is another view.  <comment337264> This is a screenshot from a video on YouTube. This application is not on my computer. <comment337266> Ah, now we know. <comment337267> I should have guessed since Fusion is right next to it, thanks.
