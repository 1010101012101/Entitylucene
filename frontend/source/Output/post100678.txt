How to play .exe type video streamer on mac os <body> I have installed wine but the app but it doesn't seems to be working.  It's a cn type of movie player, doesn't seems to stream output video.  Any idea how to fix this?  <comment118462> What app is it exactly? I might be able to find a workaround for you <comment118469> Can you please add some more details to your question? Which exe are you trying to run via wine, how do you call it, does it just not stream or not start at all? <comment118484> The app is called funshion. It can start but not able to stream movie/page details. Sometimes it crashes.
