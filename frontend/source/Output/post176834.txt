How to connect a Mac Book Pro to a LaserWriter II NT <body> I have an Apple LaserWriter II NT from the late 80's. Is there a way how I can print to it from my MacBook Pro?   <answer176843> That machine has an AppleTalk interface - I doubt you'll find anything made in the last 20 years that can connect to it, much less drivers for it that would run under OS X.  12MHz processor &amp; 2MB RAM - I think it's also PostScript only, but I'm not certain.  The Asant√© Bridge used to be the thing to connect Ethernet to AppleTalk - but idk if the $60 asking price would be worth it these days - I did find one on Amazon, though - http://www.amazon.com/Asante-Talk-Ethernet-LocalTalk-Bridge/dp/B00004VUFW  See also - http://lowendmac.com/network/bridge.shtml  See if a museum would be interested.  <comment208915> Looking at the [Specifications](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP475?locale=en_US) you'll need a PostScript capable printer driver (which you already have in OS X) and an USB-RS-232 interface.
