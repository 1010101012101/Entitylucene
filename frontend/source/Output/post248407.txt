Sandbox on Mac OS X <body> I can't use the sandbox-exec command as I expected.  The problem is that I cannot apply a custom profile with the -f switch: I get "operation not permitted" error which I could not trace to anything useful when I searched online for a solution.  precode$ sandbox-exec -f alfred-profile.sb /Applications/Alfred.app/Contents/MacOS/Alfred  sandbox-exec: /Applications/Alfred.app/Contents/MacOS/Alfred: Operation not permitted /code/pre  It is, however, possible to run pre-defined profiles with the -n switch. The following example runs successfully (starts Alfred and does not allow the process to access the network).  precode$ sandbox-exec -n no-network /Applications/Alfred.app/Contents/MacOS/Alfred /code/pre  <answer248443> What are the contents of codealfred-profile.sb/code? I think you have denied/not explicitly allowed an operation that is required for the app to start. I would check that first, if possible.  Consider two profiles:  ol liA permissive profile, codegood_profile.sb/code:  precode(version 1) (allow default) /code/pre/li liA restrictive profile, codebad_profile.sb/code:  precode(version 1) (deny default) /code/pre/li /ol  Note: a profile just consisting of code(version 1)/code will display the same behavior, as deny is the default sandbox behavior.  Now, when I run the permissive profile on my machine, I get:   precodesandbox-exec -f good_profile.sb /sbin/ping www.google.com PING www.google.com (216.58.194.196): 56 data bytes Request timeout for icmp_seq 0 Request timeout for icmp_seq 1 Request timeout for icmp_seq 2 Request timeout for icmp_seq 3 ^C --- www.google.com ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss /code/pre  But when I run the restricted profile I get:  precodesandbox-exec -f bad_profile.sb /sbin/ping www.google.com sandbox-exec: /sbin/ping: Operation not permitted /code/pre  In both cases, the profile was loaded, but in the second case the process was denied permissions needed to run and so never started.  <comment307936> Thanks @Testing! My alfred-profile.sb was indeed too restrictive.
