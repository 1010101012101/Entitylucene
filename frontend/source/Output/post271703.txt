How to remove dots that only become visible in the corners of the page when printing (Pages 5.6.2)? Picture included <body> I am editing a large text file in Pages (5.6.2). I use headers and footers. In the footers I have inserted page numbers in the middle bracket. The headers change with every chapter, the document is divided in sectios. Once I print the file, dots / full stops suddenly emerge at the four corners of the page. They are not visible in the document, even when I turn on 'Show Invisibles'. Do you have any idea on how to remove them? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/04Nf1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment341540> Do other apps add those as well? If yes it might be something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_steganography
