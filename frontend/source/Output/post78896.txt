Choosing hexadecimal web colours <body> How can I choose hexadecimal web colours (like #000000 and #fffff) to use in system and third party apps? em(e.g. an image editor like GraphicConverter)/em  <answer78899> Use Hex Color Picker:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TF5gG.png" alt="" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <answer141380> Skala Color is another solution, that works very well in the latest versions of Mac OSX.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7SN4E.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can select HEX to appear in place of the RGB code, which appears in the above picture.  I used Hex Color Picker for a long time but finally got tired of it trying to be smarter than me. Frequently I would type a single character and it filled in all 6 values for that same number; other times I would get through 2 characters and Hex Color Picker would repeat that. For whatever reason, I had to constantly copy/paste values into the picker, because it kept thinking it knew what I wanted (it didn't).  <answer228963> In newer versions of the stock OS X Colors utility: Select sliders from the toolbar and then "RGB Sliders" in the drop down - this will allow you to both read and enter RGB values hex:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnuOS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Not sure in which version of OS X this was introduced, but it's relatively newish.  <comment91191> Things I've tried which haven't worked: I've checked the manual and Google of course, and I've tried looking through the default Apple color picker which I could swear used to let you choose this (I'm now on OS X 10.7). <comment338107> this tool is abandoned now
