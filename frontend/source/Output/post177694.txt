How to display timecodes with iMovie 10.0.7 N <body> On discussion forums, I read that I have to go to iMovie Preferences and ask to display timecodes.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2129?locale=en_US&amp;viewlocale=fr_FR  But my preferences window only contains two checkboxes, none of them related to timecodes.  Do you know how to see the timecode for a given image in a movie ?  Thanks for your help !
