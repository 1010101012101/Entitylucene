How to see total memory usage per app? <body> Is there a way to see memory usage per app in macOS?  That is, I want to see the strongtotal/strong memory consumed by each app, including  its child processes.  The Activity Monitor shows memory usage by process which makes it hard to determine, for example, how much memory the Chrome app is using, since it spawns multiple processes.  <answer144343> Activity Monitor  View  All Processes, Hierarchically ought to do it, with a bit of scrolling...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfTi2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment170127> This seemed promising. But on checking I found that the it still doesn't show the *total* memory being used by an App. It's just individual processes grouped under the parent process. (You can verify that for the Safari and Mail apps shown in your screen shot -- the memory usage doesn't add up). In fact, on my Mac currently, the Chrome.app has child processes that individually seem to be using more memory than the parent Chrome.app process. <comment170128> Without knowing for certain, I'd say that you would need to add up all the child processes, then add the parent, to get the true total - I think you're assuming the parent IS the total. I would assume it's not. A simple test for that would be to check the kernel task total, which is nowhere near the sum of it's sub-processes. <comment170133> That's exactly what I said above... this view doesn't show the total memory usage per app. I am looking for a method that does. I can't be bothered to add 30 3-digit numbers each time I want to see how much memory chrome is using. <comment170136> Then I think you're out of luck - they are child processes, subordinate but separate to the main process. My fairly decent  Google-Fu finds no utility that will add them up automatically. Maybe someone else can find one... <comment170193> Or maybe create one ;) <comment188777> It's not that simple, processes can share memory, so total memory is not as easy as add all memory from the children. Plus, there's virtual versus real memory. It's a slightly complicated beast. :-( <comment227106> For Chrome specifically have you used its built in task manager? <comment252540> how do i find the activity monitor?? <comment252896> Applications/Utilities <comment330061> Would love to know this too. Trying to figure out how much RAM Chrome and it's child helpers are using.. no easy task it seems <comment334444> This doesn't work. Look at how `kernel_task` doesn't include the memory used by Xcode, so thus child processes of Xcode like the app `Prime Calc` I'm building with it aren't included in Xcode's memory count.
