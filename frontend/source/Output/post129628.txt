How do I perform a factory reset of my iPhone? <body> I am giving my iPhone to my daughter. How do I clear my information and set up hers? I want to make sure I do not lose any of my information from my accounts that I use on my current phone.  <answer129629> Doing emErase all Content and Settings/em from strongSettings / General / Reset/strong will do the trick.  This process will remove all settings and information from the device, letting you configure it from the very beginning, as if you had done a reinstall.  The process won't delete nor modify the iCloud's account data.  Bear in mind, then, that you should either have an iCloud or iTunes backup or be sure that every possible information emsynchronizable/em with iCloud is, indeed, synchronized. To do so you should go to strongSettings / iCloud/strong and check what's enabled and what's not.
