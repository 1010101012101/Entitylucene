How to get the PID of every window of every process? <body> I'm using the following simple script:  precodetell application "System Events" to get the title of every window of every process /code/pre  Which works by printing titles of every window (the same with position). Is there any similar way of printing process id (to which it belongs) of each window, using AppleScript?  <answer200926> You want codeunix id/code. Like this...  precodetell application "System Events" to get unix id of every process /code/pre  PS: Realize that not all "windows" returned by your original code are visible. So depending what you are trying to do you may want to also look into   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14551419/listing-all-windows-of-all-applications  Google will give you other examples...
