Which video/movie file format would be most convenient for inclusion into a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation? <body> I am a Windows user, and I have never used Keynote or PowerPoint on Mac. My colleague would like me to send him a video/movie file that he can incorporate into and play during a scientific presentation. He will use either Keynote or PowerPoint for Mac to create the presentation.   Which file format would be most convienent for inclusion into Keynote emand/or/em  PowerPoint for Mac presentations?  Some file formats that I can create on Windows include:  ul li*strong.avi/strong/li li*strong.mov/strong (QuickTime)/li li*strong.mpg/strong/li li*strong.mpeg/strong/li /ul  On Windows, I have found it very difficult to successfully include videos/movies in PowerPoint presentations; usually the slideshow ends up crashing or the video stalls. I am hoping that the Apple developers have this perfected in Keynote and PowerPoint for Mac.  <answer57026> I've tested AVI, MOV, and MP4 in Keynote and PowerPoint for Mac.  All three work fine in both applications.
