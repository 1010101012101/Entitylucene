Why does iPhone 6 have a thick line on its edge <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8Hwp.png" alt="This gap is whatI&#39;m talking about"  Apple never keeps even a dot on its hardware if it doesn't have a function. But why does the iPhone 6 have this Gap/Thick line on its edge? Any clue?  <answer195878> Those are for the phones antennae (theres one towards the bottom of the phone as well).  The anodised aluminium causes really bad signal attenuation, hence the plastic-like strips are necessary to create a break in the metal shell.  I decided to delve a bit further and found that Apple is trying to get rid of them.  <answer195893> The reason is an antennae for the phone, since having a smooth iPhone would cause horrible and impossible coverage(quite literally). Since the iPhone has a lot of bands to cover as many network as possible, the "split" the metal back, and many of the strips on the device caused by this are the antenna.  <comment233874> It's separating the parts of the external antenna. iPhone has WiFi/3G/LTE antennas and they need to be separated. <comment233950> @MateuszSzlosek: A bit like how comments and answers are ideally separated by this bit of white below: <comment234108> @MateuszSzlosek You meant it's just a line? if you did, Nope! I have already got the answer I needed. <comment234109> If Steve Jobs was around when they designed it, there wouldn't be a such a thing that spoils the whole beauty. Thanks for the answer man. <comment234110> Check iPhone4 for example, it also has antennas separators (but smaller ;) <comment234111> No I meant exactly what user3847746 has answered. But I couldn't find references co I wrota a comment. <comment234116> Yep the iPhone 4 does have them, slightly smaller and only a single one. This was what lead to the antennagate crisis of 2010 (signal loss would occur when the gap was bridged by a hand). iPhone 4s introduced dual antennae that could dynamically switch during calls which results in the two separators commonly seen today.
