Jailbreak my work phone <body> I just got an iPhone from my company. I have to access my work email on this iPhone 4.  However, I can't use Grooveshark as my music service, since it only works on jailbroken iPhones.  How can I jailbreak my phone so that company's server is unaffected? Or would it possibly even be affected in the first place?  How do I un-jailbrake the phone later, so I can return it to my company later unaltered?  <answer17419> Backup with iTunes to restore later, but just go to http://www.jailbreakme.com from you're iPhone, slide to unlock, and wait  <comment19008> Is the only thing your company did to the phone is configure the mail app? Are you actually dealing with iOS5? iOS5 hasn't been released yet. <comment19009> Sounds like a viable approach to me. Just be SURE to have your backup image/file from iTunes. You should backup the backup image/file. <comment19010> a) Will the company's server know that I am using jail break version. This is required since the updates has lot of policy information. b) Can I can go back to the original version without anyone knowing. I am not concerned about emails data. Just making sure they are secured. <comment19012> With my iPhone 3G I found installing iOS updates would simply ruin the jailbreak, but everything else would continue normally. I doubt they'd ever notice, but I guess never say never. <comment19013> They won't know unless you tell them or you get infected <comment72227> So did you do it? If so, how did it go?
