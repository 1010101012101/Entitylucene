Any way to have CPU temperature in the menu bar? <body> I tried SMC fan control and Temperature Monitor but it does not update the temperature and I do not wish to change the fan speed.   <answer169947> Temperature Monitor was last updated in 2009. So maybe it is not compatible with your OS.   I recently abandoned the fantastic MenuMeters (free) for iStat Menus 5, since the later provides even more info on practically all Mac sensors. Hardware Monitor and System Monitor are also capable of showing sensor information in the menu bar.   <answer169960> iStatMenu will give you what you need. And a whole lot more besides - all in a nice tightly integrated package that sits in your menu bar.  <comment199566> Could you expand on why SMCFanControl sucks? It's ben working well for me. <comment199568> it doesnt update the temp. it stays at the same level. also, i dont want to change fan speed <comment199573> Did you tried something like [iStat Menus 5](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)? <comment199594> smcFanControl should update the temperatures live, whether you use it to adjust the fan speed or not.
