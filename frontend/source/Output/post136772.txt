Wrong version of clang - how to update <body> I have XCode 5.1.1 installed, osx 11.9.4. I have no other versions of xcode on the machine. But somehow I have clang version 2.1! I need a more updated one and cannot figure out how to make the upgrade.  precodedelphi$ llvm-g++ --version i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-g++-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)  delphi$ clang++ --version Apple clang version 2.1 (tags/Apple/clang-163.7.1) (based on LLVM 3.0svn) Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0 /code/pre  if I do xcode-select --install I get the following:  precodedelphi$ xcode-select -install Usage: xcode-select -print-path    or: xcode-select -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;    or: xcode-select -version Arguments:    -print-path                     Prints the path of the current Xcode folder    -switch &lt;xcode_folder_path&gt;     Sets the path for the current Xcode folder    -version                        Prints xcode-select version information /code/pre  <answer136786> Possibly installing the latest command line tools will help? codexcode-select --install/code from terminal.  <comment162484> I added the output of running that command to the question. There was no space here. I was able to install the latest version of clang using macports, but still I don't understand what is happening here. <comment162485> Weird. Looks like your entire dev environment is old (`--install` wasn’t added that long ago). I guess you could try reinstalling xcode, but if you’ve got what you need through ports it’s probably not worth it. <comment162496> How did macports install it needs the latest Xcode command line tools to build - and not its own clang
