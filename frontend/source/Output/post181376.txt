automatically set alarm clock on iPhone if calendar event <body> Is there any way to automatically set the alarm clock on my iPhone if my calendar has an event in the morning?  The calendar events are being added from a variety of platforms via Google calendar, and I'd like there to automatically be an alarm on the phone (if the event is in the morning.)  Thanks  <answer181383> I believe that the alarm has to be activated on the event itself in your calendar app.  Just go to the event and edit it, then set a reminder alarm to go off at a specified time before the event (15 min. before, 1 hr. before, etc.).   Remember, you can set alarms when you're creating the event as well. =)  <answer181441> There is a app on iTunes that might do just what you want.

I updated my question to more accurately reflect my needs here. <comment215729> and this did not help https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242?hl=en ? <comment215739> To clarify (for me) it is not a repeating event! it is new event that get made by someone else and it shows up on your Google Calendar (and in your iCal).  It originally does not contains alarm or notification setting. As for morning? what specific time are you looking for (like before 9 AM or ?) <comment215742> this might work for you https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calarm-calendar-alarm-clock/id509840570?mt=8 <comment215807> @Buscar웃 you understood in your second comment, and appear to have provided an excellent answer in your third. <comment215808> So it works for you then :) let me make this a full answer for others to find the solution :) <comment215817> cheers to that! <comment279379> Have any of you tried the app?
