Share link for a photo from icloud or photos app <body> There used to be a way to get a direct link to a photo in iCloud and share it.   I was surprised to see this still isn't possible from the photos app so i went to the iCloud website and i still can't get a direct link to an image.   Is it possible to get a direct link to photo in iCloud that i can share with anyone?  <answer236013> You can create a public album and share the link to it to anyone, but not to a single image. One solution could be to create a album for each image.  iCloud: Create a shared album  You can also place the image file in iCloud drive, view the file in a browser and copy the link to it.
