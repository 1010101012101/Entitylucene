iPhone 4S on iOS 8 slow wake response <body> When the iPhone is charging, the response is quick. When it is not charging, sometimes the response lags. The lag is like this when not charging:  ol liPresses home/power button./li liDelays 1-2 seconds before waking up./li liAssisstiveTouch icon shows up first, followed by sudden display of lock screen./li /ol  The lag never happens when the iPhone is charging.  This has never happened on iOS 7.  So my question is, how do I fix this?  <comment178898> This is the same effect as iOS7 had on an iPhone 4. It shouldn't have been upgraded as the device is just a bit too slow for the newest version. <comment178900> Thank you for the comment, Rob. But why does this not happen during charging? <comment178901> I don't know the technical reason for that, but a laptop will also work faster when its's on a power outlet.. Something with charge and battery power. <comment178903> You might want to clarify your question. What are you looking for? A solution, or reasons for the problem? <comment178904> I guess you're right, my laptop does also speed up a little when it's charging. Might be the time to upgrade to iOS 8.1 and see if it fixes the problem like Apple addressed numerous bug fixes they have done. <comment178905> @mehmenmike  I have updated my question.
