Where can I find a user forum for the brand-new Apple iBooks Author application? <body> Apple has just released the free   h2iBooks Author/h2  application for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Where can I find some information about its capabilities. Yes, this is a "Jeopardy" question.  <answer37648> There is a new Apple Support Forum for iBooks Author  https://discussions.apple.com/community/mac_app_store/ibooks_author  <answer37703> This is not a direct answer to your question, but it does offer places to find information about its capabilities. I found this collection of links so useful, therefore I want to share it here:  h2Support Documents for iBooks Author/h2  ul liPublishing and distribution FAQ/li liUse iPad-safe fonts when authoring books/li liHow to make your iBooks accessible/li liBest practices for using 3D models/li liAbout the Keynote widget/li liAdd video to your iBooks/li /ul  <comment42739> I say you've found a darn good one right here where you're asking. <comment42740> Yes, but since iBooks Author was released just today, the Apple discussion forum was the first place to go to get impressions from several different people trying out the software.
