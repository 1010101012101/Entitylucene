When is the GUID partition table (GPT) preferred over Apple partition map (APM) for external drives? <body> I have seagate external portable hard-drive 1 TB, and I will be using with following Mac's.  13" White MacBook (Intel Core 2 Duo) running Snow Leopard 13" MacBook Air (Intel Core i5) running Lion iMac running Lion  What partition map I should use, GUID or Apple when formatting external portable hard-drive?  <answer49788> GUID (or more properly GPT - the GUID partition table scheme) is the new bootable standard for Macs so use it unless you have macs that need to boot from this drive and cannot support GUID. APM is your only option in that unlikely case. The vast majority of macs will work with both in all instances - especially if you don't need it to be bootable.  APM is not widely supported on other OS - so that may also tip the scales to using GUID in many instances.
