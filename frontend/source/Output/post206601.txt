How to review Apple Podcasts app? <body> Recent iPhone update also updated Podcasts app. Which is now missing lots of features and it is broken.br I found Apple Podcasts app in itunes but there is no Review tab or button. I like to write a review for apple but don't know how. How do i do that?    <answer206602> Podcasts is part of iOS, not on the App Store, therefore you can't review it on the App Store.  You can send feedback to Apple through Apple Feedback:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html/li /ul  <comment249032> IOS-9 is not in that page yet. So i can't use it yet.
