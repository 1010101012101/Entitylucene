Force Macbook Pro on AC mode using broken battery <body> I have a Macbook Pro 13" Retina (Early 2015) running 10.12.6 with a broken battery (Replace now alert) but I still couldn't find a proper battery in my region.    In this case I should shut down the device to move and it seems loosing power also resets the date and time and also breaks hibernate mode which I can use.    I'd like to know is there any solution for forcing AC Mode so it ignores battery (Performance issue due to changing between battery and ac somehow in runtime).   I also tried SMC and NVRAM reset but no chance either.    Please let me know if there should be more explanation.  <answer296306> I noticed the performance issue is because of the battery issue. When battery is not recognized by the OS codeX86PlatformPlugin/code (Can be seen in disas, but need confirmation) uses codeCPUFloor/code of your device model plist in code/S/L/E/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/X86PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources//code.  The issue was battery does not recognized on boot and for MBP 2015 13" codeCPUFloor==800/code which is too low.   BTW thanks to codePikerAlpha/code you can use codefreqVectorEdit.sh/code to change your PowerManager plist. I also changed codeCPUFloor/code to higher number so MBP can be used smoothly again.
