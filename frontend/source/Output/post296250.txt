Finder Favorites Sorting resets to default <body> Every time i restart my computer (macbook pro 2017 touch bar, sierra 10.12.6), the Finder's favorites resets the custom sorting. I want the Desktop icon to be first.  I already deleted both finder and sidebarlists files, but didn't work:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.sidebarlists.plist /code/pre  I've created a new user on my laptop and there the reordering stays put after the killall Finder / reset test (see below).  Any ideas?  Steps:  ul liOpen a Finder Window/li liOn the Favorites list (left), move the Desktop icon to the top/li liRun the "killall Finder" on the Terminal/li liOpen a Finder Window/li liDesktop icon is back to default/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UskCY.png" alt="enter image description here"
