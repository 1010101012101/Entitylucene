OS X Preview adding box comments around text in PDFs <body> When I open PDF's (seems to be ones generated from AutoCAD) preview adds rectangles around every text object.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6F3K.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can remove these in preview (command-I, select all and delete) but this is a pain when you forget and then forward one of these PDFs etc.  Anyone seen this before and perhaps know why this happens?  I suspect it's a PDF creation issue from AutoCAD but asking here because this does not show up on the PC side of the office.
