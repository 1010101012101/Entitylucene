How can I add an HFS+ partition to an MBR-partitioned external drive <body> I have a 1Tb external drive that currently has two partitions -   ul li64 Gb NTFS/li li524 Gb ext2/li /ul  The remaining 414Gb is unused and shows as "Free Space" on the Mac's Disk Utility.   I'd like to take 250Gb of this for an HFS+ partition to use with Time Machine, but Disk Utility doesn't seem to offer a way to add a partition in that space or format it.  My running Linux box (FC9) doesn't offer an hfs+ option for mkfs; if needed, I could boot from a DVD of a more modern Linux distro to accomplish this.  This question is similar, but my partition table is fdisk format, not guid.   I'm running MacOS 10.7.5.  Here is information on the current partitions  precode# diskutil list disk1 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:             Windows_FAT_32 NO NAME                 61.4 GB    disk1s1    2:                      Linux                         524.3 GB   disk1s2  # gpt -r show disk1        start        size  index  contents            0           1         MBR            1   120005549      1  MBR part 12    120005550  1023999165      2  MBR part 131   1144004715   809520453         # fdisk /dev/disk1 Disk: /dev/disk1    geometry: 121601/255/63 [1953525168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: 0C    0   0   2 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -  120005549] Win95 FAT32L  2: 83 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 120005550 - 1023999165] Linux files*  3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused      /code/pre  <answer107151> strongObligatory warning:/strong You seem to have found your way to codefdisk/code. Keep in mind that its editing features have no real safeguards against accidentally using codeerase/code (which removes emall/em the partitions) or editing a partition that Mac OS X is currently using, and also few safeguards against even entering numbers that don't make any sense, so emplease be careful/em.  You can use codefdisk/code in interactive mode to edit the entries in the partition table:  precodesudo fdisk -e /dev/rdisk1 /code/pre  Then edit your first blank partition table entry (e.g. codeedit 3/code), set it to type codeAF/code, press return for the default to the codeCHS mode/code question, press return to accept the default of starting the partition after the end of the last one, then enter the end sector number you want (the default is the end of the disk; to figure out one for a size you want: divide the size you want by 512 bytes to get the number of sectors you want, and then add that to the start sector number and subtract one to get the end sector number ). Do a codeprint/code to make sure it looks okay (nothing has been saved yet, so if there's a mistake you can just codeexit/code strong(not codequit/code)/strong at this point and run codefdisk/code again to start from the beginning.) Then codewrite/code to save the partition table over the old one on the disk. Then codeexit/code.  If you get a warning at codewrite/code that the changes will require a reboot, that's okay; answer codey/code, and reboot Mac OS X after codeexit/codeing.  Now the partition table has been updated, but the partition itself still has the old contents; Run Disk Utility, and from the Erase tab, choose the new partition, give it a name, and Erase it.   <comment91818> Bad Karma... after posting the question, this became a lot more urgent.  Disk Utility is now reporting my HDD is failing.  I've just ordered a  replacement drive...
