Accidentally removed pbcopy <body> I messed up pbcopy. Instead of  precode cat foo | pbcopy /code/pre  I did  precode  cat foo &gt; pbcopy /code/pre  And now my pbcopy is a text file. How can I reinstall it? Is it a part of some specific package, maybe something in homebrew?  <answer115770> Unless you ran these commands in the directory code/usr/bin/code, and with root privileges, you have not overwritten the real pbcopy - you've simply created a new file in your current working directory with the same name.  So - you most likely do not have to reinstall pbcopy. To verify, you can call the full program explicitly, like this:  precodecat foo | /usr/bin/pbcopy /code/pre  which should work properly. If it does, you can delete the pbcopy you inadvertently created safely...  <answer115775> The codepbcopy/code binary comes from the OS X base installation and you can restore it from Time Machine (either a local snapshot or an external drive) will have copies of that file.  Next, you could open the installer in a program like Pacifist and extract that binary.  Worst case, rerun the installer or get a copy of the binary from a trusted source and you should be good to go as long as the source is the same level as your OS.  <comment135454> Unfortunatelly, I was root at that time... <comment135462> @Adrian Ouch. Next time you are heading into root, you can issue `tmutil snapshot` to set a local snapshot of files if you have a local Time Machine destination. It won't help you now unless you already have a backup, but it's nice to have a rollback safety net when you are root. <comment135468> What OS do you have? I could just put mine up on Dropbox. I do run 10.8.5 and 10.7.4 so not the latest OS version though. Oh, you really where in /usr/bin directory at the time running that command? <comment135476> â†’ Adrian: if you were `root` but not within the `/usr/bin` directory, the analysis of Scot stands. I advise you to check it.
