Can I use USB headset with iPhone 7? <body> I have a USB headset. It works just fine on a PC or a Macbook without any install.  If I connect it to an Android phone with micro-USB port, via some micro-USB to full-size USB adapter, it doesn't work. It can even restart the whole phone.  For iPhone 7 with the Lightning port, is it possible to connect a USB headset to it via some Lightning-to-USB adapter?  <answer252527> You may be able to connect a USB headset to an iPhone 7, but it will not work until the required USB drivers and the ability to install them are available, which will probably not happen.  <answer261428> If your USB headset uses a split between USB power and an auxiliary line for the audio input you can use a battery pack to power the headset with the USB cable and use the dongle that comes with the iPhone 7 to connect the audio output from your iPhone 7 to your headset. Otherwise if you rely on getting audio transmission through USB data you will be out of luck unless somebody makes an external driver dongle for the iPhone.
