iMac Connectivity Issues <body> I recently got an iMac, and it's been great so far besides one problem. For some reason, after X amount of minutes(sometimes an hour, sometimes 10 minutes), I randomly lose connectivity on it. Like I am still connected to my router, but it won't load any webpages or anything. My only solution to fix it is then turning off wifi, and then turning it back on. The reason I do this is so it renews my DHCP, and it is faster than going to Network - Advanced, etc...  No other computers do this on my network, so I really don't know what the problem is. I've tried assigning it a manual IP, still does nothing. I've Googled everywhere, unfortunately, many people have this problem but there is no direct answer on how to fix this.  It is a brand new iMac, 8GB RAM, Intel Core i5 Processor, running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 with a 21.5 inch screen.  I have not tried contacting Apple support yet, as it is late. How are they?  Please help if you've had this problem or know how to fix it. Thanks   <comment53651> Not enough info here for us to do any diagnosis. Your best bet is to bring your machine into Apple Support - they'll be able to take a look at the logs and run some diagnostics. <comment53715> There is a firmware update for certain iMacs that resolves this issue. Have you run `Software Update`? <comment53830> Yes, unfortunately I did. I also downloaded some package that fix other bugs, but was not released in the Software Update. I got it from Apple's website, but it still didn't help.
