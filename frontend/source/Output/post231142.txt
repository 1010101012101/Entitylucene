How to get an applescript to play a song file <body> Okay so I want an applescript app that plays a song. The song isn't already on the computer and it's contained inside contents/resources of the app's package contents. This is my current code  precodetell application "Finder"     set apppath to POSIX path of (application file id "com.apple.ScriptEditor.id.play" as text) end tell set song to {apppath, "/Contents/Resources/song.mp3"} as string set songpath to POSIX file song as text tell application "QuickTime Player"     activate     open songpath     play the front document     tell application "System Events"         set visible of application process "QuickTime Player" to false     end tell end tell /code/pre  On my computer this code seems to work. However when distributing it, other computers get an error in quicktime. The document “song.mp3” could not be opened. The file doesn’t exist. Any help?  Edit: Fixed an incorrect variable which doesn't fix the problem because I changed the code to post it here and mixed it up.  <answer231552> Activating QuickTime is a lot of overhead for playing a single file.  You can use codeafplay/code instead:  precodedo shell script "afplay " &amp; songpath  /code/pre  <comment282243> Where does QSpath come from? <comment282756> It would seem i have put the wrong variable in... anyway thanks for notifying me <comment282760> Works like a charm. The only problem now would be controlling the audio. However that doesn't seem like something google can't help me with. <comment282764> Try `afplay -h` in terminal to see the possible options
