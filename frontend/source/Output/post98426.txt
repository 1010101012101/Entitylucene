SSH remote using XQuartz dosent work in Lion <body> I was using previous version of Mac and used to connected to a server with SSH console.It used to run X 11 after loading my requested programs(Mathematica) on remote server and was working properly.Recently I upgraded my Mac to the latest version(Mountain Lion 10.8.4) and this SSH is not loading the "X" and I can not use remote access to my requested program from remote server.How can I fix the problem.Please in a easy way because I am not in using Mac commands at all.  Thanks  <answer98438> As per this page, X11/XQuartz is deprecated from OS X now, and you will need to install it seperately in order to get any X-Windows display manager type stuff working:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5293  There seems to be another X11 download here which may also be useful.  http://support.apple.com/downloads/X11_for_Mac_OS_X_1_0  <comment115523> Do you mean X11, the display manager?  if so, it was deprecated, and you will need to download and install it seperately as it is no longer included in OS X. <comment115540> @stuffe hi many thanks I installed X11 but this time the Java jives Authentication error after I want to run my required module in SSH console.What could be wrong? <comment115546> Not sure, it might be worth asking a fresh question for this - I will add my comment as an answer, because it was just a quess before. <comment115555> → Alex: please edit your original post. As noted by Stuffe, `X 10` doesn't mean a lot to many of us (except the survivors who knew this version of the X Window System ☺).
