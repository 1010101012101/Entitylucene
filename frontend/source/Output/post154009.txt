How do I replace a symlink with the actual file? <body> I want to remove the symlink and instead insert the file it links to, if possible all with one command so I can have it as an "External Tool" in phpStorm.  <answer154011> precodecp --remove-destination "$(readlink &lt;symlink&gt;)" &lt;symlink&gt; /code/pre  supSource: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/35027/sup  <comment181469> Thanks I tried this and it didn't work but it turns out that it was because the links where copied and didn't point to the right place anymore. But I was confused and thought it was something with bash <comment337983> How do I get this to work for all symlinks in a directory?  Find complains about `illegal option -t` whenever I put it in a loop. <comment337984> @cjm This should work fine with find. Are you missing the path as an argument to find? What's your exact find command? <comment337985> @grgarside I was missing the path as my find argument.  Now my problem is that cp is getting whiny about `illegal option -- -` instead of recognizing `--remove-destination` as a valid option.  Command is `for f in (find . -type l); cp --remove-destination "(readlink $f)" $f;end;`; shell is fish.  It complains about the illegal option whether or not the `(readlink $f)` is quoted or not. <comment337987> @cjm You're missing a ‘$’ before the open bracket before readlink (should be `"$(readlink`). Also why are you using the shell to do the loop? `find . -type l -exec cp --remove-destination "$(readlink {})" {} \;` <comment337990> I was using the shell for looping based off [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26298571/5544691).  It seems that `--remove-destination` doesn't work in Mac OS, since everything I try ends with `cp: illegal option -- -`
