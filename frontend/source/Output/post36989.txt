I have intrepreted that you have Google cal synced with iCal, but want to sync iCal with Outlook.  You can sync iCal with Outlook. The full instructions are on microsofts Outlook for mac support page  <answer162729> The sync page referred to in the above answer had been removed from the Microsoft page.  All of the references on the MS page say that since os x doesn't support CalDAV you can't sync your mac cal with outlook 2011.  Drives everyone go Google if your a gmail user.    <comment143248> Prior to OS X 10.9, you can sync Outlook for Mac and iCal/Calendar using Sync Services. As of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, Sync Services is no longer available and this approach will not work any longer.
