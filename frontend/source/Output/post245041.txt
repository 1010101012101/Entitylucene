netsh equivalent in OSX <body> In Windows, I enjoy the ability to toggle the "LAN" NIC between a known static IP and DHCP from the command line interface (CLI) via .bat files:  precodenetsh interface ip set address name="LAN" static 192.168.1.88 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.20 1    netsh interface ip set address "LAN" dhcp /code/pre  What would be the OSX CLI equivalent?   When configuring network devices, I find myself frequently toggling between DHCP &lt;== Static IP configurations on the CLI.    There seem to be plenty of examples of performing this task via the GUI, however, this does not lend itself to frequent toggling between DHCP and a target static IP.  The ability to toggle between states from the CLI is convenient.  It may be the pinnacle-of-convenience to invoke a toggle-script to a Safari \ Firefox button.    <answer245055> A codenetsh/code counterpart for manipulating network settings would be the codenetworksetup/code command, but to achieve what you want, the easiest would be to define two separate network locations in GUI, one with static IP, the other one with DHCP. Then execute:  precode# scselect Defined sets include: (* == current set)    02080D27-B377-4942-BB3A-CF0C8F049F9E (static IP)  * 0F27B96E-9B5A-4FAE-B639-C374BD77C1A6 (DHCP) /code/pre  Take note of the GUID and execute the following to switch:  precode# scselect 02080D27-B377-4942-BB3A-CF0C8F049F9E /code/pre  You can write a more friendly script with codegrep/code and codesed/code to suit your taste.
