Having trouble installing Dropbox on iPad <body> I personally have never used an iPad.  I invited a friend to a shared folder on Dropbox, and tried to help her install Dropbox on her iPad.  It said there was not enough memory.  But it only listed two things as taking up space, and the numbers were ridiculously small -- e.g. 76 KB for email.  In your step-by-step instructions, please don't assume my friend or I know emanything./em  Thank you!!!  I am in Manage Storage.  It says: Last backup failed An additional 3.7 GB of storage is required.  etc.  Below that, it says Backups this ipad: 0 KB  Documents &amp; Data Pages 74.2 KB  Mail 29 KB  <comment249037> At what stage did it say not enough memory? and where did it list only two things- The memory listing in settings shows all apps <comment249144> Can you go to Settings - General - Usage and tell us how much free disk space is there? Have you tried updating to iOS 9? <comment249159> That I can answer from memory.  Zero available.  Updating -- no.  That would be too ambitious for me.  But actually, I don't know what operating system version the iPad is running.
