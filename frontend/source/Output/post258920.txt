XQuartz: xterm command slow since last update <body> I often use the following command to get a new terminal on XQuartz.  precodexterm -sh 1.01 -u8 -fa 12 -fg LightBlue -bg black &amp; /code/pre  However, since the last update of XQuartz, it takes about 1 min for the new terminal to open, whereas a simple xterm command without any options is immediate.  Could someone help me out with this?  <answer259096> The last update of XQuartz ( 2.7.11_rc2 (xorg-server 1.18.4) ) seems to have corrected the problem.
