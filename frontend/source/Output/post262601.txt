How to lock a MacBook Pro (Touch Bar version) with a short cut key? <body> I used to lock my MacBook Air by Shitt-Control-Eject shortcut key. After replacing the Air with a Touch Bar MacBook Pro, there is no Eject key anymore.   How can I lock it with a shortcut key?  <answer262621> Use codeShift+Ctrl+Power/code shortcut.  <comment333907> It doesn't work on the new Macbook Pro with Touchbar late 2016 anymore.
