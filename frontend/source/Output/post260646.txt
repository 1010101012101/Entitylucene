How do i disable messenger on the iMac but not my MacBook/iPhone. <body> I have an iPhone and MacBook that are my own and an iMac that I share with my fianc√©. I have it set up currently so that my txt messages come to my phone, and both computers. As this can be annoying when she is using the home computer and I am not (getting my random txts), how do i disable messenger on the iMac but not my MacBook/iPhone.   <answer260719> Assuming you mean the Messages app, all you need to do is sign out of it on the iMac.  To do this:  ol liLaunch the Messages app on the iMac/li liGo to Messages menu  Preferences/li liSelect the Accounts icon/li liClick on your account (in the left-hand column)/li liClick on the Sign Out button (on the right-hand side)/li /ol  When you exit the Messages app it will no longer receive your messages.
