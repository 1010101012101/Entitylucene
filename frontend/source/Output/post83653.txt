How to reenable Java Preferences <body> After installed JDK7, I disabled Java 1.6 in Java Preferences. Then I found the system cannot launch jars by new JDK 1.7, so I want to reenable 1.6, but I cannot relaunch preference again, it told me codeNo compatible version of Java 1.5+ is available./code  What should I do to bring it back?  <answer84227> This is a partial answer and will need adding to, mainly to show the change in Info.plist and an official reference for it.  It seems (from this blog) that the structure or the Info.plist in running packaged Java apps has changed. The blog says in Mountain Lion but I would have the same issue in Lion, the issue is the change in Java.   Thus I can see two ways of running pakaged apps  ol liInstall java 1.6 from Apple (running Mongo.app uses this one for me)/li liRepackage the app using the suggested AppBundler/li /ol  <comment96312> What does `java -version` show in Terminal? <comment96527> @Mark java version "1.7.0_15" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_15-b03) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode) <comment96543> What does the Java control panel in System Preferences and what exactly do you mean by " system cannot launch jars" <comment96880> @Mark When I launch Java applications like umongo, it appears 'No compatible version of Java 1.6+ is available.' <comment96887> Is the issue just packaged java .apps or running jars from the command line  as well? <comment108337> Please, do you have a link for Mongo.app? And do you suggest repackaging Apple's outdated JavaÂ Preferences.app? <comment108338> Do you mean [UMongo](http://edgytech.com/umongo/)? <comment108342> @GrahamPerrin - a misunderstanding I could not find umongo as in the OP's question but could find Mongo.app - now it is the other way round. Mountain Lion says Umongo.app is damaged and won't run. The answer is the same I think as Mongo.app was a packaged Java app
