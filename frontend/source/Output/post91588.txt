What's the touch resolution (LPI) of the Magic Trackpad? <body> I'd like to know how the Magic Trackpad compares with Wacom tablets as far as resolution goes.  The Wacom Intuos5 line has 5080 LPI, while the Bamboo line has 2540.  <comment107833> I'd assume the Magic Trackpad would have a much lower resolution than the tablets you mentioned.  The Magic trackpad is designed to be used similarly to the trackpad on a macbook; used for web browsing, etc, and not for very fine drawing work like the Wacoms.
