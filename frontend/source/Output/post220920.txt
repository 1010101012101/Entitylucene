I erased the partition where Windows 10 was previously installed. How can I merge it with my OS X partition? <body> So I started up Disk Utility and erased my BOOTCAMP partition and set the format to codeOS X Extended (Journaled)/code.  This is how my partitions look like now: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VY4tx.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see, I have a BOOTCAMP partition (129 GB), my mac partition (362 GB) and I have 8 GB of unused space. How can I merge all of this with my mac partition? I heard that I should be able to click "-" when BOOTCAMP is selected and then expand my mac partition to use the unused space, but as you can see, I can not click the "-" button. My mac partition is "Journaled, Encrypted" by the way.  emdiskutil list/em output: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/btoJO.png" alt="enter image description here"  emdiskutil cs list/em output: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLNTZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer220927> You can't simply merge a Bootcamp partition or empty space and a FileVault volume with Disk Utility (Boot Camp Assistant should handle this though). You first have to remove the Bootcamp partition and then expand the FileVault volume.  To remove the Bootcamp partition and resize the CoreStorage Volume Group (containing the FileVault volume) the Mac has to be booted to Internet Recovery Mode. Recovery Mode is not sufficient because the Recovery HD has to be moved. The actual boot volume or partition can't be moved.  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan)./li /ul  strongRemove bootcamp partition and expand CoreStorage Volume Group/strong  ul liBooted to Internet Recovery Mode open Utilities → Terminal in the menubar and enter:  codediskutil list/code to get the disk identifiers and codediskutil cs list/code to get a CoreStorage listing.

I'm just unsure how to see of filevault is unlocked/mounted from diskutil list. <comment267471> I can't get it to boot to Internet Recovery Mode. I've been trying for over an hour now. I selected a wifi (don't have ethernet) but it seems like it's too slow (took over 40 minutes to fill the loading bar to around 90%) and then it got stuck. I tried to restart so that I could try with different wifi but it seems like it now always selects the first wifi as default. I can't change to a different wifi in Internet Recovery Mode. Do you think there's anything else I could try? Or what could I do to force it to change wifi? <comment267480> Yes! It took me longer than I care to admit, but I did it. And I couldn't have done it without your great instructions. Thank you very, very much!  I only have one more question. If I decided to boot camp again...what can I do in the future to avoid this problem? As far as I know, the boot camp assistant should be able to merge the partitions back for me. Why wasn't it able to do so this time? <comment267481> @Whiz ;-) You have to delete/remove the Bootcamp partition with the Boot Camp Assistant.
