Use function keys on 2016 MBP when Fn key is set to expand control strip <body> Since I use the control strip more often than the traditional function keys, I set the "Press Fn key to" setting to "Expand Control Strip" on my 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. This option can be found under System Preferences  Keyboard.  However, there are a few rare occasions in which I still need to use the function keys. Is there an alternative way to use/display them, or does this setting completely remove them? It would be a pain to change the settings every time I need to use a function key.  Tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cxwkC.png" alt="System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Press Fn key to"
