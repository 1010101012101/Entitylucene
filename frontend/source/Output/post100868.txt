An iOS application update wiped its previous data, is there any way to recover it? <body> I updated an application today on my iPhone 5, and it wiped out its previous version's stored data.  Problem is, that previous stored data included authentication information I need for some websites.  Is there any way to "roll back" or recover the application data from the previous version of the application?
