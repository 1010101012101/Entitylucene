Uninstalling JAMBOX by Jawbone <body> I've uninstalled the Jawbone Updater software by deleting it from code/Applications/code. However, I'm still seeing the JAMBOX by Jawbone as a Bluetooth output and input in the System Preferences panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhxpg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried to delete these using the command:  precode$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/jawbone.kext /code/pre  But received the error message:  precode(kernel) Kext com.aliph.driver.jstub not found for unload request. Failed to unload com.aliph.driver.jstub - (libkern/kext) not found. /code/pre  How can I delete these Bluetooth inputs and outputs?  <answer104230> Delete the JAMBOX from the Bluetooth Prefs Pane in System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ui0a0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment122793> No. I hadn't. Deleting the JAMBOX from the Bluetooth system preferences pane also removed JAMBOX from the Sound preferences pane. Thanks.
