El Capitan WiFi Connection Drops Continuously <body> I have MBP Late 2013 and El Capitan 10.11.4 installed. But i have got a serious WiFi Connection dropping problem for a while. It is quite irritating as you may guess.  I couldn't find any clue why this is happening. None of my other devices experience the same problem, only MacBook Pro.  Here is the console logs http://pastebin.com/fY3J5PUW  Thanks in advance  <answer248226> This fixed it for me:  ol liSystem Preferences – Energy Saver – Battery Power : Uncheck “wake for network access”/li liSystem Preferences – Network – Advance – TCP/IP : Configure IPv6 – Switch to “Link-Local only”/li /ol  Found that above fix in the comments of this article http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/16/fix-wi-fi-problems-mac-os-x-el-capitan/  <comment307540> Actually setting wifi connection protocol to a fixed value (for example 802.11n) was helped me. <comment307628> @bahadirarslan Glad to hear you got it working. Where can I set the  wifi connection protocol? <comment307630> i configured it at router settings. <comment307658> Ahh, was thinking it wasn't a mac setting!.Will try that if I have any issues in the future.
