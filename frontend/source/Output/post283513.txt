How can I prevent my macbook from dismountng DMG images on hibernate? <body> I routinely mount and work from encrypted DMG images where I store important files.  These appear as mounted drives Finder.  When my macbook runs out of battery completely, it hibernates to disk.  When I wake it up from hibernation, it has unmounted the image files and abandoned anything I was working on.    How can I prevent this?  I have not found any relevant settings in pmset.
