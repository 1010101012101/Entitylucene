El Capitan's Spotlight internet features are not working. e.g. it's not showing weather for my location <body> I have already restarted Mac 5 times and it did not work. My Mac is connected to the internet as I am posting this over the internet. I updated my Mac today and now it's running El Capitan 10.11.5  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N8Mwo.png" alt=""  The first thing I did is to look at the Spotlight feature of El Captian "Weather Search from spotlight" but it did not work (to much disappointment).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JnKuc.png" alt=""  I have checked the Spotlight preferences and everything there is checked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3XYf3.png" alt=""  <answer240572> As this Apple Support page states, Spotlight suggestions doesn't seem to be available in your region.    emIt's pretty surprising since you are using it en English, but I already had the same experience (OS X is in French, but those features aren't available since I am not in the French mainland)./em  <comment295726> Thanks for replying @trevior but I will be waiting for a workaround. However, +10 for the nice information. <comment295727> You are welcome! From what I saw, connecting from an IP located in supported countries seems to work, but that's not a really good solution. (And than you for the vote)
