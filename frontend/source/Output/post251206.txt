Loop multiple videos <body> What is the best way to loop a number of videos, that are already on an iPad?   Either an app or a built in solution. The slideshow feature of the built in Photos app does not really work - it crops the video, and adds a gray border.  I have tried a number of apps for this purpose, none of which actually seem to do the job very well or at all.  <answer251211> Turns out the VLC app was the only decent solution I could find.
