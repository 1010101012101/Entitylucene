Apple Watch face blank <body> I mistakenly unpaired my Apple Watch from my iPhone. Now the voice over on my watch is on, screen curtain is on, but my screen is blank. I don't know which button to press and I have been trying to pair it back. Since my screen is blank, how do I do this?  <answer233464> Try restarting it by holding down the Digital Crown and side button together until you see the Apple logo appear.
