How to mount cd in single user mode? <body> I don't see it listed under /dev. dmesg doesn't help. Apple diagnostics is missing from my computer and I believe there may be an issue with the hard drive so I was hoping to restore it from the install cd as per instructions elsewhere on the web.  I believe late 2007 iMac running 10.8.5  Just to be clear the iMac won't start up, not even in safe mode hence the single user mode reliance.  <comment220983> is there a 'single user mode' tag? <comment221024> there is - added <comment221025> Which iMac is it? Most machines will use AHT from the net if it can't be found on the machine itself - see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257 <comment221035> @Tetsujin if it shipped with OS X installation CD, that would be Snow Leopard - meaning that the firmware of the OP's machine doesnâ€™t support networked AHT (with few exceptions). Nonetheless, more info is necessary and the tech specs would be useful. <comment221037> Thanks @njboot - I wasn't sure when the transition occurred. <comment221108> This iMac shipped with 10.6. <comment221115> oops, its apple diagnostics I'm looking for. But all the same you're supposed to hold the 'D' key on start up for both programs, so its not like I just did the wrong thing.
