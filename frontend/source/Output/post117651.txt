Restore User License From Time Machine Backup <body> I bought a used mack book.  The nice thing was it came with the complete Adobe Suite 5.  But apple reformatted the disk to fix a problem.  When I did time machine the Adobe license number came up, but it said it was invalid.   I contacted Adobe and they said the license was registered to another user.  I guess that's the previous owner.  Is there anyway I can get time machine to restore it so the apps work?  Thx.  <answer117662> From the CS5 US License document:     YOU WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN OR   TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS IN THE SOFTWARE, OR AUTHORIZE ANY PORTION OF THE   SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITYâ€™S   COMPUTER EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN. You may,   however, permanently transfer all your rights to use the Software to   another individual or legal entity provided that: (a) you also   transfer (i) this agreement, (ii) the serial number(s), the Software   affixed to media provided by Adobe or its authorized distributor, and   all other software or hardware bundled, packaged or pre-installed with   the Software, including all copies, upgrades, updates, and prior   versions, and (iii) all copies of font software converted into other   formats to such individual or entity; (b) you retain no upgrades,   updates or copies, including backups and copies stored on a Computer;   and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this   agreement and any other terms and conditions under which you purchased   a valid license to the Software.   If the license code does not work, you're out of luck unless you can get the license code from the previous owner and the media (CD or DVD installer discs.)  <comment137425> Did you want to retrieve the previous owners credit card numbers also? I seriously doubt what you're wanting to do is ethical, or legal. If you want the serial numbers and the license is able to be transferred then you should contact the previous owner.
