Disable ⌘Q for a specific application <body> I know someone or the other has asked about disabling ⌘Q, but I like the shortcut, and I use it often. However, I use an email client called Airmail that unfortunately does not keep a service (for notifications) running in the background when it is quitted. However, if I press the close button a service runs in the background, allowing me to receive notifications.  But since I have a habit of pressing ⌘Q all the time to close apps, I was looking into a way I could disable it for emonly Airmail./em  Anyone know of a what to do this?  <answer175090> You can add a Key Command to any app [or all apps] frombr System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcutsbr I don't have Airmail, but using Safari as an example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hlh9h.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hit the + button, select which app, type the menu name &amp; your chosen key combobr For an app you don't want the original key combo to work for, replace it with something difficult to hit, or something you would never use, likebr kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd / kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd  / kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd / kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd / kbd F15 /kbd  etc  Alternatively, if you want to replace Quit with Close Window, you add kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Q /kbd  to Close Window instead, [so long as that command appears in the menu somewhere] which will automatically strongremove/strong kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Q /kbd from the Quit item  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bwOti.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment206275> You can do it in system prefs, keyboard- add a new, different, command to it, one you won't hit accidentally- or even assign cmd q to close window. On phone so will flesh out later <comment206289> I only want it to be disabled on airmail. <comment206300> As stated before, you can try System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts.  There you can define whether the shortcut is valid for ONE application or all applications. <comment206425> Big Problem: Airmail does not have Close Window or anything similar in the menu bar. It only has Quit Airmail. The only way to close windows is to press the close button. <comment206426> Then you'd have to go with my first option, assign Quit something you'll never hit accidentally. <comment206427> Its not that I hit cmdQ accidentaly. I'm just used to it. If I replace it with something else, I will just get used to it again. <comment206428> The idea isn't to use the new combo, it's to stop you using it. I can't help if you are simply going to learn the new one & use that instead.
