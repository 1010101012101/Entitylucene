Can Mainstage send multiple CC messages on channel X based on a program change on channel Y <body> I have a GCX guitar switcher that opens and closes switches based on MIDI CC messages.  For a given preset, I would like to send up to 8 CC# messages on channel 16. (Channel 16 is the only channel a GCX will listen to.)  So effectively, when I send a program change on Channel 1, I would like MainStage to send a few different CC# on 16.  I was able to tie a CC# input on a MIDI channel to a CC# send variable on another channel, but it doesn't seem to let me assign the one CC# input control to multiple CC# outputs controls. Further more, this is tying a CC# input to an alternate CC# output, not a program change input to multiple CC# outputs.   I'm using MainStage 3.2.4 and OS X 10.12.2
