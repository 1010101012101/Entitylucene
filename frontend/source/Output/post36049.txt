Remove useless files from a Mac <body> I want to find a way to delete all the useless files: binaries, log and cache files, duplicate files and app's leftover.   How can I do that?  <answer36050> I use CleanMyMac, which has the following features:  ul lireset outdated cache files to zero/li liremove log files/li liremove the binary files that are not executed on your computer, from applications with an executable for PowerPC and Intel/li liremove useless files created by applications/li liremove leftovers, and clean the trashcan/li likeep the trashcan under control, and delete the files when the size of the files contained in the trashcan reach a limit you can set/li liuninstall applications  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oso9t.png" alt="screenshot"/li /ul  <answer36064> h1Onyx (free)/h1  ul liVerify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files, to run misc. tasks of system maintenance/li liConfigure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, QuickTime, Safari, Mail, iTunes, Login window, Spotlight, and many of Appleâ€™s applications/li liDelete caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become cumbersome, and more./li li.../li /ul  Removing duplicate files is not supported by Onyx.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6X8We.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer36316> I use Macaroni by Atomic Bird http://www.atomicbird.com.  Cost $10.  Installs as a login item, with a pane in System Preferences.  Automatic daily, weekly and monthly cleaning.  2014: I would also recommend "Duplicate Detective", currently $3 in the Mac App Store.  It finds files with duplicate hash values, not relying on file names or just file sizes alone.    <answer123818> One of the oldest and popular app is CCleaner. It is most popular app for PC. And it works perfectly on Mac too.  ul lihttps://www.piriform.com/mac/ccleaner/li /ul  <comment41112> Not sure why you were voted down. I use an application called MacKeeper which is quite similar. <comment41128> I'd also like an explanation for the downvote. <comment41131> Having used both CleanMyMac and MacKeeper, I have to say they are both dubious applications. They run constantly, and are *extremely* hard to remove. <comment41142> I downvoted for 3 reasons. One was touched on by @spudwaffle: the product is not entirely safe. The second is because the guys that run MacPaw (makers of CleanMyMac) exploit the review system of sites like MacUpdate to artificially inflate their rankings (by giving out licenses in exchange for favorable reviews). Therefore, it's not a product I feel deserves any support (and when I hear something favorable about the app, I'm always wary that it's disingenuous). Lastly, the answer is really just a glorified promo for the app and doesn't address the full scope of the question. <comment41228> @cksum The OP didn't ask for a free application, and I am not affiliated with who developers the application. <comment144631> I have found CleanMyMac 2 to be very easy to use and worth the price.
