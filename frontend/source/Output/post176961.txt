How can I work around Subversion's port being blocked when installing something with brew? <body> I'm running into an issue where I'm trying to follow the advice of a comment on this SO Q&amp;A titled: Use PPK file in Mac Terminal to connect to remote connection over SSH that suggested you could install putty via an Subversion repository like so:  precode$ brew install putty --HEAD /code/pre  When attempted I get this error:  precode$ brew install putty --HEAD ==&gt; Cloning svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty svn: E000060: Unable to connect to a repository at URL 'svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty' svn: E000060: Can't connect to host 'svn.tartarus.org': Operation timed out Error: Failed to download resource "putty" Failure while executing: svn checkout -q --force svn://svn.tartarus.org/sgt/putty /Library/Caches/Homebrew/putty--svn-HEAD /code/pre  strongNOTE #1:/strong I believe the port used by Subversion is blocked by a corporate firewall.  strongNOTE #2:/strong I'm ultimately trying to work around an issue with the version of putty that's included in Brew.  precode$ brew install putty ==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/putty-0.63.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/putty-0.63.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; Pouring putty-0.63.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz   /usr/local/Cellar/putty/0.63: 11 files, 1.4M  $ puttygen privatekey.ppk -O private-openssh -o privatekey.pem Enter passphrase to load key: Assertion failed: (random_active), function random_byte, file ./unix/../sshrand.c, line 313. Abort trap: 6 /code/pre  <answer177092> The answer is to download the source from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html then place it where Homebrew will find it then execute your brew command.  Read https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Tips-N'-Tricks.md#pre-downloading-a-file-for-a-formula for tips on how to do it.  <answer191193> Run puttygen as codesudo/code and you'll be fine.  <comment209136> What is blocking the port? <comment209139> @Mark - thanks, forgot to mention that. <comment209144> Why --HEAD on the command line won't the normal install work and go to an archived version <comment209146> The version of putty in brew appears to be behind, best I can tell. When I did a brew install putty I noted that I got version 0.63, I believe there's a newer version 0.64, and the puttygen command that was demonstrated in the Q&A that I linked to did not work, giving me the same errors as noted in one of the comments. I was merely attempting to follow the advice left by the comment where someone said the `--HEAD` version fixed this particular issue. <comment209147> If you have a business need for this software then ask your system admin to allow you to get it or ask them to get it. Firewalls should be there for a reason and breaking business rules can get you fired :( <comment209151> Mark I'm simply attempting to download putty from an SVN repo, I'm not trying to bypass my firewall rules for nefarious purposes. Please do not preach to me, I'm a mod on one of the other SE sites and am merely trying to figure out how to workaround a issue! <comment209158> The question you asked should be answered as it is of use to many people but I have know people be sacked for doing this so I though a warning would be useful - and your system administrator should be a source of help
