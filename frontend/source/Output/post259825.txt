Exchange 2003 calendar events stopped syncing to iPhone 6+ NGAU2LL/A ios 10.1.1? <body> After updating, some* calendar events for an exchange account are not appearing on the phone. I deleted the account and re-added it, force closing the app and rebooting, force booting, and checking settings. Any ideas on how to fix or workaround this other than upgrading 2003? :)  Also found this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3012590   *A few old events are still on the calendar from that calendar and my google and facebook calendar events are still syncing, but nothing new since the 10.1.1 update
