MobileMe iDisk Folders  <body> What are the following (default) iDisk folders used for:  ul liBackup/li liGroups/li liLibrary/li liSites/li liSoftware/li liWeb/li /ul  If you delete them and wait a few minutes they will re-appear, but I do not know what they are used for. There is a document in them explaining their use, but it is still not clear.  <answer688> ul listrongBackup/strong is used by the MobileMe Backup application. I don't recommend using it.  /li listrongGroups/strong is for a now defunct Groups feature that they used to have.  /li listrongLibrary/strong is used for MobileMe's syncing feature - primarily for Preferences and Bookmarks.  /li listrongSites/strong is used for webpages or anything you want shared at codehttp://homepage.mac.com/username//code. Note: PHP files, CGI files, etc. don't work. It only works with static content./li listrongSoftware/strong contains free software provided by Apple to MobileMe customers (eg. the Backup application) - this doesn't affect your disk usage./li listrongWeb/strong is a folder used by iWeb - otherwise it's nearly identical to the Sites folder but is available at codehttp://web.me.com/username/code/li /ul  <comment590> Ah, so they are mostly useless for a lot of people. Wish they could be permanently removed :( <comment591> Why do you want to remove them ? They don't take any space (if empty).
