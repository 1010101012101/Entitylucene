guest access to samba shares on 10.8 <body> Is there any way to allow public (ie no user/password prompt) access to samba shares using the mountain lion built in server?   Even with Everyone set to read/write in System Preferences and the guest account enabled for sharing a password is always required when trying to connect from a windows computer (I've tried both 7 and xp).  <answer62899> Yep!  ul liGo to 'Users &amp; Groups' in System Preferences/li liSelect the 'Guest User'/li liTick 'Allow guests to connect to shared folders'/li /ul  Done :)  <comment89742> no effect for me though. <comment92910> Same for me. And the OP wrote that he tried this option, and that it didn't work. <comment93387> Hm, I've managed to reproduce this also. Try user: guest with no password. This works for me. You could script the drive mapping with the user 'guest' with no pass, or use the GUI to 'reconnect at login' with those credentials.
