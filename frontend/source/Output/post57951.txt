Mountain Lion sleeps too aggressively <body> For me, Mountain Lion always seems to sleep whenever there is no user action, even when the computer is still doing something. In my case it always sleeps in the middle of running a batch operation in Lightroom 4.1, and it has slept while Time Machine is still cleaning up.  According to Siracusa's ML review, apps need to be written to make "power assertions" if they want to stop the computer from sleeping. Otherwise, sleep it will. This seems like a way too aggressive strategy, especially to implement by default in a new OS? There must be many, many apps that have not been written to make these power assertions (including it seems parts of Apple's own Time Machine backup process).  Is there a hidden preference somewhere to revert to the old method of sleep at least until we get better app support for this? I'm not looking for a solution to supress sleep entirely (I know I can just tell the computer to never sleep), but rather to stop sleeping while it's still doing something.

To prevent any sleep at all, use code-s/code instead of code-i/code.  <answer61416> As a fellow media-server-from-an-iMac guy (I also use Subsonic to stream my iTunes library over the air to my phone) I feel your pain.  ** Oops, just saw the other answer - my 2nd option will still work though ** Try going to a terminal prompt and typing "man caffeinate" - I believe you can use that to script the power management assertion.   Or easier, download a free mini app for your taskbar called Caffeine, which toggles a no-sleep mode, which can even be set to persist for a period of time. Works for me. :-)  HTH  <comment66727> Since there are so many options to power management, have you isolated this to either on battery or on power (or both) and also consider listing the results of `pmset -g` and `pmset -g cap` in case your settings are not standard. The various log options of `pmset` may also be invaluable to see what is happening (or has happened) if the system.log isn't detailed enough for your needs. <comment68857> This is awesome and upvoted :) Definitely useful in a tight spot. However not really an adequate solution globally since I would manually need to run this on every process that's doing something. <comment69802> Same here. Updated to ML few days ago. I was watching a movie with my wife served from her iMac (as we always do) and the iMac slept at the defined time even though it was streaming the file!! Very annoying. It used to be perfect pre-ML where the sleep was prevented when there was activity. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1776?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US <comment70044> Yeah many people had problems with their Mac not sleeping, myself included. Now it seems the problem lies the other way round :) <comment71107> Yeah thanks :) I am aware of these solutions, however they are both manual. I am rather looking for a way for ML to automatically not sleep should there be I/O or CPU activity the way that previous versions of OS X has done.
