Set preview.app to default to "content only" view <body> Is there any way to make (Mountain Lion) Preview's default view 'content only'?  <answer90791> I was looking for something that would seem to be the opposite of what you wanted (i.e. to have all PDFs open and show the "Thumbnails" of each page, as is an option in the "View" menu.

Can't believe I missed that tick-box... <comment117996> This doesn't seem to work for previewing .doc files. Is this a bug, or does anyone have any other suggestions? <comment186317> There's no "Always show sidebar" option for images i.e. jpegs
