How can I get Apple mail or Outlook 2011 to look up SMIME encryption certificates for users? <body> I want the ability to lookup an encryption certificate for SMIME in Outlook for recipients who have SMIME certs, but I just don't have their public key.  I noticed the keychain has a directory feature.  Can I use this to add a compatible directory to lookup their public key for SMIME encryption?  <answer121676> Not sure if this would help, but yes, you can create and retrieve certificates to save in your keychain.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jwzn.png" alt="enter image description here"  You might also try this system:  Retrieved a free certificate from COMODO   http://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php.   Please ensure, that you always select "United States" as you country of residence. Otherwise, you will not get a proper private key embedded into you certificate.  Alternatively, you can look up the public key: Using WWW or email methods.  <answer123109> If your question were about PGP, then the answer would be you could download the recipient's public key from pgp.mit.edu , for example.  But as for S/MIME, the keystores are scattered.   It is weird, since it is straight-forward to publish 1  your S/MIME certificate .  But the idea does not seem to have taken off. Case in point, here 2 is an announcement from 6/2/2011  , about 3, which today (2014), seems to have 140 users.

Mail.app will also automatically search for certificates as well.  Unfortunately, I haven't done this personally, so I can't vouch for how well it works or have any advice on any issues.  This reads to me like a feature designed to be used with a centrally-managed IT infrastructure with directory and certificate services.  It does not sound like it is designed to work outside that sort of environment.
