Cannot delete contact from Address Book <body> I have a particular contact I cannot delete from Address Book.    There was a birthday event in calendar for a person I didn't recognize, so I tried to delete it.  However, Calendar said that I needed to delete it from Contacts, so I opened Address Book and tried to delete the contact.  Right-clicking on the contact's name did not list the option to delete it, the delete card option was grayed out in the Edit menu, and command+delete just make the computer beep.  I found this page with the below command to try.  precode{ sudo chflags -R nouchg,nouappnd ~ $TMPDIR.. ; sudo chown -R $UID:staff ~ $_ ; sudo chmod -R u+rwX ~ $_ ; chmod -R -N ~ $_ ; } 2&gt; /dev/null /code/pre  It looks like it goes through and changes the ownership of all your files to make sure they're actually yours.  Should I try this solution, or is there a better option to let me delete the unnecessary contact?  I'm running El Capitan, in case that makes the instructions any different.  <comment311158> That command looks safe. Should work. <comment311182> It did not work, still can't delete the card.  What kind of idiots designed this software? <comment352539> I have that problem with "Apple, Inc" and assumed it was just plain old arrogance of Apple. I could however delete thew hole address book that had that contact. So maybe make a new address book, move that contact into it, then delete it.
