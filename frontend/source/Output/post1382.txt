xD card is really slow to read in Mac OS 10.6.4 <body> I am having a bit of a problem transferring pictures off my Olympus 850SW digital camera (maybe it being pink has something to do with it).  h3When using the camera/h3  When connecting the camera to the computer I chose PCMTP and iPhoto opens and starts indexing thumbnails. It would sit there (iPhoto says "Loading Photos...") and nothing has happened. The LED on the camera is still flashing.  If I chose PCStorage then the computer does not react at all.  h3When using a card reader./h3  If I use an xD card reader similar thing happens. Doing import from iPhoto takes ages for one photo, browsing the car in Finder is equally slow. I can actually transfer files but it's painfully slow - takes about 6 minutes to transfer 50 MB.  What can I do to fix this issue? It strikes me as a system issue (i.e. OS dealing with the memory card), rather than the camera or the card reader.  h3When using either camera or reader with a PC/h3  Both work fine and photos get transferred pretty fast.  <answer1414> Have you tried opening “Image Capture” and see if it works from there? I’ve had similar problems in the past with my Kodak.  <comment1236> I gave Image Capture a go and got a similar issue. Too slow to be usable, when trying to import got an error saying images could not be transferred.
