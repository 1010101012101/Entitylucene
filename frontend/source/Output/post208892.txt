Restore photos from old iPhoto library backup to new Mac Photos app <body> I've old backup from my MacBook (2008-2010) iPhoto library on external HD, i wish to browse + select photos and merge them with my current iMac Photos app in El Capitan 10.11   <answer215163> I had the same problem. You've got to do:  ol liOpen PHOTOS while pressing OPTION key. Choose form a list your old iPhoto library. Either Photos will convert the old file or will direct you to a link on Apple where you can download an utility that will convert the file for you./li liIn any case you will have to repeat and open Photos with option key pressed. Choose the converted file./li liOnce it is opened you have to select all photos and EXPORT them to a folder in your desktop./li liThen you go through your filtering. After having all the photos you want in a folder, reopen Photos with the option key pressed. But now choose your regular Photo Library./li liThen you IMPORT the photos from the folder./li liIn case you need the convertion utility from Apple, here is the link: https://support.apple.com/pt-br/HT202358 . (It did not work for me. I think El capitan doesn't like these old utilities - from 2013.)/li /ol  Hope you succeed.
