How to remove Preview.app on-screen navigation toolbar? <body> When I open a picture in fullscreen, it has an overlay like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fs49V.jpg" alt="screenshot"  Is there a way to permanently disable it?  <answer165066> You are going into 'Slide show' not full screen.  This maybe because you are using the wrong shortcut keys.  For Slide show:  kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdf/kbd  For full screen:  kbdcmd/kbd+kbdcrtl/kbd+kbdf/kbd  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W97ww.png" alt="enter image description here"
