Send notification from command line <body> On Mac OS X, some applications will display a notification that appears briefly in the upper-right corner (e.g., when I receive email).  Is there a way to generate a notification from the command-line?  In other words, is there a command-line program I can run to display a custom notification, with text of my choice?  Ideally, I'd love to be able to run something like  precodeshow-notification "Hello world!" /code/pre  from a shell script and have a notification appear showing the text "Hello world!".  hr  I discovered I can use this answer to display a dialog box in the center of the screen that the user has to click "OK" on, but I'm looking for a notification not a modal dialog box.  <answer238820> The following works:  precodeosascript -e 'display notification "Hello world!" with title "Hi!"' /code/pre  <comment374032> You may also like to add `sound name "default"` at the end
