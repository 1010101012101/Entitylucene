Where are the Terminal settings stored on OS X? <body> You'd think A) I'd know this by now, and B) that it's readily available info, but apparently neither is the case.   What I'm looking for is where the config files (colors, etc.) that ship with Terminal are kept on the system. It'd be really handy to point to these in a code/dotfiles/setup.sh/code file.   Am I being oblivious? I've checked the package contents of Terminal.app, but nothing is there of note. It is also noteworthy, that OS X (at least Mountain Lion) will include Terminal settings, sessions, and scripts as pre-defined search parameters in Finder, but I have found nothing.   I've searched online, and dug deep into code/usr//code and code/Library/code. Nothing. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.  <answer63063> The preferences appear to be at: code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist/code  See also this question on SO.  <comment72794> See: `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist` <comment72795> See also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8350065/reload-com-apple-terminal-plist <comment72796> @PaulR: Add your first comment as an answer and I'll upvote the crap out of it.
