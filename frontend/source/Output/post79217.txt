Can I import photos from iPad to iMac that aren't in camera roll? <body> I lost all data on my iMac recently, including some 1500 photos.  These photos were synced to the iPad from iPhoto on my iMac.   How can I transfer them back to my iMac since they are not in the camera roll on my iPad?  <answer79262> iExplorer is an app that does the trick. I just tested it, and it works.  So it's quite simple and straightforward. Launch the app, and select you iPad from the sources, there will be a Photos section, and everything should be there.  The same thing happened to me once, but I used Time Machine to backup. It must be terrifying, anyway, hope it helps!  <comment168739> seems to work well
