Yosemite with exchange server : Inbox email is not updated with the latest message <body> I have tried this on both Outlook for Mac 2011 and native Mail app on Yosemite.

I can only download the latest email if I empty the cache or re-create the account.  <comment207741> what is it? a gmail ? a IMAP gmail? <comment207742> exchange  server
