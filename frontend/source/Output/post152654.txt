Try to find the installer somewhere else. For example: http://download.cnet.com/Apple-Mac-OS-X-Mavericks/3000-18513_4-76018588.html  <answer169352> @OP: If you have the update... Download it but DONT install it... Go to /Library/Updates and in there is where the update pkg file lives... Copy (don't delete it or cut it) out of there and install manually. Watch the logs.. i.e. note before and after times!  If it asks you to reboot.. Don't... So ti'll probably try and install.. But get the package anyway...  Install that manually...  In steps:  ol liDownload and install the update/li liAfter installation, don't restart/li liDrop to terminal or use finder and goto (cmd+shift+g) /Library/Updates/li liCopy the OS X update to somewhere else i.e. on your desktop/li liRestart and see if the update worked/li liIf it worked... Stop here :D/li liIf not... Fire up "Console" in Utilities under your applications..../li liNote the time of the logs under "All Messages"/li liInstall the update by double clicking on it and install it as you would any other pkg file/li liAfter the install, reboot./li liGo back to console.. Note the end time!!!!/li liIf it worked! Stop here :D/li liIf it didn't work, can you go through the logs and see if anything fails or complains and come back with that?/li /ol  <comment179689> You are showing the Yosemite OS ?
