How to batch download all files in a Volafile.io room? <body>    Volafile.io Live Filesharing &amp; Chat   Example URL: codehttps://volafile.io/r/$ID/code.   There is Feature request: Download all the content of a room in a .zip file. #117. I don't wish to depend on that feature request.  How to download all files in a Volafile.io room? I prefer a command line solution (Open Source, installable by codehomebrew/code), something like what's codeyoutube-dl/code for YouTube.  codeJdwonloader/code at the moment doesn't support Volafile.io. If there is no CLI solution, how to do that with GUI?  <answer232776> Firefox Downthemall! extension (free from mozilla)   Highlight all files you want to get. Right click and select download selection.  Alternatively, you can just right click, tell it to download all, pick the all files filter and download folder and watch it go.  It will even skip or rename duplicate files as you request.  Works perfect and is free.  ~edit 28Mar2016- Were you able to try the method suggested?  Did it work for you?  <comment283653> Could you provide a real URL so I can test against some CLI Utilities? <comment295578> thanks. I upvoted you. The "Firefox Downthemall! extension" works fine, but I prefer a command line solution. <comment295579> the URL expire very fast :-(
