How to delay hibernation after sleep in Mac mini? <body> When I press a power button on my Mac mini, it goes to sleep mode and when I press it again, it turns on very quickly. However, after a longer sleep, it hibernates. How can I make this delay longer?  I know that I have tu use codepmset/code but I don't know how exactly. Should I change the codestandbydelay/code?

See codeman pmset/code:  precodestandby causes kernel power management to automatically hibernate a machine after it has slept for a specified time period. This saves power while asleep. This setting defaults to ON for supported hardware. The setting standby will be visible in pmset -g if the feature is supported on this machine.  standby only works if hibernation is turned on to hibernatemode 3 or 25.  standbydelay specifies the delay, in seconds, before writing the hiberna- tion image to disk and powering off memory for Standby. /code/pre  Standby mode is also documented in http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4392.
