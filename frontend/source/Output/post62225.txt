work-around for the absense of "save-as" in OS X 10.7 <body> Is there a more convenient work-around for Apple's decision to drop the "save as" command than clicking on duplicate, then save the copy which then displays the file structure?  I have tried the app "Default Folders" and it does not solve the problem (at least in my hands).  thanks for your assistance  <answer62230> I'm afraid not. You could, though, add a shortcut to the emDuplicate/em command, to make it more like the emSave as/em. To do so just:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Keyboard Shortcuts/strong./li liSelect emApplication Shortcuts/em and click the add button./li liSet it to strongAll Applications/strong and enter codeDuplicate/code as emMenu Title/em. It's case sensitive, so make sure it's written with a capital D./li liChoose a keyboard shortcut and hit emAdd/em./li /ol  strongMountain Lion/strong, by the way, has the emSave As/em command back. Holding down kbdOption/kbd while clicking the emFile/em menu, will turn the emDuplicate/em command into emSave as.../em.  <comment71889> I found this article very useful, not only for work-arounds but also as a general commentary on Apple's new document model: http://tidbits.com/article/13187
