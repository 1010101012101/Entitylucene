Preventing google search for custom top-level domain <body> How can I prevent safari to redirect the user to the google search page for addresses with custom top-level domains?  Given an address of the type http://application.test where test is a primary zone on our intranet, if I enter either:  ul lihttp://application.test/li liapplication.test//li /ul  Then Safari correctly resolves the name and opens the page, if I enter:  ul liapplication.test/li /ul  Then Safari assumes it is a search query and redirects the user to the google search page.  Is it possible to prevent this in any way which does not involve the user itself?  <comment97722> May be you should turn off web suggestions and/or use private mode to go to your intranet domains
