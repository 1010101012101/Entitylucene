Weird OS X Terminal Bug: Cursor won't go back to end of line after backtracking <body> I have an interesting problem: when I type something in the terminal as follows:   precode~ me$ hello&lt;cursor&gt; /code/pre  and backtrack:  precode~ me$ he&lt;cursor&gt;llo /code/pre  and then try to return to the end to continue typing, perhaps after fixing an error, I get stuck before the last character:  precode~ me$ hell&lt;cursor stuck here&gt;o /code/pre  Anyone know how to fix this? I've tried looking around and changing the terminal to xterm instead of xterm-256-color, etc. but no luck. Any help is greatly appreciated!  Edit: I am using the arrow keys to move back and forth.  <answer127755> Since I don't have enough reps to add this as a comment, I'll have to ask this in the stronganswer/strong section (even though it's discouraged).  First, how are you trying to move the cursor? Are you using the strongarrow keys/strong or are you using the basic strongvi/strong commands? i.e. have you tried: kbd$/kbd ?  Anyway, it would be helpful if you gave more detail as to the specific keys you're pressing in the example you provided (i.e. whether arrows or shortcuts and, if the latter, which specific key combinations).  <answer199731> I know this is an old question, but I've been beating my head over this for a few days now and I've finally got it. It turns out the solution is simple: strongupdate bash to 4.3/strong. The default bash on Macs (even Yosemite) is 3.2.  Install Homebrew with  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  then do  precodebrew install bash /code/pre  then change your default shell path (in Terminal Preferences) to  precode/usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  and that's it. Check your bash version with  precodebash --version /code/pre  and as an added bonus, you can get mode indicators!  precodebind 'set show-mode-in-prompt on' /code/pre  and it will show a code+/code for Insert mode and code:/code for Command mode.  <comment148497> Have you ever modified your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc files? <comment148505> No, but I have a modified ~/.inputrc file, which was copied from here to make some improvements: https://github.com/whiteinge/dotfiles/blob/master/.inputrc <comment148589> Can't figure out why but it's it that causes the issue.
