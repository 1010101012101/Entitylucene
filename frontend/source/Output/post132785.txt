Switch GPU based on power source <body> Is there a way to use a high performance GPU when my MBP is connected to AC power and use automatic switching when it's on battery? I have latest OSX and Mid 2012 MacBook Pro if that matters.   <answer132787> I do not recall if gfxCardStatus allows you to adjust the usage of the card on different power systems or not but worth investigating.  <comment157250> [Power source based switching was removed](http://gfx.io/switching.html#power-source-based-switching) <comment157282> Yep, gfxCardStatus can't do it.
