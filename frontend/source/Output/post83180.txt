What does (MM) mean in the iPad model lineup? <body> While looking at iPad models, I notice several showing as (MM).  In particular, the 4th generation iPad mini with Cellular has models A1454 and  A1455 with the latter being labeled (MM). The same exists for A1459/A1460 on the larger iPad with a Retina display.  What does MM represent?  <answer83183> I think it may be Mobility Management, which is a part of a cellular protocol. I'm not familiar with it, but here's the Wikipedia page. I'm an engineer dealing with cellular, so I'm actually gonna read this myself.  <answer101039> Millennial media. It is just a media platform.  <answer101055> The MM or Millenium Media according to what I can find, refers to the CDMA variation of the Cellular iPad for Verizon Networks.  The non MM version is for GSM carriers like AT&amp;T.  h2Source:/h2  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5093889?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer101066> I do not have a direct link or citation on/about Apple to prove my conclusion. But the most logical answer I could gather by reading several sites is that strongMM/strong would stand for strong"Multi-mode",/strong signifying that the iPad supports not just CDMA and GSM, but also emmultiple/em LTE implementations. The term "multimode" or "multi-mode" is used to designate chips/devices that support multiple, disparate communication technologies (a device with WiFi and Bluetooth can be called multimode too, but we're talking only about cellular here. Plus, all of Apple's iDevices have had WiFi and Bluetooth in all models).  ul liOnly the strongGSM + CDMA + LTE models that support multiple carriers/strong have the strong"MM"/strong tag.br Example: The em4th generation iPad/em and the emiPad mini/em have models that support CDMA/GSM/LTE on emVerizon and Sprint./em So they're marked as "Cellular (MM)" to give them a more substantial (and carrier neutral) name./li liThe strongGSM + CDMA + LTE models in older generations that support only Verizon/strong have a strong"VZ"/strong tag instead of the "MM" tag.br Example: The 3rd generation iPad, the first iPad to come with support for both CDMA and GSM on a single device, has a CDMA/GSM/LTE emVerizon model, but it does not support Sprint./em So it's marked as "Cellular (VZ)" to signify that it's tied to Verizon (and cannot work with another CDMA carrier like Sprint)./li /ul  In emApple's current terminology/em:br strong"Cellular"/strong implies strongGSM+LTE/strongbr strong"Cellular (MM)"/strong implies strongGSM+CDMA+LTE (across CDMA carriers)/strong    emNote that there is no "CDMA only" version of the iPad after the iPad 2, unlike "GSM only" versions that have been and continue to be available./em  You can come to similar conclusions by comparing the cellular support across iPad models/generations and how they relate to the chipsets used, the carriers supported, and their technology implementations.    Here are some links related to the iPad specs across generations and multi-mode (as it applies to cellular technology) that would help understand my conclusion better.  Technical specifications for iPads of different generations (pay attention to the technologies/carriers supported):br 1. iPad (4th Generation) - Technical Specificationsbr 2. iPad mini - Technical Specificationsbr 2. iPad (3rd Generation) - Technical Specificationsbr 3. iPad 2 - Technical Specifications    Links related to multi-mode (read them completely or search for "mode" to go to multimode related snippets on these pages):br 1.

Wither way, win!) That link makes MM look like part of a GSM spec, which could make sense to call it that over the CDMA version of iOS devices. <comment118962> Is there anything else you can addâ€¦ ? <comment119266> It's the CDMA *and* GSM (dual mode) devices that Apple calls as MM. So the MM that Apple uses cannot be a GSM specific aspect.
