Macbook Air not waking up from Suspend/Sleep with rEFInd boot manager installed <body> Having installed both rEFInd 0.6.10 (updated to 0.6.11) via its codeinstall.sh/code and Ubuntu 13.04 on another partition I can now choose on a MacBook Air to boot either MacOS or Linux.  When running MacOS and closing and soon re-opening the lid, everything is fine, but after a longer time of closed lid, the machine is not waking/starting up. Instead I have to long-press the power button and then press it again to boot the machine.  <answer91531> I had the same exact issue with my MacBook Pro and I have rEFInd installed as well. I resolved the problem disabling the codeautopoweroff/code option with codepmset/code. See this answer.  <answer91578> If you want to prevent Macbook going from codesleep mode/code into codestandby mode/code (dump RAM to SSD) too soon, you could also adjust by changing codepmset/code's codestandbydelay/code value.  codesudo pmset -g/code to check current setting  codesudo pmset -a standbydelay [value]/code to update settting  But instead of changing codepmset/code configuration (which affects your battery life), try using the original coderEFIt/code instead, the installation is as simple as the forked project coderEFInd/code, and I no longer experience any wake-up problem on my Macbook Air 5.2 (Mid 2012 version/OS X 10.8)  Reference Links:  http://refit.sourceforge.net/  https://askubuntu.com/questions/295105/refind-breaks-standby-mode-on-macbook-air-5-2/296514  <comment107507> Thanks a lot, seems to have worked already by resetting SMC. <comment107551> Actually not, MBA was on AC power when tested, so it didn't go into Deep Sleep ... <comment107803> With rEFIt installed OSX wakes up nicely, and refit offers an entry of the previous installed rEFInd where I can still boot Ubuntu, fine.
