Issues with Anki and BasicTeX <body> My last Mac worked with Anki to display LaTeX formatted equations but I am still, but I haven't been able to transfer it over.  My steps thus far:   ol liI obviously downloaded and installed Anki and BasicTeX (don't want the size of MacTeX). /li liI use an equation in my cards with proper formatting and get the error others have reported on: /li /ol  codeError executing dvipng. Generated file: /var/folders/x2/8dh4jx2j64n9tvvts_l2pqk00000gp/T/anki_temp/tmp.tex/code  ol start="3" liMy understanding is that dvipng comes bundled with BasicTex so this is pretty perplexing. /li liI tried the extension https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/937148547 but it is not working. When I type codewhich latex/code (and a million other variants), it cannot be found. /li liI tried following the advice from the top answer here: How can I get LaTeX working on Anki?, but when I use codetlmgr update --self &amp;&amp; tlmgr install dvipng/code, I get that the tlmgr command is not found (same thing when I sudo it.)/li /ol  Other information: I am running all of this on a MacBook Pro with El Capitan installed.  <comment273735> The default location for BasicTex's latex command is `/Library/TeX/texbin/latex`. Would you mind adding the output of both `which latex`, `stat /Library/TeX/texbin/latex` and `ls -l /usr/local/texlive/2015basic` (substitute the year of your installation if applicable)? Also, your `echo $PATH` would be helpful.
