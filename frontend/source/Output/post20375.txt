How to delete OS X Lion installer app <body> I re-downloaded the OS X Lion installer app to burn a DVD.  After burning the DVD I put the installer files in the trash.  Now when I try to clear the trash, I get a message basically saying I only have Read Only permissions on the file, and can't delete it.  The permissions don't appear to be editable.  How can I get rid of the file?  <answer20380> Have you tried rebooting before removing it from Trash again? That helps in such cases sometimes.   If that doesn't work, try opening Terminal, and entering:  precodecd .Trash sudo rm Install\ Mac\ OS\ X\ Lion.app /code/pre  <answer20430> You can also force quit (press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdEscape ⎋/kbd keys then select the application from the list) the application used to burn the Lion installer since this locked access to the file thus cannot be completely deleted.  <comment22546> Rebooting did it - thanks!
