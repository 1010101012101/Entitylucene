Shell not finding commands after I changed my .bash_profile file <body> I was following a tutorial trying to install Laravel (5.0). The tutorial showed to add codeexport PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel"/code to the code.bash_profile/code document. Since then, I am not able to execute any command (nano, ssh, etc).  Nothing happens when I executed this in terminal:  precodeexport PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel" /code/pre  My code.bash_profile/code looks like this:  precodeexport PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/bin:$PATH /code/pre  I tried logging out, restarting and entering the following commands:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile . .bash_profile /code/pre  Can anyone help?  <answer164491> What you did is to overwrite the codePATH/code variable. This removed every other path that was in your codePATH/code before from the variable.  You need to do the following:  precodeexport PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel:$PATH" /code/pre  This emadds/em the Laravel bin path to the system paths where SSH etc. are located.  <answer164492> When you did:  precodeexport PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel" /code/pre  You changed the system default codePATH/code to something nearly useless. You should never emreplace/em codePATH/code, you should only emappend/em to codePATH/code.  Remove the following two lines from your code~/.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/bin:$PATH export PATH="~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel" /code/pre  And replace them with the following:  precodepathadd() {     if [ -d "$1" ] &amp;&amp; [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$1:"* ]]; then         PATH="${PATH:+"$PATH:"}$1"     fi } pathadd /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.10/bin pathadd ~/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel export PATH /code/pre  This is a safe way to append to your codePATH/code environment variable. It only does the append if the path isn't already in the list.  <comment192857> I did as you suggested however, I am still not able to use nano or SSH commands. <comment192858> You have to quit existing shell sessions and start new ones. Or run: `source ~/.bash_profile`. <comment192859> Ah ha! I had to quit Terminal after using `source ~/.bash_profile`. Now everything works. Thank you! <comment192870> Why bother having `pathadd`? Just do like Lukas Bestle said. <comment192871> Lukas' answer is dangerous if you end up in a situation where you have sub-shells that re-read your `.bash_profile` -- you get overlong PATH env vars and that can be both problematic for predictable executable locations and for path searching speed. <comment193237> `~` won't be expanded to the user's home folder if it's in quotes (even double-quotes). Either use `export PATH=~/".composer/vendor/bin/laravel:$PATH"`, or `export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin/laravel:$PATH"`
