No sound MacBook Pro 2016 13" touchbar macOS Sierra 10.12.2 <body> My new macbook laptop keeps losing the sound, anyone knows anything I can do besides restarting or logging out?   Last time It fixed itself automagically, it's a macbook pro 2016, 13" with touchbar  I can even hear a tick when I switch from hdmi to the headphones but it wont output any sound from youtube or VLC or anything else.  I can only hear Siri.  I can't afford to be restarting my computer manually every time this happens.  On linux I can restart the service and fix it but I don't know how to do it in mac.  OS Version: macOs Sierra 10.12.2  <answer266635> Fixed it with codesudo killall coreaudiod/code  <answer275785> I called Apple Care and they took care of this problem. I shut down the computer first and immediately as I turned it back on, I pressed down kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbd on the strongleft/strong side and the kbdR/kbd and kbdP/kbd keys simultaneously for 20 secs as I was told to do.   The audio problem and display flickering both went away. Apple Care did this with me just via phone and took less than 5 min!  <answer277243> If your Control Strip stops working after codesudo killall coreaudiod/code try codesudo killall ControlStrip/code afterwards.  <answer277992> I don't have enough reputation to leave a comment, but in response to evolutionxbox's comment:  After running codesudo killall coreaudiod/code in the Terminal, I made the volume controls work again by putting the machine to sleep and then waking it back up.  <answer287096> I experienced this problem with a MBP 13" TB, which I use with AirPods. Probably the combination of using Airpods/a bluetooth audio device is what's causing this problem.  What worked for me was:  ol lisudo killall coreaudiod/li lisudo killall ControlStrip/li liOpen/Close laptop lid/li /ol  <comment339082> I'm having the same problem on a 2016 15" MacbookPro. Only your "sudo killall coreaudiod" (or restarting) sorted it out. Are you using by chance any wireless/bluetooth earphones from time to time? I'm trying to reproduce the bug, and it usually happens after listening to music/videos with my AirPods. Submitted a bug though to Apple, just in case). By the way, did you experienced it outside Mac OS (Linux/Windows)? Could it be hardware related? <comment347006> Just so everyone knows, the process you followed is called _resetting the NVRAM_, and the steps you took are only for (at this stage) the new 2016 MacBook Pro computers. Anyone looking to resolve a similar issue with any other Mac can refer to my answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/256509/168832). <comment348692> This "worked", as in I can hear sound again, but now the volume control doesn't work. <comment350901> `killall coreaudiod && killall ControlStrip` ftw <comment373787> This made the volume control work again - presumably by restarting `CoreAudioD` somehow.  Perhaps we could manually restart coreaudiod via `launchctl`? <comment373788> It looks like `coreaudiod` doesn't restart itself (unless you shut/reopen the laptop lid).  Perhaps we could manually restart coreaudio daemon via `launchctl`? <comment373841> killall coreaudiod && killall ControlStrip  and closing and opening the lid fixed it for me, included working volume control.
