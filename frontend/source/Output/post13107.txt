How to copy paste Xcode warnings? <body> Is there a way to copy paste the content of this warnings in Xcode ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMo1m.png" alt="xcode error"  <answer13109> I know it's possible in Xcode 4.  Just click the warning (or error), then press kbdCmd ⌘/kbd-kbdC/kbd to copy.  It will copy the file path as well, but the warning/error text will be at the end of the string.  <answer13110> Yes.  If you go to the Issue Navigator (kbdcmd/kbd-kbd4/kbd), you'll see a list of build warnings and errors.  You can select one from the list and hit kbdcmd/kbd-kbdc/kbd.  You'll get something like this:     /Users/dave/Developer/Cocoa/EmptyFoundation/EmptyFoundation.m:180:15:{178:2-178:6}{178:2-178:7}: warning: conversion specifies type 'unsigned long long' but the argument has type 'NSUInteger' (aka 'unsigned long') [-Wformat,7]   <answer117249> Click on your error or select the section and on your Apple Keyboard, tap the following : ⌘ + C to copy it and ⌘ + V to paste it.
