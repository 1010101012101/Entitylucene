Notes has Google Notes. But Google has no such service. Where are they stored? <body> If you go to System Preferences - Internet Accounts and add a Google account, you can see Google has Notes. If you open strongNotes/strong (OS X app), it somehow retrieves the notes I had put long long time ago on a different Mac. So, I am sure those notes are not locally stored. Not only can I see old notes, but I can also add new notes to Google Notes.  Google had Notebook service, but it was discontinued long time ago and existing notes were imported into Google Docs. But I cannot find the notes I see in strongNotes/strong in Google Docs.  So where are the Google Notes stored and strongNotes/strong is getting the notes from? Is it that Google discontinued the web interface of the Notebook service but somehow still provides an interface to Apple especially? Can I access the notes I saved to Google Notes in strongNotes/strong outside the strongNotes/strong application, in a web browser for example?  <answer227778> In you enable the sync, the notes are saved as "emSent mails/em" in Gmail. Sometimes this can be very annoying, since a new sent email is created every time you just modify a previous note. I had enabled once, but now I get rid of this sync option.  <answer229360> The notes created in OS X can be found in Google Inbox under unbundled label "emNotes/em". If you create a folder with [name] in OS X Notes app, the notes will be synced to Google Inbox unbundled label "emNotes/name/em".  <comment277706> No, I cannot find notes in Drafts. My Gmail Drafts are empty. <comment277707> Sorry, try on "sent mails". I have notes there <comment277917> No, I cannot see them in Sent either. I put a weird phrase in Notes and searched Gmail, Keep, Google Docs for that phrase, but there was no result. <comment279892> I found it. I wonder why I did not see it before.
