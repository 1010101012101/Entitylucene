Why doesn't OS X Spotlight search inside .json files? <body> I am trying to search a folder for an ID number. The folder contains various different file types. The ID can be found in several strong.json/strong files, but non of them show up.   If I rename the strong.json/strong file to strong.json2/strong or strong.jsont/strong then the files show up in the search: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cHTGj.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I try and use terminal and codemdfind/code it is the same, strong.json/strong files wouldn't show up when searching for the ID.  Is there some setting I need to change such that spotlight/codemdfind/code will search inside strong.json/strong files? Or will I have to rename all files?  Note: Some of the .json files are quite large (~16 MB). Does this matter?  <answer119074> You could try adding JSON to the Spotlight RichText importer.  The process for XHTML is described here, and should be analogous for JSON:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2013Jun/0079.html  <comment138633> possible duplicate (but without answer) of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86852/finder-spotlight-tool-not-grepping-through-all-file-types <comment138673> This is very interesting. Even after adding "json" to the Richtext.mdimport Spotlight file and re-indexing it will still not show the file in the results when searching for text that is in the contents of a JSON file. It will show JSON files in the results if they are searched for by name though... odd...
