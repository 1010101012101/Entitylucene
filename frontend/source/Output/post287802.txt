MacOS Sierra Keyboard layout changes to Windows keyboard layout in Microsoft Remote Desktop <body> I use the most recent version of Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection [v8.0.40] to connect to my Windows PC at work. When the connection establishes on the Windows 10 environment, Mac's keyboard layout doesn't work. Thus I have to use different combinations of the keys to work on the remote desktop. It is very annoying as I am very much used to using command instead of ctrl and could not remap my keyboard layout. Is there anyone who can suggest a fix?   The previous versions of RDC app were working fine and I Mac's Keyboard layout was operating well on Windows platform. Following is a list of details on my two devices:  The remote Windows: OS Name Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise Version 10.0.10586 Build 10586  Mac OS: 10.12.5  <answer287807> There are currently two versions of RDC available; release 8.0.xx &amp; beta 8.2.xx - If one doesn't behave as you'd expect, I'd try the other.   Beta from Microsoft Technet blog  More specifically, the Release version has emalways/em made you switch to using Windows standard kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd C /kbd kbd X /kbd kbd V /kbd etcbr The Beta allows you to use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  kbd C /kbd kbd X /kbd kbd V /kbd &amp; even though still a beta, is actually better in many respects.
