Upgrade to Yosemite - YES / NO <body> I have MacBook Pro 15" Retina late 2013 16GB memory / 500GB flash and it came with Mavericks. Should I upgrade to Yosemite? I have read many comments / blogs pointing out specific issues related to overtaxing the battery, mail program dysfunction, computer booting problems, and slow cursor to state a few. Knowing, if in fact, these exist as real issues, creating a separate partition to test Yosemite is a non starter. If however, these are not problems specific to the new Retina 15", then I would give it a try. Or should I wait until a new Yosemite is released with acknowledged "fixes".    <answer152239> strongSolution 1/strong  ul liTry it yourself. Create a second partition and install Yosemite on it. Play around to see wether is working for you or nit/li /ul  strongSolution 2/strong  ul liInstall Yosemite on an external hard drive to play around without messing up your current installation/li /ul  For myself, I am running Yosemite on a MacBook Air 2011, 4GB RAM and 128GB of storage. Everything is working just fine.
