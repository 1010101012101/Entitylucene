How to move PDFs from iPhone to Auto Flip <body> How do I Load pdfs from folders on my iPhone to ITunes to then move them to the Auto Flip app  <comment279976> Can you please describe in more detail what your goal and your setup is here? Where are the PDFs stored (there is no user-visible concept of folders in iOS), are there in Dropbox or similar? Why do you want to involve iTunes (on the iPhone I assume)?
