make custom user agent change permanent <body> I need to navigate a site that makes use of javascript that checks for user agent and only permits IE9.0 (don't ask). I am using safari and can set IE 9 in the user agent submenu of the develop menu. However, when the site directs me to another page in its collection, an exception is thrown because the new page sees I am using Safari. Reseting the user agent in the develop menu does not work because the page reloads as a safari user agent. Yes I edited the com.apple.Safari plist to include the following item:  precodeKey:    CustomUserAgent class:  String value:  Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0) /code/pre  But safari deletes that entry every time it opens a new tab/window and reverts to default! The plist reverts back to 'normal'.   Is there a way to make this change permanent?  <answer148326> You can set it with defaults write:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari CustomUserAgent "\"useragentstring\"" /code/pre  <comment174742> What exactly is the difference to what OP tried? <comment174743> @Max OP's value doesn't seem to be enclosed in quote marks, and I'm not entirely sure how OP edited the plistâ€”can't hurt to try the more 'official' way, not to mention the peculiarities with Containers/ByHost/etc. <comment174744> So you say editing config files is deprecated? I NEVER use `defaults`. <comment174745> @Max Not at all, just that I've experienced peculiarities editing certain plists manually, especially since the sandboxing with containers and system plists. Also the string should be `"value"` rather than just `value`. <comment174765> Welcome to Ask Different!
