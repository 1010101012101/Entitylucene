Is there a dial from Addres Book and tel:/sip: protocol handler script/application available for 10.7? <body> We are currently using Mac OS X 10.6 and strongsnomURLHandler/strong to convert tel: uri's to a http GET request. This computer telephony integration let us click on a telephone number in Address Book.app and let our desktop phone dial the number.  As snomURLHandler version 1.0 by Alastair J. Houghton (2004) is compiled to strongPowerPC/strong code, and the Rosetta component to run PowerPC code is no longer available in 10.7 (Lion), this situation is blocking upgrade to 10.7 (Lion).  What alternatives are available for snomURLHandler, preferrably a strongscript or application/strong that can be used as a general strongtel: and sip: protocol handler/strong (to call links starting with tel: and sip: from a web browser) and also be used from Address Book.app?  Note: We are aware of Telify add-on. That is not what is asked for, as Telify only works in one browser (Firefox) and cannot be used from Address Book.app  <answer55425> You can use the DefaultApps prefpane to specify custom URL handling, along with a lot of other features.  It hasn't been updated in quite awhile, but works fine on 10.6.8 and I believe on 10.7.4.  <answer75816> The source code of snomURLHandler is available at http://alastairs-place.net/hg/snomURLHandler/file/eb798e1a6dc8  Download that source code and compile this to an application using Xcode.  <comment63620> We are looking for the converter, from "tel: and sip:" to "http://". We are not looking for a mechanism to configure it in the OS. <comment63622> You may get more appropriate visibility for your problem on [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/). Have you tried posting there? <comment63624> @ephsmith Have tried superuser once with a Mac question, that was immediately being redirected back to apple.stackexchange.com because it was Mac OX related. <comment63628> What's the functional difference of using a "script or application" versus creating a system-wide hook?  Do you need to only allow tel:/sip: requests to be redirected to http: from one specific application instead of system-wide (which seems unlikely)? <comment63641> The difference is that some data format conversion needs to be done. For example `tel:+1987654321` should be converted `http://192.168.0.1/command.htm?number=000011987654321&outgoing_uri=123@domain1` plus some http authentication headers need to be created. <comment63643> sorry to hear that.  It was just a thought. I wasn't trying to redirect. <comment63650> @ephsmith Your "redirection" was read as helpfulness, and is being appreciated. <comment63795> Should've included that in your original post.
