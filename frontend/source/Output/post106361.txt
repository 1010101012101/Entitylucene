My MacBook Air does not turn on <body> My MacBook Air is nearly 1.5 years old and suddenly it stopped switching on.  I tried SMC reset and param reset, but no use. I'm not sure if I did reset properly, however.  <comment124978> Just for clarity, when you press the power button nothing happens?  The display doesn't light up, nothing is displayed on the display, no fan noise, etc? <comment125125> Nothing happens, no fan no noise. But I observed that if I leave it for few hours then if I switch on, once it boots up. But screen goes off after few seconds, it shows only apple screen. Immediately if I try again nothing happens.
