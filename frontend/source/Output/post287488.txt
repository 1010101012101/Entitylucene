Switch between windows (not applications) in both directions <body> I can't switch between windows smoothly. On Windows I could use Ctrl+Tab to scroll through all open Windows and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to scroll in the other direction.  On the Mac, I use Cmd+Tab to scroll through applications and Cmd+` (key above tab) to scroll through open Windows, but this is not intuitive as my mental model is more interested in my task divided into windows than applications.  Is there anyway - I don't mind learning a new key combo and would like some visual representation of where I am (nice to have). Crucially, I want it to be something really simple like the Windows keys that just roll through a bunch of windows, regardless of application.  EDIT: Paying £14 for Witch in order to get this functionality is frankly ridiculous, is there an OSX way of doing it?  <answer287489> strongWitch/strong is an app for switching between windows of any application.     Witch allows you to switch directly between not only applications (as you can do with Command-Tab), but windows as well. Instead of switching applications first, then windows, use Witch to switch directly to your desired window.   <answer287493> Another possible option for you is to use strongMission Control/strong.   Mission Control shows all windows as overlays on your screen. You can also set your Mission Control preferences (Apple  System Preferences  Mission Control) to group windows by application.  By default you can access Mission Control by pressing the Mission Control key (usually the F3 key - see image below), or pressing the kbdcontrol/kbd + kbd⬆︎/kbd keyboard shortcut, although this may depend on how you've configured your shortcuts in System Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ef0qh.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you're using a MacBook and/or trackpad you can also access Mission Control by swiping up with three fingers.  For more information you can refer to Use Mission Control on your Mac.  strongNote:/strong The feedback I've had from users is that it takes a little while to get used to, but that it's well worth persisting. So I recommend you stick with it for a little while to see if it works for you.  <comment362992> Avoiding a £14 fee for this basic functionality would be good if possible
