Question about unlocking via Bluetooth keyboard in iOS 10 <body> In my current workflow under iOS 9, I occasionally unlock my iPhone SE by pressing a button on my Bluetooth keyboard which would unlock it, and since I have TouchID and a passcode enabled I also proceed to type in my passcode, and then it is unlocked. (So I press any key provided Bluetooth keyboard is already connected and immediately follow with my passcode, and I'm in.)  In iOS 10, I understand that Apple redesigned the functioning of the lock screen in various ways (raise to wake, no slide to unlock, and you must press the home button to unlock, not just TouchID, though that one has an option to use the old method (right? Because that would be annoying.)). My question is, if I upgrade, would the Bluetooth keyboard workflow I described above be the same as it is now?
