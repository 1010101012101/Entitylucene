How to get the chrome tabs to always show when in full screen mode? <body> I would really like to use Chrome on my new 2013 Macbook Air with tabs, but without the menu bar.  So, I use full-screen mode, but it hides the tabs.  Is what I want possible?  And, if so, how can I get it to work that way?  <answer94832> This is an issue with the viewing mode.  Here's another article that describes the behavior in further detail.   strongPresentation Mode/strong Full-screen without tabs.  strongFull-screen Mode/strong Full-screen with tabs.  <answer107206> Go to strongView Enter Full Screen/strong.  To hide the tabs again, go to strongView  Enter Presentation Mode/strong.  <answer113736> Shift-CMD-F is for presentation mode and will hide the tabs.  You want full screen mode instead, so use Control-CMD-F.  Tabs will show in full screen mode.  <answer121541> chrome://flags, look for "Enables simplified fullscreen", make sure you set it to disabled.  <answer121548> It sounds like youâ€™re trying to enter strongFull Screen Mode/strong with codeCommand+Shift+F/code. Like what others have mentioned, you have to use codeShift+Command+F/code to enter strongFull Screen Mode/strong (with tabs available) instead of strongPresentation Mode/strong where tabs are hidden.  But if you want to use codeCommand+Shift+F/code for strongFull Screen/strong mode, open Keyboard Preferences and change Presentation Mode shortcut to other key combination, eg. codeOption+Shift+F/code. Here is the screenshot for the explanation above.
