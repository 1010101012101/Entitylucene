Yosemite freezes at log out <body> I'm not the only one having issues since I've installed Yosemite. My issue is quite simple and occurs sometimes at logout only. When I close my session, or any other session I have on this machine, the menu bar at the top of the screen just disappears and stops completely.  I can open applications, settings and almost everything except a Finder window. So I guess this issue is linked to the Finder. For almost 6 months, I'm struggling with that issue and no way to find the root cause.   Update: I've just done a complete reinstall but the problem still exists.
