How to delete a file using the delete key <body> I want to use only the delete key in order to delete files in Finder — no key combinations.  So far, I have been unable to find a configuration entry or even a 3rd party app that allow me to change the default behavior of OSX.  I'm using several systems, and OS X is only one of them. Having some consistency is great. I really want that behavior as it seems straightforward to me that the delete key actually delete.  Does someone have a solution?  <answer80659> This would make forward delete (fn+delete) move files to trash:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add 'Move to Trash' '\U007F' /code/pre  It also makes ⌦ move files to trash when renaming files though. The same method doesn't work for delete (⌫).  You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook to change ⌫ to ⌘⌫ in Finder, but it would make renaming files and editing text even more difficult.  Even if you could change it in Finder, there would still be other places where just delete wouldn't work.  <answer238379> Try presbutan http://briankendall.net/presButan/ it should get you what you want.  <comment93043> but the delete key is really the backspace key.. so does it *really* make sense to have it delete things? <comment93044> On my keyboard, both what is equivalent to backspace and delete key on a PC are labeled delete (this is an apple keyboard). <comment93048> This is clearly a step forward, even if the drawback is quite important. Before I set this up, how can I undo it (if the drawback ends up worse than the problem) ? <comment93051> Run `defaults delete com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents` and relaunch Finder. <comment93123> Ah.  I've a macbook pro and it only has a single key labeled "delete" - but it actually performs the backspace function. <comment292899> Will try, thanks. I still don't have a solution to this day :) <comment324548> This does not work on Mac OS X El Capitan <comment324549> I can confirm that presButan works for this on Mac OS X El Capitan. It also allows to open files and folders with the enter key
