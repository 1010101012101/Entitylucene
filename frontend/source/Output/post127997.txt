Using Automator to batch crop with custom coordinates / measurements <body> I'm trying to crop large batches of images automatically.  I'm currently using Automator's Crop Images action, but it is lacking in options.  I can specify a width and height, and then it performs a centered crop.  I want to be able to specify X and Y as well as width and height (to use Xcode terms), so I can perform a consistent crop for any custom rectangle.  Are there better, more featureful cropping actions available?  Preferably for free...  :)  <answer128000> Here is a way to achieve what you want with ImageMagick. Hopefully you’re comfortable using Terminal (and also use Homebrew to manage all your packages).  Either way, you must install ImageMagick so you can run codeconvert/code command line in Terminal.  ol liOpen the folder you want to batch processing all the images. If your folder name called emimages/em is located on Desktop, you’ll need to enter codecd ~/Desktop/images//code in Terminal./li liImageMagick have a built-in option to crop images according to sizes and coordinates. The command is:  precodeconvert &lt;input documents&gt; &lt;height&gt;x&lt;width&gt;+&lt;pos x&gt;+&lt;pos y&gt; &lt;output filepath&gt; /code/pre/li /ol  hr  h2Cropping Images with ImageMagick/h2  If I want to crop all the images into:  ul liHeight: 300px/li liWidth: 500px/li liPosition X: 100px from top left/li liPosition Y: 70px from top left/li /ul  I can enter the command below:  precodeconvert *.jpg -crop 300x500+100+70 result/screenshot.jpg /code/pre  hr  Make sure the target filepath exists. In this case, you should create a folder called coderesult/code in Desktop. Or you can use absolute path like code~/Desktop/result/code or whatever folder you want to point. Just drag the folder into Terminal like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E0iVh.gif" alt="Dragging Folder into Terminal"  <comment150025> This looks like a perfect solution.  Thank you kindly! <comment374020> I tried this but it only resized one image. It took me a while to work out that the path must include a file name. I wanted the files in `./done`, so had to use result path like `./done/cropped.png` to get files `cropped-0.png`, `cropped-1.png` and so on. How can I keep the original file name? <comment374022> Oh, use `mogrify` instead of `convert`.
