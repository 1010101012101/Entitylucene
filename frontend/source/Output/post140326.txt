Accept/Maybe/Decline Missing in Apple Mail <body> I'm using Apple mail with a fresh install of MacOS and I'm missing the Accept/Maybe/Decline buttons on calendar invites. My company uses a Exchange 2013 server and some other users do see the buttons. For me, I just see an email with an attached .ics file for the same invites.  Expected behavior seen by some people.... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PIaur.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How my mail app shows it...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xNnca.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer171678> I had the same issue. After searching forever to find a solution, I stumbled on an unrelated post that fixed the issue. Apparently, if your contact in the Contacts app doesn't have the same email address that you are trying to reply to/from, then you don't get those choices.   Basically, change your contact to be "me" in the Contacts application and they show up. ContactsCardMake this my card  <answer203057> Open the Contacts app, select your own email address in the list of contacts. In the menu on top of the screen, go to "Card" - "Make this my card". Reload calendar. Then it should work, you will get a notification popup with accept/decline buttons. (I just had the same problem, on a Mac running Yosemite) Source  <comment244894> It doesn't solve your problem of the ICS file showing up I think, but when you click the file, it will import the event into the calendar, and then you will have the other problem ;)
