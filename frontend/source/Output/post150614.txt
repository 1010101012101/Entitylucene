What is a 0-size file "Icon?" in a directory? <body> I just noticed in my code~/Copy/code directory there is a file named codeIcon?/code that is 0 byte.  The file is only visible by a codels/code command.  I'm just curious what for this file exists, does anyone know about it?  <answer150615> It's just an empty file. Nothing more.   Since the code~/Copy/code is not a standard directory, it is hard to say why is it there or why it was created.  <answer150693> It's actually named "Icon\r" (you can verify this with ls in Terminal) and indicates a custom icon for the directory.  <comment177249> Then, can I ask why this file is created? <comment177250> `~/Copy` is not a standard directory, so hard to say. <comment177332> Did you have a custom icon for this directory previously? <comment177418> This folder is made by `Copy` app, so maybe that was the reason. Thanks! <comment177513> The data fork of `Icon\r` files is empty because the image data is stored in the resource fork. Run `cat Icon$'\r'/..namedfork/rsrc` or `xattr -l Icon$'\r'` to see the contents of the resource fork.
