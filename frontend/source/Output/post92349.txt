Connect old Cinema Display (24") as 2nd Display to newest iMac? <body> I'm considering buying a new 27" iMac (current model sold now).  I still have a 24" Cinema display (mini display port) that I currently have connected to an older iMac.  Now I'm wondering if this will work on the Thunderbolt socket.  <answer92357> There is no reason why it shouldn't. TB has the same connector that mini display port. So you won't even need an adapter.
