iPhone 6, iOS 10.0.2 <body> I need to set up or change the security questions for my Apple ID account. Supposedly I am to log into the account, open the Security area, and click on the Change Questions link. There is no such link. In such a case, I am supposed to contact Apple Support. I cannot do this, however, because my warranty has expired. ???  <comment320300> Go to appleid.apple.com and try logging in
