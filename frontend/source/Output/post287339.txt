Run script if there are no unread mails <body> You can trigger scripts by using rules in codeMail.app/code. So you can fire a script when receiving a mail. I'd like to also run a script if all mails are marked as read or in other words if there are no unread mails left. Is this even possible?  I know I could run a script periodically to check for unread mails but it would be enough for me to run a script once the last unread mail gets read.
