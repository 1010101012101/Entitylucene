Unhide purchases doesn't work <body> In iTunes 12.2.2.25 running on Windows 7, I see my hidden music purchases on the account page. But when I press 'unhide' button nothing happens. How can I unhide it? Can I back to old iTunes versions?  UPD. It's the iTunes bug. Call iTunesStore support to resolve the problem, it will take some minutes.  <answer202441> If the hidden purchase are on a compilation/various artists album, this is unfortunately a known bug.
