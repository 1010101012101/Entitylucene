How to insert "Right-to-Left Override" in filenames? <body> It works when I insert the RTLO character in TextEdit but when I try to rename a file, it works while the file name is still in editing but as soon as I press Enter to rename, instead of RTLO there is code?/code in the place of RTLO.  Is there a way to insert or OS simply doesn't allow it in filenames for security purposes?  Thank you!
