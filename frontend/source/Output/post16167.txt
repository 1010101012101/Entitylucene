Lost everything after iPhone sync--How can I get it back? <body> I plugged my iPhone into my computer last night and opened up iTunes.  It said I needed to sync and download the latest version. I clicked ok.  After all was done my iPhone has been set back to Decemeber.   Therefore all my photos since December are gone.  All my contacts - gone!  All my conversations on Messages and WhatsApp - gone!! This is a major issue as my iPhone is part of my work scheduling.   What has happened?  Can anyone tell me what I can do to get it back?br Also why did it do this?  <answer16185> If you've backed up recently, you might want to do a full restore, which will wipe your iPhone clean and reinstall iOS. After it's done that, it will offer to restore from a backup, reinstalling all apps, calendars, email accounts, etc. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yIkwg.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1414  <answer55198> I lost my photos during syncing, and the only way I got them back was using iSpirit. It's a nifty piece of Windows-only software for accessing iPad/iPhone as if was a data storage. I am quite sure it wouldn't have been deleted, just browse through and you'll find it. Good luck.  <comment63350> Welcome to Ask Different! Thanks for your answer! Can you please add a link to the software you mention in your answer?
