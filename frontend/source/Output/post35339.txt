How can I change my sender name in iCloud email? <body> I want to correct how my 'sender' name appears when I write mail with my iCloud account.   For some reason, iCloud shows my first name in all caps &amp; I can't edit it.  <answer35347> iCloud is linked directly to your Apple account. You should be able to edit the details on your Apple ID here: https://appleid.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MyAppleId.woa/  <answer58752> I had the same problem and changed my Apple ID to show regular text, not all caps, using the link provided in the first answer.  However, it didn't carry over to my outgoing email when I tried sending a test email from icloud.com a few minutes later.   I  found success using a different method:  ul liI logged into my account on www.icloud.com, clicked on the "gear" symbol in the top right corner of the page, selected Preferences  Accounts and changed my Full Name from ALL CAPS to Regular./li liI also made the change on the Apple Mail program where I collect my iCloud email: Mail  Preferences  Accounts  Full Name (edit it to your desired style)./li /ul  <answer60971> You may have to change it on your iphone (if you use one) as well. Go to Settings, then Mail, contacts and Calendars, then iCloud, then Account, the Advanced (at the way bottom) - there you can change the name that goes out from the iphone.   <answer85132> There is many kind of methods to do this but none of them can do in one shot for all, means change in one place (ipad, iphone, mac pc) and them forget the other, it depends from where you would send your mails you have change in that place the id information, here is the tree methods whatever device you have.

I deleted my email alias from his contact information and made sure my contact information had my name and my email alias - problem solved!  <comment40249> What do you measn by iCloud Messages? iMessages or e-mail or ... ? <comment98070> Welcome to Ask Different! Using CAPS for the description makes it kind of hard to read (and is considered to represent shouting sometimes as well). Can you please revise your answer to make it more pleasant to the eye? <comment107422> @Jackie - could you accept this if it solved your problem, please?
