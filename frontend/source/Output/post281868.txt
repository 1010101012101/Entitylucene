What Software was Bundled with My Old Mac? <body> In the beginning of 1995, we bought a Macintosh Performa 5200. I remember that after registering the machine, we got a box with some bonus software on CDs. I certainly know that The Daedalus Encounter came with it. This happened in Germany, if that matters.  What else came with this?  <answer281904> Gosh, that's a blast from the past. I had to go digging (deep) in my office!   The Performa 5200 came with a software bundle that included:  ul liThe Daedalus Encounter/li liGrolier's Multimedia Encyclopedia/li liMyst/li liMega Rock Rap 'n' Roll/li liMaking Music/li /ul  I'm not sure if there was a difference with models sold in Germany (in fact I didn't think this particular model was ever sold in Germany).  However, other models in the Performa range of that era also came with the Apple Magic Collection. This included:  ul liA Lion King animated story book/li liThe Aladin Activity Center/li liToy Story demo CD/li /ul  <answer286340> We had a Performa 6300 at that time. In addition to the software already mentioned, it also came with a Notation Software to write music with. I forgot the name though.  <comment354864> Yes, I also remember Myst. So, this sounds good! Thanks! <comment354865> No worries. As an aside, I loved playing Myst. I still have the original box (CD and all). I might just have to start playing it again on one of my old Macs! :) <comment354867> While I don't have any citable source, I'm pretty sure it was sold in Germany. It had 32+8 RAM configuration and a PAL TV receiver. <comment354868> Feel free to add more appropriate tags to the question. I didn't find one.
