How to hide files found in spotlight? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I8N81.png" alt="enter image description here"  I want to hide strongTOP HIT/strong, strongFOLDERS/strong and strongDEVELOPER/strong catalogues. The only item I expect is strongDEFINITION/strong. Is there any way to do this?

Now you are able to see and hide the DEVELOPER catalogue in strongSystem Preferences/strong - strongSpotlight/strong.
