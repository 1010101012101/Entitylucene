Make a copy of the the log file. Clean the port then attempt to install the application again. File a bug report if the installation fails.  <comment231187> Do as the error message says. What does the log say? <comment231196> How do i pull the log file? <comment231224> The file given is just a text file so use your usual viewer/editor <comment231336> Added the log file results <comment231337> That looks like a bug to me - libsoup should depend on python. Report to the macports trac <comment231341> I just completed the bug report!
