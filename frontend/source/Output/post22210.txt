BBEdit - The authenticated save for this file failed (application error code: 20004) <body> I'm trying to edit my hosts file with BBEdit 10. When I begin, it tells me to unlock the file with this message:     strongAre you sure you want to unlock "hosts"?/strong      You aren't a member of the group "wheel".   I go ahead and unlock the file but I'm not able to save it. When I try to I get this error:     The authenticated save for this file failed (application error code: 20004)   I can edit and save the file with TextEdit or Textmate, so I'm guessing that I emdo/em have the proper permissions. Why can't I save the file with BBEdit? Is it because I bought the App Store version instead of the direct download?  <answer22212> Yes, the App Store version is not able to do authenticated saves. From the Bare Bones Mac App Store FAQ     Are there any differences between the Mac App Store versions of your   software and the versions available directly from your web site?   [...]      In BBEdit and TextWrangler, authenticated saves (the ability to save   changes to files that you do not own) and the command-line tools are   not available in the Mac App Store versions, in order to comply with   Apple’s submission guidelines.   [...]      Authenticated saves will not be possible in versions of BBEdit or   TextWrangler obtained from the Mac App Store. If you desire this   capability, please purchase BBEdit directly from us or download   TextWrangler directly from us.      If you have already purchased BBEdit from the Mac App store and need   support for authenticated saves, please contact our customer service   department for assistance. We will require proof of purchase from the   Mac App Store in order to assist you; if you include that information   when you write us, doing so will speed the process.   strongUpdate:/strong As of version 10.1.1 there is a script that BareBones has provided to allow users of the Mac App Store version to enable this feature. More information is available on this Auth Saves Support Page.   <answer45315> I emailed Bare Bones's support about a related issue, and they sent me a link to a support page, which provides a workaround for the MAS limitation. They provide a script you can download into BBEdit's codeApplication Support/code directory, which adds the feature back. No need to abandon the MAS after all!  <answer87411> The link to the script which fixes the issue is here:  http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/auth-saves.html  And as Rafael said, restarting BBEdit is necessary, despite the wording on barebones's site.  <answer126843> You can sort of get around this, though it's clumsy.  ul liOpen the file in TextWrangler, then also in TextEdit. Use text edit to make a duplicate with any filename./li liDo your changes in TextWrangler as usual. It won't let you save, so Copy the whole file, and Paste it as a complete replacement of the duplicate you made in TextEdit./li liSave the duplicate. This is the finished file./li liGo into finder and manually change the filenames to replace the old one with a new one of the exact same file name./li /ul  <comment24590> Ugh. Thanks for finding that. Now I gotta go contact Barebones.. <comment24633> Yep. App Store apps live inside a sandbox that prevents certain types of system access, is why. It allows them to be vetted by Apple in certain ways, and to be installed, updated, and removed atomically in a way that a self-installed app that has full user rights might not. <comment24801> For others who have the same problem, I contacted Barebones Support and they gave me a license for the regular version with no problems <comment51678> +1 this workaround is *extremely* useful. <comment69841> The documentation says you don’t need to restart BBEdit, but I **had to** do it with version 10.1.2. <comment123225> The script mentioned above for BBEdit works perfectly for TextWrangler as well
