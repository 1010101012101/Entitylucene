Tweaking OS X 10.10 Yosemite to auto-toggle Reduced Transparency when on battery <body> I am curious about whether there is a way in OS X to hook to some events to find out whether the laptop is plugged into power. (And furthermore how we can control the "Reduced Transparency" settings option via script)  What I have come to realize over the past month of using Yosemite, is that while the transparency effect is visually pleasing, there is a real-world battery life impact that it leaves. In particular even though a wide blur can be done rapidly on the GPU and the experience is smooth enough to switch on in a great many apps, it is quite plain to see using Activity Monitor that there is a very tangible increase in CPU percentage consumed by WindowServer whenever the dynamic transparency is switched on. When I'm typing up a message the computer should not be doing anything extra that it does not need to do (such as re-render the blurred layer bits on the UI chrome when the page is not scrolling).   With it switched off I see just under 3% used by WindowServer, but it hovers around 8% with the transparency enabled. Granted it is not a huge difference, but these differences add up when running off the last few drops of juice.   So I just figure it would be nice if we could automate flipping this switch with plugging in the power. The additional resources consumed by the transparency is indeed marginally negligible, but nevertheless, I want it off while on battery.
