Count checked cells if cell on same row matches state in Numbers <body> Following on from my previous question, I also record which entry records a competition. These are currently recorded as checkboxes. Counting them all is easy enough; I simply use the following function:   precode=COUNTIF(Stevne?;TRUE) /code/pre  However, I also want to count the competitions that are specific to a type of firearm.  What I've got so far is:   precode=COUNTIF(Stevne?;TRUE;AND(Type:"Pistol")) /code/pre  That, unfortunately, returns a Syntax error, and I can't understand why.  <answer204638> You need the codeCOUNTIFS()/code function.  So in this case:  code=COUNTIFS («gun range», true, «Firearm», "Pistol")/code  Accounting for code;/code delimiters:  code=COUNTIFS («gun range»; true; «Firearm»; "Pistol")/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nr3z7.png" alt="COUNTIFS function"  From the help:     The strongCOUNTIFS/strong function returns the number of cells in one or more   collections that satisfy given conditions (one condition per   collection).      codeCOUNTIFS(test-values, condition, test-values…, condition…)/code      emtest-values/em: A collection containing values to be tested. test-values can contain any value.      emcondition/em: An expression that can include comparison operators, constants, the ampersand concatenation operator, and references. The   contents of the condition must be such that the result of comparing   the condition to another value results in the boolean value of TRUE or   FALSE.      emtest-values…/em: Optionally include one or more additional collections containing values to be tested. Each test-values collection must be   followed immediately by a condition expression. This pattern of   test-values, condition can be repeated as many times as needed.      emcondition…/em: If an optional collection of test-values is included, an additional expression that results in a boolean TRUE or FALSE. There   must be one condition expression following each test-values   collection; therefore, this function will always have an odd number of   arguments.      emNotes/em      Each value in test-values is compared to the corresponding condition.   If the corresponding values in each collection meet the corresponding   conditional tests, the count is increased by 1.   <comment246709> On a hunch, I tried this, still no luck, though: =COUNTIF(Stevne?;TRUE);AND(Type:"Pistol") <comment246715> That got me close enough; the commas needed to be semicolons, else it returned another syntax error. Changed that, and it now works perfectly <comment246716> Sorry, I didn't realize you had different delimiters.  This is for US version.  Glad it worked!  Of course you can use as many conditions as you want, get creative!  Cheers! <comment246719> No worries; as I said you got me very close, and all I needed to do was fix the delimiters.
