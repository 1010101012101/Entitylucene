Getting keystrokes on VLC via AppleScript <body> I have an AppleScript file which works like a charm, except for the part where I use keystrokes to make VLC run fullscreen. The filename has been changed for privacy reasons, but the rest of the code is the exact same. My code goes as this:  precodetell application "Finder"     set MyFile to ((path to me as text) &amp; "File.mkv") as text end tell tell application "VLC"     open MyFile end tell tell application "System Events"     tell application process "VLC"         set frontmost to true         keystroke "f" using command down     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer284362> You don't need to tell VLC to perform the keystroke.  precodetell application "VLC"     open MyFile     activate end tell tell application "System Events"     keystroke "f" using command down end tell /code/pre  hr  I understand you say the rest of the script works, but without more information, I don't see how.  codepath to me/code will return the path to the actual script, not the containing folder. This means you'll end up with the equivalent of codepath:to:script.scptFile.mkv/code, which can't be true. Instead, you need to get the container:  precodetell application "Finder"     set MyFile to ((container of (path to me) as text) &amp; "File.mkv") as text end tell /code/pre  This will return codepath:to:File.mkv/code. Make sure your mkv is actually in this location.  hr  Full script:  precodetell application "Finder"     set MyFile to ((container of (path to me) as text) &amp; "File.mkv") as text end tell tell application "VLC"     open MyFile     activate end tell tell application "System Events"     keystroke "f" using command down end tell /code/pre  <comment358589> How is the AppleScript _code_ being executed? Is it saved as an .app and the target `MyFile` placed within the _root_ of the _application bundle_?  I'm asking because, I don't see how your first `tell` _block_ could return a properly formed _pathname_ to the target file otherwise. <comment358599> sorry, not all the code got copied... it actually was "set MyFile to ((path to me as text) & "Contents:Resources:File.mkv") as text... I'm going to test your script and see how it goes. *edit* Nice, it worked... thanks!
