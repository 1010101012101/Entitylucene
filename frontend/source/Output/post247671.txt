XCode 7 on 10.10.3 <body> I've got a MacBook Pro with 10.10.3 on it. For reasons beyond my control I am unable to update to anything above 10.10.3 (critical software needed for work broken on 10.10.4 and above, dev doesn't seem to be interested in fixing it).  I would like to be able to install XCode 7 (need iOS 9 SDK) on that machine. What is the most recent version of XC7 that works on 10.10.3?  <answer247675> You can't run Xcode 7 on that version of OS X.  The minimum system requirement, according to Apple is 10.10.4.     Xcode 7 requires a Mac running OS X version 10.10.4 or later.   <comment305619> Ok thanks anyways. <comment305621> If this answers your question, be sure to accept it; that will help others who might have a similar question.
