Finder doesn't remember settings <body> In my "Documents" folder I want files with same extension to be one after another. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VcEKQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  So I open view settings options and select "Sort By: Kind", then click "Use as Defaults": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S9b5h.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I switch the folder to "Downloads" then back to "Documents" -- my sorting is lost -- the file list is sorted by name not by kind.  Did I use correctly "Use as Defaults"? Or is it a bug?  <answer281047> It turns out that if I use "Sort By: Kind", it works only if column "Kind" is shown.  Looks like a bug to me, because it allows me to sort initially, but doesn't after showing this folder again.
