Is there a way to disable incremental search search on a Mac, especially in Preview? <body> Sometimes when typing a search term in the search bar in Preview or Spotlight the text entry locks up for a few seconds. I assume this happens because it is beginning to search on the letters I've already typed to return a fast result. The problem is if I mistype my search, which happens often, I now have to wait for it to catch up on the incorrect search just so I can correct my text.   Is there a way, even involving Terminal hacking, to turn off the automatic searching as you type functionality in Preview, and maybe across the whole OS so that when I hit enter it sends the search and not before?  <answer228999> No - spotlight has live searches hard coded into the app.  You have two options:  ol liWork on tuning the system so it's less busy and that the disk IO needed to look up things from the spotlight database are faster./li liPaste the entire search string into the search field to avoid incremental updates./li /ol
