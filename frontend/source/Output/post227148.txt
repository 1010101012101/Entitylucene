Finder's incorrect PDF Filesize <body> A few PDF files are showing with the incorrect filesize and I was wondering if there is any way to fix this.  E.g. opening a PDF file's properties is showing that the file is 394 KB, if I attach the file to an email or upload it by FTP somewhere else I get the file's real size which is 289 KB  This behaviour seems to be happening with any PDF file on my computer. Is there a setting that can be changed or something to fix this?  This is happening for me on El Capitan 10.11.3  <answer227523> This is typically caused by resource forks that are local and don't get sent with the file in the email. You can view these and their sizes using ls in Terminal using:  precodels -lah@ &lt;filename&gt; /code/pre  or just leave filename blank to display this for the contents of the current directory.
