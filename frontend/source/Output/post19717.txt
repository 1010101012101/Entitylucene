Can I use iBooks on my MacBook Pro <body> I'd love to be able to use iBooks on my laptop. Is that possible? Maybe if I install Lion?  <answer19719> No, it's an iOS application.  It will not run on OS X.  To read DRM-free e-books on your Mac, there are 3rd party Apps like Calibre. But even they can't read the DRM-encrypted books from the iBooks store.  <comment31868> I agree.  A lot of people are hoping for an OS X version of iBooks. I wouldn't be surprised if it appeared at some point.
