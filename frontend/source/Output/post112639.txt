How to install firefox using the terminal app <body> I am trying to install Mozila Firefox on the school's server via ssh. Given that I have authorization to install it on the server, could someone guide me through the steps to install firefox?   It has to be done through the Terminal, from my remote laptop using ssh instead of the graphical log in.  <answer112644> I am assuming that you already have a connection via Terminal to the school server.  You need to download the .dmg first. Goto the directory in which you want to download the dmg file (command codecd \PATH\TO\DIR/code)  Then enter this into the terminal:  precodecurl http://mozilla.mirrors.tds.net/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/latest/mac/en-US/Firefox%2025.0.1.dmg -o firefox25.dmg /code/pre  This is the latest Firefox Release for OS X.  Then mount the dmg:  precodehdiutil attach firefox25.dmg /code/pre  Goto the mounted dmg (probably under Volumes):  precodecd /Volumes/Firefox /code/pre  There you can find the codeFirefox.app/code which you can now copy to your Applications folder:  precodecp Firefox.app /Applications/Firefox.app /code/pre  To unmount the dmg:  precodehdiutil detach /Volumes/Firefox /code/pre
