launchagent logs warning/error into console <body> I have a launch agent that I created several years ago to set a random signature both in a .signature and in Mail.app. It does nothing complicated and has hummed along through several OS X versions. However, I see that recently every time it runs there is an error logged into the console:  precode12/07/15 08:52:36.903 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (local.home.randsig[97440]) Service exited with abnormal code: 1 /code/pre  The script is not at all complicated, and it runs out of my home folder (#HOME/bin/randsig), but I suspect I am running into a sandboxing issue.  precode#!/bin/bash SIGHOME="$HOME/.signature" $HOME/bin/fortune $HOME/mysigs &gt; $SIGHOME  MAIL=`ps -U"$USER" -co command | grep "\bMail\b"`  if [ "$MAIL" ]; then  cat $SIGHOME | sed -e 's/"/\\"/g' &gt; $HOME/.mail_signature  MYSIG="$(&lt;$HOME/.mail_signature)"  osascript &lt;&lt;EOF       tell application "Mail" to set content of signature "Fortune" to "-- " &amp; return &amp; "$MYSIG" EOF fi /code/pre  The error doesn't prevent the script from running, but since it runs every 12 seconds, the errors do make looking for other things in console more of a problem.  I did see this discussion, but in my case it doesn't help me.  <comment233555> Do you really need to run this script 300 times an hour and 7200 times a day? If you slow it down then I would try adding `wait` and `exit 0` at the end of the script. <comment233645> yes, I do. It changes the signature often enough that successive messages always have different signatures and often enough that if I onâ€™t like the current signature I can easily refresh for a new one without waiting too long.
