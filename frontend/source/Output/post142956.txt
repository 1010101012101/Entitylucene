Bind Secondary Groups to Active Directory w/ Unix Extensions <body> I'm running Windows Server 2012 R2 w/ Active Directory and Unix Extensions. I have several linux/bsd hosts already connected to the domain via ldap and mapping the uid/gid/secondary groups properly.  I'm running a few mac's on 10.9 and 10.10 beta, I'm trying to figure out if its possible to map secondary Group IDs to the AD UnixGID and not the GID that AD creates..  for example, if i run codeid mikedevita/code on a linux box it gives me this:  precode% id mikedevita                                                                                                                                                          uid=40001(mikedevita) gid=30000(Domain Users) groups=30001(Domain   Admins),30002(VMWareAdmins) ,30003(VPNUsers),30004(LinuxUsers),30005(media),30006(LinuxAdmins),30000(Domain Users) /code/pre  if i run the same command, codeid mikedevita/code on my mac it gives this:   precodebase% id mikedevita uid=40001(mikedevita) gid=30000 groups=30000,701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.2),519395259(DEVITA\media),693256891(DEVITA\MacAdmins),703(com.apple.sharepoint.group.4),501(access_bpf),599473300(DEVITA\VPNUsers),613468898(DEVITA\VMWareAdmins),12(everyone),62(netaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),1446817776(DEVITA\Domain Admins),401(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),1873589173(DEVITA\RouterAdmins),416683223(DEVITA\Denied RODC Password Replication Group),206(com.apple.access_loginwindow),702(com.apple.sharepoint.group.3),33(_appstore),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer),398(com.apple.access_screensharing),399(com.apple.access_ssh) /code/pre  as you can see, the uid, and gid fields are mapped properly (40001, 30000) but all of the domain level groups which the user belongs to as secondary groups don't use the right group ID.  Is there a way to remap this?  <answer142991> It sounds like you have the user records' gid attribute mapped, but not the group records' gid. You can check this from the command line with codedsconfigad/code:  precode$ sudo dsconfigad -show [...] Advanced Options - Mappings   Mapping UID to attribute       = uidNumber   Mapping user GID to attribute  = gidNumber   Mapping group GID to attribute = gidNumber   Generate Kerberos authority    = Enabled [...] /code/pre  Note the "Mapping group GID to attribute = gidNumber" -- that's what I think you're missing. You can set it from the command line with codesudo dsconfigad -ggid gidNumber/code, on with the GUI program /System/Library/CoreServices/Directory Utility.app (click the padlock to authenticate as admin, double-click the Active Directory connector, click the triangle to "Show Advanced Options", click the Mappings tab, then enable "Map group HID to attribute" and set it to "gidNumber").  <comment168526> that was it! Thank you Gordon. <comment174562> Does the Mapping change the UID and GID locally to match the one in AD? <comment174564> @Johnny: I'm not exactly sure what you mean. For AD accounts, the Mac *always* uses UIDs and GIDs based on the AD account attributes. If mapping is enabled, it uses the selected AD attributes (generally `uidNumber` and `gidNumber`). If mapping is not enabled, it uses IDs generated from the accounts' UUID. There's never really a "local" ID.
