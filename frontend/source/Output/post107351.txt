Automatically disabling the passcode when iPhone connected to home wifi <body> Is this possibile? I have found an app for jailbroken iphones, is there something for non-jailbroken ones?  <answer107356> No, this is not possible on a non-jailbroken device. Due to sandboxing and other restrictions, it is not possible for an app on a non-jailbroken device to have control over a system-level passcode.  <comment125938> Thanks. Anything you can suggest to alleviate the problem? <comment125952> I would like to have a password for all the apps that can potentially contain private data, basically: messages, whatsup, facebook, notes, skypes and mail.
