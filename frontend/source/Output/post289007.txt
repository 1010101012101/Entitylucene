Not Mac language used when using Apple Configurator <body> While trying to get a few things automated for iPhone setup with Apple Configurator 2 I wanted to get rid of the language and region selection screen. The help states that those settings will then default to the settings of the Mac used to prepare the device:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/icfl9.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the help"  full help article  On the Mac I am using the language and region both are German(y) however if skipping the configurations steps in the iPhone setup it ends up in English.  It appears that other people had this problem before but could not get any useful response.  Reference 1br Reference 2  (Neither of them is mine; I found them during research)  Is there anything I am missing, is the help incorrect?    iPhone 6 with iOS 10.3.2br MacBook Air (no further info, sorry)br Apple Configurator 2 Version 2.2
