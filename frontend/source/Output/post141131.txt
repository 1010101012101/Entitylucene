How to send a pop up message from a Mac to Windows on same network? <body> I want to use the equivalent of codenet send/code, but from a MacBook. I want to send a pop up message from my mac to a windows machine on same network. Is smbutil the command to use?  <answer141132> Run the following command, then enter your message and press ⌃D to finish and send.  precodesmbclient -M NETBIOSNAME -U FROMNAME /code/pre  supcode-U FROMNAME/code is optional/sup  <answer242397> Maybe for others who find the question:  But it's no pop up! It's more like a chat.  One machine has to be the Server:  precodenc -v -l 12345 /code/pre  code-v/code: verbose (more information about execution of the command)  code12345/code: any port of your choice higher than 1024  All other machines can be client(s):  precodenc -v [ip of server] 12345 /code/pre  code-v/code: look above  code[ip of server]/code to find out ip: ìfconfig | grep inet`(probably one of the 192.168.xxx.xxx or maybe even 172.xxx.xxx.xxx numbers)  code12345/code: again the chosen port of the server  Hope that helps!  <comment166312> Thanks for the quick reply, I forgot to mention the version, 10.9.4, and smbclient is no longer available...
