Is the iPhone 4 antenna problem fixed in the iPhone 4S <body> Is the iPhone 4 antenna problem fixed in the iPhone 4S?  Was it secretly fixed for all new models or just the iPhone 4S or none?  <answer52056> I think so. Since Apple placed an extra antenna (now they are two) in the iPhone and they redesigned the whole antenna system (an extra receiver in the frame inter alia).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/afbru.png" alt="enter image description here"  And according to the movies in this blogpost, it seems like the new system did fix the so-called antennagate! They compared the iPhone 4S reception with an iPhone 4 which is suffering from the antennagate.  According to Apple itself, the system...     Intelligently switches between two antennas to transmit and receive   <comment59520> lol I love how Apple just kinda of makes this huge bug fix a feature! <comment59523> My Verizon iPhone 4 (MD146LL) has the 2nd antenna. <comment59524> Is "the problem" that people don't understand that there isn't a problem? As far as I can tell, iPhone 4 continue to be made, sold and used with the antenna design as originally launched. Am I misinformed? <comment59535> @bmike, I agree. I don't know of any people that use their phone without a case or bumper guard - these folks wouldn't be affected by this "problem" at all. <comment59578> Did you experience an actual problem or are you referring to the PR incident? :)
