How can I prevent the iCloud dialog from showing up for new users? <body> On 10.7.2, whenever a new account is created, and the person logs in for the first time, they see the iCloud system pref pane.  Is there a way to prevent this from showing up?  <answer28736> From a codeTerminal/code window:     codesudo defaults write /System/Library/User\Template/Non_localized/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SetupAssistant DidSeeCloudSetup -bool TRUE/code   Source  <comment33511> I think that needs a slash in front of System:     defaults write /System/Library (etc)
