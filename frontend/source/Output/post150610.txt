How to prevent all usb mass storages from mounting at boot <body> On a codeMac Lion 10.7.5 I/code have 5 USB external disk and I'm not using them all the time so I want to prevent it to mount at boot and only mount the one I need when needed.  How can I achieve this ?  Thank you  <answer150616> It depends on how you clarify 'mount at boot'. Do you mean the user login or the actual system boot...  Anyway, here are two ways you can handle this.  ol liYou can use one of the Startup shortcuts. In your case holding kbd‚èè/kbd during startup will eject all removable disks. To be honest, I am not 100% if your external USB drives are seen as such./li liEdit your code/etc/fstab/code file, the file systems table. This table contains info on how to mount which disk. If the file does not exist, you can create it. Manual pages are here./li /ol  At this to your code/etc/fstab/code.  precode# device-spec     mount-point     fs-type     options  LABEL=VolumeName  none            hfs         noauto /code/pre  <comment177253> The "possible duplicate link" explain this quit well. It seams that's the good solution. Some of my externals hard drives are  FAT32 (vfat) to no UUID. How do I point on vfat HD in /etc/fstab ? <comment177258> That would be:` LABEL=VolumeName  none  vfat  noauto` <comment177340> Great ! thank you
