Shared network font library in macOS Sierra <body> I administer a small network of approximately ten Macs using a Mac Mini Server with Server.app 5.3.1. I have been trying to setup a network library to share our fonts among the administered Macs. Font Book should automatically recognise fonts located in the /Network/Library/Fonts folder or at least it used to. In fact, if in Snow Leopard Server enabling these kind of shared libraries used to be possible and easily doable in Workgroup Manager, now Apple seems to have dropped this feature or made it much more difficult to implement.   After some digging, I discovered that I should enable the automount of the desired network drive by editing /etc/auto_master. My server shares a share point called Fonts both via AFP and SMB. It is also accessible by guests.   And here come the questions. First of all, none of my administered Macs shows a /Network/Servers nor a /Network/Library folder, despite the fact that they are successfully bound to the Open Directory domain. On the other hand, on the server I can at least see the /Network/Servers folder, which means that this feature is still existent in Sierra. So, how do I fix this issue on my clients?   Second question: is there any difference between AFP/SMB/NFS automounts? The easier setup would be with SMB, but according to some posts (this for example) on the Internet the font library has to be mounted as a NFS share. As far as I know, Server.app doesn't allow (anymore) to share a folder via NFS, so this was necessary it's my understanding that I should rely on third-party apps, but I'd be more that happy to be proved wrong.   Update: I managed to mount the share via SMB using codemount -t smbfs //user@server.domain.com/Fonts /Network/Library/Fonts/code but only after manually creating the folders Library and the subfolder Fonts. Both of them are eliminated upon restart and Font Book doesn't recognise the fonts in there. Also, in order to mount the folder I have to use a proper OD user instead of guest.   Can anyone help me?
