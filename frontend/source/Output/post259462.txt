So how do I connect my 2016 MacBook Pro to my Display Port monitor?  <comment324616> Could you use a USB-C to DP adapter? There's also an expensive ($100) Thunderbolt 3 to dual DP adapter. <comment324618> Have a look at: [MacBook Pro Thunderbolt 3 adapter guide: How to connect an iPhone, display, hard drive, and more](http://www.macworld.com/article/3136583/macbook-accessories/macbook-pro-thunderbolt-3-adapter-guide-how-to-connect-an-iphone-display-hard-drive-and-more.html#displayport) <comment324621> @user3439894 Hmm looks like the listed adapter doesn't support 4K at 60 Hz.
