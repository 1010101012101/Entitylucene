In Numbers, how can I show a formula instead of the result? <body> I want selected cells to show the formula instead of the result of the formula, for example cells C4 and D4 here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0kIC.png" alt="Cell C4 contains &quot;=B4+1&quot; rather than the numerical result of adding 1 to the value in B4."  If the cell is formatted as text embefore/em I enter the formula, then the formula remains text.  However, selecting text format after the formula has been computed has no effect.  <answer229705> There is no easy way to do this, but the formula is shown at the bottom of the Numbers-window, so why do you want to see it in the cell itself?  <comment280401> I assigned my class a problem requiring them to build a spreadsheet, and I wanted to show my solution.  Showing the formulas in selected cells would illustrate how the numerical results were obtained.
