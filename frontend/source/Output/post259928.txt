Delete crashes reports using Terminal <body> I am trying delete the crashing reports plist using terminal (OS Sierra):  precodesudo rm -rf "~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter/*" /code/pre  But nothing happen. What I am doing bad? Thank you.  <answer259930> Tilde expansion must not be quoted nor the wildcard. The space between Application and Support would be quoted with a backslash.  precode~/Library/Application\ Support/CrashReporter/* /code/pre
