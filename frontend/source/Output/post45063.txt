No Scroll Lock on Apple Keyboard <body> My StarTech sv215micusba KVM requires that I use kbdScroll Lock/kbd, kbdScroll Lock/kbd, kbdEnter/kbd, but my Apple keyboard doesn't have a Scroll Lock key.  I found this reference:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1216  But it refers to key combinations used for Windows functionality (driver-dependent).  What combo would I need to press in order to send the correct sequence to my KVM switch?  <answer45069> Some KVM switches have alternate methods of switching besides kbdScroll Lock/kbd. I would read the manual to see if there is any similar feature on your KVM.  Otherwise, you might need to resort to having an additional PC keyboard hooked up to the KVM switch with the sole purpose of sending the kbdScroll Lock/kbd command.  <answer45102> If you have a large Apple keyboard with an kbdF14/kbd Key, Shift-kbdF14/kbd has been documented to work as a Scroll Lock key in Excel. I don't have any documentation about your sv215micusba device, but if you have a large Apple keyboard, that key combination might work.  <answer45268> Having had a look at the StarTech SV215MICUSBA manual (PDF), on page 7 it says:     To initialize Mac keyboard mapping, please execute the following   hotkey  sequence:      [scroll],[scroll], [F2], [Enter]br   orbr   [ctrl] [ctrl] [F2] [Enter]      Once this has been done, the following keyboard mapping will apply:   Then in the table below, it indicates that the KBDScroll Lock/KBD Lock key on a PC keyboard is mapped to KBDF14/KBD on a Mac keyboard.   Assuming you have a full Apple keyboard, its probably worth trying this out.  <answer93657> Use the free remap tool for macbook available at https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/index.html.en, enable functions keys in the settings of the keyboard, and remap the key you want to F14.  Example for F6 to F14: add the following xml in your private.xml file inside ~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Swap F6 to PrintScroll&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.swap_F6_to_printscroll&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__      KeyCode::F6,     KeyCode::F14     &lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment51266> Would it be worth naming the exact KVM in case anyone has any specific experience, e.g. modifying the key combination? <comment51312> Agreed, added.  Thanks.
