How can I uninstall Adobe Air on Lion? <body> I'm trying to uninstall Adobe Air on Lion.  All of my air apps won't load so I think an uninstall/reinstall will help.    I've opened the Adobe AIR uninstaller but nothing comes up.  I can't figure out how to do this.  Does anyone know how I can uninstall Adobe Air?  <answer34398> Follow these steps:  ul liOpen Finder and navigate to the following directory: HD  Library  Framework/li liDelete the following folder: Â Adobe AIR.framework/li liDownload and run Adobe Air Installer, and it should work./li /ul  This is courtesy of the this site here. Enjoy!  <answer34403> To uninstall AdobeAIR by hand, quit any unnecessary applications (specially applications that might use AdobeAIR). Then delete the following files and folders.  em/Applications/Adobe/Flash Player/AddIns/airappinstaller/em (alternatively remove the em/Applications/Adobe/em folder - first checking that its sub-folders do not contain files other than AdobeAIR files.)  em/Applications/Utilities/Adobe AIR Application Installer.app/em  em/Applications/Utilities/Adobe AIR Uninstaller.app/em  em/Library/Frameworks/Adobe AIR.framework/em  em/Users/Shared/Library/Application Support/Adobe/AIR/em (alternatively remove the em/Users/Shared/Library/em folder - first checking that its sub-folders do not contain files other than AdobeAIR files.)  The following files are in your Home Folder (represented by '~'). You can access this Library folder by holding down kbd⌥/kbd while accessing the strongFinder/strong menu strongGo  Library/strong.  em~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/AIR/em (alternatively remove the em~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/em folder - first checking that its sub-folders do not contain files other than AdobeAIR files.)  em~/Library/Caches/com.adobe.air.ApplicationInstaller/em  em~/Library/Caches/com.adobe.air.Installer/em  em~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.air.ApplicationInstaller.plist/em  em~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.air.ApplicationInstaller.plist.lockfile/em  em~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#Security/FlashPlayerTrust/air.1.0.trust.cfg/em  em~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/www.macromedia.com/bin/airappinstaller/em  These files were found by scanning the file system before and after installing the latest version of AdobeAIR to see the file changes that were made.  <answer34408> I can't test it right now, but I'll as soon as I get back home on my Mac. So, it's just a wild guess...   Download it again and install the freshly downloaded package. It will either ask you to overwrite your previous installed package or offer you a way to uninstall the previous versions.    <comment39261> Was it installed under Lion, or under a previous OS that was subsequently upgraded? <comment39272> I would try a reinstall first: http://get.adobe.com/air/ If that doesn't fix it outright, then see if you can uninstall it. If anything, a reinstallation should let you subsequently uninstall. Then reboot and reinstall again.
