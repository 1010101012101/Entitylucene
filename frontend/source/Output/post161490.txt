How can I remove the eject button from my menubar when cmd-drag won't work? <body> I have an eject icon in my menubar that I cannot remove by command-dragging it out of the bar. Is there a command I can run in Terminal?  <answer161700> I have realized what the problem was  If you use Bartender.app, if the app is active, you cannot drag items out of the menubar. You need to quit Bartender first  <comment188725> in the actual top menu bar, or do you mean in the Finder window toolbar? [picture would help, if you can't post it directly to your question link it to imgur, flikr etc & someone can inline it for you] The first would have to be some app putting it there, the second is just View menu Customise toolbar, drag it out. <comment188726> Duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40302/how-can-i-remove-the-eject-icon-from-the-menubar <comment188917> Kent: This is not a duplicate. I literally cannot drag the object out of my menu bar, which that ticket does not address. Tetsujin: I mean the top menu bar or system tray or whatever you want to call it. Cmd-drag doesn't work. I can remove other objects no problem. <comment188923> Could you explain a bit more so that the answer would be useful to others who get into this state <comment188977> Yes. If you use Bartender.app, if the app is active, you cannot drag items out of the menubar. You need to quit Bartender first.
