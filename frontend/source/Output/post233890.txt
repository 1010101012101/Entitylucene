Calling Python 3 script from AppleScript <body> I have a Python 3 script that I'd like to add as a Service using Automator. The idea is that I can right click on a text file, and an option will display to run my script on said file.  The shebang for my Python script is as follows:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python3 /code/pre  This script works fine and as expected in Terminal. However, when I attempt to automate this with AppleScript/Automator like so:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "Terminal"     do shell script "/path/to/script.py $@" end tell  return input end run /code/pre  I run into issues, namely:  precodeTerminal got an error: env: python3: No such file or directory /code/pre  I've read here, among other places, that AppleScript by design only allows access to Unix commands, and will not for example source your bash profile (thus we do not have access to our $PATH by default). However I was under the impression that providing explicit paths was a workaround.  I've tried changing the codedo shell/code to this:  precodedo shell script "/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py $@" /code/pre  and I've tried changing the shebang to this:  precode#!/usr/bin/env /usr/bin/python3 /code/pre  But nothing seems to work. Is it simply just not possible to execute a Python 3 script via AppleScript? I've not been able to find a viable workaround in my searches.  strongEdit:/strong Additional info:  precode$ type -a python3 python3 is /usr/local/bin/python3 /code/pre  <answer233908> Solved my problem by changing the codedo shell/code to:  precodedo shell script "/usr/local/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py $@" /code/pre  and letting the shebang stay as:  precode#!/usr/bin/env python3 /code/pre  <comment285824> Start the Terminal application and type the following into your shell : `type -a python3` then edit your post with the command and the results. <comment285826> Done. Since it looks like that's a different path, I wonder if I can symlink `/usr/bin/python3` to `/usr/local/bin/python3` or vice versa to avoid this issue across the environment. <comment285843> Why do you expect do shell script "/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py $@" to work? Your python3 is in /usr/local/bin What happens if you use the correct path? <comment285862> Touche. I got confused, the path on my Linux server is `/usr/bin/python3` so I used that without checking.
