How to schedule run of .command file (bash)? <body> I have a bash script (saved as codemyfilename.command/code) and would like to schedule its run. I've tried to use Calendar event for this (which works fine with Automator scripts), but I get the following error -      “myfilename.command” can’t be opened because CoreServicesUIAgent is   not allowed to open documents in Terminal.   Is there any way to fix it?  <answer180007> There are several ways and I think the first step is to make the .command file just a shell script.  Given you comment re automator I would suggest the easiest way is to create an automator/applescript that calls this shell script. This then can be called by calendar  Other ways are using non GUI tools and call the shell script from a cron or launchd entry   <comment213623> What does "... but not launchd does not work in Yosemite" mean here? <comment213757> An extra negation + see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155833/launchd-startcalendarinterval-not-working-reliably
