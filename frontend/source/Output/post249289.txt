How to clear display settings cache <body> How do I clear the "cache" (remembered settings such as whether to mirror or have two separate displays or what my preferred resolution is for a monitor)?  <comment309204> Why? This seems awfully specific and there might be a better way to accomplish what you're trying to do <comment309208> On a Mac mini, the display that I have has crapped out. Weirdly enough, it works at some resolutions and not others. It does work at its native resolution, which wasn't what I had it set at. My friend is letting me borrow a monitor temporarily to control the machine. So I figure if I can wipe out the configuration cache, and plug my monitor back in, I can use it at its native resolution. <comment309209> Interesting issue. I'll do some more research, but if nothing else, [SwitchResX](http://www.madrau.com/) might be able to help, as I believe what displays you've connected over time are remembered. <comment309210> You can also try [clearing NVRAM.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063)
