How to replace wifi password? <body> I have saved the wifi password for our network on an iPhone 5c.  In the meantime the wifi username and password has changed.  So what I had tried so far:  ol liGo to Settings - Wifi/li liChoose the wifi network's "i" icon/li liChoose "Forget This Network"/li liChoose "Forget"/li liBack to the wifi settings/li liSelect the wifi network's "i" icon again/li liSelect "Join Network"/li liSafari opens and ask for a user name and password/li liEnter the user name and password/li liChoose Done/li /ol  Next time when I join the network again, on my on-screen keyboard, I go to "Passwords".  The only options I see is the OLD username and password so that the new one that I just had entered is missing.  How can I replace the OLD wifi username and password so that I do not have to enter it manually again?  <answer257845> Go to Settings - Safari - General, Authorise yourself and try to update your password there.  <comment322127> Do you have 'Ask to Join Networks' setting turned ON? If you turn it OFF then known networks will be joined automatically and if you have wrong password, then it will ask for correct one and save it. <comment322140> @ranklord I see an "Auto-Join" and a "Auto-Login" option. Which one are referring to? I'm on iOS 9.3.5 <comment322141> About [this](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202639) <comment322147> @ranklord Thanks, but my old password still shows instead of the new one. <comment322148> It seems like "Forget this network" only forget the network, not the password. <comment322150> Looks like I've missed one key point. Go to Settings - Safari - General, Authorise yourself and try to update your password there. <comment322151> @Koning I'm very sure that's not intended behaviour as I have used forget network to do that kind of stuff many times <comment322152> @ranklord Sorry I only saw your comment after I posted the solution. Please post it as an answer and I will select it as the correct answer. <comment322154> @Koning, glad we've managed to solve your problem! :)))
