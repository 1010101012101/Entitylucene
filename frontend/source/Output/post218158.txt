Macbook Pro 13 inch mid 2012 not running two daisy chained thunderbolt displays <body> I am trying to run two thunderbolt displays with my macbook pro and it will only run one at a time.  I have tried the displays with an older 17 inch model and it runs all three (including the internal screen) fine.  ul liOS X 10.11.1/li li2.5 GHz Intel Core i5/li li8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3/li liIntel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB/li /ul  <answer218671> I think it's that my laptop is on the edge of being powerful enough for both.  I made some space on my hard disk, stopped any applications from opening automatically on login and restarted whilst plugged in to both monitors.
