Cannot access iPhone files using my macbook via Bluetooth <body> I turned on bluetooth on my Macbook Air 13" (Early 2015, 8 GB RAM) and on my iPhone SE.  I'm trying to access the files from iPhone using my macbook. When trying to connect to my iPhone, it shows an error: "There was an error connecting to the device".     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QOlDl.png" alt=""   However, if I start a personal hotspot on iPhone I can successfully connect via bluetooth and get internet from my phone.  Using my macbook I can successfully connect to my old Samsung S3100 phone and browse the files via bluetooth.  Also, I can use my iPhone to connect via bluetooth to my piano and get/send midi data from/to it.  I feel like just the communication between my mac and iPhone is kinda brokenâ€”it could be the cause why AirDrop is not working too.  How to fix/debug this?  <answer243655> iPhone does not support browsing files over Bluetooth.  Edit: Apple lists three methods for transferring data between a Mac and an iPhone.  ol liAirDrop/li liHandoff/li liiCloud Drive/li /ol  On that same page, Apple lists the built-in Mac browser for Bluetooth as an option for "other Bluetooth devices" and I think it is appropriate to infer that they thereby exclude the iPhone from that capability.  <comment300094> Is there any reference for that? I just saw another similar and short answer (which is probably true), but I'd like to know why is that. <comment300097> Edited to provide further information.
