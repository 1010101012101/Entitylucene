How to change date format on menu bar without extra apps? <body> This is how it looks right now  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8215j.png" alt="This is how it looks right now"  These are my "Language &amp; Region" settings  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Guo0o.png" alt="These are my customization settings"  There is clearly a bug involved. I don't want use an app to solve such ridiculously simple prolem. It should be reading this format from somewhere right?  <answer181508> There is a specific Pref Pane for the menu bar Clock settings, separate to the Dates pref, which is for how dates are shown in Finder.br strongSystem Prefs  Date &amp; Time  Clock/strong  You can also access it directly by clicking the menu bar Clock, or typing "date" into Prefs search  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYbkn.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1r9mD.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQ23U.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer182435> I don't know whether you ever got the above method to work, but it never did the trick for me. However, I seem to have found a way that works without resorting to a 3rd party app. I was pulling my hair out about this because I wanted to have a '.' as the time separator, and even when using the codedefaults/code command like so:  precodedefaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "DateFormat" "EEE MMM d  H.mm" /code/pre  It would successfully assign the value, but every time I killed the menu bar, it would inexplicably revert to the default format. I'm not sure how permanent this will be, but I did a quick loop in bash and after running it for a few seconds, I killed the menu bar from a separate shell, and then returned to the loop and killed it - voil√†!  So, basically from shell 1:  precodewhile true;      &gt; do;     &gt; defaults write com.apple.menuextra.clock "DateFormat" "EEE MMM d  H.mm";     &gt; done; /code/pre  ...then in another shell:  precodekillall -KILL SystemUIServer /code/pre  And then return to the first shell and kill the loop. I haven't restarted yet, but so far the change has stuck. HTH!  <comment215902> I actually want to put MY preffered format. These options are not enough. No year, no way to show month as number, etc.. This should be a pretty trivial task with terminal. I just don't know where to look. <comment216013> Then you should ask that question separately. My answer simply points out that you were setting the wrong pref for the menu bar clock. <comment218048> Thank you! I wrote a little sh script to set my format, works like a charm. This is probably not gonna last, but it's something. <comment218056> Here is the script: http://pastie.org/10119105 Can be killed with CTRL+C after you see your format on menu. <comment218090> Right on! Glad it helped...this one was vexing me for quite some time. I can't get it to persist across reboots. Sometime, if I am motivated, I guess I can use init or launchd to set it every time it boots... <comment228498> Doesn't work for me, on OS X Yosemite. Running scripts/commands in that order removes the date from the menu bar, but then it comes back in the same old format. They break this stinking feature every stinking operating system update. <comment243475> I am on Yosemite now, just run the script twice and wait for clock to come back before pressing ctrl + c. Not the best solution but works. <comment314018> What an amazing language calls a day of the week `Pazartesi`? I like it. Oh, Turkish. Cool. <comment350653> I recall this has worked for me in the past, but it's not working on a new macOS Sierra machine for me today.
