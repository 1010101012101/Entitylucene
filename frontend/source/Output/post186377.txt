Make spotlight open new instance of application instead of going to application <body> I recently moved from Windows to OSX, and find it frustrating that typing codeChrome/code, codeSublime Text/code or codeTerminal/code in Spotlight do not allow me to open a new window, but instead takes me to an open window of the application.  There's the option of running codeopen -n "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/"/code from terminal but, that defeats the purpose of Spotlight. I'm also aware of Alfred, which is not a solution for me.  Is it possible to change the behaviour of Spotlight to suit this?  <answer186380> Found a solution using flashlight, which allows you to create custom search terms for spotlight.  ol liInstall Flashlight/li liEnter the Flashlight app/li liClick codeNew Plugin/code  codeRun an Automator Workflow/code/li liEdit contents according to needs - mine is: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/haA4m.png" alt="Edit Flashlight plugin"/li liClick codeEdit Workflow/code/li liRemove notification and add codeRun shell script/code/li liAdd command that fits needs - mine is: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9AdTj.png" alt="Edit automator workflow"/li liTest your command works by clicking codeRun/code in the codeAutomator/code window./li liClose codeAutomator/code and the window for the new plugin in Flashlight/li liSearching for any of the keywords in codeUsage examples/code input to the Flashlight plugin will allow you to run the script./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nFh8.png" alt="Spotlight search term"  <comment219992> It's not really the behaviour of Spotlight you're trying to change, it's the behaviour of OS X itself. Sending 'open' to a running Mac app is always interpreted as 'bring to front'. <comment219994> I'm not sure I agree - clicking on an app in the dock should not start a new instance, but rather show the running app. <comment219995> I'm sure that's what I said - it will bring an already-running app to the front. Adding the -n flag is what changes the behaviour. +1s for Q & solution, though.
