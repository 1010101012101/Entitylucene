Customise Touch Bar in Microsoft Office 2016 <body> The February 2017 updates for Microsoft Office 2016 include Touch Bar support on the new MacBook Pros. But the defaults aren't very usable, and I can't find an option to customise the Touch Bar layout as is found on other apps with TouchBar support. Is there any way to customise the Touch Bar in Office 2016?  <answer273420> There is not an option at this point in time.  As an office insider, I recently sent a feature  request to them. If you'd like to send a feature request, just click the :) in the top right corner and go from there.
