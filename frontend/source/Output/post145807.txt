Need to burn FAT32 CD from Snow Leopard <body> Please tell me how to burn a FAT32 CD under Snow Leopard (10.6.8).  I have tried multiple approaches, including creating a FAT32 .dmg properly sized for the disc, and burning from the Finder or from Disk Utility.  The thread at How to burn Windows compatible CD on Mac OS X Mountain Lion did not help me.  The image correctly shows up as type FAT32 in Disk Utility, but the resulting disc invariably shows up as type Mac OS Extended.  I am trying to do this because some Windows users are reporting not seeing anything on the disc I sent them.  It was my understanding that the Mac automatically creates CDs that can be read by both OS X and Windows.  <answer145865> You cannot make a FAT32 CD. Windows does not use that format for CD/DVDs.  Normally, when burning a bunch of files, both Mac and Windows use codeISO 9660 (Joliet)/code for CDs and codeUniversal Disk Format (UDF)/code for DVD media. Format is automatically chosen once media is detected.  Also there is no need to make an image first. You just  ul liselect the files in Finder/li liright click on the selected files/li liselect Burn./li /ul  <comment171828> How does the thread not help you? <comment171874> Mark, I tried what the thread says to do but I still end up with type Mac OS Extended. <comment172134> It appears that Disk Utility reports CDs as format Mac OS Extended no matter how or where they were burned.  I find that rather confusing. <comment172174> It doesn't on my 10.6.8 - It clearly says `Format: ISO 9960`. Something is seriously messed up on your system!
