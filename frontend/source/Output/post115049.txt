Automount'ed Samba Shares accessible via Command Line but hidden in Finder? <body> I have 4 samba shares on a Synology DiskStation that I successsfully automount on my 10.9 / Mavericks based system under /Shares/ and when I open the command line I can go there just fine and list the files and directories just fine, however when trying to navigate to /Shares via the Mac OS X finder, the directory just seems entirely empty:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uxLL6.png" alt="Screenshot"  My /etc/auto_master looks like this:  precode# # Automounter master map # +auto_master        # Use directory service /net            -hosts      -nobrowse,hidefromfinder,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,hidefromfinder /Network/Servers    -fstab /-          -static /Shares         auto_smb    -nosuid /code/pre  ... my /etc/auto_smb like this:  precodehome -fstype=smbfs,rw,soft ://joerg:myPassword@nasHostname/home Downloads -fstype=smbfs,rw,soft ://joerg:myPassword@nasHostname/Downloads Music -fstype=smbfs,rw,soft ://joerg:myPassword@nasHostname/Music Videos -fstype=smbfs,rw,soft ://joerg:myPassword@nasHostname/Videos /code/pre  What am I missing here? Why aren't the shares displayed in Finder?  <answer115051> Perhaps the 'hidefromfinder' option in your auto_master setup file has something to do with it?  precode/net            -hosts      -nobrowse,**hidefromfinder**,nosuid /home           auto_home   -nobrowse,**hidefromfinder** /code/pre  From the auto_master(5) man page:     The        hidefromfinder option is used on maps that shouldn't show up as folders in the Finder; it causes the UF_HIDDEN        flag to be set on the root directory of the map.   <comment134692> What happens if you type "Shift-Cmd-G" in Finder and enter `/Shares/Music` directly? <comment134693> @patrix: tried that and forgot to mention above - it does open the folder and displays/lists the content perfectly fine. <comment134694> It is not specified for the /Shares one(s).. so that shouldn't affect them (and these lines are Maverick default ones, so I wouldn't want to touch them).
