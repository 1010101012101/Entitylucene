Switch Gmail from POP (and local folders) to IMAP <body> A friend of mine has used Gmail with Apple Mail with POP setting. He has actually stored thousand of mail to local folder in Apple Mail.  Now I suggested him to switch to IMAP in order to easily sync and use mail with multiple computer. The problem is: how can I recreate his local folders structure to GMail? Do it manually is not an option, he has thousand of mail in a gazillions of folder. Import messages doesn't work because that would probably result in duplicate mail (the account is the same). Any suggestion?
