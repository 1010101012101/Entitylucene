Videos in shared photostream not playing <body> I have a shared photostream with 7 people subscribing to photos. Now that iOS 7 is out, I was eager to try and share a video. I captured one using my phone and edited in iMovie on the phone, exported to camera roll in 720p and then put it on my shared photostream.   I can play the video from my iPhone that uploaded it, but not from my iPad. There's just a spinner that never disappears. My subscribers have the same issue, regardless of phone/iPad.  The clip is 18 seconds long, by the way.  Any suggestions?  <comment121708> +1. Sad really. Youre supposed to be able to upload 5 mins of 720p i think. Its just the same for me as for you.

Strangely I have one subscriber who can view on her ipad but don't know what makes her special!
