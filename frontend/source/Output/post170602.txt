Open terminal via AppleScript <body> I'm tring to write a shortcut script in spark for opening the terminal.   precodeon run {input, parameters}    tell application "Utilities/Terminal" // tried Utilities:Terminal and Terminal too     reopen     activate   end tell  end run /code/pre  how can make this work? I'm using 10.10.2 as OSX version.  <answer170603> precodetell application "Terminal"    activate   tell application "System Events" to keystroke "n" using {command down} end tell /code/pre  Should do the job.   <answer170604> This is the correct method:  precodetell application "Terminal"     if not (exists window 1) then reopen     activate     -- insert your code here end tell /code/pre  EDIT You can open new windows with do script  precodetell application "Terminal"     do script "" end tell /code/pre  <comment200588> I want it to open multiple times so I tried to put reopen(didnt work) then wrote this: do shell script "open -n /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app" but the problem is I can't switch tabs with cmd`(below esc) button <comment200589> this is a better solution. can you check my comment on Matthiue's answer. <comment200590> Do you want 1 terminal window or a new window for every time you run the command? <comment200591> I want more windows. I want to be able to pass them with cmd` shortcut
