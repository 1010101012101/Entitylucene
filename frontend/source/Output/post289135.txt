iPhone voicemail malfunction <body> The voicemail on my iPhone used to work well, so basically if I click the codevoicemail/code button on the interface of codePhone/codeapp, I would get a list of voicemail that I can choose from and listen to.  But recently, I found that whenever I click the voicemail button, I was transferred to a call as shown below and it looks pretty much like a virus to me.     Click the voicemail button on the lower right corner,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9mkJm.png" alt="enter image description here"     You will be automatically transferred to a call,   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NtBoom.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is this a virus or some mis-configuration of my iPhone?  <answer289137> Reboot the phone.br If no better ring your provider.    Mine did that after I changed my phone contract [with the same provider, just a different plan] &amp; they had to reset it from their end.  <comment365233> Solved my problem, basically I have to reset the password for my voicemail after upgrading my plan. Not a virus. <comment365246> @Nicholas [It's *definitely* not a virus](https://www.xkcd.com/1180/).  Before [visual voicemail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_voicemail) (or even now on carriers which don't support it), voicemail on a cell phone was accessed by dialing a specific number and using the keypad to select menu options.  Your phone most likely failed to load visual voicemail, so it fell back to dialing the voicemail number. <comment366826> Very funny and informative!@NobodyNada
