Late 2009 Macbook - Has Anyone Tried 16GB of Ram? <body> Just curious if anyone has tried maxing out the ram on a late 2009 Macbook (white, not pro) to 16GB running El Capitan or Yosemite?   Everymac's page states that the max is 8GB. Why not 16GB?  Thanks!!!  <answer217363> The chipset and processor may not support more RAM, even though you can physically put it in. You can always try. Weird behaviour and instability result from that.
