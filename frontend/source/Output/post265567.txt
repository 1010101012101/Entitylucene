Macbook Pro Late 2016: R Studio and texmaker keep quitting unexpectedly <body> I have the Macbook Pro Late 2016 with the updated macOS Sierra Version 10.12.2. R Studio and texmaker keep "quitting unexpectedly". This occurs even when I have not used the applications - I have just opened them and have them in the background. I tried restoring to factory settings which did not fix the problem.
