Change Replace keyboard shortcut in Gedit <body> I'm a Linux user trying to get used to Mac. I've already swapped the kbdCommand/kbd and kbdControl/kbd keys around.  I'm using Gedit in Mac now, and the replace key combination I'm used to (kbdControl/kbd-kbdH/kbd) is hiding the Window.  I've been using Karabiner to remap keys, and have been trying to figure out private.xml syntax to remap this how I want it to behave.  Here's what I have so far (not working):  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;      &lt;name&gt;Change Control-H (Command-H Hide in Mac) to Replace for gEdit (Control-Alt-F)&lt;/name&gt;      &lt;identifier&gt;private.control_h_to_replace&lt;/identifier&gt;      &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::H, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, VK_COMMAND,KeyCode::F&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  I've also tried to remap it using Mac's settings  keyboard  shortcuts.  The Mac keyboard is driving me batty.  <answer255869> Your syntax for Karabiner is off.  This will work. Note that, like @klanomath, I have no idea if you're actually trying to use kbdCommand/kbd-kbdH/kbd or kbdControl/kbd-kbdH/kbd, so you may need to change codeCOMMAND_L/code to codeCONTROL_L/code on the third line.  precode        &lt;autogen&gt;             __KeyToKey__             KeyCode::H, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L,             KeyCode::F, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L         &lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  It also now occurs to me that in your version, within the code, your replacement command is kbdCommand/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdF/kbd as opposed to kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd-kbdF/kbd as specified in the codename/code. So you might need to adjust codeCONTROL_L/code to codeCOMMAND_L/code on the fourth line.  <comment318801> Please sanitize your question. You are mixing cmd-H and ctrl-H in the headline and the body as well as in the xml file. ctrl-H (on an Apple keyboard) doesn't hide anything! <comment318901> Thanks - I cannot sanitize what I don't understand, I guess... I have already swapped my command and control keys around.... does that change anything? <comment318903> Thanks, @tubedogg - I did need to change CONTROL_L to COMMAND_L. <comment318904> You might also want to replace `COMMAND_L` on the 3rd line with this: `MODIFIERFLAG_EITHER_LEFT_OR_RIGHT_COMMAND` (in case you don't always use the left Command key to hit H). <comment318905> If you don't mention that you already swapped the ctrl and the cmd key in Karabiner - which is impossible to guess based on your question, we can't give a decent answer. <comment318906> Fixed, thanks, and sorry. :)
