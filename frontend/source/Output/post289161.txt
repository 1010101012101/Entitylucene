How can I tell which Desktop a window is in using AppleScript? <body> I would like to use AppleScript to perform operations on a particular application only if that application has windows in the current Desktop. Is there any way to do that?  <comment365253> https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125127/how-to-get-a-list-of-application-windows-only-from-the-current-desktop-with-appl/125250#125250 any help? <comment365254> That is what I was looking for. Thank you. <comment365275> There is a major issue with using System Events, because it will wrongfully report any minimized windows on other then the current Desktop of the target application as belonging to the current Desktop. So, System Events is not reliable, in, of, and by itself, in this use case. <comment365290> Ah. Fortunately, you could get around that by asking whether windows are visible. I don't really use minimized windows so I probably won't bother rewriting my script.
