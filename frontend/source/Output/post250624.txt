How do I search footnotes in a Pages Document? <body> When I try to search for an existing footnote's number no results come back. Is there some special setting to search for footnotes?  <answer250627> I have an older version of Pages, which I normally do not use as I use LibreOffice, however I just created a document in Pages, added a Footnote and then clicked strongEdit/strong  strongFind/strong  strongSearch/strong and typed in a emnumber/em.  It found all occurrences of that emnumber/em which included both emnumbers/em in the document body and in the Footnotes.  I could easily tell which was the Footnote vs a emnumber/em in the body of the text as the emnumber/em was the first character in a given line after the ellipsis.  Not as nice as having a strongGo to Footnote [coden/code]/strong emcommand/em but I still found the Footnote.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JtnU4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment311290> Hmm, that doesn't work for me on a newer version of Pages. Perhaps it could be the document I'm using was imported from a word doc and that is causing the issue. <comment311291> @Steve Moser, Does it work on a document that was originally created in Pages, in the newer version?
