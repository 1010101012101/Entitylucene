Snow Leopard to Yosemite update button dark grey and disabled <body> I have checked that my computer is eligible for the new Yosemite update but when I click on the update button, the button goes a dark grey colour so I cannot click it and as a result nothing happens and Yosemite does not install. iMac 24â€³ 2008 with Snow Leopard 10.6.8.  <comment189035> have you tried signing out & back into the Store?
