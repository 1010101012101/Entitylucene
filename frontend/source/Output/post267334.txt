Are there iOS mail apps that do not store your credentials? <body> I was researching various iPhone default email app alternatives. All of the ones I checked (Airmail, Spark, Outlook, EasilyDo Mail) ask for and store your credentials in the cloud. That means I have to trust that their servers will never be hacked into and that none of their employees would abuse their access rights. Considering most of the apps are run by small companies, I don't expect too much from them.  The only exception I found is Dispatch. From their FAQs page:     Dispatch does not use any intermediary servers to connect your device   to your mail server; your device connects directly to your mail server   to fetch and send email. Because of that, we do not store your   credentials anywhere else besides in the secure keychain of your   device. Your credentials are never transmitted anywhere else besides   to your own mail server for authentication.   Are there any other apps that do not require your login credentials?
