How to clear ALL items from Safari's reading list? <body> How to clear ALL items from Safari's reading list? I have 100's of items in the list so do not want do do them individually.  I tried removing codeBookmarks.plist/code in code~/Library/Safari//code which deletes the reading list on the mac locally but iCloud just adds them back, when syncing.  <answer96850> Does this not work? Seems to for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ORJUb.png" alt="Clear All"   <answer101282> Swipe item on list you want to delete. Delete option will appear.  <answer234998> In more recent Safari versions where the button has gone away, just right-click or Control-click an item in the list. The context menu will show a Clear allâ€¦ choice there.  <comment113652> Yes this work, must have missed it since, it not on the iPad or iPhone <comment113653> Oh, I see. I only ever use it on the desktop, so I was a little confused about it now working for you. <comment169641> I don't have this in Safari Mac (7.0.6). <comment171306> @NicolasBarbulesco They moved it to a contextual menu. Right click on any item and you'll get an option to clear all. <comment186958> @funroll - Thank you for the tip. This is a rather weird use for a contextual menu. <comment287858> Thanks the answer above no longer works on Sarari 9.
