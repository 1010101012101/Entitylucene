Can you share or save iPhone voicemail messages? <body> Is there a way to export or e-mail voicemail (not Voice Memos) from the iPhone (running iOS7)?   I am guessing there are some under-the-hood ways to get at the files once you sync to a desktop, but is there any way to do it straight from the phone? (Actually, even a desktop-based solution would probably help.) I have seen this response for jailbroken phones.  <answer107686> I believe there are applications that can extract the voice messages from your phone but they cost money and required the phone be plugged in to the computer.  The simplest way is to connect your phone to your computer with a 3.5mm audio cable. Use a simple audio recording app, such as Audacity, click record and play the voice message.   <answer116701> I used a third party app called strongTouchCopy/strong to save my iPhone voicemail messages to my computer.     TouchCopy allows you to play and copy Voice Mail messages you have received on your iPhone. To view all Voice Mails stored on your iPhone, click the Voice Mail button in TouchCopy.      TouchCopy will copy messages from your iPhone if your iPhone supports Visual Voice Mail. These will be voice mails that are provided as part of the Visual Voice Mail data plan from your mobile service provider.   supSource: Copying iPhone Voice Mails with TouchCopy/sup   Note that the voice mails actually need to be stored on your iPhone rather than by the network operator for it to work.   <answer117190> Most people use PhoneView for this. It's an app from Ecamm:  http://www.ecamm.com  You plug the iPhone to the Mac, and it all shows up on the computer.   <answer129349> I have used http://VoicemailsForever.com It was really simple and took me just a few minutes to get it done.  <answer129865> I've used Decipher Voice Mail for a year or so and it saves all my iPhone voicemails as mp3 files on my computer. Great little program that enabled me to save my grandmother's voicemails after she passed away.  <answer136829> http://science.opposingviews.com/forward-voice-mail-messages-iphone-14321.html  this is a link that will tell you how to forward messages, depending on your carrier.  <answer139275> Connect your device to iTunes using USB or Wi-Fi, select the device, then the Music tab and check the Voice Memos option, then sync the device.  <answer140654> I have a Google Voice number that I just forward important voicemails to.  To do this in a typical voicemail system, you'd press 6 for more options, then 2 to forward it.  You can keep them in your Google account pretty much as long as you want, or you can simply download them at will.  I hope this is helpful.  <answer164681> Here are a few more programs that let you export voicemails from your iPhone to your PC:  ul liiMazing/li liiBackupBot/li liiExplorer/li /ul  All three programs run on Mac or Windows.  They are not free, however iMazing and iBackupBot actually let you export voicemails in their trial modes.  iExplorer does not let you export voicemails in its trial mode.  <answer188013> Have Siri call your voicemail for you... Follow the voicemenu prompts....ez  <answer202325> No - iOS versions up to and including iOS 9 do not allow you to forward, edit, share or otherwise push a voicemail that is stored on the device.  You'll need to avail yourself to a jailbreak mod (I don't recommend this) or a tool to read the files from the phone when it's paired with a computer. You can use USB or WiFi pairing and there are many choices of apps to grab the voicemail files but they depend on your choice of computer OS.  Lastly, contact your carrier - they might allow you to forward a message that's still on their servers or be able to assist you. Again - there are hundreds of carriers, so that's more a thing to research for your specific carrier or change carriers if you can find one to help with this function/feature.  <comment126265> Does the solution need to be free or built-in to iOS? Is a computer-based alternative acceptable? <comment126286> Thanks. I suppose recording to Audacity or GarageBand, etc is a reasonable option if there is no internal method. <comment164246> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment164296> I was wondering about voice mail from incoming calls, not the memos recorded with the Voice Memos app... <comment262784> This is built into iOS 9: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205012
