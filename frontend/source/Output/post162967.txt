Combining Thunderbolt ports <body> I've a Macbook Pro retina 15'', mid-2012 with nVidia 650M graphics card. I've a 4K Dell monitor attached but the result is a bit choppy and my guess is that it's because of the bandwidth limitation on the Thunderbolt port?  If so, can I somehow combine both thunderbolt ports and connect the external to both together?  Thanks  <answer162977> Your computer has a "Thunderbolt 1" port. Apple states in this FAQ article on thunderbolt ports as an answer to question #25:     4K Ultra HD TVs are supported over HDMI or with Thunderbolt to   high-speed HDMI adapters. Thunderbolt 2 is required to use a 4K   display. All Thunderbolt 2 models support 4K displays at 30Hz in   Single Stream Transport mode. Some models support 4K displays at 60 Hz   in Multi Stream Transport mode. See HT6008 for more information on   using 4K displays. Specific 4K DisplayPort displays are supported on   Thunderbolt with a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable.   <comment190724> Yeah, I understand that and I can run the 4K -- just the result is not as smooth as I'd like. That's why I was wondering if there was a way to combine the two ports to get higher bandwidth <comment190730> @Opt No you can't, you need a Thunderbolt 2 port to run 4K smoothly.
