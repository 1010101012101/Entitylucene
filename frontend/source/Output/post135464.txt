view all windows in Mavericks keyboard shortcut <body> In Mavericks (and any other version of OSX) when pressing kbdCMD/kbd + kbdTAB/kbd you see the typical list of open apps to switch to.  I just discovered that when this list is open (before releasing kbdCMD/kbd) if you press kbd1/kbd you see all the windows of currently the selected app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RuUN2.png" alt="enter image description here"  What is this feature called? Is it possible to use it outside of the kbdCMD/kbd + kbdTAB/kbd list?  <answer135468> You can also configure hot corner to achieve this.   <answer135471> I am pretty sure this feature is called "Application Windows". If you go to System Settings - Mission Control, in the bottom section is a list of four items you can attach to keyboard shortcuts. This feature is called "Application windows" in that list.  Additionally, you can enable a Hot Corner for it: Click the Hot Corners button in the bottom left of the Mission Control settings; you should be able to specify a special action for moving your mouse into each corner of your screen. This feature is called "Application Windows" in the list of options.  <comment160562> Can you add some details on how to accomplish this with hot corners? Not everybody reading your answer might be familiar with the concept.
