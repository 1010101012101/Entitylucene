Files gone after disk utility repair tool. however, space on disk remains <body> I stupidly repaired my external hard disk without backing it up via mavericks's disk utility repair option.  After the repair, all my folders disappeared but at the same time I noticed that the disk space still remained the same. Is there anyway to get these files back? My thesis is on it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FCXB.png" alt=" See capacity and number of files"  when running disk repair again, it managed to find the files but at the same time it doesnt restore it  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IODUR.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odrPP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148446> Set the Finder to show invisible files. The following Applescript will toggle that on/off.    The report says files were moved to a folder called "." which will be invisible.
