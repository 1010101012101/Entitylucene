DiskAid is not recognising my IPOD <body> I installed DiskAid and its not recognising my iPod Shuffle (it's showing message "Please connect your device" when I have already plugged in my iPod). Is there any other good app for OSX which is useful to copy and paste music on iPod?  <answer141242> To use DiskAid with an iPod Shuffle you need to enable "disk use" within iTunes.  ul liPlug your iPod shuffle into your PC or Mac./li liOpen iTunes./li liSelect your shuffle in the list on the left-hand side of the iTunes window./li liCheck the "Enable disk use" box under Options near the bottom of the Summary tab within iTunes./li liClick Apply./li /ul  If you open DiskAid now, you should be able to use it with your shuffle.  <comment166429> What prevents you from using iTunes? <comment166446> Thanks Alistair, The "enable disk use" checkbox is already selected. Please check screen shot here. <comment166454> I want to copy music from mac to ipod and vice versa <comment166457> http://snag.gy/ucuQH.jpg <comment166461> That's what iTunes does as well (and much better than DiskAid or any other similar tool), so is there a special reason to *not* use iTunes? <comment166465> I tried to copy from itunes, but it does not allow even I tries to drag items from itnubes to mac <comment166468> Might be an idea to turn off "Manually manage music" and try again.
