iTunes backup also WhatsApp chats? <body> a friend of mine has an iPhone 3GS and is swtiching to an iPhone 4S. Now, she's tried to backup all her WhatsApp chats using the WhatsApp backup, but it gets stuck. So I'm thinking whether iTunes backup may do that too.  I know iTunes backups everything on your iPhone, so if those chats are on her iPhone it should work, isn't it?  So should I connect the iPhone to a PC/Mac and start an iTunes backup? Would that work to get the chats back when I'll restore the backup in the 'new' iPhone?  <answer242850> iTunes backup does backup WhatsApp; if you're able to complete it you can restore it to the new iPhone.  There is a guide on the support site: https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201269  <answer242861> iTunes should save all your data (including Whatsapp chats &amp; images) in a backup. Besides that, if you've iCloud turned on for Whatsapp you should also be able to make or restore a backup at any time with iCloud.

For people like me who - for some reason - still have to change their iPhone 4 to 6s in 2017, you can bump into the problem that Whatsapp gets stuck while backing up on iCloud. It took me a while but I solved it eventually with the following steps:  ul liStop Whatsapp from being stuck: Settings  iCloud  switch off Document Data &amp; WhatsApp/li liDelete your current Apple ID account on your iPhone 4 Create a new free Apple ID ON YOUR IPHONE 4: Settings  iTunes en Appstore  Create new free Apple ID /li liSettings  iCloud  switch on Document Data &amp; WhatsApp Go to Whatsapp  Create backup /li liOn iPhone 6 log off with current Apple ID (and make sure you log off with iCloud AND iTunes) and log in with the new ID you created on old iPhone 4 /li liOn iPhone 6 install Whatsapp from Appstore and import the backup from iCloud/li /ul  iPhone 4 (iOs 7) has a problem with updated iCloud (Drive) but via this bypass you can do the trick.  <comment298818> Wouldn't it be easier to solve the WhatsApp backup issue, maybe with the help of WhatsApp support? <comment298824> I don't know, we created a new Apple ID and logged in with this one to make another backup in that iCloud, but no way, it still gets stuck in the middle of the backup and starts back.. @patrix <comment298867> Yeah it should, but it gets stuck when she tries to make a Back Up of WhatsApp :/ <comment298908> Is the size of the backup smaller than the free space on iCloud? <comment298915> Probably not, that's why I told her to make one from iTunes to her computer @patrix <comment299079> Have you tried disabling and reenabling iCloud already? (in Settings) You can also try to log out and log in with your Apple ID in the settings app. <comment299082> Tried to log out and back in <comment299275> Hmmm... Really weird... <comment299279> Yeah! I've contacted WhatsApp support now, will try to figure out the issue and let you updated :) <comment299447> Great! If you need anything else, I might be able to help you. <comment299448> Yeah thank you @JelleZwiers  Will surely let you know!
