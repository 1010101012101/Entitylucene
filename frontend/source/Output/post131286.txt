Contact information frequently removed from contacts except email address <body> I frequently (at least once in 3-4 months) lose all my contact phone numbers.  I see the contacts but if I click the contact name, I see their phone numbers, address all cleared except e-mail address. Its happened at least 3 times in last one year.  I don't know why and how to fix it.
