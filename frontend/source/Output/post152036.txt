How can I run a script or app as sudo with a click? <body> I have a certain program that doesn't work right unless I run it as sudo.  I don't mind having to type in my password, but I'd like to get out of the whole process of opening command line and typing "sudo ./"+script name.  If you create a script that runs as sudo and click it, it just fails due to permissions.  Is there a way to do this more quickly?  <answer152226> Run codesudo visudo/code (or codeEDITOR=nano sudo visudo/code) and add a line like this:  precode%admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/myscript /code/pre  Then create a code.command/code file that runs code/usr/bin/myscript/code:  precodeecho sudo myscript&gt;~/Desktop/test.command chmod +x ~/Desktop/test.command echo $'#!/bin/sh\nls /var/root'|sudo tee /usr/bin/myscript;sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/myscript /code/pre  Or if for example you want to run codesudo purge/code without having to enter a password, add  precode %admin ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/purge /code/pre  to sudoers.  <comment178915> I would caution you from disabling the sudo system wide, it is there to protect you. Try adding the password in your script. <comment178943> I don't know how to add passwords to a script.  My question isn't about disabling sudo system wide. <comment178947> add this to your script (do shell script "whatever" user name "username" password "password" with administrator privileges) replacing the "" with your stuff.
