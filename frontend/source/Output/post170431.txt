accessing Keychain Access from terminal - OSX <body> I am on codeOSX/code and using my terminal to access my codeKeychain Access/code. So I use this command  precodesecurity find-internet-password -a myaccount -s myservice -g /code/pre  and it works correctly but before I can get the response to this query, there is a pop-up showing and telling me that codesecurity wants to use confidential data kept in the Keychain.../code (translated from french). Why is it so? How can I desactivate it?   Btw, I tried to codessh/code to my own computer, in order to prevent the popup to show, but then I got no output when I ran the same command...  <answer170492> This is to protect your keychain from being accessed by a malicious script that might try to read it and mail it elsewhere.   If you say OK to the message it will not ask again (usually) so you only have to give it permission the first time.
