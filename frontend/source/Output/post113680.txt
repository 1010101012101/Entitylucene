How to open Google Drive links directly in Google Drive app <body> Is there a way to do this? Currently, the GDrive links I click in my emails open in Safari.  Is this currently a limitation of the app (or iOS 7)? Is there a configuration I can change?  <answer159973> If you open the links in the Gmail app for iOS, and you have the necessary Google Drive app installed (Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and/or Google Slides), Gmail will by default open the links in a Google Drive app. You can enable or disable that feature in Gmail through Menu  Settings  Google Apps.  Alternatively (though it's less direct), you can paste the link into Chrome for iOS, and there will be a bar at the top of the page to open the link in a GDrive app.  <answer227149> Apparently you can append the url with the respective Google app to which it belongs. So if it is a Google Sheet, append the url with codeGooglesheets:///code. If it is a doc, I'm guessing you would use codeGoogledocs:///code  So if the url is codehttp://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/Google-document//code, append it with the appropriate app prefix (in this case codeGooglesheets:///code like so: codeGooglesheets://http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/Google-document/code.  PS: The issue is discussed at length here.  <comment188074> Yes, with iOS 8 this is now possible. Thanks. <comment276163> Looks like two google employees saw the pre-edited version, else why the downvotes?  ;) <comment371855> To "append" means to put on the end. To "prepend" means to put at the beginning. You mean "prepend", not "append".
