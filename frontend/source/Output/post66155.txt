tool to remember window positions when I plug in/unplug an external display <body> When I have a giant Thunderbolt monitor plugged into my MacBook, I want windows arranged a certain way.  No full-screen apps, some apps are shown on my small laptop screen, other apps are shown on my Thunderbolt display.  When I unplug the Thunderbolt display, I would like programs arranged differently, e.g., the browser is a full-screen app.  Is there any program that will let me "save" my window state when I have an external monitor plugged in, and save another layout when I don't have any external display, and automatically switch between the two when it detects that external display has been plugged in or unplugged?  I'm on Mountain Lion on a MacBook Pro.  <answer66157> Moom  by Matt Gemmell  http://manytricks.com  <answer66189> h2Stay/h2  by Cordless Dog. It saves window state for each display configuration you might have.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ssapD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66234> Slate allows giving windows different default positions depending on the connected displays. See the developer's configuration file for some examples.  <comment77805> Welcome to Ask Different! Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link.

The problem is that it doesn't always work (I'm running Mavericks) - some apps aren't supported, and I often find that some windows just don't resize.  If it was free I'd recommend it, but as a paid-for app I'd expect reliable performance. <comment175722> +1 for a free and open source alternative.  I installed it and hope to be pleased.  It was also mentioned at the similar question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3133/ <comment355228> It seemed like a good fit. But with 3 external displays it often had problems with the positions and just solved the problem to 50%. So I still had to do a lot of manual work. I just deinstalled it. Oh, and its only 30 day trial!
