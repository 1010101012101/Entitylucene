What is the OSX ruler clipboard? <body> I ran codeman pbcopy/code which listed the flag code-pboard/code with options code{general | ruler | find | font}/code.  I understand what the general, find, and font clipboards are, but I can't find any documentation on what use the ruler clipboard has.  <answer232724> The coderuler/code pasteboard, or codeNSRulerPboard/code at the programming level, is:     The pasteboard that holds information about paragraph formats in support of the Copy Ruler and Paste Ruler commands that may be implemented in a text editor.   You can read much more about the Pasteboard here.
