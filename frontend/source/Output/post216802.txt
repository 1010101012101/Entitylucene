Using a high current car charger while using a power intensive application - is more better? <body> I'm very much aware that my iPhone 5 will only use up to 5W for charging - no matter what charger is being used.  However, I've had an experience that makes me think that it's not as simple as this if you are using the device while it's on charge.  I've had a problem whereby my car charger stops charging the battery when I am using the TomTom navigation application - it still displays the charging icon on the phone, but the battery level begins to drop.  I have a spare (both identical small Belkin charger) and if I swap between them regularly then all is well, though unsurpisingly the rate of charge is much slower than when I charge with no power hungry apps running.  So I'm assuming that they are overheating and are no longer providing enough current to keep up with the drain of running the TomTom app.  So I've purchased a 12W car charger in the expectation that it will withstand the higher current drain and that I'll, hopefully, be able to charge the phone at a normal rate while also using the TomTom app.  My question is: can anyone can confirm that the iPhone has a 5W battery charge limit, but a higher total current draw limit?  I ask as I don't have a long drive planned any time soon to test for myself.
