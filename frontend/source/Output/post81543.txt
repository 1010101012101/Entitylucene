How do I change the "primary group" for an existing user? <body> My current primary group (the codegid/code I see listed by codeid/code) is me, rather than codestaff/code. I'd like to change it to codestaff/code, without changing anything else about my user account. How do I change the "primary group" (PrimaryGroupID) for my account?   <answer81553> One way to change your group is through the MacOS System Preferences panel. Open it, and then open the strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong panel. Unlock the lock icon in the bottom-left so that you can enter your password and make changes.  Once the panel is unlocked, you can right-click (or option-click) on the user you want to change and select strongAdvanced Options/strong from the popup-menu. The advanced options panel will let you specify your default group.  To change the primary group from the strongcommand line/strong, first get the ID number of the group and then set the primary group id to that value:  Get a list of groups. You may want to pipe this through less.  precode# dscacheutil -q group /code/pre  Change user "scott"'s primary id to 20:  precode# dscl . -create /Users/scott PrimaryGroupID 20 /code/pre  This solution is from Richard York's blog post on dsclbr emOriginal link dead Oct 15/em - now archived  <comment94023> Where it says just "Group"? Is there a way to do it from the command line? <comment94077> Thanks! My old group was `rax`, which is my user name (both 501). Is there any reason to preserve that by adding myself back as a member of the `rax` group (though not as primary). Without doing so will I still have access to all files with `rax:rax` permissions? <comment94142> Glad to help. I'd add yourself to that group just in case - no harm in doing so. If you don't add yourself to the group, then you'd run the risk of not being able to access a file. <comment310596> looks like with this steps there's additional field `egid` gets added and which still points to staff. is that expected? or is there a way to change that as well
