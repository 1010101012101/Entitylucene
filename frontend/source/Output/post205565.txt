Mac Mini keeps trying to mount encrypted DMG at login <body> I used to have an encrypted dmg image mounted at user login, but I didn't want it to be mounted anymore, thus I removed it from my user's "Login Items", but in spite of that the OS continued asking me the password to mount such dmg image in every single boot.  I have even tried changing its name, but this didn't work either. It keeps showing that annoying dialog for entering the password to mount such disk image that I don't want to mount.  Any ideas on how to avoid this once and for all?  TIA  <answer205693> Ok, finally I managed to solve it by myself. Probably there is a faster way to do this, but I didn't find it out, so I went the most obvious way:  strongCreate a new encrypted disk image/strong with Disk Utility, making sure of leaving the "Remember password in keychain" checkbox UNCHECKED (it seems to be checked by default), then I just strongcopied everything from the old encrypted disk image to this new one/strong and finally, I just strongdeleted the old one./strong  That annoying dialog is not bothering me anymore.  I hope this is useful for someone else.  <comment250859> Removing the password of the encrypted image from your keychain would have been faster probably. <comment251103> @klanomath that's the first thing I did, and that's why «the OS continued asking me the password» and «It keeps showing that annoying dialog for entering the password»
