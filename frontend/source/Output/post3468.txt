Google Pinyin for iPhone <body> Is there a Google Pinyin app for iPhone? Current pinyin on iPhone is really bad.   <answer27214> Currently, no. Google has only released the Pinyin app with support for Windows. A Mac OS X beta did come out last year, but it hasn't been released publicly, and as far as I know, there's no support for mobile devices.
