Launchd starts event 40 seconds later? <body> I've created a code.plist/code file, which should act as system daemon (global with coderoot/code user). This code.plist/code file listens to the codesettings/code directory for changes like changing network settings. When this happens it should start a Bash script.  However, it works but not as expected. When I open a VPN connection it takes about 40 seconds until the Bash script will be executed. I would like it to be executed right after I open the VPN connection.  How to remove the delay before the launch?  Here is the code of code.plist/code file:  precode   &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;    &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;lucafuhl.vpnhelper&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/Users/vpnhelper.sh&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  <answer158196> Two things:  Try placing your  precode&lt;string&gt;/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration&lt;/string&gt;  /code/pre  inside an   precode&lt;array&gt;  &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  Additionally you may be able to watch to see when the change actually happens with the below command.  precodesudo fs_usage -f filesys | grep /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration /code/pre  <comment175446> Please provide your .plist file so we can see what properties you are using. <comment175457> Thanks I totally forgot that... Sorry for that <comment175567> What file inside of SystemConfiguration are you monitoring changes for?  Is it possible that the file isn't modified until 40 secs after the VPN is established? <comment175584> From what I know about this system, I watch all the file in `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration`. I don't know exactly which file is changing. That was the way I found here on stackexchange <comment179233> This isn't a strong area for me but if there's a problem in your plist configuration file, an easier way of creating it would be to use LaunchControl [http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/] - see also launchd.info.
