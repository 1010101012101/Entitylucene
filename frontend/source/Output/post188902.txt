AmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to VGA Adapter resolution is maxing out at 1280x1024 <body> I've got the latest MBPR 13" (i7 - early 2015 on Yosemite 10.10.3) and am trying to use the AmazonBasics Thunderbolt to VGA adapter (located here: http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Mini-DisplayPort-Thunderbolt-Adapter/dp/B00C28L138/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8) with my external monitor. However, when I plug it in, the resolution on the monitor is apparently 800x600, or I can scale it to 1280x1024, which looks super awful and washed out and of course stretched out.  But if I plug in an authentic Apple adapter, it works without issue and looks great.  The reviews for this adapter on Amazon are excellent--has anyone experienced this issue? I've tried multiple AmazonBasics adapters on multiple monitors but it refuses to work.  I returned that AmazonBasics adapter, and got a brand new replacement one, but it still does the same thing!  Help! Anyone have any idea why only the authentic Apple one works and not the AmazonBasics one? And hopefully the solution isn't "go buy an authentic Apple adapter and stop using the Amazon one" because that should not be the case.  Thanks!  <comment223711> As most of the comments below the product on that page say the same thing, chances are you'd be better off with a real one. Caveat emptor. <comment227851> I have the same problem. I'm not sure how @Tetsujin can say that most of the comments below the product on that page say the same thing, because the average rating is 4.4 and there are over 1300 reviews. <comment227858> High ratings PC users, complaints Mac users. Pattern easy to establish in the first page.
