Airpods Bluetooth interference when cycling <body> I use Airpods with the iPhone SE and I also wear an Apple Watch.  The Airpods work extremely well at home, in the office, or whenever I'm just walking.  When I'm cycling to work, however, I often get interference in the Bluetooth connection, leading to stuttering music playback.    Subjectively it feels as if this is more frequent at large intersections with lots of traffic and never happens in the park.  What could be the source of the interference?   I imagine that there are many very strong WiFi hotspots in the area, but then I don't really have problems if I'm walking through the city. It seems to be connected to cycling.
