Apple headphones maximum db output? <body> I've recently got hooked to listening to white noise at work because it helps me focus amidst all the noise. I use the brown noise generator from SimplyNoise for this. I was trying to measure if it was safe to actually listen to noise for around 6-7 hours a day.  For evaluating this, pretty much the only references I've found was that listening to noise at 64dB for 6-7 hours a day is considered "safe" which lead me down this road.  <answer60804> Extracted form Apple's Store In-Ear Headphone's overview:     strongTechnical Specifications/strong      ul   liFrequency response: 5Hz to 21kHz /li   liImpedance (at 100Hz): 23 ohms/li   liSensitivity (at 100Hz): strong109 dB SPL/mW/strong /li   liDrivers: Custom two-way balanced armature (woofer and tweeter in each earpiece)/li   /ul   If you are using the regular Earphones, although I couldn't find any official technical specs, it's dB output would be lower than the In-Ear's, something like strong103 dB./strong  And for the emsafe/em decibels, just remember that:     ul   liA typical conversation occurs at 60 dB â€“ not loud enough to cause    damage./li   liA bulldozer that is idling (note that this is idling, not    actively bulldozing) is loud enough at 85 dB that it can cause permanent damage after only 1 work day (8 hours)./li   liWhen listening to a personal music system with stock earphones at    a maximum volume, the sound generated can reach a level of over    100   dBA, loud enough to begin causing permanent damage after just    15   minutes per day!/li   liA clap of thunder from a nearby storm (120 dB) or a gunshot (140-190    dB,    depending on weapon), can both cause immediate   damage./li   /ul   <comment70099> Thanks! I listen at about 30% of the max volume. Should be ok? <comment70118> Well, if it's roughly 100 dB at maximum volume, you could safely reach to 50%. 30% is perfect, though, if thats enough for you. <comment258289> Good info on the decibel levels!
