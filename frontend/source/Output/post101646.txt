Keeping track of songs in playlists <body> Is there a way to track what songs in an iTunes account appear in playlists? i.e. -- some songs may appear in 2 playlists, some appear in none. How can I know that?  <answer101649> In your iTunes Music Library, right-click on a song's title and select codeShow in Playlist/code from the menu. A submenu will pop out, showing all of the playlists to which the song belongs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PctPl.png" alt="enter image description here"
