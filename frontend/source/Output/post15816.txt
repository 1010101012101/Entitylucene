How Do I Run Xcode <body> I just downloaded and installed Xcode on my MacBook Pro, but I don't see it under Applications or Utilities.  I also don't see a shortcut at the bottom.  How do I run it?  <answer15818> Xcode is located in /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app. Double-click it to open it. If you want, you can make an alias to it in your applications folder.  <answer15819> After you buy Xcode from the App Store you will be left with an 'Install Xcode' application in your codeApplications/code folder -- run that. It'll do the actual install and after all of that is said and done you'll have a code/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/code application in your PATH.  <comment17214> Also note you can use Spotlight to open applications. Press CMD+Space and type the name "Xcode" and it should be the first hit under the Applications heading. <comment25254> And after the installation, be sure to archive the "Install Xcode" app and get it off your hard drive. It takes up 3GB of hard drive space and does nothing. <comment58192> note this is for Xcode 4.0-4.2 - 4.3 runs from /Applications
