Associated Voila files to finder by mistake <body> An associate of mine has managed to associate all his Voila files to Finder, and now he just has a bunch of folders for them.  He wants to revert this but, when he does, at emGet Info/em he has no option to re-associate the folders/files to Voila.  How can this be fixed?  <answer60008> You could reset/unregister Finder file associations with the following procedure:  ul liIn the Finder, press kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdU/kbd to open the Utilities folder./li liOpen codeTerminal.app/code (img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KSBFO.png" alt="Terminal icon") in the Utilities folder./li liTo unregister the associations, paste this into the Terminal window, followed by kbd&#x21B5;/kbd : code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -u /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app -domain user/code/li liTo restart the Finder, type: codekillall Finder/code, followed by kbd&#x21B5;/kbd/li liVoila documents should be Voila documents again./li /ul  Let me know if this works!  <comment68919> I need help to help... what is Viola?
