Is there any way to access the console logs on an iOS 8 device without installing Xcode? <body> The title says it all. Prior to iOS 8, one could use iPhone Configuration Utility, but that no longer works. Is there any other way to access these logs without installing the gargantuan XCode? Are there any third-party utilities that can do this?  <answer183095> There is a tool called iTools  It provides real time system logs just like Console log in iPCU or xcode  ul licodeConnect Your device/code to system. /li liclick on codeitools-&gt;Under iPhone-&gt;&gt;Advanced-&gt;System logs/code/li /ul  <answer222701> With iTools 3.1.9.8 (available for Mac &amp; Windows) you can get logs from your iOS device by selecting codeToolbox/code and codeReal-time Log/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dlABx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer222702> Yes. Apple Configurator 2 has a command line tool that can tail and/or dump the console logs and do some other nice operations like pair, enumerate connected devices, etc...  precodecfgutil syslog /code/pre  That's the official Apple way and it's much smaller a download than Xcode. Both are free but codecfgutil/code is much more powerful and can do things like remove apps, erase, pair, and even run scripts when you attach and detach iOS devices to your Mac.  To make codecfgutil/code available at the command line, open Configurator 2, and choose strongConfigurator 2/strong - strongInstall Automation Tools/strong ... from the menu.  You could also look at homebrew and install libimobiledevice - that is open source and free as well and seems to be kept updated fairly well over time.  precodebrew install libimobiledevice /code/pre  <comment182992> There is a freeware utility:http://lemonjar.com/iosconsole/ <comment183161> Well, then it needs to be made more well known that iOS Console is the only utility (besides XCode) that allows one to view console logs on iOS 8 devices. <comment257958> Very nice utility, and freeware.
