Shortcuts for # and $ not working on Turkish keyboard layout <body> My keyboard layout is "Turkish QWERTY PC" and the problem is that I cannot type the special symbols being typed by using kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd3/kbd and kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd4/kbd which are "#" and "$".  I opened the key viewer and typed kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd3/kbd. It then says that I typed "#" but that's wrong.  Is there any solution to fix this?   I am using a Macbook Pro running Mac OS X 10.6.8.  <answer16957> Try using strongright-side/strong kbdstrong‚å•/strong/kbd+kbd4/kbd.  <answer25326> The most common cause for a key or two not working is that they have been set as triggers for speech recognition or text to speech.  Double check system preferences/speech to make sure this is not the case with your machine.  <answer37842> A brief look around and it seems as though an third party application like Ukelele should help you map keys correctly for your keyboard.
