How can I add a new application to the Open With menu? <body> How can I add an application to the Open With menu (shown after right-clicking) for a given file type, without making that file strongalways/strong open with that application?  In this specific instance, I'd like to the option to open an Web site location (.URL) file with TextEdit, while still defaulting to Safari.    I'm running OS 10.7.4.  <answer15048> Try selecting the file in the Finder and doing File  Get Info. From there you should be able to choose any application to open it with. Once you've opened that type of file in that application once, it emshould/em start appearing in the Open With menu.  strongEDIT: The answer above does not work. Alternate suggestion:/strong   I felt bad that my prev answer was incorrect, so I googled around. I found this tip from Mac OS X Hints:     ul   liControl-click (or right-click) the app in question and select "Show Package   Contents"/li   liOpen the Contents folder in the app bundle. There you'll find a file called Info.plist. This is an XML property list that stores all sorts of information about the app./li   liOpen the file with your favourite text editor. I recommend Hydra, but TextEdit will do just fine./li   liSearch for something that looks like the following:  precode&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;txt&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;srt&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;suffix1&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;suffix2&lt;/string&gt;     … /code/pre      and so forth, with the suffices the app is able to open contained within the tags. Then you simply delete [emor add --newtron/em] the suffix for items you don't want [emor want/em] the app to open./li   liSave the file, and close it (or quit the editor)./li   /ul   <answer15052> Check out the tech-recipes.com for detailed instructions. As @Anriëtte pointed out the app should appear on the Open with menu if it can open the specific file.  <answer15156> newtron's second solution worked for me but only after I opened Terminal and executed the following command:  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  After restarting the system the desired app was in my "open with" context menu.  Thanks  <answer66891> ol liAdd this to the CFBundleDocumentTypes array in code/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Info.plist/code:  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;url&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li licode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -f /Applications/TextEdit.app//code/li licodekillall Finder/code/li liChange the default application back to Safari in Finder/li /ol  If the application is signed, modifying an Info.plist invalidates the code signature. It also makes a few applications like TextEdit and WriteRoom crash on launch on 10.8.  <answer66909> Instead of opening the file with the context menu, you can also drag any file to any desired application while pressing kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd keys. This will force any app to strongtry/strong even if it thinks it can't do so. I use this all the time.   <answer215078> One follow-up to newtron's solution:     There you'll find a file called Info.plist. This is an XML property list that stores all sorts of information about the app.   Open the file with your favourite text editor. I recommend Hydra, but TextEdit will do just fine.      Save the file, and close it (or quit the editor).   You can't save the edited .plist if your account doesn't have the correct permissions (the issue I'm dealing with now--even at admin status you won't have read+write permissions over some files and folders...). To save changes to the .plist files you need to give your user read+write permissions.   Some of the default Mac applications make this difficult to do and I'm currently searching for a solution (will update) to do this with TextEdit.  <answer215910> This worked for me :  Right click your app and goto contents and open /Applications/*****.app/Contents/Info.plist  Open Plist in Xcode as SourceCode and then place this :  precode        &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;array&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;jpeg&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;jpg&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;png&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;gif&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;/array&gt;             &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeIconFile&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;AutomatorApplet.icns&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeName&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;AutomatorApplet.icns&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeOSTypes&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;array&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;GIFf&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;JPEG&lt;/string&gt;                 &lt;string&gt;PNGf&lt;/string&gt;             &lt;/array&gt;             &lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeRole&lt;/key&gt;             &lt;string&gt;Viewer&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  I had 'AutomatorApplet.icns' in Resources Folder.  <answer238255> You can add the option as a Service with Automator and then trigger it with a Hotkey from Keyboard Maestro.  ol liOpen codeAutomator/code and select codeService/code document type./li liSelect codeFiles and Folders/code in the top codeService receives selected/code menu/li liSearch for and select the codeOpen Finder Items/code action./li liNow select codeTextEdit/code in codeOpen with:/code/li liSave the service with a name you want to see in the menus/li /ol  You can now find this by:    ul liRight-clicking the file  Services  /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gxUY0l.png" alt="enter image description here"    OR    ul liFinder Menu  Services (with a file selected)  /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cr3gm.png" alt="enter image description here"  But you don't have to stop there!  I then made a Keyboard Maestro macro so I can just use a Hotkey to do it: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRVqm.png" alt="enter image description here"  I got this idea from this site: http://www.mactricksandtips.com/2013/05/add-open-with-textedit-or-any-other-app-to-right-click-menu-item.html  <comment16247> If the program can open it, then it will add itself to that menu. Otherwise, it means it can't open it. <comment16273> This doesn't work for me because I don't want to change the default application which opens the file.  I just want an additional choice. <comment16387> This seems to not always be true.  TextEdit can open URLs, but it is not in the "Open With" submenu. <comment16388> This does not seem to work.  In "Get Info", I can "Open With" the same applications as normal, or choose "Other".  If I choose "Other", I can choose from all applications, and either check or uncheck "Always Open With".  Even after opening the file once with TextEditor, it does not appear as an additional option in the "Open With" submenu. <comment16394> Shoot, you're right. I will edit the answer to reflect this and update it with an alternate suggestion. <comment16909> This updated answer doesn't work all by itself, even after a reboot. <comment78811> Think this method worked in snow leopard..http://superuser.com/questions/222065/how-can-i-add-a-program-to-the-open-with-menu-on-a-mac <comment79762> Perhaps it's just my computer, but this does not work for me.  After following this procedure (to step 3), TextEdit is not available under "Open With" for .URL files.  Also, modifying Info.plist seems to cause TextEdit to crash in 10.7, too. <comment260875> Please add what you tried to achieve by adding the dict entry. As your answer stands now, it doesn't use the example (.url) given in the question. <comment293093> Is there a way to make this more general? E.g. I want my hex editor (currently HexFiend) as an option to open *every* goddamn file type including those not having a file extension... <comment328321> This is also useful if you want to clear the list and start again. e.g. VMWare Fusion had placed entries somehow that where orphaned when the corresponding VM was deleted. Using this cleared the incorrect entries
