How do I access the user Library from a Time Machine backup? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do you access the user library on a time machine backup       I need to access my library folder in a time machine backup that is from a different mac.  How can I do this?  The real problem is that I backed up with time machine, reinstalled the OS and when I tried to put everything back I ran into problems. I tried using migration assistant, and it transferred everything but my user (which is basically just applications). I was able to right click on the time machine icon and browse what is in the backup file - thus manually restoring all of my data, however, without having access to the library folder there are many things I am unable to copy over.  <answer39027> The Library folder is probably just hidden by Finder. You can show hidden files by running this in Terminal:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true &amp;&amp; osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"'/code  Changing codetrue/code to codefalse/code reverts the setting.  <comment44181> related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21295/how-do-you-access-the-user-library-on-a-time-machine-backup
