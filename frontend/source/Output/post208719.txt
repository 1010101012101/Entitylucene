How to Sync Notes El Capitan to iOS 9 via IMAP <body> Yes, I know Apple says this will no longer work. But it continues to work just fine on iOS 9 devices. Both iPad and iPhone iOS 9 devices continue to sync via my IMAP account. I enter or modify a note on iPad and I see the change on iPhone immediately, and vice versa. And my web mail client see the Notes folder with the updates. All sub-folders are visible in iPhone and iPad and in the web mail client...but not on Mac OS X.  How can I fix my Mac Notes configuration to reenable syncing via IMAP? I don't need the new features of Notes on El Capitan... I need basic synchronization of simple notes between all devices. I can't use iCloud or any other for-profit web service, I need to sync through a specific IMAP server for compliance reasons.  I've tried restoring the old Notes app, but Apple disallows this during the Time Machine restore function.  Thanks  <answer211622> When using notes.app in El Capitan, I've noticed that the account settings are lost in the Notes config file. It's a sqlite3 file, I've described what to do in my blog: Refaire fonctionner Notes avec IMAP sous OSX El Capitan. It's in french you may use google translate if you can't read french.  It says that you need to open with sqlite3 file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/NotesV6.storedata and execute some SQL statements with your imap settings (account, server, prefix)  <answer229112> For anyone else stumbling over this because Notes.app stopped syncing IMAP based notes in El Capitan 10.11.3, the solution which worked for me is the following:  Firstly, check that the strongIMAP Path Prefix/strong is correct for the account. This can be done in emSystem Preferences / Internet Accounts / (select your account) / Advanced/em or in emMail.app / Preferences / Accounts / (select your IMAP account) / Advanced/em. In my case, this was set correctly to codeINBOX/code, but sometimes requires different values, or no value at all.  Secondly, the solution given above by @rene actually works, but it's in French, so here's a step-by-step approach that worked for me.  ol liOpen Terminal.app to get a command prompt/li liChange directory to the following folder:/li /ol  codebash&gt; cd ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes//code  ol start="3" liMake a backup the file NotesV6.storedata so that you can restore it in case something goes wrong/li /ol  codebash&gt; cp NotesV6.storedata NotesV6.storedata.old/code  ol start="4" liOpen codeNotesV6.storedata/code with sqlite3/li /ol  codebash&gt; sqlite3 NotesV6.storedata/code  ol start="5" liA new sqlite prompt will appear - you can always exit by pressing codeCTRL-D/code/li /ol  codesqlite&gt;/code  ol start="6" li(Optional) You can examine the table that we need to fix by entering the followoing command/li /ol  codesqlite&gt; .schema ZACCOUNT/code  ol start="7" liThe codeZACCOUNT/code table contains all accounts which Notes.app is accessing. However, in my case, the IMAP based account entry was missing information about username (field codeZUSERNAME/code), hostname (field codeZHOSTNAME/code) and path prefix (field codeZSERVERPATHPREFIX/code). This is the information we need to update./li liYou can dump the whole table by invoking /li /ol  codesqlite&gt; select * from ZACCOUNT/code  but it's probably easier to select a few relevant fields and identify the codeZ_PK/code id of your account  codesqlite&gt; select Z_PK,ZFULLNAME,ZPARENTACACCOUNTIDENTIFIER,ZUSERNAME, ZHOSTNAME, ZSERVERPATHPREFIX from ZACCOUNT;/code  This produced the following output for me:  precode1|| 4|Exchange|EF792FA7-AAAA-CCCC-5678-123456789012||| 5|IMAPaccount|187229D1-BBBB-DDDD-1234-098765431287||| /code/pre  As you can see by the field divider lines (code|/code) at the end of the last line, fields for username, hostname, and prefix are empty for the IMAP account (codeZ_PK/code id 5) which is what needs to be corrected.  ol start="9" liUpdate the table entry by invoking:/li /ol  codeupdate ZACCOUNT set ZUSERNAME='email@example.com', ZHOSTNAME='imap.hostname.com',ZSERVERPATHPREFIX='INBOX.' where Z_PK=5;/code  You will of course need to set the correct field values and also adjust the codeZ_PK/code id with the correct reference, which you identified above.  ol start="10" liAs soon as I'd updated the table, Notes.app started magically syncing the notes from my IMAP based accounts./li /ol  <comment251732> I restored the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.notes folder from before the El Capitan upgrade. All IMAP notes were restored, and the system quickly synched back to current. New notes posted to any of the subfolders and changes made to existing notes are now synched correctly. Changes made to iPad or iPhone notes are reflected immediately on the Mac Notes. But changes made on Mac Notes do not propagate as quickly. The iPad or iPhone notes need to be manually refreshed to see the updates. --@M.Abel <comment255461> Since this is an english q&a site please add all necessary steps in english instead of posting an almost link-only answer. <comment256149> I noticed that my old iPhone 3S (I still use it!) stopped synching with El Capitan. The captain doesn't seem to deal with oldies any more .-( (angry one-eyed pirate)
