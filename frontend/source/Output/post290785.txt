Macbook Pro booting extremely slow, log in only in safe mode <body> A couple of days ago my Macbook Pro (early 2011) running Yosemite (10.10.5) got very hot. Although it was working perfectly fine, I turned it off. Some extra info: I have a Samsung SSD and upgraded the RAM.  The next day, I tried to turn it on and the booting (progress bar with the Apple logo) was extremely slow. In the log in screen, the trackpad and keyboard did not respond. It can take anywhere between 10-20min to get to the log in screen. The keyboard and trackpad do not respond.  Booting in safe mode, it asked for a wireless keyboard and trackpad that I had previously used. I have been able to log in through safe mode, but in normal mode, after accepting my password, it goes into a black screen only having the mouse pointer. Nothing can be done.  I have followed these answers to no avail. They seem to be the closest ones to my problem.  ul liMacBook startup problems - mouse and keyboard not working at login / stuck on apple logo/li liPassword incorrect after enabling FileVault/li /ul  FileVault was turned off, I've never used it. I reset the NVRAM and SMC, nothing changed.  I can't get into recovery mode (Cmd + R), or use AHT. I can log into target disk mode and safe mode. No other commands seem to work during boot. I verified the hard drive through target mode, the hard drive seems to be fine, although I couldn't run a SMART test through target disk mode.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
