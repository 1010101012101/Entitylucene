Boot Ubuntu from USB stick on 2011 Macbook Pro <body> I have followed these instructions exactly, up until the point where I need to restart my computer and press the alt/options key right after the chime. I have tried doing that, but no menu has popped up - I just get my usual desktop.   Note: I'm using a USB external keyboard.  Any advice?  <comment282682> You said "_I have followed these instructions exactly ..._" however you have not said exactly what those "_instructions_" were or provided a link to said "_instructions_". <comment282684> Thanks for pointing that out - I meant to include a hyperlink in the words 'these instructions' but forgot to <comment282708> Nice edit. To be clear - you need to hold the Command ⌘ which is different than alt or option on Mac keyboards. Assuming you are using the built in keyboard, perhaps editing that into the post will avoid the obvious answer. <comment282715> Hi, thanks for your comment. I've tried holding the ⌘ down, but it didn't work. And no, I'm using an external usb keyboard. I've tried installing reflt, but that hasn't helped <comment282722> Also - on the disk start up page (from system preferences), it only lists Macintosh HD OS X. I think this might be the problem <comment282731> You do not have to wait for the chime before holding down the alt/option key. Your problem really has nothing to do with Ubuntu or your USB stick. When holding down the alt/option key, you should at least get a menu allowing you to select OS X. This this is not working, then the computer must not be reading the keyboard at startup. Why not use the built in keyboard? <comment282734> Unfortunately the built in keyboard stopped working when I spilled a glass of water over it. Would a wireless keyboard solve the problem? Thanks for your input <comment282778> FYI, you need to put an @David somewhere in you comment, otherwise I will not be notified you posted anything.
