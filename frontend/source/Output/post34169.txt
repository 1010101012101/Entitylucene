macbook 13" and the audio jack for sound input <body> I've followed the instructions at this link to set the audio port for input, yet nothing changes as described in bullet 6.  Any idea what I could try next?  <answer34172> Ok,  It seem that the trick in the above link only works if a line in is actually connected. Which wasn't the case...
