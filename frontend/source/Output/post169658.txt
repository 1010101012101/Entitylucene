Why is my ipod shouting everything at me? <body> I must have triggered some bizarre mode and I don't know what it is or how to turn it off.  I can't get it to happen predictably-- whenever I emtry/em to make it talk, it won't. But whenever I try to just put on a song and listen, it starts saying the name of the song and artist, then reading off the names of random playlists even though I'm not using a playlist; I always just pick out of Artists. And it does it emrepeatedly, it won't %^@#ing stop./em It's stronginfuriating./strong I'm trying to listen to a song and it just keeps telling me the name of the song.  Is it broken??  It's the newest nano.  <answer181715> Just google Speakhints and figure out how to turn it the hell off.  <comment199345> It's call VoiceOver, I think. Triple press the home button and it should stop. <comment199348> Close. It was speakhints.
