Which microphone is compatible with Mac mini? <body> I searched a lot and I am stillÂ in doubt about which microphone to use in MC815BZA Apple Mac mini with Inte Core i5 2.3GHz, 2GB, 500GB HD, HDMI and Bluetooth.   What microphone will work with this computer?  I prefer to use Audio line out / headphone minijack (digital / analog) than USB 2.0 port.  <answer60855> I have an older mac mini (2009) - and practically everything works out of the box. (and even some mics show up that I wouldn't even have guessed)  Tested:   ul liline in (no name)/li liiPhone Headset through headphone plug/li liLogitech USB Micro/li liSamsung Bluetooth headset./li liMic of Sony Camcorder through Firewire/li /ul  So more likely than not - all you get will work.  Suppose there might be troubles with professional audio equipment - but these should have good enough support to find out for you.
