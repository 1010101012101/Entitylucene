Mountain Lion: Not joining preferred WPA2 Wifi network <body> My Mac Mini (2011) has always auto-joined networks worked fine until a few days when he stopped  auto-joining my preferred WPA2 Wifi network when I start it up. When I click codeJoin Other Network/code and then  codeShow networks/code my wifi appears. When I double click it I have to enter my password than my mac joins it. But next time I start my Mac, I have to do that again.  How can I get auto-join to start working again?  <answer80543> Go to strongSystem Preferences / Network / Wifi / Advanced/strong and remove your network from list of emPreferred Networks/em.  Now go to strongKeychain Access/strong and remove all airport passwords for this network from strongLogin/strong and strongSystem/strong keychains.  Then restart your computer, join the network, select emsave password/em and emremember network/em.   After that, it should join automatically.  <answer81750> Well, now i can answer my question self.  Go to strongKeychain Access/strong and remove all airport passwords for this network from Login and System keychains.  Then create a new password in System. Enter as password the network password. Item Name and account name: name of the network. Click add. Then double click the new item in list. Change kind to 'airport password'. Then click strongAccess Control/strong and select strongAllow all applications to access this item./strong  Restart your computer if it doesn't joins automatically join it manual, next startup it will works fine again.  <comment92566> Not mentioned, so I think I should ask. Have you checked if your preferred network is listed in "System Preferences - Network - WiFi - Advanced - Preferred Network"? If yes, delete it and check the password. <comment92569> Thanks but  I have tried this already. (Sorry I have forgotten to Write that in the question) <comment94235> Thanks but it hasn't helped.
