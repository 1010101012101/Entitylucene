How to setup macbook disable battery and only turn on when plugged power adapter <body> My MacBook Air 2011 model's battery is broken, often can't be charged, and remains at 1%. Can I disable the use of battery, and only turn it on when it's plugged in with a power adapter?   Sometimes when it's plugged in it's still showing "not charging" and displaying 1%, and operates very slowly. So I guess if I can always only use the power adapter, it can be faster than 1% "low battery mode".  I can't find any related setting in Preferences. Please help, thanks.  <answer267042> First of all, your MacBook Air strongshould not run slower/strong, even with a dead battery, strongif it's connected to AC power/strong.  Secondly, strongyou really should replace the battery/strong, but if you don't want to physically remove the battery, the nearest option to what you want to achieve is to adjust your Energy Saver settings.  More specifically:  ul liGo to System Preferences/li liChoose Energy Saver/li liEnsure you have the Battery tab selected/li liNow adjust your settings under the Battery tab to suit your needs (perhaps ensure they match as far as possible the settings under the Power Adapter tab)./li /ul  You may also want to uncheck the option to show the battery status in the menu bar (as that will only be a constant reminder that annoys you under the present circumstances).  NOTES:  ol liMy steps above are fairly generic as you didn't specify your OS, however they should get you to where you need./li liIf you're certain your computer is running 'slowly' then it's quite possible you have something else going on./li liFinally, you may want to reset your SMC for good measure.

If the battery is generally dead, it is "disabled by default" - it will not work, and if it's weak it will charge always. So you basically already have the situation you described. <comment334888> Let me make it more clear, I want my mac only can use when it plugged power adapter, like a pc notebook get rid of its battery. <comment334891> That's the situation you have now, don't you? <comment334892> sometimes when i plugged power adapter, it still can't shows "not charging" and 1%. I guess if not using battery, it will only use the power adapter only... u know when it display 1%, it get very slow... <comment334893> You'll probably have to open the case and physically disconnect the battery however I'd suggest replacing the battery as the system actually runs better with a properly working battery even when plugged into an electrical outlet.
