Is that possible to change PPTP VPN password on mac? <body> Could I directly reset my password for VPN on mac?  For Windows, I found the instruction below  (source from ehow, not tested as I only has a mac):  ol liLog on to your VPN./li liEnter the "CTRL+ALT+DEL" keys simultaneously and select the "Change a Password" menu option./li liEnter a new password. Then depress the "CTRL+ALT+DEL" keys simultaneously and select the "Lock the Computer" menu option. Immediately unlock your computer. This action will update your cached VPN login information and your VPN password will be updated./li /ol  Can I do this on mac too? Thanks.  <answer39407> No.  To my knowledge, the native VPN client on Mac OS X does not have functionality for changing your password. There is some code in directory authentication that can do this, but in order to change a password used for VPN, you'll likely have to log into a web-based password utility that's bound to the directory the VPN is authenticating to.  Additionally, those ehow instructions are quite vague. It looks a little like the system is authenticating to a VPN at login, much like how OS X can authenticate to a directory service at login. Perhaps it is possible to connect to a VPN prior to login on Windows? On Mac, on the native client, this is not possible: VPN sessions happen AFTER a user has logged in.  Now, if your VPN is authenticating to a Directory Service used for login, it may be possible to change this password inside loginwindow (as changing your account password).
