Hide facebook notifications inside app? <body> May be I mismatched a forum, but I hope, you can help me.br I don't like social networks and facebook especially. But I need to use it. I've installed official application and I'm received annoying notifications like these, from picturebr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJVkL.png" alt="screenshot"  Can I unsubscribe from these or change a setting or do I need to find some way to delete these one by one?  Thanks!  <answer196829> These notifications are controlled by Facebook. Regrettably they can not all be turned off     h2What is People You May Know?/h2      People You May Know are people on Facebook that you might know. strongWe show you people/strong based on mutual friends, work and education information, networks you’re part of, contacts you’ve imported and many other factors.   I recommend giving Facebook feedback about this behaviour and why you wish to turn it off.  <comment235170> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is asking for specific Facebook instructions. <comment235172> You are right, I can't argue. But I still hoping for an answer... <comment235243> If it is impossible to turn off this spam, it is good enough reason to forgot about facebook forever. Thanks a lot, I'll try. Good luck!
