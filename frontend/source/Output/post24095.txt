Preventing TexMaker from opening .tex files by default <body> Is there a way of stopping TexMaker from opening .tex files? I'm using OSX (10.6.8) and have TexShop 2.43 and Texmaker 3.0.2 installed . Even though I have right-clicked on a .tex file and specified codeOpen with: TexShop/code, and clicked on codeChange All/code; TexMaker appears to still have some way of overriding this preference.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GxRYH.png" alt="enter image description here"  I keep both programs on my computer as I find TexMaker useful for debugging linked  code\input/code files, which TeXShop appears not to notice. However TexMaker's insidiousness makes me want to delete it.  <comment26920> What OS version are you using? I can't reproduce this behaviour. <comment26921> 10.6.8 - I just added it to the question. <comment26922> That's what I'm using too. My files are set to open with TeXShop, when I open and save a file with TeXMaker (or TeXMakerX), double clicking on a file (even the same file) opens it with TeXShop. <comment26923> Try rebuilding the launch services database.  In a Terminal window, enter: `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user` <comment26924> hmmm, I'm getting an error `command not found` when I try running `lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user` from within `Support/` <comment26925> You have to type `./lsregister ...` to do it that way (note the `./` before the command name.)
