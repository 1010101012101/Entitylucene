MacBook updated to OS X Yosemite version 10.10 and experiencing problems with hard drive & iPhoto <body> I updated my MacBook to OS X Yosemite version 10.10. Everything seems to be fine... apart from:  ol liMy WD hard drive won't open now - it appears on screen, allows me to enter the password to unlock and then give me this message: /li /ol  NTFS-3G could not mount /dev/disk2s1 at /Volumes/My Passport because the following problem occurred:  /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/fusefs.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) link error; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8). the MacFUSE file system is not available (71)  ol start="2" liMy iPhoto's has a 'no entry' symbol over it and it won't let me access it... does this mean I have lost all of my photos!?!?/li /ol  Any advice on these 2 things would be much appreciated.
