Function keystrokes 'ate' by host when running Win7 in a VirtualBox <body> I'm a recent Mac convert, but still need to use Windows for work related tasks. A man's gotta eat &amp; pay for internet access.  I have VirtualBox setup w/ a Windows 7 VM. The VM has Visual Studio 2008 installed, along w/ various needed utilities. Everything works great or as expected except for the fact that pressing most of the F keys (F1-F12, excluding F5 &amp; F6) are intercepted by the host OS and processed. I know you can press Command+Fn+F to accomplish this; however, a lot of quick access commands are assigned to the F-keys. (Especially F9-F11 for debugging). These are accessed quite often and the 3 finger combo gets old, fast.  Question:  Is there anyway w/ VirtualBox to, perhaps only in full screen mode, to have the host OS pass those through or otherwise not process them w/o the need for Command+Fn?  I've tried googling but haven't had much success.  TIA  <answer13497> With 10.6 and a USB keyboard, the kbdFn/kbd keys pass through to the app; OS-X only intercepts the media functions.  In your OS-X's Keyboard SysPrefs pane, is:      Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard   function keys   selected?  With this selection, my (unshifted) F-keys pass straight through to my VBox VM.  With it unselected, I need to use the kbdFn/kbd key to generate type them (even within OS-X).  <answer13536> Not that I'm aware of, no. However, if you have a full size keyboard, there's a second kbdFn/kbd key to the right of the kbdDelete/kbd key which can be used in place of the kbdCommand/kbd+kbdFn/kbd combination.  <answer41958> also note that in Keyboard == Keyboard shortcuts == "Mission Control" settings disable F11 and F12 for show desktop and show gadgets, excuse me, show dashboard.    <comment14255> Not that I'm aware of, no. However, if you have a full size keyboard, there's a second `Fn` key to the right of the `Delete` key which can be used in place of the `Command+Fn` combination. <comment14272> Not really an answer, but I know that VMWare Fusion can catch the F-keystrokes before the host OS in single window / fullscreen mode ([not in the unity mode, though](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11656/how-to-send-keyboard-combination-that-is-global-shortcut-in-os-x-to-virtual-mac)). <comment14274> @Randolph, many thanks. I wasn't aware of that. That is so much better. You should convert that to an answer so I can mark it. <comment14366> I have done as requested :-) <comment14413> Many thanks. It's good to know I have this option at least when connected to ext monitor/keyboard. <comment14414> Many thanks, that option was not set.
