Unable to write on my external HDD after upgrading to Sierra <body> I upgraded my MacBook Pro to Sierra, and ever since, my WD passport which is  formatted to File system: Mac OS Extended is not writable. It shows that I can only read. How do I fix this?  <comment332449> Have you tried using disk utility to repair disk permissions?
