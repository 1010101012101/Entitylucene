MacBook Pro frequently reboots <body> I'm going to describe the symptoms I'm seeing, diagnostic steps I've taken, then give the hardware configuration below. I would love to have any suggestions on how to fix this, or where to take my investigation next.  ol liWhen the laptop starts "cold", i.e. it has not been used for a few hours, it is just fine/li liAfter a few hours of use (3 or 4), it will hard reboot itself. No error messages visible, no kernel panics found in the logs, as far as I can see. /li liAfter that, the hard reboots come more and more frequently/li liIt appears that the machine stays on indefinitely if not used/li /ol  h2Diagnostic steps/h2  ol start="5" liSuspecting this to be a temperature issue, I installed Fanny and put the laptop on ice (literally, on ice). Even with CPU temperature consistently below 50C, it still would reboot frequently./li liLooking at the Console application, no messages about "kernel" "panic" "restart" or the like./li liBooting into Ubuntu from an external USB drive has the computer working just fine, even if it gets hot./li /ol  h2Hypotheses/h2  ol start="9" liEither a software problem under macos; or/li liAn issue with the harddrive (or possibly some other hardware that ubuntu isn't activating)/li /ol  h2Hardware configuration/h2  Macbook Pro, 15.4 inch, 2.5 GHz, 16 Gb ram Sierra 10.12.6  h1System.log/h1  System.log only has entries mentioning shutdown at times corresponding to intentional shutdowns. Nothing for these hard reboots.   h1Apple Hardware Test/h1  The only information it gives is that I have the wrong wattage of power adapter  <comment374428> Version of macOS?  Also, in your system log, can you find a entry that says "Shutdown cause "?  Also, try running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected. <comment374453> @Allan thanks, updated. Will update again when the computer is stable enough :{ <comment374454> Best of luck...I know *exactly* what you are going through...I'll help as much as I can!
