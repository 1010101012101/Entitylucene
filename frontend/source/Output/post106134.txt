"Install App" does nothing when trying to install Mavericks <body> I'm trying to install Mavricks and it's not working.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBExs0UcJ_0&amp;feature=youtu.be  I already did a system update. I'm currently on lion.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9k2Kh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Says it's paused in launchpad.  <answer106135> It could be that the servers are so overwhelmed with people downloading the new operating system that you have nothing wrong other than being caught in a stampede.  I would say you might try again in 30 minutes and then back off doubling the time you wait until you get a good download.  <comment124717> The icon and button in app store just changed to "downloading". I wish that they'd change the page in the app store to some kind of loading bar. It's pretty janky that you have to go to launchpad to see the progress.
