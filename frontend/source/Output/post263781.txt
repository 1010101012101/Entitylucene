iPad 2nd gen left in storage for a year, will not boot or restore <body> My friend recently asked to purchase my old iPad 2 (2nd gen, not Air). I said sure and brought it out from the closet, where it hadn't been used for maybe a year or so. The following is the situation in detail:  Issues:  1) The iPad will not boot at all  2) The iPad can be detected in iTunes, where it says that it detected an iPad in Recovery Mode. When I attempt to update and recover, it brings the Apple logo up on the iPad screen as well as the progress bar. However, it never makes any progress  Attempts to resolve thus far:  1) Charged the iPad using the original cable/block for 10+ hours. The screen gave no indication of if it was charging, so I have no idea if the battery actually charged  2) Tried to recover in iTunes, since it detected that the iPad was in recovery mode. Again, the restore process never made any progress per the iPad screen (left it for over 8 hours doing this)  3) Tried entering DFU mode and then restore in iTunes. Same issue as #2 above  4) Tried entering DFU mode and manually selecting the ipsw downloaded from Apple's website (version 9.3.5).  5) Tried using ReiBoot. This program could not detect the iPad.  6) Tried using Wondershare.net Dr. Fone. This program DID detect the iPad and seemed like it would be able to recover the iPad...but I'm not willing to pay $70 for it.  At this point, I'm just not sure what the problem is, and what, if anything can be done to just get this device operational again. Any contents that were on the iPad don't matter, as it needed to be wiped clean anyway. Any ideas on what I can do? Or is the iPad possibly bricked?  Thank you for any help!
