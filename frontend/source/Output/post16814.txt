How to tell PackageMaker to Execute a bash script after installation <body> I'm creating a new Installer using PackageMaker. I need to run a bash script after the installation is complete.  In the "Contents" column I have a folder, which is the folder I want to be installed on the target machine. Within the folder, there's a bash file I need to execute.  If I click on the distribution properties and go to actions, I can "open" a file as a "postinstall action", but it won't execute the script.  If I click on the Content::folder and go to "scripts", pick the directory containing the script and put the script name as "postinstall", I get a "could not copy scripts" error.  What am I doing wrong?  <comment18376> Is your postfight script installed as a folder in a package? A common mistake is to forget to store the script since the linking just is a pointer so run something already in the package. It's hard for me to tell from the wording if this might be the case. <comment18438> My minimum target is OsX 10.5. There's no "postfight" script, as far as I can tell. <comment18577> I have just added a folder to the "Contents". Within that folder, a "configure" script is contained, which I need to execute after installation.
