Filling the inputs of SecurityAgent if they exist? <body> I am trying to automate the export of my keychains (system and user), and while my script works if I remove the set values, it does not after adding them.  The error I am receiving is  precodeSystem Events got an error: Can’t get text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 of process "SecurityAgent". Invalid index. /code/pre  It seems that I am asking for something that doesn't exist? Here is the modal  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fndfB.png" alt="System Events"  And here is the code.  precodetell application "System Events"     repeat while exists (processes where name is "SecurityAgent")         tell process "SecurityAgent"             set value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 to "adminuser"             set value of text field 2 of group 1 of window 1 to "adminpass"             click button "Allow" of group 1 of window 1         end tell         delay 0.2     end repeat end tell /code/pre  If possible I would like to detect if there are fields prior to attempting to set so this can work with or without password prompting  <answer181429> This worked  precodeset appName to "username" set appPass to "password"  tell application "System Events"     repeat while exists (processes where name is "SecurityAgent")         tell process "SecurityAgent"             if exists (text field 1 of window 1) then                 set value of text field 1 of window 1 to appName                 set value of text field 2 of window 1 to appPass             end if             click button "Allow" of group 1 of window 1         end tell         delay 0.2     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment215780> Nice, out of interest what do you use it for? since that screen comes up rarely. <comment215781> I was dumping the system keychain via: `security dump-keychain -d /Library/Keychains/System.keychain  keychain-system.txt` <comment215782> @Buscar웃 here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/ehime/9c518f405315dc3087c3
