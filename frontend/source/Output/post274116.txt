How to disable the message notifications of skype on mac? <body> It is annoying that every time a message arrives, a notification pop up in the right corner of the screen, untill you click the close button. How can I disable this?  I found that a software named codegrowl/code may help, but it is not a free solution.  <answer274124> System Prefs  Notifications   Set alert style to None, or Banner, which will disappear after a few seconds.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWqvu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment344567> works perfectly, thanks you!
