Can't launch Mac OS 9 <body> Need to launch Mac OS 9 but it says it is no longer supported, is there a way around that? I am trying to put it and an old version of QuarkXpress on an old 40 GB external hard drive.  I need access to both to open up some old important files.  What are my options?  <answer253196> strongOption 1: Run OS9 Emulator and install QuarkXpress:/strong Found here for free: emaculation.com  strongOption 2: Change filename to work on current QuarkXpress:/strong Assuming you have QuarkXpress on your new mac all you have to do is add the code.qxp/code filename extension at the end of your old filenames and it will open on new versions.  <comment315067> What model of Mac are you using? 10.4 was the last version of OS X that was capable of booting into Classic.
