Migrating multiple iPhoto libraries to Photos <body> I've put off upgrading to El-Capitan because doing so will kill off iPhoto; I've been using it since it came out more than 10 years ago. I'd like to migrate to the new Photos app but am not sure how it will work. Here's my scenario:  ul liAbout 15 iPhoto libraries/li liSome organised by albums, others by events/li /ul  What I'd like to achieve:  ul liConsolidate multiple iPhoto libraries into a single Photos library file/bundle/li liNot lose the organisation I've put together (albums/events), preferably preserving the order (albums/events sorted by date, not by name)/li liDeletion of my old iPhoto libraries after the above consolidation/li liAll photo metadata copied across (timestamps, geolocation, exif, etc)/li /ul  How do I go about achieving this?  (Assume infinite hard drive space, unused aperture installation, 600 GB photos)  <comment265066> I found [this page](http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/how-to-transfer-photos-from-iphoto-to-photos/) @ MacRumors to be very helpful. <comment278332> But that page explicitly says: "There is no tool within the Photos app to combine multiple libraries into one library, so if you have more than one, you're going to need to work with each library separately or use alternate means to combine them." <comment278333> I think http://www.macworld.com/article/2909654/software-photography/how-to-import-merge-and-consolidate-your-libraries-in-photos-for-os-x.html gets much closer, but also offers no definitive answer. The easiest way is probably to first merge iPhoto libraries using iPhoto Library Manager, and _then_ migrate to Photos. But if you've already migrated one libraryâ€¦ that doesn't help you.
