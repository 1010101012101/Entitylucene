How to redirect all my WiFi-hotspot users a certain IP/domain..? <body> Is there any OSX router software or Airport config to redirect all the users that connect to my Airport WiFi-hotspot to a certain domain or local IP?  <comment104832> What you're after is a Captive Portal http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal which Airports cannot make. You will need to venture out and look into third party hardware to make it possible.
