How can I view the signer of a bundle? <body> I have a .bundle that is digitally signed. I can verify this by opening the bundle by selecting "Show Package Contents" and indeed there is a code_CodeSignature/code directory underneath the bundle.  However, I am trying to figure out emwho/em is the signer of the bundle. Is there any way with Xcode, or any other tool, command line or otherwise, to view the certificate that was used to sign the bundle?  <answer58410> If you have the optional command line tools that XCode will install for you, codecodesign/code is the tool of choice.  Using the Terminal app:  precode$ codesign --display -vv /Applications/GarageBand.app/ Executable=/Applications/GarageBand.app/Contents/MacOS/GarageBand Identifier=com.apple.garageband Format=bundle with Mach-O thin (i386) CodeDirectory v=20100 size=24489 flags=0x200(kill) hashes=1218+3 location=embedded Signature size=4169 Authority=Apple Mac OS Application Signing Authority=Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority Authority=Apple Root CA Info.plist entries=27 Sealed Resources rules=14 files=2021 Internal requirements count=2 size=500 /code/pre  And a non-Apple signed app..  precode$ codesign --display -vv /Applications/iTerm.app/ [snip] Authority=Developer ID Application: GEORGE NACHMAN /code/pre  <comment67160> Yep, that does it. Thanks.
