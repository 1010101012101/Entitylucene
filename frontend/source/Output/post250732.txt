Google Drive on iOS doesn't display full file <body> I have an .xsl document uploaded on Drive which has about 6000 rows. I have no problems in viewing it on a computer, on any browser. However, when I try to view it on my phone, using the Drive app, it only displays about 4000 rows, and I can't figure out how to solve this.   Here are two screenshots which shows the view on a computer and on iOS:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bWNMl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NX7lr.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thank you in advance!
