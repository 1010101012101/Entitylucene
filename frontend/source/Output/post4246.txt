iOS 4.2 - What's there for the iPhone 3GS? <body> I have looked at iOS 4.2 wrap-ups and all I can see are features for iPad.  Besides AirPrint (which does not work with my printer), is there anything for the iPhone 3GS there?  <answer4258> Among other things:  ul liemFree “Find my iPhone” (don’t need MobileMe)/em strong— this requires an iPhone 4/strong/li liSafari allows you to search inside the page/li liYou can assign different SMS/MMS/ALERTS to different phonebook contacts/li liAirPlay / AirPrint?/li liA volume slider control in the Multitaskbar/li liNew icon for Voice Memos/li  -  /ul  Anything else?    strongUPDATE/strong: There’s a trick to use the emFind my iPhone/em in a 3GS or similar. I found out that if you create everything from an iPhone 4 (and/or presumably an iPod TOuch latest gen), you can later go to your 3Gs and enter the same data and it will work. :)  <answer4308> new Calendar application with among other things, new birthday icon  <comment4061> i think eventually air print will work on printers  connected  to macs and with software for windows <comment4155> Hmmm, kind of slim pickings. <comment5370> Martin, how's that find my iphone trick again? "create everything"? <comment5399> @Cawas you have to create the account and configure it from an iPhone 4 (with the app Find My Iphone). So all the steps you have to perform as if you had an iPhone 4. <comment5400> Oh, that's a very interesting trick! Thanks for sharing it! :)
