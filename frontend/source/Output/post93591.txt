Or if you know its coordinates, codescreencapture -Rx,y,w,h/code (rect) captures a specified area.  code-R/code is only shown in the help message and not on the man page.  codesystem_profiler SPDisplaysDataType/code shows information about connected displays. codeosascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to bounds of window of desktop'/code shows the combined dimensions of displays.  <comment109821> A little more information would help. Are you trying to take a screen shot of the whole screen or just a window? <comment109827> Whole screen not window.
