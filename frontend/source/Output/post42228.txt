iMac as PS3 Screen <body> I was considering getting a PS3 and I'm planning to connect it to my 27" iMac (late 2009 model). What is the best way to connect the two?  UPDATE: Considering the price of all the adapters and the fact that the PS3 doesn't support my iMac's resolution I decided to get an other display.  <answer42229> A HDMI to display port adapter should work with the iMac in question since it supports Target Display Mode.   Here is an example of an HDMI to Display Port adapter the StarTech HDMI to DisplayPort Active Converter. Lastly video wise you would need a display port to mini display port cable to plug into the iMac.  As for the audio you can use a optical audio cable from the PS3 optical audio out to the line in port on the back of the iMac.  Or you can use a Digital Audio To Analog Audio Converter such as this and a send the output to the iMac, amplifier, or computer speakers with the proper adapter cable.  strongWord of caution:/strong Depending on the speed of the active HDMI to DisplayPort converter, the audio and video may not be in sync.  strongNote:/strong that is will not work with  any iMac that has Thunderbolt since these macs can only provide DisplayPort output capabilities, and that may be spotty at best according to Thunderbolt port to mini Display-Port cable, where there were reports of graininess.   <answer42231> This YouTube video suggests that the Belkin AV360 can be used to connect a PS3 and an iMac. However, the AV360 seems pretty pricy - currently listed on the site at $149.99.  Another YouTube video shows a different solution - a HDMI to Mini Display Converter. However, the author noted that the Mini Display port only takes video, not audio, so not a perfect solution.  <comment47991> What about sound? <comment47993> Be aware that this might not work with a newer Thunderbolt iMac. <comment48152> Note for future reference this will not work on a Thunderbolt iMacs <comment48302> @MrDaniel, very good point...
