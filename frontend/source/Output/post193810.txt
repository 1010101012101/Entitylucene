With the new Apple Music app is there a way to sort my music by Album? <body> It seems that Apple have messed up sorting again in the new Apple Music app. I want to sort my music by Album Title, not by Artist and then Title. Is there a way to do this?  <answer193928> Yes!  I had the same problem.  Go to Settings → Music → Sort Albums and change this to By Title.  <comment231277> This is the answer. Thank you very much.
