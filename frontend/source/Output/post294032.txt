Error "Metric (TFM) file not found" with MacTex 2016 <body> I want to use TexMaker as LaTeX editor on a Macbook with OS X 10.9.5.  I installed TexMaker 4.5 and MacTex 2016.  A first attempt to compile a given document (that was written with TexMaker on a Linux computer) gives errors because some code.sty/code files are missing. So I looked for them on the internet and put them in the folder that contains my document.  A second attempt to compile the document gives following error:     Error ! Font U/psy/m/n/10=psyr at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.   I read on tex.SE [still searching the post] that this can be due to multiple LaTeX distributions being installed on your computer. I think that this can be the case. How can I check which versions are installed? Or could there be a different cause?  strongUpdate/strong  In codeusr/local/texlive/code there was a folder code2016/code and code2016basic/code. I removed the code2016/code folder but the problem persists.  strongUpdate 2/strong According to this question:     On macOS / MacTeX codeinstall collection-fontsrecommended/code in the TeX Live Utility or codetlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended/code from the command line.   I did the latter from the command line. It said     tlmgr: package repository http://ctan.cs.uu.nl/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: gnupg not available)      ===============================================================================      tlmgr itself needs to be updated.      Please do this via either      tlmgr update --self      or by getting the latest updater for Unix-ish systems:      http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.sh      and/or Windows systems:      http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet/update-tlmgr-latest.exe      Then continue with other updates as usual.      ===============================================================================      tlmgr: Terminating; please see warning above!   So I proceeded with codetlmgr update --self/code and it said     tlmgr: package repository       http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/pub/software/tex/systems/texlive/tlnet (not verified: gnupg not available)      tlmgr: saving backups to /usr/local/texlive/2016basic/tlpkg/backups   /Library/TeX/texbin/tlmgr: create(tlpkg/tlpobj/texlive.infra.tlpobj) failed: Permission denied at /usr/local/texlive/2016basic/tlpkg/TeXLive/TLPOBJ.pm line 561.   How to proceed?  <comment371187> The problem seemed to be caused by multiple versions of MacTex being installed. I removed them all and reinstalled one version. <comment371188> This question will probably be deleted.
