Is there a shortcut key to bring up the Launch Pad on an older apple keyboard? <body> It's a white iMac, I think perhaps 2007 model. Here is the keyboard currently:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o8wIW.png" alt="enter image description here"  There is one that works for Mission Control, but not for Launch Pad.  Do you think there is a way to configure one to work?  <answer57633> Check in emSystem Preferences  Mission Control/em what key is assigned for Launchpad. You can customize the settings of course.  Note that per default pressing kbdF11/kbd for example will work as a media key (change volume in your case). So you need to press kbdfn/kbd+kbdF11/kbd instead.  <answer57635> You could simply configure a shortcut of your liking for it in:  emSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Launchpad &amp; Dock/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Da9e9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment66233> I like this even better :) <comment66235> @gentmatt: haha perfect :)
