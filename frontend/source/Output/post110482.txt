What is the Best App to Create Gifs? <body> I have photoshop CC but it feels a bit limited.  If I want to turn a video into a gif I can, or if I want to move things around I can but what is used to create flash type effects? like bending lines or if I wanted to create animated characters what are some apps I can check out?  <answer110485> Check out Hype. It doesn't do GIFs, it does HTML5 animation. But it will give you a Flash-like timeline to create vector animations that are cross-browser compatible.  <comment130172> can it be converted to gifs? anything else i shoudl consider?
