Share the clipboards automatically when using Apple Screen Sharing? <body> Is it possible to share the clipboard of my local machine and a remote machine automatically when using OS X's built-in Screen Sharing utility? The whole Edit - Send Clipboard, Edit - Get Clipboard routine starts to feel a little cumbersome if you're doing any regular copy and paste work between your local desktop and a remote session.  <answer8465> Maybe you might want to switch to emJollysFastVNC/em, which supports pasteboard sync out of the box: http://www.jinx.de/JollysFastVNC.html  Note that it is not free of charge. You can also get it in the Mac App Store, where the home version (up to 7 computers) costs US-$ 9.99.  <answer8485> Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like the clipboard can be shared automatically. However, instead of going Edit-Send Clipboard and Edit-Get Clipboard, you can use the get/send clipboard buttons:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjU4L.png" alt="enter image description here"  They're usually hidden by default, but you can get them to appear by clicking this button in the upper right hand corner of the window: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F6hUr.png" alt="enter image description here" or going View-Show Toolbar  <answer174487> This feature seems to now exist in Apple Screen Sharing Version 1.5 (481.1)  codeEdit &gt; Use Shared Clipboard/code  Or codeView &gt; Show Toolbar/code and then select codeUse Shared Clipboard/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KHPok.png" alt="Use Shared Clipboard"  <comment9079> I [just went through getting Screen Sharing to work for me so I could cut JollysFastVNC out of my workflow](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5966/mac-to-mac-screen-sharing-doesnt-work-just-hangs). :) If possible I'd like to not go back to a paid VNC solution. Plus, I do like that CMD+key combos work with OS X's Screen Share (it never did with JollysFast for me).
