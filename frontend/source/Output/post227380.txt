Teh iPad runs on strongios 8/strong and teh battery is never changed.  <answer227388> The problem is mostly the charger. Buy the official Apple one (the $20 one) and the iPad should charge emmuch/em faster. Also, updating to iOS 9 couldn't hurt, either.  <comment276146> We need some more info: Are you using an Apple-branded charger? What about the USB cable? Was the battery ever replaced? If so, by whom? Was it dropped or water-damaged recently? What version of iOS is it running? <comment276150> Ok red eagle the iPad _charges_ with a third party cable and usb charger it was only dropped on the bed 3 times only the iPad is running in iOS 8.3-8.4.1 <comment276227> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35270/iphone-4-will-charge-in-wall-but-wont-sync-or-charge-via-usb
