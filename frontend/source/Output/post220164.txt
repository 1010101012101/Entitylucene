4th Gen AppleTV - multiple logins vs shared login <body> I've just purchased the 4th gen AppleTV.   One thing I've noticed is that switching user accounts could be a lot easier.   For example, if my wife would like to listen to music associated with her AppleID, it appears she would need to go to Settings  Accounts  iCloud  then select her ID from here, etc etc.  While not a deal breaker, it's unfortunate there isn't a better way.      In any case...  rather than switch back and forth between accounts all day, I'm wondering if it would make more sense to create a "shared" account and add that to our "family", so that the AppleTV could sit on the shared account instead.     My question related to that...  are there any pros / cons that you are aware of in doing so?    <comment266848> +1 for the intriguing question.  In my family, I'm the only one who usually buys items, so my acct is logged into ATV.  But, I don't think I can see the purchased items other family members, although they have 100 songs vs. my 30,000, so it's kind of hard to see if theirs were in there.
