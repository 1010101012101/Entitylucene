Possibility to install ML directly from the hard disk? <body> Does it possible to install Mountain Lion (clean install) without using USB key or DVD?  I'm currently running on SL, and I want install ML (I already have the dmg file).  <answer97564> If you boot into the strongRecovery HD/strong (kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbdR/kbd or kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd then select Recovery), you can open strongDisk Utility/strong and strongErase/strong the internal drive.  Then close Disk Utility and use the strongReinstall/strong option in OS X Utilities to reinstall OS X.  <comment114470> Sorry I wasn't clear.
