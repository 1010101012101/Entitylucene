Up Arrow Key Shows Application Windows (without having set it up as a shortcut) <body> I'm using OS X Yosemite 10.10.1 and whenever I press my up arrow key, mission control will display the application windows while also performing whatever action the up key is expected to (e.g. move the cursor up in a text field).    I checked the mission control and keyboard preferences and made sure that the up key wasn't mapped to any shortcut. When I found that there was no problem there, I tried unchecking the "application windows" shortcut in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Mission Control then tried pressing the up key and it played the alert sound and still performed the expected action.br Then I went to System Preferences  Mission Control and found that there's no way to even map the up key to a shortcut there.    So I'm really confused as to where this shortcut is set and it is a really annoying problem, anybody know where how this could be happening despite not being set in System Preferences? Is this simply a bug that has been/will be resolved in an updatebr (it seems like too major of a problem to make its way into a release though)?  <comment189063> Have you checked Accessibility settings? I'm not sure, but it could be set there. <comment189106> I didn't see anything involving mission control shortcuts so I don't think so.
