⌘T does not open a new tab <body> In Finder under the File menu, the "New Tab" command has ⌘T as a keyboard shortcut. However, when I use those combination of keys, a new tab does not open. I am currently running Yosemite, but this was also the case when I was running Mavericks. Is there a fix or workaround for this?  <answer163468> I noticed mine didn't either under Mavericks 10.9.5.    Open System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts tab, Select App shortcuts  Click the code+/code button and under codeApplication:/code select codeFinder.app/code, under codeMenu Title/code enter codeNew Tab/code and under codeKeyboard Shortcut/code enter code⌘T/code.  After that in an open Finder window code⌘T/code opens a new tab.   <comment191459> I added the keyboard shortcut, but it still doesn't work.
