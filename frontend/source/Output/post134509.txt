My Mac account is completely blocked <body> I recently had some problem with my account that I use on a regular basis.  After logging in, my Mac blocks completely showing the spinning color wheel everywhere I click to open something. Finally I need to restart my mac, because I'm not able to do anything. Now, the strange thing is that this does not happen when I log in into another account on my mac, then is everything working fine.   Anyone that knows how an issue like this?  My mac is on Mac OS X Mavericks and is a Macbook Pro Mid-2010.  <answer134511> Here are some choices I suggest:  ul liOne is to move all the stuff from the broken account to the working one, then delete the broken account. Make the new one account the administrator account./li liThe second option is to repair the broken account.  ol liRestart Computer, and before you hear the chime, hold down the Command and R keys./li liYou’ll be at the Repair Utilities screen. Click the Utilities item in the Menu Bar, then click Terminal./li liIn the Terminal window, type coderesetpassword/code and hit Return./li liThe password reset utility window launches, but you’re strongnot going to reset the password/strong. Instead, click on icon for your Mac’s hard drive at the top. From the dropdown below it, select the user account where you’re having issues./li liAt the bottom of the window, you’ll see an area labeled Reset Home Directory Permissions and ACLs. Click the Reset button there./li /ol/li /ul  The reset process takes just a couple of minutes. When it’s done, exit the programs you’ve opened and restart your Mac.  Source  strongUPDATE:/strong since you want to try to repair that account and based on you console log:  Analyzing your log it shows:  ul liSMC errors, so reset your SMC/li liDisk I/O errors (not so good news) try to repair it in Terminal with code/sbin/fsck -fy/code/li liRecommend to disable all and any Sharing settings (in System Preferences) /li /ul  Postscriptum:  Your used profile so massively messed up, I do not know what was done to it, but I would create a new profile and just copy files over.  <answer134530> You could try to login in without starting login items and opening finder windows. You can do this by holding down the kbdSHIFT/kbd key after you type your username and password at the login screen.  This will probably only solve simple problems with your login.

And I really want to avoid doing your first choice, maybe you have another option in mind? <comment159711> Holding SHIFT when logging in did nothing for me... <comment159733> yes, for that show me your console log about 30 lines <comment159820> My log is pasted [here](http://pastebin.com/Ge6MVsL7). It is between two boots in which I logged into my account that freezes my mac.
