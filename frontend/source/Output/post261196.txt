Chrome won't open iTunes desktop links <body> I used to be able to click through to the iTunes App Store on my Mac by clicking a link in Chrome, but now it just hangs on a "Connecting to the iTunes Store..." page. What to do?  <answer261197> Navigate to your Chrome user data:  ul liOn Mac: code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome//code/li liOn Windows: codeC:\Users\&lt;USER NAME&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\/code/li /ul  In the codeLocal State/code file, remove the entry between commas that mentions codeitmss/code (e.g., code"itmss":true,/code)â€”this will reset the iTunes link handler. Now you can check "Remember my choice" the next time Chrome goes to open an iTunes link.  <answer284910> As of Chrome 58 on macOS, this setting is in a file called codePreferences/code in the relevant profile folder for your Chrome application files. In other words, something along the lines of:  ul licode~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Preferences/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile1/Preferences/code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile2/Preferences/code/li /ul  depending on whether or not you have multiple user profiles and which one you are using.  Inside that file, search for codeitmss/code and change the entry to false so that Chrome opens iTunes links, in other words:  code"itmss":false,/code  The equivalent entry for the Mac AppStore is codemacappstores/code, i.e.:  code"macappstores":false,/code  Before making this change, be sure to:  ul liquit Chrome/li limake a copy of the original file in case things get messed up/li /ul  <comment355850> itmss appears to no longer be in Local State. Or at least it's not in there for me. Tested with 58.0.3029.81 (64-bit)
