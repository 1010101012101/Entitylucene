Best USB hub to match the Thunderbolt display? <body> I just got a spanking new Apple Thunderbolt Display to work with my Macbook Air and I'm  loving it. The one thing I'm missing from my iMac is the 4 USB ports at the back (the Thunderbolt display only has 3). I realize I can use the 2 USB ports on the MBA but it's just not very convenient (plus I don't like the idea of a laptop being bogged down by earthly constraints such as a dangling phone charger cable).    I'm looking for a USB hub with the following features:  ul ligood-looking (admittedly subjective)/li lican hide behind the display that I'd use to plug in the immobile equipment such as scanner, wireless dongles, etc./li liIdeally, no AC power needed (but I get the feeling I won't be able to be too picky on this one)./li /ul  Is there hardware out there that meets these requirements? If your answer includes a link please link to manufacturers' sites, not to sales sites, which change more frequently.  <answer39497> There's always the various Mac mini stackable USB hubs - those usually look pretty nice.  If you can't find a hub you like the looks of, you could always hide it:  ul liA shelf that goes on the monitor stand to hide items behind the monitor/li liOr you could just tape (or velcro, thanks to @jaberg) the hub to the back of the monitor to keep it out of sight./li /ul  <comment49013> While "shopping questions" are off-topic at Stack Exchange sites, questions asking about what hardware can perform a desired function are very much on-topic. This post seems to fall into the latter category. See http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/ for more details. <comment49020> Velcro, or even better the hard plastic Velcro-like material, is great for sticking things behind monitors. I use it for the digital converter boxes on wall-mounted TVs and plan to do so for a future TV/AppleTV installation.
