VLC subtitles: Why do I get these weird characters? <body> When I load a subtitles file with VLC I get these weird characters:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vSvPM.png" alt="enter image description here"  This doesn't happen with other subtitles files, so I was wondering what's this different encoding. The file is included in the mkv format, so I can't open it with a text editor.  <comment160081> Always with MKV? Or just this particular file? <comment160112> That is the Apple last resort font.  It appears when for some reason the app cannot access the particular font designated.  Sometimes trashing font caches can help.
