Why does this AppleScript not run in Outlook? <body> I would like set up an inbound rule in Outlook to run applescript on certain messages.  However the rule fails with the following message:  precodeWhile processing message "Test" (ID 39523), the rule "untitled" could not be successfully executed. An unknown error has occurred in Outlook. /code/pre  I've tried with scripts that different things, such as displaying a dialog in another application:  precodeTell application "Adobe Illustrator" to display dialog "hallo" /code/pre  or in Outlook itself:  precodeTell application "Microsoft Outlook" to display dialog "hallo" /code/pre  or do a shell action:  precodedo shell script "touch /Users/cesansim/Desktop/iamapony.txt" /code/pre  and all of them work OK when launched from the command line via osascript, but do not from within Outlook.  Also, other actions (for example setting the message to read) run by rules work OK. Is it possible that on my corporate Mac there's a security setting blocking AppleScript? And how do I turn that off?  Thanks.  <answer129871> The script does not get recognized by Outlook as such because it has been saved as text (I created it inside Aquamacs).  If I open it in the AppleScript Editor and export it as script, then it works.  I found the solution here (third message from the top)  <comment152032> Your post is very vague.  Have you tried different scripts?  All scripts fail?  What's the goal of your script? <comment152100> are you on a server outlook?
