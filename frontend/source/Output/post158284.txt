What does Holding Home Button on Power Off Screen do? <body> When you hold the home button on the power off screen of an iDevice on the lockscreen or Springboard, what is it supposed to do?  <answer158287> If you continue to hold, you get Siri [iPhone 4S &amp; up]; even from the power-down screen…    …otherwise, you trigger fingerprint security, which requires you to touch but not press the home button from the lock screen to unlock the device [iPhone 5S &amp; up].
