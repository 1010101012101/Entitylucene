Wifi Connction Problems <body> I'm having a WiFi sharing problem.   I'm using my ipad air as a hotspot for my mac osx leporad (which has a airport card). My mac recognizes my ipad but when I click on it nothing happens. so I went to system presences and tried to add a network there and when I get to enter your password, I do that and it says connection timed out or password invaild......(Which I know the password it right)  If my mac can detect my ipad hotspot why won't my mac connect to it????? Anyone please help me! Also I have a Mac OS X 10.5   Thankx  <answer146648> To set up a hot spot on your iPad, start by opening Settings and navigating to General  Network. (Note: you will need to have the Cellular Data connection turned on.)  You can set up your personal hot spot by tapping on the giant setup button, which will strongcheck with your carrier to see if the feature is supported/strong, and if it is, allow you to turn the hot spot on. If your carrier doesn't support it, you'll get an alert telling you as much.   Enter a password that has to be minimum 8 characters long.  <comment172766> Okay. I have my ipad already on a hotspot. I'am just trying to figure out how to connect my mac to it. <comment172767> Just making sure you have a type of network provider that allows you to share the connection. Double check the password settings on iPad. <comment172785> Okay. Im trying that now. <comment172788> didnt work. I cant change password on ipad. <comment172798> You can change your Wi-Fi password by tapping Settings  Personal Hotspot or Settings  Cellular  Personal Hotspot and then tapping the Wi-Fi password.
