BootCamp is a 'utility' to allow Windows to be legitimately installed on Apple hardware.  <answer143042> Boot Camp is an application where you can install Windows OS onto your Mac OS X very easily. It's basically an compatible application which allows you to install Windows 7/8 on your Mac OS X hard drive partition. If you want to use BootCamp and install Windows 7/8 you can read this thread and you will know just a bit more of bootcamp and how to install windows onto it.   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3986  If your a first time user with Mac OS X you might need to do a couple of things before installing Mac OS X Snow Leopard onto your hard drive. When you start up the DVD into boot options, there should be like a Utilities button and then Disk Utility up on the Menu Bar. This is what it looks like.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X9G73.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's very easy to install from there. When Disk Utility is open you need to follow this step to clear your hard drive and do a clean install. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtxOa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Then quit Disk Utility and clean install Snow Leopard, it's that easy! img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iElDt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment168487> He also asks how to install Mac OS X. I think we can cover that here.. <comment168489> FYI, OP is trying to install OS X on a PC <comment168491> Not on a 'PC' we can't. <comment168499> @tetsujin is it illegal to install it on PC? <comment168505> We might be pushing the definition of "illegal" [civil vs criminal] but it's certainly not sanctioned by Apple & is specifically excluded by their end user licence.
