corestorage failure: missing disk, how to recover data? <body> This morning, my iMac show me the prohibit sign. After hours of struggling, I'm facing this: the Mac does not want to boot up. I have a lot of recent files to recover, but have this issue:  precoderoot# diskutil info disk0s2 Device Identifier:        disk0s2 Device Node:              /dev/disk0s2 Part of Whole:            disk0 Device / Media Name:      iMac HDD Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system) Mounted:                  Not applicable (no file system) File System:              None Partition Type:           Apple_CoreStorage OS Can Be Installed:      No Recovery Disk:            disk0s3 Media Type:               Generic Protocol:                 SATA SMART Status:             Verified Disk / Partition UUID:    0F0B3B70-6807-47A4-BED7-0BD2B77E4F51 Total Size:               998.7 GB (998695010304 Bytes) (exactly 1950576192 512-Byte-Units) Volume Free Space:        Not applicable (no file system) Device Block Size:        512 Bytes Read-Only Media:          No Read-Only Volume:         Not applicable (no file system) Ejectable:                No Whole:                    No Internal:                 Yes Solid State:              No  This disk is a Core Storage Physical Volume (PV).

I've read some things about rewriting the MBR and/or GPT. Is this the way to recover my datas?  If I do a disk dump (dd) of this disk, then perform a fresh re-install, is there any change I'll can open the disk dump afterward? I've seen things using Apple "ars" tool, but, I'm not sure it'll help.  Any ideas?  Note: from a hardware point of view, the disk is ok, I can do a codedd if=/dev/disk0 of=/dev/null/code without any errors.  <answer234919> Your CoreStorage Logical Volume Group is missing a Physical Volume with the UUID DDD40234-2DC7-44B2-BE95-D9C0FA46F96A.  Your internal drive probably is (or worse: was) a Fusion Drive and the SSD part is missing. The SSD is either damaged or has to be reseated, if it doesn't show up entering codediskutil list/code or if it shows up: the internal structure of the LVG got corrupted.  A Fusion Drive works similar as a RAID0: 2 (or more) disks occur as one: The whole file system spans over two or more disks. One big difference of a Fusion Drive is that files often aren't sliced and therefore either reside on the SSD or the HDD. Depending on the file type and the access frequency or last access time the "less important" files are relocated to the HDD part. The file system files (e.g. catalog file) and most system files usually reside on the SSD part.  You may try to codedd/code disk0s2 to an external drive (either as partition or as raw file to an existing volume) and inspect it with a decent file recovery tool. If you enabled FileVault previously the data can't be recovered.  Rewriting the GPT (or MBR) doesn't help at all or on the contrary: it makes things worse.  hr  If you have further questions leave a comment.  <comment287249> Try a dd, work on the copy, and simply remove the missing PV entry.
