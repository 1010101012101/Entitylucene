How to list bluetooth devices from command line <body> I have to list all available bluetooth devices from command line. I tried to google it, but got only results like "how to turn on bluetooth from terminal".  Simply: bluetooth scan  Thanks for help in  advance.  <answer132421> Simply typing in:  precodeblued /code/pre  Will return a list of paired devices according to to the link key. I don't know how to have it exit cleanly, so to return to the prompt you will need to press kbdControl/kbd+kbdc/kbd  <comment155724> by available you mean paired ? or do you mean Bluetooth scan ? <comment155733> would this work for you http://stackoverflow.com/a/11682731/2241562 <comment155760> Bluetooth scan. <comment155762> would you use the same command for devices scan (not paired) <comment155795> @Buscar웃 Honestly not sure. When I run it, it shows a few other key values of other devices I own which aren't linked -but bluetooth enabled. It's hard to identify the devices themselves based on the output though - looks almost like MAC addresses (though its not). Thanks for pointing out that distinction. <comment155796> @Buscar웃 I'm not sure if the additional listings were previously connected devices though, or ones resulting from an active scan. <comment155797> I tried yours and it did show previously paired devices on my mac (that are currently not connected). I do not think it does the active scan for all surrounding BT devices. <comment155798> @Buscar웃 the other alternative is it shows available devices which aren't paired but which *were previously* and are currently available (and thus, have already established a link key with the MBP). I agree though - I don't believe this shows a full scan of all available devices (that being - including those which weren't previously paired). <comment329560> this q/a seems a bit confusing - does `bluetooth scan` list all nearby devices that are discoverable or does the answer below by njboot return that?
