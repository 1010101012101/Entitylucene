I'm getting a connection timed out error with SVN after installing OS X Yosemite <body> Yesterday I updated OS X to Yosemite from Mavericks.  Today, any time I try to execute commands in SVN (no matter which client I use, including command-line), I get the following error:  codesvn: E175012: Unable to connect to a repository at URL '&lt;correct path&gt;' svn: E175012: Connection timed out/code  This happens with all of my repos.  There is no delay that would indicate a time out, the error returns immediately.  If I browse to the repo path in Chrome it loads successfully.  I've updated Xcode to code6.0.1/code and the command line tools as well.  When I call codewhich svn/code I get: code/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/svn/code  <answer151117> The problem was the client I normally use (Versions) has a crash bug in Yosemite.  The fix for that, which I carried out yesterday, is here: Versions crashing in OS X Yosemite  That fix has the side effect of breaking SVN (but it stops the Versions crashes!).  Reverting the change gets rid of the error message I was seeing.
