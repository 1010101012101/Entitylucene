Apple OS Update and SSD failed last time I tried <body> I have a MacMini that is running 10.7.5.  This is a Mid-2011 MacMini.  I installed a SSD in my MacMini about a year ago.  When I put the SSD in, the Mini was already running Lion.  I installed the SSD, then I updated to Mountain Lion - this was very close to the release date of ML. When my update finished the MacMini would not boot.  It would hang on the Blue Screen. The only way the Mini would work is if I left the OS in 10.7.5.  This is my Work machine so I couldn't afford the downtime to fix it.  Now some apps I use require Mountain Lion. I figure enough time has passed that maybe Crucial or Apple has figured out what went wrong.   Can I now update to ML safely?   And also - should I enable TRIM?  I've seen people say no regarding crucial drives but I'd rather get an educated answer before I try anything.  <comment124149> Mark Thalman - thanks for editing that... I"m new here so I appreciate the lesson :) <comment124150> Welcome Bryan! I can't see the exact cause here so can't reassure whether safe to update to Mountain Lion (or perhaps Mavericks soon?).  But I do have a suggestion for troubleshooting a hang on blue screen: try booting in verbose mode (see Apple's [HT1492](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) document)... the last line printed before the hang *may* indicate the problem (or it might be a red herring, but it's worth a try...) <comment124163> Ashley - thanks.  I only remember finding some forum talk about early Mountain Lion not playing nice w/ non-apple SSDs.  I appreciate your feedback. <comment124295> What model SSD do you have? Did you ever try a clean install of Mountain Lion? (And yes I would enable trim.) <comment138361> I got this all sorted out using chameleon trim enabler and I think os x is now playing nice with non-intel ssds.  Thanks to everyone for the help.
