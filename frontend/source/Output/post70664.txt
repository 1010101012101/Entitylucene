Newsstand magazine downloads very slow and halting <body> My newsstand has two subscriptions: New Yorker and Economist.     ol liWhen a new issue is available for strongeither/strong one of those, the period required to download the issue is super slow, and unreliable - it will seem to spin along well, showing the download numbers increase, but then simply halt. The iPad will then go to its lock screen, and when I go back, zero additional downloading will have progressed in the meantime. In fact, sometimes it pops strongback/strong to the previous downloaded amount prior to the last little progress session./li liI have "download automatically" set in the preferences for Newsstand for these subscriptions. It doesn't do it on its own (and, as above, barely does it when I ask it to specifically). /li /ol  Note:  ul liYes, I have done the "show the currently running apps and then fully close down the NYer and Newssstand apps all the way" method - does not help… and I've shut down the iPad all the way and restarted, also./li liI live in Thailand, but I'm on a pretty fast DSL and the Wi-Fi is fine… jeez, in these times, overseas location doesn't matter, right?/li /ul  Anyone have these problems strongor/strong have a guess?   supThe iPad is the iPad 3, has the newest iOS as of today (Nov 2012), etc…/sup  <answer71996> Your location doesn't matter, what matters is having a connection to the Apple service.

This can get upset and give you content from a server a long way from you under certain circumstances.  To check this out first visit http://whatismyipaddress.com/ or some such which will translate your IP address back to a location.  Second, the CDN uses DNS trickery to send you to the nearest server so make sure you are using the DNS recommended by your ISP.  This may fix your problem.  <answer212600> If you're using a vpn turn it off. I did and it fixed the slow download problem  <comment82034> I'm not sure if this is applicable for Newsstand downloads, but in these days location still matters a lot, unless content is transparently distributed on localized servers.
