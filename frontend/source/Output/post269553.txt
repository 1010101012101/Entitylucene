Understand Finder Find Results <body> I am looking in a folder for a file which contains codepath/code in its name. I enter codepath/code in the search box, and select it to search the current folder (which is my default anyway). The tool tip indicates codeFilenames/code codeName matches: path/code.  What I see is 110 items, none of which even contain the string codepath/code, let alone match.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mzx4.png" alt="enter image description here"  What does the finder think I am looking for, and what do the results actually mean?  This is a relatively new iMac running MacOS Sierra.   <answer269694> There are two issues here: by default, Finder will:  ul lisearch the contents of files as well as their names /li lisearch either your entire Mac hard disk, or the current folder emand/em all its subfolders./li /ul  To solve the first problem, you need to to tell Finder just to match filenames. When you typed "path" into the search box, a dropdown menu should have appeared, with the option "Name matches: path". Select that, instead of just pressing Enter. Alternatively, you can type codename:path/code into the search box, which has the same effect.  You can't really solve the second problem with Finder; even when restricting the search to the current folder, there is no way to exclude its sub-folders. For that, you'll need a third-party tool, or learn to use commands in the Terminal like codels *path*/code.  <answer271286> ol liIn the Finder, use command-F to get a Finder search window.  You will get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFWm1.jpg" alt=""/li liThere is now a bar with criteria added.  You see a pop-up menu "Kind" followed by "is" and another pop-up menu "Any".  Click the "Kind", and choose "Name" from that menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7iZEJ.jpg" alt=""/li liThere now is a pop-up menu just following "Name", select "contains" from that, and type the word "path" in the field that follows./li liYou can add criteria by clicking the + sign at the right of the search bar./li /ol  Spotlight does seem to "power" the default search field in Finder windows.  I use Spotlight only in desperation, as it almost never ever finds what I'm looking for.  But with the search criteria in the Finder's search window I usually book success.  So, remember:  command-F gets you a Finder search window with a criteria bar, and that certainly helps.  <answer271287> You can also add criteria to the pop-up list.  A useful one is the file extension.  E.g. here is the result for a search for all files that are images with file extension jpeg (not jpg) opened in the last 3 weeks: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShJe9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment338766> Picture of the search might help [suitably anonymised in photoshop if needs be]. A lot depends on where the search is & how finely the parameters are specified. If you actually need 'hard' searching then Spotlight is not the best tool; it's a bit too 'user friendly'. There are alternatives, command line or UI-based. If you can edit your question to clarify, answers will be easier to provide. <comment338810> As you see in the screen capture, a particular folder was selected. The question is why do all of those results appear which do _not_ contain the search string `path`? <comment338811> @Tetsujin I have added an image. I am aware of other tools, which I do use regularly. The question is what do the results mean? <comment338812> Yes, sorry: just re-edited answer to cover that. <comment338813> I already had `Name matches: path`, but I didn’t know about the `name:path` technique. It didn’t help either. <comment338814> Ok... you didn't have 'name matches path' selected in your screenshot, as that would [look like this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1802478/stackexchange-spotlight.png). But if you're doing that now, I don't have any other ideas :/
