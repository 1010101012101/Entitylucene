Create iCloud Mail account without an Apple device <body> I have already an Apple ID through iTunes. I am a Windows user and have no Apple devices, but would like to have an iCloud.com email address.  How can I do that?  <answer239504> I googled around and no answer about this problem, the condition you can create iCloud email address is you own an Apple device. On an iOS device, go to Settings  iCloud, turn on Mail, then follow the onscreen instructions. On a Mac, choose Apple menu  System Preferences, click iCloud, select Mail, then follow the onscreen instructions.  <comment293925> Don't think so, as that only addresses it if you have an Apple device. To my knowledge, however, you can't do it anyways if you don't have an Apple device, so there's that.
