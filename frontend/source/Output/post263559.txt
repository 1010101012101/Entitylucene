Sudden display/screen issue with Macbook 2013. Screen has turned a dim washed-out yellow. <body> Two photos are below. I was playing League of Legends, and as soon as I exited I experienced this problem. There was no other change of conditions except closing the game. I've tried shutting off, restarting, and rebooting to no avail. I've also tried calibrating the display. Has anyone experienced this problem?  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)  2.4 GHz Intel Core i5  8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3  Intel Iris 1536 MB  img src="https://i.imgur.com/cQIHDXgr.jpg" alt="Photo 1" [Photo 1]  img src="https://i.imgur.com/EGUDAk3r.jpg" alt="Photo2" [Photo 2]  <comment330204> It's, uh... It seems to have fixed itself completely. I have no idea why, or even why it started in the first place. Weird.
