Delete hidden books from iTunes <body> I'm cleaning up my iTunes library. I'm a programmer so, with the help of some nifty scripting, I'm using codeiTunes Music Library.xml/code to give me improved insight into my iTunes library.  In the process, I've discovered there are several books lingering in my library which I can't see in the iTunes application. I've also found the book files sitting in codeiTunes Media/code.  I can't for the life of me figure out how to delete these books from my library, considering I can't find them in the application. Any ideas?  strongNote:/strong I'm running iTunes 12.3.2.35 on Windows 10. My library was moved from an old Mac (packed away but can dig it out if software version numbers available if required).  <answer228435> strongSELF ANSWER:/strong  On Windows, books emshould/em have been available from the iTunes application but, for whatever reason, they weren't for me. So, I ended up moving my iTunes library back to a Mac running OS X 10.11.  On OS X, it appears that all books functionality has been moved from iTunes to the iBooks application. I opened iBooks and it immediately offered to move books from iTunes. I then deleted the books from iBooks. After closing both iTunes and iBooks, an inspection of codeiTunes Music Library.xml/code shows that all the books "tracks" have been removed from my iTunes library.
