Macbook Pro (Late 2015) running Mac OS Sierra unresponsive to keyboard at time and has loud fan noises <body> Since a few weeks I have some strange issues with my 2015 MacBook pro (running the latest Mac OS Sierra):  ul liSometimes after I wake the PC or just start it, my keyboard doesn't respond (and external keyboard does work). SCM- and PRAM-resets don't work. But after starting repair-mode, without actually doing anything or running Diagnostic mode, it works again./li /ul  emThe Diagnostic mode does not find any issues, except the recommendation to reset the SCM./em  ul liAnother, more annoying issue is that the fans often blow very loud. I am aware that there are a lot of different post here and on other websites with this issue, but I can't really find one describing my exact issue: the CPU is low (&lt; 5%), memory usage is also low (&lt;25% of the 16GB) and also the temperature of the CPU is quite low. So to me it seems no processes are hanging and the temperature sensor is working fine. The strange thing is that it works sometimes. Sometimes on a start the fans are acting normal, but sometimes after a while the fans start to slow down, like a heavy process is finished./li /ul  What I've tried:  ul liRunning the diagnostics: no issues/li liResetting SCM: sometimes helps/li liResetting PRAM: no effect/li liReinstalling the Mac (with keeping my home folder): did seem to have effect, but after a few days the issue was (again of still?) there./li /ul  I'm not sure if both issues are related, but I for me it doesn't seem to be coincidence, cause both issues started almost at the same time.  Can anyone tell me what possibly causes this issue and what else I can try to fix it?  Thanks in advance.  <comment332327> What happens when you boot into Safe Mode? To start in Safe Mode, hold down the Shift key while your MBP boots up. Do this and use your computer for long enough to know if the problem persists. <comment332340> In safe mode it also blows loud, so there seems no difference between safe mode and regular mode.
