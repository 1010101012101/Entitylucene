music downloaded from Itunes to Iphone 6 now won't play <body> My Iphone 6 has my music library downloaded, I ensure that any music I purchase is downloaded to the phone, I recently purchased some more music.  Yesterday I listened to various tracks from my music collection including mainly the new purchases, now I notice that only the new purchases are downloaded to the phone and all the remainder of my music (including stuff I listened to yesterday) has mysteriously evaporated into the cloud (still shows on my phone but needs the internet to play) I'm working on a boat with no internet for a month what is going on!!!   <comment287177> now I notice that I need to connect to the internet to play some music that is downloaded to my Iphone but not other music (equally downloaded) why is this ?
