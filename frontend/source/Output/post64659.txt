What are some unique iPhone 5 features in iOS 6? <body> Rules:  ul liOne feature per answer./li liCheck if a feature has been posted already./li liOnly post things you are sure about./li /ul  The goal is to not have a one line answer or link and also not an essay of 500 words for each feature. Expect your answer to be edited ruthlessly if needed and deleted if a duplicate.  <answer64661> Clicking photos while recording video is only available on iPhone 5.  <comment75948> As this is a discussion, make this question a community wiki. <comment75959> Let's try editing this a bit so we can re-open it. Is this intended to list all the hardware features of iPhone 5 and be a broad survey or is this really a niche - does the fast processor allow some extra stuff that can't run on slower hardware? Viz., Siri wasn't on iPad 3 at hw launch - imagine this question back then. Now siri is on that hardware. This type (and specific) question invite so much speculation it's hard to see it getting an objective or even useful answer. This sort of thing works better asking what review covers this topic rather than calling to assemble that review here. <comment75960> Isn't this a hardware feature of the new ISP that controls the CCD in the camera? _(to wit. my point above about we don't really know what was a software issue, hardware issue, capacity issue, server-side issue, or marketing issue)_ If we edit this to just focus on the features without guessing why it might be better off for the site. <comment75969> It would be better to focus on iPhone 5 exclusive features regardless of them being hardware or software features. <comment75978> So - we'll need people (like you perhaps) to edit the question according to the closed notice above and your thoughts here - then link to it in chat - see if enough people vote to reopen it. If that's not possible, you can always flag it for reopening once it's had some changes to make it better / more constructive.
