Command Not found upon opening Terminal <body> When I open a new terminal, I get the following:  precodeLast login: Sun Jun  1 16:39:07 on ttys000 -bash: Setting: command not found NAME-OF-COMPUTER-MacBook-Pro:~ name$  /code/pre  I am used to seeing the first and the third lines, but the second seems new. How do I fix this?  EDIT  After executing codebash -x -l/code as Ian C. requested, this is the output:  precode+ '[' -x /usr/libexec/path_helper ']' ++ /usr/libexec/path_helper -s + eval 'PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin";' export 'PATH;' ++ PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin ++ export PATH + '[' /bin/bash '!=' no ']' + '[' -r /etc/bashrc ']' + . /etc/bashrc ++ '[' -z '\s-\v\$ ' ']' ++ PS1='\h:\W \u\$ ' ++ shopt -s checkwinsize ++ '[' Apple_Terminal == Apple_Terminal ']' ++ '[' -z '' ']' ++ PROMPT_COMMAND='update_terminal_cwd; ' + Setting PATH for Python 2.7 bash: Setting: command not found + PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin + export PATH + PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin + export PATH + PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin + export PATH + PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin + export PATH ++ update_terminal_cwd ++ local 'SEARCH= ' ++ local REPLACE=%20 ++ local PWD_URL=file://Conner-Pikes-MacBook-Pro.local/Users/connerpike ++ printf '\e]7;%s\a' file://Conner-Pikes-MacBook-Pro.local/Users/connerpike /code/pre  Also, Do I need those four long lines for something that has to do with python? It looks unnecessary. Any help on that would be much appreciated also.  <answer132562> Something in your startup files is trying to call a command called codeSetting/code which isn't a command that exists. You can debug your start up files by running:  precodebash -x -l /code/pre  and watching the output -- you'll see all the commands that are being run on startup and hopefully spot the line where codeSetting/code is trying to be used as a command. If you want to post your startup files more help might be possible.     What do you mean by "startup files"?    When your codebash/code shell starts, it reads and executes a bunch of standard startup files to setup your environment. It usually starts with code/etc/profile/code and then everything in the code/etc/profile.d/*.sh/code directory. Then it moves on to the user-level code~/.bash_profile/code and code~/.bashrc/code files.  Based on the output you posted your problem is here:  precode++ '[' -z '' ']' ++ PROMPT_COMMAND='update_terminal_cwd; ' + Setting PATH for Python 2.7 bash: Setting: command not found /code/pre  You have the literal line:  precodeSetting PATH for Python 2.7 /code/pre  in one of the startup files. It should either be prefixed with codeecho/code or commented out with a code#/code character.  Try and find the file by running these commands in a Terminal:  precodegrep -H Setting /etc/bashrc /etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bashrc /code/pre  From the depth marker, the single code+/code in that output, it's in a top-level file, not something being sourced from one of them.  If that codegrep/code command matches it'll print the file name. Find the line and add a code#/code to the front of it to comment it out. For example, change:  precodeSetting PATH for Python 2.7 /code/pre  to:  precode# Setting PATH for Python 2.7 /code/pre  in the file where codegrep/code reports the line.  <comment157019> What do you mean by "startup files"? I have edited my post with the output from `bash -x -l`
