Archive script for Mail in Mountain Lion <body> I found this script on this site:  precodetell application "Mail"     selected messages of message viewer 1     move result to mailbox "[Gmail]/All Mail" of account "Gmail" end tell /code/pre  Is there a way to take the account of the selected message as an input? I have three different accounts and don't want three different scriptsâ€¦  Thanks!
