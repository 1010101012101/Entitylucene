$PATH looks corrupted, is my hunch about the fix right? <body> I'm looking at my $PATH  precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/Users/gpiuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/gpiuser/Library/Android/sdk/toolsHOME/.npm/bin /code/pre  And noting that last directory is not a directory. I'm guessing it should look like   precode      tools:Users/gpiuser/.npm/bin /code/pre  instead of  precode       toolsHOME/.npm/bin /code/pre  and that something went wrong with a node.js installation at some point.   So I look at my .bash_profile:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/MacGPG2/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin  export PATH=${PATH}:/Users/gpiuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/gpiuser/Library/Android/sdk/toolsHOME/.npm/bin export NODE_PATH=$HOME/.npm/lib/node_modules /code/pre  and I THINK I should correct the file to reflect the above change and run source ~.bash_profile  Am I right?  <answer272401> Your fix is missing a forward slash before Users, therefore code…tools:/Users/gpiuser/.npm/bin/code.  It seems code…tools:$HOME/.npm/bin/code was what was intended, but stating the literal path works too.  <comment342455> Phew, thanks.  That worked. <comment343375> You have posted `.bash_profile` so that we see line wraps where there are none.  I'm afraid to edit it because the source looks like `export` is on a separate line, which is a different error, but also an error.  Could you update to show the *precise* contents of this file as a code block, please? <comment343512> That is the code block -- and there is a line break between the lines PATH and export, even now, in the working file adjusted according to grgarside's solution. My $PATH variable is complete with both sets of directories listed above so I can't see how export on a separate line twould be an error. <comment343515> Have a look at this screen dump: http://i.stack.imgur.com/iMiTu.png -- using `` instead of a four-line indent marks your text as an excerpt, not as a code block, and that means it's reflown to my screen width. <comment345632> Gotcha. Four line indented now. <comment345635> So you really do have the `export` statements on separate lines?  That would produce a huge amount of `declare -x` output on your terminal when you log in.  (There should be no need to `export PATH` explicitly because it is already exported.  If you want `NPM_PATH` to be exported, you need to move the `export` to the beginning of the line where you assign it.)
