Set PATH variable so that it is detected in all applications, even outside terminal. (El Captain) <body> My code~/etc/path/code looks as follows:   precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  strongThe Problem:/strong  When I type codeecho $PATH/code into terminal, I get back:   precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  And this persists for every application started in the terminal. For instance, if I type codeemacs/code, and then do:   precodeM-x getenv PATH /code/pre  My output is:   precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  However, if I start up emacs using launchpad instead of terminal and once again enter codeM-x getenv PATH/code, my output is instead code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code.  As you can see my change to code~/etc/path/code, which was the addition of code/usr/local/bin/code, is missing.   strongAnother Example:/strong  I use a Firefox plugin called emvimperator/em which emulates vim functionality in Firefox. It has a feature that allows the user to edit webpage input in vim. However, this does not seem to work on OS X. On a hunch I type the command code!echo $PATH/code into vimperator and see the following: code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code. Of course, since the symlink called codegvim/code, which points to codemacvim/code, was created and placed into code/usr/local/bin/code by brew, this behavior makes sense. What I don't understand is why the codePATH/code is read the way it is.   strongSolutions that I have tried:/strong  ul liI have obviously restarted my machine. /li /ul  strongEDIT (As requested by now deleted comment):/strong  using codesysctl user.cs_path/code in the terminal brings up:    precodeuser.cs_path: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  <answer243333>  s Run this:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codelaunchctl setenv PATH "$PATH" /code/pre  /s  strongEDIT/strong: That no longer works. Use this with Bash instead:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"codeCURRENT="$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print PATH" ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist)" /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set PATH $CURRENT:/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe" ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist /code/pre  Then log out and log in again.  emNote/em: You may want to replace code$CURRENT:/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe/code with just a list of paths like code:/your/path/here:/another/path/maybe/code, but that is a bad idea becase it will erase all paths already stored.  This uses User Session Environment Variables.  <answer243946> The codeloginwindow/code process sets a user's environment. It sets the variables TMPDIR and PATH, consults Directory Services and sets SHELL HOME USER LOGNAME . PATH is set to code/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code unless modified by launchd (in the more current versions of OS X). This is the PATH variable available to the user's processes unless modified by that particular process (codecron/code as an example sets the PATH to code/bin:/usr/bin/code).  Terminal emulator applications start your shell as a login shell thus the PATH is modified by reading the various shell startup file. Any process started by your shell now inherits the new PATH variable. Other applications using a shell do not read any shell config files and use those environment variables available in the current environment. An application may modify the environment by using the codeLSEnvironment/code key in their codeInfo.plist/code.  As of Yosemite, you can change the PATH variable in the following form.  precodesudo launchctl config user path &lt;path&gt; /code/pre  in your case you want /usr/local/bin at the front of the path.  precodesudo launchctl config user path /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  codereboot/code your system and the new PATH will be set by codeloginwindow/code.  <comment299661> I tried both simply running the command, as well as adding it to both my .profile and .bash_profile. The PATH is still set to `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` in Eclipse, Vimperator (firefox), and Emacs. The strange thing is, if I use the option to execute a shell script in either Emacs or Vimperator, running `echo $PATH` gets me `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. However, running `launchctl getenv PATH` produces `/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`; I don't know how to execute a shell script in Eclipse. I restarted after I made the changes to my dot files of course. <comment299662> This is also what is displayed if I type `echo $PATH` in the terminal. <comment299663> What exactly is that command supposed to do? <comment299665> @Allan I did come across that command as well while googling for answers. Apparently it used to set environmental variables back in 10.8. Now it doesn't work. <comment299670> @fd0 Sure. I'm done, and this is the exact path that I have been getting. <comment299766> The command was supposed to notify launchctl about the new `PATH` variable, but apparently that doesn't work anymore. I updated my answer with a new solution.
