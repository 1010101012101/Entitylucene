How to make folders' modification date = the most recently changed file, recursively <body> Like most coders, I have hundreds of files organized within dozens of directories. I rely heavily on "date modified" for basic version control.  On a daily basis, while digging through my codebase for recently updated files, I think the same thought: Why, for the love of all that is binary, isn't the modification date of each folder always equal to the most recently modified file it contains (percolating up)?  Has anyone accomplished this, and if not, why is this not a thing?  <comment318095> Use spotlight to search - often you need to know when was the structure of the directory chnaged so that is what its modification date is. The date only can be one thing but you there are several things it could be so you need more dates <comment318105> Perhaps I wasn't clear. I'm talking about the filesystem, not a search feature. Neither terminal nor applications make good use of spotlight. What I think I need is a bot, some process that notices any change in modification date of any file, and percolates the modification date all the way up its directory chain. <comment318114> Basically, I'm looking for a dynamic, always running version of this: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1524/how-do-i-change-folder-timestamps-recursively-to-the-newest-file
