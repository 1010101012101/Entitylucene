Split Windows on Textmate <body> Textmate has been around for a while, I bought it in 2006. Is it possible to split windows horizontally and or vertically on Textmate nowadays? Probably someone out there made a kind of Plugin for this :-/ Like codeC-x 2/code when I'm on GNU Emacs to split horizontally or codeC-x 3/code to split vertically and have flexible control on each windows' width or code:split/code on ViM.  <answer17227> As far as I know this feature is still not possible. Mind you many people have discussed this and it is a very south-out feature http://wiki.macromates.com/Suggestions/GUI.  <answer17233> The only thing I could find is seandunn/window-buddy.tmbundle - GitHub:     Window Buddy is a bundle to add basic window management to TextMate      Sorry but... WORK IN PROGRESS!      Currently it's a bit rough and incomplete but the aim is to provide pseudo split window editing by using auxiliary windows in TextMate.   <comment311091> Any change in the last 5 years? :)
