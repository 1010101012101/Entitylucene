How can I skip the desktop while cycling through finder windows with cmd+`? <body> I often have to copy-paste files from 2 finder folders. I use the kbdcmd/kbd + kbd`/kbd shortcut. But it cycles through Window 1  Desktop  Window 2.  Is there a way to skip desktop?  <answer127788> Desktop is a folder, so cycling between active folder is an expected behavior in Finder. The only way to achieve what you want is to hide Desktop by entering the command below.  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop FALSE /code/pre  After this, cycling between window will happen to the folder you’ve opened. This suggestion is recommended only if you don’t use Desktop to place temporary files.  <answer127814> If your goal is to go back and forth between two windows several times in a row, you can alternate between kbd⌘/kbdkbd`/kbd and kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd`/kbd, which goes the other way round.  <comment149722> I use my desktop for temporary files, so I guess I won't be able to use it. <comment149724> How about trying Unclutter for Mac to place temporary files. This way you can maintain a clean desktop, while cycling between window smoothly. :) <comment149725> Completely forgot about CreateDesktop — oops :) <comment149770> Yes, it does work but hitting cmd+' twice is quicker than using shift.
