Use iOS device for audio output from computer via USB <body> I just got new Bluetooth headphones, but my Windows 10 PC does not have bluetooth. Is there a way I can play all audio from my PC to my iPhone 7 (preferably via the USB charger), and then use my Bluetooth headphones connected to the iPhone?  <answer266106> This is not possible. The closest thing I can think of, is opening Spotify on both devices. Control Spotify from your laptop and set the output device to your iPhone. Of course this only gives you Spotify Music.  <comment334067> Do you mean all audio? If so, I'd just spend $10 for a USB bluetooth dongle to plug into your PC. Then you can pair your headphones directly with it.
