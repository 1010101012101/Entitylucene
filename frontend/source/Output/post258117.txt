Flycut icon disappears when I open Word <body> My Flycut clipboard icon in the top ribbon disappears when I open Word - the program where I most need it! I think it's just lack of space. The large icon in the bottom dock doesn't hold my cuttings.  How can I access the missing icon? Can I change the position of other items in the top ribbon (date, volume, etc.) so the ones I need in Word are available? Or can I remove my name, which I don't need?

If you update to macOS Sierra 10.12, you can rearrange all menu bar items by ⌘-dragging them.  <comment322782> That worked and I can now use my Flycut clipboard again.  Much appreciated - thank you! <comment322803> @PHarrison Welcome to Ask Different!
