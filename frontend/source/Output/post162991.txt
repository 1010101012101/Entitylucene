How to visualize calendar dates (in Keynote? Or Numbers?) <body> I am having trouble visualizing dates in a presentation. This image is a good example of what I'm hoping to have, but I would like a way to make the slide from a table of dates (rather than making each box by hand, which is what happened here).   Any suggestions? I can use Numbers, Keynote, or Excel or PowerPoint for Mac. Also open to other software options that would do this.  <answer163146> You might want to try the Office "gantt chart" feature to present your data.     Options for making a Gantt chart      Although it is not a graphical tool by design, it is possible, with   quite a bit of formatting, to make a Gantt chart in Excel. You can do   this by turning your project tables into an Excel Gantt chart using   Excel's bar graph functionality. It is also possible and significantly   easier to create much more graphical and more manageable Gantt charts   in PowerPoint, such as the one above. You can do this by simply   pasting your Excel project tables into a PowerPoint add-in called   Office Timeline.   There are many templates available here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwxA2.jpg" alt="gant chart"  <comment190746> you are right, that one is way to busy, to many colors. <comment190748> I would use 1 color and place the α β γ in the boxes, it is clear that that is the order anyway. <comment190749> @Buscar웃 Thanks for the suggestion. Any ideas on how to make the chart automatically from spreadsheet data? <comment190754> I only know and use Excel :) <comment190950> @Buscar웃: Any idea what to use to do it in Excel? I have Excel too, but wouldn't know where to look or what to google for to find how to do something like this. Thanks! <comment191139> see my answer :)
