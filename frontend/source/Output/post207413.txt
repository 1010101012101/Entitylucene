iPad Air 2 iOS 9/9.0.1 multitasking split view won't work <body> My IPad Air 2 (model number: MGKM2LL/A,  Apple iPad Air 2 ‑ Wi‑Fi ‑ 64 GB ‑ 9.7" ‑ Silver) will not go into split view mode half of the screen, it will only go to the smaller bar 1/3 of the screen. I used the split view mode once but now the slide bar doesn't show up, I can't make the smaller bar get more than 1/3 of the screen, and I can't use two apps simultaneously. This problem occurred when my iPad was on iOS 9 and I updated it again to iOS 9.0.1 and the problem is still happening.  <answer207552> after activating the "Slide Over" 1/3 pane, drag the split edge to center of screen  <comment250488> I'm still not in the habit of making the split permanent by dragging it. Nice for a +1
