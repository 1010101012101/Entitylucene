AppleScript used to download subtitle files <body> I'm trying to download over 1000 subtitle files for a list of films. I have the list in Microsoft Excel. I found an application called FlixTools that lets you search for a film and then download the subtitles for that film. So far, I have written the following AppleScript:  precodeactivate application "Microsoft Excel" tell application "System Events" to tell process "Microsoft Excel"     keystroke "c" using command down     key code 125 end tell activate application "FlixTools" tell application "System Events" to tell process "FlixTools" to keystroke "v" using command down tell application "System Events" to tell process "FlixTools" to click button "Save Subtitle" /code/pre  Running this code returns an error saying: "Can't get button "Save Subtitle" of process "FlixTools"".  The FlixTools window looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGcVn.png" alt="enter image description here"  After clicking on the "Save Subtitle" button on the bottom right, a window appears to save the file:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gMgNe.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm new to AppleScript, so any help on how to format achieve this would be appreciated.  <answer286604> Use the following example to click the "Save Subtitle" button:  precodetell application "System Events" to click UI element "Save Subtitle" of group 1 of window 1 of application process "FlixTools" /code/pre
