Storage full on iPhone.. With a fresh install of iOS <body> I'm on a fresh install of iOS 9.3.5 (yesterday), on an iPhone 5.  How can this be possible? Storage full it says!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yp8l6.png" width="300"  <comment321911> How exactly did you do the install? Install as new or restore from backup? Also, what exactly is the question (as the "How is this possible" part can be answered with "Your apps and data use all available space" which doesn't really solve your problem)? <comment322011> It turned out my iCloud Photo library was downloaded on my phone, even if it only says 201 MB on the picture. And there was no way to delete them from the iPhone without deleting them from iCloud. So I saved all my photo on a drive, disabled iCloud Photo and finally delete my local library.
