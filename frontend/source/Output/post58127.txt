Where is "jvisualvm" in Mountain Lion <body> Just upgraded to Mountain Lion (of course). I use Java on a daily basis so I asked Mac OS X to install it right away. It installed "Java 6". I am more than OK with it.  The only thing I don't have is a utility that comes (used to come at least) with it that is called 'jvisualvm'. Any ideas on how to install it on Mountain Lion?  <answer58130> You should be able to download it from http://visualvm.java.net/index.html.  <comment66865> Just awesome... <comment66869> Just DuckDuckGo (or Google)...
