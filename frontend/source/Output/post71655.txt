iCal does not update Google calender <body> I am using iCal. I have a strange problem. If I make a task in my Google calender, iCal automatically shows that task on the calender. But, if I put a task in my iCal, Google calender does not update that task. I do not know why??  For your information I am using  Mac OSX Lion: 10.7.5 iCal: 5.0.3  Thanks, in advance.  <comment83230> Do you choose the correct calendar, when you create the event/task? <comment83283> Thanks, I did not select default calender as my Google calender, before in my iCal preference. Now It works.
