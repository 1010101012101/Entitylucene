install g77 using fink <body> I am trying to install convex optimization package OBOE: https://projects.coin-or.org/OBOE/wiki/MacosxOboe  I followed its instruction, but I run into errors in this step:  precodefink install g77 /code/pre  I think fink is properly install because:  precodefink install atlas /code/pre  is run successfully;  while  precodefink install g77 /code/pre  tells me:  precodeInformation about 10346 packages read in 1 seconds. Failed: no package found for specification 'g77'! /code/pre  does someone know what happened? Thank you  <answer157829> Check out question 5.8 in http://www.finkproject.org/faq/usage-fink.php?phpLang=en#unstable I got the hint from http://sourceforge.net/p/fink/mailman/message/25799171/     Q5.8: There's this package in unstable that I want to install, but the   fink command just says 'no package found'. How can I install it?      A: First make sure you understand what 'unstable' means. Packages in   the unstable tree are not in stable for any number of reasons. It   could be because there are known issues, validation errors, or just   not enough people giving feedback that the package works for them. For   that reason, Fink doesn't search the unstable tree by default.      If you do enable unstable, please remember to e-mail the maintainer if   something works (or even if it doesn't). Feedback from users like you   is what we use to determine if something is ready for stable! To find   out the maintainer of a package, run fink info packagename.      For fink-0.26 and later: If you run fink configure one of the   questions will ask whether you want to turn the unstable trees on.      To configure Fink to use unstable when you have an earlier version of   the fink tool than 0.26, edit /sw/etc/fink.conf, and add unstable/main   and unstable/crypto to the Trees: line.      If you use Fink Commander, then there is a Preference to use unstable   packages.      None of these options actually download the unstable tree's package   descriptions.You'll need to turn on rsync or cvs updating to do this,   which is not set up by default on a new Fink installation. The   following command sequence will set you up on a new Fink installation:   precodefink selfupdate /code/pre  followed by  precodefink selfupdate-rsync /code/pre  or  precodefink selfupdate-cvs /code/pre  and then  precodefink index -f fink scanpackages /code/pre     Note: There are Fink Commander analogs   for everything except fink index -f. You will have to use the command   line for that.      If you're already set up with rsync or cvs updating, then the   following command sequence (or the Fink Commander analogs) will   suffice:      fink selfupdate fink index fink scanpackages   If you're not sure what   your update method is, check fink --version in at a command line and   see if that mentions cvs or rsync.      If you don't want to install any more from unstable than your specific   package(s) and its (their) dependencies, (and any base packages that   got updated) don't use the update-all command until you turn the   unstable tree back off.   <comment185590> error message is that fink does not have a package called g77 - why do you think it should have? <comment289270> http://stackoverflow.com/q/27092293/781723.
