macOS System Integrity Protection Configuration <body> I was looking to lock down the configuration on some macs, and wanted to know if there is any way to change the files and folders that SIP protects.  I know it can be disabled, and its current rules viewed, but is there any way to add your own protected directories?  Thanks  <answer272031> sAs far as I know, there is no way to modify which directories SIP protects; SIP is either on or off. Apple appears to make no mention to such an ability in their developer documents either./s  Disregard this, @kanomath has a better answer. The latter part of my answer still stands to a limited degree.  If you want to lock down configuration files, modify the filesystem permissions either through the Finder GUI or the command line utility codechown/code.  <answer272079> It is possible to add your own protected directory to SIP:  ul liBoot to Recovery Mode and disable SIP/li liReboot and create a directory structure./li liFlag the whole folder or single files or folders:  precodesudo chflags restricted /example sudo chflags restricted /example/example.app sudo chflags restricted /example/subdir/file /code/pre  or a folder hierarchy:  precodesudo chflags -R restricted /example /code/pre  If you want to exclude a subdir after using the -R option you have to remove the restricted flag there:  precodesudo chflags norestricted /example/subdir /code/pre/li liBoot to Recovery Mode and enable SIP/li /ul  Now the folders emexample/em, emexample.app/em and the file em/example/subdir/file/em are protected. You still can add or remove files to/from em/example/subdir/em.  hr  The emrestricted/em flag has no effect if SIP is disabled - the usual POSIX/ACLs permissions apply. With SIP enabled the files/folders are protected.  hr  It is also possible to add, remove or change SIP-protected files and directories via an installer package which is signed by Appleâ€™s own certificate authority. Since a normal user /customer usually doesn't have access to this certificate authority, this possibility is eliminated.  hr  An earlier version of this answer asserted that it is required to modify the file /System/Library/Sandbox/rootless.conf and add something like:  precode                                /example                                 /example/example.app *                               /example/subdir                                 /example/subdir/file /code/pre  strongThis is wrong! Simply flagging a file or folder as emrestricted/em is sufficient to protect it./strong   <comment341978> Fair enough, edited to refer to your answer. <comment342260> Thank you so much!  This worked exactly as I had hoped.
