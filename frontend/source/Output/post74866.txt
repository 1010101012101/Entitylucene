windows can't read my HDD installed in my dvd slot on MBP <body> I've swapped my dvd drive with an HDD drive on my MBP 2008 non-unibody. I can read it from MAC os but not from Windows. I did configure it to be PC compatible...  Anyone knows why it's not seen as an addtional hard drive?  <answer74875> "PC compatible" refers to the way, partitions are written to the disc, I think. If it is HFS formated, Windows does not recognize it. Have you tried to format it with FAT32?  <comment105603> The Boot Camp 3.x driver pack includes a read-only HFS+ driver.
