Time Machine won't delete older backups <body> I just updated my Mac to the latest macOS Sierra and now I can't backup through Time Machine since the following error is prompted:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WRQWb.png" alt="enter image description here"  I thought that Time Machine were able to automatically delete the oldest backups to save space for new ones, but it seems that I have to do it by myself.  Does anyone know how to fix this issue?
