I had a time machine backup that went AWOL when I connected the HD <body> I thought the HD was damaged (I've had it for about 4 years and connect it regularly 1 time a week to sync), so I formatted it and looked to see if that was the case but it seems fine. I proceeded to use it again and then I encrypted it, after that it entirely disappeared again.  I, again, formatted it and as soon as I encrypt it, it goes AWOL and I can't find it with Finder, Disk Utility, Time Machine, Terminal or anything really. In fact, if I bring up Disk Utility when it's plugged in (after encrypting) the app gets stuck until I unplug it. I should add that if I merely use Time Machine (no encryption) then it seems to be working just fine.  Any ideas what's going on?  I am running macOS Sierra 10.12.1 and the HD is this one: www.amzn.com/B0041OSQ9S.  <comment332506> Where are you encrypting it? Disk Utility or Time Machine itself?
