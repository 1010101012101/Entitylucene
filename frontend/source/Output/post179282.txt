Tab completion in terminal with alias <body> I'm running a emzsh/em terminal under Yosemite and have defined a simple alias to place files in Yoink:  precode$ alias yoink='open -a Yoink' $ yoink my-file-to-yoink.txt /code/pre  This works great but for some unknown reason the tab completion to specify the file does not work after codeyoink/code. It simple says code-- no matches found --/code.  Is there a way I can use tab completing in combination with this alias?  Thanks.  ps: Not sure if it's related, but I'm using zprezto.  <answer179291> Did you tried zsh-completions?  precode$ brew info zsh-completions zsh-completions: stable 0.12.0, HEAD https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions Not installed From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/zsh-completions.rb ==&gt; Caveats To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:    fpath=(/usr/local/share/zsh-completions $fpath)  You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:    rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit  Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting to load these completions, you may need to run this:    chmod go-w /usr/local/share /code/pre  <comment212489> Installed it, but still no tab completion for files after the `yoink`. <comment212498> I can only tell my bash experience, I do not use the zsh. Single quotes are for fixed strings, imagine it to be like a rock. Double quotes are for variable strings. Try defining your alias with double quotes, that always worked for me IN BASH... <comment212505> @Garex: Thanks for the tip. Tried it, but it didn't work.
