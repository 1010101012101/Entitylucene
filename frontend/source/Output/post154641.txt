Clean install of Yosemite on 2008 MacBook Air <body> I am trying to upgrade a 2008 MacBook Air from OS X 10.5.8 (Leopard) to 10.10 (Yosemite). I understand from the Apple web site that the minimum required version of OS X is 10.6.x (Snow Leopard) for an in-place upgrade. However, I am assuming —correct me if I'm wrong— that the pre-existing version requirement isn't relevant if doing a clean install from a USB boot disk or other media? In any case I have had trouble doing this, hence this post:  I have found several guides on how to create a bootable USB stick for Yosemite, and my colleague has kindly created one for me using her newer MacBook. The guide used is located at http://www.guidingtech.com/34311/clean-install-yosemite-os-x/. I have attempted the install using the stick, by pressing the alt key after power on and selecting the USB stick but I am then faced with a No entry sign and the Air shuts itself down.  I would like to know what the most appropriate approach would be to get Yosemite working (legally). I don't have a Snow Leopard disc, and ideally I'd like to do a clean install anyway.  <answer155085> What you're encountering is not related to the pre-existing version, but likely that your MacBook Air is not supported for Yosemite at all.  Apple lists the Late 2008 model as the earliest MacBook Air which can run Yosemite.

I also read somewhere that building a bootable USB stick may not necessarily mean universal compatibility i.e. hardware-specific drivers might be added during the build process. In any case my plan now is to buy Snow Leopard (it's cheap) and upgrade as far as I can. Thanks. <comment183117> click on apple icon then about this mac.   Will tell you the model.
