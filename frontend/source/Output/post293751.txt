Is there a listing or documentation on the commands?  <comment370782> Open /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/bin in various folders after installing a fresh macOS. Then you **see** all stock command line tools. To get a listing of almost all command line tools and a short summary enter `apropos .  apropos.txt` and open the resulting file in TextEdit. To  get the manual for a command enter `man command` (e.g. `man man` or `man apropos`). <comment370784> @klanomath, you should make that into an answer, and if you want, include the link to [Mac OS X Manual Pages](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/) too.
