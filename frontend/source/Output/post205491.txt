Can Spotlight search for text within Safari for iPhone? <body> Is there a way to search text within Safari by doing a Spotlight search on an iPhone? There currently is no such way to run a find/search within Safari (boo), so I need a work around.  <answer208489> No, Spotlight doesn't search the current page from within Mobile Safari (but it does search Reading List and other saved/bookmarked pages) but you don't need a workaround since this function exists in Safari.  It used to look like this.   On iOS 9, it's integrated with the main search field - begin like you're searching for a new web page and then scroll down to "On this page"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mJIe9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Once you tap that, you get this interface to pan to each instance of the search results with the term highlighted.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Fb7i.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
