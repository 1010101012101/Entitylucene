purchased a paid app on a laptop and will not appear on my mac's itunes <body> I purchased a paid app on my laptop, after logging in with my apple ID, and even got an email verifying my purchase. Today, I logged in to my mac, opened itunes and the app was not in the list with my apps. What happened?  <comment118947> Can you help me narrow this down a bit? There is an iOS app store and a Mac app store and they work slightly differently. I'm guessing you purchased an iOS app from iTunes on a Mac?
