IBooks are not synchronized between my Apple devices <body> I don't seem to be able to synchronize my iPad (2) and IPhone (5s) to access the iBooks documents saved across the devices. They are both updated to the latest iOS.  I Have looked into all the settings and they all appear to be OK, but still don't know if I am missing to set the the ones that engages the iBooks. I noted that in the iCloud "settings" I don't see the iBooks icon as I do with the Photos, Mail, Notes, contacts, Calendar, etc., which I manage to see across devices.   However, I don't find a way for iBooks to add it or for making it into my iCloud Settings screen menu.  <answer167637> ul liOpen Settings app on both devices and verify both have an iCloud backup (or connect to iTunes and back up both)/li liSign out of iTunes &amp; App Store and then reboot both devices/li liSign back in to the iTunes &amp; App store on one device/li liOpen iBooks and see what it shows for your purchases / books./li liTap to download one of each (a purchased book and a synced book)/li liThen review the iBooks settings in the settings app for this device/li /ul  Repeat the sign in steps for the second iOS device. Pay attention to the "Sync Collections" setting for iBooks.  <answer172056> So I had the same problem but I figured it out. I backup my iPhone like he said.  ul liThen I clicked on my iPhone icon on my iTune./li liClick the first book icon and select Sync Books. you have the option of syncing all your books or selected books. Select the codeSync/code button below and apply./li liOnce this is done click on the second books icon to see your books. Note if your books are not completely sync they won't appear on this section./li liThen go to your iPhone, open your iBook and click the books icon./li liIf it still didn't work, delete your iBook app and download it again./li liClick on codeOK/code to allow books to sync./li /ul  <comment196561> what do you want to do? do you need sync (download) the punched book from your Mac to iPad and iPhone ? <comment196565> Rather than saying you looked into all the settings perhaps list the exact sequence to get to the settings you are checking or provide a screen shot of one of the devices with the applicable settings. <comment196825> Nelson: I don't have a Mac.  I am trying to find the way to sync my iPhone and iPad iBooks to see my Docs in there, particularly PDF files. Tks. <comment196826> Bmike: I will review the settings of interest to make the screen shots to see how I can get the help to resolve the sync issue with iBooks to access my PDFs betweend the two devices.  Tks. <comment196828> Sign out & Rebooting and sign in the two devices did not work. <comment196884> While looking at the settings menu to take screen shots, I noted that iBooks is not listed in the Apps included in my iCloud settings menu. If that is the issue, how I can add iBooks to the iCloud App menu? I tried adding the screen shot in this comment using my iPad to no avail.  Tks for the help.
