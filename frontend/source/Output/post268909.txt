iCloud Photo Library on external drive <body> I need help.  I created a new Photos library on an external drive and enabled iCloud Photo Library (I have to mention that I have no library on the internal drive).    When photos started downloading from iCloud, I saw that my internal storage, and not my external drive, is growing in space.    The question is, does iCloud Photo Library only work on the internal drive and not on an external one?  I made sure, too, that the library is used as a system library.  <comment362868> Can you verify that the library on the external drive is set as the System Library?
