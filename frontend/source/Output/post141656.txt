Default to Enabled Show Styles Guide in Word 2011 <body> I would like to have the styles guide and direct formatting guide to be on by default. There is no option in the preferences. The options are at the bottom of the styles guide panel, as seen in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TSU24.png" alt="Styles Guide Panel"  I've opened the code~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Word.plist/code through Xcode but couldn't find anything that looked to match what this preference might be. It appears that there are more preferences than what are included in that file, but I haven't been able to find a list anywhere.
