8 (or more) monitors on mac pro 5.1 <body> I have a mac pro 3,1 eight core; I am running eight monitors on it using four ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT cards, 256mb each.  I just bought (but have not received yet) a Mac Pro 5,1 twelve core. It has a 2-port card that came stock with it back in the day. I would like to take that card out, put in whatever it takes to get eight (or more) video ports, then set it up the same way, with eight (or more) monitors. I'm upgrading primarily for more CPU/core performance.  I am not even slightly interested in 3d/GPU performance. I compile and edit, with a bit of web browsing. I spend a lot of time in various shells doing scripting. I don't game and I don't use any kind of 3d CAD. I don't have any particular interest in leveraging GPUs with OpenCL. The ATI cards I have are satisfactory.  As of today, I have found ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT's on EBay for about $50. These are low-power consumption cards that work great in the 3,1 model. Four of them is no stress at all on the 300w capability of the mac pro PSU. Does anyone know if they will work in the 5,1 model? If they do, that would be outstanding.  Failing that, I have seen four port HDMI cards, each of which consume a single slot. Physically speaking, four of them would fit. Does anyone know if any version of such a card will work in a 5.1 with (at least) two cards installed? (Three would be emawesome/em)  HD, or better, capability for each monitor (1920x1080)/+ is desirable.  <comment337780> Is there a reason not to move your old cards to the new tower? <comment337782> Well, I still have it - it's not dead, it's just getting abandoned by Apple, they won't let it run Sierra, for instance. I have a lot of software to move over, and I'd just as soon have both systems running, at least for a while, until I'm sure the new one doesn't have any... quirks <comment337794> Honestly I don't know what you're looking for. The setup you have now seems to work fine. If you want both computers to be able to run 8 monitors each, I'd buy the same kind of cards you have now. I can't think of anything cheaper than $200 for 8 monitors @1080p) <comment337809> Woah so many monitors. Let me know what you're looking for that's not your same cards in addition to NoahL with `@owlswipe`. <comment337814> Well, the question really is, will those old cards I'm using in the 3,1 machine also work in a 5,1 machine. If they will, I'm good, and I'll just get four of them. But I can't find any compatibility info, hence my question. And Apple _has_ been intentionally obsoleting perfectly good hardware, so it's not a given that just because they were good in a 3,1 machine, they'll be good in a 5,1 machine. <comment337815> Owlswipe, the card it comes with would work, but the I/O is terrible -- one dual DVI port and one Displayport. I'd just as soon have two DVI or two HDMI per card if I can manage it. <comment337817> Theoretically it should work. Apple can't really make third-party hardware obsolete. It's worth buying from a place that you can return them to easily just in case. If you have the cash and want something more powerful (for future upgrades into 4K screens or if you want to use your other PCIe slots), this card is swag: https://m.newegg.com/Product/Details?itemnumber=N82E16814132055) <comment337820> Noah, I can't find anything that indicates anyone's got an NVS810 running on a mac pro. Do you know of any such thing? The card looks fabulous, but they don't talk about OS X on the specs page <comment337823> Oops! I thought it was a quadro-based card. Nvidia Quadro and GTX cards (except the 10xx series) work with drivers. If I were you, I'd just go with the same cards you have. 1) they work 2) they're cheap 3) you can always upgrade later. <comment337826> I will certainly do that _if_ they work. Thanks for the info. That really is a fabulous card.
