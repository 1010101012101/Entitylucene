How To Enable The "Hidden" Debug Menu? <body> Following on from my previous question entitled "What is the function(s) of the hidden Debug menu in Disk Utility?".   How do I enable the Debug Menu via Terminal command or otherwise, thereby increasing the functionality of Disk Utility ?  <answer96116> ol liQuit Disk Utility if it's open./li liOpen the Terminal application in code/Applications/Utilities/code./li liType this exact command and hit Enter key:  codedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility DUDebugMenuEnabled 1/code/li liQuit the Terminal application./li liLaunch Disk Utility and you will have a the Debug menu./li /ol  <comment112832> I don't understand, the answer provided in the previous question says how to turn on the Debug menu. Additionally, you can also use `DiskUtil` from terminal to get full functionality. <comment112835> @hoss I thought that if someone was googling how to enable the debug menu this would show in the results (might be wrong though). Whereas the title of the other question was its function. <comment112836> @hoss I will agree that a link to enablement was provided in the answer to my previous question (without my asking for it - although goes hand in hand I suppose). <comment112867> This is good - it will be linked with the other two questions so anyone searching exactly for this will find the threads we have on debug and Disk Utility <comment112872> @bmike Ok Fine. <comment285336> Seems not to work in El Captain 10.11.4
