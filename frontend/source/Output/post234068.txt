Is there an alternative to hiding an application that will reduce the performance demand? <body> I'm just wondering if there is an alternative to hiding an application, that can reduce the performance demand of a program. I'm curious because I use blender from steam, but steam won't close unless all its own programs are closed. Soo, when I run blender, I run steam and I can't close it. Upon looking up the activity monitor stats I found that steam actually uses quite a lot of performance and energy so I would like to know if there is a way around that, but not just steam, it would be pretty useful for other programs too.  <comment286089> Doesn't really answer your question, but you can get Blender independently of Steam - https://www.blender.org/download/ <comment286103> Yes thats what I used to do but I quite liked the idea of steam automatically updating blender for me, it used to be quite a hassle doing that... <comment286106> I meant overall, I was 'indirectly' referring to the CPU, Memory and Power tabs <comment286214> While you're in an application press cmd + h or right click the icon on the dock and click hide.
