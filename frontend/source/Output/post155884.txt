Yosemite: iCloud Drive offline <body> I'm wondering if it is possible to use iCloud Drive as a 'mounted drive'. As of now, I have a photo's collection of around 50GB. I'm keeping the files on an external HDD as it hogs my Macbooks' SSD. I'm loving the new iCloud Photo's Library (even though there isn't a Photo's app for OS X yet). I noticed that iCloud Drive is actually using up space on my SSD. Transferring the photo's to iCloud when the photo's app comes out doesn't seem like a solution as it would still hogg my SSD. Is it possible to mount iCloud Drive as a network drive?
