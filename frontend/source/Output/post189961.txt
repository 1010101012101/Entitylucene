How to view multiple inboxes on Apple Watch (individually) <body> It seems like in the iPhone's Watch app for email I can select one and only one mailbox to read from the Watch (Include Mail setting). I really dislike the "All Inboxes" concept, but would like to have two of my four inboxes available, along with a sub-folder or two. Is that possible with the stock Mail app? Thanks!  <answer192594> From the Apple Watch user box (https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1708/en_US/apple_watch_user_guide.pdf): "Choose which mailbox appears on Apple Watch. Open the Apple Watch app on iPhone, tap My Watch, then go to Mail  Include Mail. You can specify only one mailbox, although if you don’t choose a mailbox, you’ll see content from all inboxes."
