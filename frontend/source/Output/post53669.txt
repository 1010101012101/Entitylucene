Can not burn 1.4GB data into a 4.7GB DVD (file too big) <body> I'm trying to burn 1.4GB of data into a 4.7GB DVD using Finder in Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. The biggest file is 300MB.   Here are the steps I take:  ul liInsert blank disc/li liOpen Finder and drag files to disc/li liGo to File - Burn/li /ul  However, I get this error message      Disc_name is too large to fit on the disc. Remove some files and try again.   How can this be solved?  <answer53675> It turned out to be a very simple problem in my case. I just have a bad disc.
