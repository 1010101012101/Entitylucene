iTunes not recognizing Apple TV 4th gen <body> I'm having an issue with Apple TV 4th gen not showing up in iTunes.  Yesterday, the light on the Apple TV started blinking. Doing a quick search for a remedy led to an answer of a reset through iTunes, however, Apple TV is not showing up on my itunes. Any ideas out there on how to get iTunes to recognize the Apple TV? I've just downloaded the latest iTunes update and still not working. The Apple TV isn't responding, just blinking. Any help is appreciated.
