Parallels creates /Users/Shared/Parallels on boot, blocks ZFS /Users from mounting <body> Does anyone know why Parallels creates /Users/Shared/parallels on boot? Or what creates it?  I have a ZFS volumes for /Users. However, since installing Parallels 7 I've found that the ZFS volume can't mount because earlier in the boot process Parallels have already put an empty Shared/Parallels/backups directory into /Users.  Any way to disable this, or delay it til after ZFS mounts would be great.  At the moment I have to log into a console, use a spare admin user to remove /Users, then zfs mount my /Users. All very irritating.  There are several system LaunchAgents for Parallels, but not very descriptive.  ul liOS: 10.8.2/li liParallels: updated Parallels 7./li liZFS: ZFS Community Edition/li /ul  Updates for Graham:  precodealex@smiley:~|⇒  ls -lrt /Library/LaunchAgents/*ara*  -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  797 Sep  3 16:12 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.parallels.vm.prl_pcproxy.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  565 Sep  3 16:13 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.parallels.desktop.launch.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  721 Sep  3 16:13 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.parallels.DesktopControlAgent.plist alex@smiley:~|⇒  sudo launchctl list | grep arallel   228 -   com.parallels.vm.prl_naptd 78  -   com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon alex@smiley:~|⇒  kextstat | grep arallel   111    0 0xffffff7f8241f000 0x7000     0x7000     com.parallels.kext.prl_usb_connect (7.0 15107.796624) &lt;39 7 5 4 3 1&gt;   112    1 0xffffff7f82426000 0x5c000    0x5c000    com.parallels.kext.prl_hypervisor (7.0 15107.796624) &lt;10 9 7 5 4 3 1&gt;   113    0 0xffffff7f82482000 0x4000     0x4000     com.parallels.kext.prl_hid_hook (7.0 15107.796624) &lt;7 5 4 3 1&gt;   114    0 0xffffff7f82486000 0xc000     0xc000     com.parallels.kext.prl_netbridge (7.0 15107.796624) &lt;112 5 4 3 1&gt;   115    0 0xffffff7f82492000 0x4000     0x4000     com.parallels.kext.prl_vnic (7.0 15107.796624) &lt;35 5 4 3 1&gt; /code/pre  Looks like DesktopControlAgent isn't loaded.  hr  Following Graham's pointer to wait4path I updated  com.parallels.desktop.launchdaemon.plist in /Library/LaunchDaemons to:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/bin/bash&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;wait4path /Users/Shared/Parallels &amp;amp;&amp;amp; /Library/Parallels/Parallels\ Service.app/Contents/Resources/ParallelsDispatcherService start&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  That seems to have fixed it. At least, Parallels still runs, and the computer loads properly at start-up.

An early guess: a workaround might involve codewait4path/code   wait4path(1) OS X Manual Page  <comment82324> Please add to your question the outputs from `sudo launchctl list | grep arallel` and `kextstat | grep arallel` (assuming *arallel* will find all Parallels-related files) – thanks.
