MS Word rendering problem with Apple products? <body> I created the Word 2010 file and then converted it to PDF in Windows. I recently tried to open this PDF file on my iPhone, the problem is only the cover page which iPhone renders quite horribly (there is no image/picture on the cover page, only the texts and rectangle shapes as the background), but the rest of the document seems to be fine except the one I just mentioned. Do you know how to get this thing sorted?
