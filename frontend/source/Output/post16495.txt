Customer Ratings on Apple Appstore? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Ratings and Reviews not showing up for newly released app. Is there a standard delay or is something wrong?       I don't know whats wrong with Apple Customer Ratings system on Appstore.  Recently I have uploaded two apps on appstore. And still there are no ratings/reviews on apps. Infact I observed there are 1000s of downloads has been made in last 2 days.  To verify this 1 of my friend also added his comment with rating yesterday on 1 of my App. But his comment also not visible, still there are zero customer reviews in both Apps.  Can anyone update me regarding this issue ?  <comment18025> This looks to be a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/6405/5472 - it's likely that a number of reviews are needed to kick an app into the status where reviews become published. Have you tried asking developers on the apple developer forums - they might be more likely to answer there. <comment18036> bmike is right; this is a duplicate. Also, in the future, please keep the rant out of your question. The words "I don't know what's wrong with..." are unnecessary. Thanks for your cooperation.
