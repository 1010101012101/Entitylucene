Wrong device name displayed in iTunes <body> Whenever I sync on any computer my 3G iPhone, it will recognize and sync but doesn't show my original name for the phone. How do I replace it?  <answer39767> In the iTunes source list, select the device, then click on its name again and hold the mouse button down until the device name becomes editable.  <comment44935> I assume you're using iTunes to sync? <comment44949> Right-click  Rename works too.
