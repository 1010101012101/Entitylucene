Is it possible to disable cellular data use? <body> If I buy the 250MB monthly data plan and share with my wife, but use WiFi for 98% of the monthly usage, will this work for us? We are retired and home all day.  I keep hearing that the iPhone will use cellular data regardless of WiFi, can I keep this from happening?  <answer125747> The iPhone will prefer Wi-Fi over Cellular data, so if you are connected to Wi-Fi your iPhone will use that connection instead of Cellular.  To completely disable Cellular data, go to Settings â†’ Cellular and disable Cellular Data. This will prevent your device from using Cellular data at all.
