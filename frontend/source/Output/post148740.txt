Update apps with home-brew (youtube-dl) <body> Mainly i want to update youtube-dl on my mac. I have used Linux so for that updating any app is very simple: apt-get update youtube-dl. But how to do it on Mac using home-brew. Is there any kind of general command or something which will work for all the apps?  <answer148741> Run codebrew update/code first, then you can use codebrew upgrade/code to update all packages, or codebrew upgrade youtube-dl/code to update only codeyoutube-dl/code.  <answer148744> Not for brew, but from the documentation, you can run codeyoutube-dl -U/code to update.  <comment242571> Same situation, same question as OP. I installed with "brew" but trying to run the upgrade just now threw this error: `Error: youtube-dl 2015.07.28 already installed`. The `-U` option mentioned in the other answer worked with `sudo`, though. <comment242577> The (crossplatfom) instructions to update youtube-dl can be found as the first Q&A in the [Youtube-dl FAQ](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#faq). <comment242586> @Dav√Ød: I forgot to mention you need to run `brew update` first. If that doesn't work, maybe no one updated the youtube-dl formula and you should use `-U` if you need to update.
