Cannot manually delete favorites in Safari in iOS 10.3.2 <body> I've got an iPad 4 that I use irregularly, so I was a bit slow to update it to iOS 10.3.2. Since doing so, I've found that Safari takes a few tries to start up normally, and, when I try to delete a site from Favorites after accidentally adding it twice, it freezes up for a moment, and may or may not close, but does not delete the bookmark.   Two attempts so far have successfully deleted ema/em bookmark, but in both cases it was the most recent, and not the one targeted. Hard resetting doesn't seem to help.  Frankly, I'm a n00b when it comes to Apple devices, so any advice would be appreciated.  <answer291388> It's going to be very difficult to troubleshoot this based on the info you've provided.    Honestly, the iPad 4 is considered 'old' (introduced in 2012).  It does support the iOS version you're using but, like a 102 year-old man, it will struggle with some seemingly basic tasks like putting his pants on and using a spoon, simply because it's old.    If a reset didn't help, your only option might be to buy a new(er) device.
