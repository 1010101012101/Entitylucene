Mac is freezing. How to find the problem? <body> I have Macbook Pro Retina (Late 2013) with installed El capitan.  Sometimes OSX just freezing and I can do nothing, but to reboot (by holding power button for a few seconds). All apps are continue running, for example media player or torrent client. But keyboard or trackpad doesn't respond.  I read lots of manuals, I tried reset different settings, clear user's cache. I even tried reinstall OSX (without formatting the drive). It's not helping.  I don't have much experience with OSX, so I don't know where to look for a problem. Any thoughts what should I do?  <answer217955> Try using Apple Diagnostics to check for hardware issues: Restart your computer, then hold down the D key while the Mac restarts.  Check Apple knowledge base on this subject - https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21879  If you get an error-code, check this page for how to follow it up: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203747  <comment263444> I don't have any special software installed. Just regular stuff, like Chrome and Skype. Plus some apps for webdev - Jetbrains software, plus homebrew with php/ruby, etc. I checked the list of software, and don't see anything unusual. I also can't find the pattern here, because this problem can happens any time, when different apps are launched <comment263445> Did you check this? https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21879 <comment263654> yes, I did it, it doesn't shows anything <comment263656> hm, I run it second time and I got this error: `PPT004 The battery requires service. The battery is not functioning normally, though you may not notice a change in its behavior or the amount of charge it holds. You can continue to use your battery before its checked without harming your computer.` <comment263658> It seems that your macbook is somewhat unstable. Check this link for suggestions on what to do for this error-code:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203747 <comment263744> Diagnostic tool offered to bring my Mac to Apple Care, but I'm away now, will do it next week. It said I have coverage for it. But can this battery issue, cause freezes? <comment263811> I do not know much about power-handling in on portable components, but I would guess that if a component get irregular voltage input, it may cause the system to freeze. Some components may be more tolerant than others. <comment263910> yeah, but all apps are still working, for example when I watch movie and osx freezes, I can continue to watch the movie, but I can't interact with laptop anyhow. That's why it looks weird to me. Anyway, I will visit Apple Store as soon as I'll get a chance. Thanks
