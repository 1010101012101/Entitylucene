How to troubleshoot slow-as-molasses Safari 6? <body> When I upgraded to Lion, Safari 6 came along, and I find it so slow that it's almost unusable.  The problem is most pronounced when first fetching pages, especially in the first few minutes after it (Safari) was started.  I also find myself staring at the spinning beach ball (for minutes at a time) far more than with, say, Firefox.  How can I troubleshoot this problem?  <comment94247> Do you have any extensions installed in Safari? Does it happen if you just start up Safari or only if you start to access web pages? Did you clear the cache already? Does it also happen on other user accounts on the same computer (create one if necessary)? <comment94254> Do you have enough free RAM? This is usually a sign of not enough RAM available, especially when it happens also with Firefox. In Safari's case I would recommend cleaing the cache and saved icons, etc. <comment94298> Have you run Software Update and upgraded to the latest patches?
