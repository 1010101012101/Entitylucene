Error in opening Microsoft Word through Terminal <body> I haven't been able to open Microsoft Word through Terminal. I tried:  precodeopen -a Microsoft\Word /code/pre  But I get this in return:   precodeUnable to find application named 'MicrosoftWord' /code/pre  How can I open Microsoft Word (I see it in Applications so I know it's installed)?  <answer224279> You are missing a space, it should be:  precodeopen -a Microsoft\ Word /code/pre  Or:  precodeopen -a "Microsoft Word" /code/pre  Program names that contain spaces need to be escaped with a code\/code backslash or use code"/code quotes around the name, but not both.  <comment271994> Why have you put a backslash in what you typed? <comment272012> @Mark, He placed the backslash to escape the space in Microsoft Word but obviously forgot to type the space and for some reason couldn't figure it out from the error message. (That's my take on it anyway.)
