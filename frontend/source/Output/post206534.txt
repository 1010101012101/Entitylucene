IiPhone 5s won't appear in iTunes (appears in my computer) after iTunes update <body> I'm running Windows 10, and I recently updated my iTunes to the most recent version. Ever since then, my iPhone doesn't appear in iTunes. However, it still appears in my computer under "Apple iPhone" (rather than the actual name that I named it). Also, everytime I plug it in, it continually asks me to allow the computer to access my photos and videos.  Any ideas to how I can get iTunes to recognise it?
