MBP shut down and will not power back on <body> My MacBook unexpectedly shutdown and not responding to power button or even battery status button, the lights on battery status isn't showing too. What happened? What should I do? Edit : the charger light is dim and it's blinking amber and green light.   <answer132038> We get this all the time, just wiggle it and it will turn red ;)  <answer132173> After searching the net and not coming up with any solution, i went to Apple Care Center and they had it diagnosed, turned out, it was full of dust. They recommended me having it serviced every 6 months. Phew, now its working fine.  <comment155180> By memory status button do you mean the button on the left edge of the Mac with 8 LEDs next to it? <comment155181> @Mr Rabbit yes, not sure what is it called <comment155182> Ah, ok, those are the battery indicator lights.

The process varies based on the Mac, this article should help you - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964 <comment155192> @Mr Rabbit I tried the link procedure and it didn't work. My MBP won't start
