Developer Program for Viewing Passbook-Related Pages <body> I have a registered Apple Developer account. However, I cannot view the following pages:  ul liiOS Provisioning Portal/li lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Reference/PassKit_Bundle/Chapters/Introduction.html/li lihttps://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=Passbook/li /ul  Do I need to join the iOS Developer Program ($99/year) just to view those documentations?  <answer66636> Yes - those links are pre-release and protected to iOS registered developers. You might get by with an educational account - but most developers use the $99/year plan to gain access to the Provisioning Portal.  Provisioning devices for testing your application on real iPhones rather than the simulator does require a membership, as does any pre-release software or documentation. However, Passbook is not pre-release documentation any more; with the release of iOS 6, they have published public documentation, so you can view this. If you need more information as to what the $99/year membership gives you access to, view their iOS Developer Program page.  <comment78481> The last link i.e. Passbook Support Materials seems to be an independent issue: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4380960?start=0&tstart=0 <comment136074> What sort of registered account do you have?
