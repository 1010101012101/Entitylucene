What is the yellow warning sign in the "Login Items" Tab under the "Users & Group" System Preferences? <body> I was deleting Skype from my login items and noticed that iTunesHelper showed a warning under a unmarked column. What does it mean and how do I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7WBu6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer47041> The yellow warning sign means that the login item can no longer be found, most likely because the application was deleted or moved after it was added to the login items. If you hover your cursor over the triangle, it will tell you:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ajcIm.png" alt="enter image description here"  To re-add iTunesHelper:  ol liFind iTunes in /Applications/li liRight-click on it, and select "Show Package Contents"./li liNavigate into Contents, and then MacOS/li liDrag iTunesHelper into your Login Items in System Preferences/li liCheck "Hide" to hide it on launch (this may not be necessary, but it's how iTunes sets it up)/li /ol  <comment53877> Thanks, any suggestion on how to fix it, for example with iTunesHelper? <comment53878> @SteveMoser Yep, just edited my answer with instructions <comment53879> Thanks, I'll accept after the 5 min waiting period. I wish the waiting period wasn't necessary but it makes sense. <comment357367> It seems that hovering over it in macOS Sierra no longer says what the reason is for the warning triangle.  I guess we should just assume it always means the file is missing?
