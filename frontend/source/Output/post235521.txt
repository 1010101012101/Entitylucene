Is there a way to log all incoming Push Notifications in OS X El Capitan (v 10.11.4)? <body> I need the ability to write all incoming Push Notifications (APNS) to a log file. Basically, I would like to end up with an ongoing record of all the Push Notifications that I receive. What is the best way for a newbie to do this in El Capitan?  <answer235522> You can install Growl. It can be configured to logs all the events including Push Notifications.  <comment288080> Thanks for the quick response. I will check-out Growl now.
