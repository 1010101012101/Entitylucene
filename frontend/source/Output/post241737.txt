I can't restore my iPhone from the latest back up <body> I'm unable to restore my iPhone.  I'm getting an error about an incorrect password.  First it backed up some stuff and not other stuff.  I went to the Apple store and they told me to delete this iPhone and try to back it up again because it never finished restoring.  Now it tells me I need a password and every password I've entered has been wrong.  <answer242091> You can issue "Forgot Apple ID or password?" on https://www.icloud.com/ open this link on your computer. Hope you get your password back!  <comment297048> The two that it might be are your passcode you use to unlock the phone or your Apple ID password. Perhaps bring it back to the Apple Store?
