Any help kindly appreciated!  <answer248867> I think you may need to rebuild the Launch Services Database.br The simplest, non-techy way would be to use Onyx (freeware)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xXig6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment308690> Thanks but it didn't work. I also re-set the new app as default and rebooted the system. Please let me know if you have another idea. Also, I'm OK with the _techy_ version too ;-)
