What kind of Barcode Reader USB can work on El Capitan / iMac <body> I don't know anything about Apple world... Our customer did have a Macbook (I think) and now he did switch to an iMac (I think with El Capitan?).  A simple barcode reader USB did work on old Mac. It did "beep" and it did write the scanned number properly on the screen.  With new iMac now the barcode reader does "beep" but it doesn't write anymore on the screen (on an Excel / Notepad / Browser etc etc etc).  Reading on the internet seems a well known bug of El Capitan.  Someone has tested some USB barcode reader and it works on El Capitan? For now not a big problem the cost... Or do you have a workaround?  Thank you  <answer248296> strongA USB barcode reader should just work out of the box./strong  I am personally using a Symbol (aka Motorola, aka Zebra) barcode reader.  Upon plugging it into my iMac running OS X El Capitan (10.11.6), it just shows up; no drivers were needed for the install. br br  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y7q2tl.png" alt="System Profiler"  This is the exact model barcode reader I am using for this example.

Doing a scan of a simple UPC barcode sends the characters to whatever application I am using (in this case, Notes)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ABGOm.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uh2q8m.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment307595> Most USB barcode readers just work like a keyboard and signal through the code as text. <comment307601> Is it the Motorola, all right? <comment307602> Yes.  Motorola owns the Symbol brand so it's one in the same
