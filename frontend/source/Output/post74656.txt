What information does iPhone 4S Log-Aggregated 2012-12-12 contain? <body> On the iPhone under the Settings  General  About  Diagnostics &amp; Usage Data  log aggregated, what does this mean?    precode&lt;key&gt;appActivationCount.com.apple.MobileSMS&lt;/key&gt; &lt;integer&gt;9&lt;/integer&gt; /code/pre  Does it mean the number of text sent or received or both?  <answer74658> It means that that program (the SMS application) was started 9 times on that day.  Whether that corresponds to someone checking the app in response to a message or simply entering the app isn't logged in that file. I don't know offhand if you can reconstruct that level of detail from any of the standard logs on iOS so you may need a forensic analysis of either the database the SMS app uses or the network / server side of things to track down delivery times or even something as detailed as a daily count of SMS messages.  <comment90002> Is there anything else I can add to my answer to help you?
