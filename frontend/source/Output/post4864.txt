ASM for Mac OS X <body> I've been very interested in learning ASM for a long time now and finally decided to get to it. The problem is I have a MacBook and most of the books teach you based on DOS/Linux or MIPS.  Do you have any good tips for starters in ASM on a Mac OS X?  <answer4887> Stackover flow has a good answer on this exact question:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5649/x86-assembly-on-a-mac  Basically, XCode includes almost all of what you need for x86 Assembly  <comment4857> I think this is better suited to stackoverflow.com.
