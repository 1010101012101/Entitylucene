Continue time machine backup with another Mac <body> I recently bought a new MacBook. It's running Yosemite and I managed to transfer my old user profile from the old computer via migration assistant.  Now I want to seamlessly continue my backup on the external USB HDD. But TM does not recognize that there's already a backup on the drive.  I was running osx 10.9 on the old computer. On the old computer, I was using a system partition and a data partition, on the new one I have only one partition. What can I do to continue my old backup?  <comment184424> When using Migration Assistant, you should have been prompted to specify whether you wanted the new Mac to inherit the old backup. <comment184443> Check out http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html for using `tmutil` to re-associate your new computer to your old Time Machine backup. The change in your partitioning will likely mean it will require a new backup of what used to reside on your old data partition if that was moved to your current single partition. <comment190274> @flyingtrashcan: might be, but I can't remember whether it really asked <comment190275> @duoggro: yes, that seems to have helped, although I had to restart the system more than once until it recognized the old backup. Until then, I was always prompted to create a completely new backup.
