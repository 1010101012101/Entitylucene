Why does USB audio out mute after about 1 minute? <body> I am seeing the following behavior on a MacBook Air and an iMac.  We have external speakers set up that we connect to via USB  external sound card  speakers. When we initially connect, the audio works as per normal, sounds great. Then after about a minute it mutes completely, and won't turn on unless we reconnect the usb and select it again as the output. It's not iTunes or Spotify because using the volume up and down keys does not make any sound either.   The iMac started doing this 4 or 5 months ago and now it has just started on the MacBook Air. This also happens on the MacBook Air when I try to connect audio out to the external display I have connected to it, so I don't think its the sound card, I think it might be OS software related.

Another edit:   Turning off Bluetooth and WiFi had no effect - the problem still persists  <answer213371> I have problems with the Alesis M1Active 520USB speakers. After an undetermined amount of time they just stop working. Switching to internal speakers works fine. A reboot fixes it...but that's painful. The easier solution I've found is this:  ul liChange your sound source (option clicking the sound icon is the quickest method) to Internal Speakers./li liUnplug the speakers/li liOpen a terminal and run this command, which restarts the Core Audio Daemon: codesudo killall coreaudiod/code/li liPlug the speakers back in/li /ul  Maybe it will help you too.  <comment143126> so what does it say in the sound pannel <comment143128> everything is normal in the sound panel, I can see the external speakers, and they're still selected <comment143130> who/what else is in the sound pennel <comment143131> I just added a screenshot <comment143133> also just added some more info... <comment143134> just for fun disable the bluetooth! what 2 USB outputs ? <comment143141> Sorry I will try that when I get home tonight... 2nd USB is not shown on screenshot but is the Display Output for my second screen
