What happens when the total filesize of an iCloud drive exceeds the filesize of a physical drive? <body> I have 200 GB of iCloud storage, but my Mac only has a 128gb drive. Say that I would fill my iCloud drive, so that it would require more space to sync than what's available on my Mac. What would happen?  Dropbox has a feature called selective sync that allows you to select which folders get downloaded and synced with the each device, but iCloud drive do not seem to have anything similar.  <comment227982> Does someone know?
