Create app for customer <body> Is it possible to create a app and sell it to multiple customer? My intention is to create a generel app and then customize that app and sell it.  Then customer can buy that app.  And if the company is called ABC and the app is called myApp, then the app is called ABCmyApp  And a second question.  Is it posible for me to submit all the customers app so its my name on the app store?  Thank Jakob  <answer144627> This is indeed strongpossible./strong  If the emgeneric/em app of yours won't change in any aspect em(logic nor interface)/em between the different customers, you could just use different strongTargets/strong in Xcode. In each strongTarget/strong you'll be able to set different names and use different strongProvisioning Profiles/strong to publish the App.  In the same way, if all the strongProvisioning Profiles/strong you'd be using were of your developer account, the showing name in the emApp Store/em would be yours.   <comment170364> Thanks :) do you know how many of these app i will be able to publish on one account? If there is a limit <comment170374> @user2999692 As far as I know, there's no limit.
