Strange "open with" option in Safari <body> I have two applications on my Mac that will open DICOM files: OsiriX and Horos.  In response to a download and display request in Safari, I get the message shown in this screenshot:  http://207.254.60.104/WebShare/OpenHoros/OpenHoros.png  The request is:  codeosirix://?methodName=DownloadURL&amp;Display=YES&amp;URL='http://207.254.60.XXX:3333/wado?requestType=WADO&amp;studyUID=1.2.826.0.1.3680043.9.5830.1.XXX&amp;token=5EA4A2D69BC4AA5BB4A2CD303B7FE041' /code  (XXXs for anonymization purposes)  It previously would simply download the data into Osirix and display them. Now, suddenly, I get the option to open the data with Horos only.  This doesn't happen with Chrome.  Update 12/22/16: It's happening with Chrome, too. Chrome opens the Horos app.  hr  Second update: 12/22/16  Firefox Preferences still permits explicit specification of Applications. When I checked this, I got the following:  http://dsh.re/4893b  hr  I changed this to "OsiriX" which has solved the issue for that browser. So, I've confirmed that "something" has set Horos.app as a Default. I just have to determine how to change that.  Ideas?  <answer265895> Have you tried downloading a DICOM file locally and then right clicking - open with - Other and then choosing Osirix and checking always use this app? I've had to do this before once; somehow OS X file associations got overwritten after an upgrade.   <answer265904> I used RCDefault.app to fix this. Yes, Horos was listed as the URL Handler for OsiriX. I don't know how this came to be.  I confirm that RCDefault does work in macOSSierra (10.12.2) â€” at least for this purpose. (I read somewhere that it wasn't working in Sierra.)
