How to remove duplicate icons from launchpad? <body> I have two identical xCode icons on the launchpad screen. I guess the second icon appeared after installing xCode beta version.  So here my steps for reproducing this issue:  ol liInstall xCode 7 /li liinstall xCode 8/li liinstall xCode 7 again./li /ol  I tried this but it does not help me. I have El Capitan 10.11.6 Do you know how can I remove it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y97lZ.jpg" alt="two xCode icons"  <answer252787> This helped me. Try to move the Xcode App to Trash and put it back.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12519772/two-xcode-app-icons-in-launchpad-after-4-5-install  <comment308355> Have you held the icon still they start shaking, and then pressing the little `x`?
