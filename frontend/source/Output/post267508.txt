Installing OS X - same version, different builds <body> My iMac Late 2012 model initially came with OS X 10.8.5 Mountain Lion installed with a build of 12F45. I just obtained a install disk of 10.8 that has the same version but with Build 12F37. If I decide to reformat my hard drive and do an install of ML with the the same disk, could I do so without having to worry about getting a No symbol?  <comment335668> You said "_I just obtained a install disk of 10.8_", well Apple doesn't make an install disc for OS X 10.8, it's delivered via the Mac App Store as an installer app. Anyway OS X 10.8 should work on any iMac from Mid 2007 or newer. <comment335673> @user3439894 While 10.8 in general should work, builds before 12F45 may miss drivers required for the late 2012 iMac model. OTOH this model should already have a recovery partition to allow for an easy OS reinstall. <comment335677> @patrix, The System Requirements for [OS X Mountain Lion](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/D6377Z/A/os-x-mountain-lion) via the Mac App Store state "iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)". <comment335687> @user3439894 The version available in the Store may be an even higher/more recent build than 12F45 or 12F37. The question asks whether a late 2012 iMac will boot with 12F37. If the machine originally was delivered with 12F45 this is at least questionable. <comment335690> @patrix, thanks for the answer. Appreciated,
