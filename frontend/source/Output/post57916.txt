How do you remove Safari 6 on Mac OS X 10.7.4 <body> I understand there was a uninstaller for Safari 6 beta (is that available anywhere?) but it seems no longer available in the Apple Dev Center, and I am on Safari 6 release version.  I need to remove this and revet back to 5.1.7.  <answer57919> if you want to revert to Safari 5.1.7 this link should allow you to download the version directly.  I am not sure how to remove all traces or 'remaining parts' of Safari 6, but the link above is the manual installer DMG for Safari 5.1.7 for OS X Lion.  emHave not tried it, although the link is from Softpedia./em  <answer57957> The uninstaller(s) for the Safari betas are indeed available presently in the developer downloads section. You can get the version there for whatever version you had installed. If you do not have an OS X Developer account yet you can register under http://developer.apple.com/ for free.  If you used the currently shipping version, there is no uninstaller. Using the uninstaller for a different version would probably yield undesired results.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xi7hv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer58052> Unfortunately, I am now on Mountain Lion, so I can't confirm this works myself, but some searching found some options for you:  ol liIf you have a backup from before you installed Safari 6, use that to revert./li liThe Safari installer places a backup of the old Safari in code/Library/Application Support/Apple/code named .SafariArchive.tar.gz.  Note that since the name starts with a dot, it's not visible in Finder.  Doing an codels -a/code, or setting Finder to display hidden files via codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code followed by restarting Finder will let you see the file.  Once you've unpacked it take a backup, as you'll have to copy the older Safari's various support files into place.  The unpacked file will have many folders that overlap with files on your Mac's root folder.  To delete the Safari.app (TAKE A BACKUP, FOR REALS), you'll have to go into a Terminal, navigate to code/Applications/code and run codesudo rm -rf Safari.app//code.  Copy the unpacked files into place, and you're golden./li /ol  <answer59342> To downgrade Safari 6 on OS X Lion (10.7.4) to Safari 5.1.7:  ol liUse Time Machine to have a fresh backup!/li liGet Pacifist./li liGet Safari 5.1.7 for Lion here (apple.com)  or here (mirror).   precode$ md5 Downloads/Safari5.1.7LionManual.dmg MD5 (Safari5.1.7LionManual.dmg) = 504bdd1629f660084725d9883629f58e (same for both download links) /code/pre /li liQuit Safari if running./li liInstall Safari 5.1.7 using Pacifist.

The last one (WebInspector.framework) and possibly the first one (SafariServices.framework) don't really need to be disabled; Safari 5.1.7 will start anyway (at least for me), but since they weren't there before 6.0, I disabled them, too. /li liLaunch Safari./li liIf you're happy with your newly downgraded Safari, you might safely delete those .disabled folders/frameworks. They will be reinstalled if you ever choose to install Safari 6 again. Look for the disabled frameworks (e.g. "SafariServices.framework.disabled") and move them to the Trash. You will be asked for your admin user's password again.

The challenge is in finding it (Apple Developer Download looks like it was a good source, but its not appearing under Crash Wrangler like the screenshot above anymore - probably removed...) - most copies on the internet (which aren't supposed to be there anyways) have been taken down, I found it a couple of places still doing a search on the file name and the first return had it (although it was non user friendly site - pop up windows etc.) and also via a search on "Safari 6 uninstaller" and results about 26 returns down the way, some steve guy's website.  <comment66648> Thanks, I have that, but the 5.1.7 installer does not allow you to overwrite version 6.  An uninstaller is required for 6, and I'm desperately seeking it. <comment66653> @Ashley I have looked around forums online and have not found an uninstaller - however there must be some way of uninstalling Safari 6. Sorry for the inconvenience! <comment66656> Cheers.  I've e-mail the Apple dev's, just don't know how long it'll take to get a reply. <comment66664> There isn't an uninstaller for the final version. The only way to safely replace it will be to reinstall OS X Lion. However, 10.7.5 will likely ship with it, so you may find it difficult to avoid version 6 for too much longer. <comment66676> @Ashley If you get any information on uninstalling Safari 6 please add the information either in an update to your original post or as a new answer. <comment66682> I will do if I remember.  Bookmarked :o) <comment66785> Thanks.  I have a developer account but Safari doesn't show as a Category for some reason.  I'll leave things as is and wait for fixes I guess. <comment68630> +1. It's good to know about `/Library/Application Support/Apple`. <comment69445> This safe? and would work having safari 6 again running Software Update? <comment69804> I experimented a lot before I finally came to this solution. I e.g. incrementally installed every Safari 5 version I could get, re-installed 10.7.4 combo upgrade, etc. and I was able to re-upgrade to Safari 6 by Software Update after each try. **Of** **course** I had a Time Machine **backup** before I started, didn't need it thou. <comment69805> One of the key changes is Safari.framework that has moved from `PrivateFrameworks/` to `StagedFrameworks/Safari/` in Safari 6. Even when the Safari 5 installer copies a new copy to PrivateFrameworks, Safari5.app uses the Staged -one and it doesn't have some components it needs to run, that are removed in Safari 6. <comment73259> Just out of curiosity, why do you want to revert back? <comment126641> +1. Best approach for me. Reinstalling `Safari6.0.5Lion.pkg` corrupted it big time so getting it back from `.SafariArchive.tar.gz` was the only solution (I needed to revert from 6.1 to 6.0.5). If you use Path Finder you don't even have to use terminal, just unpack and replace the folders. <comment127155> This worked for me.  Everything is 100% safe. <comment232950> Why would we want to revert back?  Is it that Safari 6 is no longer getting updates for security vulnerabilities?
