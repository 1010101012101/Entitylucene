"Last backup could not be completed" when "Last backup: Never" <body> I have deleted all major iCloud backups and removed Camera Roll etc. from the impending backup so it should be less than 5 GB. Even still, when I re-enable iCloud Backup and go to sync for the first time, I'm told that the "Last backup could not be completed". Tried power cycling and still no change. What gives?  <answer254630> From the date of your post, you were using iOS 9 at the time. I experienced this issue myself with backups in iOS 9. Forcing another iCloud backup would eventually allow it to complete, but over time I had to deal with runaway backup sizes (growing up to upwards of 5 GiBs after a few days).  As far as I can tell, this appears to be resolved at last in iOS 10. I would recommend performing a backup in iTunes, then upgrading before trying another iCloud backup.  <comment313630> Are you able to backup to your computer with a cable or is it just iCloud backups that don't work? <comment313641> @fbara, just iCloudâ€”manual computer backup is fine <comment317095> In iOS 10, I get "This iPhone cannot be backed up because there is not enough iCloud storage available" (free iCloud space: 4.9 GB, tentative "next backup size": 6 GB). I removed all apps  40 MB and now the backup image is 4.8 GB, so it fits but barely. Still unclear what is taking up most of that 5 GB backup, though I imagine it's Messages. <comment317098> Could be messages; on my phone my Health database was also very large, from using an Apple Watch and getting heart rate and step/distance measurements every few seconds.
