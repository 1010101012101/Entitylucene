Can I find just the apps which I have purchased in the App Store? <body> I know I can go to the Purchased tab in the App Store on my iPad to see all the apps that I have downloaded, but I have been unable to find a way to see emjust/em the apps that I have embought/em.  Is there a way to sort the apps in the iOS App Store so that one can easily view all the empaid/em apps that have been downloaded?  <answer91652> I don't know of any way to do this using the App Store.  I look through my email receipts for this information.  <comment165847> It the app was purchased using funds loaded by voucher there won't be any email receipts, or will there? I seem to recall only getting receipts when paying by credit card. <comment165871> I have quite a few receipts which say "Billed To: Store Credit". <comment165981> You're right, I've found that I have ones billed to store credit too. So that's a way I can do this.
