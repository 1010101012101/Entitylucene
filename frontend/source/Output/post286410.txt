How do I enter commands in single-user mode? <body> After every command line do I have to press enter and wait for it to end before I go to the next one? I have no clue at all and am desperate to solve this problem. This is my first time using single-user mode.  precode/sbin/fsck -fy / /sbin/mount -uw / mkdir /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions cd /Disabled_System_Library_Extensions mv /System/Library/Extensions/ATI* . mv /System/Library/Extensions/AMD* . touch /System/Library/Extensions exit /code/pre  <answer286412> After you've typed a line, press the enter key. Wait until the command has finished before typing the next line and repeating. If you've ever used Terminal, it is the identical process.  <comment361369> And yes you have to wait for each command to finish
