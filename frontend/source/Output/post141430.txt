How to persist the display arrangement of multiple thunderbolt displays daisy chainded? <body> My setup is:  MacBookAir, OS X 10.9.4 (13E28) and two Thunderbolt displays. It seems that the arrangement of the displays after reconnecting thunderbold or restarting device is rather randomly especialy when the devices where powered off in between.  I' am aware that i might rearrange the displays using System Preferences-Displays-Arrangment.  But what I miss is to define which is my main screen (holding icons on desktop) and how to save the arrangement to be persistent over restart of mac osx and reconnect with thunderbolt displays (that no have been powered on since last connect.)  Thanks
