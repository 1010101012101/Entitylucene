Shoud I upgrade to Safari 6.1? <body> I have a Lion machine and a Mountain Lion machine. Software Update has offered to upgrade Safari from 6.0.5 to 6.1 on both machines. Is this upgrade worth it? Any issues or glitches? I didn't find any comments on this upgrade on the web.  <answer108419> Upgrading to latest software version is emgenerally/em a good idea for security and performance reasons.  Specifically Safari 6.1 brings its lot of security fixes: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6000?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US.  In terms of functionalities, Safari 6.1 brings the following:  ul liShared Links: See links shared by people you follow on Twitter;/li liNew sidebar (Reading List, Bookmarks and Shared Links to the left of the browser; can be hidden);/li liOne-click bookmarking;/li li(Performance enhancements) Safari Power Saver: Only play content from accepted plug-ins;/li /ul  See more here: http://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/22/apple-releases-safari-6-1-for-mountain-lion-with-shared-links-new-sidebar-power-saver-and-more/.
