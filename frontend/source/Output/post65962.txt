Can Apple mail only sync the last month of a Exchange email? <body> I just synced my Mountain Lion Mail app with my Exchange work email account in order to have it locally on my machine (rather than continuously going through the web interface). However, now Mail fetches all the mails since the very beginning (which are a couple of years).  Is there a way (like on iOS devices) to tell Mail to only sync the last month or something configurable amount based on message count, download size or other similar restriction to prevent all messages from being stored locally?  <answer93676> Try going to MailMAilboxRebuild on each folder.  It will force a resync  <comment113073> Can you adjust your answer to answer the question?
