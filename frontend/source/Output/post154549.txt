Automator is not able to highlight text with click and drag using "Watch Me Do.action" <body> I am using automator with the codeWatch Me Do.action/code to scrape text from an very old application. Everything works okay, except that when i click on text and highlight it, it wont register the highlighting of the text.  Is this not supported by the codeWatch Me Do.action/code? If not how do i solve it?  <comment181830> did you turn on "Access for assistive devices." ? <comment181831> @Buscarì›ƒ, it is enabled for `Automator`.. Is there anything else i should turn on? <comment181832> The mouse movement works fine, but i cant really click and highlight anything, it does not register this behavior.
