Numbers: how to search only within a selected range? <body> I have a very big table, and searching for a string can take a few seconds. However, I only want to search in a particular column. Even when a column is selected, Numbers searches the entire table. How can I constrain the search to the selected column?  <answer249544> You can filter data in numbers using filtering data , in that you can select the row/column set the rule , keyword to be searched can be set there itself. For more details Link  <comment309760> If nothing else exists I guess that'll have to do, but then I can't look at surrounding data if I want easily (since it's filtered). So no way to just constrain the search?
