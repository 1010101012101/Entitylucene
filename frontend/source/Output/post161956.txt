To create a new apple ID on another iPhone <body> Now my wife is holding iPhone 5S. She can't remember even though she created Apple ID and I cloud mail. She asked me, please create an Apple ID for her on my iPhone. Because I am working on abroad. Let me know how to create an Apple ID on another iPhone.   <answer161960> You can create a new Apple Id on My Apple Id website. Just click on Create a New Apple Id and follow the instructions.  In that website you can also Reset your password, that maybe it's a better option.  <comment189224> don't create another, find out the details for the first one. Start at http://iforgot.apple.com
