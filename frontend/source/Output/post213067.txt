Set Preview to open PDFs in Thumbnail View by default on El Capitan <body> I can find nowhere to set Preview to default to Thumbnail View with all PDFs.  I use them every day. I have ticked Thumbnails in the View menu but it does nothing. Does anyone know how to set the default?  <answer213075> Have you tried setting Preview to always open with the sidebar? You can do this in Preview menu  Preferences  PDF tab and selecting the checkbox for "Always show sidebar".  <answer214160> Thanks SamH. Have you tried setting Preview to always open with the sidebar? You can do this in Preview menu  Preferences  PDF tab and selecting the checkbox for "Always show sidebar".  I don't have that option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jswzF.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer280541> Right click, select Get info, select open with, set default   <comment259830> You can see the screen shot - it does not have that option either?
