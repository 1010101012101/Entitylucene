How can I convert a Mac locale file to something human readable? <body> I'd like to see what's in the LC_CTYPE files in em/usr/share/locale/*/em, but they are binary files. Is there a tool that will make a human readable version, or a specification of their format somewhere?  I'm mostly interested in seeing what each locale puts in the various POSIX named character classes.  I would have liked to tag this "locale", but apparently that tag doesn't exist and I don't have the rep for it.  <comment329522> Using the file command it should tell you what they are. Possibly a gettext file. <comment329526> No such luck with file. <comment329532> This may be of interest then, since it's not gettext, but C's locale lib: https://linux.die.net/man/1/localedef
