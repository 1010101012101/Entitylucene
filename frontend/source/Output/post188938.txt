iMessage stuck in Notification Center <body> I have this weird situation where I was using the reply-from-Notification-Center Messages feature and it got stuck in the write-the-message state, as in the screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RMBfT.png" alt="enter image description here"   The message was sent, but ever since it got stuck and it’s unusable.  How can I reset it without restarting the computer or logging out?  (I’m on Mavericks.)  <answer188955> I was able to fix this by killing Notification Center with the following command:  precodekillall NotificationCenter /code/pre  You could also force-quit it from Activity Monitor.  Source.  <comment223756> Can you open console, reproduce problem and save the output to pastebin.com? <comment223762> have you tried to force quit? <comment223776> @Gabkano force quit what? Notification Center? Is it possible? <comment223777> @TheBro21 No, I can’t reproduce the problem, since is stuck in that state, so I can’t write any new messages from the interface. <comment223778> force quit iMesage <comment223779> @Gabkano Messages works flawlessly. It opens and it closes without problems. <comment223781> after you completely closed iMessage with the option "close iMessage" found in the option-bar called "iMessage" in the top of the screen, the notification still doesn't disappear?   Why can't you restart or log out which would be the best and fastest solution? <comment223783> @Gabkano Yes, exactly, after quitting Messages, the notification still doesn’t disappear. I was able to fix it by killing Notification Center (see my own answer to the question).
