Any way to make phone calls with an old iPhone using continuity <body> I just got an iPhone 6 Plus and I have set up my old iPhone 5 as an iPod. I'm a college student and having an extra screen to display notes or my textbook can come in handy. After setting up the iPhone 5 for the Continuity feature, I am able to send and receive SMS texts and I am able to receive landline phone calls, through the iPhone 6 Plus's cell signal. However, I cannot make outgoing phone calls, as the phone defaults to its own cellular antenna, rather than using the iPhone 6 Plus's, generating an invalid account error message from my carrier.  Details: iPhone 5 running iOS 8.1 - Actually my wife's old phone, so the phone number tied to it is different than the number tied to the iPhone 6 Plus (I tried to use my old phone, but I could never get Message to authenticate. I'm thinking my phone number being tied to both devices was the issues there.). iPhone 6 Plus running iOS 8.1.1  So, the big question, Is there anything I can do to get the calls working in both directions on the iPhone 5, with Continuity?  It would be nice, since the iPhone 5 is more comfortable to hold for long conversations. I guess I can always call someone and then ask them to call me back if looks like I'm going to get my ear chewed off.  Also, the iPhone 5 is out of warranty, so any solution, even a jailbreak tweak would be welcome.  Thanks in advance.
