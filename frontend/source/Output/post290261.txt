What is the proper form for "cert_identifier" when using "certupdate"? <body> The required options for codecertupdate/code seem to have changed in macOS Sierra Server or before, and the manpages have not caught up yet.  When trying:  precodecertupdate remove -c /etc/certificates/secure.domain.com.1234567890123456789012345678901234567890.cert.pem /code/pre  br certupdate throws this error:  precodecertupdate[92173:961471] Unable to recreate the missing certificate ID for /etc/certificates/secure.domain.com.1234567890123456789012345678901234567890.cert.pem error = 2 /code/pre  brIf you just use codecertupdate/code by itself you get:  precodecertupdate remove [-c cert_path] [-p cert_persistent_ref_base64] -i cert_identifier certupdate replace -c old_cert_path [-p old_cert_persistent_ref_base64] -C new_cert_path [-P new_cert_persistent_ref_base64] -i old_cert_identifier -I new_cert_identifier /code/pre  br which says that now code-i/code and code-I/code are required, though not mentioned in the manpages or anywhere online that I can find.  Unfortunately, I've been unable to construct a proper cert_identifier for use with either version of codecertupdate/code and have tried to use codesecure.domain.com.[SHA-1]/code with and without various extensions, various paths including code/etc/certificates/code, but to no avail. I also asked codesecurity/code to find the certificate, hoping it would show some kind of clue, but it did not.  The only thing I've found is that asking codeserveradmin/code about websites reveals a key called codeweb:defaultSecureSite:mstCertificateIdentifier/code which contains a SHA-256 hash and the domain, but no combination I made of that works, either.  Does anybody have any idea how to use codecertupdate/code now that these options are required?
