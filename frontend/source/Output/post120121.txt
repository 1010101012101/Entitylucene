How to boot Macbook Pro when in closed clamshell mode without the windows getting resized <body> I have a mid 2012 MacBook Pro that I use an external 1440p monitor/keyboard/mouse with.  Another question shows it's not possible to boot it without opening the lid. When I do this, all of my windows resize/move to fit the 900p internal display, messing up my work environment every time I bring my computer from sleep.  Is there anyway around this?  <answer120225> With my 2007 MBP I can get it out of sleep by clicking a mouse button or key on my external keyboard with the lid closed. No problem.   On a cold boot, I press the power button and then close the lid as fast as I can, and then it boots up on the external monitor with no ill effects.  Should work that way for any MBP!  <comment140137> Posting this as a comment because my laptop is older than yours but if it's correct I'll make it an answer.

Do either of these work for you? <comment140245> Yes, this does work! :)
