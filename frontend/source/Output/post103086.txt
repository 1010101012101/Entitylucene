All contacts disappeared from my iPad 2 <body> Sometime overnight, all of my contacts have disappeared from my iPad 2. All contacts are still available on my iPhone 4s and my 4supth/sup-generation iPod touch. I do use iCloud sync but I can't seem to get the contacts back on my iPad. What do I need to do to get my contacts back?  <answer103114> Go to settingsiCloud, and turn on contacts and everything else you want to come over from iCloud.  This should bring them all back.  <comment121360> What did you try to restore the contacts?
