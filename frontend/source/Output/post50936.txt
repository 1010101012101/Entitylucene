Gimp keeps on crashing with SIGSEGV error <body> I am trying out Mac Gimp 2.8 as an alternative to Photoshop. I've been wanting to go for more OS stuff and wondered if Gimp would play nice. It seems both Photoshop and Gimp get the same error working with text. As soon as I try to work with my fonts in Gimp I get:  precodeProcess:         X11.bin [2865] Path:            /Applications/Utilities/X11.app/Contents/MacOS/X11.bin Identifier:      org.x.X11

I need to get some work done here and it just crashes as soon as I have selected a font and tried to add some text. I also wonder if the PS and Gimp errors are related.  strikeI do have around 300 fonts installed. Macs and Gimp or Photoshop won't choke on that amount now will they..?!/strike When I load Gimp running onder Xquartz based on the MacPorts package after I added all the new fonts it did not crash. So this could be an Apple X11 issue or other Apple native code issue as Gimp 2.8 running under Apple's X11 naively is still crashing.  strongUpdate/strong  Still no fix. Just got a new crash. See http://pastebin.com/i7DtHMVD . Again tried to edit text in Gimp and failed.  strongUpdate 2/strong Added latest Xquartz and upgraded OS to Lion. All is good now.  <answer50943> I experienced the same issue with Gimp. Installing quartz 2.7.1 and then a log out and back in to point at xquartz instead of Apple's x11 has helped.  The text tool now works for me on Gimp v2.8.  <answer51507> SIGSEGV is a signal that is sent from the operating system to a program notifying that it that is has accessed an invalid memory address. Since this is done by the program itself, there is really nothing that you a user can do to fix it. This is a bug in the software and someone familiar with the source code can probably easily fix it. I would suggest filing a bug report for the bug, if it hasn't already been filed, otherwise all you can do is sit and wait for it to be fixed.  <comment58377> How would you make it point to Quartz 2.71? Is Photoshop crashing using fonts because of this X11 Apple issue as well? <comment58379> I also have Gimp 2.6 on Xquartz 2.3.6 based on MacPorts and there I do not have any issues. So I guess Xquartz does help. I just wanted to run the latest version and MP does not have it yet. If Apple's X11 is really the issue here it might cause both Photoshop and Gimp 2.8 on Mac to crash. Would be great to kill to birds with one stone, but I doubt I can get Photoshop to use Xquartz instead of Apple's X11 <comment58880> Installed latest Xquartz and latest OSX Lion and now all good. You were right. Thanks!
