Process list with name and VPRVT <body> Is there any way to get just name and VPRVT of running processes?  <answer85045> You could always restrict the columns Activity Monitor shows by right clicking the a column and deselect everything except Virtual Private Memory  img src="https://i.imgur.com/8RHgtu1.png" alt="screenshot of Activity Monitor"  <answer85154> precodetop -stats command,vprvt -l1 | sed '1,/^COMMAND *VPRVT/d' /code/pre  code-stats/code = shown columns, code-l1/code = exit after one sample. It cuts off long command names and uses human-readable sizes though.  <comment97934> Something like `ps -o pid,vsz` or are you looking for help running AppleScript to call unix commands? <comment97959> Yes something like that. I tried your code, but all i got was 2 numbers. My AppleScript needs name and VPRVT of every running process. Thanks <comment98076> @bmike vsz (vsize / total virtual memory available) is not vprvt (used virtual private memory). top without arguments has columns for both. <comment98097> @LauriRanta you are totally correct. My fishing lessons were quite vague here - more there are several manuals than RTFM. <comment98169> do shell script "top -stats command,vprvt -l1 -o vprvt | sed '1,/^COMMAND *VPRVT/d'" Thanks Lauri, your code is what i was looking for. I figured out how to sort by vprvt. It could show longer process names too and for some reason, it shows all my running AppleScripts as "applet".
