What is "xART Remote Storage Daemon" in macOS? <body> I found in my newly installed macOS system there is a service running on port 61500 and the process command is code/usr/libexec/xartstorageremoted/code  I issued codeman xartstorageremoted/code and found the manual of this deamon. After reading it I still don't understand what is this deamon used for. I searched Google and there is nearly nothing about it. Does anyone know something about it? What it used for in a common user's perspective?     The xartstorageremoted executable is a daemon intended to listen for save/fetch requests from the CoProcessor. This daemon is required for multi-partitions and multi-users support.      xartstorageremoted must not be unloaded and should only be run via launchd when a request must be handled.   <answer264797> In the MacBook's with Touch Bar there is a new processor, Apple’s T1 processor.    The deamon codexartstorageremoted/code talks with the T1 processor.   Secure Enclave is part of it meaning it’s tied explicitly to the Touch Bar and Touch ID. It’s also in charge of your webcam, a small but important difference.
