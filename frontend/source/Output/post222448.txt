How can I script inverting screen colors? <body> And, more generally, how can I change accessibility settings via the command line?  Worth pointing out that I'm pretty comfortable with bash already- coming from a systems administration / *nix background- but I just don't know which files to edit or tools to use.  To clarify, I am not asking this question, the resolution of which modifies a setting under Security and Privacy. What I want to do is change a setting directly under Accessibility. I'll grant the title of that question is misleadingly similar, but the content is entirely divorced from my intent.  <answer222626> ul liIf it's okay to give codeTerminal.app/code permanent access to codeAccessibility/code:  ol liOpen codeSystem Preferences/code/li liGo to codeSecurity &amp; Privacy/code section/li liIn codePrivacy/code tab, click on the lock in bottom left and enter your password to enable editing/li liSelect codeAccessibility/code from left side list and then check codeTerminal/code checkbox in right side list (if there is no codeTerminal/code checkbox here you might run step 5 once and then back to this step)/li liOpen codeTerminal/code and run this line (it uses AppleScript):  precode osascript -e "tell application \"System Preferences\"" -e "activate" -e "reveal anchor \"Seeing_Display\" of pane id \"com.apple.preference.universalaccess\"" -e "tell application \"System Events\" to tell process \"System Preferences\"" -e "click the checkbox \"Invert colors\" of window \"Accessibility\"" -e "end tell" -e "quit" -e "end tell" /code/pre  repeating previous steps for the future is not needed./li /ol/li liIf it's not okay to give direct access:  ol liOpen codeSystem Preferences/code/li liGo to codeKeyboard/code section/li liIn codeShortcuts/code tab, Select codeAccessibility/code from left side list and then check codeInvert colors/code in right side list (Default shortcut is codectrl/code+codealt/code+codecmd/code+code8/code)./li liOpen codeTerminal/code and run this line (it uses AppleScript):  precode osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\"" -e "key code 28 using {control down, option down, command down}" -e "end tell" /code/pre  repeating previous steps for the future is not needed./li /ol/li /ul  You can write those codes in external script files and run with codeosascript invertColors.scpt/code  <answer291533> strongto invert:/strong codeprintf '\e[?5h'/code  hr  strongto un-invert:/strong codeprintf '\e[?5l'/code  <comment369559> I know how to use terminal escape sequences. That's not the question I'm asking. Please try to understand what's being asked before you answer. :P <comment369590> ah you mean the entire screen. I have never used mac, but this is still useful if you want your terminal to flash after updating (what do you mac'ers use? homebrew?). Sorry about that and good luck with the osascripting. Also, after reading your question a second time, it still looks a bit like you meant the terminal if reading quickly.
