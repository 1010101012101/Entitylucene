How can one filter MULTIPLE processes in Activity Monitor? <body> How can I look at several processes at once, instead of just one?  For exampleâ€¦ typing in codebash/code, shows codebash/code processes.. how to I show both codebash/code and say codehttpd/code?  First thoughts.. codebash|httpd/code, no.  Or codebash httpd/code, no.  Long story short, nothing i tried worked.  Is it possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/InbVh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer39269> This doesn't seem to be possible with Activity Monitor. Unfortunately codetop/code doesn't accept several pids to monitor either, so you have to revert to a half-manual (and rather unelegant) solution using Terminal:  precodewhile :; do     clear     top -l 1 -pid PID-TO-MONITOR | tail -1     top -l 1 -pid ANOTHER-PID-TO-MONITOR | tail -1     sleep 5 done /code/pre  Given some basic bash skills you can wrap this into a shell script if needed often.  Or open several terminal windows and run codetop/code on specific processes in each of them. Might be kind of heavy on your CPU though...  <answer135451> To supplement @Patrix command line suggestion: use codegrep/code to match multiple PIDs by name. For example:  codetop -s 2  -l 5 | grep -w 'bash\|httpd'/code  Samples processes matching either codebash/code or codehttpd/code every code2/code seconds over code5/code queries (10 seconds total to run).  More generally:  codetop -s [interval time in seconds]  -l [# of intervals] | grep -w 'process1\|process2\|process3'/code  <comment44414> What are you ultimately trying to achieve? Command-line tools `top` and `ps` list running processes. Depending on what you're trying to do, perhaps running one of those commands and filtering the output with `grep` would be a better solution. <comment44427> its just nice to keep an eye on "some processes" rather than "just one" or "all of them"....  but as is often the case, apple almost deliberately seems to disable access to any sort of usable sorting or filtering syntax - although it's all there, underneath the skin..  instead strong-arming "simplicity" - over clever, and unobtrusive implementations that would let people who need "more meta" - have it. <comment75502> thanks for the answer, although the result is pretty icky...  `22057  mdworker 0.0  08:01.26 6   3   67+    267+   24M+  46M+  37M+  100M+ 2512M+ 22057 477  stuck 501 4711582+ 563+ 2541479+ 698439+ 9115613+ 4938769+ 1364892+ 35330+  18K+  95M+  localadmin` etc..  but it refreshes like a madman.. limiting the usefullness.  oh well, accepted until something dreamier comes along :-).
