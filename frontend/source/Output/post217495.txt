What is a quick way to duplicate a tab in Safari? <body> Is there a quick way or shortcut to duplicate a tab in Safari?  <answer217496> I have two alternatives:  ol liPress kbdCmd/kbd+kbdL/kbd (go the Location/Search field), then kbdCmd/kbd+kbdReturn/kbd./li liClick the back button (code&lt;/code), then press kbdCmd/kbd while clicking the forward button (code&gt;/code)./li /ol  Both of these will open a tab in the background. (Often, kbdCmd/kbd + emclick/em opens the click target's reference in a new tab.)  If you also press kbdShift/kbd while performing the second step of either of these alternatives, the tab will open in the foreground.  <answer217498> Hold codecmd/code then press codeL/code, after that codeC/code, after that codeT/code, after that codeV/code and finally release codecmd/code and press codeenter/code. Usually use this so i'm an expert in this and can do this under a milisec. :D Or you make an automator workflow with this.  <answer217500> If you don't want to use several key inputs there's a plugin for just duplication. I can't recall the name of it just now but I have used it before.  strongEdit:/strong Found a plugin that does what you're looking for, it's not the one I have personally used for a long time but still does what you want. Pugin: http://thiemo.ch/safari/  <answer217529> codecmd/code + code[/code to go back one page, then hold codecmd/code and strongclick the forward arrow/strong to open a new tab of the page you were just on.  <answer217563> I believe that strongTetsujin/strong has the best answer (see above).  I read the above tips and tried several. Not noticing his tip at first I accidentally found the same solution, but for it to work this way you must have Safari's preferences set appropriately.   I am using El Capitan, OS X 10.11.1 and Safari 9.01. This tip works because we previously 1) opened Safari's Preferences dialog strong(Cmd/Comma)/strong, 2) selected the strongemTabs/em/strong tab, 3) strongset/strong the strongem"Open pages in tabs instead of windows"/em/strong drop-down list box to strongAutomatically/strong and 4) strongenabled/strong the strongthree check boxes/strong just below that. What this does is mostly self-explanatory - text in the dialog box tells what each choice means.  strongCmd/L, Cmd/Return/strong - strongthat's the entire tip!/strong.  Simple isn't it?  strongCmd/L/strong means emOpen Location/em and has the effect of opening the current  URL in Safari's Smart Search field and selects it.    strongCmd/Return/strong means emOpen a page in a new tab/em. The URL in the Smart Search field opens in a new tab.  You can type this as 1) press  strongCmd/strong and hold it while 2) you press strongL/strong then 3) release strongL/strong and press strongReturn/strong. You then 4) release both the strongCmd/strong and strongReturn/strong keys and you are done.    These two sets of keypresses will create a duplicate of the tab you are on and make it active.  <answer217564> ol likbd⌘/kbd + kbdL/kbd/li likbd⌘/kbd + kbdEnter/kbd/li /ol  strongHow it works/strong: The first step "Highlights the URL." (File  Open Location...). The second step "Opens the URL in a new background tab."  I'm usually a Chrome user, but I just tested it. It works on Safari, too. I can't find a reference for Safari, but here is that for Chrome. (under Mac  Address bar shortcuts)  strongEdit/strong: Trauts beat me to it while I was formatting the key glyph.

But it's only a copy of the current URL, it's not a copy of the tab: I can't navigate backwards in the copied tab.  <comment262912> Oh Chrome, how I love the fact I can just right click on a tab and select "Duplicate". <comment262942> Cmd/L, Cmd/Return, for me. You don't even need to let go of Cmd. <comment262969> Would draging the favicon to the tab bar work? <comment263001> It does not require 2 separate steps, just simple press literally ⌘+L+Enter (⌘+L+Return) in one action and it duplicates the Tab. <comment263003> @Gabi - take a look at the top answer...  will save yourself a few unnecessary keystrokes there :) <comment263051> @IsmaelMiguel In El Capitan, getting at the favicon is not easy. First you have to click the location field, then you have to aim for the favicon, and then drag it to the tab placeholder marked `+`, which is also small and difficult to aim for. It works, but it is not a "quick way". <comment263052> How is it possible to be that cumbersome to do the basic stuff: a drag-and-drop? But you didnt specify it is on El Capitan. You said "Safari", nothing else. <comment263055> @IsmaelMiguel For a keyboard oriented person, a shortcut is often faster because the fingers don't have to be moved to the pointing device and one can rely on muscle memory instead of aiming. When the targets are small, drag and drop becomes more cumbersome. (The question relates to Safari in general, but my comment relates to Safari El Capitan, which is the only release I can test.) <comment263112> You have a very good point there. It becomes even harder when the target is 32x32 on a Retina screen (which has 2x the DPI of a regular screen, i think). But, for a not-so-tech-savyy person, the drag-and-drop **MAY** be a **bit** easier (on another operating system as well). But physical impaired people will also find your method easier, depending on the physical abilities of the person. But would `F6 + (hold CMD) + C + T + V + (release CMD) + Enter/Return` be easier? <comment263175> @Charlie74 yes, there are some unnecessary steps but usually I'm too lazy to use the mouse :) <comment263803> I like the bookmarklet and the hotkey tip. <comment265770> How does ⌘⇧Return differ from ⌘Return? <comment265847> It opens in a new foreground tab. ⌘Return opens in a background tab. <comment266156> Works in Chrome too. <comment341798> I think you're missing a new tab command somewhere? ⌘L,↩︎ just refreshes the existing tab. Did you mean ⌘L,⌘C,⌘T,⌘V,↩︎? <comment341906> I think your reply is better suited as a comment to an answer, not an answer in itself. You're right, though, as far as I know, none of the answers make a tab copy including the history. On the other hand, having a new tab with the current page will "free up" the original tab for history navigation.
