whats the volume slider in the multitasking bar for? <body> I have just upgraded to iOS 4.2.1 and I don't have an Apple TV so there's no Airplay button, however I still have a volume slider in the multitasking bar?  What volume does that change, and whats the point of it, I can just use the hardware buttons. (I'd much rather it was a brightness slider like there is on the iPad)  <answer4245> The volume changes the volume of the audio on your device, just like the hardware volume buttons do.  <comment4059> What device are you on? <comment4060> so theres no point in it? <comment4062> @Jonathan - it depends on what app you are using and if that app offers a volume slider. Technically, there is no point, but there is little you can do. There is no way, AFAIK to change it into a brightness slider. Good luck! <comment4063> well if the app doesnt have a slider you can use the hardware buttons <comment4064> @Jonathan - true. I'm not arguing with you or defending Apple, I'm merely explaining how their design was implemented. <comment4065> I know you weren't arguing. My keyboard run out of batteries and its very slow and aching to type with a mouse ;)
