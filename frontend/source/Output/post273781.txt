Where can I find all the documentation for mac's builtin shell commands? <body> The OS X Man Pages lists out all builtin functions. But where can I find the documentation of a particular one?  For instance, the command codefc/code, on ubuntu I can get its manual by:  precode&gt; help fc fc: fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last] or fc -s [pat=rep] [command] Display or execute commands from the history list.  fc is used to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list. FIRST and LAST can be numbers specifying the range, or FIRST can be a string, which means the most recent command beginning with that string. .... /code/pre  Another example is the codeif/code expression, on ubuntu:  precode&gt; help if if: if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; ]... [ else COMMANDS; ] fi Execute commands based on conditional. ... /code/pre  What am I missing here?  <answer273784> You do the exact same thing.  So...  precode$ help if if: if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; ]... [ else COMMANDS; ] fi     The `if COMMANDS' list is executed.  If its exit status is zero, then the     `then COMMANDS' list is executed.  Otherwise, each `elif COMMANDS' list is     executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding     `then COMMANDS' list is executed and the if command completes.  Otherwise,     the `else COMMANDS' list is executed, if present.  The exit status of the     entire construct is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero     if no condition tested true. /code/pre  Or...  precode$ help fc fc: fc [-e ename] [-nlr] [first] [last] or fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]     fc is used to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list.     FIRST and LAST can be numbers specifying the range, or FIRST can be a     string, which means the most recent command beginning with that     string.         -e ENAME selects which editor to use.  Default is FCEDIT, then EDITOR,           then vi.         -l means list lines instead of editing.        -n means no line numbers listed.        -r means reverse the order of the lines (making it newest listed first).      With the `fc -s [pat=rep ...] [command]' format, the command is     re-executed after the substitution OLD=NEW is performed.      A useful alias to use with this is r='fc -s', so that typing `r cc'     runs the last command beginning with `cc' and typing `r' re-executes     the last command. /code/pre  <comment344206> stupid me, I am on zsh where `help` is not a builtin <comment344236> Slightly unrelated to the question but I find the [tldr pages](https://tldr-pages.github.io/) command to be very useful for reading up on other commands in general :) <comment344266> you an also use the "man" command: "man fc" will give you the manual pages for the "fc" command <comment344270> `man fc` will give you the page for all builtin shell commands (for csh and sh) without any usage details of any of them. Basically, exactly what the OP linked to in the question. <comment344458> @Hoi_A Indeed tldr is a very handy tool with succinct examples. It just happens that some builtin functions were missing from tldr. E.g. `hash`, `fc` ,etc. Perhaps will open an issue there <comment344459> I did not know that, I always assumed they had covered all main commands. You could probably just add it to tldr directly instead of an issue since they welcome contributions :) <comment344478> `zsh` has it own help function called `run-help`. You will find information on setting up `run-help` in `man zshcontrib`. <comment373163> In zsh, use `man zshbuiltins`. <comment373164> In zsh, use `man zshbuiltins`.
