Allow app to edit /etc/hosts with the least amount of privileges <body> I start SelfControl from terminal using an invocation like:  precodeselfcontrol_start () {         defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl BlockDuration -int 120         defaults write org.eyebeam.SelfControl HostBlacklist -array facebook.com news.ycombinator.com         defaults read org.eyebeam.SelfControl         sudo /Applications/SelfControl.app/Contents/MacOS/org.eyebeam.SelfControl $(id -u $(whoami)) --install } /code/pre  It needs sudo because it edits code/etc/hosts/code but it's annoying to type my pw for this several times per day. I'm confident I can figure out how to make this work by giving the app root privileges but that's pretty heavy-handed. I heard about Apple's Authorization Services but I'm not sure how to use. Could this grant only the ability to edit code/ect/hosts/code for this app and if so, how?  Alternatively: other ideas?
