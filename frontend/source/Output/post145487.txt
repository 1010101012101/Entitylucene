How to enable/disable Do Not Disturb from shell on Mavericks <body> I would like to toggle the Do Not Disturb in the notification center with a keyboard shortcut.  I am using better touch tool for some extra keyboard shortcuts but it does not support enabling/disabling the notifications in the default options.  It has an option for executing a terminal command so I'm asking here how to enable/disable Do Not Disturb from the terminal?  I found this post and I tried to run the commands but it didn't seem to work.  strongEdit:/strong   I found out how to change it in the config file:  precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.A7CBDEFD-A69F-57AE-9F7B-496D40E34762.plist doNotDisturb 1 /code/pre  emNote that A7CBDEFD-A69F-57AE-9F7B-496D40E34762 is specific to my system./em  It toggles the value but it does not show it in the Notification Center. Also,  precodekillall NotificationCenter /code/pre  will restart the Notification Center with code0/code, which is off.  <answer145491> You can just setup a global keyboard shortcut for it in System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Mission Control  Or if you definitely want it from the command line, an applescript to do this (assuming you setup the keyboard shortcut to use kbdcmd/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdopt/kbdkbdctrl/kbdkbdD/kbd.  Note that you still MUST setup a keyboard command in System Preferences for this to work.  Put the below script into a file, say, ~/dnd.applescript  precodeignoring application responses     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "D" using {command down, shift down, option down, control down} end ignoring /code/pre  Now you can run codeosascript ~/dnd.applescript/code from the command line to toggle your DND setting.  Screencap:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhOkn.png" alt="Keyboard shortcut modification in System Preferences"  <answer186746> As of OS X 10.10.3, this AppleScript will toggle "Do Not Disturb." No keyboard shortcut required:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"   key down option   click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2   key up option end tell /code/pre  You can save it as an AppleScript and run it from the terminal with codeosascript DoNotDisturb.applescript/code, or you can include it in a Bash script by wrapping it in in a heredoc like so:  precode#!/bin/bash osascript &lt;&lt;EOD   tell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"     key down option     click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2     key up option   end tell EOD /code/pre  <answer217430> Building on James's answer, I'd also liek to point out that you can also determine if it is turned on or off. So the following turns it off, and does nothing if already off:  precodeif [[ $(plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.000-000-000-000.plist | grep false) ]]; then     osascript &lt;&lt;EOD       tell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"         key down option         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2         key up option       end tell EOD fi /code/pre  You must substitute your own machine GUID into the filename (there is only one file there, so it's easy to figure out)  <answer244130> Building on answers from James and Zsolt, I've created a couple of scripts to turn on or off (not toggle) DND state. They also don't require any key bindings or machine GUID to work.  But please note that running those scripts for the first time may require accessibility permission for the app which runs the scripts. If you will not grant the permission in the request â€” codealt/code button will remain pressed for the system and you will need to restart the computer to "unpress" it. This is also true for previous answers with AppleScript.  Turn Do Not Disturb strongON/strong (disable notifications):  precodeif [[ $(plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.*.plist | grep false) ]]; then     osascript &lt;&lt;EOD       tell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"         key down option         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2         key up option       end tell EOD fi /code/pre  Turn Do Not Disturb strongOFF/strong (enable notifications):  precodeif ! [[ $(plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.*.plist | grep false) ]]; then     osascript &lt;&lt;EOD       tell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"         key down option         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2         key up option       end tell EOD fi /code/pre  EDIT: macOS Sierra changes the menu bar from 2 to 1:  Turn Do Not Disturb strongON/strong (disable notifications):  precodeif [[ $(plutil -convert xml1 -o - ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.notificationcenterui.*.plist | grep false) ]]; then     osascript &lt;&lt;EOD       tell application "System Events" to tell process "SystemUIServer"         key down option         click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 1         key up option       end tell EOD fi /code/pre  Turn Do Not Disturb strongOFF/strong (enable notifications):  precodeif !

Or if I'm wrong, please correct me! <comment171470> Actually, never mind... I didn't realize that "betterTouchTool" requires the terminal for what you want. <comment171471> I primarily asked how to do it from the shell. Doing it from the system preferences solves my case, but it's more fun to know how to do it from shell. <comment171473> Gotcha, I updated my answer with the shell info. <comment188335> Perfect! Thanks. Wish there were a better way though. <comment188340> Better in what way? <comment188341> Not having to bind an obscure keyboard shortcut and toggle that with `osascript`. <comment188343> I guess I'm asking if you mean better as in "more effective" or better as in "prettier under the covers."  Is it a practical or aesthetic wish? <comment188344> Just curious, I don't have any additional suggestions either way. <comment188348> I just dislike when there are ambiguous entry points to an action, it works like a charm though! <comment220657> This means that you can also toggle `DoNotDisturb` by clicking the rightmost tiles in the menu bar while holding the `Option` key.
