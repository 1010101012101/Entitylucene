How would one rotate a PDF? <body> I have a scanned PDF document on an iPad 2 (iOS 6) that I need to rotate but cannot find any easy way to do this. How would I engage such an endeavor?  <answer64818> A lot of PDF viewers on the iPad allow rotation of PDF files. An example would be GoodReader which is a good app to have anyway if you need offline access to PDFs etc. To open a PDF in GoodReader e.g. from Mail use the "Open with..." button.  <answer106367> PDF Splicer is a very good app for that. It's free.  <answer283129> You can download an APPLE App Store called Bluebeam Revu. I believe you will have to pay for this. Once you port your PDF over to the app, you will need to select the square icon that has 4 boxes. Your PDF will appear to the left and will be a smaller version. You then can take 2 fingers an rotate your PDF to the position you want. Then you can select the icon at the top to email it back to yourself. I select "flaten and email". This works great and is very easy. I hope this helps.  <comment76153> Are you transferring the PDF from a computer? If so, it might be easier to rotate it on the computer first before transferring to your iPad. <comment76159> Which app are you using to view the PDF? <comment76162> @patrix i've been trying many. adobe reader, kindle, and the native app (i'm not really very good at mac, but i'm trying) <comment76171> You don't have to be good at using a Mac to use your iPad :-)
