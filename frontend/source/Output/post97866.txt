Mac stops responding temporarily <body> My iMac stops responding and if I click in any program the wait-wheel appears, most animations ( web pages animations,apps and others) stop, but after a few seconds it starts working again,... after a while this happens again.  I have OSX 10.8.4 and mid-2009 iMac. No visible sign of choking in Activity Monitor  How can I monitor which app or service is stopping mac from responding?  <comment114835> Bring up activity monitor and check the available liable memory,  depending on how much memory you have the machine might be busy swapping. <comment114836> No visible sign of choking in Activity Monitor. <comment114839> Please publish messages in the Console at the time of the event. <comment114877> Do all the apps stop responding, or just one? If it is all of them, this could be early symptoms of a failing hard drive. I'd say make sure you have a backup. Then run Repair Disk in Disk Utility.
