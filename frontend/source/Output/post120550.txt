Illustrator sometimes disable my second language in my Mac OS <body> I have a bilingual Mac OS (10.7.5) and sometimes when I use Adobe Illustrator CS5 English Version, the second language (Greek in my case) gets disabled.   It also switches to English if the other language is chosen before I switch (Command+Tab) into Illustrator.  This doesn't happen with Windows. What can I change on OS X or Adobe to prevent this switching?
