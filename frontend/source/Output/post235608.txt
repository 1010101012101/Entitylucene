Mysterious unidentified error message <body> I keep getting this error on my Mac (see attached screenshot).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cBU5M.png" alt="enter image description here"  It happened yesterday and now today again.  The dialog is not associated with any application (at least, when I select it, it does not change the menu bar). In expos√© the app title that it is given when mouse over is "UserNotificationCenter".  I can't find any info about this error on-line and I wondered if anyone had any ideas or any way to investigate it further.  Running 10.11.3.  <answer235609> I'm not sure, but it looks suspicious. Poorly written, use of exclamation mark, reference to "PC" - it all looks weird. It's pretty useless too - you get an "OK" button and nothing else? What sort of dialog is that?!  Maybe check your date/time settings, but if there's no problem, I'd be a bit concerned about malware. Did you install any software recently?
