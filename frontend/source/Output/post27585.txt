is there an app button for the voice control on an iPhone 4? <body> is there any way besides holding the home button to get to the voice control on the iPhone 4 like an app button or anything?  <answer27625> The (very) short answer is "No there isn't".   <answer27641> If you bring the phone up to your ear, Siri should activate. However, the only button for interacting with Siri is the home button.   <comment31822> Not to mention that iPhone 4 doesn't officially have Siri. <comment35222> A button in all apps or in one particular app?
