Start applications via remote control <body> I am searching for a way to start multiple, pre-defined applications via apple's remote control. Is this at all possible with Mavericks?  I have a special user account on my iMac that is used for watching films via Plex and DVB-T via EyeTv. While I can close all these applications via remote-control as soon as they are running, I have not found a way to start them.  Is there a third-party app that allows such a functionality? I already tried RemoteBuddy but it was much too complex for my needs.  <answer112287> BetterTouchTool supports remapping Apple's remote controllers and you can run a shell script (like codeopen -a Preview;open -a TextEdit/code) to open multiple applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaRco.png" alt=""  <comment131817> Please add to your original question a specific example of your need, so as to get practical answers. Typo: to complex → too complex ☺. <comment131842> My bad, sorry. I have added a more detailed usage example to the original post. <comment131843> An impressive tool, thanks. Unfortunately there seem to be some problems with other apps not receiving the input from the remote-control ([related](https://forums.plexapp.com/index.php/topic/30587-making-plex-and-bettertouchtool-work-together/)).
