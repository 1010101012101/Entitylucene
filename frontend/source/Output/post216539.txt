How do you remedy iMac (2009) slow start-up, and sluggish performance? <body> here are my system details:  OS X El Capitan - gold  iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009) 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 12 GB 1067 MHz DDR3  I have reduced startup to 1 or 2 apps, have at least 75GB avail on 500GB hard drive. A few months back I upped RAM from 4gb to 12gb. I don't do anything super-intensive on the machine. With 12GB this baby should be humming along fine. Any suggestions? Thanks.  <comment261703> Ram is not not so useful for start-up, but for real-time applications instead. It may depends to something else. Did you try installing an SSD? <comment262315> I have not tried that.
