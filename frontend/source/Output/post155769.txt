Fullscreen Flash video only shows 1/4 of video <body> When I maximize some Flash (version 15.0.0.xxx) videos to fullscreen, only the top left quarter of the screen is showing video, the rest is completely black.  I've tried this on OSX 10.9 and 10.10, 2014 Macbook Pro, 3 browsers (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox) with no plugins, no additional screen, and hardware acceleration set to enabled and disabled.  Here's a workaround I've found: right click on the 1/4-screen video and look for the codeStretching is &lt;type&gt;/code item in the options list. Click on that and the video will fill the screen. Keep repeating to get back to the 'Stretching is none' setting.  What can I do to debug this?  <answer164053> I've found it. After looking a little further, I was able to find something I missed some time ago.     ol   liIn the URL bar enter chrome://plugins//li   liLocate the Flash plug-in, you should see multiple versions listed/li   liClick Disable for the plug-in with the location /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so/li   liYou should still have one enabled in another location, like /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so/li   liRestart Chrome (quit and open again)/li   /ol   strongSource:/strong https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=135353#c25  This fixed it for me!  <comment192217> I am having the same exact problem, and I don't even have that Stretching item in options list. Gonna put a bounty on this, as this is something that annoys me as hell. <comment344020> Since Chrome 57, the chorme://plugins page has been removed.
