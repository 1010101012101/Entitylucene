Dragging a window to a space doesn't work the first time <body> In Mountain Lion (at least, maybe elsewhere too):  ol liEnter Mission Control to see all windows, and all spaces./li liDrag a window or a stack of windows to a space/li /ol  For me, the first attempt at this fails reliably; the space doesn't get darkened focus appearance, window springs back to original location on mouseup:   The second attempt succeeds reliably; space darkens, window moves on mouseup:   Happens with all applications, on a very fresh install of Mountain Lion, with no UI hack utilities installed, etc. Very annoying at start of workday when trying to place apps in spaces. Is this a bug or some sort of feature I am not aware of?  strongUpdate/strong: After upgrade to 10.8.2, this problem is resolved.  <answer65383> Confirmed: the mountain lion 10.8.2 update resolves this problem.  <comment75545> That’s strange… I don’t have this problem on my two computers. <comment75574> You get the focus behavior 100% of the time, when moving windows? Thanks. <comment75633> Yep, I do. There was no problem in either Lion or Mountain Lion. <comment76734> I could also reproduce the bug in 10.8.1, but it was fixed by the 10.8.2 upgrade. Can you post it as an answer so this question won't get bumped up later? <comment110256> Broken again in 10.8.4 - at least for me. <comment110416> Be sure you're not trying to move a window to the space it's already in, or trying to move a window like iTunes, which is not a normal window, but which lives on all spaces by default. 10.8.4 seems to be working OK for me.
