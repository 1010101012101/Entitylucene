Display PDF version metadata of a PDF file <body> I am looking for a way to display a PDF file version metadata without having to open the file AcrobatPro. Example: PDF Version 1.4 : I can easily do this on PC: right click on file, properties, select PDF tab, and it is displayed along with what application and pdf library produced it. On Mac, none of this shows in "Get Info" (command + I) nor using terminal and the mdls command. Any ideals on some commands and I could write a droplet script?  <answer206082> Phil Harvey's exiftool could be wrapped in a AppleScript droplet. As an example of the command:  precodeexiftool -S -pdfversion FILE /code/pre  <comment248447> Isn't this info available in the "More Info" dropdown, second from top? What are you missing? <comment248493> "On Mac, none of this shows in "Get Info" (command + I) nor using terminal and the mdls command." For PDF files the dropdown "More Info:" is null "--" <comment248494> Strange... Some of this information shows in my info, the file creator <comment248499> ExifTool by Phil Harvey is what I'm going with. It's not a simple Simon solution for others that are looking for one, but this tool gets all the metadata about the PDF file. I am in the printing biz and this data helps resolve rip problems.
