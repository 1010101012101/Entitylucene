Monitor to restart application whenever it freezes or exits <body> I want to have a certain GUI-based application always running.  It goes spinning-beachball a lot.  How do I make sure it is always running, restarting it whenever it freezes or exits?  <comment348639> Perhaps figuring out why the app beachballs so frequently would be a first step. <comment348648> it's just an old crappy application I have to run for work.  killing and restarting it would be just fine.
