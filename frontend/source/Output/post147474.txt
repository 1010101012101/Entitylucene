Clash of clans. Can I use my wife's Game Center account on my phone to start a new village? <body> Am I able to log in under my wife's games center account on my phone, without loosing my current village under my Game Center account? When I logged in under her Game Center account and began to open clash of clans, it said the current village would be deleted... So I cancelled. Thanks  <answer147578> At the moment, you can only start a new game on any new device where the game has never been played on previously.  Source: Supercell Game Support
