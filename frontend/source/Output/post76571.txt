Wifi Diagnostics get WiFi performance <body> Is there any way to get the wifi performance using the Wifi Diagnostics?  I have a 802.11n network running on Apple TimeMachine.  The Wifi Diagnostics created diagnostics report but I don't know which log file would have this information?  Can someone point me to the right file?  <answer76575> When the Wi-Fi diagnostics tool finishes, the logs get saved to your desktop.  If that didn't happen or was deleted, you will have to find them from a backup or re-run the tool.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9VFw1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Depending on what performance you are monitoring, I would start with the two files to get a summary of the signal and noise of your Wi-Fi recording session:   ul listronglink-events.log/strong:/li listronglink-info.log/strong:/li /ul  <comment88815> I have the logs but which log file would have the performance numbers? <comment88825> I found this http://www.macworld.com/article/1140684/check_wifi_speeds.html which states that older Airport Utility had a Logs/Statistics option. Was this moved to some other application?
