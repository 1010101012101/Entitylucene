Upgrade to El Capitan? <body> I'm on Yosemite at the moment I want to upgrade but I fear it will break my applications. I have a MacBook Pro (Late 2011) 15''. The last time I updated my Logic Pro 8 broke and I was forced to pay $200 for Logic Pro X (it is my theory that Apple did that on purpose) but either way, what is your suggestion on the Operating System nonsense?  <answer226425> I haven’t heard of any apps that work in 10.10 and don’t work in 10.11. Certainly not mainstream apps. Roaringapps.com shows no applications with a “doesn’t work” for 10.11  <comment274938> My suggestion would be that **you** look at the versions of software you have and then check with their manufacture if there are compatibility issues with OS X 10.11 and upgrade accordingly. <comment274939> I think that people are way too cautious over updating. My Mid-2009 MacBook Pro runs just as well, if not better on El Capitan than on Yosemite. In fact, that's really what El Capitan is all about: performance, not new just new features. That said, I'm not sure about compatibility on every app that you have, but you can probably find that info on the developer's website. <comment274944> Too cautious? OP said he lost a $200 piece of software. Seems right to ask his question.
