Read epub book purchased from iTunes on Windows <body> I have purchased a book through iTunes, it is formatted as an epub. Is there anyway I can read it in a Windows PC?  <answer104547> Depends on whether it's protected by DRM or not. If it's not DRM protected, you can use free software like Calibre. You can also read the ePub books in Firefox using the EPUBReader extension and in Chrome using the MagicScroll eBook Reader extension.  To know if your eBook is DRM protected (fixed the description to correctly say "DRM" instead of "copyright"):     ol   liOpen iTunes./li   liSelect the target ebook./li   liChoose File./li   liChoose Get Info./li   liLook at the “Media Kind” field.   ul   liIf it says “book,” it is a web download./li   liIf it says “purchased book,” it’s a DRM free iBook purchase/download./li   liIf it says “protected book,” it has a DRM attached./li   /ul/li   /ol   <answer104568> To read ebooks on a PC, it's best buy them from one of the stores which provides a free ereader app for that platform, probably Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Googlebooks, or Sony.   There is no indication Apple will join that group (it took 3 years to extend iBooks from iOS to OS X), but there are some publishers, like O'Reilly, who sell unprotected books on the iBookstore, and these can be read on a PC with the apps described by M K.  <answer107628> You can open your epub files with any of these programs:  ul liEPUB Reader/li liAdobe Digital Editions Home (recommended)/li liOkular/li /ul  You can read which one is best for you.  <answer191105> In order to read Ibooks in your computer, you need to install the Adobe Digital Editions software (free). In ITunes, I right click on the book that I want to read then right click and paste it on my desktop. It will be paste with an epub extension. then I use the Adobe Digital Editions to open it. I have read a lot of books using this software with no problem.  <answer192135> On a Windows7 machine I right-clicked the ibook in the iTunes application window and COPIED it via the pop-up menu onto my Windows desktop (you could copy it into any folder of your choosing). I then changed the extension of the copied file, which is a .ibooks-file, to .epub (just simply renaming the extension of the file name). I then could open the renamed file with the Calibre E-book viewer as well as with Adobe Digital Editions. Give it a try!  <comment123012> just checked, it is protected book <comment123014> Then you need a platform on which Apple's iBooks app is present - either an iOS device (at present) or OS X 10.9 Mavericks (which is yet to be released). There is no other legal way of reading the book elsewhere. <comment123015> Can I use Calibre to view books https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2510403?start=15&tstart=0   "Use the connect/share button in Calibre to connect to iTunes which will allow you to:  " <comment123019> Only for books that do not have DRM on them. Calibre will not help for iBooks eBooks that have DRM. <comment349195> 2017 Update – It has been hard to find a definitive answer on the Apple Site to the following question.  Can I view DRM iBooks on my Windows PC using officially supported viewers?  It is frustrating that I buy all my DRM music and DRM Movies from iTunes but I cannot tell if I could buy DRM iBooks and view them on My PC.  Apple parses their official words carefully on their site to leave this subject ambiguous.
