Dock isn't responding to mouse movement in Yosemite when external mouse (Cyborg R.A.T. 5) is attached <body> For the past few days now, I've come across a peculiar error with my Dock. It won't respond to my mouse moving down to the bottom of the screen until I click it, and when it does, it won't change the active icon when I drag my mouse over it. Here's a video of what happens.  This is accompanied by a peculiar error in Mission Control where I can't click on windows to enter them until I drag them a little bit. Here's a video of that phenomenon.  hr  Update: I've found out that this happens when I attach my external mouse (a Cyborg R.A.T. 5) to the computer. I'll test other external mice and then maybe file a bug report with Apple.  <answer208707> Okay, so it turns out the thing I was doing wrong was having an external mouse attached to the Macbook. As soon as I detached the mouse (an old Cyborg R.A.T. 5), everything started working normally again.  But it's still weird that that happens.  <comment251696> Upon a further Google search, it looks like the Cyborg R.A.T. line in general has problems with Macbooks. I guess I won't be using it anymore. <comment251735> I've added 'Cyborg R.A.T. 5' to your title, as your research may prove useful to future Googlers.
