How can I copy Time Capsule backups to a remote location? <body> Time Machine backups are great, but the disk they are on is located at home and therefore vulnerable to being stolen, lost in fire, etc... Additionally the backups are on a NAS drive where I use one partition for Time Machine and another one for storing media files.  I'd like to backup the Time Machine backups and the media files to a remote location. I already have a remote linux server available and can set up WebDAV. I was thinking of using SyncMate (which is pretty horrible, but I already own a copy).  What would be the best solution to backup to a remote server?
