MacOS 10.6 firewall treats IPv4 and IPv6 packets differently <body> I'm develping a wireless MIDI controller.  When connecting to a Mac running Mac OS 10.6, everything works fine, so long as the controller attempts to connect to the Mac using IPv4.  When using IPv6, I see "Connection attempt to UDP fe80:0005::0221:e9ff:fee5:b004:5004 from fe80:0005::de71:44ff:fe39:cbfa:5" in the Mac's console log, apparently from socketfilterfw, and Wireshark logs an IPv6 error packet stating "Port unreachable".  Since autoconf ("Bonjour") appends both A(IPv4 hostname) and AAAA(IPv6) hostname records to its SRV response when my controller asks it for instances of the _apple-midi service, it seems reasonable to assume that I should be able to connect using either.  Is this behaviour - allowing incoming IPv4 UDP packets but disallowing IPv6 packets to exactly the same host and port - hardwired or configurable?  <comment134712> Can we presume that when you disable the firewall that everything works properly?
