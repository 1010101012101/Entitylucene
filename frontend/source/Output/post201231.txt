Black screen when logging out a user <body> I've seen people asking about black screens on login, but never one on logout.  I had several users logged in, and logged one out (using CMD+SHIFT+Q, if that matters).  After a second or two, the desktop disappears and I'm left at a black screen with a working mouse pointer.  No keyboard shortcuts seem to do anything. I SSH'd into the box and killed all codeloginwindow/code processes; no visible effect.  I can codeshutdown/code or codereboot/code, and those work, but otherwise the box is totally useless.  I unplugged and re-plugged an external monitor (HDTV over mini DisplayPort to HDMI connector) and while it was mirroring the desktop beforehand, it didn't come back on afterwards.  This has happened 4 or 5 times now.  The system is an iMac Late 2009, running 10.10.4, if that matters.
