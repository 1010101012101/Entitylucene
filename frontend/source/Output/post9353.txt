Which 13" MacBook Pro 2011 is right for me? <body> I'm completely new to Mac (OS X) and I want to buy a 13" Macbook Pro 2011. I'm not sure if the "2,7 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7" is worth the +300â‚¬. I want to order one of the two with a 128GB SSD for fast boots. I'm a developer (mainly web) so I need the book for programming and for the university later this year. I'm not going to install Windows or Linux on the machine. I need Mac OS X.  My questions:  ol liIs there any advantage of a SSD in the Mac as long I don't plan gaming? Or do they boot up fast from some kind of sleep mode? I need a Notebook which starts really quick and does not loose battery when off (sleep mode etc.)./li liIs the i7 much better than the i5? I mean the only difference between the two books is only CPU and HDD./li liIs 13" enough? I can't visit an Apple store since there aren't any in my region. My current notebook is a 15" one running Ubuntu and I think it shouldn't be much smaller. But the 15" Macbooks are too expensive for me and a 13" might be more portable. I'll connect the book to a larger screen @ home anyway./li liThanks./li /ol  <answer9354> I've ordered the cheapest 13" as my first mac. I already have a 80 GB SSD which I will put in it immediately when it arrives. strongAn SSD is beneficial to about everything you can do on your mac because the hard disk is usually the performance bottleneck./strong  Don't worry about the screen size and resolution if you'll hook it up to an external monitor anyway. I've played around with a 13" a lot this week and the screen size and resolution are fine for normal pc usage.  I would not pay extra for the upgraded CPU. strongRemember that the cheapest 13" has about the same cpu speed as the previous generation's 17" flagship!/strong (see benchmarks posted below)  So either way I would go with the cheapest version. If you are unable/unwilling to open up your mac yourself I would take the SSD option. You can always get a nice little external HD with 1TB disk space for not much money, if you run out of SSD space.

The 13" laptops are a lot more portable than the 15" ones, ideal for taking to uni!  <comment9905> I decided to take the cheapest 13". Going to buy it today or tomorrow. :) <comment10003> I did the same thing and got the cheapest as my first mac and upgraded the ram to 8Gb.  It's actually faster than my Windows 7 desktop with an overclocked quad core.
