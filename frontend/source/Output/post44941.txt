Use AppleScript to launch and manage Quicktime Player in the background <body> I have a Perl-based audio player that runs on OS X, and I need to update how the audio files are played.  I'd like to use AppleScript to control the QuickTime Player, because it will do what I need, but am running into a couple of problems.  First, I need the QuickTime player to launch in the background. The way my Applescript is working now, it's putting the player in the foreground, which then requires users to click back on my Perl app to keep going.  Second, I would like to have playing a new audio file reuse the existing QuickTime Player window, so that there's only one player going at any given time.  So if a song is playing, and they choose to play another song, it stops the currently playing song in the window and loads up a new one in the same window.  Here's a fairly representative sample of the AppleScript that I'm working with.  I'd love to know if there's a way to accomplish both of those goals.  precodeset unixFile to "/Users/minter/mp3/ThomasDolby-SheBlindedMeWithScience.mp3" set macFile to POSIX file unixFile set fileRef to (macFile as alias)  tell application "QuickTime Player"     open fileRef     play the front document end tell  delay 3  tell application "QuickTime Player"    stop the front document    close the front document end tell /code/pre  So when I run this AppleScript, it pops the QT player window up in front.  If I run the script again, it creates a new window.  Both of those are the problems I'm trying to solve.  Any help would be appreciated!  <answer44965> How about this: It's not exactly what you want, but achieves roughly the same thing.  I seem to remember pre-OS X you could activate an app and keep it from being frontmost, but that appears not to be possible these days (or I imagined it.)  precodeto replaceFrontQTPlayerWithFile(aFile)  tell application "QuickTime Player"     activate      try         set frontDoc to front document         close front document     on error err number errNum         if errNum is -1719 then             -- There is no open document         else if errNum is -10000 then             -- Front doc exists, but does not really...         else             log err         end if     end try      open aFile     play front document      -- Hide QTP     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "h" using command down     end tell  end tell end replaceFrontQTPlayerWithFile   on run     set unixFile to "/Users/diggory/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/Music/Underworld/Oblivion With Bells/01 Crocodile.m4a"     set macFile to POSIX file unixFile     set fileRef to (macFile as alias)     my replaceFrontQTPlayerWithFile(fileRef) end run /code/pre  <comment51478> Did it help at all? <comment52182> That seemed to do the trick in Script Editor, but not in the Perl Applescript module that I'm using (but that's my problem, not yours) - thanks for the insight. <comment52183> One other question - do you know how I would use that same setup to stop the currently playing song in the existing QuickTime player? <comment53024> tell application "QuickTime Player"  stop front document end tell
