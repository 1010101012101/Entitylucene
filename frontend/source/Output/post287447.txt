Shortcut to insert row in Excel <body> I see a reference showing the shortcut to be codeCtl-Shift-I/code : but it is not working on Excel for Mac 2015  https://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts/insert-rows  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OSq8N.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any working shortcut for this?  <answer287456> Try command-shift-i instead of control-shift-i.  Ctl key is usually used on a windows machine and many of the comparable commands on Macs use the command key.  <answer287462> Just tested command shift + and control shift + on excel 2016 on a mac - both add a row as long as the row is selected.  If the row is not selected then it will shift the cells down in that row.  For Excel 2011, then control i works to add a row if the row is selected, if only a cell is selected then it brings up the insert cell dialogue. In excel 2011 command i does italic.  For command-shift-i this does italic on the selected row - the version using control does not work (excel 2106).  That website has information that appears out of date.  <comment362941> I tried all sorts of combinations - that was one of the first ones. That one just turns to Italics <comment363018> `Command-Shift-+` does in fact work. That is not a combination mentioned in the docs. Thanks . <comment363029> I sent a message to that site - they still insist that ctrl i adds a row when all it does is toggle italic.... perhaps they should test it in excel and see...
