How can I enable search by filename in finder on Lion <body> Before switching to Lion (on Snow leopard) I used to open a directory (like my codeDownloads/code) and start searching using the search box at the top right of the finder window for a file and there was an option to restrict the search to "filenames" only.br The "filename" option does not show up by default for me, is there a way to bring it back?  <answer33746> You can add tokens like this by typing codename:/code before the search phrase or selecting emFilename contains/em from the suggestion list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eKYsy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment38572> `name:` does not work for me! but now I noticed that when I start typing a menu appear with an option that says `File name contains ...` if I click on that I get the desired effect. <comment38576> @Ali You have to type like `name:search phrase` and then press return. Apple really botched up the UI though. <comment38600> Yep, you need to press return and then you'll see it as shown it the picture.
