How to tell if iTunes in the mini player mode from applescript <body> Is there a way to tell if iTunes is in mini player mode from applescript?  Using Mac OS X 10.8.4 Mountain lion.   <answer101162> You can do something like that :   precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         if title of window 1 is "MiniPlayer" then             -- If mini player         else if title of window 1 is not "MiniPlayer" then             -- if big player          end if     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment119095> Works nicely, thanks <comment160656> This works the way expected if either the MiniPlayer or the main window are visible.  That is, if one or the other, but not both, are visible.  However, if both windows are visible, it always acts as though MiniPlayer is window 1.  Maybe it is, but it would be nice to know which window is active (has focus).
