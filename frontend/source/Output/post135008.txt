Capture audio only from VLC <body> I'm using SoundFlower but it's capturing all the audio of the system. I only want to capture the audio of VLC and it's not letting me choose the Output.  <comment160020> Not sure what you doing. Is it you have a video playing in VLC and you want to save the audio portion only. <comment160280> I would be recording audio/video but only from Vlc not all the system. <comment160294> How are you recording from VLC ? with screen recorder ? using SoundFlower that than also captures all other (unwonted) sounds ? <comment160352> I'm using camtwist for screen recording. And FMLE for streaming. Using sound flower captures all the system output sounds. <comment160358> Nevermind I'm stupid, I found the setting. It was on the bar on top Audio - Soundflower(2ch). Thanks.
