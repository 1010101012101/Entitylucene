How to prevent FaceTime calls notifications from exiting fullscreen apps on OS X <body> When I get a call through FaceTime, it switches away from a full screen app/video I'm using. I don't want to turn it off, because getting calls on the computer is useful, but I don't want it to automatically switch what I'm doing.  <comment249880> This is actually a really good question. In theory, if you define that the FaceTime app has a Banner or Alert type of notification, it should do the trick. Alerts (which require an action to be dismissed) would exit the full screen app, whereas Banners would only present them self and be dismissed if no action was performed. <comment249963> @dordio I will try that. Could you answer so I can upvote? <comment249965> I already tried it but it doesn't work. I said *in theory* because it as supposed to work like I described. Unfortunately it doesn't <comment249967> @dordio Oh I see. I really wish Apple would fix this, because it's actually extremely annoying...
