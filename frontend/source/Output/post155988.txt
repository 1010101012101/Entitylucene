With FileVault: Yosemite starts with default desktop background <body> Since enabling FileVault (I think only after I did that for my second hard drive), the desktop background keeps resetting to the default at every startup. It suffices to select another folder in System Preferences - Desktop to make it switch back to the one chosen by me, I don't have to actually set it explicitly again. Does anyone experience the same issue?  <answer155990> Ok, it just occurred to me that the answer is obvious: OS X cannot access my Wallpapers folder which is on the second drive, before I have entered the password for using the drive, which obviously happens after the desktop is rendered. Solution: Move the wallpaper to the boot drive.  <comment185479> I also experience the resetting of desktop background every time I restart and I only have internal storage. <comment185512> And by 'internal' you mean only one hard drive or multiple ones which all are inside the computer?
