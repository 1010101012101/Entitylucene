Iphone 6 email reverts to 1970 <body> I have an iPhone 6 on iOS 8.4.  My problem is that the emails keep getting set back to 1970 and are blank. This happens every single day and I have to wait hours for it too fully sync again.  I have tried reloading the phone, removing and re-adding the email, soft reset, hard reset.
