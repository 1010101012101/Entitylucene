Would "non supported" memory modules cause the Mac to restart frequently? <body> I've got a Mac Mini mid mid 2011 upgraded with 8GB memory using Kingston sticks, but after the upgrade the Mac now frequently blinks the screen black and then restarts itself.  This is not a strongrestart loop/strong issue where the Mac never starts up, in fact it does start up normally, however, while using the Mac the described issue happens 2 or 3 times at least during a 1 hour usage.  Before the upgrade with the Mac running the factory default 4GB memory sticks the issue has never happened. I've assured myself I had the correct memory specs before buying the Kingston sticks, but now I'm not sure if the issue is related with the fact the memory sticks are not officially supported by Apple.    <comment249914> Maybe the memory sticks are faulty. Do you have any other system you could try them on? <comment249935> No, not at moment, this mac has been turned into my main computer for a few months since I've sold my old mid 2011 iMac.
