MAMP PRO uninstalled but Terminal commands still exist. How to remove them as well? <body>    Source:   To "uninstall" MAMP, you only have to delete the MAMP directory and   everything returns to the original state   I uninstalled MAMP using the Uninstaller from Applications/MAMP PRO. I checked all checkboxes to restore everything. Surprisingly after that, typing codemysql -p/code or codephp -v/code still works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3g0m4.png" alt="enter image description here"  I saw that another codeMAMP/code directory exists in codeApplications/code. strongWhen I removed/strong (still stays in the Trash just in case) it I got:  precodeslick-mac:~ slick$ php -v -bash: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.2/bin/php: No such file or directory slick-mac:~ slick$ mysql -p -bash: /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql: No such file or directory /code/pre  and that almost does the trick but finally how to remove all those references. I would like to completely remove those commands (codephp/code, codemysql/code, etc.)  Am I missing some symlinks?  EDIT:  I've found this for codephp/code in code/usr/bin/code  precodeslick-mac:bin slick$ ls -alh | grep php -rwxr-xr-x     1 root   wheel    10M 18 Oct 09:47 php -rwxr-xr-x     1 root   wheel   3.2K  9 Sep 17:30 php-config -rwxr-xr-x     1 root   wheel   4.4K 23 Aug 11:22 phpize slick-mac:bin slick$ pwd /usr/bin /code/pre  should I remove those 3 items?  <answer215926> OK, I forgot about code.bash_profile/code  precodealias mysql='/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql -u root -p' export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.2/bin:$PATH /code/pre  <answer215927> Probably you added one or more bin directories (containing mysql and php) to your $PATH. Remove them.  The three php* files in /usr/bin belong to the default OS X system and are completely legit.
