Multiple .local hostname on one computer <body> Is possible setup multiple code.local/code hostname on one physical computer?  Background:  ul lihome network (behind the DSL/NAT router) (192.168.1.*)/li lihave a mac-mini, called as "tango.local". (set in the System.prefs). The IP-setting is "use DHCP with manual address" - the computer address is 192.168.1.10./li /ul  Now, on this mac want run codeapache2/code (macports version), with different codeVirtualHost/code directives, like:  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerName tango.local     ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/     ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5000 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerName another.local     ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/     ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  For this setup I need assign two different hostnames to the mac, e.g. the main codetango.local/code and the codeanother.local/code. Both names should be coderesolve-able/code from the LAN, e.g. computers on the LAN (my mac-notebook) must correctly resolve the codehttp://another.local//code address.  It is possible to do this with simple way, (e.g. somewhat convience the bonjour to advertise both names for the single IP), or need setup the codebind/code DNS server for serving the code.local/code domain?  Bonus question: the main goal is resolve the codeanother.local/code from another mac (via bonjour). Secondary: what i need setup to allow access the codehttp://another.local/code from an windows7 notebook? (i'm total windiot - e.g. is possible somewhat convert bonjour names-addresses to the "windows codenmbd/code" or whatever?  <answer170594> I think you don't need to register a new hostname if you're just about publishing web services. On the Mac, you can register a new website with bonjour on the command line with  precodedns-sd -R "My Website" _http._tcp . 80 path=/path-to-page.html /code/pre  you can verify that it worked by using Safari's bonjour menu or on the command line with   precodedns-sd -B _http._tcp /code/pre  Bonjour for Windows is available (and is, I think, included when installing iTunes).  If for some reason you actually emneed/em specific host names, you could consider using dnsmasq (can be installed with homebrew or macports) to reroute your specific hostnames only (using your default DNS for everything else) and telling your Windows computer to use your Mac as its DNS server.  hr  h2Update:/h2  I failed to realise it's totally possible, you can indeed register multiple .local hostnames with bonjour, do it as a proxy like this:  precodedns-sd -P myService1 _http._tcp local 80 server1.local 127.0.0.1 path=/path/to/service1 dns-sd -P myService2 _http._tcp local 80 server2.local 127.0.0.1 path=/path/to/service2 /code/pre  Here you're registering two services (myService1,-2) running on the same server (127.0.0.1, within different server paths) on port 80 as two different .local names.  <comment204355> Hey, I've updated my answer below after realising it's totally possible to register multiple `.local` names simply by using the dns-sd proxy option. <comment324935> Note that using "127.0.0.1" will make the hostname work like "localhost" on all local machines.  If you want to connect to the new hostname from another machine on the network, use its LAN IP address.
