Ipod touch 5 stuck on voice over when restarted <body> I recently reset my ipod touch 5 and left it for the next day. When I turned it on the next day it somehow got on voice over mode and I can't swipe the screen without it speaking. What do I do?   <answer282704> Click fast 3 times on the home button  <comment356268> And then perhaps disable it in Settings  General  Accessibility  VoiceOver
