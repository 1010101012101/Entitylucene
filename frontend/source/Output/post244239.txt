AppleScript : write text on menu bar <body> I wonder if AppleScript can print a variable in the top menu bar in OSX 10.11 ?  <comment300960> Can you provide some details? <comment300973> Maybe, but not that I know of. Access so far as I know is one way: using GUI scripting to interact with elements in the menu bar that already exist. I don't know about "writing" to the menu bar. There might be some hackey workarounds, but I'm not sure. <comment301024> Yes thank you, I guess I need to code a swift menu bar app, and then add my applescript in it <comment301042> @KevinCork I know with Xcode it's possible to display something up there, but I have no idea how to do that.
