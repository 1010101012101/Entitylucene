Is there an extension for macOS Photos for perspective correction? <body> I was wondering whether anyone knows of, or can recommend, an extension for Photos on macOS that allows correcting perspective?  <answer293484> The app “Perspective Photos Extension” would seem to be the answer to my question. But neither its screenshots nor its reviews convinced me it would be worth the purchase. I haven’t come across any similar app that provides a Photos extension. Instead, I decided to try “DxO Perspective” in combination with “External Editors For Photos”.  <comment370338> Which perspective control is needed? Lens correction, keystone or more advanced combinations like the SKRWT app does on iOS - http://moblivious.com/reviews/skrwt/ <comment370342> Keystone correction is what I had in mind. If you know of any macOS apps besides the two in my answer, I'd love to hear about them. <comment370343> I've always done this type of thing in Photoshop but +1 for doing the research & providing a good working/starter answer for Photos.
