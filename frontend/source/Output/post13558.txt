Jailbreak an officially unlocked iPhone <body> My iPhone 3GS was unlocked using O2's official method.  I am considering jailbreaking but am unsure if this will affect the unlock status of the handset.  The jailbreak options available seem a little bewildering, so is there a specific jailbreak method which doesn't unlock and will leave my iPhone with the official unlock?  What I really don't want to happen is to jailbreak and have the phone lock again on the next iOS update.  I am currently running iOS 4.3.3 and use iTunes on Windows 7 x64.  <answer13561> It won't affect the unlock.  A legitimate (ie sanctioned by the carrier and not hardware/software) unlock happens at the carrier level and jailbreaking doesn't affect that.  <answer13610> Follow this wizard: http://www.iclarified.com/jailbreak/iphone3gs/firmware.php  <comment14434> Is there a specific tool I need to use? I've been on the googles and found this quote: "NOTE: Those of you who rely on a carrier unlock MUST STAY AWAY from Redsn0w and stock iOS 4.3.3 firmware." (http://www.redmondpie.com/jailbreak-4.3.3-ios-iphone-4-3gs-ipad-ipod-touch-4g-3g-using-redsn0w-how-to-tutorial/) <comment14465> @Shevek that means people who are locked to a carrier and use jailbreak to *unlock their carrier lock*. In your case, you're not locked to a carrier. But I don't think the *official carrier unlock* is **only** at carrier level, though I agree jailbreak certainly will **not** affect your unlock. <comment14486> doesn't include 4.3.3 yet <comment14487> so I can safely use either Redsn0w or Sn0wbreeze then? <comment14488> although if I select 4.3.2 it ends up at a Redsn0w page about 4.3.3! <comment14489> ah, the IMPORTANT FOR UNLOCKERS section on this page explains it quite well: http://www.iclarified.com/entry/index.php?enid=14563&laid= <comment14743> Do you object to jailbreaking on 4.3.3 instead of 4.3.2?
