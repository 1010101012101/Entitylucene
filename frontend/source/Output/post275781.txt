I installed the Stamps.com Connect to my computer and I can't uninstall <body> I installed the Stamps.com Connect to my OS X Macbook. I cannot get rid of the stupid thing. I cancelled my subscription the day I created it but I cannot get the icon off of my menu bar not can I delete it from my applications. I have not been able to use the command key to drag the icon because that just opens it in the menu bar. In the applications file, it will not let me delete it because "it is in use." I am at my wits end. Please help. Thanks!  <answer275794> Make sure the application is closed by clicking on the menu bar icon and clicking "quit" (or something similar) and delete it from Applications.  You could also search "login items" in spotlight and turn off the app from auto launching if it's there and then try restarting your computer.  emThis has been said to be false but I would try/em: Also be sure you ejected the installer. You can find it in finder on the left, otherwise it may be on the desktop.  <answer275865> Your application is probably running in background, so you have to "kill it" before you can uninstall it.  Using Activity Monitor, find the emStamps.com Connect/em process and double click on it (using Acrobat as an example because I don't have Stamps.com; the process is the same, however).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQLWWm.png" alt="enter image description here"  You will then be presented with another dialog which will allow you to quit the running process:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JLXfzm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select "Quit."  You should then be able to uninstall the software.  As for uninstalling it, I recommend using AppCleaner.  I have used it for many years and it has been successful in removing even the most stubborn of Apps.  Plus, it's free.  <comment347051> Why am I getting downvotes? <comment347107> Didn't downvote, but the answer is basically incorrect.  The installer will have nothing to do with the running app.  Your advice to quit is on the right track, but a bit vague on how to accomplish
