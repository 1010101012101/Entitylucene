Trouble with photo syncing between iPhone and iPad <body> Sometimes when I take photos in my iPhone 5s they automatically show up on my iPad. But most of the time they don't.  How can I analyze and solve this?  <answer205236> Two options:  Using iCloud: - On your iPhone go to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup - Turn iCloud Backup on and wait for it to back up completely - If you've already used your iPad, on there go to Settings  General  Reset, tap Erase All Content and Settings - When you're setting up the iPad, it will ask if you want to restore from an iCloud backup—just choose the iPhone backup  Using a computer with iTunes: - Sync your iPhone with iTunes—this will also make a backup - If you've already used your iPad, on there go to Settings  General  Reset, tap Erase All Content and Settings - Connect your iPad to your computer and follow the steps in iTunes to restore from the iPhone backup  Follow this guide with steps and demo if you need it: How to Transfer Photos from iPhone to iPad  <comment210935> You had two questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. I've edited out your second question, but feel free to ask it separately. <comment247498> How does a full restore address the issue stated in the question?
