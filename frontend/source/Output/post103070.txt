More colors than ls -G in file extensions <body> In the output of codels -G/code, I can see some extensions get colors like symbolic links or .sh files. What if I also want .jpg, .xml, .wav or .log to have different colors too?  Also, is there any way I can set the color extensions list and set separate colors for different extensions?  <answer103094> The colors used by codels -G/code are based on the file attributes (like directory, symbolic link, executable and so on). See codeman ls/code and go to the section on the codeLSCOLORS/code environment variable for the list of color values and the order of file attributes to define the colors for each file attribute.  You cannot change the colors by file extension by default. But one way to achieve this is by installing other software, like codecoreutils/code, from brew or MacPorts.  Also see this detailed answer on superuser - colouring output of ls according to file extension.
