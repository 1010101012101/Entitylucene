How to install Tesserocr on Mac <body> I'm trying to install Tesserocr for python  I'm not sure what the replacement for codeapt-get/code in codeapt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev/code is in this case. I'm new to this and don't fully understand how it works.  I installed codetesseract/code successfully, but I think (to my understanding) codetesseract/code is a command line program. I check codebrew/code but I don't think codebrew/code has it.  <answer288075> To install tesserocr's dependencies on macOS, you can use a package manager like Homebrew or macports. These install the C/C++ libraries and executables that are needed.   For either of them you need to install the base package manager the install tesseract   For Homebrew codebrew install tesseract/code  For Macports codesudo port install teseract/code  After that you will be able to install you strongtesserocr/strong wrapper using codepip install/code without errors:  precodepip install tesserocr /code/pre  <comment363692> [Do I need to install pip?](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) & `pip install tesserocr` and maybe one of virtualenv or pyenv <comment363693> I mean thats fine, but I think the issue here is that I don't see a way to install the requirement packages <comment363873> it work! Just so I can understand how it works next time, `brew install tesseract` installs the requirement packages and `pip install tesserocr` installs the ocr right?
