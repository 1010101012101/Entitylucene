Create a recently added playlist? <body> Is it possible to have a "Recently Added" as a Playlist on iTunes ? For example, I would like the recent 20-50 songs to be automatically added and renewed in that playlist.  <answer112568> Normally there is a default smart playlist with recently added items. If there is no such playlist you can easily recreate one with the following steps:  ul liCreata a new smart playlist kbdShift/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdn/kbd/li liname it “recently added“/li liselect match all rules/li liselect date added is in the last 2 weeks/li liselect media kind is not podcast/li lilimit the result to 50 items/li /ul  This should be it. Of course you can adjust the playlist to your likings (e.g. not last 2 weeks but last two month).  <comment132187> There should already be such a playlist defined by default (unless you deleted it) <comment132188> @patrix Might have deleted it because I don't have it. <comment132189> Worked perfectly, thanks <comment132191> Also make sure that “live updating” is checked.
