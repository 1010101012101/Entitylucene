How do I search Mail.app by country code? <body> I want to look at just the emails sent to me from the code.ru/code (or any other domain code), and I'm not having ay luck. Searching codefrom:.ru/code orcodefrom:".ru"/code doesn't work. A wildcard approach doesn't work either. Anybody out there know the trick?  <answer91901> Just type code.ru/code in the search box, hit enter, then click the strongAny/strong drop down that appears and change it to strongFrom/strong.  <answer91920> You can make a smart mailbox where "From" "ends with" "ru".  <comment107938> But that also captures, to make up an example, `dan.rush@email.com`.
