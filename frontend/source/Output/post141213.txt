Grab the "Active" Window in Applescript <body> I have a script which perform the following:  ol liLoad a file into a program (Subler â€” done separately, not in this script)/li liConfirm the loading of the file (this is where the script begins)/li liSaves the file/li liIn the save location window it selects a specific directory to save the file in/li liPresses "return"/li /ol  I would like to know how to perform step 4 with the active (or last used) window instead of a specific window title.  This is the relevant code:  precodeget every action of list 1 of scroll area 1 of scroll area 1 of browser 1 of splitter group 1 of group 2 of sheet 1 of window "untitled" /code/pre  This is the entire code:  precodeon run       tell application "Subler" to activate     delay 1      tell application "System Events"         delay 0.5         keystroke return         delay 1         keystroke "s" using command down     end tell      activate application "Subler"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "Subler"             get every action of list 1 of scroll area 1 of scroll area 1 of browser 1 of splitter group 1 of group 2 of sheet 1 of window "untitled"         end tell      end tell      tell application "Subler" to activate     delay 1      tell application "System Events"     end tell      return input end run /code/pre  <answer141438> It's been a while since I played with Applescript, but I think it's just 'window 1' [without quotes] for the frontmost window.
