Is it possible to load non-default launchd plist files from the /etc configuration file? <body> I created the /etc/launchd.conf file but at start the content is never read.  The content of launchd.conf is: load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/KillVuze.plist  (I run on OSX 10.7.2 )  If I load the plist by command line the "launchd list" show my plist as registered, but not after reboot even if I proper set the /etc/launchd.conf  Is this loading of non-default plist files (those stored outside the normal locations) best accomplished in this manner?  <answer52382> To load a launchd job at start up, you need to store your job description plist file in one of two folders:  ul licode/Library/LaunchAgents/code/li licode/Library/LaunchDaemons/code/li /ul  Do not edit or store launchd job description files in the code/System/code folder. This folder is reserved for exclusive use by Apple.  You do not need to edit any configuration files.  <comment59912> Is there some reason you need to save the plist in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/`? Ones in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` and `/Library/LaunchAgents/` should get loaded automatically.
