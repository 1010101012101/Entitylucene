How do you change the behavior of the power button in Lion? <body> On my Macbook Pro, whenever you press the power button it goes into sleep mode. How do I change this to do nothing?   <answer47146> You can control whether pressing the power button should put your mac to sleep or present a dialog with options (sleep/restart/shut-down) using the codepmset/code command. The following:  precodesudo pmset powerbutton 1 /code/pre  will put it to sleep right away (presumably your current setting) and changing code1/code to code0/code will present you with the dialog.   Pay attention to the fact that it's not a per-user setting, and changes the behaviour for all users. Something to keep in mind if you share the device with others. From the man page (explore it for other options):     All changes made through pmset are saved in a persistent preferences file (per-system, not per-user) at        /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist   <answer151632> precodedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool no /code/pre  Is working for me on 10.9.5, and gives behavior very close to how the power button used to work for me on 10.6. Though there is a bit more of a delay, it's definitely not infuriating anymore.  http://www.defaults-write.com/10-9-stop-the-power-button-from-putting-your-mac-in-stand-by-mode/  <comment125722> Seems this does not work for Mavericks. It gives "Usage: pmset options" output. Any thoughts? <comment129996> I can confirm, `pmset` in Mavericks doesn't accept powerbutton arguments. <comment133301> So irritating that someone clear used time to remove functionality that everybody is crying for now! <comment318478> Not working for me in Sierra / macOS 10.12; nothing happens when I pressing the power button.    OTOH, I can hit Ctrl-PowerButton to get a dialog, whether this is set to yes, no or unset.
