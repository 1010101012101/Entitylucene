Why is syslog not logging where I tell it to log? <body> I've configured syslogd like so:  precode*.debug /var/log/messages /code/pre  I want pretty much everything logged in code/var/log/messages/code.   When I run  precodesyslog -s hello /code/pre  I get the message showing up in code/var/log/message/code.  I tried restarting syslog using  precodelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist ps -x | grep [s]yslog /code/pre  to check that syslog is not running, then  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.syslogd.plist /code/pre  to restart.  I checked code/etc/syslog.conf/code to make sure it doesn't change, and it doesn't. Still I get messages logged to code/var/log/message/code.  Is there another place to set this?  <answer13895> I can confirm the following worked on my Mac running 10.6.7:  I added the following line to /etc/syslog.conf (where code&lt;tab&gt;/code is a tab character):  precode*.debug&lt;tab&gt;/var/log/messages /code/pre  I HUP'd the syslogd process using codesudo kill -HUP &lt;syslogd pid&gt;/code.  And tested it with codelogger -p debug test_msg/code and codesyslog -s hello/code.  syslog created /var/log/messages on the fly as I used the logger and syslog commands.  The man page for syslog.conf(5) specifies the use of tabs between the fields.  However, I tried using a single space instead and that worked as well.  Based on the man pages for syslog and syslogd, /etc/syslog.conf appears to be the only configuration file you need to worry about.  <answer13959> Thanks. After using codevi/code to create the file instead of a python script, I noticed that it was logging as expected. I did a codediff/code of the files and noticed one had a newline while the other did not. Apple must remove the last character of the file expecting it to be a newline, which is why without the newline it logged to code/var/log/message/code instead of code/var/log/messages/code. I have fixed the python script. Your note about the tab made me try the codediff/code on the file, so thanks!  <comment14822> [`/etc/asl.conf`](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/asl.conf.5.html) is also used to configure *syslogd*, but the storage files it specifies are not normal “plain text” log files. Do you perhaps have an embedded NUL character before the last `s` in your `syslog.conf` line? I can’t really imagine how it would happen “naturally”, but I was able to reproduce something similar with the line `*.* /tmp/message00s` (where the `00` is actually a single NUL character instead of the literal four displayed). <comment14902> Thanks, I was unaware of `asl.conf`. The actual problem was a newline, so you were close. <comment14966> @user6385 Good diagnosis. Yes, now that you point it out, it was easy to spot the no-final-newline bug in `get_line_from_file` in [syslogd.tproj/daemon.c](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/syslog/syslog-100.2/syslogd.tproj/daemon.c). <comment259826> This isn't an answer, it's an attempt to comment on a previous answer.

It does add some thinking and I'd have given the solved check mark to che2cbs, but I'm glad that the solved check mark lets anyone know that the OP is happy with the knowledge they have.
