How do I install sudo insults on Mac? <body> How do I install sudo insultssupem†/em/sup on Mac terminal?  Apparently Apple has cleaned it up from Darwin, so adding codeDefaults insults/code through codesudo visudo/code does not help.  hr  emsupsup†/sup The insulting things sudo command says when you enter wrong password./em/sup  <answer257430> To install a sudo emwith insults/em you have to compile it yourself:  Requirements: Xcode 8.0, Sierra 10.12, probably SIP disabled  ul liBackup sudo and visudo:  precodesudo cp /usr/bin/sudo  /usr/bin/sudo.backup sudo cp /usr/sbin/visudo  /usr/sbin/visudo.backup /code/pre/li liCreate a dir: codemkdir sudo/code/li liChange to the directory: codecd sudo/code/li liCurl the Apple open source sudo:  precodecurl https://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/sudo/sudo-83.tar.gz | tar zxf - /code/pre/li licd to the source folder:  precodecd sudo-83/src /code/pre/li liconfigure, make and make install it:  precode./configure --with-password-timeout=0 --disable-setreuid --with-env-editor --with-pam --with-libraries=bsm --with-noexec=no --sysconfdir="/private/etc" --with-timedir="/var/db/sudo" --with-all-insults make sudo make install /code/pre  The file sudo-83/src/INSTALL contains a lot more tweak options for the configure command!/li liThe files may be installed to /usr/local/bin/ and /usr/local/sbin/ so you may have to move them (in my case I had to):  precodesudo mv /usr/local/sbin/visudo /usr/sbin/visudo sudo rm /usr/local/bin/sudoedit sudo mv /usr/local/bin/sudoreplay /usr/bin/ sudo mv /usr/local/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudo ln -s /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudoedit /code/pre  strongor/strong modify your path and prepend /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin./li liEnter code/usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/visudo/code/li liAdd the line in eminsert mode/em (simply hit kbdi/kbd)  precodeDefaults        lecture_file = "/etc/sudo_lecture" #&lt;-already there Defaults        insults /code/pre  Save the file after hitting kbdesc/kbd with code:wq!/code./li liProbably you have to quit and relaunch Terminal now./li /ul  Results:  precodehost:~ user$ ls -l /usr/bin/sudo* -rwsr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  restricted 225428 Oct 19 02:01 /usr/bin/sudo -r-x--x--x  1 root  wheel  restricted 369136 Oct 19 02:00 /usr/bin/sudo.backup lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  restricted     13 Oct 19 02:03 /usr/bin/sudoedit -&gt; /usr/bin/sudo -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  restricted  49544 Oct 19 02:01 /usr/bin/sudoreplay host:~ user$ sudo openssl sha1 /usr/bin/sudo* SHA1(/usr/bin/sudo)= 87d9ad990813b5a949d07267d566bb3a1fddeec0 SHA1(/usr/bin/sudo.backup)= 088c317bf7b8a146803533173699021b9aef5b16 SHA1(/usr/bin/sudoedit)= 87d9ad990813b5a949d07267d566bb3a1fddeec0 SHA1(/usr/bin/sudoreplay)= f76c5ad8d6f2aebbc24d77fee54a54ba9d207e25  Last login: Wed Oct 19 02:09:33 on console host:~ user$ sudo ifconfig Password: Do you think like you type?

You can also add additional ins_*.h files but then you have to include them in insults.h like the other four already are. You may also include non-english insults of course!  <comment322021> I really wanted that your answer worked. It doesn't. I still get the same `Sorry, try again.` message. <comment322023> @displayName I tested the how-to in a virtual machine and it worked. The two sudo files differ notably by size: the original has about 370 KB, the modded (with insults) is much smaller: ~235 KB. Please check this. I may re-run the compilation and check the precise size and/or upload it somewhere
