Is there a way to search for ISBNs in the macOS Terminal? <body> I know this might be an odd question, but I'm always trying to find a way to look up ISBNs without looking for them at Amazon. I hate that site. I want to type in a book's name and have an output of books along with their ISBNs in the Terminal so then I can export them to CSV. Is there a way to do this? I'm guessing not, but it never hurts to ask.  <comment325224> Related: [What is the most comprehensive resource for querying french and english books having an ISBN code?](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/95/what-is-the-most-comprehensive-resource-for-querying-french-and-english-books-ha) - [Google](https://www.google.de/search?q=isbn+search+command+line)
