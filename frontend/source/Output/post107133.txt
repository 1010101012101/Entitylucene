Mail Quits on Mavericks <body> Mail program on my Mac Pro (early 2009) doesn't want to start, or rather just was quitting after I tried to start it multiple times.  I deleted it and tried to re-install old mail program from Snow Leopard disk, now I don't have mail at all. Can anyone help me to deal with the problem?  Important: I installed Mavericks two days before it happened.  <answer107459> If you still have the old backup of the Mail database prior to the 10.9, you can replace the mail folder in code~/Library//code by the old version, and restart the Mail in your Mavericks. The new Mail will convert it to the new version of the database structure.   I met the same issue a couple of days before, fortunately, I have the Time Machine backup, thus resolved by this way.
