How can I reset the dock? <body> I recently updated my computer from Mavericks to El Capitan, and I'm unable to add or remove items from the dock. If I attempt to change the dock, the computer freezes and I am unable to interact with the computer through the GUI.  The machine has multiple users, and I am the only user on this system that has this problem. I suspect that it's an issue with the way my dock is configured. Is there any way to "factory-reset" the dock? Failing that, is there any way to fix a dock that can't be modified?  <answer243580> Using the terminal, you can try deleting your dock preferences, then restarting the dock:  precode% defaults delete com.apple.dock % killall Dock /code/pre  This won't affect the contents of your dock, but it will reset the preferences that you'd normally edit in the Dock panel of the System Preferences.  EDIT: Per comments below, apparently this does reset dock contents for some people, but not for others&mdash;not clear why.  <comment300008> You said, "_This won't affect the contents of your dock_" and this is not true!  Deleting the com.apple.dock.plist file and restarting the Dock does a full reset while not only loosing the arranged order of apps it also removes all apps that have been added. Your answer is destructive while claiming it's not! <comment300009> @user3439894: It's didn't remove all apps for me when I did it. It didn't change the contents of `~/Library/Prefrences/com.apple.dock.plist` for example. <comment300010> But it did fix the problem of the dock causing the computer to freeze! <comment300011> @Dan, It totally reset my Dock as if the User Account was just freshly created and logged in for the first time. <comment300017> @user3439894: Ah. Well, at least it's only a little bit destructive. <comment300046> Apologies to anyone who lost their dock contents then. It didn't affect mine when I tried it out first (having already read elsewhere that it shouldn't), but apparently that must vary from case to case for some reason.
