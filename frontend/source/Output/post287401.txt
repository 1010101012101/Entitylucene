Help with AppleScript moving email messages <body> I have written the script below to move messages from one mailbox to another in Mail.  But when I run it, just a few email messages are moved at a time. E.g. if I have 10 messages in the mailbox, only three or four are moved. So I have to run the script multiple times to complete the operation! As far as I can tell it's pretty random how many move each time.  So does anyone know why this might be, and how I could improve this script?  Many thanks!  precodeuse AppleScript version "2.4" -- Yosemite (10.10) or later use scripting additions  tell application "Mail"      set theWorkInbox to mailbox "Work Inbox" of account "Work"     repeat with currentWorkMessage in every message of (mailbox "Work Holding Bay" of account "Work")         set mailbox of currentWorkMessage to theWorkInbox     end repeat  end tell /code/pre  I'm using macOS Sierra  <answer287413> It's better if you capture a reference to every message in a variable, instead of getting the reference every time you loop.  precodetell application "Mail"     set theWorkInbox to mailbox "Work Inbox" of account "Work"     set TargetInbox to mailbox "Work Holding Bay" of account "Work"      -- CAPTURE REFERENCE TO EVERY MESSAGE OF MAILBOX IN A VARIABLE     set EveryMessage to every message of TargetInbox      repeat with currentWorkMessage in EveryMessage         set mailbox of currentWorkMessage to theWorkInbox     end repeat  end tell /code/pre  <comment362890> Thanks I have updated to your version, and it now seems to work perfectly. <comment363677> You're welcome!
