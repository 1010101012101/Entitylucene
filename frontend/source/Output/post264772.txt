Qt Creator and iTerm2 <body> Qt Creator opens the UGLY Terminal app for running/debugging programs. Using this script:  precode#! /bin/bash  # ugly escaping: for apple script \ and " need to be escaped, whereas %q takes care of all bash escaping declare -a args mydir=`pwd` mydir=$(printf '%q' "$mydir") mydir="${mydir//\\/\\\\}" args[0]="cd ${mydir//\"/\\\"};" for a in "$@" ; do     x=$(printf '%q ' "$a")     x="${x//\\/\\\\}"     args[${#args[@]}]="${x//\"/\\\"}" done mArgs=${args[@]:0}  osascript &lt;&lt;EOF     --Terminal opens a window by default when it is not running, so check     on applicationIsRunning(applicationName)             tell application "System Events" to count (every process whose name is applicationName)             return result is greater than 0     end applicationIsRunning     set terminalWasRunning to applicationIsRunning("Terminal")      set cdScript to "$mArgs"     tell application "Terminal"         --do script will open a new window if none given, but terminal already opens one if not running         if terminalWasRunning then             do script cdScript         else             do script cdScript in first window         end if         set currentTab to the result         set currentWindow to first window whose tabs contains currentTab         activate     end tell EOF /code/pre  How can I force it to use iTerm2 instead of Terminal..?  <answer287649> The script you posted is a pretty good base for some edits. The second part is AppleScript, and iTerm2 offers a nice interface with it.  First, create a script (let's say code~/newiTerm.sh/code) and put the following content  precode#! /bin/bash  # ugly escaping: for apple script \ and " need to be escaped, whereas %q takes care of all bash escaping declare -a args mydir=`pwd` mydir=$(printf '%q' "$mydir") mydir="${mydir//\\/\\\\}" args[0]="cd ${mydir//\"/\\\"};" for a in "$@" ; do     x=$(printf '%q ' "$a")     x="${x//\\/\\\\}"     args[${#args[@]}]="${x//\"/\\\"}" done mArgs=${args[@]:0}  osascript &lt;&lt;EOF set cdScript to "$mArgs" tell application "iTerm2"     set newWindow to (create window with default profile)     tell newWindow         select         set _session to current session         tell _session             write text cdScript         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  Then, go to strongQt Preferences/strong ( codeâŒ˜,/code )  strongEnvironment/strong  strongSystem/strong  strongTerminal/strong and set the value to code~/newiTerm.sh/code  Works well for me.  Cheers
