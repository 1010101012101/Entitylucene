How can I activate buttons with just the keyboard? <body> Many user interface (UI) elements or dialog boxes have buttons. I would like to be able to activate a button with just the keyboard, without the mouse. How can I do this?  <answer7264> For many dialog boxes you can select the option you want by pressing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdfirstletter/kbd where kbdfirstletter/kbd is the first letter of the option you want to select  <answer7269> h3Enable Keyboard Control of the UI/h3  precodeSystem Prefs &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts /code/pre  Then select "All Controls" radio button at the bottom, rather than just "Text boxes and lists only".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MYNPd.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Keyboard Shortcuts/h3  ul likbd&#x21E5;/kbd (TAB) will move between buttons./li likbdesc/kbd (ESC) is strongcancel/strong./li likbdspace/kbd (SPACE) selects the strongactive/strong button (blue, outline)./li likbd&#x21A9;/kbd (RETURN) is strongOK/strong or the strongdefault/strong button (blue, pulsing, filled)./li liFor some dialog boxes, kbd⌘/kbd+kbdfirst_letter/kbd will select the button with a certain first letter in the text (as pointed out by @Griffo)./li /ul  <answer7270> Tab to move to the next dialog box.

Hitting kbd&#x21E5;/kbd will cycle between options, with a blue outline around the other button, but the default will remain blue.  Hitting kbd&#x21A9;/kbd will always select the default, kbdspace/kbd will select whichever button is highlighted.   In this example, pressing kbd&#x21A9;/kbd will 'Keep .txt' and pressing kbdspace/kbd will 'Use .bak.'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/681yW.png" alt="Dialogue Box"  <answer9473> kbd⌘/kbd+kbd./kbd also works for emCancel/em. And in some applications just pressing the initial letters works. Photoshop is one, but it's pretty common for other cross-platform applications too.  Typing kbd⌘/kbd+kbdW/kbd+kbdD/kbd is a quick way to do something like emClose and don't save/em.  <comment7771> Cooool!!! +1!  I had no idea. <comment8021> Thanks @Am1rr3zA for the previous edit but I discovered my answer didn't work so I amended it. ;o) <comment8963> I haven't been able to get this to work once. What dialog boxes support this? What percentage of the time does this work for you given all the apps you use? <comment8964> @mankoff Try it while carrying out what the original question asked and it works <comment8967> I have "warn when changing" unselected so I never come across that dialog. In testing, CMD+K (keep) doesn't seem to work for me, only CMD+U (use). This answer, while useful when it works, seems to be only partially and occasionally valid. <comment34143> This *doesn't* work more often than not in my experience. <comment70515> As stated by the answers above, this doesn't just work out of the box. You have to enable it in System Preferences. <comment116577> As @fredley mentioned, this is not often the case. actually AFAICT it is rarely the case. Really really too bad. <comment117920> Yup, unfortunately when I answered the question I tested it in the specific scenario the question described and it worked but it's not universal I'm afraid. Pity... <comment153084> Is this still applicable to Mavericks? <comment161789> @JaydenLawson Yes, can confirm it's working on Mavericks. I don't know about Yosemite <comment168791> It is actually under the "Shortcuts" tab. System Perfs  Keyboard  Shortcuts <comment197838> This works in Sequel Pro. I found it very non-intuitive, which is how I ended up here. Thank you! <comment199607> @daviesgeek — And Tab does not switch dialog box ! Fortunately. <comment222711> I've found this to work in Office, but actually, you don't need to use `command` there. <comment255541> As @ChrisWatts said... these instructions are a little outdated, but still work as of El Capitan. these instructions ARE the most reliable way to achieve what OP said. The accepted answer isn't reliable. <comment261257> This is great. Thanks. <comment304363> This is definitely the correct answer.
