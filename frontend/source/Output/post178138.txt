Prevent Xcode from jumping to debugging after crash <body> Hey is there a way to prevent xcode from switching to the debug navigator every time an app crashes? I'd rather stay in the file I am working at a time, the "new" view is completely useless for me  <answer178192> Take a look under Preferences - Behaviors in Xcode. I haven't actually tested this myself, but going to Running - Pauses and unchecking to "Show navigator Debug navigator" and/or "Show debugger with Current Views" sounds like it should do what you want.   Alternately, you might want to play around with these settings to find something that suits you.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8hc7H.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment211040> Thanks so much! Never clicked on this before and now I realized how many hours this could've saved me in the last couple of months. <comment211041> @user2875404 Glad I could help! :D
