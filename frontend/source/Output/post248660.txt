Apps don't show up on Spotlight search <body> When using Spotlight on my Mac, and I type codeSpo/code... (trying to launch Spotify), I get suggestions for  the Spotify website, some apps from the App Store, and files containing a fraction of the word "spo" but no Spotify.app.  When trying to search for other apps using Spotlight, if the app shows up, the focus is not on the app, it is on a web search for the app name. This is really frustrating, as i type quickly and Spotlight launches Safari instead of the app I'm searching for.  I need to mention that I did a fresh install of OS X for 2-3 weeks (didn't restore my stuff from time machine backup. I did it the old fashioned way (copy/paste to external HDD, then back to Mac), but after my install Apple released an OS X update.   Please bring some light on this situation.  <answer268947> Anil (https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/40587/anil) answered in this question (Applications Don&#39;t Show Up in Spotlight).

Can't remember if it's inside of Privacy & Security or inside Spotlight. -- hope this helps. <comment337841> Welcome to Ask Different.
