My desktop turned black, I see the status bar at the top, but cannot see the wallpaper or dock <body> This happened two days ago on my MacBook Air 2011.  When I log into other accounts on the Mac, the wallpaper and dock are there.  So this only happens on the one account.  I am sure this is a simple fix, but want this account back as all my photos and files are on it.  Thanks.  <comment329768> Welcome to Ask Different.
