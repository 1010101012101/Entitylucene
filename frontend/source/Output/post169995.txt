What is analogous to the Windows registry in Mac OS X? <body> I am new to Mac and was wondering where application/OS settings are saved.  <answer169996> The typical place for this kind of information is one of  ul licode/System/Library/code (for OS specific stuff)/li licode/Library/code (for system-wide preferences/settings valid for all users)/li licode~/Library/code (for user-specific preferences/settings)/li /ul  and the folders beneath them (e.g. codeApplication Support/code and codePreferences/code).   They are saved as individual files, usually named so you can identify them and with a structure which is (at least most of the time) understandable by mere humans. Most of these files are Property List files ending in code.plist/code which can be pretty-printed into a human-readable form by running codeplutil -p NAME-OF-FILE.plist/code in Terminal.  <comment199811> A lot of configuration for unix-like settings and applications would be stored as in any other unix in dot-files in your home folder - all the files and folder starting with a dot under ~/.  For example, ~/.ssh/*, ~/.bash_profile and others. <comment199812> I think you need to mention the .plist files... <comment199832> How is this not a duplicate 4 1/2 years after this site was launched? <comment199878> You would be surprised how many apps on OS X are self-contained. Drag drop them out of your /Applications/ folder onto another machine, and you'll find most of them run fine -- try that on Windows :)
