How to prove this is a 42mm or 38mm Apple Watch? <body> I want to convince someone that this image belongs to the 42mm Apple Watch.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNGmb.png" alt=""  However I couldn't distinguish between them yet.  <answer202765> While that is just a rendering of the Apple Watch, not an image of an actual Apple Watch, the band is a Modern Buckle, which is only available for 38mm Apple Watches. So the Watch in the rendering is definitely a 38mm.  <answer202827> Pixel densities are 272Ã—340 and 312x390. If the image/photo is high res enough you could zoom in to count the pixels.
