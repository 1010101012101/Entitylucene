Keyboard and trackpad may become unresponsive - Macbook Air 13' Mid 2013 Yosemite <body> So it all began when I started having problems with sound - there were no sounds except the startup chord.  I repaired permissions many times, but it caused problems with display (displaypolicyd.plist). I decided to reinstall OS X Yosemite through OS X Recovery, erased my hard drive and reinstalled the system. But after all that, it still didn't work. I tried to plug in standard headphones but they didn't work either.  After this, the keyboard and trackpad became unresponsive for the first time. I've rebooted the MBA and it worked, problem disappeared. But it revealed itself again many times randomly (in all cases if the external mouse &amp; keyboard weren't plugged in, the MBA tried to search wireless ones.)  Today I found the solution for the sound problem (by deleting directory code/Library/Preferences/Audio/code), but the problem of unresponsiveness is still present.  I'd be glad if anyone helps me find the solution. Thank you.
