Show notification when unlocking iPhone <body> Is there a way to show a notification upon unlocking an iPhone? For example, I want to set a reminder to "do x" at 5 pm, but I don't unlock my phone until 5:30, but I would like the alert to pop up as soon as I unlock it.  <comment297165> No, I don't believe there's a way to do this <comment297166> @JohnRamos Darn. Thanks for your help! <comment297167> You can make a reminder with the preinstalled iOS reminders app and it will longer on your lockscreen until you mark it as done. <comment297168> @JohnRamos Yeah, I just wanted to make it more noticeable as soon as I unlock my phone <comment297169> There will be a badge icon (1) on the reminders app showing you that you have a new reminder, but that's it.
