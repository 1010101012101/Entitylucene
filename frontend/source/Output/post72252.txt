Is there a way to split the Cmd-Tab app list onto multiple rows? <body> Is there an app/program for OS X that will "split" the list of open apps that appears when you hit kbdâŒ˜/kbd-kbdtab/kbd into multiple rows?  This is the default behaviour for Windows 7 and it's really quite useful when you have lots of windows open, navigating with the arrow keys.  <answer72314> How about something like Witch? It may not be 100% what you're after, but I find it nicer than the built-in application switching.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgB3E.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment84002> Related to [How to change cmdtab on os x to make it behave like on windows or linux](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/10502/how-to-change-cmdtab-on-os-x-to-make-it-behave-like-on-windows-or-linux) <comment84638> Nice, thats awesome!
