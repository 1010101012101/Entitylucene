NAS Disk Drive is Slow and Reconnect over time <body> I have a Synology 212J NAS with latest Diskstation. On Windows, once i set the drive it will auto connect at login, and I can access it anytime i want.  On Mac it doesn't do that. Now I have discovered to drag the Drive in Users  Login Items, so that it auto connect during Login, but the initial access of the drive is still slow, as if it is loging in again.  And if i leave the Network drive alone for a few hours, clicking on it again will have to wait 3-4 seconds before opening. This is in stack contrast with Windows where the wait would be MAX 2 seconds.   Anyone know the reason why this is happening and how to fix it? I was expecting a much smoother UX on the Mac.   <comment254509> Which protocol are you using for the access? SMB or AFS?
