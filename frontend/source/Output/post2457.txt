What to do with broken iPhone 3G? <body> A friend order an iPhone 4 to replace his iPhone 3G which has a cracked screen. He offered it to me.   I have AT&amp;T on a family plan with no text or data. What should I do with the phone?  I'm open to suggestions, but I'm considering...  ul lifixing the screen and then selling it. I'd put that money towards purchasing the iPhone 4 with a data plan./li lifixing the screen and keeping it./li liselling without fixing the screen./li /ul  I guess I could keep it without fixing the screen too, but...  <answer2458> You can buy very cheap screen replacements on ebay (about AU$30). I have fitted one of these myself, it is not too hard.  <answer2462> I sold mine emwithout/em fixing it and got a nice price on ebay.  <answer2464> use it as a External HardDrive.  <comment2152> A 3G? I'm curious how much. The 3G *S* is $99 *new*. <comment2162> somewhat over $100. Don't ask me to explain it, I can't. <comment2170> Nice price. Don't bother explaining. ;) <comment2514> I probably will do this, but not from eBay. I prefer iFixit (or anything) over eBay. <comment2515> The price probably fell since iPhone 4 came out. <comment2520> @Moshe the phone fell, the price fell ... <comment2522> @bmargulies - :-)
