Recommendation for an iPhone app that will leave a note on the lock screen until cleared? <body> I'm sure most of you are familiar with the idea of leaving a note on the door / on top of your keys / somewhere where you'll have to see it before you leave, in order to remind you to do something / take something with you at a point in time...  I'm looking for something similar for the iPhone which is easy to use, and deposits a persistent 'note' on the lock screen, until you explicitly dismiss it.   I have found a couple of apps which offer this, but they tend to revolve around changing the background image which I am not too fond of (I'd prefer some solution that uses the actual Apple Notifications API).  Any suggestions?  Thanks!
