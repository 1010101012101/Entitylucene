Special Characters keyboard shortcut in Gmail <body> I've found the "special characters" keyboard shortcut (control-command-space) very useful when I have to use Greek letters in text. However, this shortcut does not work when writing e-mails in Gmail, even though it does seem to work in the Gmail instant message boxes.   Is there a way to assign this shortcut in Gmail? (It's not clear to me why it doesn't work.)   Thanks!  Edit: I use Safari to access my e-mail. I've found that I am also unable to use the special characters shortcut for new e-mails in Gmail when using Chrome, but that everything works fine in Firefox.  <comment144561> Where are you accessing Gmail from? If from a browser, which one? <comment144562> What is "Gmail" to you? <comment144835> Oops, I forgot to mention this. I use Gmail from the a browser, usually Safari. I have checked and the control-command-space shortcut for special characters does not work when writing an e-mail using Gmail in Safari or Chrome, but it does seem to work in Firefox. Is there a way for it to work in Safari or Chrome? <comment321240> I have noticed this too BTW. Control-Command-Space does not work in the Gmail message input areas. It does work of course on the URL bar. (which is not exactly useful ) <comment321242> Just tested, FYI this behavior happens with keyboard shortcuts turned off or on. Going to dig further
