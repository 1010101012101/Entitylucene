How do I change the default font-family for all slides in keynote <body> I am using  keynote 2009 and I want all my slides to have the font-family "Courier". I tried playing with master slides but when I create a new slide it defaults to "Gill Sans".  Any help is appreciated.  <answer14343> Drag your altered master slide over the new slide with the incorrect font. When you make a new slide, have one whose master slide has the desired font selected.  <answer32682> You can change the Master Slide to get the fonts you want, and if you’d like this to be the default, then you can save this out as a template.  (Caveat: I only have iWork ’11 in front of me, but I believe it's the same, for iWork ’09).  To change the default font for a emsingle/em slideshow:  ol liOpen the complete set of master slides. codeView/code  codeShow Master Slides/code./li liFind the master slide(s) that corresponds to slides that you’ve used in your presentation. Open the Fonts panel (codeFormat/code  codeFont/code  codeShow Fonts/code, or the codeFonts/code item in the toolbar)./li liSelect everything in the slide (codeEdit/code  codeSelect All/code, or code⌘A/code), and then, in the Fonts panel, select Courier instead of Gill Sans./li liRepeat for every master slide you need./li liCreate a Text Box and format it with the font/style you want. Then select it and choose codeFormat/code  codeAdvanced/code  codeDefine Text for All Masters/code. /li /ol  Now, if you want this template for emevery/em slideshow you do, then first make these edits on every master slide, in a blank slideshow. (Every slide should now have Courier instead of Gill Sans as the default font).  Then save this out as a theme (codeFile/code  codeSave theme…/code). Call it something descriptive, like codeCourier Black/code, and just save it.  Now, next time the Theme Chooser pops up, you’ll be able to choose your codeCourier Black/code variant, which will have Courier as the default.  <answer118998> I hope you get to read this - the others were really not the best advice IT IS strongMUCH MUCH/strong SIMPLER   Select a MASTER text box and change it's font. emFormat  Advanced  Define Text for Current Master/em or emDefine Text for All Masters/em  <comment81014> How do you have iWork 11 if the latest one released is 09? <comment111332> @slhck: good question, I have no idea what I thought when I was writing that. :S <comment147519> What's a master text box and how do you create one? <comment216237> "master text box" means any text box on any master slide. <comment219649> 'Repeat for every master slide you need.' OK, so this answer is 'you have to do it manually'. This is plainly incorrect - see below. <comment338149> Thank you! This should be part of the main answer.
