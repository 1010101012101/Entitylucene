How to kill the iCloud daemon? <body> I want to slay codecom.apple.iCloudHelper/code forever so that it will not respawn. I already know about codelaunchctl/code and the 6 different locations that codedaemons/code and codeagents/code can live in and that sometimes daemons die when you use codesudo/code and others without codesudo/code and sometimes they need the codeplist/code suffix and sometimes they don't.  In fact I wrote a function in bash which tries all these combinations for me  precodefunction vajra () {     # http://launchd.info/                                                                  # Type           Location                       Run on behalf of                        # User Agents    ~/Library/LaunchAgents         Currently logged in user                # Global Agents  /Library/LaunchAgents          Currently logged in user                # Global Daemons /Library/LaunchDaemons         Root or specified user (UserName)       # System Agents  /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Currently logged in user                # System Daemons /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  Root or specified user (UserName)       NAME=$1     PASS=0     for privelege in '' 'sudo'     do         for pfx in '' /Library/LaunchAgents/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Users/pushpendre\ rastogi/Library/LaunchAgents/ /System/Library/LaunchAgents/ /System/Library/LaunchDaem\ ons/         do             for sfx in '' '.plist'             do                 CMD="$privelege launchctl unload -w ${pfx}${NAME}${sfx}"                 # echo $CMD                                                                             OUTPUT=`$CMD 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep "No such file or directory" | wc -l`                 if [ $OUTPUT = 0 ]                 then                     PASS=1                     echo $CMD                 fi             done         done     done     echo $PASS } /code/pre  This function could one-hit-kill any daemon or so I thought, till I encountered codecom.apple.iCloudHelper/code. None of my incantations work on it and therefore I am here asking for suggestions for killing this daemon.
