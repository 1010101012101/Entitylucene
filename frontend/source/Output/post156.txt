How to minimize all windows/applications to the dock? <body> kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdM/kbd as mentioned in multiple docs only appears to minimize the current (focused) window.  I am looking for the "Show Desktop" equivalent.  If it matters I'm using 10.6.4.    <answer160> kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdM/kbd actually minimizes all windows of a current application, not just the current focused window (unless of course, the application you have running only has one non-minimized window.)  The easiest way to hide all active applications is to select the Finder/Desktop, and then "Hide Others." The keyboard shortcut is kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdH/kbd.  You can also simply hold kbd&#x2325;/kbd and kbd&#x2318;/kbd and click on the Desktop, or Finder on the Dock, or of course, simply use Expose and hit kbdF11/kbd (Or whatever you've rebound Hide-all to.)  <answer327> I just use Hot Corners to do it.     System Preferences  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver  Hot Corners  Select "Desktop" from one of the dropdowns. I use the bottom left, since that's where I was used to the Desktop button in XP lol.   <answer93160> I finally found how to do it with kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdH/kbd+kbdM/kbd.  This works for me on Mac OS X Lion.  <comment84> Didn't realize the differentiation between focused/other windows of an app before.   Option-Command-H works as planned.  If you have a app focused it will leave that one alone also. <comment86> Yup, hence my suggestion to select the Finder first if you want to show desktop. It's actually "Hide Others", not "Hide All", so that makes sense. <comment230> Careful for apps that override the default keystrokes with their own. Photoshop is particularly annoying in this regard. <comment290> Love the [command] + [option] + [click on desktop] tip - that's really useful! <comment335> I always switched to finder and then used Hide Others, never knew you could click the icon on the dock to do it though!  Very handy tip thanks <comment130862> Unfortunately this will not work if you have Firefox running. <comment256300> The question asks how to minimize all windows TO THE DOCK, not hide them or show the desktop. Somehow, mac people are happy to "hide" a window rather than minimizing to the dock, but I prefer the latter. No one has attempted to answer the question, I'm disappointed to say. I guess it's because it can't be done. Too bad.
