Preserve subfolders when archiving in Outlook for Mac <body> Outlook for Mac 2011 (14.2.2) doesn't appear to have any archive (auto, or otherwise) functionality. Most of the advice on the web seems to suggest rule based archiving, however this seems to only permit flat structures for the messages once they are archived.  For example, archive all messages more than 6 months old to folder "x", whereas I want to preserve the folder structure (Exchange) that I work in.  I already have another imported back up running locally (from a PC running Windows Outlook) in this Mac with the same folder structure, and want to be able to backup to it without doing it on a folder by folder basis.  Any ideas?
