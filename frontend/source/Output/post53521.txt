How to control manual double-side printing on Mac OS X Lion? <body> I have an HP 1022 printer attached to my Mac OS X Lion.   When I try to print a 4-page PDF file from Preview or Adobe Reader, it prints pages 1 and 3 and then all 3 lights on the HP 1022 printer start blinking.  I suspect that perhaps the printer or the system is in some kind of manual double-side printing mode, but I could not find where I can turn it on or off using the Mac OS printing dialogs.  How can one control manual double-side printing on a Mac OS X Lion?  <answer53549> You can go to codePrint &amp; Scan/code in the system preferences and select codeOptions &amp; Supplies/code for your printer. In there, you should see an option for codeDuplex Unit/code (if your printer supports it). If that is checked, you can use the automatic double-side printing (by checking the codeTwo-sided/code box next to codeCopies/code). If not, or if that option is unavailable, you can't.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wYYd.png" alt="enter image description here"  In case you can't select that option, here's how you can manually print double-sided pages.  h3Manual double-side printing/h3  You can control manual double-side printing (i.e., you physically turn the sheets over) using the codePaper Handling/code setting in the print dialog.  If you select codePaper Handling/code, you'll find a codePages to Print/code option that lets you print either only the odd pages or only the even pages (default is both). To print double side manually, select codeOdd Only/code first and when it finishes printing, flip the pages over and select codeEven Only/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TE4Xn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Instead of flipping emeach page/em over to its blank side before printing the even pages, you have a more convenient option of flipping emthe entire block of pages/em, so that the last sheet is on top (useful when you have a lot of pages to be printed). With this, you can then choose codeReverse/code in codePage Order/code to print the even numbered pages backwards. (Note: be careful that if you have an odd-number of pages in total, you might have to leave the last one out before printing the even ones.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cEXMy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer105938> In a search, I just found this great tool from HP that facilitates manual duplex printing from OSX with minimal steps. I just tried it with success using my Epson NX-515.  http://whp-hou9.cold.extweb.hp.com/pub/softlib/software12/COL35975/mp-88750-2/HP_Two-sided_Printing.dmg  <answer111585> With my printer I can:  ol liSelect Paper Handling  Pages to Print  Odd Only and print the pages./li liInsert the pile of papers on the tray again so that the printed side is facing up and the text is not upside down./li liSelect Paper Handling  Pages to Print  Even Only and print the pages./li /ol  With a printer that prints on the other side, follow the steps described by rm -rf:  ol liSelect Paper Handling  Pages to Print  Odd Only and print the pages./li liIf the total number of pages is odd, remove the last page/li liFlip the pile of papers and insert it on the tray./li liSelect Paper Handling  Pages to Print  Even Only, select Paper Handling  Pages to Print  Reverse, and print the pages./li /ol  <answer218248> I've found that for my printer at least (a Brother HL-3070CW), it's easier to:  ul liprint the strongeven/strong pages strongfirst/strong/li liflip the pages so the printed side is up and put them back in the tray/li liprint the strongodd/strong pages/li /ul  This way you end up with the pages in the correct order when finished and don't have to worry about selecting emreverse/em.  <comment61271> Now I'm curious what was sensitive enough in your printer's name to need censoring.
