AppleScript check if Chrome Extension is installed <body> strongUsing AppleScript, I need to check if Adblock Plus (ABP) is installed in the Chrome Browser./strongbr After numerous attempts at trying to figure out how, I have come to the conclusion that it would be relatively easy to check if the ABP "firstRun.html" exists.     Or is there a more reliable script to check if this specific extension is installed?  Here is my script, however strongit always returns true/strong. Please Help.  precodeif checkIfABPInstalled() is true then     log "FOUND" else     log "NOT FOUND" end if   on checkIfABPInstalled()     try         tell application "Google Chrome"             if ("chrome-extension://cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb/firstRun.html") exists then                 return true             else                 return false             end if         end tell     on error         return false     end try end checkIfABPInstalled /code/pre  <answer255204> Google Chrome's AppleScript Dictionary doesn't have a direct method to check for extensions, so you need to test for the Adblock Plus extension in a different way.  If the Adblock Plus extension is installed, then the codeadblockplus.js/code file will exist within the code"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions//code directory structure. So I'd test for its existence and the example AppleScript emcode/em below does that.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset fileExists to do shell script "find \"$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions\" -iname adblockplus.js 2&gt;/dev/null"  if fileExists is not "" then     display dialog "Adblock Plus is installed." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 else     display dialog "Adblock Plus is not installed." buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon caution end if /code/pre  <comment317797> Thank you, this worked perfectly for me.
