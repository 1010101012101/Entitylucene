El Capitan startup screens <body> After installing El Capitan (Currently on 10.11.3), the screen starts with a login prompt, which then displays a progress bar. At about 30%, the screen goes gray, then a faster progress bar completes the process.  I have read several answers and it seems to be related to Filevault.  I did have a GPU problem (MBP early 2011) which I resolved by entering a script available online, where I did modify the boot process disabling the discrete graphics and after that the boot started to display this additional progress bar; since then the motherboard was replaced (Thanks, Apple!), then I deleted all those extra features yet the startup screens remained.    Is there a way to have just one progress bar for the whole process?  I find that greyscreen somewhat annoying.  <answer231519> There are several ways you can fix this issue.   ul liReset NVRAM/li liTry starting up in Safe Mode/li liPress and hold the power button for a few seconds until your computer turn off, then release the power button./li /ul  Source: Apple Toolbox  <comment282741> I did, it's a nogo, but thanks! <comment282743> Sorry to hear that :(
