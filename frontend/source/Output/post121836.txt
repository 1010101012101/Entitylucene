OSX Mavericks VPN PPTP <body> I have an issue with vpn pptp connection on my macbook. The latest version of Mavericks is installed. The log (/var/log/ppp.log) is provided below  precodeFri Feb 21 20:08:33 2014 : Warning: can't open options file /etc/ppp/peers/int: Permission denied Fri Feb 21 20:08:33 2014 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success! Fri Feb 21 20:08:33 2014 : publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success! Fri Feb 21 20:08:33 2014 : Fatal signal 13 Fri Feb 21 20:08:33 2014 : can't talk to PPPController : Broken pipe /code/pre  File is not exists on my system, I had tried to create it also had changed chmod  precode/etc/ppp/peers/int /code/pre  This VPN works properly on my iphone and windows pc.   Also I don't have any problems with connection using command line:  precodesudo networksetup -connectpppoeservice int /code/pre  I don't have possibility to check other VPN types, but I had tried to connect to PPTP servers on Windows and Linux OS.  <answer178213> i ran also in the exact same issue. Apple Forums did not really lead to a solution.  Rebooting on the other hand solved the issue completely.
