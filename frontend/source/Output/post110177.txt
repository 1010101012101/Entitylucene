Logitech Mouse: how can I use additional buttons? <body> I recently bought a Logitech M560 mouse.   It works fine on my Mac, but I wonder if there's a software/prefpane (free or paid) I can use to map the additional buttons I have on my mouse (i.e. to open dashboard, select line, etc...)  Logitech at the moment offers no support for Mac for this model (I was aware of this when I bought the mouse)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wfijv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Without any configuration the bottom side button works as "Add bookmark" in Chrome, so I think I can do something for this...  <answer110178> I've used Steermouse in the past with excellent results.  <answer110213> I have used USB Overdrive     The USB Overdrive is a device driver for Mac OS X that handles any USB   mouse / trackball / joystick / gamepad / media keyboard and any   Bluetooth mouse from any manufacturer and lets you configure them   either globally or on a per-application, per-device basis. Note that   the Apple Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad are not handled by the USB   Overdrive to let Mac OS X implement its full multitouch support.   Worked really well .  <answer110219> h2BetterTouchTool/h2  BetterTouchTool will allow you to map mouse buttons to keyboard shortcuts or predefined actions. Simply click in the area with the button that you want to map, select a modifier key if you wish, then choose a keyboard shortcut or predefined action to map.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NCb5Q.png"  <answer115225> Thanks to the previous answers, I have successfully used BetterTouchTool to map three different buttons:  ul liUsign "Normal Mice" tab: ul liButton 3 (Wheel Left)/li liButton 4 (Wheel right)/li /ul/li liUsign "Keyboard" tab: ul licmd + D (Back), which I assigned to "Middle click"./li /ul/li /ul  Two buttons remain unmappable (Forward and Middle click), but it is better than nothing. Hope that it will fit to your needs.  <answer193277> According to an answer on a similar question, it's possible to use a program called Karabiner to detect the Logitec Windows-specific keyboard events sent by the M560, and translate them to regular keyboard or mouse button events that tools such as BetterTouchTool can pick up on.  Please see the original answer on the duplicate question for full details, including a Karabiner configuration file for the M560.  <answer288958> If you're interested in using the side buttons for navigation, I made an open-source menu bar utility called SensibleSideButtons that solves this problem. Instead of binding the side buttons to keyboard shortcuts like most of the other programs mentioned here, mine instead binds them to virtual left and right swipe gestures. This approach offers several benefits: almost universal adoption across the OS (including Xcode), avoidance of destructive behavior, no menu bar blink or annoying noises, commands only sent to the specific window under your cursor.  (This assumes that your side buttons emit standard M4 and M5 events.)  <comment129817> I have, too.  But note that you may need to *uninstall* the Logitech preference-pane before Steermouse can see the Logitech mouse.  More complication: if you have *other* Logitech devices as well, configure them while the preference-pane is there, then uninstall it. <comment129821> A common reccommendation is [USB Overdrive](http://www.usboverdrive.com/USBOverdrive/News.html) but I don't know how well it works with this mouse <comment129866> @Napolux http://smoothmouse.com/ maybe of assistance <comment129936> Not working with the M560. Additional buttons are not recognized. <comment129937> Bad UI, I didn't find out how to use it <comment129942> SteerMouse is not working with this mouse. <comment129951> @Napolux Make sure you haven't got any other mouse drivers/software that might affect it (go to BTT â†’ Settings and check the [potential conflicts list](http://cl.ly/SQH0) at the bottom), and don't forget to give BTT accessibility access :) <comment129956> Possibly later version than when I used it last.It was simple enough.. Hover over prefpane, click a button which has the button table detect the button and jumps to it's controls. There is a step by step guide on the site. But I cannot <comment129990> I did it. No success... <comment136129> I've contacted SteerMouse regarding M560 support: "Unfortunately SteerMouse does not support all buttons on the mouse. Probably some special device commands are required to support it, but we do not know about the commands." <comment183101> This does not seem to have a 'forward' button support, 'back' button was simulated by setting it to delete. <comment243420> Thanks, "USB Overdrive" also worked for my Logitech RX250. This mouse includes a tilting scroll wheel which adds two mouse buttons. However, they are not recognized by OS X 10.10 even after installing "Logitech Control Center for Mac" (LCC 3.9.2). With "USB Overdrive" I can simple map these buttons to mouse buttond 4 and 5 and then assign these in Mission Control. <comment257201> Nice. I've added Mimicking Standard Gestures - 3F Swipe Left/Right to enable standard functionality that is back/forward for these buttons. <comment261041> Added action `3F Swipe Left (Page Back)` for Button 3 and `3F Swipe Left (Page Forward)` for Button 4 fixed the problem for me! <comment282156> $20 to use BetterTouchTool. Free with Karabiner. See https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/issues/329 <comment295734> I had an issue with Steermouse v4 not supporting the tilt wheel on my Dell branded mouse. An upgrade to v5 - currently in beta but working fine for me - resolve that issue and notably improved the interface. <comment323684> It bears mentioning that Steermouse is trialware 30 days free and $19.99 afterward
