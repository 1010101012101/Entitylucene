Sierra: Mail client's "Rules" window UI has a bug <body> It was working a couple of days ago, I was able to set couple of mail rules. But from yesterday, I am seeing that rule window's "perform the following actions" space is so narrow (not draggable) that I can't do anything there. What is going on? you can see it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/83Kes.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any pointer will be appreciated.  <comment363239> It's been doing this on & off since forever [maybe Mavericks or earlier], though I've never seen it so narrow that you can no longer interact with it at all. The trick was to make one rule with a lot of actions, which would sometimes 'force' the window open for shorter lists... but if you can't even get to the first action, then idk :/
