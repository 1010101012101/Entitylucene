ASP & PHP Web Server on OS X <body> On Windows, I ran Xampp on port 80 for PHP/MySQL and IIS on port 8080 for ASP.  For OS X, what's the best route to take...  ul liShould I just run Xampp for Mac for PHP/mySQL, or is there a better option since this is Unix?/li liWhat's the best (free) way to run ASP off a mac?/li /ul  <answer6426> i can answer part of this question - MAMP is made for mac. it stands for Mac, Apache, MySQL, PHP and is free. mamp.info for details. asp... no idea  <answer6427> For the first part of your question you can use XAMPP on mac OS X too.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8kn2.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer6428> I've never used it any of them, but there is a port of Mono for Mac that allows you to run ASP.NET on the Mac, and as other users answered there is XAMPP for Mac also.  http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX  <answer6530> Mono works relatively well, but some sites built using ASP require Windows-only components (like Windows Forms) that it can't support. I was able to build it but it took some time and hand editing of various dependencies and make files.  As for PHP/MySQL, you do have them already in Mac OS X. You may need to do a bit of leg work to get them working together as you'd like. MAMP and EMAMP are ok, but I almost always run into gotchas when I use them. They're no replacement for a good, stock Apache build with some mods backed up to a text file on Dropbox...  <answer175143> good news: Abyss will run asp, asp.net, php, and even ruby.  bad news: it's not designed for professionals; only for nooooobs.  <comment6704> you wanted PHP too, right? so MAMP, and something else for ASP <comment7089> I think I will end up leaving the ASP run on my Windows box... not worth the work if its not rigorous (I also have MSSQL integrated... it would be a mess to transfer).  With PHP, I'm going to give XAMPP for mac a shot first (because it worked well for me in Win).  I'll check out MAMP if things don't go so well.
