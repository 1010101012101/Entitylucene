text messages going to exchange email <body> Ever since I added my exchange email my text messages, especially group messages, are going to my email account as emails with attachments and not showing up in the messages app. I wasn't having this problem before I added an exchange email and it's awful because as an email there aren't any names attached so I don't know who it's from!  All I could find when I did a search on it was to turn off iMessaging but that's a big feature to loose! Isn't there a more specific setting? On android phones when this happens you just turn off message sync under your email settings but I can't find an iPhone equivalent.
