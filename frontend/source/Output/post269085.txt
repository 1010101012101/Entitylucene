Can't connect 2 external monitors to new Macbook Pro <body> I just received my new MacBook Pro 15" Touchbar (16GB RAM, Radeon 4G). I connected it to 2 external Dell S2715H monitors with USB-C to HDMI adapter connected to the 2 left Thunderbolt 3 ports.  I want the two monitors to work along with my 15" laptop screen. The problem is that the 2 external monitors just doesn't work together. When only one is connected it's working perfectly, but when they are both connected - only one works.  Any ideas how to solve it?  <comment338146> I presume that *each* monitor works with **either cable** by itself, just not both at the same time(?). Also let us know what the contents of the Displays preference pane show when both monitors are connected. A screen shot is best <comment338195> 1. yes. 2. http://imageshack.com/a/img923/6368/lnjAmk.png . BTW - the "Detect Displays" button does nothing.
