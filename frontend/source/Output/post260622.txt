Chrome find bar closing on macOS Sierra <body> Previously on Chrome, I could use kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdF/kbd to bring up the Chrome find bar, then kbdesc/kbd would close it. However, on macOS Sierra, kbdesc/kbd now exits full-screen mode if the Chrome window is in this mode (which I commonly use).  What is the shortcut to close the find bar? Alternatively, how do I disable kbdesc/kbd closing full-screen mode?  <answer260624> A simple workaround to close the find bar is to use codeFn + Esc/code, rather then codeEsc/code.  hr  However, you can easily prevent Chrome to close the full-sceen mode by pressing codeEsc/code through this script (following this post):  precode// ==UserScript== // @name           Keep Full Screen // @namespace     https://superuser.com/q/315949 // @description    Prevents Escape key from leaving full screen. // @include      http://* // ==/UserScript== document.onkeydown = function (evt) {     if (evt.keyCode == 27) evt.preventDefault(); } /code/pre  To run this, you can use the NinjaKit Google Chrome extension.  <comment326466> `fn` + `esc` works perfectly - thanks! :)
