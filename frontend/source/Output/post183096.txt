How to add watermark to all video files in a folder? (Mac, mencoder, terminal) <body> Is there a way to add watermark to all (mp4) video files in a folder.  I have like 1000 videos in one folder and It'll take a long time to change one by one manually - so, maybe, there is some kind of a tool / software?  Maybe, it's possible to do somehow with codemencoder/code that I can run in terminal?  <answer183106> You should be able to do it from the terminal with ffmpeg's overlay filter ... download prebuilt binaries or install with Homebrew if you don't have it already and the command would look something like this:  precodeffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex 'overlay=10:10' outputname.mp4 /code/pre  That'll place watermark.png 10px in and 10px down from the top right corner ...  <comment218186> Thank you very much, you made my day.
