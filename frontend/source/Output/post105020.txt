iOS 7 new phone restore <body> I have an iPhone 4S that I dropped in the toilet. It's fried. So I just bought another iPhone 4S. It turns on as a iOS 6 device, which I set up and I'm activated. I updated it to iOS 7 and now I can't figure out how to restore my old phone's backup. I don't know how to reset without going back to iOS 6. My backup is on iCloud. Any ideas?  <answer105048> It seems like you have already completed a base setup of your new iPhone (meaning, you have used the strongSetup Assistant/strong to set it up and have reached the home screen). In that case, follow these steps to restore the old phone's iCloud backup into the new iPhone:  ul liGo to strongSettings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings/strong and erase it (enter passcode if prompted). The phone will then restart./li liEnsure you have a WiFi connection, and when the strongSetup Assistant/strong shows up ul liProceed to strongSet up your device/strong/li liTap strongRestore from a Backup/strong/li liThen sign in to iCloud/li liProceed to strongChoose backup/strong, then choose from a list of available backups in iCloud./li /ul/li /ul  See:br Restoring from a previous iCloud backupbr Restore from iCloud
