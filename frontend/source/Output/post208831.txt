Using ipad with keyboard – viable as ssh terminal for development? <body> Currently I'm using a macbook pro as my development machine. My workflow basically consists of logging in to an ec2 instance via ssh and there working on the shell using emacs.   I wonder if the same would also be possible using an ipad and an external keyboard. Maybe even the upcoming ipad pro.   I a question here from 2012 How to ssh from iPad with external keyboard and Emacs? regarding external keyboard on ipad and using emacs – the ansers don't sound very encouraging, as there seem to be some problems to either send meta-key or control-key. I found some other old articles on the internet, all of them seem to indicate some problems regarding escape keys.   But a lot of time has passed since then, so my question: what is the current state of using the ipad as ssh terminal and using emacs on the remote machine via external ipad keyboard?
