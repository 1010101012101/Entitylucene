Can I port a specific app and its data to a newer version of MacOS with Time Machine? <body> I have MacBook Pro late 2014 and it's running Mac OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan and I found out that I don't have recovery mode installed and I can't turn off sip. So I'm going to clean install MacOS Sierra and I'm a programmer I have a lot of programming apps and a lot of data and plugins for those apps. My question is can use Time Machine to specifically choose an app and its data to be ported to the new OS, or is there another approach?  <comment341205> Wouldn't it just be simpler to create a recovery partition? http://musings.silvertooth.us/downloads-2/ <comment341206> ok,thank u 4 ur answer ill try it
