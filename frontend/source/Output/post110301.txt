Built-in Webcam working only in 1 app and not in others (15'' MBP, non-retina, mid 2012) <body> I have a MBP 15'' (late 2012; bought in June 2013) and I've noticed that the built-in Webcam doesn't work - except with Cisco WebMeeting!!  I had recently opened the laptop to change the HD, so I thought I had touched the camera connection, or something -- but then I found the camera works in emone/em app!!  h2The issues:/h2  ul liTrying to use the WebCam to get pictures/video from any of the "usual" suspects says "there is no built-in camera available"./li liI've tried with may applications:  ul liSnag-It ("Capture - New Image Capture - Webcam"): The app goes into "capture" mode but nothing happens/li liEvernote (File - New FaceTime Camera Note): I get a Black "preview" screen that says "Evernote Couldn't find a Webcam"/li liFaceTime: I get a black window with a "crossed out" icon of a camera/li liPhotoBooth: A different window, with the same crossed out icon, and a message "there is no connected camera":/li /ul/li /ul  Checking in System Information, I strongcan/strong see the camera listed so it's not a "hardware not connected" problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/92IM1.jpg" alt="System information report"  So imagine my shock when mucking about in a Webex, I noticed the "camera" icon and I clicked it, thinking that it wouldn't work, and the result was:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pQIdm.jpg" alt="Ugly mug blurred to protect sensibilities!"  (I've blurred my ugly mug in the picture to protect the sensibility of innocent bystanders!)  So, any hints of what might be the issue??  <answer113606> Just as a follow-up  After a few days (and a reboot, I embelieve/em but I'm not sure), the camera started working again for all that didn't, and "stayed" working for the ones that it didn't...  I'm a bit miffed by it, and if I can reproduce again will re-post here.
