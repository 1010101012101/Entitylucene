Why is my Final Cut Pro library file so bloated? <body> I have a bit of a problem with Final Cut Pro.  Specifically, my library file is now 22GB, which, on a 120GB SSD (I'm running a MacBook Air with OS X El Capitan) is way too big.  I've been careful to select "leave files in place" whenever I import media into Final Cut Pro, yet the library file is still growing and growing.  Am I doing anything wrong or do I just have to offload my Final Cut Pro library to a bigger drive?  UPDATE: I didn't realize until now that the different versions of Final Cut Pro were so different.  I'm running the latest version of Final Cut Pro X from the Mac App Store.  <answer229652> You are right to leave media in the original location to help save space. Beyond this setting, take a look at your Library's settings.  h1Manage Storage Locations/h1  Final Cut Pro is likely creating proxy and optimised copies of your original media. By default, these temporary files are stored within your Final Cut Pro libraries. You can change the location of temporary files, see Final Cut Pro X: Manage storage locations.  When you finish working on a project, ask Final Cut Pro to delete all associated runtime created files:  strongFinal Cut Pro.app  File (menu)  Delete Generated Library Filesâ€¦/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QVMNd.png" alt="Final Cut Pro: Delete Generated Library Files"  This will dramatically reduce the file size of your library.
