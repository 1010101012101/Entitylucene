Can QuickTime Pro convert .mpg to .mov? <body> I am thinking about purchasing QuickTime Pro for emWindows/em, but I have not been able to find a list of video file formats that it takes as input.  Does QuickTime Pro for Windows convert .mpg files to .mov?  Thank you!  <answer57273> It strongdoes/strong. Here you can find a list of all the import and export formats QuickTime Pro 7.7 supports.  <comment65748> Any reason to? A .mov is basically just a MPEG container. With what Codec is the actual video encoded? <comment65750> @Gerry  I am using [VideoMach](http://gromada.com/videomach/) on Windows to compile many bitmap files and it says that the Codec is "MPEG-1".  VideoMach does not directly export to **.mov**, unfortunately. <comment65751> I'd suggest using standard MPEG4 containers, unless you have a specific reason for using .mov? <comment65752> @Gerry  Thanks, my friend who is a Mac user sometimes has trouble playing **.mpg** files that I send him.  I am a Windows user, so I'm not exactly sure what goes wrong sometimes when he tries to play them.
