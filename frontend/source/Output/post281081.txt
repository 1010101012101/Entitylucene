Can I connect a wired keyboard (and mouse) to an iPhone with a non-working screen? <body> If an iPhone as a non-working screen (not detecting touch) or cracked screen.  Is there a way to connect a keyboard (and preferably: a mouse connected to the keyboard) using a USB powered hub?    Or would I need some low power Lightning keyboard?  <comment353657> Nope, the iPhone doesn't work with wired or wireless mice. Only Android, Windows Phone, Ubuntu...oh sorry.
