Copy window between multiple Spaces in Mission Control? <body> When I open Mission Control, I see that I can drag windows between Spaces and that moves the window to that Space.  What I want is to emcopy/em the window instance so I can interact with it on any of the Spaces.  This is very common functionality for virtual desktop programs on Windows (like Dexpot), where for example I can have my email program always available as I move around to different desktops. I'd like to do this same thing with Mission Control.  <answer159567> AFAIK you can't do this in Mission Control, but you can get the same result by right-clicking the application icon in the Dock and assigning the application to all desktops.  <answer159578> You can't get one window of an app to follow you to all Spaces - but you can, if you have shortcut keys setup to swap Spaces, grab the menu bar of the required window, hit the shortcut &amp; 'take it with you' to the new Space.  If you don't have it set up already, System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcutsâ€¦ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/buwKY.png" alt="enter image description here"  One thing to note - if you do that with Finder windows, it can break the 'click desktop to go back to Space 1' functionality, til you relaunch the Finder.  <comment187514> That appears to be whole applications, though... I'm looking for a way to do individual windows. Like, I don't want ALL Safari windows to be on all spaces, just ONE window.
