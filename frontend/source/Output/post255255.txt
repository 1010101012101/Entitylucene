MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2012) yellow tint when watching Netflix or YouTube in fullscreen <body> I noticed recently that when I try to watch YouTube videos or Netflix in full screen on my Macbook Air, the whole screen will wash out with orange and yellow and I can't see anything. But it's perfectly fine if I don't watch it in fullscreen. And on Netflix, if I use subtitles, it's normal when someone is talking, but when the text disappears the screen gets an orange tint again.  I've tried calibrating the colors through the display section of system preferences but it always tells me that there is an error. I've searched for someone who is having a similar problem but haven't found anyone.  <answer255315> Same thing is happening with mine. If I keep my mouse on the play bar at the bottom and keep that up the whole time it doesn't happen, but as soon as I drift my mouse away from the play bar it happens again.  <answer255321> There are two possibilities:  ol liThere's a software bug, in which case you should upgrade to the latest software if you're not up to date./li liIf that doesn't seem to solve it, it could possibly be a hardware issue, although it would seem more likely for it to be a software issue./li /ol  Solution:  Do an update to the latest software on your computer if you're not up to date. Otherwise, check the status of your hardware and/or take it in to a computer repair shop and get it diagnosed.  -T  <answer255589> I noticed that this yellow tint problem just occurs on chrome but not on safari. I updated chrome and tested it out - still happening. I then restarted my MBA and it disappeared. Will observe that problem for the next days but I hope that helps anyone. Also, I hardly restart or shut down my MBA, it's been on or in standby for over 2 months.  Update: still happening but found a new solution. I deactivated my extension 'Magic Actions for Youtube' and the problem disappeared. Again I will check if it still occurs.  <answer255791> A chrome extension called "Picture in Picture" seemed to be affecting fullscreen on youtube and netflix by tinting or yellowing.  Deleted this extension and so far so good.  <comment317892> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/253865/88313 <comment317942> Updating all my software just solved it for me. <comment317979> Welcome to Ask Different!

Unfortunately I don't have any of the chrome extensions mentioned so they can't be the source of the pb... I talked to Netfilx support. They tried to help with no success. Google Chrome support wanted to charge me $69!!!!
