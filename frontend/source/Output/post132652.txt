Can I code using Swift on Mavericks? <body> Is is possible to code using Swift on OS X Mavericks? I found the manual on iBooks but that's as far as I can get right now.  <answer132655> You can write iOS apps with Swift in Xcode 6 Beta. Go to the Apple Dev center to get the newest Xcode. I would keep my stable version of Xcode installed as the beta may be a little buggy, but it will get you started till a stable version gets release which will probably this fall.  <answer132682> To code using Swift you'll need Xcode 6.   Xcode 6 beta is compatible with Mavericks 10.9.3 and upwards so strongyes/strong it is possible to write Swift code in Mavericks!  strongNB/strong: As of July 11, Xcode 6 beta is available freely on Apple's website.  ul liWhere can I download Xcode (n) Beta?/li /ul  <answer132693> Currently the only way to use Xcode for Swift programming is through the Beta version of Xcode 6. However, in order to download the Beta you must join (or be a member of) the iOS Developer Program or the Mac Developer Program.  <answer146371> The final XCode 6 has released and is available in the App Store. (to be precise, I'm talking about codeVersion 6.0.1 (6A317)/code).br I was surprised to see that (in contrast to XCode 6 beta) it does support Swift emonly for iOS!/em (Look at this screenshot, this is what I see when trying to create a Swift playground; also, Swift can be choosed as a language for iOS project, but not for OS X project)    <comment157105> James, I'm going to make some minor edits to this so it doesn't mention pre-release OS X versions but stays true to what you're asking to do. <comment157762> Not only can you, you probably should. If your job is to write code, depending on a beta OS and a beta IDE might be more instability than what you propose here. <comment161005> no sir. it was a friends suggestion hence am tryng to clairfy :D <comment164985> Note that as of July 11, Apple is allowing downloads of the Xcode beta for free;  no requirements other than an email address and EULA agreement. <comment220386> @HarshaMV please provide reference <comment220538> @MaRco85 this was in the first release. not any more. u can now. <comment220615> @HarshaMV please provide asap to correct the answer cause it's against stack overflow policies as not updated. <comment221113> @MaRco85 deleted the comment
