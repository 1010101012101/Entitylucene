local sync of calendar and contacts between android and mac? <body> What is the preferred approach to locally sync (i.e., assume I have no Google account of any kind) the following data between an Android phone and my Macbook?  ul licalendar/li litasks/li liaddress book / contacts/li /ul  I have done some digging online but apparently this is not a common use case. I found some information here, but it looks out of date: http://www.land-of-kain.de/docs/android_sync/  <comment318144> What version of OS X are you using? <comment318219> i'm on a rather old version but i plan to upgrade to Sierra soon (I guess?) -- now that Firefox is sunsetting support for older OS versions, i haven't much choice.
