Native RSS reader which allows to set explizit the status of an article <body> I am looking for a native RSS reader for Mac OS which allows me to mark an article as read or unread explicitly by a short cut. All RSS reader I found mark an article as read immediately after viewing them. So I lose the overview which articles I have read and which not.  <answer93444> I haven't used it, but I think Yoleo might have the ability to do this.  <answer93492> Have you tried  Feedly?  Many options as to marking / keeping Read articles.   Nice on the web too - they have a Safari extension.  <answer94250> Thank you for your answers. After trying different web-based tools and native applications I returned to Thunderbird. Thunderbird supports RSS-Feeds as well and allows you to specify the amount of time you have to view a mail or article until it marks it as read. It also allows you to disable this at all and to mark articles manually as read.  <comment110497> Don't forget to accept your answer as the correct one.
