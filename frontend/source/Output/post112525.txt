Java - version 1.7.45 - and Mavericks <body> Chrome refused to run a java app unless i upgraded to .45, which I did my dling the installer from oracle.  Java 7 u45.  Installer said it worked.  Chrome still won't start java.    precode$ which java /usr/bin/java  $ java -version java version "1.7.0_06" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_06-b24) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.2-b09, mixed mode) ~/private/WDI/git   /code/pre  I may be easily fooled, but that doesn't say "45" anywhere.  (Yes, "06", and "24" and "23.2-b09", but nary a 45.  Such numbers!)  Anybody know if this is u45, or where the installer placed it?  UPDATE: there is a Java System Preference Panel that says "Your system has the recommended version of Java: Java 7 Update 45."  Still, Chrome doesn't appear to see it.  <answer112533> The issue is that Oracle is being confusing abut the JRE.  The OSX JRE, which is what you downloaded, does not update /usr/bin/java it just installs itself to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/   You can either use the path to the java binary beneath that or instead install the JDK from this page which does update /usr/bin/java  @RichTrouton's answer might be correct on what Chrome uses i.e. a 32 bit JRE but this answer explained /usr/bin/java issues. Note that the simple Oracle JRE does not update /usr/bin/java and I think Apple's later installs do not touch this either. Your browser does not use /usr/bin/java but directly looks in /System or /Library  <answer112785> Google Chrome is a 32-bit browser, which prevents it from being able to work with Oracleâ€™s 64-bit Java 7 browser plug-in. If you need to run Java applets inside of Chrome, here's what you'll need to do:  ol liInstall the latest Java 6 from Apple. As of 12-4-2013, that is Java for OS X 2013-005./li liFollow these directions (taken from this Apple KBase article) to remove the Oracle Java 7 browser plug-in and enable the Apple Java 6 browser plug-in:/li /ol  A. Open Terminal, located in the Utilities folder.  B. Enter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:   precodesudo mkdir -p /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled /code/pre  C. Enter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:  precodesudo mv /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/disabled /code/pre  D. Enter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:  precodesudo ln -sf /System/Library/Java/Support/Deploy.bundle/Contents/Resources/JavaPlugin2_NPAPI.plugin /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin  /code/pre  E. To re-enable Java SE 6 Web Start, enter this command, then press the Return or Enter key:  precodesudo ln -sf /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Commands/javaws /usr/bin/javaws /code/pre  Once the Apple Java 6 browser plug-in is in place, quit and relaunch Chrome. On relaunch, try accessing the Java applet in Chrome again.  <answer120879> ul liOpen your Terminal, using java -version gives you an error or Java Version 6./li liGet the SRE dmg at https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp/li liInstall it/li liIn your terminal, type: codeexport JAVA_HOME="/Library/InternetPlug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home"/code/li lijava -version now gives you java version "1.7.0_**" (i.e. newest java version)/li /ul  To make this work every time you boot up terminal type the following line of code into terminal.  precodeecho export JAVA_HOME=\"/Library/Internet Plug- Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  This will make it use java 7 every time you use terminal.

The one marked as correct install Java 6 back onto Mavericks, I believe).  <comment132128> How did you install Java and where did you get it from (the link please asOraclke supplies sever versions) <comment132140> http://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp.  This link is provided by Chrome.  CLicking on "I understand ..." initiates a download of jre-7u45-macosx-x64.dmg <comment140915> My answer does not reinstall Java 6 back. Oracle only provides Java 1.7 (and the SO answer is wrong as the question asks for JDK which is a simple install rather than messing around with links). I would also note my answer is for the /usr/bin/java bit <comment140917> @Mark err, sorry. I wasn't talking about your answer, but the answer marked as correct on the SO site. It also doesn't mess with links, it just redirects the JAVA_HOME variable. But you're right it is somewhat incorrect. Editing my answer now.
