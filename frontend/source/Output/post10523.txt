How do I remove duplicate "Open With" context menu items in Finder.app? <body> For whatever reason, the "Open With" context menu in Finder is strongalways/strong listing every app four times (exactly).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qf5oJ.png" alt="Duplicate &quot;Open With&quot; Options in Finder.app"  I've read about (and tried) rebuilding the Launch Services database to restore the context menu to its initial state, but nothing seems to work. I've also used Onyx.app to clear user and system caches, but I'm still left with four repetitions of each app under the "Open With" service. I have restarted the system a few times just to be sure it was not some temporary corruption of the list.  I'm running OS X 10.6.6 on a 2011 17" MacBook Pro with a fresh install of OS X (i.e. I didn't use Migration Assistant.app or a Time Machine backup). I did, however, sync all my preferences and other files using MobileMe like I always do, so I imagine it's feasible that a preference file somewhere is causing problems? I didn't notice whether this was happening before or after my MobileMe sync.  How can I fix this so one app shows?  <answer10615> Since this problem happens at System Level, I'm not sure if these steps will do any difference.  I assume that, like you've said, you've rebuilt your LaunchDatabase. Just in case:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/khkoi.jpg" alt="Onyx"  You can try the Command Line version of the above (In a terminal):  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  Additionally, Default Apps is a nice and free System Preference pane to control default apps (based upon extension, type, etc.) You can pretty much see and associate everything from there. It should at least give you a hint whether the problem is in the association or the finder is doing something funky.   When did this start happening? Did you install something? I see you have Xcode 4, did you get it from the App Store or you have a Developer Profile and got it via direct download? Was this happening before? Does this happen with every type of file or only some specific ones?  <answer15085> After running codelsregister/code (as mentioned in https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/10615/24322), relaunch the finder. (To do this, do an Option + Right Mouse Click on the Finder icon in the dock, then  select "relaunch".)  <answer69973> I ran into the same problem and thought I'd be smart and run  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  under sudo.  That didn't fix things. It wasn't until I ran it under my user account privileges that the problem was solved.  <answer72891> For a quicker and easy-to-remember way, you can alias the command shown in the top answer into codelscleanup/code like so:  pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"code# Clean up LaunchServices to remove duplicates in the “Open With” menu. alias lscleanup="/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user &amp;&amp; killall Finder"` /code/pre  Add that to your code.aliases/code file (or any other file that runs when you open Terminal) and you won't have to remember that convoluted command ever again.  <answer86994> This worked for me:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/\ LaunchServices.framework/Support/\ lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user killall Finder /code/pre  This is the bare minimum -- no extra commands, mouse clicking, aliases, or third-party applications. I borrowed it from the other answers, but I made it readable in less than 80 columns!  <comment11069> Do you have any other drives (external) connected? Like a Time Machine, a Clone or something? <comment11086> Well, when I'm at work, I do have a Time Machine active, but when I posted this, I didn't have any other drives connected, except my synced iDisk. <comment11113> It's certainly strange, could you please quickly create another user, log in and see if the new user exhibits the same behavior? <comment11120> @Martín Marconcini Yes, I've verified that creating a brand new user account still exhibits this same behavior. <comment11162> Yes, I did try to run that command, several times. It doesn't seem to have any effect. I also looked at Default Apps. Nothing really looked out of the ordinary. This started happening immediately after I got my MacBook Pro less than a week ago. I installed my typical foray of apps, but nothing that isn't mainstream (iWork, Photoshop, etc.). I got Xcode 4 from ADC, not the App Store. It seems to happen for every single file type. <comment11166> @Lucas this is something I have to investigate, especially because it happens on different accounts. Let me get back to you :) <comment11174> Thank you. :) Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide, perhaps even Screen Sharing/SSH access at some point if you want to poke around. <comment11185> @Lucas Yeah, let's hope someone more clever finds something ;) <comment11230> @Lucas The Screen Sharing would be more to satisfy my curiosity ;) But let's continue investigating a few more days. <comment11232> Understood. To your knowledge, is there anything else that controls the display of this context menu? <comment11983> @Lucas Still no luck there? <comment12028> @Martín Marconcini I'm afraid not. I can't think of anything that's making this happen. I seem to recall something like this happening before on a previous system...maybe as the result of installing Parallels Desktop? I did carry over all my preferences via MobileMe, so something there is screwing things up. It has to be a system-level setting that's screwing things up... <comment70567> Thanks. I was having the same problem and your tip was the key to getting the above solution to work. <comment81521> Mountain Lion you can relaunch Finder, at least I couldn't find it with ctrl+opt+click with mouse. All I did was just closing all Finder windows and click on the Finder icon to relaunch. <comment102562> If that doesn't work immediately, relaunch Finder
