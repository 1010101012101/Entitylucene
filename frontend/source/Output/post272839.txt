Slow Wifi After OSX Sierra 10.12.3 Update <body> I recently updated my Macbook Pro 15 Retina (Mid 2014) to Sierra 10.12.3 and my wifi has been extremely slow since.  Running SpeedTest.net I only get 2MB Down / 3MB Up. Other devices on the same wifi network get 60MB Down / 30MB Up which is my regular speed. So I know its not an issue with my wifi router.  Things I tried that did not resolve the problem:  ul liDeleting files from '/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration', rebooting router, then rebooting mac/li liSetting up a custom Wifi Location with Google's 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.8.4 DNS, renewing DHCP lease and setting custom MTU to 1453/li liReset SMC/li liReset PRAM / NVRAM/li liBoot into Safe Mode / Reboot/li liChanging Router channels/li /ul  http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/22/fix-wi-fi-problems-macos-sierra/  Above was the extent of all solutions that I found online - none of which have worked..  What can be done to resolve this? I use this Macbook for work and its usable at these low wifi speeds. Really need some help with this. Thanks in advance!
