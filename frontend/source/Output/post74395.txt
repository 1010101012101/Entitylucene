Ethernet (LAN) connection not working within the Mac Mini Recovery HD <body> my Ethernet (LAN) connection works fine in the Mac Mini. However it doesn't work once I boot into the Recovery HD. Any ideas on why it would work in normal partition but not in Recovery partition?  <comment86395> Have you manually configured any of your ethernet settings? <comment86396> Either it's not set up properly or your Recovery HD OS is missing some drivers. You might check for updates or at least share with the internet the OS you are running and the specific hardware model if you want someone else to test on similar hardware. All we can do now is guess and prod for more details on what you have and what you've tried to isolate this. <comment86508> Cool thanks guys I got it working. I pulled the ethernet out and used wifi instead.
