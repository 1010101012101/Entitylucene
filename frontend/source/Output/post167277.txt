Incorrect Wi-Fi password message <body> I am on iphone 6+ and ios 8.1.2.I keep getting the following error   Incorrect Wi-FI password message for Wi-Fi networks that do not exist . I am not sure why is my phone trying to access these networks if they do not exist of the wifi list and why am I getting this error.   PS: I can connect to the all wi-fi netwoks i want to . It is just these random error messages popping up on my mobile suggesting password is not correct for some "AndroidAP" wifi network that is confusing me.   <comment196127> it will not try to connect to unknown wifi, it will show them but not connect without your permission, remove those from your profile if you have them saved <comment196231> I have not saved any of them . Which is the reason I am surprised that I am getting these prompts <comment196234> now that is surprising, something you have is trying to force you to use wifi you have not used before?
