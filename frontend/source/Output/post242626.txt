Mail Message Panel <body> My mail-list panel usually shows but 5 or 6 previous emails with the message panel below. Was looking for a specific email and dragged the panel bar down to expose more previous emails. I "bumped" the bottom of the window which effectively closed the message panel . Now, I can't get the message panel back??? I move cursor to bottom of window and get the up-arrow-on-a-bar cursor but it doesn't close up the mails-list panel--cmd click, ctrl click, right click, nada. How do I get my message panel back?   Clicking WindowMessage Viewer does nothing. Yes, I use, and prefer, classic layout.  <answer242630> Is that what you are looking for?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/agIO2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Cmd + O or Window  Message Viewer should open a new window.  <comment298536> No, cmd O does nothing. <comment298542> BTW--I'm obviously talking about  classic layout.
