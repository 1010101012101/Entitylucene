Reset wallpaper of 2nd monitor without having connection to 2nd monitor? <body> How can I reset wallpaper on the 2nd monitor without having connection to that 2nd monitor?  <answer211145> You can reset them all by deleting this file  code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/desktoppicture.db/code  Alternatively, you could try opening it in something like SQLite Free - but I'm not sure what the consequences of deleting a single line from the list of wallpapers would be.
