How can I create a bootable Leopard Flash Drive in macOS Sierra? <body> I would like to create a bootable USB flash drive for Leopard. I have a Leopard disc. My mac is running macOS Sierra. I know that you could do this before Disk Utility was redesigned. Is it still possible to do this in Sierra's Disk Utility? In the case it doesn't work, is there a free alternative? Thank you.  <comment332309> What hardware are you running macOS Sierra on? And what hardware is the bootable Leopard USB flash drive for?
