Remotely powering UE Boom 2 from MacBook? <body> The wireless UE Boom 2 can be remotely powered on/off through the UE MEGABOOM iPhone app and that's very useful in some cases.  It would be great to be able to do the same but from a MacBook, but Logitech didn't release such an app for macOS. I believe this should technically be feasible from any device with a Bluetooth 4 + LE device (which my MBP Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014 has).  Would you know how this could be achieved, through a Bluetooth software or script?  h3What I found so far:/h3  This is what my Mac shows for the UE in System Information  Bluetooth  precodeUE MEGABOOM:   Address:          88-C6-26-89-57-B3   Major Type:       Audio   Minor Type:       Headphones   Services:         Headset, Wireless iAP, LWACP, Hands-Free unit   Paired:           Yes   Configured:       Yes   Connected:        No   Manufacturer:     Cambridge Silicon Radio (0x8, 0x307D)   Firmware Version: 0xFFFF   Vendor ID:        0x000A   Product ID:       0xFFFF   Class of Device:  0x04 0x06 0x240418   EDR Supported:    Yes   eSCO Supported:   Yes   SSP Supported:    Yes /code/pre  I've tried LightBlue but it can't show the available services for the UE:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c26pH.png" alt=""  <comment354274> Let's see where this goes to. As long as we are looking at tools/ways accessible to the end user, the question is fine here. If answers tend to require ObjC programming we can migrate it to StackOverflow.
