Mountain Lion: Problem With Permissions <body> I recently tried compiling Textmate 2 now that it's open sourced. Followed all the directions hereand downloaded all the dependencies. Now, when I tried to build (using ./configure &amp;&amp; ninja) I received the following error:   precodemake: *** [/Users/~/build/TextMate/Frameworks/SoftwareUpdate/fixtures/secret.pem] Error 1  [6/1169] Copy ‘"Frameworks/OakFoundation/src/NSString Additions.h"’…ninja: ERROR: mkdir(/Users/~/build/TextMate/include/OakFoundation): Permission denied  ninja: build stopped: . /code/pre  Now, I figured that maybe Mountain Lion messed with permissions, so I gave it the ol' sudo try. I still receive a similar error -   precoderm /Users/jlvillalobos/build/TextMate/Frameworks/SoftwareUpdate/fixtures/secret.pem [7/1169] Compile ‘Frameworks/scope/src/match.cc’…ninja: ERROR: mkdir(/Users/jlvillalobos/build/TextMate/Frameworks/scope): Permission denied /code/pre  Now, I'm pretty stuck. I tried just checking my bash profile and I get a permission denied error on that too! I've ran "repair permissions" in disk utility for posterity and getting the same error. Anyone run into similar issues?  <answer101265> When you're installing unix applications on MacOSX the installer needs to to be run as root.  Try typing  precode./configure &amp;&amp; sudo ninja /code/pre  or just  precodesudo ninja /code/pre  given that you've already run configure.  All going well you should be prompted for your password (it won't print asterisks, just type the passowrd and press return.)  If this doesn't work it's probably because you don't have root enabled. Follow the instructions here to do that, then retry.  <answer105052> Looking at the first error message from make it seems as if the paths got configured wrongly by codeconfigure/code. So just rerun it and make sure to specify any required paths in full (without ~).   <answer127343> First thing: emNever/em codeconfigure/code or codemake/code as coderoot/code, unless there is a very specific reason.  Second thing: In codemake: *** [/Users/~/build/TextMate/Frameworks/SoftwareUpdate/fixtures/secret.pem] Error 1/code: This code/Users/~//code looks HORRIBLY WRONG!  To change the ownership of the files back to you run  precodesudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/build/TextMate /code/pre  Now do a   precodemake clean &amp;&amp; ./configure &amp;&amp; make all &amp;&amp; sudo make install /code/pre  (codemake install/code is such an exception when you MIGHT want to use codesudo/code.)  <comment72824> Where did you download the sources to (into which folder)? Did you set `builddir` manually? What is the output of `ls -al ~/.bashrc` and `id -a`?
