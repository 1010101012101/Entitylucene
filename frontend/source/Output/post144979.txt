Forward email on without opening <body> How to forward email without opening it.  I am getting scam emails and do not want to open but forward onto report it.  <answer145043> I think you mean "bouncing" and this is available in certain email applications, but AFAIK, the number is few.  If you're a command line junkie (likely not) then Mutt and Alpine both have bounce capabilities.  Apparently Sylpheed/Claws also has that feature, although from memory, it's a bit difficult to locate initially.  Outlook for the Mac? Yeah, I read somewhere that it's possible, but never chased down the method.  That's as far as I can help you. Hopefully it points you in the right direction.  <answer145203> If you disable showing images in the Settings app (strongMail, Contacts, Calendars  Load Remote Images/strong) then the sender will have no way to tell that you looked at the email.   So, make sure you turn that on, then open the email and forward it. You can turn the option back on again when you are finished.  <answer145204> Once email is in your inbox it is still harmless until you open a attachment or click on a link in it.  There is a setting in Mail- preferences- composing- Responding to prevent attachments been forwarded, and only forward the selected text.  Check the "Include Selected Text..."  You basically have to select the text in the email and then use the forward.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/evTYC.jpg" alt="forward"  <comment170865> I don't think OP is referring to bouncing, but rather 'forward on[ ]to report it'
