I can find nothing current, from Apple, about emeither/em the absence emor/em the presence of support for permanent version storage in its most recent Server product for Mac OS X.   Has macOS Server gained support for permanent version storage?   Or is there simply no current support document about the absence of support?   <comment338602> The support article is specifically talking about lack of permanent version storage on network connected drives. All local HFS+ drives support permanent version storage (according to your link).
