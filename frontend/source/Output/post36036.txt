How do I transmit video from my iMac wirelessly? <body> What would be a good option if I were to transmit any video (DVD, AVI, MOV, just anything) from my iMac to a TV or beamer over the air? 1080p would be nice but is not a requirement. Setup should be simple and the required hardware should be small and have decent design that can be used in a living room.  <answer36037> How about an Apple TV ($99) and Airflick (free), over WiFi?  It'll only be 720p, though.  http://ericasadun.com/ftp/AirPlay/  There are a number of solutions for transmitting high-definition video: https://www.google.com/search?q=1080p+wireless  ...but to be honest, they cost nearly as much (or more) than an AppleTV, which gets you emway/em more functionality.  Unless you have an enormous TV and top-notch content, you're going to be very hard-pressed to tell the difference.  <answer36083> You could use DLNA if your TV supports it and a DLNA server on your iMac to expose the videos you want to stream.  <answer48523> With the advent of OS X Mountain Lion, you can now use an Apple TV ($99) and Airplay Mirroring to mirror your display (in full 1080p) to the Apple TV.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjHWs.png" alt="Airplay mirroring with OS X Mountain Lion"  <comment59694> For Lion, you can use AirParrot. <comment231682> I know this is old, but [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/download/) (n√©e [XBMC](http://kodi.tv/introducing-kodi-14/)) can expose your videos over DLNA.  I think the DLNA protocol is essentially "broadcast AVIs only", so there is some translation being done on the mac.
