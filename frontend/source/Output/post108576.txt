Does Windows or Linux have any tools for accessing a FileVault2 encrypted drive's contents? <body> I'm looking to mount (and access files on) my FileVault2 encrypted drive on a non-OS X box, and am wondering if anyone has done this with Windows or Linux.    <answer118258> On Linux, the libfvde project aims to support decoding FileVault2. Yogesh Khatri wrote an overview article where he suggests starting with libfvde's wiki.  On Windows, the company Passware claim support for decrypting FileVault2 drives as part of Passware Kit Forensic 13.1. A CNet article mentions the software and highlights the feature in an included screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tMX4l.png" alt="Passware Kit Forensic"  <comment127271> There is this project on Google Code : https://code.google.com/p/libfvde/ But some how I can't find the sources anymore. <comment127283> I see there is a less than visible "external download" link on that page (bottom of left column) with the source code: https://googledrive.com/host/0B3fBvzttpiiSLUVJYl9XRWhKSjg/  -- I emailed the developer to inquire about status of project, so will reply back if he says anything
