Looking for simple app (or other solution) to lookup from a csv on iPhone <body> I have a CSV file with 3 fields on each line,  X, Y and Z. I'm looking for a nice simple way be able to search X or Y which will show Z in the result.  So the user can just type a code into either X or Y search field and it will return Z. Don't have a iPhone myself, but I'm guessing some spreadsheet app will do the job, but might be over kill.  strongUpdate/strong  I have been looking to do this in a HTML file (with javascript build in).  Which seems to work with android, but having problem getting the html file to open with safari, googling it, it seems to be a problem!
