Can't post via notification center <body> I have integrated both twitter and facebook account to my macbook-pro. I am getting notifications perfectly. The only problem I have is that I can't post via notification center. There're 2 buttons codeClick to post/code, one each for twitter and facebook, which used to work fine previously. Now suddenly they stopped responding. When I click on them nothing happens. I can see click animation(pushing of button), but it does nothing, no edit area to post my updates, nothing at all.    How can I get the functionality back?  <answer74611> Have you tried to remove and re-set the integration?  ol liGo to emSystem Preferences/em  emMail, Contacts &amp; Calendars/em /li liSelect your Facebook account on the left/li liPress the button code-/code/li /ol  The same for twitter.  <answer74974> First, try to repair permissions.  If that doesn’t work, try installing the latest combo update again. This will most likely fix your issue.  If even that doesn’t solve the problem, reinstall OS X and then install the latest update strongwithout removing your current installation/strong. Just install it on top of the current installation. You won’t have to mess with backing up/restoring and you will fix all issues.  <answer84537> Download the combo update from ... http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1581  Don't forget the supplemental update too ... http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1600  NOTE: As a rule, I never use Software Update for OS updates. I find manually downloading and installing the Combo Update (not the incremental one) .. eliminates a lot of headaches.  <answer93435> Solved following this guide. You simply have to kill the notification center process.  http://n8henrie.com/2012/08/fix-click-to-tweet-in-mountain-lion-notification-center/  <comment86623> Have you tried removing and resetting the integrazion? <comment86640> Thanks for responding. How do I remove it, by disabling it in notification center or is there any other way? <comment86803> Tried that, didn't work. Same problem. The click doesn't do anything. <comment87132> Well I've installed the combo update, but nothing changed. I don't know how can I repair permissions. Reinstalling a complete OS just for a minor bug, doesn't seem right to me. <comment87145> Google “how to repair permissions”. And did you install the combo update **again**? <comment87278> repaired the permissions, still the same issue persists. And yeah I've reinstalled it the update. <comment87351> Create a new test user and see if the problem persists. If not, reset your home directory permissions and ACLs (Google how to do that). If yes, then a reinstall of OS X is the only option.
