Returning to simple pop-up characters panel? <body> One of my favorite new Mavs features is the pop-up characters panel.  Its operation is detailed here. It is summoned via kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdspace/kbd and looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JzSny.png" alt="pop-up characters panel"  At some point, however, the key combination started summoning the full Character Viewer instead:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yCv3E.png" alt="Character Viewer window"  The latter is a bit more awkward to use than the panel was.  How did I get set this way and how I can get back to using the pop-up panel?  <answer108693> The button in the upper-right corner of Character Viewer was the culprit.  If I summon Character Viewer and click it, Character Viewer shrinks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ccltx.png" alt="smaller Character Viewer"  From then on, further presses of kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdspace/kbd summon the pop-up panel instead.  As to how I got to the full Character Viewer, opening Character Viewer from the menu bar Input menu (which can be turned on in System Preferences  Keyboard  Input Sources):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6rzV4.png" alt="Input menu"  then clicking the button in the upper-right corner of Character Viewer twice—once to shrink the window, once to restore it—appears to set a preference that I'd like the key combination to pop up the full Character Viewer instead of the pop-up.
