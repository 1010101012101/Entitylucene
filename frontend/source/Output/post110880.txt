Trying to remove files listed in file with AppleScript with do shell script call <body> The following code is an example of what I'm using at the moment, but it keeps erroring out on me:  precodedo shell script "find /Applications -name 'Bingo.app' &gt; /tmp/remove_files" with administrator privileges if exists "/tmp_malware_alternate" then     do shell script ("for i in `cat /tmp/remove_files`; do rm -rf $i") with administrator privileges     do shell script "rm -rf /tmp/remove_files" with administrator privileges end if /code/pre  It's supposed to find the existence of a file em(in this case, codeBingo.app/code)/em and write it to a temporary file em(/tmp/remove_files)/em, which it does, and then check to see if the temporary file was written. If it was, it will look into that temporary file, and delete each file em(specified by codei/code)/em in the temporary file listing, then remove the temporary file itself.  Instead, all it ever does is return an error:  precode/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file /code/pre  or  precodeerror "/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file" number 2 /code/pre  What am I missing in this?  <answer110895> You need to close the codefor/code loop:  precodedo shell script ("for i in \`cat /tmp/remove_files\`; do rm -rf $i") with administrator privileges /code/pre  should be:  precodedo shell script ("for i in \`cat /tmp/remove_files\`; do rm -rf $i; done") with administrator privileges /code/pre  <comment130600> Oh, I didn't think of it that way. I will check this when I get home tonight. <comment130737> This worked perfectly. Thank you. <comment130777> These AppleScript commands are incorrect. They have antislashes, which are not present in the question of @Danijel.
