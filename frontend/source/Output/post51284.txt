XBMC green lines on 10.7.4 <body> After upgrade my system to 10.7.4, the XBMC Eden (latest version) shows green lines all over the screen.  Does anybody have this issue?  <answer57859> turning off hardware acceleration (VDVDecoder) seemed to fix it  <comment58683> Have you asked on the [XBMC Mac OS X support forum](http://forum.xbmc.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=56)? You might get better results there. <comment59389> Have you tried changing changing "De-interlace method" from "de-interlace" to "auto select"?
