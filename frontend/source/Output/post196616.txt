Macbook Pro - Issues After Teardown <body> A friend had me do some work on his Macbook Pro 13" 2009. I replaced the keyboard because it was having issues, as well as I re-applied the thermal paste on the CPU &amp; GPU. After I reassembled the machine, I could not get it to boot. It would make it's normal tone, though sit at a blank grey screen. After some trial and error, I disconnected the camera cable and to my surprise the system booted fine (almost). Now neither the trackpad or keyboard work... Please help if you can. Thanks.  <comment234893> This sounds like it will be painful. My guess would be the keyboard cable is not connected properly (probably lose). You'll have to tear the machine apart again and check it. <comment234895> I've tried reinserting all of the cables. I used ESD protection, so I doubt I shocked anything.. <comment234897> If you're positive everything is connected properly, you can try holding command+R to get to recovery mode, so you can see if the keyboard is recognized before boot. After that, it's time to troubleshoot swapping the old keyboard back in, using a new machine, etc.
