I can't reset PRAM (Command, Option, P and R) but it's possible to reset SMC. The keyboard and trackpad appears not to be responsive. At the present, The Mac is running OSX 10.10.3 ./strong/h2  Updates:  @Buscar: There's no external devices that connect to the Mac. I've just created a USB tick using Transmac app, but the Mac doesn't start from the USB tick.  I've ever tried all boot options using key combinations as Apple's guides but the boot options are not able for the Mac as the built in keyboard is not recognized.  I created the USB tick from this guide : Create Bootable USB Drive Yosemite Mac 10.10 With TransMac (Intel &amp; AMD).  @ Typerix,  I've never used Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad Or any external devices before.I bought the Mac one year ago (In US) , It is a MacBook Air 11.6 Early 2014 as the retailer mentioned in the order. Unfortunately, There's no Apple AS or retailer.  I will buy or borrow a USB mouse from my friend to give it a try as your advice. Btw, I can't book to Recovery or from a USB tick.  @Bob : Should I use an external keyboard to try to fix the issue?  @bmike : I will try your advices to see whether an USB mouse works. thanks.  Latest updates:  I used a Magic Mouse and Apple wireless keyboard, now, I can boot to OSX as normal. The internal keyboard and trackpad hasn't still not worked. Hope it is not a hardware issue.  hr  06/22/2015  strongWith a Magic Mouse and Keyboard, I can boot the Mac using all start-up options as well as reset NRAM(PRAM) mentioned in Apple KB. I can reset SMC using built-in key board and MagSafe power adaptor. It doesn't not require an external key board./strong  See the logs or run Apple Diagnostics(boot while holding down D key using an External Keyboard). I see the log as the following error:  Jun 22, 2015, 11:47:23 PM kernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::doSPITransfer NAK received from device Jun 22, 2015, 11:47:23 PM kernel[0]: Error: AppleHSSPIController::doSPITransfer CRC from device was invalid: computed 0x30FF, received 0xFFFF  The recent attempt, I deselected "Put the computer’s hard disk to sleep whenever it’s inactive" both 2 tab in energy saver (system preferences). Then let the Mac to be sleep for a hour. When I restart the Mac again, the built-in keyboard black lights turn on.However, the built-in keyboard and track pad is not responsive. The Mac tried to detect a Bluetooth keyboard. Now, the Bluetooth keyboard is failed to pair with the Mac. Magic Mouse is not able to use too.  Try to pair the Bluetooth keyboard more than 20 times. Then, it is able to use the external keyboard and mouse again.    hr  Look like it is not a hardware issue.

However, the issue is till not resolved.   <answer192453> The graphics are telling you to turn on the Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad associated with the MacBook. Have you ever connected one of these devices to it?   If you haven't, I have to wonder if the internal keyboard and trackpad are not connected somehow. What year is this MacBook? Is it still under warranty?  Unless you can boot to recovery and reinstall OS X, your best bet is likely taking it to an Apple Store. If it's a hardware problem, it is better to let them deal with it.   EDIT: Now that I think about it, both pictures are pointing devices, and you say the trackpad doesn't work. Do you have a USB mouse you could try plugging in? It may be that the trackpad is broken, so OS X is asking you to provide a pointing device.   <answer192464> Since the MacBook Air has a mouse and keyboard connected, something went really wrong with the hardware. You could reset the NVRAM and SMC, but it likely needs hardware diagnostics.   ul liYou might be lucky if you can connect a USB mouse and see if at least the cursor works./li liAlso, boot holding Command R to enter recovery mode. /li /ul  It's a long shot that the above things will get you further, but they are quick and easy to try before you use https://locate.apple.com to find a service tech or call AppleCare for further diagnostics.  <comment228912> Your mouse and keyboard aren't recognized anymore. <comment228913> The mouse is not recognized indeed. <comment228999> This is only tangentially related, but I've never seen a progress bar when booting up before -- why does that happen? <comment229007> @1110101001 It's new in Yosemite. <comment229867> In recent day, internal keyboard backlight turns on when the Mac boots to OSX login screen. Using a Magic Mouse and Bluetooth keyboard I can use the Mac as normal and I'm able to boot to recovery mode. I've not reinstalled OS X yet. I will try to reinstall the OS as the last try before using a service test or go to a Apple AS at this weekend. <comment229870> Without an external keyboard and Magic Mouse. I can do only the following : power button, reset SMC ( power button+shift+control+option and MagSafe power adapter), boot to login screen. The keyboard black lights turn on. <comment229872> I've not got the chance to use any external devices such as Magic Mouse, Bluetooth keyboard and USB keyboard with the Mac before. I will reinstall the OS X to see whether it works before using Apple AS. Look like the Mac is not under warranty as I can't get any information from Apple service plan official page.
