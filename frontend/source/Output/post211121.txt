Bootcamp Failing with Error: "The startup disk cannot be partitioned or restored to a single partition." <body> I have a 21.5" Mid-2010 iMac i3 in which I am trying to install Windows 8 on. When I went into bootcamp, I received the ever so common error of: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nIMCY.png" alt="Bootcamp Error" When I went to the newly designed disk utility, it told me I had one partition. Of course, I knew this couldn't be true, so i went into terminal and typed codediskutil list/code and got:  strongOLD COMMAND OUTPUT, SEE EDIT 2 BELOW/strong  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            498.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s6    4:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s5 /code/pre  Now, I did install an extra Yosemite partition, then deleted it using standard disk utility erase.

If you want to remove codedisk0s3/code then you should first copy the contents of codedisk0s4/code to codedisk0s3/code. This can be down using the command given below.  precodesudo dd if=/dev/disk0s4 of=/dev/disk0s3 bs=16384 /code/pre  You will need to remove the 4th partition. Follow the steps below.  ol liStart your computer from Internet Recovery. Press and hold the Command-Option+R keys immediately after you turn on your Mac and hear the startup sound. Your model is capable of using Internet Recovery, but your firmware may need to be updated. See Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X Internet Recovery.  Note: An alternative would be to startup using the Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6) or earlier DVD./li liFrom the menu bar, open the Terminal application./li liEnter the following commands in the Terminal application window.  precodediskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li /ol  <answer296337> I had a similar problem in my iMac 5K, I was trying to install windows via bootcamp but after trying several times (because of corrupt file), whenever I started the bootcamp I got that error. And also did not appear the partition of the operating system (8gb).  What I did to solve the situation was:  1 - put the windows.iso file in the same location where it was (in my case on the desktop)  2 - open the disk utility and erase the partition "bootcamp"  4 - unmount the partition "bootcamp"  5 - reopen the bootcamp, and do "restore"  3 - I'm not sure if I've formatted it, but if the previous steps doesn't work try this step too. Format the "bootcamp" partition in last option (ExFat I guess).  After having installed windows I discovered that the partition of the operating system was hidden, that is, everything was fine.  I hope you have solved :)  <comment254972> I edited the question <comment255204> Your output from `diskutil` and `gpt` conflict with each other. The 5 and 6 from disk0s6 and disk0s5 need to be indices from the type 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC partitions, but you posted indices of 3 and 4. As far as I know, this is not possible. I don't know, maybe you need to restart the computer and try again. <comment255205> @DavidAnderson I reran the commands and edited the question, and strangely, the recovery partition numbers changed. <comment255214> @BobRon: I edited my answer. <comment255215> @DavidAnderson I don't recommend the dd command. Just mount disk0s3 and disk0s4, cat | grep the product version and if the product version of disk0s3 is non equal to the product version of disk0s2 and disk0s4 and product version of disk0s2=disk0s4 then dd disk0s4 to disk0s3 and then delete disk0s4 with gpt. Otherwise just delete disk0s4. <comment255218> @klanomath: Actually since the size of a Yosemite recovery partition is 1269536 and an El  Captain recover partition is 1269544, I assume both partitions are from Yosemite. No other words, he might as well keep the 3rd one and delete the 4th one. <comment255222> @DavidAnderson On my 10.11 system the rp has also 1269536 blocks. So the size isn't specific. <comment255265> @David Anderson This may be a different question, but when I boot into Internet Recovery, it downloads and then gets stuck on the Apple logo. <comment255266> Never mind, I followed this [this](http://osxdaily.com/2011/06/30/deleting-the-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-recovery-hd-partition/) article and it worked fine.
