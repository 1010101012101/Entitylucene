IOS 6 opens RSS feeds in Podcast app - how do I prevent this? <body> When I click on an RSS feed link in Safari in iOS, instead of opening the RSS page it opens the podcast app, which is not helpful and very annoying. Is there a way to disable this automatic redirect to the podcast app?  <answer183240> Unfortunately, as far as I know (and that is usually enough ;), you can not change the default app that opens the RSS feed. Personally I use the Downcast podcast app, to add the rss feeds from codeSafari/code to my Downcast app is as follows:  ul liGo to the specific website and find you URL/li liPress and hold the rss-link you are interested in/li liChoose codeCopy/code/li liNow go to your RSS app and paste the URL/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5N3Zl.png" alt="Press and hold rss link"  <comment218490> Thanks.  That's about the conclusion I was reaching too.  Even apple's official rss feeds at apple.com/rss behave this way, so it doesn't appear there is a way to indicate in the XML that it's a feed and not a podcast.  Oh well.  Got to work with what you've got.
