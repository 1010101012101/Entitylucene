How do I share all my itunes music with a friend? <body> I would like to share my whole iTunes library with a friend. He also has an ipod so I take it he also has iTunes on his pc ( with his own apple account and Id ). My library is just under 7 gig and I was thinking of using a usb memory stick. Will he be able to add all my music to his existing library, and vice versa?  <answer218856> Assuming you have "Copy files to iTunes Media folder" enabled in your "iTunes Preferences", you can find all all your files under:  precode/Users/yourUserName/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FuBFW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer218877> You could also open itunes, hit Command + A, and drag and drop the songs onto a flash drive.  <comment264610> Legally? ...No. <comment264886> I believe this will only be valid for future imports, to copy all previous imports, if it wasn't on before, do as follows. Choose File  Library  Organize Library, and, in the window that displays, check Consolidate Files, and then click OK.
