New Battery: Runs out at "10% left" <body> I installed a new Apple battery in my MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011) myself (bought the battery new from iFixIt).  Installation worked great, extra 4 hours of battery life - fantastic.  Then I decided to get all smarty-pants and "recalibrate the battery".  I let the battery run empty, and the system entered "deep sleep"/"hibernation" mode as expected.    THEN I broke it when I did an SMC reset, as found here.  Ever since the SMC reset, when my battery meter in the menu bar gets to ~9%, the system completely shuts off without warning.  No hibernation, nothing - complete power off.  Can anyone tell me how to get the system to properly recognize that the battery is almost dead, so it enters deep-sleep as it used to?  Things I've tried: Resetting SMC again, running battery dead and charging back to full.br Battery Charge Cycle counts looks normal; here are possibly relevant specs form system profiler:  strongBattery Info  Charge Information:/strong  precodeFull Charge Capacity (mAh): 5683 Health Information: Cycle Count:    100 Condition:  Normal /code/pre  strongSystem Power Settings  Battery/strong  precodeHibernate Mode: 7 Reduce Brightness:  Yes Standby Delay:  4200 Standby Enabled:    0 /code/pre  <comment259359> Have you tried recalibrating (yet again)? Remember to fully charge the battery, leave it for _at least 2 hours_, discharge it, and leave it in sleep/power down for at _least 5 hours_. Then recharge. <comment259411> I believe so - both times (before & after SMC reset) I drained the battery I left it overnight, and then charged it by leaving it plugged in all day.  I can try again though... <comment259412> Honestly I would write iFixit customer service, explain the issue and see if they can either replace it or offer a definitive fix. <comment260639> Arc, where did you get these 2hr & 5hr times from?  I am doing that procedure right now, just curious about where you found that. Thanks. <comment260939> Tried it yesterday, computer still dies (hard-power off) @ 7%.  It might be my imagination but the % at which it dies *might* be getting lower...   Is there a way to set the percentage at which it hibernates (ie. set it to hibernate at 10%)? <comment261036> Tried it again - to no avail.  Will contact iFixIt next...  Currently considering the script here:  http://tidbits.com/article/9115  to force-hibernate at 10%.
