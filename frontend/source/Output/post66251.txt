Is there free utility to amplify the system volume? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Do you know a simple sound booster app for Mac?br   Skype way too quiet. How to get louder Skype audio output on my MacBook Pro?       I came across this question about tools that amplify sound in OS X, but they're not free.  Are you aware of a free tool that boosts the volume?  <answer66254> You might want to look at Audacity. The link is to the features page. The app is hosted on Sourceforge. (download link).  <answer66313> If you're happy to get your hands dirty and you're a registered Apple Developer, you could use Soundflower to pipe your system audio into AU Lab (search for AU Lab on the ADC Downloads page) and push everything through Apple's own awful AUDynamicsProcessor Audio Unit.  <comment77921> @daviesgeek there aren't any editable settings in Audio Midi Setup. <comment77932> Making Skype louder is a very different question than making all system volume louder. Not a duplicate. Even if some of the answers answer both questions, that doesn't make the question a duplicate. Otherwise, every question that could be answered "reboot your computer" would be a duplicate. <comment78007> Audacity can amplify individual audio files but would be useless for amping up system audio. <comment78049> hmm, well then, why not just plug the system's audio output into an audio amplifier. I have my system piped to my stereo system. I can regulate sound through the receiver. <comment78058> The only reason I can concieve of that you would want to boost system volume is that you're on the build-in speakers (or some little passive speakers) and the only volume control you have — the system-level one — does not go high enough. If post-system amplification was an option, this question would not have been asked.
