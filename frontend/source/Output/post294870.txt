Keyboard shortcut for automatically correcting all misspelled words in a macOS document? <body> In a Mac OS X native textfields, misspelled and typo'd words are underlined with a red squiggle.  Is there a global strongkeyboard shortcut/strong that will correct all of the words in a document with their corrected spellings?  This should work in all native textfields. The solution should not be limited to a single app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2d8Wh.png" alt="misspelled words in macOS document"  It's already possible to Right Click a misspelled word. I'd like a keyboard shortcut to bring up a similar feature, so that I don't have to manually Right Click each word individually.  The feature could correct each word, one-by-one, allowing you to select each correction. Or, it could use the best guess for emall/em misspelled words in the document.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXzWa.png" alt="correcting spelling via Right Click"  <answer294892> You can't correct them in a single click, but you can make it start to go though them in bulk, correcting each on the way.  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd : /kbd [which on a UK keyboard is actually kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd ; /kbd ] will pop up the Spelling &amp; Grammar checker, allowing you to select each error in turn &amp; correct it [or ignore, learn etc]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPfHU.png" alt="enter image description here"  Alternatively ... Edit Menu  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar  <comment372246> Thanks for the answer. Once you're opened this panel with a keyboard shortcut, it unfortunately still needs plenty of mouse clicks to operate. More than the right-click suggestions even. I'm hoping to find something that's automatic or driven entirely by the keyboard...
