Nano editing malfunction <body> I am new to using a Mac. In fact I've been using a mac for exactly 5 days today.  However, I have years of experience using Ubuntu on my PC laptop. On that and many other machines I use the terminal quite comfortably and I use Nano to edit my files.  strongSince I began using Nano in my Mac's terminal, I've noticed an unusual and annoying phenomenal where the for example I am deleting a line of text using the backspace key and the text just gets jumbled and non-sensical./strong A similar thing happens when I type characters. This only seems to happen in Nano - unfortunately, it's the only editor I am currently comfortable with.  strongUPDATE:/strong  In response to the comments below, I am using GNU nano 2.0.9 on a Mac OS X Version 10.7.5 and I am using the terminal native to the system. I have not installed any other.  To further elaborate my point, I was just editing in nano by using the backspace key to delete some alphanumeric characters. Instead of the text to the left of the cursor being cleared away, it was the text to the right that was being cleared.  The code below is from another attempt to edit in nano.  precodeNameVirtualHost *:80 &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerAdmin tester@testsite.tv     DocumentRoot /var/www/testsite     ServerName testsite     ErrorLog//og/error_log     CustomLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log commo &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  In the code above, I meant to edit the line strongErrorLog log/error_log/strong starting with adding a forward slash infront of log. Instead, what nano did was to put 2 forward-slashes in the place where I attempted to type only one, it removed the space before and removed the letter eml/em at the beginning of log.  strongWhy on Earth is it doing this???/strong  Please help me if you are able to.  <comment114126> If you don't get any good answers after a few days, help us help you by adding some more details by editing your question. What version of OS X (and perhaps nano) is running? Are you using a terminal other than Apple's terminal? Can you upload a picture of the jumbled window in case someone has seen it before? <comment114252> I use Nano daily in 10.6, 10.8 and now 10.9 without issue. It would also be helpful to know what your Language & Text settings are (if non English). Also does the issue happen on a new (uncreated) file by starting nano without arguments. lastly do you have a `!/.nanorc` file. if so try starting nano with the `-I` argument to ignore it. <comment114431> What are your locales? <comment114432> So, it `Backspace` behaves like `Delete`? <comment115902> My apologies for not responding to your comments. I was so baffled by this problem that I just learnt how to use VIM and abandon Nano on my Mac - at least for now
