How to set distinct keychain password <body> I find Key chain very confusing, and have had trouble with the disk utility feature for password protecting a folder. You can lock a folder by going into "get info" locking folder by making it a write only drop box, however my password to get into that folder seems to be the same password to log into the macbook, can someone please explain how to make key chain password for a folder when you lock it different than the one for your macbook login?  Might sound simple to most, but i just cant figure it out.  Thanks.  <comment344009> You need to make a .dmg file for this, folder "locking" doesn't provide any such means.
