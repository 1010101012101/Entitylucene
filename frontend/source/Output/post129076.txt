How to delete all music on my iPhone <body> How do I delete all the music on my iPhone.  I tried doing it through iTunes but it says my collection is not managed by iTunes and I don't want to erase and sync because all my apps are nicely backed up and sorted with iTunes.  I have only seen a way of deleting song by song on the phone.  <answer129081> Make sure you really want to delete all the music because they can’t be restored afterwards.  ol liOpen strongGeneral » Usage/strong in strongSettings/strong./li liWait for iOS to load all the apps that take up the storage of your iPhone/iPad./li liFind and select strongMusic/strong from the list./li liYou’ll see strongAll Music/strong in the list.

If I tap on any of them, It says "Item not available - This Item cannot be played"
