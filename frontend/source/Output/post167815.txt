An app that can scan archive files and delete them <body> I'm looking for an app that have this features:  ol liScan all archive files inside a directory (say, Downloads folder)/li liDetermine whether if I have already extracted the archive files or not (inside the directory)/li liIf I have already extracted the archive files, then delete them (archive files). If I'm not extracted them yet, keep it inside the directory/li /ol  Any recommendations?  <answer167824> To automate things like that, I use strongHazel/strong (paid software, 29$).     Hazel watches whatever folders you tell it to, automatically   organizing your files according to the rules you create. It features a   rule interface similar to that of Apple Mail so you should feel right   at home. Have Hazel move files around based on name, date, type, what   site/email address it came from (Safari and Mail only) and much more.   Automatically put your music in your Music folder, movies in Movies.   Keep your downloads off the desktop and put them where they are   supposed to be.   <comment196781> What do you use to 'unzip'? Many apps will delete upon successful completion *edit* including Apple's own Archive Utility. Of the 3rd party freebies, [Stuffit Expander](http://my.smithmicro.com/stuffit-expander-mac.html) springs to mind as nicely configurable in that respect.
