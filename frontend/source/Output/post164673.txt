Use web page as (refreshable) wallpaper in iOS 8 <body> I have a web page where the content changes hourly. I'd like to use this as my iPhone's wallpaper. Is there a way to have the wallpaper update automatically / on a schedule, with the contents of a web page?  I don't want to jailbreak my iPhone to do this.  <answer164674> This is not possible without a jailbreak due to iOS restrictions.
