Navigating forward/backward in Microsoft Word? <body> I have a Word document with internal links (i.e. a link will jump to anchor in the same document). When I click on one of these links, it jumps to that location, as it is supposed to.  How can I get back to the location I was at before I clicked the link? I can't find a back or forward button anywhere.  Also, if I'm in strongOutline/strong view, it changes the view to strongPrint Layout/strong. Is there any way to have the back button also switch the view back to how it was originally? In other words, I'm looking for a way to undo the link click.  I'm using Microsoft Word 2011 (for Mac).  <answer141230> Use Shift + F5 to return to the last edit location in the document  <answer272885> The answer for Windows is to press Alt + LEFT ARROW. Perhaps the Mac has something very similar to the Alt button?  <comment343026> The Alt button is the Option/Alt button on a Mac.  Your answer, though, has to do with Windows, not Mac. <comment343253> Have you tried it on the Mac?
