Run Automator workflow or shell script at application launch/shutdown <body> As the title says, I'm looking for a way to run an Automator workflow (or a shell script) when I launch a specific application. When I shut down the application, I want to run another workflow/shell script. How do I achieve this?   Any help is much appreciated!  <comment254631> The only method I've found for doing this is polling for active applications. You'd think there'd be a way, but I have yet to find one. <comment254641> You could always use a script [saved as an app] to do the launching. It will then wait patiently until it quits before carrying on. [It will show not responding during that time, but does actually work. I use the method on apps that stay open for days sometimes, they still get tidied up at the end, so long as I don't reboot & forget to quit first.
