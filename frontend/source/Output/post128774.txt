Mail.app in Mavericks "updating cache directory" too often <body> it's since Mountain Lion that I've been experiencing problems with Mail.app. I've been using Gmail and I've had problems with badge not being displayed correctly or either IMAP syncing wasn't in real time or mail not arriving at all (while all these problems were not present on my iphone gmail.app).  So tired f Gmail problems and hating it's web interface, I switched to Outlook.com besides creating a new gmail account. After I've managed to configure both, the outlook and new gmail account in Mail.app, downloaded all the mail and figured out that it was working as intended, now it is not. Sometimes Outlook does not receive the new mail while it has been already received on my Mail.app on iphone plus I often see "updating cache directory" in mail's activity window which re-checks all the mail that has been downloaded so far..   What's the problem then? Buggy mavericks mail or....?  <comment150822> Updating Cache is normal and it will happen as frequently as your setting for checking for new mail. <comment150824> It's set to push and not on time interval. <comment150825> Please clarify your question, is it: you have a problem with outlook not receiving email while others do, AND you have a problem with Mail doing the cache update to often ?
