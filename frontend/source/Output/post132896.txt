Macbook Air for a student <body> I'm planning to buy a macbook air for: - presentations (word, excel, powerpoint) - lots of songs and photos (2k or more) - research &amp; social networking sites + youtube (10-15 tabs open) - apps - files and documents - light video editing (3-5 mins of video only)  Will the 4GB RAM and 128 SSD enough for those? Or should I upgrade? What should I upgrade then? Please help I don't want any regrets.  Or should I buy the Macbook Pro instead?  <answer132908> 128GB is way too less if you want to store stuff (like music and pictures) on it. Combining it with video, it is definitely a no-go. You should at least upgrade to 256 GB. About the RAM I am not completely sure. If you can spare the money, it is certainly an upgrade you will notice, but I think it's not necessary.   <comment157350> Tip: 128GB is not much. <comment157353> Personally I would upgrade the RAM and drive space to as much as Apple can provide. (In fact, that's exactly what I did with my MBA... 8GB and 256GB. I'm happy with it for the past 9 months.) <comment157365> Both HDD and Ram are not upgradeable without help from apple so I would spend as much as I am comfortable with on those parts, keep in mind though that there are alternatives to a built in hdd like http://eu.theniftyminidrive.com found here that are way more cost efficient. The macbook air is definitely a solid machine and I don't think you need a pro for what you plan to do with it
