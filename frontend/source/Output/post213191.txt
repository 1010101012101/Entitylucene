Adding deleted Gmail account back to iPad <body> I accidentally deleted one of my Gmail accounts from my iPad.  It is still on my iPhone and my computer, but I can't add it to my list of email accounts because it still exists as my account.    Does anyone know how to make it show up again on my iPad?  Such a silly mistake!br Thanks.  <comment257398> Could you explain what you mean by "it still exists as my account"? <comment257399> I can still access the account on all my devices, but it is not listed as an account under settings-mail-accounts <comment257401> Do you use the Mail app on your iPad, or the Gmail app? <comment257673> I use the mail app on my ipad <comment257674> So you can still access your Gmail account in Mail, even though it's not showing up in Settings? <comment257838> I can access my email, but in the list of my email accounts it is not showing up.
