What software can turn off Wi-Fi automatically when closing lid? <body> I want to turn off my MacBook's Wi-Fi automatically when closing its lid. Is there any software can do this?  I have a battery drain problem.  When Wi-Fi is enabled and I close the lid, my MacBook will periodically wake overnight, draining battery.  I have done ton of research and tried many methods.  Turning off the Wi-Fi before closing the lid is the only way to guarantee that my MacBook will not wake.  But, well, it is annoying to disable Wi-Fi every time.  So I need a script or other software to do this job.    <answer280649> Have you tried your Energy Saver preferences?  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on "Energy Saver"/li liOn the "Battery" tab, make sure "Enable Power Nap while on battery power" is unchecked. That should stop it from checking emails while in sleep mode./li liWhile you're at it, if you don't want it to connect to WiFi at all while sleeping, go to "Power Adapter" and uncheck "Wake for Wi-Fi network access" and "Enable Power Nap" there too./li liTo further save power, you could also (on the Battery tab) check "Put hard disks to sleep when possible". That should help with battery drain - but it's unrelated to WiF-i./li /ol  You may have found and discounted that solution already, but if you let us know what other solutions you've tried, it might help to pin it down.  <answer280651> You could combine DFGKApps's script for turning off Wifi and DssW's Power Manager to run the script on sleep.  The Terminal.app command to disable WiFi appears to be:  precode networksetup -setairportpower en1 off /code/pre  To re-enable WiFi use:  precodenetworksetup -setairportpower en1 on /code/pre  Be sure to test these commands using Terminal.app, as I suspect they may require tweaking depending on your network set up.  Be aware that running a script on sleep does come with limitations. The time available for the script is short and can not be extended.  I am a software engineer involved with Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions about how to use it.  <comment352992> See [this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/2181/88313) for important guidelines that should be followed when asking for a hardware/software recommendation. It will help everyone by preventing unnecessary answers for items that don't fit your request. <comment353003> I have tried all you've suggested, really. Sometime it works, sometime it doesn't. <comment353005> That's exactly what I'm looking for! Thank! I can't upvote your answer as I don't have enough privilege, sorry. <comment353069> I have done further research. Controlplane is a cheaper way to run script on Apple Event.
