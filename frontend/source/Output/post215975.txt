Enter day tasks in Calendar without times <body> I feel constrained when I need to enter start and end time for a task because I know it can take another amount of time than entered.  Can I somehow just make a list of tasks for a day, one after another? I saw all-day tasks, but I don't think these are what I need.  As an alternative, what tasks list could you recommend please?  <answer215978> In Calendar, you can use the all-day events, that are shown one after the other.  Otherwise, you can choose among multiple apps. For free:  ul liThere is the default app strongReminders/strong, that allows you to create lists of events that you can check once completed./li liOne app I really like is strongWunderlist/strong. It has a good layout. It does more or less the same as Reminders, but it has much more functionalities. Obviously, you can sync with other devices./li liYou can also use strongTrello/strong, which is an app for mobile phones and you can use on your Mac through the website. I consider that Trello is very complete but a little trickier./li /ul  Of course there are much more apps. It depends to your personal taste. emDe gustibus/em...   <comment260958> Have you thought about Reminders?
