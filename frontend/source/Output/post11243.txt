Automatically delete a folder daily <body> Is there a way to automatically have a folder deleted every day at 4am?  I'm running 10.6.7.  <answer11244> h2Appplescript &amp; iCal/h2  Open Applescript and enter the following code:  precodetell application "Finder"   delete folder "folder" of home end tell /code/pre  Replacing strongfolder/strong with the folder you want to delete, and save the file.  If the folder you want to delete is outside home directory, (for example the folder /Users) then replace the delete line with:  precodedelete folder "Users" of startup disk /code/pre  Then open iCal and create a new recurring event at the time you want and as an alarm choose strongRun Script/strong and select the applescript you created.  hr  h2Cron/h2  Open Terminal.app and enter:  precodecrontab -e /code/pre  There to the file opened, add the following line  precode0    4       *       *       *       rm -rf /Users/USER/folder /code/pre  replacing strong/Users/USER/folder/strong with the strongfull path/strong of your folder and save the file.  hr  h2Launchd/h2  Create a new text document, and paste the following code:  precoderm -rf /Path/to/Folder /code/pre  Let's call it script.sh  Based on this article, create another new text document and paste the following:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;Recurring Folder Deletion&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;nuc&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;/path/to/script.sh&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;4&lt;/integer&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Debug&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;false/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;AbandonProcessGroup&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Replace strongnuc/strong with your account username, and strong/path/to/script.sh/strong with the full path of the script we created on first step.  Save the file in strong/Library/LaunchDaemons//strong as strongmy_rfd.plist/strong.  Finally, launch Terminal.app and type:  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/my_rfd.plist /code/pre  <answer11356> Hazel is a great app for doing this type of thing.  It's not free, but it works great.  I use it to "Label" or highlight files that are have been downloaded in the last 24 hours, then to delete files from my downloads folder that are more than 7 days old.  I then have it empty my trash once a month.  This is just the basics of what can be done with Hazel, it's cool.  [I have no financial interest in Hazel]  <comment11807> Really nice answer. +1 for giving two explanations. <comment11822> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3030/how-can-i-run-stop-relaunch-an-application-automatically-at-boot-login-some-othe/3047#3047 <comment11846> The folder isn't in my home directory - how can I delete a folder from the root of a hard drive named "Users"? <comment11852> @ryan edited answer to include your request. <comment11896> Considering the unknown future state of cron, It would be wonderful if you would add a launchd method of doing this as well. <comment11901> Thanks - I have Hazel too. I also posted there trying to figure this out: http://bit.ly/dISt3G <comment11925> @vxjasonxv launchd way added! :) <comment11945> Awesome.
