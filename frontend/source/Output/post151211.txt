Disable font anti aliasing in Firefox in OSX? <body> As much searching and trying I have done, I can not disable text anti aliasing in Firefox.  Can someone please show me a screenshot of Firefox in OSX with no text aliasing. Also, how would I achieve this?  Do I need to edit the Firefox source code and call one the the Apple Quartz apis to disable test anti aliasing?  <answer151234> Try doing this:  ul liEdit - Preferences - Advanced panel - General tab - Remove Checkmark from "Use Hardware Acceleration when available"/li liClick Ok/li liRestart FireFox/li /ul  <comment178002> I tried this and the fonts are still anti-aliased.
