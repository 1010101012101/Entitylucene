Can I force GPU rendering on my MBP when connected to a power source? <body> OS X Lion is quite demanding for old Macs. Even though I own a 15'' MBP early 2011 with the 'powerful' Intel HD 3000 for emintegrated/em graphics, some animations just don't feel right (low fps).  This is especially very noticeable with Mission Control: It's strongchoppy/strong.  When ever emdiscrete/em graphics are being used (e.g. QuickTime movie with GPU acceleration, Win7 in VirtualBox...) Mission Control is much smoother and easier on the eye.  h3Question:/h3  ul liIs it possible to force discrete graphics to be used when the MBP is connected to a power source?/li /ul  <answer40425> h1gfxCardStatus (free)/h1  I found the link to it on EveryMac along with some other info about graphics switching.  ul lifast access via menu icon/li liauto/manually switch between discrete and integrated graphics/li lipower source-based switching/li ligrowl support/li liopen source/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7NGU.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5PK6h.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pHvrB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment45690> THIS IS AWESOME! <comment45691> No problem. Glad I could help. And thanks for editing my answer to make it better! :-) <comment45702> This program has helped many get better battery life, better performance and more importantly achieve a more stable system in the case where a specific program has issues (crashes) when the graphics card switches or is one mode over the other. A great tool to have in your toolbox if you like optimizing things. <comment179366> This feature has been removed. <comment234021> This does not appear to work on 10.10
