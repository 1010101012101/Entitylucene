Is there a way to download old GarageBand loops without downloading the app itself? <body> I recently purchased an iPad Pro and have had some fun playing around on the GarageBand app (which I believe is GarageBand 2.1 for iOS). I had an old eMac desktop computer about ten years ago (which had either GarageBand 2 or 3 on it, whichever one came with Mac OS X Tiger) and I used to spend a ton of time messing around on that version of GarageBand. I loved the loops on it in particular, and I've heard that the loops basically carried over with each new GarageBand until around GarageBand 6. But then they released GarageBand 10 (on which I believe the iOS versions are based) and that had all new loops, which aren't bad, but I miss the old loops a lot. There are some funky synth loops in particular which I've been trying to recreate in more advanced DAW's (like FL Studio) but I haven't been able to reproduce them satisfactorily.  Now, if I still had that eMac and upgraded it all the way to Mavericks or something (or honestly just had an Apple computer that could run an iLife DVD that had a sufficiently old version of GarageBand), I could just retrieve the files from that and copy the new loops to my iPad (that part I know how to do already, assuming I could get my hands on the loops in the first place). However, I don't have that eMac anymore; it's long gone. I haven't owned any Apple computers since because they're too expensive and I don't intend to replace my current laptop with one anytime soon.  I'm wondering if there are any downloads or methods by which I could obtain a folder that contains all the loops from an old version of GarageBand, preferably GarageBand 2 because that was the one I used, but I would be fine with GarageBand 6 loops as well because most of them are probably the same. I've searched online, but I've failed to find anything, only being able to find third-party loop downloads which I don't particularly care about.  <comment272564> They used to be 3 separate purchases, individually downloadable , now rolled into one, but only available on the Mac as an in-app purchase. <comment275702> I'm guessing that means there's no way to get the loops on mobile without having a Mac (or knowing someone who does and would buy them for you), then?
