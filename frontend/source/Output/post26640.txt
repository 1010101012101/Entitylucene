Don't require a password when waking <body> Is there a way to emnot/em require a password when I wake my MBA (open the lid)? I'm aware of the security implications. I'm running Lion.  <answer26641> System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy   Uncheck the box "Require Password Immediately"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/im77g.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment30395> Thank you. Boy is my face red -- I knew I was supposed to look for Security but for the life of me I couldn't find it under Sys Prefs.
