Change 'show desktop' keyboard shortcut <body> I can show the desktop in Yosemite using kbdcmd/kbd + kbdF3/kbd  However I would like to change it to something else. I've done this in the past but can't remember how, and can't find anything online for that matter.  Also when I look under System Preferences I see nothing relating to this action?  <answer273825> System Preferences → Mission Control → Show Desktop. Hold down a modifier key to affect which keys are shown.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ef8p4.png" alt=""  You can also see more keyboard shortcut options through System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → Mission Control → Show Desktop.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o8Nsy.png" alt=""
