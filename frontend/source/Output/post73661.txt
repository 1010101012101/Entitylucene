Applescript to quit all active browser processes <body> I am trying to quit all the active browsers using the below code, but am unable to get the list of all active browsers to quit.  precodetell application "System Events"      set appList to every process whose visible is true      repeat with thisApp in appList         tell process browser             quit         end tell     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer75306> precodetell application "System Events"     set ProcessList to name of every process     if "Safari" is in ProcessList then         tell application "Safari"             quit         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre  Repeat as needed  <answer75308> Assuming you know what browsers you have installed (and why wouldn't you?), there's no need to bother getting the processes, you can just loop through a list of browsers and send a quit message:  precodeset browserList to {"Safari", "Google Chrome", "Firefox"}  repeat with browser in browserList     tell application browser to quit end repeat /code/pre  Just make sure to edit codebrowserList/code to include only the browsers you have installed, otherwise you'll get an AppleScript prompt asking you to locate the ones you don't.
