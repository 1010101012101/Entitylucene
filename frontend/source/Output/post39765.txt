Is there a way to spellcheck the word under the cursor with a keyboard shortcut? <body> Basically, is there any way to trigger the native OS X spellcheck context menu using a keyboard shortcut. I know the command keys kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbd:/kbd activates spellcheck, but what I'm trying to do is get the result of a right-click without taking my hands off the keyboard. Is there an OS X equivalent to emacs' flyspell-correct-word-before-point command.  <answer39793> If you're on Lion, you can turn on iOS-style spelling corrections in emSystem Preferences/em under emLanguage and Text/em. I don't always have luck noticing or reacting to these corrections while typing, but moving back over the misspelled word with your cursor will bring up the iOS-style popup and you can select the correct spelling with the down arrow and Return.  A similar question was asked on superuser, see Keyboard Shortcut to Right Click. To paraphrase that answer here:   ul liUse kbdCmd/kbd kbd:/kbd to activate spellcheck/li liFocus the floating window with kbdCtrl/kbd kbdF6/kbd. (You need "Full Keyboard Access" shortcuts enabled in emSystem Preferences/em. And unfortunately for me while typing this, kbdCtrl/kbd kbdF6/kbd is already used by the Stack Exchange editor.)/li liUse Tab and Arrows to navigate and select the right spelling /li liUse Escape to dismiss the floating window/li /ul  You can also "Activate Mouse Keys", but I find that solution unsatisfying.   <answer259432> Everyone makes this so complicated! all you have to do is click and hold control and command and the click the word. and the suggestion words pop up  <comment44937> I don't know of a way to get spellcheck, but pressing Control-Command-D will show you the definition of the word under the cursor or by the insertion point. If you don't get a result, then your word is most likely misspelled (it doesn't provide hints though). <comment324580> Did you read the question?  He wants a way to do it without the need to click.
