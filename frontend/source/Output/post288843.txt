iPhone 6S Onscreen Keyboard won't come up when connected to Bluetooth device (Audio) <body> I've had a bluetooth keyboard connected to my phone at work just to see if it'd would. This was a Bluetooth Mac Keyboard.  I've unpaired/disconnected the keyboard and clicked codeForget this device/code.   However, everytime my phone connects to my cars bluetooth for audio, the keyboard won't show up.  I believe it somehow thinks it might be that keyboard....?  I can restart it (and connect it to the car) real quick and it'll work but having to restart your phone everytime you get in the car is kind of annoying.  I've also checked the codeKeyboards/code in settings but nothing looks suspicious. Just 2 emstandard/em Apple Language keyboards.
