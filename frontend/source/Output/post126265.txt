iPhone stuck at Apple bootup after attempted evasi0n deletion <body> I have an iPhone  5c, I have it jailbroken, and I was trying to take it off. So, stupidly, I went into iFile and started  deleting anything I saw about evasi0n, Cydia, or any tweaks I had installed.  I'm guessing it was a big mistake, because now my iPhone:   A. Is stuck at the bootup and   B. Won't connect to a computer.   Could anyone please help?   <answer126269> Put your device into DFU mode following these instructions:  ol liConnect the iPhone to your computer and open iTunes/li liHold the power and home buttons for ten seconds/li liRelease the power button but keep on holding the power button/li liiTunes should pop up saying that it detected an iPhone in Recovery Mode. At this point, the screen should be black. If you see anything, start over/li liRestore the iPhone/li /ol  You should never delete jailbreak files. They are essential to your device. The only official way to remove your jailbreak is to backup files and then restore.  <comment147857> Can you put your device in Recovery Mode? <comment147863> DFU is not Recovery Mode, these 2 are different! <comment147865> I know. DFU mode just has more options once you enter it. <comment147926> iTunes always says recovery mode. I suggest you read here from more info: http://www.tuaw.com/2011/05/25/iphone-101-what-is-dfu-mode-and-whats-the-difference-from-rec/ <comment148353> For your information, and for others that might end up here, there isn't a safe way to hot-remove a jailbreak like that. The only safe way is to restore it in iTunes.
