Yosemite bluetooth headset not saved in devices list <body> I have paired my Macbook Pro running Yosemite with Bose Soundlink OE bluetooth headset. Once after I restart the mac, I need to re-pair the bluetooth headset. Mac wouldn't save it in the list of the devices like it shows my bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  I have opened codecom.apple.Bluetooth.plist/code and checked the list, the headphone is listed in the codeDeviceCache/code. The keyboard and mouse are listed under the codePairedDevices/code. However the headset is listed in codeDaemonNoRoleSwitchDeviceList/code section.   Any idea what can be done to get it working so that the mac connects to my headset automatically after restart ?  --Update-- Realised that the device is remembered if I just logout and login. This problem occurs only during restart.
