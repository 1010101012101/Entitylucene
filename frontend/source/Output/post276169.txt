Deleting all files except some from a folder using applescript <body> I am trying to write an Apple script to delete all the contents of a folder except one file (stage.txt). This is the script I've written:  precodetell application "System Events"     if exists folder "~/Library/Application Support/ABC/CS" then         delete (every item of folder "~/Library/Application Support/ABC/CS" whose name is not "stage.txt")     end if end tell /code/pre  But I am getting the following error: "System Events got an error: AppleEvent handler failed." number -10000   Please help.  PS: If anyone knows any good tutorial to get started on Apple Script, kindly comment that as well. Thanks!
