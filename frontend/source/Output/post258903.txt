Restructured directory, did I miss any files? <body> I just restructured my filing system of 500GB of data and over 10K files. I have the original on an external drive. Before I replace the backup is there an easy way to see if I missed any files? Obviously diff won't do it. I suppose I could generate a list of all files from each main folder then sort and diff them, is there anything easier?  <comment323752> If I had to replicate a 10,000 file 500 GB datastore to another location I'd probably use `rsync` in archive mode and use checksum to be sure. Then I'd know it was replicated correctly. <comment323768> You didn't mention **how** you restructured your filing system. <comment323774> This was a library of pdfs I inherited. I reorganized them into a meaningful structure, manually moving folders and individual files to where they belonged. I ended up with an organized library but have no way to verify that I didn't lose any files. I have both the old and the new libraries still, don't want to delete the old one until I'm sure I have it all.
