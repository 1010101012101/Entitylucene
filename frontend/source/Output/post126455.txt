Is $HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist still used in OS X 10.9.2 for setting global environment variables? <body> Is code$HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code still recognized/used in OS X 10.9.2 for setting global environment variables?  Apple's official documentation does not say explicitly it's deprecated, AFACT:  https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPRuntimeConfig/Articles/EnvironmentVars.html  Some discussion threads claims it is no longer supported since 10.8:  How to set system-wide environment variables on OS X Mavericks  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/603785/environment-variables-in-mac-os-x/4567308#4567308   What to believe?    My experiments seem to indicate that it is not supported in 10.9.2, but I'm not sure, as I'm not familiar with code.plist/code files etc. I'm trying to set codeJAVA_HOME/code permanently and globally for applications started by double clicking /Applications/XXX.app.  I have  precode$ more $HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist {         "JAVA_HOME" = "/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home"; } /code/pre  which is edited by codeopen $HOME/.MacOSX/environment.plist/code and following the GUI.  <answer140546> You can yourself ensure that this file isn't anymore used with a command as simple as codels/code.  Just end your actual session, and connect back. Open codeTerminal/code or codexterm/code. Run the following command:  pre $ cd ~/.MacOSX $ ls -luT environment.plist $ /pre  The output of this command will display you when this file was last opened for reading. If it was opened by any process during your session start, you should see it thanks to the codeu/code option.  To learn more about the investigation possibilities of codels/code just run:  pre $ man ls /pre  BTW, your codeenvironment.plist/code file doesn't use the right syntax. But this doesn't matter.
