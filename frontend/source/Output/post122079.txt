Does iOS 5 have a SSL security bug that got patched on iOS 6/7? <body> Apple released iOS 7.0.6 and 6.1.6 to patch a specific SSL/TLS security bug.   I can't find anything official about iOS 5. Does iOS 5 have the same bug?  Please cite your answer.   <answer122080> You can visit gotofail.com from Safari in iOS 5 and check yourself.  <answer122082> ZDNet says :     iOS 5 and Mac OS X 10.8 never had the bug   <answer122103> Same manual test with gotofail.com  ul liiOS 4.1 = Safe/li liiOS 5.1.1 = Safe/li liiOS 6.1.3 = Vulnerable/li liiOS 7.0.4 + (SSLPatch) = Safe :)/li /ul  According to SSLPatch you are vulnerable from iOS 6.0 to iOS 6.1.5 and from iOS 7.0 to iOS 7.0.5.  <answer122113> Jeffrey Grossman (@Jeffrey903) found that the bug came in with iOS 6, which means that iOS 5 and earlier builds are not affected:     I have confirmed that the SSL vulnerability was introduced in iOS 6.0. It is not present in 5.1.1 and is in 6.0 (22 Feb 2014 at 5:11 PM)   He tested for the bug on a variety of earlier devices and versions:     Not sure about 7.1 (device at office). So far I’ve tested 2.2, 2.2.1, 3.0, 3.1.3, 4.3.5, 5.1.1, 6.0, 6.1.3, 7.0.4, 7.0.6 (22 Feb 2014 at 5:13 PM)      I tested the iOS SSL vulnerability using http://gotofail.com  on these 16 devices.  (22 Feb 2014 at 6:36PM)   I don’t know if he was the first to spot it, but I’m willing to trust his testing.  <comment142400> Is that site safe to go to? <comment142406> Presumably, yes.  But for an even simpler test, try https://www.imperialviolet.org:1266/ (note the `https` if you type it in manually!)  It doesn't run any JavaScript; it's simply configured with example of a forged SSL certificate and will return plain text explaining the vulnerability if it is indeed present.  See https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html for the details. <comment142496> last statement is somewhat incorrect since 6.1.6 has the fix <comment142509> My bad, now i made it correct. Thanks
