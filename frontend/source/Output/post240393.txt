Ignore global shortcuts when using iTerm <body> I'm using codetmux/code in iTerm2. To resize the codetmux/code panels, I think I'm supposed to press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdb/kbd+kbdArrows/kbd.  For example, if I press kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdb/kbd+kbdDown/kbd, it shows all the windows in the current app, probably because it catches the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdDown/kbd shortcut.  How can I fix this, so when I hold kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdb/kbd+kbdDown/kbd (or another arrow key), the panels will be resized?  <answer240482> The only way to fix this is to turn off or change the global shortcut for kbdCtrl/kbd-kbddown/kbd.  You will find it in System Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts under "Mission Control".
