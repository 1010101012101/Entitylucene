git auto-complete branches with checkout alias <body> There's this neat script to autocomplete git branches.  It works fine with codegit checkout &lt;tab&gt;/code.  But, I want to take it further. I have a checkout alias: codealias co='git co'/code.  How can I make branch autocompletion work using codeco &lt;branch&gt;/code  <answer210619> I have this in my .bashrc which works emokay/em:  precodealias gco="git checkout" __git_complete gco _git_checkout /code/pre  If you open up that emneat script/em you'll see method names like code__git_checkout/code. You can get completion for each of those methods using this method.  Unfortunately, commands like codegit pull/code don't play nice when you try to tab complete the branch name (the second argument), for example given this alias:  precodealias gpl="git pull" __git_complete gpl _git_pull /code/pre  This behavior occurs:  precodegpl origin master       ^      ^  tab ok      doesn't tab /code/pre  <comment254206> Very cool, thanks. I added one for merge as well.
