How can the gutter in TextMate 2 be disabled? <body> Is there a means to disable the gutter in TextMate 2 on OS X? This was apparently possible in previous versions of TextMate.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dLYE9.png" alt="Stupid gutters are stupid"  ul liTextMate version 2.0-beta.8 /li liOS X Yosemite 10.10.5/li /ul  <comment254130> you can still choose to show the line numbers or not (view â€“ show/hide line numbers; alt + cmd + L) <comment254598> Claus, as it says in the screenshot above, I know the line numbers can be disabled. I'm looking to hide the _entire_ gutter, not just the line numbers. Hiding the line numbers does not hide the gutter.
