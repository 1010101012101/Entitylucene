Keeping both files when moving them to a different folder? <body> When I'm moving files to a folder with another set of files named the same, it doesn't give me the "keep both"-option. However when I move the files one by one, I get this option.br Any tips on how I can move large amounts of files and still get the "keep both"-option?  <answer72101> If you hold option, the skip button should turn to keep both at least in 10.8.2.  <comment119389> Thank you! The "hold option" worked perfect for me.
