Backlight of MacBook Pro stays dark under Linux Fedora (OS X OK) after Apple fixed display <body> I have a MacBook Pro (Retina 13'', End of 2013) and I have Fedora Linux installed.  Everything worked fine, until I got "display stains" and the local Apple Store exchanged the display for free.  Afterwards when starting Linux the display backlight does not turn on anymore. In the GRUB start menu everything is fine, but afterwards I can not see anything anymore.  I know it is the backlight because I can look at the display with a flashlight and see (a little bit) the picture I am supposed to see.  OS X works fine!  I tried several Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint) from USB stick.  None works.  What I tried so far:  ul liReset the SMC/li /ul  What could this be? And what can I do?  strongUpdate/strong  Something else I noticed: When plugging in an external monitor, the external monitor works. I can then use the buttons on the keyboard for increasing and decreasing the backlight brightness. There is no visual effect, but when doing:  precodecat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness /code/pre  I notice that the value changes.  <comment304188> Thanks for the idea, unfortantly it does not help. <comment304194> Thanks again. It still does not work :-(. Maybe I should try booting bsd? <comment304195> I did not understand you very well. Do you mean that you can run ubuntu but it is all dark(If you look with a flashlight you can see)? Can you hear something? <comment304196> Give FreeBSD a shot.  I've never had any issues with it on Macs <comment304197> Yes, correct. I can boot and I can plug in an external monitor (which tell me that fedora (not ubuntu) is working). But the laptop-screen stays dark. But when holding a flashlight at the screen, I can see that there is a picture. Sound works. <comment304200> Try running this command on ubuntu: `sudo setpci -s 00:02.0 f4.B=60`It will ask your password. <comment304201> @Nestoraj Thanks! Unfortunately also no luck :-(. <comment304202> Try installing nvidia-bl-dkms from the mantle PPA following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro5-5/Maverick#Package%20Support%20for%20Intel%20Macs <comment304377> @Nestroraj my laptop does not have an nvidia card. So that pakcage does not hell. <comment304817> Nathan, try re-setting your NVRam: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063 <comment304824> @john Thanks for the suggestion, unfortantly it did not help :-( <comment304866> @Nathan Can you do a fresh install of Linux? And could it actually be a hardware problem? <comment304946> This is guesswork on my part, but I suspect the module that was replaced includes the display along with some minor circuit board which Apple has revised since your Mac was built.  OS X drivers will support the revised board as a result of normal updates (or existing flexibility in the drivers).  Linux will likely be using its own set of drivers, and you would need to wait for a Linux developer to update a driver to support the new hardware.  If you explore the Linux developer community (politely), you may be able to influence development of a fix. <comment304954> Can you show the contents of `/etc/default/grub` ? <comment304967> @John It is a fresh install. I tried freebsd, ubuntu and fedora (live cds and installed) <comment304968> @MostafaTorbj√∏rnBerg I will do that as soon as I get home! <comment304969> @DAVincent That sounds reasonable. Do you have a suggestion over which channel I could ask to reach someone who might know if that is the case?
