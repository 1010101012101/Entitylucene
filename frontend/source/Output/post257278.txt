Adding metadata to old photos for best presentation in Photos <body> When taking new photos, iOS automatically sets date/time, lon/lat and other metadata, so the photos are nicely organised into events, trips, periods, etc.  However, when you have old photos without metadata (eg. scanned negatives), they have no metadata, so they will just appear randomly if you transfer then to iOS.  My question is: Which metadata should you apply to make Photos organise them as nicely as if they were taken with a camera phone to begin with? My current list is:  ol liFolder names in the Pictures folder (Note: Subfolder names are ignored!)/li liEXIF Timestamp/li liEXIF Location/li /ol  <comment321220> I do like the humour in the workflow;) - but I do think it's a bit too broad to really be covered well in this type of format. It's the kind of thing that needs a long blog post & several related links... <comment321361> @Tetsujin: See updated version.
