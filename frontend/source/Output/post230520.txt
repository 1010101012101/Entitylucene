How to execute veracrypt on the command line? <body> How can execute veracrypt on the command line in OS X? According to the Veracrypt documentation there should be a command codeveracrypt/code but it was not found.  Any advice ?  <answer230521> The command is code/Applications/VeraCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/VeraCrypt/code  <answer288652> You need to setup a symbolic link named 'veracrypt' to the executable. The following will work in a terminal:  precodemkdir -p ~/bin ; # &lt;&lt;-- if it doesn't exist already ln -s /Applications/VeraCrypt.app/Contents/MacOS/VeraCrypt ~/bin/veracrypt /code/pre  You can then invoke it to get help with (the -t is for text-only mode):  precodePATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" ; # &lt;&lt;-- if not already on your search path veracrypt -t -h /code/pre  <comment328016> Don't know who/why the downvote.
