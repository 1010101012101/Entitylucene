Remove Ubuntu and grow Mac partition <body> I'm new to the whole Mac world, and the first thing I did when I got my MacBook Air 2015 was I installed Ubuntu, but have regretted it now and want to remove it and get my space back into the Mac partition.   I have tried to do it with Disk Utility in OS X, but it just fails and it's not giving any real error code. So I don't know how I can do it?  This is how my partitions looks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q7EvI.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongUpdate/strong  From Recovery Mode:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aAln3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  precode-bash-3.2# sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.10.5 BuildVersion:   14F27 /code/pre  <answer225532> Booted to Internet Recovery Mode you have to remove all non-OS X partitions, modify the partition types of your macOS partitions (but keep their sizes!) and then resize your main volume. The reason why you can't boot your Mac is the bogus partition type (FFFF-FFF....) of your main partition (i=2/sda2). Additionally the Recovery HD partition (i=3/sda3) has the wrong type.  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan). If you boot to a full system and login as admin you have to prepend codesudo/code to execute some commands like codegpt .../code or codenewfs_hfs .../code!/li /ul  strongRemove the Linux Swap and main partition/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utlities-Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code to get an overview/li liRemove the Linux partitions:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 5 /dev/disk0  /code/pre/li /ul  strongModify the OS X partitions (LVG)/strong  Your main partition may either have the type 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (CoreStorage) or 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC (classical OS X partition).

I tried to remove 'what I thought was' the Linux Swap partition in Disk Utility on osx and had no success (before I asked this question), and now when I booted back to osx I got this error: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204156 the "Prohibitory symbol" So I think I'm just gonna drop all and completely reinstall osx <comment273703> Thanks and it works!, just one problem. When I rebooted I got into gnu grub, I just wrote `exit` and it successfully booted into osx and I had all my space back! :D but seems like always when booting it's going to grub first and then I have to write `exit` every time on boot <comment273705> @Jeggy You probably installed grub somewhere (EFI or MBR) hmm. That's probably a second question. <comment273706> yeah, anyway thanks a lot! :D <comment273709> @Jeggy Do you remember where you installed grub? Some internet resources say `fdisk -u /dev/disk0` in Internet Recovery Mode if grub is installed to the MBR - but back up your machine first with Time Machine ;-)
