Tricky way to register @me account <body> I want to register an email address @me.com. Not @icloud.com. It is still possible? Maybe some tricky way? I tried 10.7.2 - before this version is checked @me.com, now does not work. On all of my devices are already iOS 6, so I can't check iOS 5.  <answer66447> Nope. Getting a mobileMe/iCloud email address is handled by Apple from their side. They are no longer supplying code@me.com/code email addresses. Now just go to icloud.com.  <comment78170> No. The email suffixes are handled server side by Apple. They control domain names and are no longer issuing older ones. You get iCloud or nothing. <comment78172> Are you 100% sure? Maybe in a beta version (lion or iOS 5) still work? <comment78173> Yes I am sure. Betas aren't up for discussion here (they are bound to strict NDAs) and it doesn't matter what kind of client you use, Apple does it all server side.
