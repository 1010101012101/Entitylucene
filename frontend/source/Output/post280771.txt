iTunes accidentally deleted on iMac G5 with OS X 10.4.11 - how to install iTunes? <body> I accidentally deleted iTunes on my old iMac G5 running Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11. It is not in the trash, and I would really like to get it back. I tried getting the latest version of iTunes available for my system from https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1056?locale=en_US. When I tried to open the DMG file it gave me, all I got was a notice that said "The following disk images failed to mount: iTunes9.2.1.dmg".  Got any suggestions? I would really like to have iTunes back.  <answer280797> Your downloaded DMG emshould/em work, but assuming you still have the Mac OS X Tiger install DVD you could try the following instead:  ul liInsert the Mac OS X Tiger install DVD/li liWhen Finder opens the Mac OS X Install DVD window, scroll down till you see the emSystem/em folder/li liNavigate to System  Installation  Packages/li liLocate the strongiTunes.pkg/strong and double-click on it/li liThis emshould/em launch the iTunes installer/li liFollow the steps to see if you can install iTunes. /li /ul  Assuming you can, after doing so use the strongApple  Software Update/strong option to update it or launch iTunes and go to strongiTunes  Check for Updates/strong option instead.  <comment353170> Image mounted fine for me; have you tried mounting it on another computer and moving the installer over?
