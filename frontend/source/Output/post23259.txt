Combining multiple small DMGs into one large "virtual" DMG <body> I created 50 small (1GB) encrypted DMGs using DiskUtility, and want to  combine them into a single 50GB "virtual" drive but still have 50 1G  images on disk. How? Why:   ul liI want to encrypt my files (even the filenames) before backing  them up without using half my disk space just for encrypted files. /li liI use an external backup service that'll backup 1G disk imagesbr (files), but not 50G files. The smaller the individual disk images,  the better. /li liI'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so I can't use cryptomfs (plus, I'm  not sure if cryptomfs creates several small files or one large  file). I have MacFUSE installed, so I tried installing cryptomfs anyway, but it failed (both 1.0 DMG and 1.1 pkg file). /li liSince upgrading is neither free nor easy, I'd prefer to avoid it. /li liI've considered other options (eg, a directory of hard links to  the files with encrypted names for the hard links and relying on my  backup service for content encryption), but they get fairly complex. /li /ul  <answer23260> Unfortunately I don't think there's anything that will do exactly what you're looking for. I think your best option is to symlink them all to a location of your choosing, and make an Automator or shell script that mounts/unmounts them all in one go.  <answer23265> If you are on Leopard (OS X 10.5 or above) you can do this by having one encrypted disk image containing all the files.  The dmg to create in DiskUtility is a sparsebundle. This creates one bundle that mounts as a disk to OSX but actually is a directory and all the files in it are of a much smaller size. In Finder select the sparsesbundle and then Show Package Contents.  I just created a sparsebundle of capacity 1TB and copyied a 400GB vieo file onto it. The structure of the bindle had many files none of which were above 9MB  The band size can be controlled see hdiutil. But I have not done or worked out how do do this.  <comment25967> My only options in 10.4.11 are "sparse disk image" and "read/write disk image". As http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_image#Sparse_bundle notes "Mac OS X v10.5 (Leopard) introduced the concept of the sparse bundle." <comment25968> I can keep them all mounted at once, but the problem is always figuring out which one is empty enough for what I'm doing. Ick! <comment25969> Sorry missed that part re the OS - so yes will not work <comment25971> Can't you upgrade the OS? <comment25972> I'm guessing that upgrading is neither free nor easy? <comment25977> Upgrading is easy but not free but possibly cheaper than the time you spend on sorting out the backups etc
