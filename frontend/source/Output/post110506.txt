Downloading videos using iTunes, how can I back them up? <body> I subscribed to these podcasts which are actually vidoes.  I can see that iTunes downloads them locally to my computer, but I am not sure of the location of where they are downloaded.  I want to transfer them to a CD or my other computer, how can I do this? Will iTunes possibly delete these after a while if I don't view them?  <answer110509> By default the files iTunes uses are located in :   precode~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music /code/pre  iTunes does not delete podcast files by it self. You have to do it manually.
