How do I merge the 8 GB of "free space" on Macintosh HD under Logical volume group into Macintosh HD? <body> I did some partitioning using bootcamp 6.0 to install windows that left a 8 GB of free space with cannot be restored normally, How do I get it back?

In your case I recommend:  precodediskutil cs resizeVolume FD192884-33A4-43CB-86A6-9CE4E58B3B92 120128m /code/pre  If you get an error emdisk to small/em (or similar) choose slightly smaller sizes like 120064m or 120000m until you are successful. The final size of the expanded Logical Volume is slightly smaller than the underlying Physical Volume: some space on the PV is required to store CoreStorage meta data.  Example:  Fusion Drive 3.12 TB:  precodecombined PV size:  3120722 MB LV size:           3106192 MB ∆ (PV-LV) size:      14530 MB (= 14.5 GB or 0.47%!) /code/pre  <comment370127> @klanomath i tried `diskutil cs resize and it said iskutil cs resizeVolume /dev/disk0s2 R /dev/disk0s2 does not appear to be a valid Core Storage Logical Volume UUID or disk` <comment370131> @klanomath what do i use in size option <comment370133> @klanomath Thanks! the resize cs worked I used this `diskutil cs resizeVolume lvUUID 0` this resized the lv automatically to maximum/fill-fill,but that was completely random,I didn't actually know what it meant but worked anyway. <comment370137> Do you want to post the solution as the answer to benefit the community for the next person who has this problem? <comment370138> yeah you're right in general sense but when it comes to problem like I had using 0 for the resizing job would be better. What do you reckon? (nonetheless it worked for me) <comment370140> @Trent klanomoath already did that <comment370141> @Anon IIRC the `0` doesn't work in Sierra... <comment370142> didn't know that thanks anyways
