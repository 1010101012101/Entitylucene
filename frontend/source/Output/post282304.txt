Combined Movie File Plays fine in Quicktime but portions of video are black in iTunes <body> I used iMovie to create four DVD-like files. Each video was about 2GB and there were four of them (my iMac would crash whenever I tried to do the whole show as one file).  I then took each of the four files, opened in QuickTime, and used the CTL + A then CTL + C, then CTL + V to paste all data from the second, third and fourth files into the first file - essentially created one large file.  Now, when I open the file in QuickTime, it plays just fine - video and audio. But when I import the same file into my iTunes movie library, the audio plays fine but the video is black for the last 3/4 sections - exactly where the first section ends and the second section begins.  Any thoughts on why this happens and how to fix?
