"low disk space" in iCloud warning while there is 45GB free space <body> I have 45GB free memory space on iCloud:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KzCIPl.png" alt="enter image description here"  but when I try to upload my photos to iCloud, there is a warning: codelow disk space/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AF7uVl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Why? It cannot be uploaded because of the incorrect warning message.  <comment323197> The low disk space message is referring to your device, not iCloud. How much free space you have on your device? <comment323201> @tubedogg you are right... I never thought about it
