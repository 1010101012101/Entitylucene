Tell if screen is original or replacement on iPhone 5 <body> I recently bought a iPhone 5 on eBay. Now I'm suspicious if the screen is the original one or a replacement. Is there a way I can clarify my concernings?  The screen has problems to recognize my touches and sometimes doesn't work at all.  Here are a few pics of the "suspicious-looking" Screen   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fOpq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DA7Wt.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can see the different colors on the screen strongAFTER/strong I cleaned the whole screen with a special display cleaner.  Can someone explain this ?  <answer196510> I am not sure what those marks you are showing are, but I am slightly concerned by the colour of the proximity sensor on the left of the ear piece in photo 1...   Have a look at my previous answer to a similar question: How to check if the screen replacement part for iPhone 5s is an original one?  This might help also.  <answer222611> I know that this is pretty late, but I do think that I have an answer about the discoloration. The iPhone that I bought from Craigslist had similar discoloration around the apple logo, the fingerprint sensor, and the front camera/ear piece. The guy that I bought it from had told me he had kept a screen protector and an otter box on this phone since the day he got it. I put the otter box on, and the only exposed places where the places of discoloration. I can assume that the sun and other light sources caused that discoloration. Your iPhone could have had a case enclosing it, or a screen protector. The sun may have only wore on one area of the screen causing that space to discolor. Your screen is rather thick though.  <comment234662> Are you experiencing problems with the screen? <comment234664> Yeah. Added that <comment234680> I've a 5S, but that glass looks twice as thick as mine. Another clue is that it doesn't finger-mark half as easily as an iPhone 4S or earlier.
