Setting a durable pin-mark in maps by using Siri <body> It's possible saying to Siri: "Show me my current location". Then it opens maps and marks the current position there.   One can then setting a persistent mark by using touch-screen.  Now I ask myself:  Is it possible to set this pin via Siri?   Or more precise: It there a command for saying "Hey Siri. Mark my current position in maps durable!"  <answer243816> I think this is not achievable via Siri, but you can still use Siri and a couple of taps to get what you're asking for.  h1"Hey Siri, where am I?"/h1  All you have to do to strongMark your current location/strong, using Siri, is following these few simple steps:  ol listrongAsk/strong Siri "strongWhere am I?/strong" or similar questions;/li liIt will pop you up a preview of your location in Maps, strongtap/strong on that strongpreview/strong to get into it;/li listrongTap/strong the strongblue circle/strong (which represents you) and strongtap/strong on strongMark my location/strong./li /ol  That's it, if you want to use Siri and a shortcut to get in Maps at your current location, this are the steps to follow.  hr  In case you would prefer to directly strongshare/strong your location, you'll want to follow the same exact steps, except the last one, where you'll have to strongTap/strong on strongShare my location/strong, rather than on Mark my location, and that's it.  Hope this helped you out!
