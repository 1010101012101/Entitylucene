iPhone app for recording spending and sharing data with others <body> I'm looking for an iPhone app to record everyday spending.  I also hope that it can be shared by multiple person, for example, my parents and me could record our own spendings (via different iPhones), but the results are automatically summarized and synced.  If it could be exported out to Excel files that would be even better.  <comment122347> sorry, we have some nastiest in our family giving the negative vote (you got one but I helped) without giving the reason. Since this is pure software question try our other sites. <comment122362> no problem. i'll try superuser forum
