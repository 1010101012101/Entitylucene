OS X Text Replacements sometimes not working? <body> This is a weird problem, I write a lot of different languages on my computer, and since my keyboard doesn't have all the keys in the world, I have made certain key-combinations that replaces them with another letter.  For example, "†˛" becomes "þ" and "∂∂" becomes "ð". Now that works fine, but I have also added "œœ" that emis supposed/em to become "ǫ", but form some reason that special replacement does not work while the others do.  EDIT: To be able to type the ǫ letter I must also press space ("œœ "), while the others work perfectly to write in a word without pressing space.   Is there any reason for this? I'm using the Yosemite 10.10.2, the same problem exists on the 10.0.3 DP.  <answer178483> From what I can test empirically here, the text replace function handles 'letters' differently from 'other characters'.  For instance, I can replace ## with € in the middle of a word, yet I cannot make qq do the same thing, it demands either a space, or for me to click on the confirmation box that springs up.  I'd perhaps suggest as a workaround, use a less letter-like trigger.br If it emdoesn't/em spring a confirmation box, then it will replace mid-word.br !! @@ ££ $$ etc all work just fine.  <comment211309> did you try the add to custom dictionary? <comment211322> Are you talking about the text replacement system in system prefs/keyboard/text? <comment211332> @TomGewecke Yes. <comment211438> Oh, sadly this seems to be the case.. "†˛" and "∂∂" are not letters while "œœ" is.. <comment211439> I like the "œœ" combination becuase it's achieved by pressing "alt + o", and "ǫ" is a form of "o".
