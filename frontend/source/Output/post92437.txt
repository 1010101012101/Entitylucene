Auto close windows that pop up? <body> I have some apps that keep popping up ad windows. I want to find a way to automatically close certain app windows as soon as they appear. On Windows, I normally make a simple app in AutoIt and run it. What are my options on OS X?  <answer92458> You could take a look up AutoIt alternatives on Stack Overflow.  If you're not bound to an App per se, you might also wanna take a look at Apple Script and take away a built-in language you might actually use even in an other Context.  <answer92467> You could save a script like this as a stay open application in AppleScript Editor:  precodeon idle     tell application "TextEdit" to close windows where name contains "Untitled"     return 1 end idle /code/pre  You can open it at login by adding it to login items. codereturn 1/code waits one second before running the idle handler again. codekillall applet/code terminates the process.  Closing windows with System Events:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Preview"     repeat with w in (get windows where title contains "pdf")         click (button 1 of w where description is "close button")     end repeat end tell /code/pre  I use this function to connect to a 3G network:  codemlk() { pkill -x EasyConnect; open -ga Mobiililaajakaista &amp;&amp; sleep 30 &amp;&amp; pkill -x EasyConnect &amp;&amp; osascript -e 'tell application "Safari" to close (tabs of windows where URL is "http://www.elisa.net/slmobi/")' &amp; disown $!; }/code  codeopen -g/code opens the application on the background. Without codedisown/code the shell shows a message like code[1]+  Done/code after the background job finishes. codepkill -x/code is like codekillall/code but it doesn't show an error message if it doesn't match any processes.  <comment108424> Can you be a bit more specific? Which applications are involved here?
