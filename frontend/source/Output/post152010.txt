How to rotate pictures in iOS 8? <body> Updated to iOS 8 some time ago, now I have to rotate a picture and the "rotate" option is gone. Where is the functionality located?  <answer152011> Go to the photo in Photos, tap strongEdit/strong, then tap the strongCrop/strong button to show the strongRotate/strong button.  Tapping the Crop button is what's new here as in iOS 7 this wasn't required.  <comment178868> Note that iOS 8 automatically tries to straighten the image. You may need to tap the reset button first, and then rotate the image. <comment229044> Thanks george, I was searching this button ;)
