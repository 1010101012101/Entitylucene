How to type blank character with Mac keyboard? <body> One can type blank character (no visible output but not kbdSpace/kbd) with kbdAlt/kbd+255 on the numpad.  I want to know how to type blank text in Mac.  <answer108677> kbdAlt/kbd+kbd255/kbd is a non-breakable space (well known as code&amp;nbsp;/code in HTML).   On OS X, you can get it with kbdOption/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd.  <answer180849> Use below keyboard function to create blank or white space characte. Alt+Function+k+i+i  <comment127346> Those are not blanktext but another form of space - what is the end result you need? <comment214927> Not sure what that's meant to achieve - the Fn key is only useful to change the behaviour of F-Keys
