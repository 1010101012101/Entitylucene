How can I cache DNS entries for longer than the DNS server specifies (mac mavericks) <body> My broadband provider is terrible. It forces the use of its own DNS servers, which I have never seen take less than 2 seconds to respond, and often longer.  What I would like to do is cache their responses for longer than the DNS server specifies, which I guess comes in as time to live or something like that?  Is there any way I can override that setting?  Many thanks!  (I know I can add entries to /etc/hosts, but I don't want to do this every time I visit a new site as I visit lots of new sites often)  <answer194456> You can do that by changing your TTL (time-to-live) value.  I am not at my iMac, so I cannot test it out, however, I see no reason why the following wouldn't work:  precodesysctl -w net.inet.ip.ttl=&lt;some integer value here&gt; /code/pre  It's not permanent (setting is lost on reboot), so you would have to add that to your /etc/sysctl file in the format emvariable=value/em.  <comment231962> You router ought to cache DNS itselfâ€¦ & might actually be responsible for the delay. Power-cycle it with at least a minute power off & see if it improves <comment231963> TTL is 'number of hops before being discarded', not an actual 'time'
