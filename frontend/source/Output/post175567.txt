Can I assemble an Apple labeled hard drive in another laptop? <body> A lot of hard drives delivered with Macs come with an Apple logo.   Is it possible to put those drives in other laptops like Asus, Acer, Toshiba etc.?  <answer175577> Those hard drives are OEM-drives build by Seagate, Toshiba or other hard drive manufacturers for Apple.  Usually there should be no problem to put them in other non-Apple laptops if they fit physically.  You won't be able to mount the HFS-volumes on those drives without special file-system drivers like Paragon's HFS+ for Windows in a dual-bay configuration.  There might be rare cases however, where drives with Apple firmware in conjunction with special SATA- or IDE-controllers used in non-Apple laptops might not work reliably. Without knowledge and special hardware it's almost impossible to detect occurring errors (e.g. bit-errors).  <answer175578> A hard drive is a hard drive.br Basically, if the plugs fit, it will work.    With the caveats that...   ul liSATA 2 &amp; 3 run at different maximum speeds, 3GB/s &amp; 6GB/s; in a mixed environment you will run at the slowest speed./li liyou may need to reformat to be able to use the drive in another machine./li liif it's a Fusion drive Windows won't be able to use it as Fusion; it will see it as 2 separate drives./li liThe Mac OS itself, will, of course, not work on a PC./li /ul  <answer175616> if it's a normal hdd, no problem with the caveats mentioned above. If it's a SSD, it'll run, but you might not be able to properly use the garbage collection features of the SSD on e.g. Windows  <comment207085> We should honor each other for posting almost identical answers at the same time! ;-) <comment207087> Duly honoured grin <comment207090> same here broad grin
