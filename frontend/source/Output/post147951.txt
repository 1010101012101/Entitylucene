How to use Messages features since Mavericks/FaceTime <body> So my niece frequently asks my sister/parents to screen share with me so we can make funny faces at each other (using photo-booth-like effects). I also occasionally help my parents by sharing their screen, and let me tell you - having them point their phone at the screen is maddeningly frustrating. I used to do this through iChat, then as a part of Messages.app, but I haven't been able to do these things for awhile now. I usually end up apologizing to my 5 year old niece, but she doesn't understand why I can't do the funny faces anymore, and honestly - I don't fully understand it either. How the heck do you do these things in the current version of Mavericks/Messages? I have an AIM account (using an @me.com email), but when we're both running Messages, the "Ask to share Jane Doe's screen" menu option under the buddies menu is always grayed out. It used to work and everything is still set up the same. I've read that these features were dropped by Apple and that Yosemite will re-introduce them, but is there any way to coax it to work in Mavericks?  <comment174430> I think you have to wait for Yosemite. You can read [this article](http://9to5mac.com/2014/08/19/apple-activates-screen-sharing-over-imessage-accounts-in-latest-yosemite-beta/) from **9to5mac** to see how it works..
