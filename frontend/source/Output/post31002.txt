How do I make my iOS devices use British/Australian/Commonwealth spelling? <body> I have the keyboard set to "British" and my locale is Australia, but neither of these seem to affect the spelling suggestions.  <answer31009> Spelling is determined by the keyboard setting you're using. Go to Settings  General  International  Keyboards, and make sure that English (UK) is added. It also helps to remove the US keyboard so that you don't accidentally get stuck in that.   <comment35664> THANK you! Now I realise it was the "hardware" keyboard I had set to British, and it was an English (UK) software keyboard I had to add. <comment35767> Glad to help. It seems obvious when you know, but it isn't the most intuitive thing.
