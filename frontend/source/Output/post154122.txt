Convert domain account to local account <body> I see this Apple article on converting a local user account to a network user account: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5338  However, I'd like to do it in reverse. I'm comfortable with some of the steps, but for example this I'm not sure what the opposite is:  precodesudo scp -Epr /Users/username root@server.example.com:/Users/username /code/pre  What are the steps required to convert a domain user to a local user on Yosemite?  <answer170473> The instructions below apply in a situation where the user had a "mobile" account that has already been synced to the client machine so that the local home directory contained all the data needed by the user.  ol liLog in the client machine as a local administrator. Make sure the user you are going to change is NOT logged in :-)/li liDo a backup!!! (e.g. by running TimeMachine)/li liFrom the Terminal, execute the codeid &lt;user&gt;/code command, where code&lt;user&gt;/code is the name of the mobile user. Make a note of the User ID and primary group ID numbers. /li liIn System Preferences, delete the mobile account by selecting it and then clicking on the '-' button. Select the "Don't change the home folder" option. This will rename the user's home folder on the client to code/Users/&lt;user&gt;\ (deleted)/code. /li liAdd a new local account. The user name must be code&lt;user&gt;/code. Specify a local password (i.e. not an iCloud one). /li liRight-click on the new local account, "Advanced settings" will be shown. Set the user ID to the previous value. /li liThe new local account now has a new code/Users/&lt;user&gt;/code home directory with the default subdirectories in it. From the terminal as administrator remove this new home directory and rename the old "deleted" home directory as follows:  precodesudo rm -rf /Users/&lt;user&gt; sudo mv /Users/&lt;user&gt;\ (deleted) /Users/&lt;user&gt; /code/pre/li li(Optional): the default group for new users is codeStaff/code, codegid=20/code. You may need to change this if necessary. Use the Directory Utility tool to add/edit local groups./li /ol  <answer275660> Sierra must have changed something because this did not work. The account attempts to log in, then there were a ton of messages asking for the admin password because the Library needed to be repaired. Then there was an error that a valid keychain could not be found (because the account did not have access to any of its own folders.) In the past, an ACL reset would fix that, but that's not possible with Sierra (or at least I haven't found a reliable way to do it.)  What I did instead was:  ol liFrom an admin account, delete the Mobile User account, but do not delete the home folder./li liFrom Terminal, rename the user's home folder to remove the "(Deleted)" tag. You can also rename it to anything you want at this point, such as "johnspartan" instead of "spartanj117"/li liCreate a new local account, using the same name as the account you just edited. Select "Use Existing Folder." (If you don't see the prompt, you mistyped something. Cancel and double-check the previous step.)/li liLog out of the admin account, and log into the newly created account. All should be there, minus the Mobile account tag./li /ol  <answer293062> This script did the trick for me. https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/migrating-ad-mobile-accounts-to-local-user-accounts/  <comment181394> scp is a program used to copy files over ssh. To copy files from the network to your local account, the command would be `sudo scp -Epr root@server.example.com:/Users/username /Users/username` <comment181395> What type of network account, and how is it set up? For instance, is it from an Active Directory domain, Open Directory, some other LDAP, etc? Is it a pure network account, or mobile (i.e. can you log into it even when it's not able to reach the domain servers)? Also, does it have a local home folder (i.e. stored on the client only), network home (stored only on a file server), or synchronized between both? <comment181396> Active Directory. It's supposed to be mobile, but that doesn't work (hence me changing this). I believe it's a local home folder only. <comment361600> This worked perfectly for me in macOS Sierra <comment369736> Welcome to Ask Different!
