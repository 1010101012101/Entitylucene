Restoring window configuration for monitor setups <body> I would like to achieve the same effect as is described in this question, which doesn't seem to have a suitable answer.  I develop on a macbook pro. Often I use it on its own, but sometimes I connect it to an external display (of various sizes).  strongWhen I connect to an external display/strong, all of my applications move to that display as it is plugged in. I then need to move most of them back on to the smaller (built in) display by hand and resize them to the smaller screen: I generally only have my development environment and terminals running on the larger display.  strongWhen I disconnect from the external display/strong, all my Apps move back on to the built in display, but aren't resized.  strongThe behaviour I would like/strong (or a close approximation):  ul liWhen I connect an external display, the OS remembers the window layout from the last time this display was used and restores it./li liWhen I disconnect the display, the OS remembers the layout I had in the disconnected state and restores that./li liWhen I connect a new display, nothing happens. The OS leaves it to me to move windows on to it that I want to be there./li /ul  I note that the OS seems to know connected monitors by name, so it should be possible to have the configuration be specific to the particular monitor that I have plugged in.  If there are no existing Apps that support this, strongI'd love any leads on the  APIs I should be looking at that will let me develop an App to do this/strong.  I'm currently using Mavericks, but I'll probably upgrade to Yosemite fairly soon.  Thanks.  <answer161375> The App "Stay" that I discovered today does this extremely nicely.  Thanks to this answer on the Super User S.E. for the link.  <answer202881> I recommend Display Maid 2. It is the only app that worked for me.
