localhost shortcuts <body> I have php and apache enabled and a folder codetest/code located in my code~/Sites/code. Is there anyway to access it thanks to the address codehttp://test.dev/code instead of codehttp://localhost/~user/test/code ?  <answer31053> This is called a "Virtual Host".  Here's how I set them up:  ul liEdit code/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code, and change  precode# Virtual hosts # Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  to be:  precode# Virtual hosts Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre/li liEdit code/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf/code and add an entry that's something like this:  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     DocumentRoot "/Users/dave/Sites"     ServerName test.dev &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre/li liEdit code/private/etc/hosts/code and add this entry:  precode127.0.0.1 test.dev /code/pre/li liRestart your webserver (I use codesudo apachectl restart/code)/li /ul  There are some example virtual host definitions in the codehttpd-vhost.conf/code file that are there to show you what the syntax looks like.  They look like this:  precode# VirtualHost example: # Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container. # The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not # match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any &lt;VirtualHost&gt; block. # &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;     ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com     DocumentRoot "/usr/docs/dummy-host.example.com"     ServerName dummy-host.example.com     ServerAlias www.dummy-host.example.com     ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/dummy-host.example.com-error_log"     CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/dummy-host.example.com-access_log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Add code#/code signs to the beginning of those lines to comment them out.  hr  An alternative to this is to use an app like VirtualHostX to do this for you ($35).  hr  strongEdit 5 Dec 2011/strong:  Here's a new blog post by the makers of Alfred on how they set this up:  http://preppeller.com/2011/12/04/setting-up-virtual-hosts-on-your-local-os-x-apache/  <comment35642> This doesn't seem to be working... I also tried restarting by unchecking-checking the Web Share in the System Preferences, but it is also not working. <comment35643> @aliouftw Run "`apachectl -S`" in terminal to see if you've misconfigured something <comment35644> it returns [this](http://pastebin.com/WUdk6CvX) <comment35645> @aliouftw updated answer. <comment35646> also not working. `apachectl -S` is now returning [this](http://pastebin.com/KP2Ph2Cq) <comment35647> @aliouftw please post your `httpd-vhosts.conf` and `hosts` files. <comment35648> [httpd-conf](http://pastebin.com/GCaxix66), [hosts](http://pastebin.com/AiU6XcSA) <comment35654> @aliouftw sorry, i'm not sure what the problem is. i set my stack up a long time ago. <comment36099> ok, thanks anyway.
