Mac not going to sleep after iTunes stops playing <body> h2Hardware/Software/h2  ul liMacBook Pro 17" 2009/li liLion 10.7.3/li liiTunes 10.6/li /ul  h2Issue/h2  Unlike a lot of posts on the internet, my Mac actually goes to sleep just fine, usually.  However, if iTunes was playing something, and then I either explicitly stop it playing, or the movie/track/playlist comes to an end, it runs down the battery to zero!  I understand that iTunes doesn't let the Mac go to sleep if it's playing something, but if I explicitly press the stop/pause button, or the media stops playing, shouldn't the Mac go to sleep as per usual?  Anyway I can diagnose/fix this? is it a known issue?  cheers!  <answer47560> Check if really iTunes is causing this by opening a terminal and entering:  precode pmset -g /code/pre  If sleep is prevented by a process its ID is listed, like here:  precode ...  sleep      0 (imposed by 129)  ... /code/pre  Then check which process blocks going to sleep, in this example:  precode ps -A | grep 129     129 ??        37:39.06 /usr/sbin/coreaudiod /code/pre  Then try killing (quitting) the process and check if you can send your computer to sleep, and if iTunes is still working. In this example it would be:  precode sudo kill -3 129 /code/pre  hr  Otherwise you could try re-installing iTunes, and/or repairing your file-premissions in Disk-Utility.  <comment295445> I made a program that can help you with this (slightly).
