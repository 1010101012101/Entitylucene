How to deactivate ALL transitions/fades/motions in iOS 9? <body> Is there a way to deactivate ALL transitions, fade and motions effects throughout the iOS?  When I tap on the Safari app, say, I want to open Safari immediately, not sit through a split-second of fade motions before opening Safari. When rapidly switching between apps this is very aggravating.   I'm already on Reduce Motion and Reduce Transparency. But I want to go beyond this and have no motion whatsoever.   <answer216336> It actually happens on my iphone6S Plus recently, I just turned on "Reduce Motion", and it did disable all the transitions as well as fade, but when I try turned it off and turned back on, it no longer behave like that.  <answer216349> h2Jailbreak Solution/h2  strong1. Speed Intensifier/strong - has tons of options to change  Add Philip Wongâ€™s  repo at: https://pw5a29.github.io/ and add it as a Cydia source.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYpCz.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strong2. NoSlowAnimations/strong - has only few options to change  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lEhGT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  NoSlowAnimations is available in the BigBoss repo on the Cydia store. BigBoss is already available in Cydia as one of the default repos.  <comment257819> AFAIK, this is not possible, unless you jailbreak. <comment257860> If jailbreaking remains the only option: does anyone know more about this, which apps could accomplish this, etc.
