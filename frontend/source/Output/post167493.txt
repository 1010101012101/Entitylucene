Problem with external Monitor, flickering green when using graphics extension cables <body> using Mac Pro first generation  any type of graphics extension cable makes my cinema display have flickering green over the black ares of the screen  if i connect directly to the cinema display the flickering green starts again  none of these cable used to be a problem  and i've tried a new cable since the problem started and this did not solve the problem  if i repeatedly disconnect and reconnect the video cable what i see is that the problem is not there for 1 second (everything displays normally) and then the green flicker kicks in.  and if try for 15 minutes i can sometimes lock in a good picture without the green which will persist at least until the next reboot  <comment196351> Cinema display may be on its last legs, especially if it was purchased with the original Mac Pro. <comment196357> well like i said it works flawlessly if I don't involve any extension cables. but if I try a different monitor the problem persists. <comment196362> not making sense here? how does it work flawlessly? how do you connect it? what type? <comment196370> when i *only* use the builtin cable the comes with the cinema display, all good. when i *add* an extension of any kind or length, i get the green flickers.   also i can't boot into apple hardware test which perhaps is related? sorry if i've been unclear.. <comment196405> Sounds more likely the graphics card is running out of 'push'. How long is the combined cable length? <comment196406> 4 meters but this was never a problem in the past. 4 meters to cinema display plus projector 3 meters away never had an issue. now i can't even get the 4 meter away cinema display thing going. <comment196408> does "push" decline over time?
