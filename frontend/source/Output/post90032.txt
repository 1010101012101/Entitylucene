Linked PDF and going back in OS X Preview <body> When I click on a linked reference in a PDF it jumps to the bibliography at the end of the paper.  Is there an easy way to jump back to the passage I just read?  <answer90033> Have a look at the "Go to" menu and the Back option there.  With a Swiss German keyboard, it's kbdCmd-Ã–/kbd but that won't you help much :-)  <answer90252> Preview can do this, once you have followed a link kbdCmd-[ /kbd will take you "Back" to the page where the link was clicked. Additionally if you wish to follow the link again using your keyboard, the obvious shortcut for "Forward" is then kbdCmd-]/kbd.  Both of these may be found under the "Go" menu in Preview.
