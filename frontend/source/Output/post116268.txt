Loss of audio on MacBook Retina 15" 2013 <body> I have a laptop that's two weeks old. I plugged in my headphones for the first time today, and I had no audio, so I unplugged them and I still had no audio.  I have done the following:  ul liRestart/li liSleep/li liShutdown/li liPlugged in headphones multiple times and turned/li liChecked for foreign objects/li liReset PRAM and SMC/li liRestored from recovery console/li liErased disc and restored new OSX from recovery console/li liChecked audio settings to make sure internal speaker, mute and volume and all ok./li liChecked for light emitting from headphone jack/li liChecked that the micro switches in the jack are no depressed./li /ul  I am looking for more suggestions. I use the laptop for work everyday, so I can't afford to give it to Apple to fix at the moment.  <answer125032> It was a faulty logic board. Had it replaced under warranty and issue resolved.  <comment146345> It's always tough when it's a hardware issue.
