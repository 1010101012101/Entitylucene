What is the difference between on-the-go, save episode and download episode? <body> When using the podcast app, I can view the details about a particular show and am presented with three options that all sound like what I want to do. I want to get the episode now over wifi, and then listen to the episode later with no data connection.  What is the difference between on-the-go, save episode and download episode?  <answer131511> strongOn-The-Go/strong will create a play list which can be found under strongMy Stations / On-The-Go/strong.  strongSave Episode/strong will save an episode that strongyou've already played/strong under the emSaved/em tab.  Doing strongDownload Episode/strong, on the other hand, will actually start to download the episode and move it into emMy Podcasts/em list.  So, while emOn-The-Go/em and emSave Episode/em is a way of emorganizing/em the episodes you've already downloaded, doing emDownload Episode/em actually downloads it.
