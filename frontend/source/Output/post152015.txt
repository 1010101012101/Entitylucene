Yosemite 10.10 long delay when switching apps <body> Whenever I switch apps in Yosemite 10.10 (never having installed the beta on this MacBook Pro), there is a 5 second delay with spinning beachball. I have tried repairing permissions. Are there a series of troubleshooting suggestions? Not sure what to do next...
