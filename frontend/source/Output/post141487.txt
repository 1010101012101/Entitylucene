Paused & want to delete partially downloaded Yosemite <body> I was installing Yosemite Beta, however, I paused the download as I have not backup my Mac. Does anyone know how I can delete the paused download of it? It's driving me nuts! I can't just press "delete" like my other Apps!  <answer141492> Partial downloads are stored in code/private/var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.appstore//code. Delete the partial download from there and reset the Mac App Store from the debug menu if necessary.  <answer145932> In Launchpad, click and hold on the icon for the download, and an 'x' will appear in the upper left-hand corner, clicking the 'x' will delete the download.  <answer151063> Best way to do this is to enable the Debug menu for the App Store. Do this:   ol liRun this command from Terminal:  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true &amp;&amp; killall App\ Store /code/pre/li liGo to the the App Store debug menu and reveal the download folder. You can delete the whole thing from Finder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHCxW.png" width="267"/li liLog out and back in to your Mac./li liEmpty the trash./li /ol  <answer151358> ol liClose App Store/li liIn the Finder search for: com.apple.appstore/li lidelete the whole com.apple.appstore folder/li liempty trash/li lirestart the App Store/li /ol  <answer151840> To delete an active download for Yosemite in the Trash can, I had to switch to Safe Mode (Hold down SHIFT Key while booting) before I could delete it. HTH  <answer161489> There are two simpler ways for this:  ol liIn Mac App Store Updates page, simply hold down kbdoption/kbd, and you'll see the strongPause/strong button changes to strongCancel/strong./li liIn Launchpad, hold down kbdoption/kbd and you'll see apps icons begin to wiggle (just like they would on iOS). Click the strongX/strong that has appeared and the update will be canceled./li /ol  <answer176599> In App Store go to Purchases tab and hold down the option key and you will see the Pause button turns to Cancel, only click on cancel button.   <comment167393> Welcome to Ask Different!

Why negative votes? +1 <comment177876> You are getting negatives because it is confusing to average users. Give step by step with screen shots to help us! <comment182102> Yeah, this is the easiest way.  Go to Launchpad, click and hold on the OS X Yosemite icon, then tap the X that appears.  Easy. <comment201387> Best way to get rid of those insanely large development version that download behind your back. Or anything downloaded from the App Store that matter. Really helps if you have a tiny SSD <comment207300> This seems to be the official procedure. I recommend this instead of manually deleting folders. <comment222073> Yes, this step helped me in Yosemite. http://www.cultofmac.com/224342/cancel-instead-of-pausing-your-mac-app-store-updates-os-x-tips/ <comment327789> Doesn't seem to work in Sierra
