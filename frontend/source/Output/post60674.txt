How to get back the missing monitor option in Mountain Lion's menubar? <body> When plugging in an external monitor on every OS X &lt; 10.8 you could set the monitor options to show up on the menu bar.   How do I get this option on Mountain Lion?  I connect a DVI monitor via the hdmi ouput on a retina MacBook Pro and I am unable to find a way to enable this option.  <answer60691> The menubar option is not available anymore.  You have to go into System Preferences  Displays.  THe fastest way is to use shortcuts:  strongOption(alt) + Brightness Key/strong on an Apple Keyboard brings you directly to the display settings. strongCommand + F1/strong to toggle between video mirroring and extended desktop strongCommand + F2/strong to detect displays    strongControl + Brightness/strong to change the brightness of the secondary display.  <answer61744> SystemLibraryCoreservicesMenu Extras - Double click on the Displays.Menu icon  Just like in the old (10.3?) days.  <answer68292> I did find out that in Display Preferences, if you hold down kbdOption ⌥/kbd you get the detect display. The the other solution of using kbd⌥/kbd + Brightness keys works.  <answer68617> Display Menu (free) on the Mac App store adds the menu options back for OS X 10.8  <comment69855> keyboard shortcut works. Thank you. <comment70840> What I find missing is being able to quickly change the resolution. This is too many steps now and I don't understand what motivation Apple had for removing the menubar icon. <comment71299> this actually gets you the option back in the menubar(even though it is a different symbol) knowing the shortcut is however better in my opinion. <comment71594> The keyboard shortcut is very good... providing you have a newer Apple keyboard. If not, you're out of luck. <comment77225> @AaronBertrand - Change for the sake of change. <comment77772> @CarlosTheBadger I tried your tips but the icon appear for a second and then disappear again. I have a MacBook Pro 2011, and I'm attaching a VGA monitor. <comment190054> Now that it is available through a menu, you could map a shortcut key to it.  Still, a functional menu would actually be useful.  The Displays.menu thing just displays a menu to open the Displays preferences.  Pretty lame, actually.
