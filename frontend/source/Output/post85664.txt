Time Machine backup is 10% of actual disk size <body> I used a brand new external HDD and had time machine do a backup.  My HDD size is 481GB, but the only space used on the external HDD is 40GB.  Under the users directory, I do not see my own folder either.  What should I change so that it will take a full backup?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xEv2.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGu3J.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment98723> Can you add a screenshot of your Time Machine options and especially the excluded directories? <comment98909> @patrix, I have added screenshots of the Options and Excluded directories <comment98912> According to the screenshots 400GB have been used on the TM disk. Why do you think it's only 40? <comment99041> @patrix, it was 1.96 TB left until just before this screenshot.  I see that it is 1.58 TB now (and I missed it when I posted the screenshots.   The reason I am worried is that my personal folder `\Users\MyUserName` could not be found in any of the backups, and so my files, pictures, music, etc was all missing.  I will check this in more detail as soon as I get home.
