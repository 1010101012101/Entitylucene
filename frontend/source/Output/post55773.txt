How do I permanently show my dashboard on a separate monitor? <body> I work in multi monitor setup.  I have some important information available in the dashboard and want it to be always visible on one of the monitor.  Is there a way (w/ external software or not) to do so?  <answer55796> There isn't a built in function to do this. You have to look for an external tool, but i think there will be no such tool, though.
