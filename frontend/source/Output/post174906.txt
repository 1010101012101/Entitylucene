OS X upgrade on MacBook Pro mid 2010 trilemma <body> I'd like to have some feedback from those of you who have experience to share about upgrading OS X on MacBook Pro 15" (mid 2010 - MacBookPro6,2).  I'm running OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard, and I've never needed to upgrade because I use my mac only for software development on the java environment, so I've never needed to stay up to date and I don't even have Apple or Android devices to sync. So, just consider the main use I do of my Mac is about developing on the java platform (ad just for fun).  Now I need to move to Java 7 or maybe Java 8 and I need to upgrade Snow Leopard to one of its successors:  ul liMountain Lion (10.7.3 at least) br //li liMaverick br //li liYosemite br //li /ul  Here's my trilemma: which of the aforementioned OS would better fit my laptop's hardware? According to Apple's official site all of them have the same minimum requirements:  ul li2 GB of RAM br //li li8 GB free HD space/li /ul  Here's an excerpt from the System Profiler running on my laptop (translated from Italian localization):  ul liModel name:  MacBook Probr //li liModel ID:    MacBookPro6,2br //li liProcessor name:  Intel Core i5br //li liCPU speed:   2,4 GHzbr //li liNumber of CPUs:  1br //li liNumber of cores: 2br //li liCache L2 (per core): 256 KBbr //li liCache L3:    3 MBbr //li liRAM: 4 GBbr //li /ul  Please, don't point out the latter are free - I know - just focus on performance.   Personally, I don't feel like upgrading to Yosemite, but I'd rather move to Maverick. This is not based on figures, just on my gut feelings: I suspect that Yosemite may be too demanding about hardware configuration.  What do you think?  <answer174908> The more advanced version, results in most memory consumption system. So, if you are only care about performance, no doubts, Mountain Lion must be your choice.
