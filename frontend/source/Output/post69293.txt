Found bizarre signed exceptions under com.apple.alf.plist <body> In the never-ending quest to track down odd errors on my late 2008 MBP, running 10.6.8, I have recently noticed that I have several code.plist/code files are created anew several times a day. The list varies, and more importantly is not always dependent upon my changing anything.   I codecd/code'd into code/Library/Preferences//code and ran codels -ahilt/code. Turns out that codecom.apple.alf.plist/code is one of the most recently updated, so I checked it out. Nothing too unusual until I get to the codesignexceptions/code key. Underneath are several codecom.blizzard.NAME/code entries. Most of these have games (e.g., WOW) listed underneath. I am not now and have never been a gamer, and wouldn't have come anywhere near a site to download any of these. My questions:    a) WTF?br b) is it safe to just trash code.alf.plist/code and rebuild it from within firewall preferences after I log out/back in?  Cheers
