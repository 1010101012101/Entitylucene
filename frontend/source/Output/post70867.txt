How to zoom in with a mouse? <body> I'm using MBP and external monitor, keyboard and mouse. I'd like to be able to zoom in the text in Safari. Safari keyboard shortcuts for zooming text arekbdCommand/kbd kbd+/kbd/kbd-/kbd. I would like to use kbdCtrl/kbd+scrolling with the mouse. This works in Windows 7 for instance.  Currently, kbdCtrl/kbd+scrolling is zooming the entire screen, not text.  Can I zoom text in Safari using a mouse?   <answer70872> To turn off zooming of the screen go to the emAccessibility/em preference pane ad uncheck the following option under the emZoom/em section:     Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom:   This might release the functionality you wanted.  Unfortunately I cannot test this since I'm using a MBP without a mouse and so I can only use the trackpad pinch zoom (however, I would rarely do that over using the keyboard).  <answer70883> I found partial answer: I'm using BetterTouchTool and using Ctrl+Left/Right mouse button I can zoom in/out text - couldn't find a way to do it via scrolling instead of mouse's buttons.  <answer119542> ul liTo zoom inside safari you can use 2 fingers pinching in the trackpad./li li2 fingers tap will zoom so the text fits the safari window./li liAlso a single finger double tap in the mighty mouse does the same trick. (not double click)/li /ul  If you want even more ways to do stuff with your mouse I know about this software called MagicPrefs that I used for quite some time and loved it. There is also a similar software called BetterTouchTool.  <comment82296> I unchecked it now and it doesn't zoom in Mac-style, but it doesn't zoom-in the text in Safari either.
