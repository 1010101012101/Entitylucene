How to symlink home directory (~) to google drive <body> I know that you can hard link arbitrary directories to google drive, but I was wondering how you would go about doing this if you wanted to mirror your whole home directory. Given that the home directory is the parent of the google drive folder, I can imagine some really wacky loopy behavior if you tried to symlink your home inside your google drive which was inside your home.  My larger question is: how do you mirror your home directory to google drive, but assuming you want to use a symlink, how do you do properly set this up?  <comment318480> Having no experience with G-Drive I'll post this as a comment, but if it allows you to set its location *outside* of your home folder (EG: MacHD/GDrive) then it would be a simple matter. Otherwise I don't believe the file system will allow a nested symlink like that.
