Excel always opens spreadsheet in read-only mode <body> I understand this issue arose over the past 2-3 years, but I haven't seen any solution.  A workbook created on a Windows PC using Office 365 - transferred to Mac (Yosemite installed) - opens in read-only mode in Office 365 for Mac.  The workbook doesn't have a "/" in its name. I made sure there is read/write access for the file and also the folder. It contains macros, some of which work, others will have to be redone.    After saving it with a different name, I may work as usual with it like updating, saving and closing it.  After reopening it, it's again in read-only mode.   After all this time there must be a solution for the problem.  <answer209733> I had the same problem. I could see the attributes set as Read-Only under the preferences but couldn't change them. I completely closed out of excel on my mac and changed the name of the excel file. That seemed to have changed the Read-Only status of my file when I opened it next. Hope this helps.  <comment212358> How was it  transferred? <comment212461> copied to external hard drive then recopied onto Mac. <comment218221> Do a Get any info on the Folder that its in read only format ?? At the bottom do you have Read Only privileges for that folder?   If you do a Get Info on that Excel sheet file, can you change it so you have Read & Write? <comment227602> I have the same problem. I found that the particular file's attributes in the properties checked to the Read-only, but it is kind of locked so cant be changed. You can see the attributes in File-Properties-General. However, I could not find any way to change this attributes.
