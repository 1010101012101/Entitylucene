Verizon iPhone 4 on Straight Talk <body> I have a Verizon iPhone 4 CDMA per specs. Straight Talk now offers CDMA $45 per month unlimited and you can BYOP per Straight Talk website.  If I switch to Straight Talk can I later decide to change to Page Plus or even buy a Verizon package with the same phone?
