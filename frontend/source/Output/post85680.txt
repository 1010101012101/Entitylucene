Smart Mailbox Folder not displaying mail <body> I've got two smart mailboxes named emNEW eric@/em and emNEW ericgorr@/em which contain only new message for corresponding email accounts. I have placed these two smart mailboxes into a smart mailbox folder named emPersonal/em. When I select emPersonal/em, I see that it will show me the new messages contained in the smart mailboxes it contains as shown in the image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xV7fG.png" alt="Working Smart Mailbox Folder"  So far, so good. However, I created another smart mailbox folder called emPersonal 2/em. When I move the smart mailbox emNEW eric@/em into emPersonal 2/em and select emPersonal 2/em, no messages are displayed as shown in the image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RH5lM.png" alt="Not working Smart Mailbox Folder"  Anyone know why? Any know what can be done to fix this?  <answer101712> The update (released today) for Mountain Lion, version 10.8.5, is supposed to, among other things:     Fix an issue that may prevent Mail from displaying messages.   I'd be curious to see, since this issue was never solved, if this update resolves it.
