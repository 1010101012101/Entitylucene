Why does the file size change when you change the "open with" option in Get Info? <body> ul liCreate a strongplain text/strong file with the string codeABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ/code./li liCheck the file size. It is 26 bytes, as expected./li liGo to Get Info, and find the pane labeled "Open with..."/li liIt says "TextEdit" by default./li liChange it to something else. I changed it to "Microsoft Word"./li liBoom. The file is now suddenly 1,364 bytes (8 KB on disk) large./li liNow I will change the box back to "TextEdit"./li liIt stays at 1,364 bytes./li /ul  So my question is, what exactly happened here?  ul liWhy did the file size grow when I changed the program that opens it?/li liAnd why did it not revert when I changed it back to the default? How do I revert it?/li /ul  If you open the file, the string content is intact. So, how exactly are all those extra bytes being used? If OSX says that it is 1kb large, then surely there is 1kb of stuff in it?  OSX Mountain Lion.  <answer124725> Not sure but it emMIGHT/em be the MS Word icon that takes the extra space.  Try this, get info on the file after you have changed it back from an MS Word document.  Click on the icon in the upper left corner  Press COMMAND-X (cut)  close the window  re-open it and see what the size is....  Just spitballing here...
