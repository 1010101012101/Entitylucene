How can I upgrade an old iMac from 10.6.8? <body> precodeModel: iMac11,2 (Core i3-550, MC509LL/A) /code/pre  It was shipped with Snow Leopard 10.6.4, and I managed to update to 10.6.8 via Apple Software Update. After some research I found that this old iMac is capable of running Sierra (10.12.x) and made a few attempts to upgrade.  I noticed that I must first upgrade it to Lion (10.7.5) or El Capitan (10.11.6), both of which are no longer available from the Mac App Store.   But, all info I found from Google tells me to upgrade via MAS. (That's why I'm adding a month in the title.) Any ideas?  <answer286420> You have a couple of options you can try:  ul liDownload  El Capitan from the App Store/li liTake your Mac into an Apple Store where they can download and install El Capitan for you./li /ul  <comment361327> You can try going into an Apple Store where they can download it for you.  Barring that, you can have a friend make a USB installer for you if they have El Cap or Sierra already installed. <comment361328> Try this link to download El Capitan:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 <comment361349> @Allan Finished my work with your link. Thanks.
