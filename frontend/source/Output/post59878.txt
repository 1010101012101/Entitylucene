Better to migrate before upgrade to Lion, or upgrade before migrating? <body> I'm getting a new MacBook Pro, and I am wondering about the relative merits of:  ul liinstalling Mountain Lion on the new laptop before migrating my account from my old MBP; or/li limigrating my account and then upgrading to Mountain Lion/li /ul  Or are the two methods functionally equivalent?  <answer59879> It is best to upgrade and then migrate. Usually problems occur while upgrading, and it is best to upgrade or install from scratch, as opposed to upgrade on a system which might have something incompatible already installed.
