Please guide me on this. Links to articles will be fine.  Thank you.  <answer131736> You cannot do that, because the WiFi card cannot be connected to another WiFi spot as broadcasting his own signal. If you want to become a wireless hotspot, you'll loose connectivity with the internet. Therefor you'll need to be connected to internet with LAN. To do what you want, you'll need an external WiFi card.  <comment154807> I agree with Mathias. A secondary wifi dongle will be needed.
