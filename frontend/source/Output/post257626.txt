OSX Sierra and keychain <body> Have been really pleased with my Mac since leaving Microsoft in the dust. After installing Sierra however I am less pleased. On installation I got a dialogue box which said "you cannot now use your apple ID as a user login" and asked for a new one, which I did. Everything installed well, until I opened Mail and found that no emails could be sent as there was a problem with passwords caused by Keychain issues. The KeyChain did not open normally on logging in and I now have to enter passwords for every email I send. Anyone know what's going on?  <comment321785> Asking if "anyone knows what's going on" might get your question closed.
