MacBook Pro keyboard only works when I log into guest account first <body> I restarted my MacBook Pro several times because the keyboard wasn't working. I couldn't even type my password. The caps lock was responding but with a 20 or more seconds delay. I was able to access my main user account after first logging into the guest account. I decided to logout of the guest account and the keyboard became unresponsive again till I logged into the guest account. I am using El Capitan 10.11.16 on an early 2011 Macbook Pro. What could be the cause?
