Recording direct from camera into MacBook Pro via HDMI? <body> Is there any way to 'tether' my camera via its HDMI out to a MacBook pro?   The goal is to record live, uncompressed, video direct from a camera. Thus skipping the camera's file system and recording directly onto the Mac's hard drive via Premier Pro or similar software.   <answer195959> Your MacBook Pro HDMI port is output only.   So no, you can not use it as input for your recording.  Your alternatives are USB 3 or Thunderbolt.  <answer272779> you need a hub that captures like USB Capture HDMI Magewell   <answer277520> Trying to figure this out also - BUT with HDMI to Firewire...looks like I may need an additional adapter of male Firewire IEEE connection to female HDMI    I do have a FireWire 800 hook up on the back of my 2010 iMac to to my DVR (Firewire IEEE 1394 input) using a cable like this https://www.amazon.com/Clear-IEEE-1394-Firewire-Cable/dp/B00699GJW4 - The one I picked up was a Belkin about 6 years ago. From there I use a program called AVS Browser which automatically reads my DVR. Then I stream through VLC player.  Kind of ticked me off..just a little when I asked an associate at a local computer store this past week of FireWire to HDMI for video, in this smug tone he said - "huh? No such thing, Firewire doesn't work for video, just data" Yeah, 50% true! I wasn't even going to get into it, but yes Firewire WILL work with video connected to a DVR, The video stream is well "data" (NOT all channels on my Fios box works..some network are blocked and will not record. Many do.)  <comment233977> HDMI is an output structure, not two-way, so… no. <comment234132> Ah, ok. But the camera does have a mini-HDMI out. So HDMI to Thunderbolt? <comment234133> Capturing HDMI output via HDMI is possible. People are doing it, but what is the easiest way via MacBook Pro? <comment234142> your next step will depend on what camera you have. I just clarified that you can not use the HDMI-port as input on your Macbook. If you have additional question do not hesitate to ask. The camera HDMI output on your camcorder is for viewing on TV or Monitors (with HDMI input). <comment342838> This doesn't make sense either technically or grammatically.
