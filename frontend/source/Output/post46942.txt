Lion OS install for new SSD. Do I need to install Leopard first? <body> I was going to replace my HDD with a SSD - but I need to install Lion for my SSD.  Do I need to install Leopard on the SSD first, then go to the Mac App Store to update?  <answer46943> No, you can install Lion directly if you want. This will save you a lot of time, as you would otherwise have to upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard first, only to upgrade to Lion afterwards.  h3Buy a bootable OS X Lion USB stick/h3  You can buy a bootable OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive from the Apple Store: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD256Z/A  img src="https://i.imgur.com/iXU2K.jpg" alt=""  h3Create a bootable OS X Lion USB stick or DVD based on the Mac App Store download/h3  ol liBuy and download Lion from the Mac App Store.
