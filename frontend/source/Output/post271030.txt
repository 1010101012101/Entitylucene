iPhone 7 Plus camera never switches to telephoto <body> Recently I discovered that my iPhone 7 camera's telephoto is never used when taking 2x photos. I half covered the telephoto lens, in bright light I should be able to see my finger in 2x mode by covering the telephoto camera. But my finger never appeared on the image. I'm pretty sure it is not a lighting issue as I am doing this test right under sunlight. Before this happen, I can trigger the switch in pretty dark places. Of course both camera lens works because I can use the portrait mode just fine.  Have anybody else ran into this issue?   strongEDIT/strong: I just checked, and found that this only happens in Photo, Video, and Square mode where it doesn't switch. In Slo-Mo, Time Lapse, and Panorama it switches as expected. I am on iOS 10.2.1, but I think this happened before it.
