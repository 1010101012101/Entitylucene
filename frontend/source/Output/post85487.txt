Is the UUID command missing in 10.8.2? <body> I just noticed that the uuid command is no longer working on my MacBook. One possibility is that it was removed when I upgraded to Mountain Lion. The man page is still available.  precodeman uuid /code/pre  Does anybody else have this problem with 10.8.2?  <answer85488> The command you probably are looking for is codeuuidgen/code.  codeman uuid/code shows the manpage for the UUID library (uuid.h).  <comment98514> Doh! That's it. Thanks!
