Can't change permissions on RAM disk <body> Why can't I set root as folder owner?   precodediskutil erasevolume HFS+ "VTest" $(hdiutil attach -nomount ram://1165430) cd /Volumes/VTest/ mkdir TDir sudo chown root:wheel TDir/ ls -l drwxr-xr-x  2 user  staff  68  7 янв 16:06 TDir /code/pre  But it works fine for folders on any other drive(physical)  <answer267787> RAM is mounted codenoowners/code. You can change permissions of the files, but not change the owners.  The owner will be shown as the current user. Using the root user shows code_unknown/code.  precode$ touch test $ ls -l test -rw-r--r--  1 grgarside  staff     0B  7 Jan 14:02 test $ sudo ls -l test -rw-r--r--  1 _unknown  _unknown   0B  7 Jan 14:02 test /code/pre  <answer267792> Creating a RAM disk this way disables ownership. To enable ownership additionally enter:  precodesudo diskutil enableOwnership diskX /code/pre  To add folders use codesudo mkdir folder_name/code. The folder has root:wheel 755 permissions then, but you can change ownership to other users later.  <comment336065> idk why, but just to confirm I can't either... or, to clarify, I can change perms but not owner/group. <comment336072> What are the results with `sudo ls` ? I suspect the ram disk is mounted `noowners`. <comment336101> If I do that on my RAM Drive the output for `sudo ls -l test` is `-rw-r--r--  1 me  staff  0 Jan  7 13:01 test` not `... _unknown  _unknown ...`. That said, I'm running OS X 10.8.5 at the moment and it may be different in later major releases of OS X and or macOS 10.12.
