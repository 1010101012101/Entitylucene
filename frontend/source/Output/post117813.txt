Show table of contents when opening PDF in Preview <body> Is there any way I can force Preview to always show the table of contents when opening a PDF? Most of the PDFs I use have a ToC, so this would save me the extra step from having to enable the ToC after opening the PDF.  <answer117816> This is currently not possible to be set as default in Preview. The closest you can get to this is Preferences â†’ Opening for the first time: Always show sidebar. However, the sidebar that opens is the default thumbnail view, not the TOC.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBnA0.png" width="400"  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul
