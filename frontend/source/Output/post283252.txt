How do I remap a key in macOS Sierra, e.g., Right Alt to Right Control? <body> I used to use Karabiner to remap Right Alt to Right Control (as an Emacs user I use Control MUCH more that Alt) but updating to Sierra broke this.  Downgrading is not an option.  How do I manually remap keys in Sierra?  I specifically would like to remap Right Alt to Right Control.  <answer283253> Apple's Technical Note TN2450 describes how to remap keys.  Running the following command will remap Right Alt to be Right Control.    precodehidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":     [{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e6,       "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e4}] }' /code/pre  Note that the above command is not switching the Right Alt and Right Control.  They will both be Right Control.  If you have a MacBook, you will not notice this until plugging in an external keyboard.  If you want to emswitch/em Right Alt and Right Control, you need to add a second switch command, like the following.  precodehidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":     [{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e4,       "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e6},      {"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e6,       "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e4}] }' /code/pre  The table at the bottom of the Technical Note has a list of hex values for each key.  To generalize the above answer to switch any keys, you must codeor/code the hex value from that list together with code0x700000000/code.  The following Python code demonstrates one way to do this.  precodeIn [1]: def convert(val):    ...:     int_val = int(val, 16)    ...:     ref = '0x700000000'    ...:     int_ref = int(ref, 16)    ...:    ...:     return hex(int_ref | int_val)    ...:  In [2]: r_alt = '0xE6'  In [3]: print(convert(r_alt)) 0x7000000e6 /code/pre  <answer283536> A more general and user-friendly approach is to use Karabiner-Elements, which is a version of Karabiner that works on Sierra.  <comment357093> Could you take a look at this https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/280855/changing-right-hand-command-alt-key-order-to-be-like-a-windows-keyboard you seem to might have the right idea how to answer the question. <comment366666> Nice - thanks! Is there any way to restore the mappings to their defaults with this command? <comment366706> @Cᴀʟʟᴏᴅᴀᴄɪᴛʏ to reset any key, you simply run the command again with that key's value in both `Src` and `Dst`.
