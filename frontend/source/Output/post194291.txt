Nano: how to obtain syntax highlighting? <body> I have a default installation of codenano/code under code/usr/bin//code, and I am trying to make codenano/code highlight the bash scripting language code.  I have been searching around, but I had no success: I got always some errors, or simply doesn't work. For example, I have tried to download the following repository from Github codegithub.com/nanorc/nanorc.git/code with the following command:  precodegit clone https://github.com/nanorc/nanorc.git /code/pre  and then follow the steps in this post, but I have had errors because some command inside the files are not recognised. In particular, if I add this line codeinclude ~/nanorc/shell.nanorc/code to my file code~/.nanorc/code, where the file codeshell.nanorc/codecontains:  precodesyntax "sh" "\.sh$" "\.bash$" "bashrc$" "bash_profile$" header "^#!.*/(env +)?(ba|k|pdk)?sh[-0-9_]*( |$)"  FUNCTION: "^[A-Za-z0-9_+-]+[[:space:]]*\(\)" KEYWORD:  "\&lt;(case|do|done|elif|else|esac|fi|for|function|if)\&gt;" KEYWORD:  "\&lt;(in|select|then|time|until|while)\&gt;" FUNCTION: "\&lt;(echo|exit|export|let|local|read|return|set|shift|umask|unset)\&gt;" FUNCTION: "\&lt;(source)\&gt;" OPERATOR: "[{}()&lt;&gt;!=&amp;|;`$]|\\|\[|\]|-(eq|ne|gt|lt|ge|le|s|n|z)\&gt;" STRING:   ""(\\.|[^"])*"" VARIABLE: "\$\{?[A-Za-z0-9_!@#$*?-]+\}?|`[^`]*`" STRING:   "'(\\.|[^'])*'" ESCAPE:   "\\.?" +HASHCOMMENT +TODO +LINT /code/pre  It seems that these previous commands, such codeSTRING/code, codeESCAPE/code, etc, are not recognised.  How would you set syntax highlighting for nano, at least for bash?  <answer209602> From the Nanorc(5) man file:     The configuration file accepts a series of set and unset commands, which  can be used  to  configure  nano on startup without using the command line options.  strongAdditionally, the emsyntax/em, emcolor/em, and emicolor/em keywords are used to  define  syntax  highlighting rules for different text patterns./strong  nano will read one command per line.   Your nanorc lacks that.  From the git read me from that repo:     strongWhy do I get weird errors when running nano &lt; 2.1.5 on *BSD systems?/strongbr   In order to reliably highlight keywords, this projects makes heavy use of the GNU regex word boundary extensions (\&lt; and ). BSD implementations also have these extensions but use a different, incompatible syntax ([[:&lt;:]] and [[::]]). Since version 2.1.5, nano can automatically translate the GNU syntax to BSD syntax at run-time, but for the benefit of people running a pre-2.1.5 version of nano on OS X or *BSD, the .nanorc file itself can be translated by installing with make BSDREGEX=1.   What is happening is that strongyou did not actually follow the full install commands/strong. If you cloned the git, cd'd into the directory, and ran make install, your syntax files would look different. For one, the default version of strongnano/strong on OS X (I'm on 10.10.5 Mavericks) is strongnano 2.0.6/strong. It does not support the strongheader/strong in syntax in this older version. The makefile for the git repo would remove that. And it would add in the color options.  You have 3 options.  ol liEnsure you have the OS X command line tools (or full X Code) installed and run all of the install commands./li liuse precompiled nanorc syntax files compatible with the preinstalled nano 2.0.6 with BSD regex./li liInstall a newer nano, and use the nanorc that come with the full install./li /ol  As a bonus, I found and edited a single nanorc for sh/bash.
