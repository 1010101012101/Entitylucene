Traffic from an unknown process called Torque <body> I am seeing traffic from a process called torque at Library/Application Support/Torque.app/Contents/MacOS/Torque it is connecting to thousands of ip addresses.  After searching for a while all I can find is that it may be related to some bit torrent software.  My question is: is it being utilized by another process? Is it a stand along application? I didn't install it (at least knowingly) and would like to remove it but I want to be sure i dont break an app that I use in the process. Unfortunately my attempts to figure out what program is using it have not been fruitful.  <comment106876> You can always rename "Torque.app" to something else, reboot and see whether it breaks anything. <comment106886> @patrix currently, what I've done is block the incoming and outgoing connections using little snitch. I will try that next if this doesn't produce results. <comment106892> Perhaps this ... http://torque.bittorrent.com/labs/
