Can I use my early 2009 iMac as an external screen? <body> I have an early 2009 iMac (24" version). It has a mini display port in the back. Is it possible to use it as an external screen? If so, how do I do it? And can I attach all kinds of devices, e.g. a Raspberry Pi (with an appropriate adapter cable)?  <answer53728> Check in the user manual for your particular model for Command-F2 as a shortcut to enter target display mode.   If yours has a target display mode, you are good to go. If not, then no.  I don't think that any 24-inch iMac model supports this. Initially the 27-inch models had this feature and later it trickled down to the 21-inch models.  <answer53738> The specifications for the 24" Early 2009 iMacs according to eveymac.com and the Apple Manual for the Early 2009 series of iMacs does not mention target display mode as a feature.  That unfortunately means that the Early 2009 generation of iMacs did not offer a target display mode so you will not be able to use that displayport output as an input source.  <comment126714> Were you able to confirm that an early 2009 24" iMac does *not* support TDM? <comment126835> Yes, I can confirm that!
