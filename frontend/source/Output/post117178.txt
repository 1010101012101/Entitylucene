How can I launch .sh scripts from the finder in iTerm2 instead of Terminal? <body> I have set 'always open with' to : 'Iterm2', for .sh files in osX.br Although a double click on a shell script now opens a new Iterm window, the script does not actually run, I just the get the empty prompt. There might be an applescript solution, but I would prefer a more direct way.  <answer117358> It works for me but only if the file is executable. For example this runs codea.sh/code in a new window:  precodeecho say a&gt;a.sh;chmod +x a.sh;open a.sh -a iTerm /code/pre  If you want it to work with non-executable files, set an application like this as the default application for code.sh/code files:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/arLQX.png" alt=""  <comment137167> Thanks, I followed your instructions, even though my .sh files are already executable. Unfortunately : same result, it does open the iTerm window but just an empty prompt again!  It seems that iTerm does not listen to the argument, but I can't find any relevant setting inside iTerm. Are you using Iterm2 ?
