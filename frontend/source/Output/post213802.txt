Cannot reset default keychain <body> I recently forgot my login password, and had to change it through utilities and terminal. The problem is, after changing the password, the keychain access keeps asking for the "Local items" keychain password. I don't remember the stupid password. I tried everything. I tried to emReset My Default Keychain/em, didn't work. I tried keychain first aid, didn't work. I tried keychain first aid repair, did't work.   What is going on? Why is the computer keep asking for a keychain "local items" password?
