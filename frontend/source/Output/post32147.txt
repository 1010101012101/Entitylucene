Drag & drop and cut & paste not working <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Can anyone explain this clipboard behaviour?       This is weird. I'm on OSX Lion, and sometimes both drag &amp; drop and cut &amp; paste stop working, at the same time. They stop working in any program, not just the Finder. And it's not just the shortcut: if I try to right click and select "Copy" it doesn't work either.   This has happened three times so far. A reboot fixes it, but it's annoying at best. Anyone with the same problem? Any solution?  <answer32156> Well, since the question is “Anyone with the same problem”: yes, it seems at least another StackExchange user has the same problem in “Can anyone explain this clipboard behaviour?”.  <comment36911> This is a duplicate because you both have the same "cut & paste" stop working. Your question does also mention the drag & drop problem, but the overall question is the same: "Why is cut and paste not working?" I've also edited the other question to address the drag and drop issue. Please take a look at the [FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq) for more info. Thanks.
