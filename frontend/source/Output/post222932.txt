How to terminate cleanly another session? <body> I am the admin on a shared MacOS X: codeBig_server/code running codeYosemite/code. This technical detail isn't a key one: I have the same question with many versions of MacOS X from codeMountain Lion/code to codeEl Capitan/code.  But today I have a practical big case and time to analyze and test poor and good solutions. codeBig_server/code is hosting professionnal services and can't be rebooted to play.  I have another user codebob/code who left his session open. He forgot to close it and is on vacation for many weeks. I know how to kill codebob/code's session like a pig.  However, I noticed that this colleague has more than 50 processes running, some of them terminating with:  precode...Support/photolibraryd .../com.apple.CloudPhotosConfiguration ... /code/pre  and I would like to avoid corrupting any of his libraries or files which might have been left opened.  How may I terminate cleanly codebob/code's session without corrupting anything?
