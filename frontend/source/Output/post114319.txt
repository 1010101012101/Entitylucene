How to access /dev/mem in OSX? <body> How I can access /dev/mem (or /dev/kmem, /dev/pmap) equivalent device in OSX?  As far as I know it was removed in some point.  Can I create this node manually somehow or any other way of dumping the physical memory?  See:  ul liVisualization in testing a volatile memory forensic tool/li liKernel Debug Kit OS X/li /ul  <answer122672> According to Accessing Kernel Memory on the x86 Version of Mac OS X, code/dev/mem/code and code/dev/kmem/code were removed when Apple released OS X for Intel processors.  The (excellent) article also explains stronghow to reenable the memory devices/strong, namely using the codekmem=1/code kernel boot argument.   To set it, open Terminal, type:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="kmem=1" /code/pre  and reboot.  The article was written in May 2006, but the Mavericks 10.9.2 kernel still supports the option. After a reboot I saw these two devices:  precode$ ls -l /dev/*mem crw-r----- 1 root kmem 3, 1 2014-02-28 22:09 /dev/kmem crw-r----- 1 root kmem 3, 0 2014-02-28 22:09 /dev/mem /code/pre  strongIf your Mac won't boot or you have any issues/strong, reset the NVRAM by pressing kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd and holding the keys down until you hear the startup sound for the second time, as explained in "Resetting NVRAM / PRAM" in KB HT1379 About NVRAM and PRAM.  If you wish to reset the argument, type codesudo nvram -d boot-args/code and check that codenvram -p | grep boot-args/code does not print any results.  <answer293482> I think I got it to work on macOS Sierra! I downloaded comex's project: Kmem Project I compiled the kext, fixed the permissions and then loaded it! Using terminal I went into code/dev/code and codels/code showed both codemem/code and codekmem/code...  Edit: If you download the project you will just need to change the compiler in Xcode to use the latest ( for example... I don't know if other versions work though... )  For quick access to results I have already made a fork of comex's project which compiles on macOS Sierra! Kmem for Sierra Fork  Again, this is comex's work, not mine, I just changed the compiler setting and uploaded it! :)  <comment357798> I've tried this method in macOS Sierra, but it didn't make the devices show up under `/dev` .. perhaps do you know if Apple closed this option, and whether there's another alternative to access this memory in 10.12 ?
