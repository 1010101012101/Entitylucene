How do I specify placement of email signatures in Outlook for Mac 2011? <body> I cannot seem to find a way to set my automatic signature to be placed inline with my replies - that is, above the conversation thread and NOT at the bottom of the entire thread. It just doesn't make sense there, and causes me to typically add my signature manually, which then requires removal of the automatically added one as well.  There is not an option in the Composing preference pane or the Signatures one.  Using Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 14.4.9 on Yosemite 10.10.2
