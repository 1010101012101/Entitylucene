How do I restore my Apple Air to have the original resolution? <body> I have a brand new 13 inch macbook air.  It seems that I keep having with my first time Macbook Air.  First it was issues connecting to wi-fi and not resolution.  I last used my Mac on Sunday and I had no issues with resolution and today (Wednesday) I turned it on and as I was browsing the web I noticed that everything in a web browser looks smaller.  I did a command + 0 thinking i accidentally did that on firefox but that didn't do anything.  I went to Chrome and it had the same thing.      I went to system preferences  displays  and saw that I had the following option chosen:   Best for built-in display.    I then unselected that and chose scaled and selected 1280 x 800, which is the resolution that was there before and the one that works best for me but the text is "cloudy" or blurry if you will.  I've attached screenshots with the differences.  I hope someone can help me.  Thanks!  Screen resolution 1280 x 800 (this is the resolution i need but text looks cloudy)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F5Hmj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Screen resolution 1440 x 900 (this is where everything is smaller and nothing looks cloudy).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T9OY0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment120434> The initial resolution was probably the native resolution of the display (1440 x 900 or "Best for built-in display"). Are you sure you hadn't changed the default text size or zoom level in Firefox? <comment120527> Yes, I am sure.  Besides I have the same issue on other browsers so it has to be something else.  Quite puzzling.
