After waiting for my iPad to open it keeps rebooting without the loading screen. It keeps showing me the Apple logo... I waited for 2 hours for it to open, but nothing happens! I dont want all my videos, and pictures to be deleted... plss helpp  <answer190598> Connect your iPad to a Mac or PC using the iTunes application. Try to make a backup from there; if that worked, restore the iPad to factory defaults (that basically erases everything that's on it) and restore the backup you just made.  For the future: Make a backup regularly, or you strongwill/strong lose your data some day.  <comment226320> Do you have your iPad backed up?
