Remove all associations with Brackets <body> I just downloaded Brackets (web development IDE) and it associated lots of unnecessary file formats like .json that I would normally open using Sublime. Is there any way I can remove all file associations with Brackets and assign them to Sublime or at least, to TextEdit?  <answer239852> strongHere's how to do it with any file (first method):/strong  ol liHighlight and right-click the file you want to change the default app for/li liMouse over codeOpen with.../code then click codeOther/codeimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fgx96.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liChoose the desired application (i.e. Sublime) in the codeChoose Application/code prompt/li liTick the checkbox codeAlways Open With/code, then press codeOpen/code (then close the application)/li /ol  strongAlternatively:/strong  ol liHighlight and right-click the file you want to change the default app for/li liSelect codeGet Info/code/li liSelect codeOpen with.../code in the window that just opened/li liChoose the desired application (from the drop-down list or codeOther/code)  ol liIf you are using codeOther/code, make sure to check codeAlways Open With/code before pressing codeAdd/code./li /ol/li liEnsure that the default application is displayed in the small box (as seen below, with Archive Utility)img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZdvMj.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect codeChange All.../code to apply it to all files of the same type./li /ol  <comment294613> Looks great, but not entirely what I was looking for. Due to very poor design of Brackets, I don't even know what file types they associated with their app and I was wondering if there is an option to remove all associations with certain app like you can on Windows. It's not a deal breaker, but, it's really frustrating when every single file opens in an app that is meant to be used for web development, not for file editing. Thanks anyways :)
