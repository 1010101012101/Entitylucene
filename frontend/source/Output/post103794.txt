Playlist questions for new iTunes update <body> I recently upgraded to the new 7.0 iPhone/iTunes update and am aggravated because my purchased music is included in playlists when I do not choose them. I have a lot of music that I have purchased just to complete a collection. I want only to play what I choose. How do you get them off the playlist and keep them from playing?  <answer103805> Don't be aggravated, take a trip into settings where you can quickly and easily turn this off.  codeSettings &gt; Music &gt; Show All Music:/code strongON/strong / strongOFF/strong  This settings toggles between:     All music that has been downloaded or that is stored in iCloud will be shown   and     Only music that has been downloaded to this device will be shown.   emNow you're sorted, go for a run and wind down/em ;)  <answer277524> It's under the "view" menu in settings that provides a choice between "all music" and "only downloaded music"  <comment122198> Thank you so much!!! It's fixed!!! God Bless You! <comment349294> Welcome to Ask Different!  This question is several years old, does your answer apply to the version of iTunes the OP specified?
