Where the ambient temperature sensor is located on 27" iMacs? <body> I'm using iStat Pro Dashboard widget to get live system data of my mid-2010 27" iMac.  Under temperature readings it lists strongAmbient/strong. Where the sensor is approximately located?   <answer75617> As per the manual and take apart guide provided by Apple to Apple Certified Mac Technicians: the ambient temp sensor is attached to the CPU blower (or fan).  <answer76325> I found this on iFixit below the page at strongStep 8/strong you will see the strongtemperature sensor/strong in strongorange/strong  http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2309+and+2374+Teardown/1236/1  EDIT : that's the temperature sensor from the LCD  At strongStep 12/strong they mention the sensors but don't really highlight them.   <comment87793> Thanks! I'd love to vote up your answer straight away, but do you have any sources for this? <comment88508> My source is the manual and take apart guide provided by apple to apple certified mac technicians.  I am an ACMT.
