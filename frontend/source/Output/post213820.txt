Exact string matches considering Case with COUNTIF <body> code=COUNTIF(B1:B7; "US")/code counts emanything/em with US us Us uS anywhere in the cell B1:B7br How to count ONLY emexact/em matches to "US" accounting for case? (only that string, only capitalized)  <answer213825> It would be great if this could be accomplished with a single formula, but as of this writing Numbers does not support Array formulas.    I was able to solve it by testing for "US" and returning "1" for true and "0" for false.  ul liFormula in adjacent or other column: code=IFERROR(FIND("US",A1),0)/code and drag formula down. (The codeFIND/code function allows for Case testing.)/li liThen using code=COUNTIF(range,1)/code where coderange/code is the cells containing a "1" get the count./li /ul  Note: this can be made dynamic by changing the formula slightly.  If codeFind()/code is changed to look at a cell where the user can input the search criteria, then the result can be any of the variances.   code=IFERROR(FIND([absoluteCellReverenceWithCritera],A1),0)/code - See last screenshots.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehjln.png" alt="Formula to test for US"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R3Uwa.png" alt="Count true"  hr / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aFM56.png" alt="Dynamic formula"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0MWjh.png" alt="Dynamic formula 2"
