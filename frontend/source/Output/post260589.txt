I can't find my backups <body> I restored my phone and updated it. I had a backup that I had taken a month back. I wanted to restore it from that backup but as soon as I connected my phone to iTunes, iTunes started backing up my new iPhone and my previous backups got lost. I can't find them anywhere. Please help.   <comment326301> Are you on Windows or macOS?
