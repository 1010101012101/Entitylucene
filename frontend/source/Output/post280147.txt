How to retrieve media and files deleted via git clean -fd from mac? <body> I deleted all the media and directories on my desktop folder by executing git clean -fd .. how can I get them back any recovery softwares ???  <comment352334> The fact that you deleted the files with git doesn't make it any different than any other way of deletion. Shortly - restore from backup. If you're using SSD with trim enabled, you're out of luck.
