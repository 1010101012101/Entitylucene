After "Service battery" disappeared, MacBook Pro keeps powering off suddenly <body> I've been warned by alert "Service Battery" for a couple of weeks, which at last has disappeared. But macbook keeps powering off suddenly with battery percentage below 20-10%, it depends on cpu load at that time: the higher is the load, the earlier the macbook pro will power off with higher battery residual charge.  I'm trying the SMC reset again and full battery recalibration through a whole charge cycle (full charge for 2 hours, full discharge, wait 5/6 hours at full discharge before charging again).  Also coconut battery percentage differs from mac os sierra percentage by 5%.  I'm referring to Battery warning &quot;Service Battery&quot; goes away by itself and High CPU consumption, 33% battery, suddenly MacBook Pro Retina shuts down saying it needs to be plugged in  Does anyone has experienced my situation? TIA
