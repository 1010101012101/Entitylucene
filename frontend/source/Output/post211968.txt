When can I remove the El Capitan install drive? <body> I have installed 10.11 from a USB drive, it has run as expected and I am now at the "Create account" screen (input name+username).   I will now turn the computer over to the person who will do the remaining steps.br Can I remove the USB drive at this point without problems?  <answer212032> Yes, you can now remove the install media and shut down the computer. Once the machine reboots into the Setup Assistant, it's safe to remove the install media.  <comment256055> For reference, could you add when exactly it becomes safe to do so? <comment256057> @timothymh Edited answer
