Adobe Reader unable to locate PDFs sent to iPhone <body> I can open my PDFs from iBooks, but Adobe Reader cannot find them on the iPhone.  How can I open them in Adobe Reader, which I prefer?  <answer204321> If you're transferring your pdf files through itunes, you need to open your device in iTunes, then select Adobe reader from the apps file sharing section and drag/drop the files you want to open with adobe. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sm85K.png" alt="Copy pdf to Adobe Reader through iTunes"
