ssd is full on os x <body> How do I know where the other is and how to remove it? I watched the entire disk, all the files occupy about 50 gigabytes, which could occupy the remaining space on the disk? Please tell me how to fix it?

Often, in a case like yours, there is a forgotten directory with installers around somewhere.  <answer220977> I'm normally not the kind of user to rely on "cleanup" apps, but I will have to say that MacPaw's CleanMyMac 3 has been wonderful at freeing up space on my computer (Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina with stock 256GB SSD). The first time I ran it I cleared out about 22GB of disk space, and I'm regularly removing anywhere from 40MB to 2GB of data cruft a day as of late.  <comment267457> Have a look at: [OS X: What is "other" space in About This Mac?](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202867)  -  Also have a look at: [How to Free Up Space Used By Time Machineâ€™s Local Backups on Your Mac](http://www.howtogeek.com/212207/how-to-free-up-space-used-by-time-machines-local-backups-on-your-mac/) <comment267459> @user3439894 You should add that as an answer (with a short explanation of what the link says, of course). Also, running Spotlight index might get rid of some of the "Other" and distribute it to each of the other categories. <comment267464> @RedEagle2000, I don't have time... getting ready for Christmas Dinner and then when the party is over clean up the mess.  Feel free to do it yourself. <comment267467> @user3439894 Nah, I don't want to take credit for your answer. Just post it whenever you can. Merry Christmas. <comment267541> Possible duplicate of [How can I figure out what's slowly eating my HD space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/5353/how-can-i-figure-out-whats-slowly-eating-my-hd-space)
