What Alfresco WebDAV URL on Mac? (Microsoft WebDAV extensions MS-DAVEXT?) <body> Alfresco contains a WebDAV server that can be accessed via two URLs:  ul liRFC-compliant WebDAV: codedav://server/alfresco/webdav/code/li liMicrosoft-compliant WebDAV: codedav://server/alfresco/aos/code/li /ul  The Alfresco documentation says:     Microsoft WebDAV extensions (MS-DAVEXT) are only partially compatible with the WebDAV standard, therefore it is recommended that you use /alfresco/aos on Windows clients and /alfresco/webdav on Linux-based systems.   strongQuestion: Which one should Mac users prefer?/strong  My main requirement is reliability, but if Mac can flawlessly use extensions I would be interested as well.
