Has someone set up an HP DeskJet 812C with SnowLeopard or Lion? <body> My parents have an old printer: an HP DeskJet 812C. I upgraded the OS on their iMac to SnowLeopard before checking if the printer was compatible. Unfortunately, it isn't. There's a Gutenprint driver for this printer, but the documentation looked rather involved. I didn't have much time to dedicate to the task.  Can someone simplify the gutenprint setup process for me? Has anyone successfully used an 812c with SnowLeopard or Lion?  <answer41397> They decided to not bother trying to get Gutenprint to work; they bought a new printer.  <comment40582> You may as well get them a new printer, they can be as cheep as $20. <comment40653> That's something we are considering.
