How to fix permission denied for home folder with Apache in Mavericks? <body> I recently activated the apache that ships with OS X Mavericks. I followed some tutorial to set up the web-server, however. When I browse to my home-filter at codehttp://localhost/~nazeem/code, I get the following error: codeYou don't have permission to access /~nazeem/ on this server./code  strongInstallation steps/strong  To setp up the webserver, I took the following steps:  ol liactivated the webserver with command: codeapachectl start/code/li lienabled PHP by checking if the module is loaded/li lichecked if the home folder module is loaded/li limade the user based configuration file, in code/etc/apache2/users/nazeem.conf/code The content is as follows:  code&lt;Directory "/Users/nazeem/Development/Websites/"&gt;         Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks         AllowOverride All &lt;/Directory&gt;/code/li /ol  strongPermissions/strong  ~/nazeem : drwxr-xr-x+ ~/nazeem/Development : drwxr-xr-x ~/nazeem/Development/Websites : drwxr-xr-x  strongLog/strong  The apache log says the following:  precode[Mon May 19 21:22:57 2014] [error] [client ::1] client denied by server configuration: /Users/nazeem/Sites /code/pre  In My opinion this is remarkable, as the path code/Users/nazeem/Sites/code is nog what I defined in my user configuration.  strongVersions/strong  OS X Mavericks 10.9.3 Apache 2.2.26  strongemDoes anybody know how to solve this?/em/strong  <answer131319> In your computer's main apache config file, there is a designated "DocumentRoot", which appears to be set to ~/Sites - hence /Users/nazeem/Sites.  Try setting a document root in your /etc/apache2/users/nazeem.conf file, something like this:  DocumentRoot "/Users/nazeem/Development/Websites"  That's NOT within the Directory section of your nazeem.theconf file.  Note that the main apache config probably also designates the directory aliased as "cgi-bin". It's probably /Library/Webserver/CGI-Executables. Either use that directory for your executables, or post a follow-up about ScriptAlias settings.  And of course after any change to your apache config:  sudo apachectl restart  HTH  <comment154238> If you didn't restart apache after making the configuration file changes, then it would end up using the default for your user ( ~/Sites ).  Run "apachectl restart" and see if it works like you expect. <comment154243> Thank you for your reply. I already did that, and the result stays the same.
