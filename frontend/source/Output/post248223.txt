Install Virtualbox dmg <body> I'm very new to Macs and I'm trying to install strongVirtualBox 5.1.2/strong.  Once I download the dmg file and double click on it, I get a virtualbox window asking me to double click on a strongpkg/strong file.  The problem is the strongpkg/strong file presents a loader labeled emverifing "VirtualBox.pkg".../em, see the image below, and does nothing else - Virtualbox simply does not install.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b4qX0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Can anyone help me, please?  <comment306492> Go to **System Preferences**  **Security**. Make sure that **Allow Apps downloaded from** is either at App Store and trusted developers, or anywhere. If the former doesn't work, try the latter too <comment306519> @TheBro21: tried both settings but nothing happened
