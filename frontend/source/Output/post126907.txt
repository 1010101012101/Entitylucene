L2TP/IPSec with certificate machine auth <body> Do recent iOS versions (6.x or 7.x) support L2TP/IPsec VPNs where the machine authentication is done using RSA signatures of x509 certificates?  The "iOS: Supported protocols for VPN" document seems to say that only PSK is supported for L2TP based VPN, but that "pure IPSec" (aka Cisco) supports either mode.  The "Configuration profile reference" guide seems to disagree though, under "IPSec dictionary keys" it has the following for codeAuthenticationMethod/code:     Either SharedSecret or Certificate. Used for emL2TP/em and Cisco IPSec.   (Emphassis mine, note also that despite the dictionary name this is definitely the place that the codeSharedSecret/code key for L2TP is defined).  So what gives? Is it possible to make an iPhone connect to an L2TP/IPSec VPN using a client certificate for machine authentication like Android and Windows clients do? Or do I have to give up and add a PSK based proposal in Racoon? I can't see a way to make the iPhone configuration utility generate such a configuration and the UI on the device itself doesn't want to do it either.  <comment148683> It occured to me that it might be possible to manually edit the profile generated by the configuration utility to do that, but on iOS 6 at least it failed with an error message about a missing SharedSecret
