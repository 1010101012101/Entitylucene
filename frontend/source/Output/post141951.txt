Notes.app - how to access history? <body> Since notes.app seems to accrue a "rolling history" of data and doesn't automatically save out versions of your files to disk in any reasonable way (date stamped, etc), I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to access the emhistory/em of the note data you have accrued.  Specifically this came up because I am trying to restore something that I have lost, because the codeundo/code command doesn't work in the app.  Any tips would be appreciated.  <answer141953> No, there is no history of notes. Once modified and synchronised, the note is overwritten and older versions are not available. Per my answer on your last question, you may be able to obtain older versions if a device has been offline, but besides this, unfortunately not. You can provide feedback to Apple at apple.com/feedback.  <comment167277> apple rarely listens to user feedback.  one might hope that they would monitor discussions that happen in a place purportedly as ubiquitous as this, but alas.  i have little patience for the apple support community site. <comment167282> The Notes data file gets backuped up via Time Machine (and any other backup mechanism). Can you get it back from there?
