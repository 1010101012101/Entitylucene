Deleting an app from within the App Store <body> This is one of those questions where the answer is probably just "no", but I have a mildly irritating problem: if I go to the "updates" tab in the iphone App Store, there are loads and loads of updates for free apps that I installed ages ago but never use.   What I want to do is to delete these apps from my phone, so that they won't clutter up the updates list any more. However, the only way I can find to remove an app involves finding it on the home screen. So for every app on the list I have to exit the App Store and figure out which folder I put the app in before I delete it. This is so much of a hassle that I never do it, and so the problem gets worse.   So my question is: is there any way I can delete an app directly from within the App Store, or else go from the App Store directly to the folder on the home screen in which the app is located?  <comment150683> Rather than trying to delete the apps that require updates from App Store. Why don’t you start to prune down the apps you don’t use? In fact, if you use those apps, you want to update them. <comment150684> Because there are loads of them and it's a hassle. I have 30GB free space, so I have no reason to delete them other than the slight inconvenience of a cluttered update list.
