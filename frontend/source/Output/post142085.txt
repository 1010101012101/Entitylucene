Can I restrict the times during which iTunes downloads podcast content? <body> I have a capped ADSL account that splits my bandwidth allocation 50-50 between anytime and download time (midnight to 6am). I therefore prefer to have any downloading happen during download time so as not to max out my anytime bandwidth and require top-up purchase.  I subscribe to a number of podcasts in iTunes and would like to be able to restrict the downloading of those podcasts to download time. Does iTunes (on Windows) offer any way to d this?  <answer142087> What you need to do is refresh the podcasts at a time during the download period and then set the update podcast to "Daily"  Find the settings button :-  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HIDwx.png" alt="settings"  And select Daily..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ICrUs.png" alt="Podcast refresh times"  This is because the Daily refresh will reset itself to download every 24 hours after that time..  As seen here I refreshed this morning and the next update will be 24 hours after that.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r0pr4.png" alt="Refresh time"  The caveat, of course, is that iTunes must be running at the time you want it to refresh  <comment167409> Ah that makes sense. I'll check that tonight.
