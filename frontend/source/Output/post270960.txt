Can "Print Slide Backgrounds" in Keynote be defaulted to unchecked? <body> In Keynote, "Print Slide Backgrounds" in the Printing Pane is always "checked" by default.  This is annoying as it wastes ink when printing.  I looked in the codecom.apple.iWork.keynote.plist/code file for some way to make this unchecked by default, but to no avail.  Is there a way to change this default setting?
