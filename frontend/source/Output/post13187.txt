Tweetdeck replacement for Mac <body> Is there a Tweetdeck replacement for mac? A program that'll allow me to post to both my Twitter account and Facebook accounts with a single action?  <answer13188> I'd probably check out Socialite ($20).  <answer13190> Try HootSuite. If you want it to become a desktop app, use this.  Otherwise, you can use the official Twitter client and configure the Twitter Facebook App to post your twitter updates on facebook.  You can also use Google Chrome and Mozilla's Prism (as a extension in the browser or as a standalone) to do the same thing.  <answer13197> The latest Twitter API terms of service  specifically prohibit clients posting to multiple social networks with a single click     5E: You may not use Twitter Content or other data collected from end users of your Client to create or maintain a separate status update or social network database or service.   So, even if clients like Hootsuite allow it now, I would expect them to not be able to do that in the future.  <answer13228> Babble  <comment13903> only trouble is, you cannot post into two social networks with one action. You have to "select twitter", post, then select facebook, and re-post. Unless I'm missing this feature. <comment13904> Ah, you're probably right; I haven't used it myself, but knew that it handled multiple networks. <comment13920> wow.  interesting point. thanks! <comment16028> Tweetdeck run on Mac, no? Isn't it an Adobe Air app? <comment35335> Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference.
