I'm in need of an application. Where can I ask whether somebody is interested in developing it? <body> It happens to me often that I have a specific need in my use of MacOS X. The problem of finding an application solving a specific problem most of the time results in being the problem of finding the right keywords for searching for it on the Web. As soon as I find the most adequate keywords, the application solving the problem is usually just a few clicks apart.  But sometimes the search remains unfruitful. In that case, and since I know there are hundreds (thousands?) of active Mac developers out there looking for ideas for new applications, where is the place where I can reach them, and say "hey folks, I have the following problem/need, and chances are I am not the only one having it"?  <answer188637> In my opinion this site is a good start for this kind of request. First ask a question about software recommendation (also add software-recommendation tag) or describe the problem You want to solve. There's a chance that someone knows the solution or the app which solves this problem. There are few question here, where Users write scripts, daemons and even apps.  I know that this answer does not exactly match the site You're asking, but sometimes it's worth to ask and get the feedback before You start to reinvent the wheel ;)  <comment223356> OK, thanks. I wrote a description of the problem I'm facing (it is here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188650/how-do-i-find-an-application-that-does-a-specific-task), hoping that somebody will point me to some existing software, or maybe create new one.
