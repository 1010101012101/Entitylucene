Use not-iCloud Apple ID mail address on Mail app <body> So I'm using an iCloud account registered with a Hotmail address and I wish to use it as mail account for my Hotmail account on the Mail app?br I know that I can solve it creating two different account, one just for my Hotmail mailbox and one for iCloud, but I'm have some little OCD complexes so...br I tried to change the IMAP and SMTP settings but nothing happened (still inactive) or is there some hidden settings which we can't change for the sake of security or whatsoever?  The same seems to happen with a Google Account (which is registered with the very same mail address).  <comment275229> How do you register iCloud account with Hotmail. In this case just create a new mail account in Mail directly onto hotmail <comment275232> Yeah that's my current setup, I was wondering if there is a way to "merge" the Hotmail mail account with the iCloud service (so I don't have an inactive iCloud mail account) <comment275233> No they are two providers <comment275234> I don't get what the problem is. Your Apple ID is just that, an ID. It has nothing to do with your email settings. <comment275236> @Tetsujin: under Mail app's Preferences  Accounts, right now I have a Hotmail account, which I use to send and receive emails, and an iCloud account, which is inactive. I question was if there is a way to activate the mail service of iCloud account using a Hotmail mail address. <comment275238> your iCloud email address will be your name@icloud.com Mail to hotmail will go to hotmail, mail to iCloud will go to iCloud. The 2 are distinct entities.
