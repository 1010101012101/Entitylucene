How do I escape a bad VPN sign on request <body> I get stuck and have to wait until the request times out when I enter a bad VPN request. I would like to cancel the request and enter a different VPN address. I tried control break like on Windows but it doesn't work.   I am using Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client version 3.1.05170. I use the company's default. Depending on how I am connected the VPN client doesn't recognise the .com address and I need to go to terminal mode and "ping" the site to get the IP address. Then cut and paste that to the VPN address bar.   Does anyone have better ideas?   <answer205873> You could try with the native option in your mac to use a different way to connect to your VPN, try this:  Go to strongSystem reference/strong  strongNetwork/strong  add a new connection (the plus sign on the down left corner) on stronginterface/strong select "VPN" on strongvpn type/strong select "Cisco VPN" change the name (if you like), Add your company's values and try it to connect, I used this option and my VPN works like a charm.
