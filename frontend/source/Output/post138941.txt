How do I stop the Adobe Creative Cloud app from auto-launching on login? <body> How do I stop the Adobe Creative Cloud app from auto-launching on login? I don't see any option of stopping this, and for some reason it's not in OS X's user login options.   <answer138945> It is loaded by default by code/Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist/code.   If you run  precodelaunchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist /code/pre  that will disable it for your user.  To turn it back on  precodelaunchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist /code/pre  <answer138993> ol liClick on the menu bar icon./li liClick the gear icon./li liSelect “Preferences…” img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wzlgq.png" alt="window"/li liUncheck “Launch at login”. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8gY8.png" alt="preferences"/li liNote: The "Preferences" option does not appear emuntil you log in to Creative Cloud/em./li /ol  <comment179542> This worked really well! Just wondering, is there a way to make this apply to the guest user account as well? <comment193058> That worked perfectly for me. Thanks! <comment206901> What a scummy application to make you accept the terms and login before disabling it <comment213391> It eats akmost 4% of my battery so yeah <comment217098> Preferences are no longer even there in Creative Cloud. Adobe is getting worse every day! <comment217099> After unloading it you can also delete the .plist and banish Adobe forever! (Or until next update :) <comment217146> @kakubei, I'm not sure what you're seeing, but I'm using the latest version and the option is still there. I just updated my answer to show how it looks now. <comment217886> That's interesting, on my machine I got nothing at all. <comment257334> @andrewtweber it's simple, they want you to have an account so much. <comment265797> Thanks, really annoyed by these background apps even unchecked the run at login. Still have the Core Sync Helper, anyone know how to remove it as well? <comment265798> The 'Launch at login' only apply to the menulet UI. Check your Activity Monitor and you will see there are bunch of background Creative Cloud still leaching your resources. <comment266001> I second @DazChong's request to disable Core Sync <comment289519> @DazChong and BenSinclair, I put up a question about this issue at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/236577/how-to-disable-adobe-core-sync-app-on-os-x-from-being-launched-automatically <comment322457> @DazChong is correct.  Is there any way to disable these extra processes? <comment329882> Works great. Then just `sudo rm /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist` to get rid of it entirely. <comment341670> Don't forget to also unload the Adobe Updater, which runs in the background too: `launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.adobe.AAM.Updater-1.0.plist` <comment354782> I created a Gist for a bash script. Just download it and run it. Feel free to add more processes to it in the future: https://gist.github.com/WadeShuler/670a281c1c29ab1aebb94a21798db155 <comment354783> I created a Gist for a bash script.
