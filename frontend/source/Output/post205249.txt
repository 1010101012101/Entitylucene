How to know what nsurlsessiond is downloading <body> I turned off all iCloud drive stuff and it seems something else is using it. I don't have photo sharing and photo syncing on between my Mac and iPhone. And I've turned off whatever I can. But still nsurlsessiond downloads over 400 MBs every time it runs; which sometimes is triggered with a restart of the system.  I did a sample process on it; but I have no idea what it means.  <answer205257> That daemon can be called from many, many sources.  I haven't found an easy way to summarize things, but since it works on a queue to upload or download things, my guess is you have a job that's timing out.  Here are some ways to pick apart the activity on your system:  precodesudo lsof | grep nsurl ps -ef|grep nsur sudo fs_usage -w | grep nsurl /code/pre  That will let you monitor things and see which of the several nsurl daemons is running when you measure 400 mb of transfer. You can also get a dump of the system activity with codesysdiagnose nsurlsessiond/code  If you determine that it's really iCloud Documents, you'll likely need codebrctl log -w/code to watch that subsystem instead of monitoring the worker threads that do the lifting.  <answer237207> In my case I have found that:  When backing up WhatsApp (on iOS - iPhone) chats to iCloud, it copies the backup into every machine that uses iCloud. The backup is placed into a hidden folder, on my machine (OS X 10.11.4) it is in the  /Users/UUUUUUU/Library/Mobile Documents/57T923XXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp/Accounts/NNNNNNNNN/backup  folder, where UUUUUUU is my username and NNNNNNNNN is my phone number.  Unfortunately the backup file for the media is in one huge archive (mine is  560MB) so every time WhatsApp backs up, the WHOLE file is re-downloaded, from what I can see. This is what nsurlsessiond is doing.  If you run the brctl log -w command mentioned above, you will see something along these lines:  precodereceived a push for container 57T923XXXX~net~whatsapp~WhatsApp [note]    2.335 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.114] cloudkit.operation.callback    sync-down.container-metadata BRCContainerMetadataSyncDownOperation.m:229 fetched 0 containers metadata from the cloud [note]    2.375 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.154] sqlite.serverTruth             zone.server               BRCServerZone.m:771 received 25 edited items from the cloud for 57T923XXXX.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp [note]    2.427 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.207] bird.scheduler.Apply Changes   accountsession       BRCAccountSession.m:1473 we will now download new documents automatically because the account contains less than 5 GB [note]    2.536 [2016-05-04 12:44:54.316] sqlite.clientTruth             fs.downloader          BRCFSDownloader.m:1469 downloading 11 documents in 57T923XXXX.net.whatsapp.WhatsApp /code/pre  Deleting the WhatsApp 'documents' (i.e. backups) via the iCloud storage management console in iOS or Mac OS X deletes the files from the Mobile Documents folder and thereafter there is no more activity from nsurlsessiond.  Hope this helps.  <answer252538> This was a really helpful post:  http://ayteck.blogspot.com/2015/09/limited-bandwidth-apple-and-hell-caused.html  For me, it was "auto update" from the App Store. Going to "system preferences - App store - disable updates", saved my hundreds of Mb per day in bandwidth. (and made everything faster)  <comment247588> Thanks a lot Mike. You're awesome. Can you just please tell me what each of those 3 commands you said, does? I entered them and I get list of files (assuming it's the files used by the process). But I don't understand what each column represents. I don't know what REG, CHR or 1,3 means. And I'm not sure if the last columns are the bytes sent/received by the process. Is there some sort of guide about this? <comment247614> @Milad Welcome to Ask Different.  There are many guides. Why not take one of the commands (maybe the `ps` one to start) and ask a new question. Before posting it, check the related questions and read through [ask] and show where your research failed you in learning what the command does. Ping me here with a link and I'll see what I can do. Answering follow on questions in comments is hard and doesn't help the site <comment314256> Welcome to Ask Different!

I had iCloud setup to Optimize the space on my Mac. When I turned Bootcamp off, it started to download all my stuff from iCloud to Mac. I wouldn't find that information without this thread, kudos to bmike!
