What is "Other" account on OS X Yosemite login screen? <body> I am using OS X Yosemite. I am seeing 2 accounts on my login screen. One is my account and the other has the name "Other". What account is that? When I click on it, there is no username. When I try to shut down my computer, I am now prompted to enter my username and password. Previously there is no need to do so. I have tried the suggestion here How to get rid of the &quot;Other...&quot;-Account on the login screen? but that only hides the "Other" account. I am still prompted for my username and password when I want to shutdown. How do I remove/disable the "Other" account, not just merely hides it? Thank you for the assistance.  <answer165042> I have enabled the root user acccount on my machine.  As soon as I did that, "Other" now shows up on my login page.  To enable the root user account run /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/DirectoryUtility.app, unlock the app, then click on Edit, Enable Root User, and key in a new root user password.  <answer165048> When you bind a user to open directory you could see this as well, depending on the settings defined.  <answer201759> Either try disabling the root user.  Go to emSystem Preferences strong/strong Users &amp; Groups strong/strong Login Options strong/strong Edit strong/strong Open Directory Utility/em and in the top menu choose emEdit/em and then emDisable Root User/em.  strongemOR/em/strong  Go to emSystem Preferences strong/strong Users &amp; Groups strong/strong Login Options/em and select emList of users/em.  <answer207386> This indicates you either enabled the root user or you connected to a directory service (Open Directory or Active Directory) for the ability to login with network accounts.    strongDirectory Services:/strong Open System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Login Options  Look for a Network Account Server in the main pane of Login Options and edit accordingly if one is present.  strongRoot User:/strong  "Open Users &amp; Groups preferences, click Login Options, then click the lock icon to unlock it. If necessary, type your password, then click Unlock. In the Network Account Server section, click Join or Edit. Click Open Directory Utility. Click the lock icon to unlock it, then enter your administrator name and password. Do one of the following: Choose Edit  Enable Root User, then enter a root user password in the Password and Verify fields.  Choose Edit  Disable Root User.  Choose Edit  Change Root Password, then enter a new root user password."  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH14281?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US   <answer239657> The only solution that worked for me was the following command:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWOTHERUSERS_MANAGED -bool FALSE /code/pre  <comment249646> Wondering if you found a solution for this as I've also noticed this today. Nothing new installed. <comment250128> You have to enter a password at shutdown? Do you have a screenshot? <comment250129> Never mind, just noticed this is 8 months old! <comment250266> Another way to get an authentication pop-up at shut-down is if another account is logged in.  If so, the pop-up is asking if you want to kill the other user.  If you see this, and you HAVEN'T switched users since power-up, you've got an intruder. <comment349974> This should be the accepted answer.
