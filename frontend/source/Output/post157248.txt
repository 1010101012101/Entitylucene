SMS remotely deleted <body> Can an SMS be remotely deleted, or have a Self deleting expiration Time? I recently experienced a situation where an SMS was remotely deleted or disappeared without my knowledge, off my phone. Just wondering if anyone had similar experiences similar stories that can relate.  <comment184880> Do you mean iMessage _or_ SMS? It has to be one or the other, and can't be both -- the Messages app on an iPhone handles both kinds of message, but they're completely different ways of sending text messages. <comment184881> If you can't tell which is which, messages in green bubbles are SMS messages and ones in blue bubbles are iMessages. <comment184901> Yes i suppose it was just SMS because iMessage was turned off. <comment184959> To answer your question, no, SMS cannot be remotely deleted or "self-destruct". Neither can iMessage, for that that matter.
