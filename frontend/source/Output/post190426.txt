Remove parts from AppleScript result <body> I want to remove a part of an AppleScript result. The part of my whole code is following  precodelist disks /code/pre  I get the result: code{"Macintosh HD", "MobileBackups", "home", "net", "USB-Stick"}/code How can I remove the part code"Macintosh HD", "MobileBackups", "home", "net"/code, so that only volumes that are not the whole time available are shown.  <answer190430> Try something like this:  precodeset mydisks to list disks set newdisks to {} as list repeat with currentdisk in mydisks     if ((currentdisk as string) is not equal to "net") and ((currentdisk as string) is not equal to "home") and ((currentdisk as string) is not equal to "Macintosh HD") and ((currentdisk as string) is not equal to "MobileBackups") then         set newdisks to newdisks &amp; currentdisk     end if end repeat /code/pre  You will have your desired list on codenewdisks/code.  <answer190434> precodetell application "Finder" to set disklist to every disk whose ejectable is true or local volume is false and name is not "home" and name is not "net" set namelist to {} repeat with diskitem in disklist     set end of namelist to name of diskitem end repeat return namelist /code/pre  <comment226073> Those AppleScript one-liners are quite something. <comment226089> I get an error notification: `number -1728 from 1 to «class furl»` <comment226356> I'm getting a very long result. Should I post it? <comment226357> That works, thanks! <comment226441> This isn't the correct method though. It won't work if any of those names change, like say with an OS update. <comment226715> With the new script I get as result "MobileBackups" - Thanks :) <comment226814> @user121028: Ok, I admit I was wrong several times. I think this one may actually work. I define "not the whole time available" to means either plugged into a USB port or connected through the internet.
