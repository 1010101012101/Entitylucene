Is there a keyboard shortcut for the therefore sign "∴" on mac? Or is there a way to create a keyboard shortcut for it? <body> The therefore sign "∴" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therefore_sign) is something I may need to use a lot. How can I get a keyboard shortcut for it?  <answer195101> I found several answers for you here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3685146/how-do-you-do-the-therefore-%E2%88%B4-symbol-on-a-mac-or-in-textmate  a google search is all it took.

If you need the actual symbol, for whatever reason, my solution won't get the job done.
