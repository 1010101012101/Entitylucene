Date and time settings disabled <body> My date and time has suddenly become  1 jam 2013  In date and time preferences the setting "set date and time automatically" is disabled by which I mean it's greyed out. It's ticked and set to 10.2.0.90  How can I reenable this setting to change the date?

If you are using a non-admin account you can click on the lock at the bottom of the pref window and enter any admin credentials to enable the setting.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FFET.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment149240> I am logged in as an admin and the lock symbol does not appear <comment149241> Are you in a managed environment (school, office) or is this your own Mac? <comment149245> Part managed (office) <comment149246> In this case the Timeserver setting could be centrally managed which means you should approach your IT support person.
