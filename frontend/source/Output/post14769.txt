How does one make screen captures with a shadow? <body> How to do beautiful print screens, with shadows on the border, like this image?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1jASd.png" alt="Screenshot with shadow"  Is the shadows automatic? A Mac tool? Do I need to manipulate the image in other programs like Adobe Photoshop?  <answer14770> The shadows aren't automatic.  There is a free tool called ImageShadowAdder that can do these for you.     <answer14772> No, you do not need to. This feature is built into Mac OS X.  To do this, press kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd then press kbdSpace/kbd. The selector will then change into a camera icon, and you can take a screenshot of the selected window with a shadow.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLCpe.png" alt="screenshot of screenshotting"  (I couldn't capture the camera icon)  End result: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vk8Va.png" alt="end product"  <answer21266> Actually I prefer strongemNOT/em/strong to capture with the shadow at all. There is a command line procedure for suppressing the shadows, but you can accomplish the same thing through the GUI of TinkerTool.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbBc9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Install TinkerTool and then under its "General" tab, un-check the box next to "Include shadow when capturing window".  <comment15889> +1 - I didn't know about the `space` option. Man, that's an ugly camera icon. <comment15890> +1 surprisingly i found out that not many people knew about this nifty feature in Mac OS X <comment15891> To make it easier, the spacebar doesn't have to be pressed right in the sequence like that: Cmd-Shift-4 [release] gives you the crosshairs, after which you can press and release the spacebar. <comment15892> The shadows are automatic if you press space and capture just a window. <comment15918> Hmm.  New one for me.  Thanks! <comment15964> That's a lot of junk you have on your Desktop. <comment23341> TinkerTool basically does just `defaults write com.apple.screencapture disable-shadow -bool true`. You can disable shadows for single screenshots with `screencapture -i -W -o`. (`-i` = interactive, `-W` = window selection mode.) <comment23414> Thanks for the explanation. While I can certainly perform command-line operations, I highly value tools like TinkerTool, MacPilot, Cocktail and DeepVacuum, which can do all sorts of command-line functions for me in a nice, simple GUI that organizes many parameters of many applications together in one place. <comment178599> Extra modifiers: Ctrl, capture to clipboard, Cmd-N in Preview will create a new window containing the screenshot; Option, eliminate the drop shadow <comment178601> You can get the camera icon by capturing a screen recording using Quicktime. It has to be the whole screen, though. Then grab a screenshot of a frame from the movie. If you try to just record a portion of the screen, then there's an invisible window floating above all others and when you hit Space, it'll highlight the whole screen in blue. <comment352483> You can also disable the shadow by holding ⌥alt when you click to take the screenshot.
