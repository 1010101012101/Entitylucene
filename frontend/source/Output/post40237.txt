"Error: Specified stack size exceeds hard limit" occurs during install <body> I've been trying to install a program for electron microscopy reconstruction on OS X 10.7 and when I execute it on codetcsh/code I got the following message:  precodeError: specified stack size exceeds hard limit /code/pre  I've been trying to change the hard limit using codelimit/code without any success.  <comment45513> What do you see for ulimit -a? Also what reconstruction package are you using? (We use a version of Reconstruct on windows used by neurology types, but we're always looking for something nicer!)
