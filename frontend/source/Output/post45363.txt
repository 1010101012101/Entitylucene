How to checksum for a DVD under Panther? <body> I'm helping a friend checking if a DVD was burned properly but he's saying that  under Panther there's no emImages/em menu in Disk Utility.  <answer45374> It looks like Panther's codehdiutil/code supports checksumming, even if the Disk Utility GUI might not:  precodehdiutil checksum myimage.dmg -type MD5 /code/pre  (The supported types of checksums are listed in the man page. A common one seems to be codeUDIF-CRC32/code. If you use codeUDIF-CRC32/code or codeUDIF-MD5/code the checksums will be calculated separately per partition.)  Or you could always simply use the codemd5/code command:  precodemd5 myimage.dmg /code/pre  <answer45376> Use hdiutil on the mounted drive:  precodehdiutil checksum /dev/disk1 -type UDIF-CRC32 /code/pre  The final calculated CRC appears at the bottom when the command completes running:  precodemacbook:~ me$ hdiutil checksum /dev/disk1 -type UDIF-CRC32 Checksumming Driver Descriptor Map (DDM : 0)…  Driver Descriptor Map (DDM : 0): calculated CRC32 $4F7D78B1 Checksumming Apple (Apple_partition_map : 1)  Apple (Apple_partition_map : 1): calculated CRC32 $C4E22BED Checksumming disk image (Apple_HFS : 2)       disk image (Apple_HFS : 2): calculated CRC32 $04805620 Checksumming  (Apple_Free : 3)… (Apple_Free : 3): calculated CRC32 $00000000 calculated CRC32 $52BB898F /code/pre  This final calculated CRC (code$52BB898F/code in the above example) is exactly the same as the one reported by Disk Utility:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/usqUR.png" alt="Disk Utility CRC"  You can use the codediskutil list/code command for assistance in finding out the mounted drive's name.
