Is it possible to reboot Macintosh drive leaving the BOOTCAMP drive intact? <body> I want to reboot my Macintosh drive because I want to 'clean' my MacBook up a bit and start fresh, but for university I use Windows on a separate Bootcamp drive.   I want to reboot the Macintosh drive whilst leaving the Bootcamp drive with Windows on it alone. Is this possible? If so, how?  <comment321460> Reboot does not affect the data on the drive do you mean reinstall and do you want to keep any occasion data e.g. Mail settings? <comment321492> You can reboot Windows or MacOS, and it will not affect either partition. <comment321571> Do you mean reset? Rebooting is just turning the computer off and back on. Resetting deletes the information from your Mac drive
