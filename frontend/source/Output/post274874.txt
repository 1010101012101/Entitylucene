If it possible to configure l2tp-vpn without using the GUI? <body> I'm configuring my VPN with the native OSX l2tp-vpn client on a 10.11 Macbook.  Right now the process is to open up the GUI and add all of them in manually. The VPN has about 20 different countries and regions, so it's a bit of a pain to add them all in:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Of6ED.png" alt="Taken from https://www.blackvpn.com/setup/mac-os-x/l2tp/"  Is it possible to configure without using the GUI? So I could use a configuration management tool such as Puppet to automate the config settings required?
