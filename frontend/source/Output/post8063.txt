How can I type a backtick (accent grave or "`") on a European (Dutch) keyboard? <body> How can I type a backtick (accent grave, or "`") on an European (Dutch) apple keyboard ?  <answer8082> According to this image from Apple's KB article, it appears to be between the kbdZ/kbd and kbdshift/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CmT3.jpg" alt="Dutch keyboard layout"  <answer256781> On European keyboard, press kbdalt/kbd + kbd9/kbd.  <comment8695> Do you mean this character : ` ? <comment8698> @Pierre W yes, that's backtick <comment8704> On mine, this character is under de Â£, next to the return key. It's a Europeen azerty (French I guess). I'm sure it won't help you :-/ <comment320390> What kind of European keyboard are you talking about?  The question is about the Dutch one, and the answer you gave seems totally wrong for that. You should delete it. <comment332165> This works for italian keyboard, thank you!
