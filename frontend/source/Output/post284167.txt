Prevent websites from taking over audio on iPhone? <body> An increasing number of websites like CNN.com take over the audio of my iPhone's Safari app with advertisements and pause the Music app.   How can I prevent this. I only need the audio on Safari when I am watching a video.   <answer284169> If your device is jailbroken, you can install strongDon't Kill the Beat/strong. This prevents apps other than Music.app from playing music. To allow an app to play music (e.g. a video in Safari), pause the music in Music.app manually yourself, such as with the Control Center.
