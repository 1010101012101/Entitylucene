Kernel panic after installing El Capitan <body> I've upgraded from El Capitan GM to Release today.  After the installer app has moved the install files, the mac tried to reboot but the screen stayed black. I shut it off using the power button and restarted it getting kernel panics every time:  precodeProcess 1 exec of /sbin/launchd failed, errno2"@/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/xnu/xnu" /code/pre  I tried booting in safe mode without any luck.  So I thought that this could have happened because of any faulty kexts. I booted in Recovery mode, used Disk utility to unlock my Macintosh HD, and navigated with the finder to "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/".  The strange thing is that there is no Library or System folder. I can only find these folders under /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Recovered Items/.  So I followed some advices from Apple support forums and deleted the folder /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Recovered Items/Library/Application Support/Virtual Box/". I also moved the kext file from Little Snitch to a newly created folder "Unsupported" to ensure that LS is not the case of the problem.  But nothing helped. Still getting the same kernel panic. What can I do?  <answer208610> Same here, booted into recovery and back to yosemite  cmd-shift-r keys down while booting  I guess 3 of 4 updates have failed for me last few years, getting tired of osx OS updates. Usually installs after a few attempts with startup utilities.  Better make a time machine backup before you try installation.
