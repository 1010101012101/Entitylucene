With control mean:  ul licodeGET/code urls (mean http GET method) - Via safari (e.g. the Safari will send the auth, session cookies, referere and so on)./li liget source of the page (strongafter/strong the Safari renders all ajax calls and such)/li licodePOST/code via Safari (for example using AJAX - but initieted from teh external script)/li lietc.../li liin short like: "mozrepl" :)/li /ul  Seems, here is nothing comparable yet.
