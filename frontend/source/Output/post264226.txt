Decompressing Images from an iPhone game? <body> I'm trying to open some textures from an iPhone game that I believe are using the PVRTC format:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s86Sn.png" alt="PVRTC image format?"  However everything I've tried in regards to opening it has failed. The PVRTexTool won't decompress it, the program only opens files with the extension .PVR and doesn't recognise it. I've also tried using TexturePacker but it doesn't recognise it either. It's been baffling me for a few days, any help towards decompressing the file would be appreciated thanks.
