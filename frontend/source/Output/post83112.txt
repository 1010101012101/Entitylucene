Mountain Lion on brand new MacBook Air gives warning that it's using Legacy FileVault? <body> I set up FileVault a month ago on this new machine. Everything seemed to be working fine. But now when I go to codeSystem Preferences&gt;Security &amp; Privacy&gt;FileVault/code when logged into a Mobile Account I get a warning that:     You’re using an old version of FileVault.      You’re using an older version of FileVault that encrypts your home directory    but not the entire disk. Do you want to keep using the older FileVault?   Though codeLegacy FileVault/code was pre-Lion?!? This machine can't even run Lion, let alone Snow Leopard...  This warning doesn't occur when logged into a Local account. It only pops up when logged into a Mobile account. The way our Macs are setup there is typically just one local codeadmin/code user and all other users are mobile Open Directory accounts on our OS X (also Mountain Lion) Servers.  What gives?  <comment95817> Perhaps Legacy FileVault is being used on the server? <comment95868> Server is new hardware and running Mountain Lion as well… <comment95906> Are the mobility options set to encrypt the home folder (in Workgroup Manager, it's Mobility preferences - Account Creation tab - Options subtab - "Encrypt contents with FileVault" checkbox)? <comment110435> Problem persists... To answer @GordonDavisson's question, these mobility settings on the ML Server are set to "Never". The MacBook Air has FileVault 2 enabled (and that is all that was set up. But now when visiting Security & Privacy System Preference we get the warning described in OP (above) and there's a new "Legacy FileVault" tab alongside the "FileVault" tab!?!
