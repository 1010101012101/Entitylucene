256 colors on Terminal.app <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How do I get vim to work at 256 colors in iTerm?       I would like to work on codevim/code (with the xoria256 colorscheme) in the default OSX terminal. However, it seems that Terminal.App does not support 256 colors. Is there a setting by which I could configure this?  <comment23023> I don't think this is a duplicate. This is specifically about 256-color support in Terminal, whereas the other question is specifically about iTerm. In any case, the direct answer to this question is that pre-Lion Terminal did not support 256 colors. However, as of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal now supports 256 colors (and they are enabled by default, because the default $TERM value is now xterm-256color).
