How many fans does a 2.26 GHz 15" 2009 MacBook Pro 5,5 have? <body> I have a 15" MacBook Pro 2.26 GHz purchased in late 2009, model "MacBookPro5,5".  The FanControl PrefPane reports   precodeRight Fan: -1 RPM /code/pre  Does this model only have one fan, or does it have two?  <answer88248> Two fans, unless it's a trick question and you consider them blowers :-)  See http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2009+Right+Fan/1710/1  <comment103279> Hm. That link is for "2.66 GHz" and faster. I have 2.26 GHz. Does that make a difference? This page appears to only show 1 fan: http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Installing+MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Unibody+2.53+GHz+Mid+2009+Fan/1536/1
