Turn off Safari 9 blinking in web inspector? <body> The web inspector in Safari 9 seems to have added this new "blinking" thing which I find somewhat annoying although it can be useful. How can you turn it off and on? Here is what I mean.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTV9l.gif" alt="blinking as content is manipulated"  <answer210089> This can be done in the Elements tab by disabling this little brush icon: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tAcmC.png" alt="Enable Paint Flashing"  <comment263699> What a mystery! <comment267102> Thank you, had to search for it; it's only visible in the elements tab (not in source) <comment272816> That's what it says in the written text part of my answer :) <comment278080> Most annoying thing I've ever seen...thanks! <comment301898> WTF isn't the option to turn this off with the rest of Apple's bewildering selection of nonsense under the `Debug` menu? "_Enable new block inside inline Model_"?  Whatever, Apple! <comment367951> Thanks. That blinking background was super annoying.
