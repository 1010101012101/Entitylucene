Example, I have 50 Mac(s) on my network, and I want each users automatically began on a specific default web site as their Safari Home Page.  Thank you so much and have a beautiful day.  Fabio  <answer208678> The fastest thing that comes to my mind is to send an UNIX command to the clients with the following contents:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari HomePage 'http://example.com' /code/pre  This sets the Safari homepage for the user that runs the command.  I hope this helps.
