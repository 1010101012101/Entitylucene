Do Mac disks need to be defragmented? <body> I cannot find any defragmenting application on the Mac, so is defragmenting disks for Mac necessary?  <answer252632> The general argument is you don't need to defrag.br SSDs certainly not, HDs not really, but you can if you like.  There are arguments for defragging periodically on a drive that is around 30 - 70% full.  I used to use iDefrag on my boot drive, once after each OS update. It claimed to be the only app that correctly preserved the 'hot zone'. The perceived difference was minor, but I felt worth the effort. Since I moved to SSDs I haven't even launched it.br I don't think I've ever bothered defragging a non-boot drive.  There's a well-reasoned argument on the Apple forums at 'can you or should you defrag your mac' though I think with modern high capacity drives, it becomes even less necessary.  <answer253513> If you are defragging Mac hard drive just to increase its performance, then you can resolve these issues very efficiently by the help of below mentioned free tips: -  1.Quit all the open apps to free up some memory.
