Facebook not displaying birthdays in iPhone calendar <body> I have an iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.3 and I would like to have Facebook events in my calendar (again). I have enabled sync in Settings-Facebook by giving Facebook access to the calendar.  The calendar has been configured to show both Facebook-events (activiteiten) and Birthdays.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/g2om7Qi.png" height="450" img src="https://i.imgur.com/NeA1xjD.png" height="450"  Unfortunately the calendar doesn't show any Facebook event nor Facebook birthday. Only when I manually accept an event, it will show it in my calendar. I would love to see both events, but I care mainly about seeing the birthdays of my Facebook contacts.  <comment122368> Sounds like you r not syncing. And what do you mean with AGAIN ? <comment122372> It might have worked before. Can you explain what you mean by sounds I am not syncing? If I overlooked a setting, I would love to know.
