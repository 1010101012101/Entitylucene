Can't switch from Calendar month view to day <body> From the calendar month view, I can't select a date, and jump to the day view.  Running iOS 9.0.2 on iPhone 6  <answer208440> It depends on whether you have the 'overview' icon at the top of the screen on or off.  If it's On, your day view is underneath the Month...    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cxVIv.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  If it's Off, then tapping a day will take you to the Day View    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDZd6.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  unless the same icon is also On in Day View, in which case it will go to Event List view    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AxJM4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210036> Found another thread on it - you have to tap QUICKLY to open day view. Double-tapping works because the first tap is fast enough.   Seems to be an iOS 9 issue.   <comment251872> My overview icon is off and I can't open individual days either. Started as soon as the update happened and of course since the update it's told me to update 3 more times!
