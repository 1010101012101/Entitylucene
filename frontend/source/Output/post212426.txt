Didn't get a response from the Apple Software Update Center? / Can't load data from the Apple Software Update server <body> The past few days I 've been encountering this problem. When I search for updates through the Mac App Store, there comes a pop - up window. Either this : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLuLx.png" alt="enter image description here"  or this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PV16k.png" alt="enter image description here"  Î™ also "cleared cookies" and "resetted the application" through the Debug menu, but these options didn't seem to offer any help.  <comment256510> The Mac App Store has been having issue the least few days, from what I hear.  Not sure if it has been resolved, but may want to stay patient or download the updates manually from apple.com/downloads. <comment256511> @willWorkForCookies Ok, thank you! I thought I was the only one having this issue, since there were no enough results referring to the specific problem, when I googled it.
