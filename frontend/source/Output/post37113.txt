Finding the Holy Grail of PIM. (Was: is there a good replacement for AddressBook Lion?) <body> The Address Book application in OS X Lion is sorely lacking in its ability to sync &amp; combine contacts from different sources. Does anyone know of a good replacement?  Update - My Holy Grail:    ul liI use a personal Gmail account and a work Google Apps account.  /li liI'd like to have the same info available on my iPhone, iPad, work Mac, home Mac, and Google via a browser.  /li liWhile I'm at it, let's throw in connecting to my contacts in Twitter and Facebook, though those are much lower priority./li liI'd like a local copy of all the info in case the cloud isn't available./li liiCloud syncing isn't really a priority, since I use Google for that, but I could see switching what I can if things would work better. /li liIdeally, groups would be sync-able, in addition to contacts, but I don't think google exposes that via their APIs yet./li /ul  Currently, I'm seeing a lot of duplicates, or near duplicates in both iCal &amp; AddressBook, and it's very difficult (impossible?) to see where a given contact or appointment is coming from. In the past I used Spanning Sync to keep google and the local in sync. Perhaps that + iCloud is where the dupes are coming from.  Update 2: My current set-up is working fairly well on the iOS devices w/ Exchange connections to google. It's the macs where I find myself tempted to abandon the desktop apps for doing everything in the browser.  <answer46983> Have you looked at this list of PIM software on Wikipedia?  <answer52474> You could have a look at Cobook. I've just started using it and it seems like it unifies things pretty well. It uses the default OS X address book as a backing so that everything syncs nicely to your iPhone. It will also pull in data from your social networks so there's your added functionality.  <comment42146> To add detail to this question, which sources are you interested in? <comment42152> Seems like with adding that info, the question has outgrown it's original title....
