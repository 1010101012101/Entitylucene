Mac Photo Syncing Issues <body> Since updating my MacBook to Mavericks and the update from iPhoto to Photos, iTunes is no longer syncing any photos to any devices. I don't use the cloud, but purely uploading photos to; 1. iPhone 2. IPad  I have tried loads of things without any luck. Hopefully some has a work around.  <answer233211> I don't use iCloud.  My photos are only synced between Mac and iOS devices. At least that's the plan but that doesn't work.  <comment285028> Do your photos show up when you pull up your iCloud account at iCloud.com?
