Remove an app from Notification Center preference pane <body> My girlfriend added Facebook to my Notification Center. I tried to set the alert style to none, and you can see the check mark to show items in Notification Center is deselected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ja1a9.png" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/qRaKV.png"  I want it completely gone but don't know how else to configure things.  <answer84076> Go to Mail, Contact &amp; Calendars and click on minus sign (-) after selecting Facebook on the left pane.   <answer131895> Open Safari › Preferences › Notifications There you can remove objects permanently.  <answer157531> Just drag it down to Not in Notification Center list.  <answer218789> There's an answer found here that worked for me with an app I had uninstalled but was still in the notification center: http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/remove-app-from-in-notification-center-list.1425365/  <answer223710> I had this problem too. Go to System Preferences  Internet Accounts . You can remove Facebook account from there and then it will no longer appear in the notification center at all  <answer234626> Just remove it using Safari-Preferences-Notifications-Remove/Remove all  <answer291220> Finder - Go to floder - ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ - Delete the plist file related to notification - Done.  <comment96728> Have you tried signing out / deleting Facebook from the Mail, Contacts, Calendars system preference pane? Just select Facebook on the left and press - to delete the feed. After a reboot, you might try adding Facebook again and see if it's not sending notifications, but you might have to choose to remove that account if there is a bug in the controls. You're doing the correct steps in Notification center controls AFAIK. <comment96807> Actually I did that before asking the question. Is there anything else I can do? <comment185235> The App is already in the Not in Notification Center list. <comment212508> Although technically wrong, I'm glad Bob tried to help because this answer helped me with a similar issue. <comment317055> Same problem with the Hazel application.  I've deleted the application, but it's still listed in the Notifications preferences!  Very irritating. <comment351194> Not possible in Sierra, not listed there <comment355643> I just did this in Sierra.  There is a remove button and a remove all button in the window that opens from SafariPreferencesNotifications <comment367672> Can you say which file specifically should be deleted? <comment367955> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11993145/remove-application-from-notification-center
