Running shell commands with Automator: how to create a droplet launching an "exec" command? <body> I need to create a automator application that launches the following exec command, whenever a image file is dropped onto it (the exec print the image files with some printing params).  precodeexec('lpr -o ImageableArea=DS_8x6 -o PageRegion=DS_8x12 -o PageSize=DS_8x12 -o media=DS_8x12 '.$fullPathOfTheImageFile); /code/pre  How can I create this application? I can't go beyond this point:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xFUhM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126791> Change codeinput type/code in the upper left of the codeRun Shell Script/code block to codeas arguments/code. Then you can get the result of the previous block like it was passed to a shell script as argument. Example:  precodelpr -o ImageableArea=DS_8x6 -o PageRegion=DS_8x12 -o PageSize=DS_8x12 -o media=DS_8x12 $1 /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TagP8.png" alt="enter image description here"
