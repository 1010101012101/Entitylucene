macbook pro 15 inch retina, keyboard shortcut for desktop display <body> I have the latest MacBook Pro 15 inch with Retina display, strongOS 10.8.4/strong. Not wanting to use the standard kbdFn/kbd keys but use them as Apple has assigned them.   strongIs there a keyboard shortcut to display the desktop?/strong I find the finger drag on the trackpad literally a drag!  Thanks, Carin  <answer95821> kbdcmd/kbd-kbdF3/kbd works for me.  If you have emUse all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys/em turned on in System Preferences  Keyboard, then it would have to be kbdfn/kbd-kbdcmd/kbd-kbdF3/kbd.  <answer95823> ol liGo to System Preferences - Mission Control/li liAssign your own keyboard shortcut to Show Desktop. /li /ol
