Why do I see a list of MAC addresses in Reminders? <body> Having upgraded my iPad2 to iOS-5, I've now got the new strongReminders/strong app. When I open it, I see a list of MAC addresses on the left hand side under, "Yahoo!" (I assume it says "Yahoo!" because my Apple store email is Yahoo) and above, "Reminders".  What are these MAC addresses listed for?  Note: my iPad is not one of the listed MAC addresses.  Note 2: these Mac addresses also appear in my list of calendars!  <comment33089> Are the MAC addresses the namens of different lists? Look at the content then, maybe this is Reminders way of solving sync conflicts. <comment33095> @patrix: yes, they are different lists. <comment33103> Did you create the content of the different lists on different computers/devices? <comment33104> @patrix: no, though that is a logical thought. I create only test items for two of the eight lists. Both I created on the same device, my iPad2. I added these items to the lists only *after* I saw the MAC addresses.
