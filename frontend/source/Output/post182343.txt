Is there a way to connect to office VPN using parallels (windows) but surf on host Mac OS X? <body> My office VPN called Juniper does not gets installed on Mac OS X. I am using Parallels to run guest Windows on my macbook pro with OS X Yosemite. I don't know what I am asking, and if it is even logical or not, but here is my question:  Is there a way that I can share my guest operating system's VPN connection with host operating system? What I mean is, that I connect to my office VPN using my guest Parallels Windows OS and that can be shared with my host macbook Mac OS X?  By doing this what I want to achieve is, that I want to just open Windows using Parallels and then connect to my VPN and then minimize it and come back to OS X and then surf all my internet websites on Safari or Chrome (on Mac and not W indows).  Is this possible? Could anybody guide me on how to do this if its possible?  <answer182394> It sounds like I have similar hardware and software setup. Are you able to setup VPN through the Mac's system preferences?  ol liGo strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongNetwork/strong/li liAt the bottom-left, click 'strong+/strong' to create a new type of connection./li liFor the strongInterface/strong drop-list, choose strongVPN/strong/li liChoose the strongVPN Type/strong accordingly./li liConfirm that strongService Name/strong is meaningful for you./li liComplete the remaining fields according to your setup./li liTick the strongShow VPN status in menu bar/strong checkbox./li /ol  Once that's done, go to the menu bar and click the "VPN" icon and choose strongConnect/strong. If you want to manually end the session, then you'll be able to choose strongDisconnect/strong.  <answer182558> You may be able to share the connection from Windows to Mac, depending upon how it is implemented in Windows. Follow these steps, from this site:  ol liAdd a Host-Only network adapter to the guest (Windows)./li liLaunch the Guest (Windows)./li liGo to a command prompt and type:  precodeipconfig /all /code/pre  Note the IP Address of the Host Only adapter. Likely something like 10.37.129.2./li liemAssuming the VPN shows as a connection in Windows Network Connections/em, setup Internet Connection Sharing on this adapter. When setting up ICS, choose the Host Only adapter as the Private Network Adapter./li liOnce thatâ€™s done, connect to the VPN./li liOn the host, add a route to your VPN, specifying the IP address of the Host Only Adapter as the gateway. In this example, the subnet trying to be reached on the VPN is 192.168.40.0/24, and the IP address of the Host Only Adapter is 10.37.129.2, so in a Terminal window you would type the following:  precodesudo route -n add 192.168.40.0/24 10.37.129.3 /code/pre/li /ol  <comment217155> I don't know VPN type or Service name for my company's VPN. They do not share it, once I open a website, and login with my credentials they install a Juniper vpn software on my windows machine (it doesn't support Mac). But once my windows (parallels virtual desktop) is connected to vpn can I share this connection on mac as well? this is my question. <comment217413> By definition this setup can't work. A [host-only adapter](http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v4/docs/en/Parallels_Desktop_Users_Guide/22243.htm) connects to a closed internal virtual network with no internet connection. As a result you can't set up any working VPN connection to a VPN-server using this interface. You need at least a 2nd interface - probably a bridge to eth0/eth1 <comment217453> @tubedogg Thanks for your efforts for finding this information. Could you also share how to undo these changes if they don't wory? <comment217454> @klanomath could you please suggest a better way if it exists to do this? <comment276013> This solution did work for me. Just several notices: 1. after VPN connection established, I had to run "net stop sharedaccess & net start sharedaccess" 2. yes, another network connection should be added to guest machine, otherwise it has no internet connection 3. you have a typo in a "sudo route..." - gateway IP should be exactly  the same as guest IP
