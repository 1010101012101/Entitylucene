Install Yosemite ISO on VMWare Workstation 11 <body> I have a win 7 computer with vmware workstation 11 and I need to install Yosemite in it. I got the Yosemite OS iso after downloading the os in a mac from the appstore, as outlined in this guide (Official way to obtain an OS X ISO file). Now what I cant seem to find anywhere is how to create a vm with that iso. When I create a new vm in workstation it asks for the iso file, then I don't see the option to specify OSX as my OS in the wizard. Is there a way to create a vmx with this iso? Have any of you done this before?  Thanks  <answer175384> Mac OS X EULA/SLA doesn't allow to run Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware.  VMware Workstation - usually running on non-Apple hardware - adheres to this restriction and doesn't sallow/s offer the possibility to install Mac OS X (even if run in Bootcamp!).  Check sysprobs to get an impression how the OS X installation in VMware Workstation running in a Bootcamp environment on Apple hardware may work.  <comment206763> Suggest you read **2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.** of the [Apple SLA for OS X Yosemite](http://images.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/OSX1010.pdf) as what you're asking violates it and is not a permissible question here. <comment206766> ok, thanks, I'll do it the other way
