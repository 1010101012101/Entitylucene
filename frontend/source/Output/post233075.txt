Need my automator script to display the regular shutdown prompt before shutting down <body> I'm using the script below to trigger a shutdown but I would like it to give me the normal warning menu with the 60 sec. countdown, I can't figure out the warning menu.  precodetell application "finder" to shut down     /code/pre  I don't know what else to put so I get the normal shutdown prompt.  <answer233077> Use the menu item instead:  precodetell application "Finder" to activate tell application "System Events"     tell process "Finder"         click menu item "Shut Down…" of menu 1 of menu bar 1     end tell end tell /code/pre  If you use another system language than English use the proper shut down command instead. At least in OS X 10.11 you have to allow Script Editor/the resulting app to control your computer in System Preferences - Security - Privacy - Accessibility.  hr  You have to copy the menu item strongexactly/strong including spaces. E.g. the three dots are not three dots but an ellipsis: kbdalt/kbdkbd;/kbd - … (en-US keyboard layout)  <comment284894> idk how to do it exactly from Applescript, but if you set a key command to Shut Down... you could just key press that combo from the script. I'm not sure if you can key command the default Power Button or Ctrl/Eject, but you can if you use Keyboard shortcut prefs to assign a new command. <comment284920> The thing is that I'm using my Amazon Echo to trigger these commands so I can't use a button press. <comment284925> When I tried this it simply brought Finder to the forefront, it didn't activate the menu bar or anything else..  If I could even get it to automate the shortcut buttons that would be fine. <comment284926> @KyleHinkebein What's your system version? <comment284927> applescript will 'press the buttons' for you `keystroke x using command down` etc - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36943/how-do-i-automate-a-key-press-in-applescript - btw, klanomath is *always* worth listening to.. he's just tackling it from another angle right now, but equally if not more valid than my attempt. <comment284928> Works perfect!!!  I retyped it from my laptop to my main system and had those dots wrong.. Thanks!!!  Really appreciate it.. <comment284930> Thanks man, I appreciate the support, I'll definitely check out that link..
