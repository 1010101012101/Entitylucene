Extract jpeg File <body> Often files are hidden in code.jpg/code files simply by opening them up with 7zip, then closing them again. Mac OS X archive utility does not have this ability. Is there any software available for osx that does?  <answer126960> Actually all you need to do is change the file extension from .JPG or .JPEG to .zip. If it is indeed a zip file the O/S' unzip program should unzip it.  Failing that I use The Unarchiver  http://unarchiver.c3.cx  As a replacement for O/S X's built-in zip compression utility as it handles more formats.
