Compiling Ghostscript in El Capitan <body> I'm trying to compile Ghostscript-9.18 ( i need libgs ) and I've run into the new Rootless Security stuff when I try to install the libs. How do I change the target from /use/include to /usr/local/include? Do I need to change Makefile and rebuild everything?  Thanks  <comment266454> There will be an argument to configure that chnage it. run configure --help to see <comment266457> Why not just use homebrew to install ? Just wondering why you want to compile from source ? <comment266552> I found a solution, I manually copied the stuff to /usr/local. I don't know what homebrew is. I I know it has something to do with distributing open source code, I tried something call Fink once. I think it's similar. I like seeing a Makefile. Old fashioned I guess.
