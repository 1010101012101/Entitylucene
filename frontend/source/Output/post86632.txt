What happens when you have two connected network interfaces? <body> I have two connected network interfaces, ethernet and WLAN.  How does OSX handle traffic in this situation? When outgoing messages are sent which interface are they sent from? If I use tools such as Logmein.com, which interface does it connect through?  <answer86656> It depends on the service order set in System Preferences-Network. The first one that has a route to the requested endpoint will be used.  Click on the wheel icon at the bottom left and choose codeSet Service Order.../code. Then drag the items into the required order.  This is the order on m machine which I do not think I have altered.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5yth7.png" alt="enter image description here"
