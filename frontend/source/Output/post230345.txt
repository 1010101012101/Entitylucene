homebrew: how to tell if a formula is binary <body> How do I tell if a particular formula will be installed as binary of from source?  Is there a brew command for this?  <answer230451> You could use codebrew edit ${formula_name}/code. That will open an editor with the formula contents. If there is a reference to a "bottle", then installing it with default settings will use that.  However, if you add an option, then homebrew will compile the software for you.
