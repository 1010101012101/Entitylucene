Serious wifi disconnect problem on imac running os x lion latest <body> I'm having a serious problem with wifi on my imac 21.5inch running os x lion up to date. Everytime, it keeps disconnecting and then i reconnect it, then disconnect again, sometime it stays on for like an hour or 2 then disconnect again and sometime i have to restart my wifi modem. I check my phone, wifi stays on all the time but only my imac that keep disconnecting for no reason at all.   Is there anyway at all to fix this? I've tried to google and some answer i've already followed but none of them seems to work for me, so i thought i might try here see if any of you guys could help me with this problem.  It's so annoying when i'm trying to search or even just watch youtube videos and then it cuts off and on and off so many times.  Please help!   <comment62641> Which wifi router are you using? <comment62648> I use the one that was provided from an internet provider. telecom.co.nz <comment62854> No worries now. It's solved!
