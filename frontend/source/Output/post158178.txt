Is there a way to immediately exit a hanging connection in Terminal? <body> I often have SSH connections through Terminal that stop responding (like if I've left it overnight) but when I try to use the dead connection Terminal doesn't respond for several minutes until:  precodeWrite failed: Broken pipe /code/pre  Is there a way I can tell bash to immediately disconnect (because I know the connection is dead) without closing/opening a new window?  <answer158179> You can type  ~.  which ends the SSH connection. Normally it works immediately, but sometimes you may need to do it a few times.  <comment185981> Does CTRL+C not work for that? <comment186002> Agreed.  CTRL+C should work. <comment186110> Should of mentioned that CTRL+C and CTRL+D do not work. <comment186111> Control characters only send a signal to the application to be handled by the application. If the connection is dead the character waits to be sent like any other character typed. <comment186112> Worked perfectly first time for me :)
