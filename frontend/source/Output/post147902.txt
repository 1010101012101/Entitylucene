Browsing on Apple TV without mirroring? <body> I wonder if its possible to browser websites on Apple TV without having an iPod, iPhone or iPad to mirror from.  If Apple TV has a browser that I can use with my Bluetooth keyboard, that would be awesome. Is it possible yet?   Edited to Add: I haven't jailbroken my ATV yet, but I'm open to any solution that requires it.  <answer147903> There is no browser app for Apple TV itself. The best I've found so far is Airweb which of course still requires an iOS device. But it's easier to use than a mirrored Safari.  <comment174364> Ah, not possible even on jailbroken devices? <comment174365> Don't know about jailbroken ATVs. If you are open for such solutions it might be worth to mention this in the question.
