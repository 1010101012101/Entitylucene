Assign shortcut for "Look Up" in context menu <body> I'm looking for a way to assign a shortcut for the right click button emLook Up/em. So that I can just select some text and call that without using the mouse. Below is the pop-up that shows up when you look something up.  I'm aware of the em"Look Up in Dictionary"/em service and ability to assign a shortcut for that but it's not the same.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIH1A.png" alt="Look Up Pop Up"  <answer263575> You could try adding the keyboard shortcut for "Look Up in Dictionary"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wkUcK.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once you have that set, you can add a dictation command (assuming you have advanced dictation enabled) by just selecting any text and speak the phrase "make this speakable" which will open this dialog box..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x4zTI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Use what ever phrase you want, then select keyboard shortcut in the drop-down menu and enter in the same shortcut you set in your system preferences.  Now you have a keyboard shortcut and a dictation command
