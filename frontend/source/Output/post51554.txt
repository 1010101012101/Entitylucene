Error with MATLAB <body> I regularly use MATLAB from the command-line instead of launching the full graphical user interface. Ever since I made the last update of OS from 10.7.3 - 10.7.4, I started getting the following errors, whenever I would launch something with a graphical interface within MATLAB:  precodeMay 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextGetCTM: invalid context 0x0  May 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextSetBaseCTM: invalid context 0x0  May 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextGetCTM: invalid context 0x0  May 17 10:35:40 HOST_NAME MATLAB_maci64[549] &lt;Error&gt;: CGContextSetBaseCTM: invalid context 0x0 /code/pre  This is how I usually launch MATLAB from the command line:  precodematlab -nodesktop -nosplash /code/pre  Recently, I've read of other Java based applications with GUIs having the same problem. Just wondering if there is a quick fix for this.  ** This is becoming really annoying, I can't seem to find a solution, I'm using 2011a is anyone seeing this with a more recent version?  <answer51927> I can confirm having this problem with Matlab 2011a on Lion 10.7.4.  But fortunately it seems to be fixed in Matlab 2011b -- no more annoying CGContext errors.  So it's definitely worth it to grab a more recent version of Matlab.  <comment58937> We see the problem too with our Java desktop application.
