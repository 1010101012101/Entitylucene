That may allow you to do what you want.  <answer291595> i believe libimobiledevice is what you're looking for. github repo can be found here  it's a cross-platform lib talking to iDevices with no jailbrake needed. just use console command     $ idevicesyslog   you can install it via homebrew or compile from sources  strongmacOS install via homebrew/strong     $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"      $ brew install -v --devel --fresh automake autoconf libtool wget libimobiledevice      $ brew install -v --HEAD --fresh --build-from-source ideviceinstaller   stronglinux/strong     sudo apt-get update      sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice ideviceinstaller   <answer291613> Yes you can see iOS system logs from the the Mac command line.   Install Apple Configurator. It has an official helper tool to show the log files and perform other handy tasks.   precodecfgutil syslog /code/pre  The help command is quite useful and you can install it from the "Install Automation Tools..." menu item once you run Apple Configurator 2  <comment368126> Please explain what exactly this is, and what operations it performs to help the user. Things to include may be usage of the commands, what it accesses, and how it is relevant to the question - From Review <comment369198> XCode free by Apple provides a graphical interface to pull logs and other info from your device. It's not a way on the terminal but just another option :)
