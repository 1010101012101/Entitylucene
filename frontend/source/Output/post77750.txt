Calling a script right after opening a type of file? <body> Does any one of you know if it's possible to call a script right after opening a file.   For example : I want to relocate QuickTime in the top-left corner right next to my dock.   I  know how to do it with AppleScript (the location thing) but how can I call this script automatically ?   <answer78791> This is a bit of a hack, but try watching for changes to some file that is modified when the application opens a document.  Using launchd, you could save this as code~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist/code and run codelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/test.plist/code.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;test&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;          &lt;string&gt;osascript&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;try tell app "System Events" to tell process "QuickTime Player" set position of window 1 to {500, 500} end end&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;WatchPaths&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Users/username/Library/Preferences/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX.LSSharedFileList.plist&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  It won't work if you open multiple documents in a row, because launchd runs programs only at most every 10 seconds.  <answer101136> Have you tried this?  Do Something When - Project  It seems like what you want...I have never personally used it.  <comment91142> Yep it works but after 10 sec. But not very practical.
