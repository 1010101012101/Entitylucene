Google Chrome closing tabs instead of quiting application <body> When I click the close button on Google Chrome, it closes all tabs instead of exiting and remembering the open tabs on next launch. Any way to fix this ?   I expect the X button to close the app.  I can only do that if I select codequit/code (from menu or by keyboard shortcut).  <answer138865> That is the way most apps behave on Mac OS X.  The red x button in the corner of the screen closes the window, while choosing codeQuit/code from the menu or clicking kbdCommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd will close the app.  There is no way to em"fix this"/em because that is the way the app is meant to behave.  <answer138868>    When you click the codex/code Button, then the current window is getting closed.   A workaround to reopen the Tabs is via the Menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FE1qB.jpg" alt="Chrome File Menu"  So when you close the window via the red x button, strongChrome is still active/strong. You can then click on the dock icon, and then go to codeFile/code-codeMenu/code and click on codeReopen Closed Tab/code. Alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdT/kbd to quickly reopen closed tabs.  <answer139397> If you want chrome to remember the tabs which you closed, you can enable it in chrome settings by going to 'on startup' and choose 'continue where you left off'. When you open chrome, the closed tabs should open automatically.   <comment163803> what Chrome version is it ? what is your os x? which x do you use ? the one on the tab. <comment163809> + do you have any tab/window-related extensions? <comment163822> Macs work differently than Windows machines. It's just a matter of getting used to the differences.
