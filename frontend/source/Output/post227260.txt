Assigning a key to light up CM Storm Devastator keyboard problem <body> I followed the steps to make the CM Storm Devastator keyboard backlights turn on (using this tutorial). That is working. But, when I assigned a key to toggle the backlight, the backlight does not turn on. The key I have it assigned to is command+F14. I am on Yosemite.  <answer227278> First, check under: codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard/code and see if your "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" option is checked.  If the box is emnot/em checked, you will need to hold down codeFn/code as well - this means that it your keyboard combination should be codeFn+Cmd+F14/code.  If the box emis/em checked (which means pressing F1/F2 doesn't affect brightness, F11/F12 doesn't affect volume etc) then you may want to check your configurations and go over the steps in the tutorial again.  I hope this helps.
