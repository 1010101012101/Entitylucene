Want VBA code to make Excel Mac 2011 play sound file based on name in a cell <body> I'm trying to populate an Excel worksheet with controls that will play audio file examples of how to pronunce a list of words.  If the content of A1 is "introduce", I want Excel to play an audio file named introduce.m4a when (say) a button in B1 is pressed. I emdon't/em want the sound played by an external app or another browser window.   I've found a fair bit of VBA code that plays a sound triggered by events in an Excel worksheet, but none that gets the name of the audio file from a cell in the sheet.  precodeSub Playm4a()    Application.ScreenUpdating = False    On Error Resume Next    ActiveSheet.OLEObjects.Add(Filename:=ActiveCell.Text, Link:=True).Select    If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then      Application.ScreenUpdating = True      MsgBox "Could not play " &amp; ActiveCell.Text      Exit Sub    End If    Selection.Verb    Selection.Delete End Sub /code/pre  Thanks in advance for any help!  <answer274611> Found this question when tried to solve the similar problem (creating a vocabulary notebook for learning english words). The easiest solution for me was just to use built-in voice pronunciation in MacOS X:  precodeSub Pronounce_active_cell()     MacScript ("say " &amp; """" &amp; ActiveCell.Value &amp; """") End Sub /code/pre  <comment291943> Please add the relevant part of the code sample to the question. <comment292315> I don't have any code yet, because I don't know how to make the core part of the routine work. Suppose I have a sound file Macinosh HD/Users/David/Desktop/words/thanks.m4a and the content of cell  A1 is "Macinosh HD/Users/David/Desktop/words/thanks.m4a" What VBA code will cause that sound to be played? <comment292318> Your question says "I've found a fair bit of codeâ€¦" so I assume you already have code which plays a sound and are now looking for a way to replace the sound file used there by a path/file from a cell. How does this code look like? (Background: it's a lot easier to change existing macros than writing new ones from scratch) <comment292527> Yes indeed! It's easier to modify than start from scratch. But I don't know what needs to be modified in this:   Sub Playm4a()    Application.ScreenUpdating = False    On Error Resume Next    ActiveSheet.OLEObjects.Add(Filename:=ActiveCell.Text, Link:=True).Select    If Err.Number  0 Then      Application.ScreenUpdating = True      MsgBox "Could not play " & ActiveCell.Text      Exit Sub    End If    Selection.Verb    Selection.Delete End Sub <comment355453> Thank you, Vadim!  Works perfectly.  (Note: this approach works only for reading whatever is set as the system language: if you want Excel to read French properly, your Mac must be set so that all the menus, dialog boxes and so on are in French.)
