Need help finding out why a file (test_find.pyc) opens at startup <body> Like the title said, IDLE opens and runs  code/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/test/test_find.pyc/code every time I start my computer, but I can't figure out why. It's not normal behavior for other Macs, but that's the directory macOs uses for its internal python frameworks so I don't want to delete it.   The output it displays is usually garbage, i.e.:  precodeÑò ﾟWFXc /code/pre  And it takes almost a minute to run!  This behavior has persisted across multiple OS upgrades.  I'd like to try to track down what the heck is calling that file.  <answer273881> You could look in these locations if there is an alias to that. If not I would just delete the file.  precode/Library/StartupItems/ /Library/LaunchDaemons/ /Library/LaunchAgents/ ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ /code/pre  For LaunchAgents there could be a plist file related.  <comment344294> You should not delete things in /System as they have been installed by Apple <comment344305> Helpful answer, but unfortunately nothing in those folders referenced test-find.pyc. I think I'm just going to recursively grep my entire hard drive and let it run over night :/ <comment344315> The file test_find.pyc belongs to the python test_find.py. As far as I know python is still in version 2.6 along many updates. What happens when you run: `python /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/test/test_find.py` ? Running the `pyc` file should give a runtime error but not garbage. Just an idea but you could update to python 3, but I guess you really are not interested in other than to get rid of the startup issue. <comment344555> @Asle I've actually got python 3 installed along with IPython and some other stuff. I use it for physics homework. As for the command, it didn't work. `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python: can't open file '/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/test/test_find.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`. same thing with the pyc <comment344556> @Asle though the fact that the error message mentions python 2.7 is weird right? Like something is symlinked to the wrong thing? <comment344959> What does this output? `python -V` `python3 -V` `whereis python` `whereis python3` <comment344961> You have to run the file like above but with `python file_path`Did you do it? I see you did not include the ´python `command first? <comment346311> `python -v`should give you python 2.x and `python3 -v`should give you python 3.x. You could of course link /usr/bin/python to your python3. But I am not sure if that solve your original problem which was why this file is launching at startup.
