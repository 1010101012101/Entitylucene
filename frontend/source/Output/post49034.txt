Automator workflow or AppleScript to close Safari after a period of time <body> I would like to create an Automator workflow (or some similar function) that will close down Safari after a specified period of time.   For instance, I simply want to run Pandora in Safari during the night, but have it close out after 30 minutes to 1 hour, as sort of a sleep timer. I am a very new Mac user so detailed instructions would be great. I have familiarized myself with creating some simple Automator workflows, but I have no experience using AppleScript.  <answer49078> Here is the AppleScript code, which you can put in your workflow, by implementing an AppleScript item, and copy-paste the code in.  The time is configurable, but you need an exact sleep time, which I can add if you could elaborate some more on the time.  Here is the code via CulturedCode.  precodeglobal quit_after, check_every  set quit_after to 2700 set check_every to 10 set minute to quit_after / 60  display dialog "Check is performed every " &amp; check_every &amp; " seconds. Things will be quit after " &amp; minute &amp; " minutesof system inactivity."  on reopen     display dialog "Check is performed every " &amp; check_every &amp; " seconds. Things will be quit after " &amp; minute &amp; " minutes of system inactivity." end reopen  on idle     set idletime to do shell script "echo $((`ioreg -c IOHIDSystem | sed -e '/HIDIdleTime/ !{ d' -e 't' -e '}' -e 's/.* = //g' -e 'q'` / 1000000000))"     if (idletime as integer) &gt; quit_after then         tell application "System Events"             if ((name of processes) contains "Safari") then                 tell application "Safari" to quit             end if         end tell     end if     return check_every end idle /code/pre  <comment56165> Assuming you have regular sleeping hour (say 12am everyday), would it be better for you to schedule a sleep at 12:30am, to put the whole computer to sleep instead of just closing Safari? <comment56166> To schedule, go to System Preference - Energy Saver - Schedule. <comment56214> I'd thought of this, but for other reasons I typically only run my TimeMachine backup among other things during the night; would prefer not to put the machine to sleep <comment56358> This looks great so far - if you could edit it to quit after, say, 45 minutes I'd appreciate it. Thanks! <comment56359> Sure, no problem. <comment165180> How might I adapt this such that an Xserve system will only close the Safari instances associated with inactive user sessions, on a multi-user-session system?
