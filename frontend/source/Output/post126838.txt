Aufs mount alternative <body> What union mounts are available on OSX? I've been using Aufs on Ubuntu for the past few years without fail and I'm looking for something similar...  Basically, given n directories, merge the contents into another directory in real-time. Any changes to the mount directory does not affect the original paths, and the changes that were made are put into the furthest left path. This allows me to create a complex working directory of several repositories, while maintaining the history and integrity of those directories cleanly.  Example:  precodemount -t aufs -o br=/src1:/src2:/src3 none /path/to/stacked/dir /code/pre  Would combine codesrc1, src2/code and codesrc3/code into code/path/to/stacked/dir/code  <answer126850> I am not aware of any equivalent file system for Mac OS X.  The closest offering is the OSXFuse project, where developers can implement custom file systems in user space. OSXFuse mentions the following file systems, none of which rival aufs's capabilities:  ul lisshfs/li liprocfs/li liAccessibilityFS/li liGrabFS/li liLoopbackFS/li liSpotlightFS/li liYouTubeFS/li /ul  <answer145788> You can use the codeunion/code option available in OSX's codemount/code:  codesudo mount -t hfs -o union /dev/disk9s1 /tmp/union/code  See also: http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx/arch_fs.html
