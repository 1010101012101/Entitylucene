How can I kill the Jenkins process? <body> I have Jenkins running on my computer and occupying port 8080.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F10zI.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm unable to kill it.  Something like codeps -9 PID/code would kill the process, but Jenkins will restart with a different PID.  I thought maybe when Jenkins was started, there was also a user "codejenkins/code" created. I searched for that user in "emSystem Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/em" but I couldn't find it.  Any idea how I can terminate Jenkins? Maybe I need to delete the user "jenkins" ?  <answer272664> h2Launch daemons/h2  On macOS, Jenkins runs as a emlaunch daemon,/em or simply emdaemon,/em which is just a fancy name for a specific way to have a program run in the background. According to Apple’s developer reference, a daemon on macOS is:     [...] a program that runs in the background as part of the overall system (that is, it is not tied to a particular user).   Launch daemons are associated with a macOS-internal process called codelaunchd/code, which runs all the time. One of codelaunchd/code’s various responsibilities is to (re-)launch a daemon whenever it deems it necessary. This also explains the behavior you described that Jenkins seems to respawn on its own after it is forcibly sent the codeKILL/code signal.  h2Stopping and uninstalling Jenkins/h2  There is more than one way to stop a running Jenkins instance. As per the original documentation of the Jenkins installer for macOS, the following steps are the recommended way to terminate a Jenkins instance on macOS:  ol liOpen codeTerminal.app/code (you did that already; if not, type codeterminal/code into a Spotlight search field and hit kbdEnter/kbd)/li liIf you want to stop Jenkins only once, run the following command:  precodesudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.jenkins-ci.plist /code/pre/li liIf you would rather uninstall Jenkins altogether, also run the following command (including the single quotes):  precode'/Library/Application Support/Jenkins/Uninstall.command' /code/pre/li /ol  <comment342727> Yup, it made the HNQ.
