Apple Music on the Apple Watch shows music I deleted <body> I deleted some music I added to my library from Apple Music previously. Everything is good on iPhone &amp; in iTunes on the MacBook, but I still see all deleted items in the list of the default "Music" app on Apple Watch. If I open a band - I can see albums &amp; songs (on the next level), as it was before. I can't play music if I'll press any of that items, of course.  I tried to shutdown &amp; start Watch. Also, I have the last version of watchOS. I updated it having this problem, already. After that, nothing changed.  Could anyone give some advising, please?
