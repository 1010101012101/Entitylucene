What is the Default content in /private/etc/paths? <body> I have edited code/private/etc/paths/code to allow access for codeHomebrew/code:  precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  I want to restore this file to the system Defaults. What are the default lines and default order?  <answer215701> The default content of em/etc/paths/em until Mavericks is:  precode/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin /code/pre  The default content of em/etc/paths/em since Yosemite is:  precode/usr/local/bin /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /code/pre  <answer215702> In OS X 10.11 ( El Capitan ) the order and content of /etc/paths is:  precode /usr/local/bin  /usr/bin  /bin  /usr/sbin  /sbin /code/pre  Additionally, having installed Xquartz via MacPorts, I note the addition of one entry in /etc/paths.d/ called 40-XQuartz, which contains the following:  precode /opt/X11/bin /code/pre  As I recall, convention has it that /etc/paths is evaluated first, with any entries in /etc/paths.d being appended.  Some optional / additional package managers make modifications to either the .profile or .bashrc at the root level of your user's home directory.    Are you having problems with the PATH variable related to optional / additional package managers like home-brew?    Warm Regards,   F.  <comment260569> Thanks for your reply! The reason I wanted to revert to default is because I decided to export the path in `.bash_profile` instead via: `export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"`. I too have XQuartz installed, but I don't have `/opt/X11/bin` in `/private/etc/paths` nor `.bash_profile`. When running `which xquartz` it says `/opt/X11/bin/xquartz`. So I'm assuming that is appended from `etc/paths.d` automatically like you said.
