FakeLocation Tweak (Via Cydia) has shut down my iPad and it doesn't want to work <body> I downloaded a tweak via Cydia called FakeLocation. Once I downloaded it my iPad couldn't open again even if I charge it. Tried connecting it to iTunes on my PC to restore it but it doesn't want to connect because there's no battery. Any tips?  <answer125653> Try to turn it off and charge it with your wall charger.  Then boot it into DFU mode and restore it with iTunes.  <answer125656> You can boot into Substrate Safe Mode by strongholding the volume up button on boot/strong. This disables tweaks such as this which should let you get back in to the device and back in to Cydia to uninstall it.  <comment147048> i can't it's out of battery and if i tried to charge it. the boot logo will disappear and the Empty battery will show up again wich means it can't be used at all. <comment147049> wait! actually it worked!!!
