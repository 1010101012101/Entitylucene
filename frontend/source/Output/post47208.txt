Can I create two different Docks that I can switch back and forth between? <body> I have two different accounts right now - one for work, one for play. It helps me stay focused, and it's quite useful.  However, sometimes I don't really love switching back and forth between user accounts sometimes. Thus, I've thought up an idea: What if I had 2 different Docks that I could switch between with a keyboard shortcut?  Thus, my question: Can I create 2 different Docks with 2 different sets of apps on each of them that I can switch between with a keyboard shortcut?  Example: Dock 1 has Finder, Mail, Safari, iTunes, Chrome, Trash on it; Dock 2 has Finder, Firefox, Trash, Opera, and Dictionary on it. I press Command-Option-0 and it switches to Dock 2. I press it again and it switches to Dock 1.  <answer47210> You could use an Automator service or one of the global-keybaord-trigger apps to run a script that switches between two different Dock preference plist files and then relaunches the Dock.  precode#!/bin/sh #you'd have a dock-work.plist and dock-home.plist file   cd ~/Library/Preferences/  if [ -e dock-is-work.state ] ; then      rm dock-is-work.state     touch dock-is-home.state      #save changes to existing Dock setup     cp com.apple.dock.plist com.apple.dock-work.plist      #copy home setup to main preference location     cp com.apple.dock-home.plist com.apple.dock.plist else     rm dock-is-home.state     touch dock-is-work.state      #save changes to existing Dock setup     cp com.apple.dock.plist com.apple.dock-home.plist      #copy work setup to main preference location     cp com.apple.dock-work.plist com.apple.dock.plist fi  osascript -e "tell application \"Dock\" to quit" /code/pre  sub(I haven't done bash if-then-else in awhile, so this might not execute as is.)/sub  <answer47211> You can use DockSpaces. (They just switched to a paid app, but you can download a free older version on Softpedia).  Dockspaces allows you to have up to 10 different docks that you can switch back and forth with hotkeys (kbdCommand/kbd + kbd1/kbd, kbdCommand/kbd + kbd2/kbd, etc.). I found it to be a really great app and really easy to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eD87Z.png" width="320" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2eqlI.png" width="320"  <comment54149> I normally don't go for paid solutions, but this one looks interesting & useful. Hmm...
