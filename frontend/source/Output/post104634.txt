safari website requires a client certificate <body> I went to a site I regularly use and got this when logging in with Safari  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCYNY.png" alt="enter image description here"  I seem to have 2 certificated of the same name both issued by Apple and both are not expired (found by searching in KeyChain Access app)  I evaluated at the certificates in Keychain Access and both have a status of good and the keychain they are in verifies OK.  How do I login, what are the risks in choosing the wrong one?  <comment123095> It's just a case of Duplicate certificates, choose any one and go forward! <comment123098> @killswitch - any reference to back up that assertion and also how did it happen?
