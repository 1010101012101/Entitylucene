Numbers spreadsheet can't be imported <body> I have a spreadsheet I have been updating in IOS Numbers for several months and I sometimes update it with OSX Numbers  However when I did a recent update in OSX I get the error message codeSpreadsheet couldn't be imported. An error occurred/code when I tried to open in IOS. This as the first time I edited in OSX since the iPhone was upgraded to IOS7.  I have edited the spreadsheet down so that it is just a simple table - to make sure that my recent edits had not caused an incompatibility.  I have looked at the problem spreadsheet in iCloud and it seems OK.br I also got a backup via Time Machine on OSX of before I opened it in OSX and that is openable in IOS  The errors Occur with Numbers '09 2.3(554) on OSX 10.8.5 and Numbers on IOS 7.0.2   How can I find out what is causing the error (and then fix it)  <answer104613> I had the same problem. A hard reset of my iPad (press and hold both the home button and the power button until the device turns off, then wait while it reboots) solved the issue.  <answer110614> Also I have had the same problem and had to convert the file for it to work. See my workaround here: http://goo.gl/CKgDaV  Hope this works for you too. :)  <comment122909> What version / OS combination now works and what fails? Did you try logging into http://iCloud.com to see if the file is corrupt in the cloud store? <comment122912> Why the -ve downvote - the question is how do I debug it? <comment130289> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
