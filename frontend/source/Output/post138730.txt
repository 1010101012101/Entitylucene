All my Time Machine windows are black <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vyWfy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That was supposed to be my finder window with my backups over time but I only see black screens. :(  <answer138731> Go to Finder and select your Time Capsule in the Shared list in the sidebar. Browse to the sparse bundle that contains your backups and mount it, then give it a few seconds and open Time Machine.  <comment163674> That sort of did it. Many thanks George! <comment172335> @grgarside I just encountered the same problem.  Is this a known issue? <comment172340> @Thorbj√∏rn Yes I believe it is. I haven't experienced the problem in 10.10 though.
