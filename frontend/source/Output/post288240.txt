Getting Messages sent to my sister's iPhone on my MacBook Air <body> My sister and I both have iPhones and whenever someone texts her, I get those messages sent to my MacBook Air. It's really annoying and I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it!  <answer288242> If it is not a bug, probably her iPhone and your MacBook are connected with the same Apple ID account. Just log out from her Apple ID in "System Preferences  Internet Accounts" and from "System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Your Mac Account  Advanced settings  Change Apple ID".
