Can you upgrade the RAM in the latest MacBook Airs if you ship them to Apple themselves? <body> I know that RAM is soldered onto the mainboard on the latest MacBook Airs, which makes a DIY upgrade apparently impossible. But would Apple do it instead though?  The guy at the Apple Store told me that I could send the Mac back to Apple and they could upgrade the RAM, but he didnâ€™t look very convinced if I must be honest, so I wanted to double check here.  <answer169457> Apple will replace the motherboard. The RAM is not desoldered and replaced, but the motherboard is simply swapped for one with the amount of RAM you want.  <comment199145> The question as asked has been answered below. I've removed the comments regarding Apple's price policy regardig the upgrade, please use our chat room to discuss this further.
