Can I compile .NET C# code on my Mac? <body> I need a way to cross compile a short piece of .NET C# code to a dll, which will then run a client's Windows environment.  I run OS X 10.9.2 on an iMac.  Does anyone know what tools allow this?  I would rather not install Parallels and Windows if I can find a way to cross compile this without needing that heavy of an installation of Microsoft tools.  <answer129431> No personal experience with this IDE but this looks like it will work: http://monodevelop.com  <answer129432> Check out the Mono Project. It may be what you are looking for.  http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:OSX  MonoDevelop is a cross-platform IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages. MonoDevelop enables developers to quickly write desktop and ASP.NET Web applications on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. MonoDevelop makes it easy for developers to port .NET applications created with Visual Studio to Linux and Mac OSX maintaining a single code base for all platforms.  <answer237126> If you have a Mac you can compile C# like this:  Compile: codemcs fileName.cs/codebr Run: codemono fileName.exe/code  If you don't have Mono installed on your Mac, you can google it and install it and then you will be good to go. You don't need Windows to do this.  <comment151473> http://monodevelop.com/   MonoDevelop is a cross-platform IDE primarily designed for C# and other .NET languages.

It goes both ways, too - a DLL/EXE compiled on Visual Studio will run unmodifed on Mono, given that you don't use any specific Microsoft/Windows libraries such as WPF, Workflow Foundation, COM+ etc. <comment151544> @Jagra: Once you install Mono (and MonoDevelop if you want it) from http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html, it's very easy to use. Even without MonoDevelop, you _should_ be able to compile most .sln projects straight from Visual Studio, using `xbuild`. <comment175712> Can you use this alongside developers who are using Visual Studio?
