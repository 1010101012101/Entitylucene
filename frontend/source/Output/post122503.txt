How to open shell scripts in editor when double clicking on them <body> I'm trying to migrate to OS X. One thing what I find really strange / dangerous that by double clicking on shell scripts, I launch them in Terminal.  I would like to change this behaviour to open them in Sublime Text.  My problem is that while I can do it to single files using the "Get Info" dialog, I cannot apply "Change All..." for these kind of files.  For other filetypes it worked OK, but for .sh / Unix Executable File I cannot assign them.  When I click, I get the following error dialog: The operation can't be completed. An unexpected error occurred (error code -50).   <answer122637> Install duti by running codebrew install duti/code, save a file like  precodecom.apple.TextEdit public.unix-executable all /code/pre  as code~/.duti/code, and then run code/usr/local/bin/duti ~/.duti/code. After that executable scripts with no filename extension should be opened in TextEdit.  Another option is to run codeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist/code, open the plist in a text editor, add an entry like  precode&lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;LSHandlerContentType&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;public.unix-executable&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;LSHandlerRoleAll&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.apple.TextEdit&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  under codeLSHandlers/code, and then restart to apply the changes.  The default application for shell scripts with a code.sh/code extension can be changed from Finder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0NhvJ.png" alt=""  <comment142953> I don't know why you are getting error code -50, I tried it on my system and it worked perfectly fine.  Look at this post to use Terminal to do it: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/91558/49601 <comment143149> Yes, that's the button which didn't work for me (error code -50). But duti works fine.
