How to improve spell check in OS X <body> When I write a letter my workflow is like this.  I type sentence.  Some words end up underlined red.  I right click on the underlined words and select the correct spelling.  The problem is that the quality of suggestions that I get is really low.  Often, the correct spelling is not suggested even though it's one or two edit operation away.  When I paste the same misspelled word into google, it finds the correct spelling immediately.  That, of course, is prohibitively time consuming.   I mean, if general search the internet performs better, the built in algorithm is really awful  So, how can I improve the quality of spelling suggestions?  Is there a way to plug in a different algorithm or a different dictionary?   <answer286854> A possible alternative is Spellcatcher X.  http://www.rainmakerinc.com/products/spellcatcherx/  <comment362073> What apps are you talking about?  Office and some others use totally different stuff than what apple provides.
