Color changing of the window title bar <body> Is it possible to change the color of the window title bar (possibly with Terminal.app) like in Firefox?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gungU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer186229> If you would like a GUI, then CrystalClear might be for you.
