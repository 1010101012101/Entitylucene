MySQL Server has randomly periodic connect problems <body> During the day (at development) the local MySQL server throws randomly the "MySQL Server gone away" error message to the PHP MySQL driver.  If I try to connect via the mysql console client, it works. But MySQL Workbench does also not connect to the server.  This seems to be a nasty bug that can be adressed to Mac OS X, because I found some similar error reportings (and a MySQL Mac OS X platform bug). But this should be fixed with version 5.5 or 5.6 I think. I am using 5.7 and this error should not again appear, but for some reason it does currently.  To fix this, I created a my.ini under /etc with the following content:  precode[client] port=3306 socket=/tmp/mysql.sock  [mysqld] port=3306 socket=/tmp/mysql.sock key_buffer_size=32M max_allowed_packet=16M max_connections=50 max_user_connections=10 wait_timeout=300 interactive_timeout=300 max_allowed_packet=64M table_open_cache=250 table_open_cache_instances=10 open_files_limit=5000 query_cache_size=0 max_allowed_packet=128M /code/pre  I have installed the official MySQL Mac Paket from mysql.com, not the homebrew one.  In most of the cases the database server is unreachable after mysqldump was executed. And sometimes phpstorm seems to cause the crash.  Any suggestions or tips about this would be great. Would save me a bit of time for often restarting the daemon.
