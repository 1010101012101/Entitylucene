How to read my old deleted iPhone WhatsApp messages from PC/Mac? <body> I deleted some important messages seven days ago and want to recover them. How can I undo my mistake and how can I read the data from my PC/Mac?  <answer278362> Did you try logging into WhatsApp for Mac?  <comment350260> where were they before you deleted them? If not on that device, then unlikely. <comment350317> i deleted that from my iphone <comment350318> i tried... those message is not there <comment350320> Probably gone, then, unless you can somehow access online. Data deleted from a hardware encrypted device is really gone. <comment350410> A feature of whatsapp is that it's super encrypted. Not sure if there's anything you can do
