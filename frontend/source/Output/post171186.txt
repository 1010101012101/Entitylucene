installing windows 8 on mac <body> I am trying to install windows 8 on my mac osx yosemite using boot camp. I created the bootable usb myself and will download windows assistance software later.So I ticked gthe last option only. Problem is when the system reboots for installing windows it is not accepting the partition which was earlier created for windows. I have even tried formatting it from windows setup. How to solve this issue?
