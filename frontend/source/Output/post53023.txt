How do I configure an .osx file? <body> I have found the following repository on GitHub...  https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx  ...that has some useful environmental settings I would like to adopt.  It appears they go into a .osx file.  Where is this file located?  Also, when does it 'run'?  Do I have to reboot the machine to get the settings in this to be recognized?  <answer53028> That looks like a shell script that is missing the shebang at the top of the file.   It could be that it is intended to be copied into an existing script to provide OS X-specific functionality so the main script can be portable (I'd expect there to be dotfiles for other operating systems, as well.)  On the other hand, it could be intended as a file of ideas and you pick the ones you want and paste them into your code.bashrc/code or code.bash_profile/code.  <answer53059> Select settings that look interesting, paste them in a terminal, and then quit and reopen applications to try them out.  You might also save the whole script as for example code~/.osx/code and then run codebash ~/.osx/code in a terminal. It includes commands for things like changing the computer name though.  The defaults commands modify files like code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code, and you only have to run them once. Adding them to .bash_profile would only make your shell startup time longer. You might keep a personal file like .osx though in case you make a clean installation of OS X. And for example codechflags nohidden ~/Library/code has to be run again after every OS X update.  I have a file like .osx only for settings that can't be changed from the UI (defaults.txt). I think it's easier to transfer settings to new OS X installations by recreating them manually, by copying the plist files, or by using Migration Assistant.
