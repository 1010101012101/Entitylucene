How do I change the settings of the sounds in iOS 6? <body> As you see. I have accidentally pressed something that change my iOS sound. When I try to volume up or down my sounds. It says sound effects. If I watch a video. It does not say anything. Is it in the iOS or did press anything? If I did, please help me.   <answer70010> Try going to Settings  Sounds and setting 'Change with Buttons' to Off.  <comment81267> Have you tried tapping the screen once while a video is playing, and dragging the volume slider (at the bottom) all the way to the right, so that it's all blue?
