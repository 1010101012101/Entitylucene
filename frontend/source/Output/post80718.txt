How to use automater to run mongo db and node.js app on startup <body> I'm trying to use Automater(first attempt of using this software) to create a sequence that will automatically run ./usr/mongo/bin/mongod and ./usr/mongo/bin/mongo then run my node.js server app at usr/node/app.js on startup  Currently I am able to run ./usr/mongo/bin/mongod using automater by using the Run Shell Script option. After that however the script fails  My script is as follows.  code./usr/mongo/bin/mongod/code code./usr/mongo/bin/mongo/code code/usr/node//code codenode app.js/code  Could you please help me solve this issue?  <answer80731> Trybr code./usr/mongo/bin/mongod; ./usr/mongo/bin/mongo; /usr/node/app.js/codebr instead.br As was mentioned by @Gerry, you should specify complete paths.  <comment93116> '.' means relative to the current directory, while you probably want to specify the path of relative to the root '/'. <comment93117> @Gerry I added ./ to run the mongod shell script <comment153092> Have you consider creating a launch agent instead? <comment164041> What does "on startup" mean for this script? When you run it? When you log in to your user? When any user logs in? Or as a service before any user necessarily logs in but once the machine has started running programs in the background?
