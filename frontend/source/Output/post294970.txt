Setting a compression limit for the in-memory swap compression <body> I want to limit the amount of compressed memory in my computer's swapping system.  Right now, when the system is in heavy usage, the OS will try to have 10 GB of compressed swap in memory, leaving me with only 6 GB of available memory.  Reading the source code for the compressor https://opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2422.1.72/osfmk/vm/vm_compressor.c.auto.html I see this:  precodePE_parse_boot_argn("vm_compression_limit", &amp;vm_compression_limit, sizeof (vm_compression_limit)); /code/pre  What do I need to do to provide this -- a read of the source code seems to indicate that I can use this to set a lower maximum in-memory compressed swap.  (Sadly, there is no way to get Apple's code to understand "adjust the amount of compressed swap based on working set size of the active processes". You have to set the maximum based on your worst case usage pattern).
