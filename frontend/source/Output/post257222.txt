Displaying Only Specific Gmail Labels in Mail? <body> I have a gmail account which I use regularly on one device, but I have a label for priority messages that I'd like to receive on all my other devices.  One of these devices is a Mac, and I'm setting the account up in Mail, however I don't want to display messages that do not use my priority label. Is this possible?  There's some crossover with this question: How to sync one or two labels only, from Gmail to Mail.app?  However, the accepted answer to that applies the filter to strongall/strong IMAP connections which isn't suitable, as I only want to limit one (I use IMAP for main device too, so I can't limit all IMAP connections).
