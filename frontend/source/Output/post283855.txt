VMWare Fusion and moving between monitors <body> I'm running a Windows 2012 guest in VMWare Fusion 8.5.6 on my Macbook pro.  The VM itself is fine but the problem is: at work, my secondary display is a high-density Samsung, where I need things scaled up in the guest to be able to see them, but at home I use a standard-density Acer, where (at 200%) the text is enormous.  Is there a way for Fusion to auto-scale the guest based on the attached monitor?    <answer284005> With the help of Autofit command of view menu you can resize the guest display resolution. There are four commands listed below:  ol listrongFit Guest Now -/strong Guest operating system display size to match current Workstation console./li listrongFit Window Now -/strong The Workstation console to match the current display size of the guest operating system./li listrongAutofit Window -/strong Workstation console to maintain the size of the virtual machine's display resolution./li listrongAutofit Guest -/strong Virtual machine to resize the guest display resolution to match the size of the Workstation console./li /ol  As per your requirement, Fit Guest Now command will remain the best.
