change sudoers to stop asking for password when running a systemsetup comman <body> To what exactly do I need to change sudoers file to prevent asking for password when I change system time zone?  This is the command I am going to run:  precodesudo systemsetup -settimezone timezone /code/pre  I know I need to change it, but I feel uncomfortable changing sudoers on my own due to not knowing exactly what I am doing.  <answer239610> Was brave enough to do it myself. For future readers, add:  precodeyourusername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/systemsetup /code/pre  after   precode## User privilege specification ## root ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  <answer239613> To enable passwordless sudo for emall/em admin users on the machine:  ol liRun codesudo visudo/code/li liChange the line reading code%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL/code to code%admin  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD ALL/code/li liSave changes (press Escape, type :wq! at the command prompt and hit enter)./li /ol
