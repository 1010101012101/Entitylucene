Music streaming stops when monitor shuts off (last.fm) <body> I'm using the last.fm scrobbler desktop app.  My mac is set to turn off the screen after 4 minutes, once this happens my music stops, not entirely. It's like my internet is no longer contiguous when the monitor isn't on.  any music played locally through itunes will work fine without the monitor on.  Just wondering if anyone has a way around this. I could use caffeine to force the monitor to stay on, but I don't want to do this.  thanks all!
