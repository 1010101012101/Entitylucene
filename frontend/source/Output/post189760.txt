iTunes movie player loses focus when iPhone starts syncing <body> Frustrated by years of iTunes for Windows quirks, I finally bought a Mac Mini as a sort of media server and moved all my iTunes content over, including wifi-syncing my iPhone and iPads. I figured that iTunes would work better on a Mac.  Nope! Now, when watching a movie full screen, iTunes pops back up into the foreground whenever a device starts syncing. And the movie viewer can't be found again -- I guess it's on a different desktop?   Is this just a bug? Is there a workaround? Seems pretty odd that iTunes can't play movies full screen if there are iOS devices in the house. Surely that's not a design choice?  <answer189784> The follwoing setting should do it.  iTunes  Preferences  Advanced:   Check "Keep movie player on top of all other windows"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7PeNd.png" alt="itunes"  <comment225139> did you enable in itunes pref the keep movie on top? <comment225150> You called it. If you want to post that as an answer I'll accept it. Grumbling in the comments: Why on earth would I *want* my little sync window to interrupt me while I watch a movie?? Surely that's not what the option was intended for! <comment225330> Whoops! Turns out that this doesn't work after all -- the little "sync window" *still* forces the iTunes library to the foreground, even when this option is set.
