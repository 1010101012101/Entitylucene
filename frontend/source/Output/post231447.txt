Is it normal to have a hidden file named .file in /? <body> I searched google and found a list of hidden directories and files in OS X at http://www.westwind.com/reference/OS-X/invisibles.html but .file wasn't listed.  The file is 0 size and looks like this  precode----------   1 root  admin        0 Aug 24  2013 .file /code/pre  very suspicious?  Running McAfee virus scan there were over 700 additional files that were Not Scanned because they were protected.   ul li/private/var  /li li/private/etc  /li li/Library/Caches  /li li/Library/Application Support and others/li /ul  <answer231451> Yes it's normal and the code.file/code file is part of the strongBaseSystemResources.pkg/strong and strongEssentials.pkg/strong packages within the strongInstallESD.dmg/strong disk image of the strongInstall OS X $version.app/strong bundle, e.g. strongInstall OS X Mountain Lion.app/strong, however I do not know its purpose.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MpeWx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231454> You can query the package receipt database.  precodepkgutil --file-info /.file /code/pre  on a machine running OS X 10.6 the results are  precodevolume: / path: /.file  pkgid: com.apple.pkg.BaseSystem pkg-version: 10.6.0.1.1.1249291854 install-time: 1252683091 uid: 0 gid: 80 mode: 0  pkgid: com.apple.pkg.Essentials pkg-version: 10.6.0.1.1.1249291854 install-time: 1252683099 uid: 0 gid: 80 mode: 0 /code/pre  <comment282656> I have `.file` as well, dating January 31st. May be just a leftover from an installer. <comment282668> Do not spend money on useless anti virus hoaxware. <comment282718> I have .file as well on my Mac (running El Capitan) and my 2 jailbroken devices running iOS 6.1 and iOS 9. <comment282724> Side question: is it possible for an empty file to be malicious?
