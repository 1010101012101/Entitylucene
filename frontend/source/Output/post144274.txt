Copy theme from Keynote '09 into Keynote 6.2.2 <body> I have both versions of Keynote running. I'd like to use a theme that exists in '09 in the newer Keynote, but that theme was dropped. How can I copy or import the theme from '09 into 6.2.2?  I have searched for answers and found instructions for importing purchased themes, but not for importing from an older version of Keynote.
