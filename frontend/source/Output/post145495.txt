Screen recording on iPad 1: what are the options without jailbreak? <body> AppStore requests a demo video for my app, but at the moment all I have is an iPad 1 with iOS 5 on it. They don't accept a video recorded in a simulator.  Buying a newer iPad is one obvious option, unless there are others.  Any ideas? Thanks.  <comment171490> do you have a Mac?, since iOS do not allow screen recording. <comment171491> Not sure you need a video recorder or just screen captures. <comment171503> @Buscarì›ƒ I suppose what the Review Team needs is a screen capture. <comment171504> Then you have your answer, just take a series of screen captures.
