How do you install a graphics card on mac pro 1,1? <body> Howdo you install a Radeon 6000 series graphics card on mac pro 1,1?  <answer136076> There's nothing to install since OS X has the drivers predelivered. You pull out the old one and stick in the new one. https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac+Pro+Graphic+Card+for+Mac+Pro+(Early+2008)+Replacement/14161  <comment161327> like specifically anything from the Radeon 6000 series <comment161415> It depends on which version of OS X if it's not a Mac GPU. <comment161416> Is this a "Mac" GPU or a common one for BIOS-based PCs? I remember reading that the Mac Pro 1,1 is limited when it comes to using BIOS-based GPUs. <comment161747> Thanks, so does this process work for the mid-2006 model as well as the early-2008 model?
