Is there any way to get the audio data that is going to the headphone jack or speakers? <body> I want to write an audio visualizer that I can run off of any audio data playing on my Mac Book Pro. Is there any way to get this data internally?  <comment358145> Have you heard of/looked at Soundflower? This isn't an answer because I don't know if it has the capabilities you are looking for, but it's worth checking out. <comment358146> I also think that Soundflower will do the job. You can create an aggregate device with Soundflower + Built-in Output, then connect your audio visualizer to the Soundflower output. <comment358180> Have a look at https://developer.apple.com/reference/avfoundation <comment358235> Soundflower might be a good option, unfortunately I don't have time to read through the docs for either that or avfoundation right now.
