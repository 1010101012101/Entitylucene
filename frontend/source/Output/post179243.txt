Is there an app that will show me total word count across all applications over a period of time? <body> Does anyone know of an application or service that I can enable that will log and record a count of the total number of words that I've typed over the course of a day?  I don't want or need a full keyboard log of all words, and I certainly don't want any of that being stored. I just want to know how many words and characters I've typed over the course of the day, irrespective of application.  <answer179276> Mac Word Counter should help you.  From the above-linked splash page:     The Word Counter …      gives immediate feedback on your productivity as a writer.      encourages you by showing you your daily output.      gives you clarity about your daily goals.      keeps a complete history of your daily achievements.      assists with finding your perfect writing environment.      counts what counts: words – the ultimate metric for writing.   <comment212442> For backstory: I'm the lead engineer of a company that has workers primary working remotely, and we handled a few crazy crises today and I feel like I've typed 20,000 words today (including all of these). I'd like to count and log all of these words and keypresses and hopefully chart them. <comment212516> Thank you so much. This app is perfect. I bought it. Excellent suggestion.
