How do I do "Hey Siri" on Mac? <body> On iOS, you can activate the Hey Siri feature in Settings and call out "Hey Siri" at any time to activate Siri without pressing a button. How can I do the same thing on a Mac running macOS Sierra?  <answer273229> I followed this guide and it works great.  ol liOpen Settings and enable dictation in keyboard settings. Make sure to check "Used Enhanced Dictation"(you may need to download something)/li liGo to Settings  Accessibility  Dictation(under interacting)/li liCheck "Enable the dictation keyword phrase" Enter whatever you want in the text box underneath it. To use "Hey Siri", type "Hey" in the box. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BauIo.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick on "Dictation Commands"/li liCheck "Enable Advanced Commands"/li liClick on the plus that appears./li liFill it in just as the image is. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lcMFw.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liIf you want (and I recommend you do), uncheck all the other boxes as you might accidentally active one of those commands without meaning to./li /ol  <answer273235> Once enhanced dictation is enabled, all that needs to be done is enable Siri in your system preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AT6ig.png" alt="enter image description here"  There is no need to add an additional dictation command because the dictation command is already there set up and ready to go in the "System Commands"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V8DWq.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to use the phrase "Hey Siri" to launch Siri on the computer, creating a new command is an option. The only problem with that is, what if your iPhone and computer are sitting close together? Using the phrase "Hey Siri" will launch Siri on both devices. My thought is that it is probably a good idea to use different commands for each device  <comment343487> I've edited the post and I removed the "I will answer this myself" part of the question but the OP will still like you to know, this is a self-answered question. <comment343651> @owlswipe thanks
