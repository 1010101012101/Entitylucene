Anyone able to connect gioteck VX-1 (PS3 controller) via Bluetooth? <body> I have a Sony DUALSHOCK 3 SIXAXIS controller, I can use it as a USB controller on my OS X Mountain Lion MacMini and it works perfectly.  I have it set up in Bluetooth so that when it is not connected via USB, I just press the Playstation Logo and it connects instantly via Bluetooth.  In my humble opinion, Sony DUALSHOCK 3 SIXAXIS controllers are overpriced, so I bought a gioteck PS3 VX-1 Wireless Controller for $29.99.   It is identical in every way to the Sony controller except the shape and that it doesn't come with a lithium ion battery and instead takes two AA batteries or a battery pack like the ones you put in an XBox 360 controller.  The "Cheap" controller works identical to the Sony controller when connected via USB.  My goal here is to play four player games with the whole family without spending nearly $200 on PS3 controllers.  The problem (I think): gioteck did not properly set the values transmitted via Bluetooth upon connection. The Bluetooth Type is "Unknown" instead of "Peripheral", the Name is "PLAYSTATION(R)3Conteroller-ghic" instead of "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller", the Services are not set instead of "PnP Information Wireless Controller", the Major Device Class is "0x1f" instead of "0x5", the Minor Device Class is "0x0" instead of "0x2", and as expected the Product ID and Vendor ID are different from the Sony.  My guess is that most of the details I listed above don't come from the Bluetooth device itself but are looked up based on Major Device Class and Minor Device Class (but I really don't know much about how Bluetooth devices work).  So my question:  Anybody know if there are files on my OS X 10.8 that I can modify so that my "Cheap" PS3 controller that works via Bluetooth on the PS3 can also work via Bluetooth on OS X?  Here are all the details I have:  The one that works:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PSFI5.png" alt="Working DUALSHOCK 3 SIXAXIS"  The one that doesn't work:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FdxDF.png" alt="gioteck VX-1 Wireless"  <answer75899> Ok, I got it to work.  I would not recommend using this technique, but it works, I hope someone posts a better solution.  Set up gioteck VX-1:  ol liGet a Sony controller and set it up (See Next Section, if you don't have a Sony controller, you can copy my values, which may work, just remember that the steps below will be slightly different since you will be copying details from this thread instead of from your Sony controller)/li liFollow same instructions as in Step 1, but using your gioteck VX-1 instead of your Sony controller, write down the gioteck's address as soon as it is displayed./li liBring up terminal and type:  precodecp /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist cp /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist.backup /code/pre/li liOpen your ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist in Xcode/li liExpand HIDDevices/li liClick on HIDDevices/li liClick on the (+) to the right of HIDDevices/li liIn Item 0's Value column type the Address you wrote down in step 2/li liSave and close the file/li liTurn Bluetooth off/li liType the following in Terminal:  precodesudo cp ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist cd /Library/Preferences sudo chown root:wheel com.apple.Bluetooth.plist /code/pre/li liTurn Bluetooth back on./li liPress the big round middle button on the VX-1 (where the Playstation logo would be on a Sony control)/li liYour controller should connect now automatically without asking you to enter a passcode to pair, but it won't work as a game controller at this point and after less than a minute, it will disconnect, but at least you know that you have done all the steps correctly so far if it doesn't prompt you for a passcode and it is listed even when the status is "Not Connected"./li liBring up System Preferences-Bluetooth.  You should now have PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller listed (the Sony controller), and PLAYSTATION(R)3Conteroller-ghic list (the VX-1)/li liClick on the Sony controller in the list (if you don't have a Sony controller, as stated in step 1, just know you will use details from this thread instead of from your Sony controller)/li liWrite down your Sony's Address/li liOpen ~/com.apple.Bluetooth.plist in Xcode again/li liExpand DeviceCache/li liNow, expand your VX-1's address (mine was 00-0e-3d-de-c9-19)/li liExpand your Sony's address (mine was 34-c7-31-1b-2b-e7)/li liNow drag the nodes of you VX-1 one by one to match the order of your Sony nodes (just to make them easier to compare) as you compare their values, when you encounter that your VX-1 is missing a node, right click the node within Sony, click copy, then right click your VX-1 and click paste. Then drag your newly pasted node within your VX-1 so that the order of your VX-1 nodes match the order of your Sony nodes (again, this is just to help you not miss anything).  While you compare and note the differences mentally, don't change any VX-1 values yet, your just copying missing nodes from Sony at this point./li liNow that the address nodes for your Sony and VX-1 contain the same number of nodes in the same order as each other, note that the following in your VX-1 should match your Sony exactly:  precodePageScanMode           Number  0 InquiryRSSI            Number  0 PageScanPeriod         Number  0 SupportedFeatures      Data    &lt;80001808 7a8207fc&gt;

There are specific addresses (blocks of numbers) that are highlighted red in your example. Are those the addresses we need to copy from the sony device cache into the vx-1's info? I am working with a generic controller that says "DUAL SHOCH II" on the back, labelled as "HK Black Wireless Bluetooth Controller for Sony PS3 bulk packaging" on amazon <comment118330> Thanks for this - an excellent answer. For reference, I also had to add the controller's address to the `PairedDevices` section in `com.apple.Bluetooth.plist` to get the request for a pairing code to stop appearing. <comment161175> Any idea on hoy to find the device's address on Mavericks? The Bluetooth preference pane no longer shows the device info. <comment356152> Many thanks for sharing your findings. For me it worked also with a Prif Kontrol 3 controller. It was enough to just add the missing "Services" key with the value provided by you. <comment356153> @Reven just press and hold the option key (alt) and than click on the bluetooth icon on the menu bar. The device info should now display the address.
