How to export iBooks Author .ipa file to ePub <body> iBooks Author 2.5  precodeBlank ePub template. Import file.  Make corrections. Save. Now there's a *.ipa file. The export procedure to create an ePub is supposed to be: Share&gt;Export&gt;ePub. /code/pre  But ePub is not one of the options. The options under ShareExport are: iBooks, PDF, Text. How can I create an ePub file??  <answer284343> I don't know if this will do what you want but have you tried using the app Calibre?  This is a free app for managing e-books. I use it at times to create PDF's from different formats. It manages many different formats. I'd suggest trying it and see if it will do what you want.  <comment358539> Apple states your template has to support epub in order to have the option to export it as epub: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2809?locale=en_US. Plus, isn't "iBooks" format just epub? <comment358545> I used *their* blank ePub template. iBooks have an .iBook extension. If you're suggesting that simply changing the extension from that to .epub is all that's necessary, that would be news indeed. <comment358581> Calibre won't read .ipa files. I tried using Calibre on an ePub and the ToC was useless, e.g., a single footnote was treated as a chapter.
