macOS Sierra search domain priority <body> It appears macOS Sierra only uses search domains for fallback only.  Example: A Mac has the search domain codesfo.example.org/code and the host codehost1.com.sfo.example.org/code exists.  Terminal commands (ping, host) will use codehost1.com./code instead of codehost1.com.sfo.example.org/codewhen I use code&lt;command&gt; host1.com/code.  The ssh command is an exception which prefers a search domain entry.  Not sure if this is relevent  precode$ more /etc/resolv.conf  # # Mac OS X Notice # # This file is not used by the host name and address resolution # or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on # this Mac OS X system. /code/pre  On a Linux box search domain is always preferred
