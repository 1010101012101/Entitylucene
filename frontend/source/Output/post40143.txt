Disabling Mission Control (OR making plist changes take effect immediately) <body> EDIT: I have just realized that what I'm talking about isn't a default feature in Lion. I probably added the commands via an article like this (scroll down to "Gestures and keyboard shortcuts"). So this question is more about how to make plist changes take effect immediately from Terminal.  I have spent about 4 hours looking for and developing a solution for a quick way to disable / enable Mission Control. My present line of thinking is:  I can disable the shortcuts to Mission Control, which would give me the same effect.  Oh look, I can disable the shortcuts via code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code! Let's see how I can modify that...  Darn it, the codedefaults/code command doesn't let me go deep enough into the sub-dictionaries to do what I want. But wait, I found code/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy/code! Now to write a script...  The script works (it changes the settings in the .plist file), but the changes aren't taking effect.  My questions:  ol liIs there a better way to do this?/li liWhat command can I add to my script to make my changes take effect immediately? You can see I have codekillall Dock/code in the script, and I've tried codekillall Finder/code and codekillall SystemUIServer/code, but none of those seem to work./li /ol  Hopefully this is the best place to ask this... I know this is OS-X-specific, but it's also highly technical.  <answer40177> No, there isn't really a better way to force a process to reload its preferences other than killing it.  Be careful: a process may flush its preferences when it is killed, so your change may get overwritten.
