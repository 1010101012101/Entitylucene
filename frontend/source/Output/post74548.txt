How can I type a backtick on an Estonian keyboard? <body> I am actually using the sweidsh keyboard with an estonian layout, so the backtick key itself produces kbd'/kbd and while holding kbdShift/kbd, it produces kbdâ€“/kbd.  Is there maybe a way to create a global keyboard shortcut?  <answer74553> Looking through the keybindings in the Estonian keyboard layout that ships with Mac OS X, it appears (amazingly) that the backtick character (code`/code) cannot be produced with any of the unmodified keys, nor with any combination of option, shift, or control, despite the fact that most of the option-character key combinations are left unmapped on this layout. There are many ways to modify it to produce this key combination.  You could create a modified Estonian layout using Ukelele, you could use a program like Keyboard Remap for Macbook, or even TextExpander.  <comment99598> Thanks! I finally managed to change my keyboard layout with Ukelele. Now I can type ` with just a small keybaord shortcut! <comment337921> I added my modified keyboard here: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3573333/est%20keyb%20modified.bundle.zip . Unzip it to your home folder Library/Keyboard Layouts folder and activate/select another "Estonian" keyboard in mac preferences. You can find where the key is with the _Keyboard Viewer_.
