Is disk version of iWork 08 compatible with El Capitan <body> Opened a iWork 08 Pages file created in 2015 and very little appears.  All text is white and canâ€™t be changed to black. This was not a problem on my previous OS.  IS this a El Capitan issue?  <answer232350> If you have installed iWork from disc you strongmay/strong be able to then upgrade to the latest version via the App Store. It's been a while since I tried it but it worked a few years ago.  That would then give you a compatible version that can open the older files.  <comment283690> Read the disk box for the application, and see if it has a Mac version of OS X that it is compatible with <comment283693> Did you try changing the typeface in addition to the color of the type? Can you save the file in RTF format and open it in TextEdi?
