Keyboard adjustment keys have black box around them <body> I recently did a fresh reformat and install of Yosemite on my macbook pro, it was working as expected until today when i noticed that whenever i use the top keyboard row keys to change something like screen brightness, volume, backlight level, there is a black box around the rounded box that normally pops up. Is this a common problem with yosemite and is there a fix?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYE7v.png" alt="Here is a screen shot of it"  <answer156142> This effect occurs when "Reduce Transparency" is enabled (System Preferences  Accessibility).  (Very odd that this is how the effect would degrade, instead of just make it a solid colored square.)  <answer189735> I solved it accidentally on my 2009 macbook pro running 10.10.3 by removing the battery, unplugging the charge cable, and holding the power button down for 15 seconds. I was trying to reset the SMC/PRAM for unrelated reasons and noticed the black boarders are gone.   <comment183633> The alpha channel (transparency) was apparently not taken into account when displaying the image on-screen. Were you doing anything particularly taxing on the system at the time? <comment183642> I found the problem because you mentioned transparency. I had accidentally turned on "Reduce Transparency" in the Accessibility Pane. If you would like to post a real reply i will gladly mark it as solved answer.
