What does (10 hours)² mean? (specifications) <body> I was looking at the specifications of the MacBooks (pro) on Apples website and I saw this. iBuilt-in battery (10 hours)²/i.  What does the '²' mean? Why (10 hours)² and not 10 hours?  <answer179685> There is an explanation in the footnotes:     2 Testing conducted by Apple in February 2015 using pre-production 2.9GHz dual-      core Intel Core i5–based 13-inch MacBook Pro units. The wireless web test measures battery life by wirelessly browsing 25 popular websites with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. The HD film playback test measures battery life by playing back HD 1080p content with display brightness set to 12 clicks from bottom or 75%. Battery life varies by use and configuration. See www.apple.com/uk/batteries for more information.   <answer179706> ‘²’ indicates there’s a footnote. It means, see the second footnote. It doesn’t mean the battery life is 10² hours, though that would be awesome.  <comment213161> Thanks. So the ² is like a *? <comment213162> Exactly. It is referring to the footnote. <comment213218> I knew it didn't mean 10² hours. :)
