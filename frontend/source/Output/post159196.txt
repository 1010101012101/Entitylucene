Enable "Developer" inside the "Settings" app on iOS <body> Before Xcode 6 one could go to the Xcode Organizer window. Tap on the Devices tab. Select the connected device and click the "Use for Development" button. See here.  However with Xcode 6 there are no longer a code"Use for Development"/code button. So how does one enable it?  h1Update/h1  My Devices window looks like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rRbMT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer159197> The devices tab is now a new screen. codeUse for Development/code no longer exists.  The option in Window → Devices or kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd2/kbd.   From that window you could enable devices for development by adding your provisioning profiles. Right click on device and select strongShow Provisioning Profiles.../strong. It will appear a window where you can add your profiles.  After that you will be able to install your apps in that device.  <answer219521> We just need to run our application on the connected device using xcode.  I got it on on my iPhone 6 with iOS 9.2 version by running a demo application from Xcode 7.2.  <answer249513> Thanks works with iOS 9.3.2 using Xcode 7.3.1. Just install a demo app using Xcode and the developer menu in the settings app will appear. Then you can just delete the demo app.  <comment187126> Aha. Thats it.
