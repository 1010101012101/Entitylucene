iPhone 7: Why is the viewable area different for 4K and SLO MO? <body> 4K shows more to left and right and above and below than 1080 and 720(not shown) in regular Video, but in SLO MO, the viewable area is the same as 4K  I've been comparing the corner of the wall and ceiling at the top left, and the butterfly painting at the right. It's almost as if the lens is wider.  Here are some images that show what I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C6XCM.jpg" alt="Comparison"
