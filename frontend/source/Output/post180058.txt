Shadows left in text <body> This is an odd issue. See this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UdCc.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is file manager edit on cPanel using OSX 10.2 and latest Firefox.  Occasionally, a shadow (grey text) as seen above is left above the text. The only way to make it disappear is via zoom in/out.   Why does this happen? And is there a proper solution to fixing/avoiding it?  I am guessing it has to do with some type of browser/osx caching...?
