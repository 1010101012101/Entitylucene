Applescript, OS X : How to Get a list of phone numbers from Contacts, and send an iMessage with Messages App? Halfway there I think..? <body> I am trying to create an applescript that will grab all of the stronglabeled/strong phone numbers of 'mobile' and 'iPhone' from the strongevery/strong contact in Contacts App (specifically the phone numbers from the iCloud account), and then send an iMessage or SMS to them using Messages App.   I think I have a good part of it, but I get 2 errors that I can't seem to understand.   precodetell application "Contacts"     repeat with eachContact in (get every person)         repeat with eachPhoneNum in (get phones of eachContact) if label of eachPhoneNum is "mobile" or "iPhone" then             delay 2              tell application "Messages"                 set myid to get id of first service                 set theBuddy to buddy eachPhoneNum of service id myid                 send theMessage to theBuddy             end tell end if         end repeat     end repeat end tell /code/pre  strongCorrected Error 1/strong: codeContacts got an error: Can’t get label./code As script is above.   Still experiencing Error 2: codeCan’t make «class az20» 1 of «class azf4» id "89E7AF18-A017-4119-B788-CBB96571FAAE:ABPerson" of application "Contacts" into the expected type./code   <comment186250> Could you try to make a [Minimal, Complete and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) that focuses on the problem that you are facing with the smallest amount of code possible? <comment186255> @grgarside - Updated. The previous code was a verifiable, complete, working example, but I am more than happy to clean it up to make it 'minimal'. Thanks :) <comment186260> As of error 1, you're getting phone label 'mobile' and label 'iPhone '. Can't try it out right now as I'm on iOS... <comment186262> @NikoNyman Yes, when I strip out the label criteria, I get a `class error` that it `can't convert the type`. I am assuming this means that it can't convert the result of `phone` into the variable `eachPhoneNum`and needs some kind of conversion.. But I even tried adding `as text` to convert it, and I still get the error. <comment186282> I was a bit unclear previously: have you tried `...whose phone label is "mobile" or phone label is "iPhone"`? To me it looks like you're getting the first error from trying to access `label "iPhone"` and (I assume) the property is called `phone label`. <comment186286> I've corrected the label area after 3 more hours of googling. It appears you can't pull LABEL inline, you have to parse it out afterward. But I'm still not able to get the phone number from each contact.
