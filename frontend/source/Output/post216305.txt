Is there any way to have disk images open in a normal finder window? <body> Why do disk images open in a finder window without the sidebar?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xj6cP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way to have disk images open in a normal finder window?  I find this really inconvenient when I just want to drag something to / from the disk image to something in the sidebar.  <comment261350> I'm not sure if this will work but its easy enough to try... Open a .dmg then use the View: Show Sidebar menu item (⌥⌘S) to make the sidebar visible then eject the dmg, reopen it and see if the window setting sticks. Then try with a different .dmg file... Let us know what happens.
