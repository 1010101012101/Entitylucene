TextEdit plain text tab distance <body> I just updated to El Capitan (from Yosemite) and I noticed a problem in TextEdit, plain text mode. My tab distance is set to 8 characters, and I think it's the default.  Every time there's a tab character at position 8 (or 16, or 24...) from the left side, the tab is now 0 width. If I try to delete the tab, nothing moves, as if there were two tabs at exactly the same X position. If I try to add a tab when in position 8, nothing happens either, because the tab has no width. Only if I do another tab, then it goes 8 characters further.  I have LOTS of documents that are plain text. I'm sure I'm not the only human being on Earth who uses tabs in plain text TextEdit regularly. If you have plain text documents with tabs in them, and you are using El Capitan (10.11.4), then you will see that your indentation is all messed up, in ALL your plain text documents.  There is a setting in com.Apple.TextEdit, called "TabWidth", and it is set to 8. I tried other distances, but each time the tabs are messed up in different ways. I tried to set it to 8.1, or 8.01, but to no avail. Either the tab behavior becomes glitchy, or the number is simply rounded off.  You can try it with a new document:  1) Open TextEdit 2) Make sure you are in plain text mode 3) Type any 8 characters (or the number of characters for your TabWidth setting) 4) Hit tab  Did the cursor move?  Should I consider this a bug? Anyone else has this problem? Hitting the tab key should always make the cursor move.  Any help or hint is appreciated.  <comment347969> Is this problem still there?
