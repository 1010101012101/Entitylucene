Safari Browser Bar - no longer functioning as expected <body> Please help!  The search / address bar in Safari normally autocompletes my typing. So for example, I can type em and it will autocomplete for me. It has randomly stopped functioning and is now forcing me to type a complete web address before it will take me to a site.  Secondly, I can normally type a word and press return and it will fire up google (my preferred search engine) with a list of suggestions but it has just stopped.  I don't remember changing anything - any suggestions its incredibly frustrating!  thanks in advance   <answer225189> This is a bug in safari.  Currently the workaround is to open Safari  Preferences  Search and disable "Include Safari Suggestions".  http://www.engadget.com/2016/01/27/apple-safari-suggestions-bug/
