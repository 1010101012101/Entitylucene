Trying to set an external Bootcamp drive as the Startup Disk <body> Is there a way to setup an external Bootcamp drive as the default startup disk? I want to do this in order to enable hyper-v virtualization on Windows on a MacBook Air (Early 2015 running 10.12.3 Sierra).  This is the error that I'm getting:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/vieXUw9.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/vieXUw9.png"  Windows 10 is installed on an external SSD in a 2.5" enclosure that uses USB 3.0. I already installed the Windows Support Software from Bootcamp onto it.  I can boot up from the external SSD by holding the kbdOption/kbd key during boot, but virtualization is disabled.  Unfortunately Apple Care reps also couldn't find a solution.  ul liWe made sure that the drive was functional by running First Aid/li liThe external drive uses a GUID Partition Map/li /ul  <answer276842> There are a few things you can try to resolve the exact issue in your question.  strongReset NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).

In other words, I guess what I'm wondering is if you're asking the right question? Have you read _all_ the answers and comments [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120361/how-to-turn-on-hardware-virtualization-on-late-2013-macbook-pro-for-windows-8-1?noredirect=1&lq=1) to see if there's anything useful to you? For example, there's a comment by Chui Tey on 23 Dec 2016 that I found interesting. Either way, maybe something there will solve your main issue. <comment348666> How did you managed to install Windows in an external drive? right now Im trying different approaches and I can't get it to boot <comment349148> Do you have any helpful links or references on using Terminal to set the Startup disk?
