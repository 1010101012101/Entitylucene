Will 'Internet Recovery' necessarily erase my hard drive? <body> My Mac is booting to the 'question mark' folder. I option-booted to 'Internet Recovery'. Before I proceed, I would like to know: Will 'Internet Recovery' necessarily erase my hard drive? Can anyone confirm this (maybe even provide a source link)?  <answer123161> No, doing an Internet Recovery emwill not/em erase your hard drive (unless you explicitly choose do to that using codeDisk Utility/code). It will only reinstall the OS for you. You should get your drive checked to see if it's just data corruption or a deeper hardware issue that has resulted in the question mark folder icon being shown.  Also, this question has been answered on superuser - see "Does Internet Recovery erase everything on my Mac?"
