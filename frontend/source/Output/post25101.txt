Difference between Phillips 00 and 000 <body> I'm not really at home in the screwdriver world, and since this question relates to my purchase of a MBP I figured I could ask the question here. Whats the difference between a Phillips 00 and a 000 screwdriver?  <answer25103> A difference in sizing, I don't think it's particularly a large difference.   There is a difference though, if you're looking after your screws then the correct driver is always best.  <answer25108> 000 is smaller and has thinner blades.  00 is larger and has thicker blades.   Using a tool that doesn't exactly match the screw means you can't get proper surface contact. This increases the chance of stripping the head of the screw on removal - especially if the screw threads have locking adhesive.  For assembly, the wrong tool makes it harder to torque the screw properly.  With a high quality tool and a screw that isn't too tight, you can sometimes mix 000/00 for screw and tool, but it's not ideal as the difference is significant for the tolerances in a MacBook Pro. If you're looking for an entire kit, this driver set is quite nice as well. You do get "a little play" any time there is a socket/bit connection; but for home use, iFixit sells great value and good quality tools.  <comment28294> And is there a difference between 00 and #00? <comment28295> One's got a hash and the other doesn't. Nah, there's no difference, just a difference in how they get listed, the 00 is a standard reference code.
