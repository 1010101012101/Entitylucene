Spotlight does not find html files <body> We have noticed that with recent versions of OS X that Spotlight does not find html files.  As web developers it came as quite a shock to us and we thought we had Spotlight settings incorrect. It was only until I checked “Developer” in Spotlight preferences did html files show in results but when used “show all in Finder” there was nothing there.  If you don’t have Xcode installed you’ll never find html files with Spotlight and even with Xcode/Developer you can’t locate the html files because they don’t show in Finder after a search.  Spotlight will find txt files and just about every other type of files but not html....  Anyone else find this same issue or have a fix?  <comment326727> Spotlight work well with my html files.My file is example.html,and when i search the name example.html,it shows both in results and finder <comment326735> Can you define recent versions? Post the OS version (found under Apple Menu - About This Mac). <comment326743> El Capitan 10.11.6 Weird because if I search index.html what shows are a few files called "index.html copy" which are copies I made when editing. I'll be getting an upgrade to Sierra and will see if the problem is with my El Capitan.
