Free space on volume rapidly disappearing! <body> I have a Samsung SSD 850 EVO installed in February I believe. No problems thus far.   Recently (I'd' say past few days) I noticed my free space going down more than expected. I was at 293 GB free (out of 500 GB total) a few weeks back. Somehow yesterday I was in the mid 100s (around 150, say) remaining. Several hours ago I was at 95.63 GB remaining. Right now, I am at 65.93 GB remaining! Worried I would be able to operate soon.   Does anyone know anything about why or how this is happening and/or how I can stop and subsequently reverse the trend?  <comment364416> In case I should make clear, no I don't do heavy video-watching or editing (I downloaded a few hundred megabytes worth for some instruction purposes earlier this week). <comment364418> Probably related: 1.

Thoughts on this? <comment364420> You have to run the tool with admin privileges - if possible. Else: install [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) (iirc 7-day full functional trial) and run it as admin. Then make a screenshot of the result (shift-cmd-4, then space bar: choose DisyDisk window) and add it to your question. <comment364446> So the jist of the solution turned out to be: restart computer. Back up to 240-some GB free. Much better. I guess, if anyone can tell me, I'd like to know wjhy I've had this computer for several years and nothing like this has happened before. Is this specifically a symptom of having an SSD or does it happen to HDD users as well? If the latter is true, what is it that simply grown to a size unable to withstand being powered on and required professional service (or at least required something more in-depth for me than a simple restart?)? <comment364447> Please add a second question with some details (i.e. which folders/files are growing and shrinking like mad). The culprits in the first link provided in my first comment were gradle, IDEA and iTerm2 caches.
