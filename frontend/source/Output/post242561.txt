Which iPad Mini is model FD528LL/A? <body> I'm trying to identify a friend's iPad Mini.  I know the model number from the "About" screen is FD528LL/A.  Unfortunately, I don't have the model number from the back of the iPad.  Is this an iPad Mini 1, 2, 3, or 4?  <answer242564> Your friend has a Refurbished iPad Mini (1st Generation, 16GB, Wi-Fi Only, Black).   The number on the back should say A1432.   The F generally indicates a refurbished product (not always).
