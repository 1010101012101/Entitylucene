Can I stop 'instruments' from asking me to authenticate? <body> Is there any way to stop instruments.app from asking me for a name/password pair every time I run it?   <comment109342> If you are referring to Instruments.app that is embedded within Xcode.app bundle, are both Xcode.app and applications inside it set to user root and group wheel? <comment109350> Yes I am, and of course no they aren't. Is that recommended? It seems terribly unsafe to me.
