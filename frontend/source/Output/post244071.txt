Minimize all but the active of the current application's windows <body> I switch to, for example, Safari and find the window I want. I can codeCommand-Option-H/code to hide all the other applications, but I emalso/em want to minimize all the Safari windows except the one I'm using (the front-most one).  Is there a way to do this? Would settle for an AppleScript I can trigger with Keyboard Maestro.  <answer244275> Here is an AppleScript that emachieves the results/em of what you originally explicitly and specifically asked for, before editing the question after it was answered.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "Safari"     activate     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "h" using {command down, option down}     end tell     set miniaturized of (windows whose index is not 1) to true end tell /code/pre  hr  Note: The above AppleScript works for me under OS X 10.8.5 and Safari 6.2.8 however I have not tested it on any other version of OS X. That said, I believe it will work fine on other versions of OS X.  hr  Update to address the edit of the original question:  I played around a bit with different methods and what I found was, within the ways I tried, most apps worked while some would not. In other words, I didn't find a universal method that worked with all the apps I normally run. So, I'm adding a block of emcode/em that you can try and see if it can work for you.  Ideally simply hiding all other apps and minimizing the non-active windows of the current app so as to have a smooth appearance in action it what's desired however Finder presented a challenge.  So in this example emcode/em Finder must minimize all it windows first and bring back what was the frontmost while other apps have a nice cascading effect to minimized non-active windows while leaving the frontmost windows as is.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events"     set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true     set windowName to name of first window of application process frontApp end tell  if not frontApp is "Finder" then     tell application frontApp         activate         tell application "System Events"             keystroke "h" using {command down, option down}         end tell         set miniaturized of (windows whose name is not windowName) to true     end tell else     tell application frontApp         activate         tell application "System Events"             keystroke "h" using {command down, option down}             keystroke "m" using {command down, option down}             tell process frontApp to click menu item windowName of menu 1 of menu bar item "Window" of menu bar 1         end tell     end tell end if /code/pre  <comment301021> Works! However, I was looking for something that'd work for whatever application is front. Adding `set frontApp to name of first application process whose frontmost is true` and then changing "Safari" to frontApp in the first line doesn't seem to work!? <comment301022> @Alesh Houdek, In your comment you said, "_I was looking for something that'd work for whatever application is front_" and **that is not at all what you said in your question** as you explicitly and specifically said "_I switch to Safari and find the window I want. I can Command-Option-H to hide all the other applications, but I also want to minimize all the Safari windows except the one I'm using (the front-most one)._" which is exactly what the AppleScript I provided does! <comment301023> That is true!!! I guess I was thinking "for example." Very poor question. Still, it's odd that it doesn't work with my slight modification. <comment301142> I've updated my answer with an additional block of _code_ you can try.
