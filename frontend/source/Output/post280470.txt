How to disable scrolling while clicking with the Magic Mouse? <body> I want to disable one finger scrolling with my Magic Mouse while I click with it, because I don't like that it scrolls the content in apps if I click something. I also don't see any practical use of letting this thing enabled.  Video about my problem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqCo3mEH51A  Very important, that I want to keep the scrolling on, which I generally love, so shrinking the scroll area with MagicPrefs or disabling scrolling fully is not a good workaround for me.  Are there any tools which let me disable any scroll events during the mouse button is down?  <answer281940> Since we've established that your Magic Mouse doesn't have this behaviour with another computer, I'd reset your NVRAM and also do a boot into Safe Mode.  strongResetting the NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).   Since you haven't specified what model of Mac you're using, below are some generic steps that will work with all models (including all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models):  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR/kbd keys. /li liKeep these keys pressed down for strongat least 20 seconds!/strong/li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  Now test your Magic Mouse to determine if the issue is still present. If this doesn't resolve it for you, proceed to booting into Safe Mode.  strongNote 1:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps to boot your Mac into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice)./li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. test your Magic Mouse)/li liNow exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li liAgain, take a note of what happens (i.e. test your Magic Mouse)/li /ol  Once you've booted into Safe Mode, let me know how you went and we'll go from there.  strongTrash Magic Mouse .plist files/strong  Since your issue persists both in and out of Safe Mode, I would trash the relevant Magic Mouse preference files.  As you don't specify what version of macOS you're using, I'll assume you're running a version from Mountain Lion and above. Follow these steps:  ol liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key/li liWhile keeping the kbdoption/kbd key down, click on the Go menu and select emLibrary/em from the list/li liThis should open up your user's Library folder in a new Finder window/li liLocate and open the Preferences folder (it's within the Library folder)/li liWithin this folder find the following two .plist files:  ul licom.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist/li licom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist/li /ul/li liNow Trash these files/li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  Your Mac will now create a new set of default preference files for your Magic Mouse.   strongNote:/strong You will need to go back to System Preferences and reconfigure your Magic Mouse settings. However, strongbefore/strong doing that I would test the Magic Mouse first to see if the problem behaviour still persists.  strongReset Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller/strong  This is something I've had a number of users do to resolve issues with 3rd party Bluetooth devices (usually a keyboard and/or mouse, but also headphones etc).  Since you're using a genuine Apple Magic Mouse you my decide not to bother, but I think it's worth trying.  In a nutshell you need to reset both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset strongall/strong connected Bluetooth devices, including your keyboard and mouse, so strongeach Bluetooth device will need to be paired again/strong.  I have some steps you can follow, but I strongly suggest you read all of the steps first before commencing (or perhaps print out the instructions / view them on another device).  Before starting, ensure you have the Bluetooth icon showing in the menu bar. If it is not there, open System Preferences  Bluetooth and enable the option emShow Bluetooth in Menu Bar/em.  Also, since you're trying to resolve an issue with your Magic Mouse,  strongyou will need to use another mouse to follow these steps/strong:  ol liHold down both the kbdShift/kbd and kbdOption/kbd keys and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. Once the menu is showing, release the keys.    /li liFrom the Bluetooth menu, choose Debug  Remove All Devices/li liHold down both the kbdShift/kbd and kbdOption/kbd keys again and at the same time click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar. /li liFrom the Bluetooth menu,  choose Debug  Reset the Bluetooth Module/li liShutdown your Mac/li liEnsure your Magic Mouse is fully powered off/li liRestart your Mac/li liOn your Mac, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar /li liSelect the emSet Up Bluetooth Device/em option/li liOn the mouse, turn the power on/li liOnce the Setup Assistant finds the mouse, select it from the list and click on “Continue”. /li liNow pair your mouse/li liIf you have any other Bluetooth devices, you can go ahead and pair them now (or you can do it later). /li /ol  Let me know how you go.  <comment354895> I watched your video and tried replicating your issue on a number of computers, but the Magic Mouse never scrolled content while I clicked on something, so I'm not sure what's happening at your end. Have you tried using your Magic Mouse with another Mac, or testing another Magic Mouse at a retail store? Obviously you've had good play with MagicPrefs, but what else have you tried? Does the issue occur in Safe Mode? Have you tried resetting the NVRAM? <comment354897> Hm, haven't thought about this before: I've tried my mouse now with a new computer, and it does not do the issue there. Very strange, so it will be something software related issue... <comment354899> I've just posted an answer for some steps you can try. If you have a problem performing either, let me know. <comment354908> Neither of this helped. The problem also exists with safe boot after a PRAM reset. <comment354911> On the other way: I still can scroll when I move my finger while clicking on a new computer too. Only the threshold seems to be different. I am looking for a way to totally disable the scrolling while I click. <comment355062> Okay, so this issue exists while booted into Safe Mode and also afterwards when rebooted normally. I would suggest trashing the relevant .plist files as your next step. I'll update my answer to include instructions. <comment355074> Thank you again for your efforts. Trashing the config files didn't help either. They seemed harmless anyway: https://gist.github.com/gklka/df7205b9268c75dce4486a466982f738 and https://gist.github.com/gklka/0432f5894431a3eb2f2b43416d03f503 <comment355211> I actually prefer the Windows mouses(not trackpads) most of the time.  Just my 2 cents. <comment355672> I've been thinking about this issue and the fact it still happens in Safe Mode on your Mac, but doesn't happen on the other computer. You could try resetting both the macOS Bluetooth Device List and Bluetooth Controller. However, this will reset __all__ connected Bluetooth devices, including a keyboard, so you'd have to add them back as you use them. I will update my answer to include the steps if you decide to go ahead (it's harmless - it just means if you have heaps of Bluetooth devices you'll need to pair them again). Can't guarantee this will solve your problem, but it may do. <comment355696> I watched the video several times and one thing I noticed is how you're holding the mouse and clicking it, and sincerely with no offense intended, you frankly just need to click with a lighter smoother action and stop moving your finger while you're clicking the mouse. The magic mouse wasn't designed and meant to be use as if it was a telegraph sending morse code. Lay your hand and fingers flatter on the mouse and click with the flat of the distal phalanges more so then the tip of it. This should stop the finger from sliding and causing the scroll like presently the way you're using the mouse. <comment355697> That said, I think the only other way the scroll capabilities of the mouse can be stopped while clicking would be to run a program that's designed specifically to trap the _mouse down event_ at which point the scroll capability would be programmatically disabled or any _scroll event_ dropped until the _mouse up event_ occurs. I've done this type of programming before under Windows, so I'd imagine it's possible under macOS as well. <comment355881> Did not help :( Maybe my test with an another mac was too quick, so the issue exists there too, it was just too quick to judge it's not happening based on a few clicks. :( <comment355882> Sorry to hear that. :( If I think of anything else to try I'll let you know.
