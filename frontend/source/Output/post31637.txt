How do i stop Quicktime from opening previous videos? <body> I'm on OSX Lion and this is driving me crazy. Whenever i watch a video in quicktime and close it, then open another video, the previous video that i played also comes up.  Is there a way to not have the previous video(s) come up when opening quicktime besides closing out the windows, then quitting, everytime?  <answer31638> That feature is part of Lion and QuickTimeX, but you can disable it.  Open your terminal (/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app) or use Spotlight to find the Terminal and type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows -bool false /code/pre  That should stop QuickTime from saving the opened windows when you quit it.  If you want to revert the behavior, change the "false" to "true".
