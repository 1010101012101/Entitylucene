Is it possible to run Android on iOS? <body> Ok so I was thinking, Can you run Android on a iOS device? I did some research and Android could run on ARM (Most apps would not work) but how come no one has tried to run it. Whats holding them back?    <answer213266> Many reasons  ol liYou cannot create another file system/li liNo firmware exists for this/li liIt would void your warranty/li liAndroid device developers spend a lot of time developing their hardware and software to work together, just like iOS./li liThe amount of effort required (boot ROM firmware  modifications, bricked devices, etc) makes it much easier just to buy an Android if you emreally/em want one./li /ol  <answer224655> There is no tool or way to do this by yourself. Theoretically, you could run Android on iOS but it would be near impossible. To do this, someone would have to reverse engineer Android and figure out how to dual boot an iOS device. It has been done in the past with the iPhone 2g and the iDroid project so it is possible but it has not been continued. If you have a computer, you can run Android on your computer using Bluestacks. However, at the moment, there is no way to run Android on your iOS devices.  <comment261173> Wrong! iDroid Project they have successfully ran Android and Linux via a bootrom exploit! <comment261210> @Andrew A Google search tells me this is from 2010. My reasons stand with current hardware. <comment261415> Yes this would not work on modern iOS devices but might be possible. <comment273913> Thanks, this is very helpful information! :D
