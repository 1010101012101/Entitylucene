how can i get iPhoto pictures back after factory reset on MacBook Pro <body> I have done a factory reset on my MacBook Pro because it was slow. Now i have lost my pictures on iPhoto. The pictures were not backed up on iCloud.  How can i get iPhoto pictures back?   <answer146949> If we assume that you do not have a Time Machine backup, you cannot. If you can enter Time Machine, you may be able to restore your iPhoto library in code~/Pictures/iPhoto Library/code.  <answer146952> This might be a bit too obvious, but if you have them on another device (such as an iPhone) you can import them again.  <comment173195> How did you do a factory reset?
