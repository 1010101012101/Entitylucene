Where do I learn to manage a Mac OS Server network? <body> I inherited a network with 2 Mac OS Servers and 20+ Macbook Pros. My background is all Windows server so I get the concept of Open Directory, Server Admin, and Workgroup Manager, but the nuts and bolts are more difficult to pick up.  Can someone recommend a starting point to learn all of this? So much of the resources I found out there are for home users and not necessarily for a work environment.  <answer41399> strongIfskills/strong has a great tutorial of Mac OS X Server. I'm still going through it myself. It is massively helpful.  <answer41411> Apple has a certification program analogous to Microsoft's MCSE (Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer) certification. They have classroom training at authorized training centers, but they are offered in far fewer cities and less often than those for Microsoft or Cisco. If your employer is willing to pay for it, it would be a good idea to pursue this.  I hold three Apple certifications (see my Ask Different profile here on this site) although none of mine are in network administration.  You might want to pursue the Apple Certified Technical Coordinater certification. If not, at least look at the training materials and third-party books that cover preparation for the Apple OS X Server Essentials 10.7 Exam (9L0-515), or the previous exam for 10.6, which is still available.  Look at Apple's Training and Certification web site to learn about their program.  In the meantime, I would steer you to the Apple-authorized training books from Peachpit Press.  <answer41418> If you are looking for a learning place you can check:   http://www.certifiedtraining.com/coursedesc.php?id=101 http://www.learningtree.com/search/search.aspx?Submit.x=0&amp;Submit.y=0&amp;Submit=Submit&amp;q=Mac http://training.apple.com/classes http://www.lynda.com/Mac-OS-X-10-7-tutorials/Mac-OS-X-Lion-Essential-Training/85081-2.html  If looking to learn on your own at your own pace... there are great resources/books out there.

Those of us that know would be happy to answer as best we can. <comment47074> Thanks. This is what I was looking for...sorry if my question wasn't clear enough for everyone else's answer.
