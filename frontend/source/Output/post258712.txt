Map left mouse button in Karabiner Elements <body> I want to map CapsLock to Left Mouse Button using Karabiner Elements in macOS Sierra.   I used to have such mapping in previous OS X versions using Seil and Karabiner but those no longer work in Sierra.  I tried to guess what should I put in the configuration JSON but failed.   precode"simple_modifications" : {     "caps_lock" : WHAT_SHOULD_I_PUT_HERE? }, /code/pre  Is it even possible to map Caps Lock to Left Mouse button in Karabiner Elements?  <comment373754> From looking at the examples, it doesnâ€™t appear to be possible yet. If it does I think it might be a Complex Modification.
