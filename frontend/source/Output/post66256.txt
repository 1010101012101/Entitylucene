How to download command line tools in xcode 4.5 <body> I just installed xcode 4.5 and need to install the command line tools.  The apple documentations says (with very little detail) that there is a download section in the preferences pane.  I have yet to see anywhere that allows you to download anything, specifically the command line tools.  Did Apple change xcode drastically, I do not have a downloads section.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W7N30.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66258> On Xcode:  Preferences  Downloads  Components  DMG's directly from:  https://developer.apple.com/downloads  <answer122378> The downloads tab is not available when you open xcode-developer. I found his out by searching in spotlight and noticing two versions could be opened. Open the xcode-main one instead and follow the instructions as above.  <answer126601> Xcode 5.1.1 has a new argument:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/xcode -installComponents /code/pre  <answer130566> For xCode version 5.1.1  Start the strongXcode/strong program  Select strongXcode/strong from the top left of the toolbar.  Select strongOpen Developer Tools/strong instead of Preferences.    Select strongMore Developer Tools/strong at the bottom of the list and it will take you to the Apple Developer Page where you can download the strongCommand Line Tools/strong.  hr  EDIT: Added a another step to the instructions after reading the post from Garman  <comment77929> I just uploaded a screenshot.  I do not have a downloads tab.  Unless I am looking somewhere wrong.... <comment77931> @ngramsky I think you are. Click the Xcode menu, go preferences, then go downloads tab, then click the Components subtab. That's what I see here, using 4.5. <comment77933> @ngramsky ... your screen shot is weird. I don't know what's up. <comment77934> Thanks!  Unsure why the download tab is no longer present.  It seems like Apple is making A LOT of weird changes lately.... <comment77935> This is the 'new' xcode that was downloaded yesterday....  Version 4.5.1 <comment129984> That screenshot displays a very old version of XCode. Are you sure you are starting a current version of XCode? <comment142847> What is Xcode-developer and Xcode-main ? and Xcode is not on version 5
