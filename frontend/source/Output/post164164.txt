(ps: while i'm pretty familiar with UNIX like systems, i'm totally windows noob &amp; ignorant)  <answer164168> you can install Microsoft remote desktop for mac, this app can access the windows pc desktop remotely. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12  <answer164170> A couple of options come to mind. You can try both and see which works best for you.  1) you can install VNC for Windows (there are several versions) on her machine  Most are free and should work with the OSX vnc client application. I haven't use it so I can't say more. As long as they on the same network you should not have any problems. Over the internet, things get complicated...  2) install a free (for personal use) application like TeamViewer.  I prefer Teamviewer as it is simpler and it will work from anywhere in the world with a semi decent connection. There are several other applications like this out there but I've used it for years and I've come to trust it.  The other good thing about TeamViewer is that once her machine has it installed (and password protect it), it will get an numeric ID that should not change. Open an account with TeamViewer.com and save her ID there. Then anywhere in the world you can find her machine and share her screen. Neat no?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T1d5Y.jpg" alt="TeamViewer"  Hope that helped.  <comment192356> Hm, just tried it and it says: _Unable to connect to remote PC. Please verify Remote Desktop is enabled, the remote PC is turned on and available on the network, and then try again._ Probably need something setup/enable on the windows... could you please extend your answer with more details? <comment192357> You can't screen share with MRD - logging in with RD will log the existing user out. TeamViewer would be a better bet. <comment192358> @Tetsujin - TeamViewer is nice, but (as far as i know) need for each session is need to run teamviewer on the windows and this is "too much work" for my wife :) ;) <comment192359> As i said in another comment: TeamViewer is nice, but (as far as i know) for each session is needed to run teamviewer on the windows and this is "too much work" for my wife :) ;) - going to check some "VNC" for windows and will report back... <comment192360> TeamViewer can just be set to run at login, no user-action required once set up initially. For what you want I'm certain it's the best option. We use it at work to access things like interactive touch screens in colleges, where there *is* no real 'remote user'. Set & forget on-site once. <comment192361> For best security, yes but you can also install it as a service so that it is always waiting for connection, with or without approval. <comment192362> @Tetsujin - SURE? If yes (and going to check it immediately) - if is enough setup it once - it will be probably the best option. Thank for the help. <comment192363> Going to try it immediately - if will work, accepting this answer. ;) +1 for now :) thanks. <comment192364> yes, as Vic says, slightly less secure, but can be set as a service, always-on. <comment192368> Also has the advantage that it's easier to punch through a firewall, as both host & client are 'looking out' rather than something 'getting in'
