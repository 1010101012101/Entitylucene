Is there a way I can mount an FTP Server as a network drive in Finder, and make it writable? <body> I've tried Transmit, Forklift; they cost a lot, and I'm not that willing to spend money on this. OS X Fusion says it is installed, but the application seems to be installed nowhere. And obviously Finder is read-only. Ultimately, the goal is to be able to store Unity projects on a server and access the files and write to them within Unity because the projects take up a lot of space.
