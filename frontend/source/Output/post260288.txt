Is it possible to create an Apple Script to remove anchor on images in Word <body> So at work i made an Automator that pretty much opens the selected Word document that contains an image, the  it will extract and save the image in .png format in a folder that was crated named «Extracted images from word» and then close the document. It works fine but today something happened that I was not expecting. The automator did not work, so after multiples fix and attempt I noticed that the image within the Word file was anchored (I noticed it when I toggled the show hidden char and mouse-over the picture). So basically the automator do not treat the image as an image due to that. Is there a way to make either:  A) AppleScript to remove the Anchor and then let the automator pursue with his actions?  B) To make an entire script to do the whole thing (Open doc, extract image, save it to a specific created folder + remove the anchor if finds any)?  C) Or in the best scenario have the automator open the script (as part of the process )and then continue running what he is running?  And if yes what should it look like or be? I am new to script, Automator is not that bad since everything is written and detailed so!  Thanks in advance!
