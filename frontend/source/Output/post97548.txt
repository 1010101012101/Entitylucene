iPad ethernet connection? <body> I'm looking for a hardware solution for a work trip I'm taking soon. The options at the moment seem to be a new Chromebook, or an iPad (which I already have) with bluetooth keyboard. I need a full-sized keyboard (I'll be doing a lot of writing, and Google Drive is an acceptable editor), and a web browser. However, I am not confident that wireless internet in the venue will be as reliable as the wired (ethernet) connection. I would need a USB dongle for the Chromebook; is there a solution to provide a comparable ethernet connection to the iPad? (Comments on this answer suggest no, but I'm curious if anything has changed, or if there's a more general solution than that question asked for.)  <answer97551> You could always buy a small router. An Airport Express (or any other cheaper alternative) would do, if you have access to a power socket.   There might be devices that don't need to be plugged in, but I don't know any good ones to recommend.  <answer117334> Well iPad seems to support Ethernet with this following configuration as report 9to5Mac :  ul liLighting to USB adapter/li liPowered USB Hub/li liA USB to Ethernet Adapter/li liA Ethernet router. /li /ul  <comment114451> Interesting. I'll do some research and see if the venue will allow this. <comment117751> Just to follow up on this: in the end I decided a $10 Ethernet-to-USB adapter for the Chromebook was a simpler answer than my 1st-generation Airport Express which has been sketchy in the past, so I didn't get a chance to test this. WiFi in the venue was indeed exceedingly flaky and ethernet was the only way to go; what I don't know is if my own network would've been better. <comment181488> I'm surprised this has not received more attention. I too am looking for a way to connect an iPad to ethernet ... don't want to use wi-fi / wireless for health reasons.
