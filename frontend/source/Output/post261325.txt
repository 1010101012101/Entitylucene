Turning off the dialer and voicemail on the iPhone <body> I have an iPhone 5c and i want to turn off the dialer and voicemail on it and leave just favorites, contacts and recents. How do I do that?  <comment327278> I just want to clarify...you have an iPhone but you don't want the "phone" portion of it, correct?  If this is the case, Apple has an excellent solution, it's called  an [iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/). <comment327398> I was meaning keeping the phone portion but turning off the dialer and voicemail and keeping just contacts, favourites and recents <comment327563> You can't turn off or otherwise disable the dialer or any of the phone functions.  Apple doesn't allow you to do that.
