why does the which command output the same path twice? <body> Why does this command have this output?  precode$which -a python /usr/local/bin/python /usr/local/bin/python /usr/bin/python /code/pre  Specifically, why is "/usr/local/bin/python" listed twice?  The "/usr/local/bin" directory only occurs once in my PATH.  I've only noticed this happening for homebrew installed software thus far.  I'm not certain exactly which version of the which command I am using. But I think it comes from Apple.  precode$which -a which /usr/bin/which /code/pre  <answer251166> codewhich/code searches your PATH variable for instances of the program. With a code-a/code option it lists all instances of the program's path. Your PATH variable has two instances of code/usr/local/bin/code, that is why you see the program path listed twice.  <comment275095> Is Python linked from somewhere else in the search path?
