Safari 6 freezing <body> I've recently upgraded to Safari 6 in Lion and I'm seeing some pages freeze: I cannot scroll down and sometimes cannot click on anything. Safari is still alive and working but the freeze cannot be fixed by reloading the page.  A short Google session turned up a few comments about this being a problem with Javascript (apparently Safari is using a new engine). Sure enough, if I disable Javascript (using the Debug menu), then the freeze is gone after reloading the page. However, this is very inconvenient.  Does this happen to others? Does anyone have a better fix?  <answer118105> I’ve upgraded to Safari 6.1.1 and till now it’s behaving very well, no freezes.  <comment108437> I ended up getting feed up with safari, and moving to chrome. I've enjoy it much more. <comment108438> @demure, yeah... I like Safari 5 just fine and Safari 6 seemed just as fine, until it began acting up. <comment108439> Sorry, no solution, I ended up not using it till mom apple comes with a clean version. <comment109116> Here is a discussion at Apple forums, but with no solution: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4145775. <comment159895> The same freezes have started again, out of the blue, now with Safari 6.1.4...
