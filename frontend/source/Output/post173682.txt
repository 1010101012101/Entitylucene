Add a word count feature that determines pay (for freelancer paid per word) <body> I am a freelance writer and I frequently use Pages to draft my articles. I appreciate having the word count on the bottom of the document because I am often paid by the word. Periodically, I'll see how many words I've written, break out my calculator, and see how much money I've made for a bit of motivation.  However, I think it'd be really nice to have a little box next to word count that said how much money I've made so far. The function would get the current word count, I would pass it the constant of 'rate of pay per word,' and it would calculate how much I've made as I type.   I want to set the rate of pay per word in a drop-down or something and have the "money made" display next to the word count box.  I have some programming experience but I've never used Applescript or Automator. Can someone get me started with this? Thanks!  <answer173722> Update: I originally had this using a Table. But have now changed it to a Text Object.  hr  Here is you start then.  Save this Applescript as a strongStay Open/strong Application.  precodeon idle     tell application "Pages"         set ActualCount to count words of body text of document 1          set calculation to ActualCount * 0.02          set object text of text item 1 of document 1 to (ActualCount &amp; " words  = £" &amp; calculation as string)      end tell     return 5 -- runs every n# seconds  end idle /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CzRtc.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Now in your document add a Text Object.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xpBCw.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the Text Object Arrange tab in the Format inspector.  Set the emObject Placement to strongMove with text/strong./em  And *Text Wrap to strongAbove and Below/strong  This will save the need to manually move the Text Object down the document as you go.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MUU5i.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  Now run the App. Start typing.  The one thing you will notice is that the real word count sees the word in the table. strong329/strong That is why I have included the word count in the text objects results.  strong326 words  = £6.5/strong  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKMyz.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  <comment204404> Updated my answer so we can get the object to move down the page of it's own accord.
