DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter doesn't play audio on Samsung TV <body> I can't make my strongMacBook Pro mid 2009/strong play audio on my Samsung LCD TV. I am aware that only recents MacBook Pro have audio out through the Mini DisplayPort and mine doesn't have it. This is why I bought an adapter that includes digital audio.  I can see the video on the TV but can't hear anything, the sound is still going out of my laptop.  I tried to go in "strongSystem Preferences  Audio  Output/strong" but I can only see "Internal Speakers" from here.  Do you have any idea what did I miss here? Thanks.  <answer64263> Without resorting to AirPort or other networked setups, your only option is probably to just use a 3.5mm jack from your headphone port, which would unfortunately only give you stereo audio.  <comment75517> I finally managed to make it work... I had to reboot my computer, weird. Thanks anyway for trying to help me! <comment75518> See my comment above, thanks anyway. <comment75530> glad you got it to work :)
