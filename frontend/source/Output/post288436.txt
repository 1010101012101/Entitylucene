Building & Installing Darwin 16.6 from source at `opensource.apple.com`? <body> I was wondering if it is possible; if so how do I build a bootable installer image from the source code provided at Apple Source Code Repository? I have been building my own OS for quite a while now, and would like to get a proper installer image built, perhaps even release a public beta. However it requires a proper Unix base to function (none of this Linux monolithic kernel nonsense!).   While I theoretically could port it to run under a Linux environment instead, this would take a lot of work, requiring me to rewrite large swaths of the scripts used by the system. On top of that FreeBSD, the only other true Unix left as far as I can find, has vast differences from Darwin that would require an equally tedious and time consuming amount of porting as Linux.  For this reason it would be vastly preferable to simply package the system on top of a copy of vanilla open source Darwin, in a style similar to how systems like Ubuntu are shipped on top of Debian. However, while the source for Darwin (16.6) is readily available at the above link, pre-built ISOs end around version 8.0.1, and there is no available documentation from Apple as far as I can find on how to compile/build an installer from said source.  <comment364250> "and there is no available documentation from Apple as far as I can find on how to compile/build an installer from said source" are you saying that Apple should provide that documentation? If so, why? <comment364252> I don't believe that Darwin is an OSS project at Apple. <comment364256> @SolarMike I am not saying Apple has a responsibility to provide that documentation, I am merely saying it would be helpful if *someone*, be it Apple or a third party, provided this documentation. Aside from the fact that it is licensed as open source software, all of their closed source software has some form of documentation available. They used to provide pre-built Darwin images, and now the source, but no documentation, so there isn't much way to use it. It would be useful for Apple developers and programmers in general if the documentation existed. <comment364257> @Allan Darwin is the open source Unix base on top of which macOS is built. It was built and is maintained by Apple, and the entire source for each new version of Darwin can be downloaded from the Apple Open Source Repository (Darwin 14=macOS 10.10, Darwin 15=macOS 10.11, Darwin 16=macOS 10.12) See this link for proof: [macOS Sierra 10.12.4 Source Repository](https://opensource.apple.com/release/macos-10124.html)
