How to set a text as a footer with Pages? <body> I woudld like to set a footer on my page, in order to make some annotation, like this picture.  img src="https://support.content.office.net/fr-fr/media/ddc40c79-e7e7-46b2-bccf-6322c09a7323.gif" alt="example"  I would like to make something like the number strong3/strong.  I am using Pages from Mac OS X :)  <answer190564> The feature you are looking for are the footnotes/endnotes     A document can contain footnotes, which appear at the bottom of the   page, or endnotes, which appear at the end of the document or a   section. You can’t have both footnotes and endnotes in the same   document, but you can convert all notes in the document from one type   to another.      By default, footnotes and endnotes are numbered continuously   throughout the document with Arabic numerals, but you can change this   formatting.      You can also restyle the text used within the note. For example, you   can italicize or underline a book title within the note.      Use the Footnotes pane of the Format inspector to format footnotes and   endnotes.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fbRRm.png" alt="enter image description here"     strongInsert a footnote, endnote, or section endnote/strongbr /   The first time you   insert a note, it’s a footnote by default. If you want document or   section endnotes rather than footnotes, you must first add a footnote   and then convert it to an endnote.      ol   liClick in the text where you want to insert the symbol for a footnote   or endnote./li   liClick Insert in the toolbar, then choose Footnote./li   /ol      The symbol is inserted in the text and the insertion point moves to   the footnote text field at the bottom of the page.      ol start="3"   liEnter the footnote text./li   /ol   <comment226264> Thank you for your answer, full works :D
