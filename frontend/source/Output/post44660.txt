What is the easiest way to 'save as' in iWork? <body> The 'save as' option in iWork has changed when versions and Lion was introduced.  I often open up a doc make some changes - names, dates, prices - and then wish to save the doc in another location and under another name.  Currently I have to create a duplicate first and then save it with another name.  Is there a simple way of doing this?  <answer44661> The answer is strongNo/strong.  Versions (autosave) is a feature introduced with Lion and the logical continuation of making OS X more like iOS - in this special also more user-friendly.  If you want to save the same document using a different name, you emhave/em to create a duplicate.  Ultimately, you need to find a solution which makes saving as a duplicate faster:  e.g. You can assign a strongshortcut/strong to Duplicate inbrstrongSystem Preferences &#x2192; Keyboard &#x2192; Keyboard Shortcuts/strong.  This way it takes two fast steps to save the same document as a different name:  ol likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdS/kbd to create a duplicate./li likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdS/kbd to save duplicate using different name./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L7S7I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44664> Best practice would arguably be to emDuplicate/em the document the moment you open it, then proceed with your edits. However, sometimes we open a document and start working, only to realize that it's now (in our mind) a "new" document based on the original.  Applications that support Lion's versioning will give you the option to emDuplicate and Revert/em, meaning that they will make a copy of the current document in it's current state, then revert the original document back to its last saved state.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W5oFO.png" alt="image of Byword Duplicate and Revert"  If some unwanted changes have been saved within the original, you can use emRevert/em to restore the original to the state you prefer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mDB1U.png" alt="image of Byword Revert screen"  If a document hasn't been opened for a period of time, it will open in a locked state and you will be prompted to either emunlock/em or emduplicate/em it before you can make changes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DsdJd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44667> Shawn Blanc suggests A Hack to Get Back "Save As" using Keyboard Maestro     With a keyboard shortcut of Command+Shift+S, the macro will select “Duplicate” from the File menu, choose “Duplicate and Revert” for the original document, close the original document, and then open up a Save dialog box for the new document.   <answer44695> Without third party software, the answer is  h1Yes, you can./h1  The caveat is that you'll either need to repeat this for each of your iWork apps, or make it system-wide. I'm presenting the answer for Pages; repeating for Numbers and Keynote is left as an exercise for the reader.  Create a new strongservice/strong in strongAutomator/strong. The service takes strongno input/strong in strongPages.app/strong.The service has a single action: strongDo AppleScript/strong. The script is:  precodetell application "Pages"   tell application "System Events"     keystroke "S" using {command down, option down}     keystroke "S" using {command down}   end tell end tell /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1LhH.png" alt="image of Automator workflow"  Save the service as "Pages Save As." Use the strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong tab within the strongKeyboard/strong pane of strongSystem Preferences/strong to bind the service to kbdCommand/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdS/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voKo7.png" alt="image of Keyboard Shortcuts pref pane"  <answer100599> Go into the File menu and hold kbd&#x2325;/kbd. "Duplicate" should turn into "Save as"  <comment50789> You could also define CMD+S to trigger 'Duplicate'. Then you'll have to redefine the shortcut for 'Save a Version..' and 'Save...' for new documents. <comment56690> can restore to earlier version be quite reliable?  Sometimes I worry about the program being correct (on Windows), not to mention being able to go back and forth to different versions along the timeline <comment56714> I've found the system to be reliable. <comment246938> @Graeme This is THE answer!
