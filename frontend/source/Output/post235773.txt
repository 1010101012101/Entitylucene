Replace updated iBooks (eBook) <body> How can I replace a updated eBook (not via iBookstore) in Apples iBooks-App (on OS X or iOS) without loosing all the associated notes, bookmarks etc.?  For example: Some of O'REILLYs eBooks update quite frequently. I can download the new ePub-Version from their store (NOT Apples iBookstore) and add it to the iBooks-Library. But than I have to delete the old version manually — and loose all the notes, bookmarks etc.. How can I replace the old version with the new one without loosing all my notes etc?  <answer235799> I learned how to export the notes from the iBooks, I'm using to present my seminars at College. I sherched a way to import them to another eBook and i didn't find, i hope Evernote be a good option to you.  Step 1 – Inside iBooks, you can click on a book.
