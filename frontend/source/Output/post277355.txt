I have a MacBook Air and I do not know my administrative password. <body> I have a MacBook Air and I do not know my administrative password. I cannot restart my computer without it. Even if I do not need to restart my computer I still need my admin password to do other things on my computer  <comment349104> Your question is a bit unclear.  Do you mean your *Login Account* password, your *FileVault* password, or your *firmware* password.  What exactly are you seeing?
