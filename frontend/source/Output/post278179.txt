Safari keeps randomly opening as of recent updates, Anyway to know what launched it? <body> I have noticed that Safari is opening almost randomly.  Usually, right after a restart of my computer (I restarted after quitting all applications, with nothing open and Safari is not one of my "startup at login" applications, I have none of those anyways - I disable all of that) - Safari will just "open" to no particular page of any kind - it just opens.  Is there a way to run some kind of log that shows what launched Safari?  Perhaps I should do a malware/virus scan?
