iTunes does not copy some photos <body> iTunes refuses to copy some photos to my iPod with the following message:     Some of your photos, including the photo “somefile.jpg”, were not copied to the iPod “iPod” because they cannot be displayed on your iPod   Note that emloads/em of photos are not copied. How can I know which photos were not copied and strongwhy/strong? They can be displayed perfectly on my mac.  <answer47467> Apple Knowledgebase article strongemIssues when syncing photos to iPhone or iPod touch/em/strong recommends deleting the strongiPod Photo Cache/strong if syncing photos of a known compatible file format results in this message.   <comment54718> Brilliant!
