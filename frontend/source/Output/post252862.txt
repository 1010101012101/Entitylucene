tvOS 10 doesn't show all subtitles in my movies <body> I just updated my AppleTV (32GB) to tvOS 10.0...well, it updated itself, actually. Now movies with more than one subtitle track only show the first track.  For example, I have a few movies with a "forced" track for foreign language translations, and then and the full SDH track.  Sometimes I even have subtitles to match the commentary track(s).  In several movies that I've tried, only the first track is displayed under the "Subtitles" menu (the menu you can access by swiping down while the movie is playing).  It's hard to say, but I'm pretty sure the tvOS update broke this.  I'd noticed in the past that structuring the m4v a certain way affected subtitle track names. I'm wondering if that same structuring is affecting the tvOS update. Is there anything I can do to my movie files to get them to show up on the AppleTV?  Just to be clear: these are movies that I've ripped from DVD/BD myself, encoded with Handbrake, tagged and such with Subler, and added to iTunes manually.
