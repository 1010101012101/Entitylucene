Web clip widget in Notification Center <body> With the old Dashboard it's possible to create a web clip widget from Safari. As it seems like the Dashboard is getting phased out and the Notification Center is definitely a handy place to have widgets, is there any way to get this on macOS Sierra?  I can't seem to find an option for this in Safari and also cannot seem to find anything in the app store.  Does anyone know if there is a way to get web clip widgets in the Notification panel?  <comment339282> What do you want the webclip to do eventually? If you want to display the latest news stories you can do so with other widgets. <comment339286> @oa- I need to display some stats from a cloud based app. Unfortuantely the cloud based app does not have any native apps or widgets for macOS so the only solution that I can see is to have Web Clip widget
