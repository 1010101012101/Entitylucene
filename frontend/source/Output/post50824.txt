Is there a way to access the menubar icons using the keyboard? <body> I know how to use the menu items using only the keyboard. Is there anyway I can access the icons in the top right as well?  <answer50825> If you have "Use all kbdF1/kbd, kbdF2/kbd, etc. keys as standard function keys" strongchecked/strong in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard tab  KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDF8/KBD moves the keyboard focus to the icons in the menubar  If you have "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" strongunchecked/strong in System Preferences → Keyboard → Keyboard tab  KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDFn/KBD + KBDF8/KBD moves the keyboard focus to the icons in the menubar  Although the leftmost user-installed ones on my computer cannot be accessed, you can then use the cursor keys to move KBD←/KBD KBD→/KBD and KBD↓/KBD to bring up the menu associated with the icon.  In addition, KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDF2/KBD (or KBDCtrl/KBD + KBDFn/KBD +KBDF2/KBD) moves keyboard focus to the menubar items.  <comment58227> Ctrl + Fn + F8 works too! <comment58229> @c0smikdebris Ah, yes. Thanks! This means you don't need to check the "Use all F1, F2..." setting if you use the Fn key. Would you mind if I added this to the answer? <comment58242> +1 Coolest thing I've learned all day.
