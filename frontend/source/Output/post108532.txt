Mavericks: MS Word crashing on documents with comments <body> In short, Word crashes silently upon opening certain documents.  The problem seems to be with documents that include Comments.  I have tested by using WinWord to remove the comments from a file that crashed.  After removing the comments, Word opens just fine.   Furthermore, when creating new comments in a fresh document, Word crashes.  I have tried all   ul lireinstalled Word 14.3.8/li lideleting all caches (font and otherwise) using Onyx/li liInstalling latest Java/li lidisabling MS Error Reporting/li /ul  all of which didn't help.  Any suggestions?  <answer115968> Changing preferred language to English (as explained here: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115387) worked for me!
