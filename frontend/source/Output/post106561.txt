'No machine certificates found' when adding machine certificate into VPN <body> I've 2 certificates, one for user authentication and another for machine authentication.  My user authentication includes certificate and private key based on which I've generated pkcs12 file using the following command:  precodeopenssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -inkey private.key -in certificate.crt -out MyPKCS12.p12 -name "Your Name" /code/pre  as suggested here: How can I add a private key to my keychain?  So User Authentication certificate loads fine in VPN configuration, but the problem is when I'm trying to select Machine Authentication. OSX can't find any suitable certificates, even I've imported it into Keychain (ca.crt).  The error says:  precodeNo machine certificates found Certificate authentication cannot be used because your keychain does not contain any suitable certificates. Use Keychain Access to import the appropriate certificates into your keychain. If you do not have the certificates required for authentication, contact your network administrator. /code/pre  How do I load my machine authentication certificate, so can be recognised by Keychain when configuring VPN (ca.crt &amp; tls-auth ta.key)?

Adding a machine certificate to the login keychain will not allow it to show up in the VPN certificate list.  Note: The "System" keychain should not be confused with the "System Roots" keychain.  <comment125107> See also: http://www.securepoint.de/dokumente/How-to_v2007nx_VPN-L2TP-Roadwarrior-MacOSX-e.pdf
