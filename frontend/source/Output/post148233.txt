Xcode 6.0.1 CTRL-Drag from view to source code not working <body> I'm following a tutorial and when I CTRL-drag from the view to the source code in Xcode nothing happens. I get the blue line but when I drop it in the source code I don't get the menu where I can choose options. Please see screenshots: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pVLaJ.png" alt="Project"  When I CTRL-drag the label DSA from the view to the source file on the right side of the editor and drop right after @interface nothing happens. I'm using latest XCode 6.0.1.  I'm supposed to get a menu like the screenshot below (grabbed from the tutorial book)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETvtC.jpg" alt="Expected Results"  <answer148234> your xib file doesn't know its class, try doing this in main.storyboard.   <answer148236> Resolved. Had to associate a class to xib file as per screenshot below: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iw50L.png" alt="Solution"  <comment174677> Your answer pointed me in the right direction. However I'm not using a storyboard.
