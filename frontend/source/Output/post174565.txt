Does a `.hidden` configuration file for Finder exist? <body> Is there a way to hide files and folders from strongFinder/strong like I do with Nautilus using code.hidden/code config file?  On Nautilus I can create a file named code.hidden/code and put inside it a list of files I want to hide.  precode# Example of .hidden file file1.txt directory something else hidden /code/pre  Can I do something similar with OS X Finder without having to prepend a code./code (dot) before the file name?  <answer174571> Use the "hidden" file flag for this:  precodechflags hidden file1.txt directory "something else hidden" /code/pre  See the codechflags/code man page for more info. To see which files are hidden (and other file flags), use codels -lO/code:  precode$ ls -lO total 0 drwxr-xr-x@ 2 gordon  staff  hidden 68 Feb 27 00:52 directory -rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  staff  hidden  0 Feb 27 00:52 file1.txt -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  staff  uchg    0 Feb 27 00:54 lockedfile.txt -rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  staff  hidden  0 Feb 27 00:52 something else hidden -rw-r--r--  1 gordon  staff  -       0 Feb 27 00:53 visiblefile.txt /code/pre  BTW the "@" is there to indicate files that have extended attributes -- the unix-style "hidden" flag also shows up as an old-MacOS-style Finder flag, which is now represented as a bit in the "com.apple.FinderInfo" extended attribute. You can see extended attributes as well with codels -lO@/code, and their contents with codexattr -l filename/code:  precode$ ls -lO@ file1.txt -rw-r--r--@ 1 gordon  staff  hidden  0 Feb 27 00:52 file1.txt         com.apple.FinderInfo    32 $ xattr -l file1.txt  com.apple.FinderInfo: 00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |........@.......| 00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................| 00000020 /code/pre  The "32" means there are 32 bytes of data in the "com.apple.FinderInfo" attribute, and in the full dump the hexadecimal "40" corresponds to the "Invisible" flag in the old-style FinderInfo (/FileInfo) data structure.
