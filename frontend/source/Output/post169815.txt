Traceroute Terminal vs Network Utility different? <body> Why would a Terminal codetraceroute #.#.#.#/code show different results than using Network Utility.app? Here is the first 3 hops. I am connected to PIA VPN but regardless both methods should show the same results I would think.  Terminal  precodetraceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets 1  10.199.1.1 (10.199.1.1)  42.559 ms  39.696 ms  38.293 ms 2  * * * 3  184-75-211-129.amanah.com (184.75.211.129)  49.639 ms 162.219.176.225 (162.219.176.225)  56.780 ms dpaall.webexpressmail.net (162.219.179.65)  69.798 ms /code/pre  Network Utility.app  precodetraceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 64 hops max, 72 byte packets 1  10.199.1.1 (10.199.1.1)  41.221 ms  38.355 ms  47.237 ms 2  vl685-c8-10-c6-1.pnj1.choopa.net (209.222.15.225)  41.262 ms  38.674 ms  41.912 ms 3  vl126-br1.pnj1.choopa.net (108.61.92.105)  44.092 ms  36.200 ms  40.407 ms /code/pre  <answer294407> IP traffic does not necessarily follow the same path. Leaving your system, each router will choose the path that it sees fit for strongeach/strong packet, and this path may change depending on availability/congestion. It won't care stronghow/strong they got there.  So in the case of traceroute that is sending ICMP packets they don't always necessarily follow the same path too, ICMP runs on top of IP.  <comment199593> This is unusual, as I would expect the same system call to be used between them, but I can confirm that I too get different output between Network Utility app and `traceroute` run in Terminal on 10.7 Lion. <comment371571> I also get different results which should not occur. When I do a trace route to 184.75.213.210 via the command line it does not resolve the end point.
