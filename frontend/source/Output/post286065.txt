Discrepancy on disk space between Disk info in desktop and 'df' command <body> I am checking the available disk space using codedf -H/code command I find the results don't agree with the results on the disk info on the desktop.  The info in the desktop says I have 77.12 GB free space but the codedf/code command says only 52 GB free.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yl8dL.png" alt="enter image description here"  I think that the codedf -H/code is the correct one. How to fix the disk info on the desktop?
