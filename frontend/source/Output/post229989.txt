Deleting a phone from iCloud <body> In the manage storage section on my phone, if I delete the backup of another phone from my iCloud, will I lose the pictures currently on my phone that were taken from this other phone?  <answer230002> The photos will remain on your current phone. You're only deleting the backup of a different phone and not affecting the phone you're using at all.  <comment280699> you are deleting backup not the actual contents
