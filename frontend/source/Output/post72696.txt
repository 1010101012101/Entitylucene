Multi display application manuevering <body> In mountain Lion, when you have multiple monitors, if you have multiple desktops enabled, how do you move an application in Mission control to another desktop on a different display.   I can move an application from one desktop on the SAME display, but not on a different display.  I either have to move it to a different display, unclick, then move it to the appropriate desktop, OR move it to the appropriate desktop, unclick, then to the appropriate display.   Ultimately I am trying to rearrange my applications when moving from my laptop when in use by itself, to when I am at work with my multiple screens, and cant get it to have a "Profile" to remember the correct assignments, as described here.
