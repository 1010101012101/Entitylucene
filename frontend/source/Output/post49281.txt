MacBook Pro randomly shutting down <body> I have the latest MacBook Pro and am finding that it is randomly shutting down when switching users. This does not happen every time but has happened 7-10 times since I bought it. Should I get it checked out or is this a common bug in Lion?  <answer49294> There was a firmware update for the MBP that addressed unexpected shutdowns...might try that and see if it solve the problem. Look here   <answer51979> If this continues after applying all OS and firmware updates, definitely take it into your local Apple Store so they can have a look at it.  <comment246439> I've added an answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/204414/unexpected-shut-downs) that offers general guidance.
