Leaving battery in storage <body> I am going to be away from my rMBP for 2 weeks, I powered it off and left it with around 56% of battery charge, anything I should do differently / didn't do? in order to keep the battery in a good condition without causing damage (losing capacity or getting it in too deep discharge state).  <answer264848> That's perfectly ok. You just shouldn't store batteries completely empty for a long time.   <comment332031> Any evidence to back this up? <comment332118> Also, the most efficient long-term battery charge storage is about 2/3. This is the reason that most laptop/phone batteries are shipped to the customer at about that charge.
