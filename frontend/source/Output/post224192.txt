How to mass remove known Wi-Fi Preferred Networks in OS X? <body> In my list of Wi-Fi Preferred Networks I'm able to remove them 1 by 1, but that takes forever. Is there any way to select all the Network Names I want to remove and delete them at the same time?  <answer224195> You can multi-select &amp; delete frombr System Prefs  Network  WiFI  Advanced…br kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd Click to select multiples, then hit the —  button underneath.  Note that this will also clear the same settings from any linked iDevice.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AlZL0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment335162> You just made my day. <comment358357> Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that this removal does not actually become active until you click "Apply" in the Network Preferences window underneath? <comment358358> Nothing in Network prefs activates until Apply is clicked. If Apply is clickable, you need to click it, always.
