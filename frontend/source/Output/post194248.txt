Can I view shared photo albums on the icould.com web interface? <body> I just switched to using the icloud photo library and I enjoy the possibility to view my photos on any computer via the icloud.com web interface. However, my shared albums do not appear there. Is that a limitation of icloud.com or are there any steps I have to take in order to enable shared albums on icloud.com?  <answer230016> You can make any shared album visible on the web.  In Photos, select the shared album, click on your little "head" icon on the top right to get this dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/itsmE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Check Public Website.
