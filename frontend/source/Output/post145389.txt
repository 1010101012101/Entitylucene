Notification window at certain time with traffic jams from work to home <body> Wow, today I saw a great window.  This is a notifier from google maps or apple maps that shows me a way to home from work at certain time (when I usually go home) with traffic jam.  Does anybody know what is it and which app / service show me that window?  I suppose that it can be a google chrome plugin or apple os x service. Not sure  <answer145398> This sounds like the Google Now feature.  If you have chrome installed and running, you can click the alarm-bell-like icon in your menu bar to configure it.  From Google's support page:     h1How Google Now works in Chrome/h1      If you use Google Now strongon your mobile device/strong, you can see certain Now   cards on your desktop computer if you're signed into Chrome, including   weather, sports scores, commute traffic, and event reminders cards.   Some of strongthese cards may be based on the location of your mobile   device/strong. Learn how to sign into Chrome      To see these cards, open the Chrome Notifications Center by clicking   the bell icon  in the system tray on the lower right corner of your   computer screen (on Windows) or in the menu bar on the upper right of   your computer screen (on Mac).   Emphasis added.  Below is a screen shot showing where the bell is on my menubar (YMMV).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTpkU.png" alt="Screenshot showing bell and its position in my menu bar"  <answer179226> Is it possible that it was Apple maps? I see that the Apple Maps application in Yosemite emdoes/em appear in the Notifications center configuration screen (in System Preferences). You can configure it to show as a banner or an alert.   <comment171343> Do you have the Google maps running? <comment171436> sorry, can't see this item, can you add screenshot?
