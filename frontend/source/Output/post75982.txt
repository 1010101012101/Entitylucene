Omnigraffle - how to make double ended arrows? <body> I'm learning Omnigraffle and am ok with most shapes. But I want arrows with heads at each end, like this (done in Pages.app):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fqdhS.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'd also like to know how to put the tips of the arrows where I want, rather than Omnigraffle's default which is to attach a line to a corner:, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IL5Lt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Following Dave Delong's answer below, I realized that you have to style each end of the line.  Like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gC9Vd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer75984> ol liSelect the line (or lines) in your OmniGraffle document/li liOpen the Style Inspector (Inspectors Menu &#x25B8; Styles, or kbd&#x2318;/kbd-kbd1/kbd)/li liSelect the second style inspector ("Lines and Shapes")  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pLJ1R.png" alt="Lines and Shapes Inspector"/li liUse the popup menus to choose an arrow style  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zjBg.png" alt="Arrow styles"/li /ol  <comment88157> Maybe http://forums.omnigroup.com/forumdisplay.php?f=4 is the better place for this? <comment88159> Thanks Dave, I found this but didn't realize you had to style each end of the line separately. I've updated my question to refer this, but thanks a ton for solving it.. <comment88160> Thanks Patrix. I just keep thinking of coming here these days. I find I get better answers, faster, and that includes the developer forums on Apple, and specific product forums. However, if I'm supposed to go to the latter, perhaps the moderators will advise me.
