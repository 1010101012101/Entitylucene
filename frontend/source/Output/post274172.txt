Can I add the music on an iPod to my current account? <body> I had an old account that I lost when my computer died and I synched only a portion of my playlist to a new phone due to memory limits (and lack of knowledge).  I found an iPod that has all of the old music.  Is there anyway to add it to the new account list?  <comment344662> Why did you make a new account for a new device? The logical route would have been to sign into the existing account. We need more detail, OS, machine, versions etc etc etc... <comment344749> I wasn't aware I did.  I still don't know what happened except half of my music disappeared.  Only what was synced to my phone remains.
