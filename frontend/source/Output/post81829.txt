Bookmarks and history always disappear in Safari 6.0.2/Mountain Lion <body> I can not save new Bookmarks in Safari 6.0.2.  The History also disappears when I quit.  Both will be there if minimized but disappear after shutting down or quitting Safari.  Other suggestions have failed to address the issue.  It sounds like a problem with the .plist, but I don't know how to remedy or establish the missing files/folder.  <comment95767> Same happening for me but also icons dont save in dock after reboot OS 10.6
