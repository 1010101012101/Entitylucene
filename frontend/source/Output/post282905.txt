How to rename a service installed by an application? <body> I'm using the Application 'Beyond Compare' on my MacBook and also on my Windows PC. On both OSs you can launch it by the context menu. But while on Windows you see the application's icon in the context men, on OSX you see only a menu entry below 'Services'. And since I have several services active, it's not so intuitive for me to find the entry immediately. So I was thinking about removing the service in a way that I put a special character (e.g. *) in front of the service name so I'm able to detect it at a glance. But how can I do that and is it possible at all?
