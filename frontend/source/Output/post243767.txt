After update OS X EI Capitan, external hard disk format changed <body> I always use the same external hard disk on my Mac formatted as OS X Extended (Journaled). After upgrading my OS, it's recognized as NTFS volume now.  What should I do?  <answer244217> If what you say is true (and I must say, it sounds emextremely/em unlikely), then your only options really are:  ul liEITHER Copy all the data from the external drives, and then reformat them as HFS+ (journaled) and copy the data back./li liOR Leave them as they are./li /ul  There really is not much else you can do with them.  <comment300289> This is impossible.  Upgrading to El Capitan most certainly won't change a hard drive format, especially to a format that is a Microsoft one.  Are you sure that it wasn't NTFS to begin with? <comment300290> Please add a screenshot and the output of `diskutil info /dev/disk1` entered in Terminal.app. Depending on your internal disk and the number of external disks attached you may have to replace disk1 by disk2 or disk3. <comment300904> I have to agree that this does not sound very likely. But without any further information it is difficult to come up with an answer
