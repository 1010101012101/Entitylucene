macOS Calendar 9.0 (2155.15) Displays "Stuck" Reminder Count <body> Regardless of the number of actual Calendar notifications I have visible in the "Inbox" tray within the app, the Dock icon for Calendar always displays a "1" badge.  Per several other questions like this around the Internet, I've tried quitting Calendar and executing codesudo killall Dock/code. This has worked before when I've had stuck notifications, but is not working this time.
