How to avoid OS X halting when network drives are not connected <body> I have set up an AFP drive to be automounted, using the Login Items pane of Users &amp; Groups. But when I now have used my Macbook extensively without any connectivity, I find that a lot of apps wait for maybe 20-30 second timeout before they launch (even though they are not expected to use the drive). There seem to be some system call which invokes the drive, and which blocks further execution until it has timed out.  I presume I can avoid this behaviour by manually removing the AFP mount when I'm disconnected, but does anyone know a better way to keep an AFP mount automatic with a more graceful timeout behaviour that doesn't block apps?
