Connect to Linux File System with default "Connect to Server"? <body> I'm wondering what kind of setup I need on my Linux machine to be able to connect to it using the default "Connect to Server" (command + k) in OSX. I'm going to ask this on askubuntu as well, but I want to see if anyone here knows the server connection types that the default file connections in OSX are?   I only want to change my server setup, not install anything new on my OSX machine. Thanks!  <answer19379> You need to set up either nfs, samba, or netatalk. You can then connect with codenfs:///code, codesmb:///code (or codecifs:///code) or codeafp:///code respectively.  You can also run codeavahi/code for to have your server show up automatically in the Finder via Bonjour.  <comment21278> I already installed netatalk and it works exactly like I wanted with afp. thanks!
