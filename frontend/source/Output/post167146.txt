Which permission for pictures? 644? <body> In order to avoid some non wanted modifications or corruption of pictures files, one possibility is to change the permissions of the files (in code~/Pictures/code).   Do you think that this idea is a good one? And which permissions? code644/code on files and code755/code on directories?  <answer167170> code0644/code is good for pictures. code0755/code is only needed for executable files and directories (thanks,&nbsp;Mateusz).  Note that code0644/code grants read access to all users. If you want to deny read access to other users, then you might consider code0600/code instead.  More info: codeman 1 chmod/code.  <comment195996> all the files are all in your home directory, only you can  access them except you share them via network sharing e.g. so don't worry about it <comment196004> `0755` is also needed for directories.
