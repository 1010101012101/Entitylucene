Why does Google Chrome launch multiple instances of Google Chrome Helper? <body> I have Chrome open (Yosemite 10.1) and there are 7 instances of Google Chrome Helper running. There is a single tab open in the browser. I have 3 extensions installed AND running (1Password, JSON Formatter, and Postman).  Chrome has been a big problem for a while. Different builds have been really solid or really leaky and "crashy". This build (40.0.2214.45 beta (64-bit)) seems pretty unstable. Of course, I see the (beta) tag now and am wondering how to get to a stable release. Maybe that's my issue?  <answer164709> Google Chrome launches multiple instances on my machine here too, so I think that's normal.  If you have the beta or development version of Google Chrome, you can get the normal one here.  Note that because it is a different version it's format is different, you will have to either delete your profile and log in again, or set a different profile path.  <answer164710> Google Chrome Helper instances are used for various plugins you may have installed. Unless a plugin is glitchy or doesn't play nice with other plugins, there is generally no problem having some or many Chrome Helper processes running.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B86Ta.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I7ayG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This Wired article explains a bit about Chrome Helper.  <comment193159> This is what I ended up doing, switched to the final release version. <comment193219> My question is how you got onto a beta build of Chrome without knowing it. <comment193281> I'm sure I knew why I went with Beta when I installed years ago. Probably something to do with testing new features. At any rate, the mistake has been corrected. <comment206018> good point! I uninstalled few extensions and Chrome started working better. <comment345684> the article explains the concepts well but it seems the layout of content setting was changed. I can't find the plug-ins section anymore.
