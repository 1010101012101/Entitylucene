Acer H277H monitor is not charging 2016 MacBook when plugged in via USB-C. Is this possible? <body> My MacBook is connected to monitor via computer's USB-C to monitor's Display Port with one cable.

If the computer is not charging the display will shut off when the MacBook's lid is closed thus requiring me to leave the lid open, which is, in turn, draining power quickly.
