MacBook not recognising internal drives (HD and SSD) <body> A week ago my MacBook crashed. When booting, a folder with a question mark showed up on my screen indicating severe trouble. I tried holding the kbdOpt/kbd key while booting, but the Mac would not recognize any drives. I removed the HDD physically and enclosed it in a external USB enclosure. I could read/write and hence backup the data that way.   I tried:  ul lierasing the disk and making a new recovery disk. The MacBook could not recognize the disk./li liswapping the HDD with a Kingston HyperX SSD 120 GB. The Mac can find the disk, but wonâ€™t install either Lion, Mountain Lion or Snow Leopard on the disk. The installation reports problems with missing elements. I tried both Boot USB (L+ML), Recovery USB (L+ML) and the installation disk (SL). No luck./li /ul  Note: I can read/write on the SSD in the external HD enclosure - so it should not be a SATA controller related problem ...  Stats: late 2009 MacBook 13", all stuff in it is stock from Apple.  Suggestions as to cause and solutions for this issue would be much appreciated!  <answer69970> It's very likely that some internal hardware is down.   Since you said it yourself, the drive works using other interfaces and using another drive inside it doesn't.   Since on a MacBook there is just one mainboard I don't thing you can do something.   <comment81345> Okay - will need to ship it of to the insurance, then! Thanks for the reply, @Matthieu Riegler. <comment81356> What do you mean by "my MacBook crashed"? Was that a physical crash or a software crash? You should try to perform a **[PRAM Reset](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379)** which contains information about the *Startup disk selection*.
