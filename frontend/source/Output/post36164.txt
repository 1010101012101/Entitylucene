Can I get Google Currents on iPad 2 to update automatically when asleep? <body> My iPad 2 usually is usually asleep with its Smart Cover closed. Recently, after leaving it asleep for several days, I took it somewhere without network access and used Google Currents, but found all the articles were several days old. I have Settings  Sync  Update set to Automatic, but apparently that doesn't help if I don't have the device on (or maybe if I don't run Currents). Is there a way to get it to wake up every day and update Google Currents without me having to do it manually?
