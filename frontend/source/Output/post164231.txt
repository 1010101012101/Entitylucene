Disable citrix receiver startup on login <body> I have installed citrix receiver on my home macbook.  It auto starts on login yet it does not show an entry in the emLogin Items/em tab under the emUsers and Groups/em pane of emSystem Preferences/em.  How can I disable the service from starting on login?  <answer166400> The following services are are started at login by codelaunchd/code   precode/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ReceiverHelper.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrix.ServiceRecords.plist /code/pre  You can use codelaunchctl/code to stop the processes like so  precodelaunchctl stop com.citrix.AuthManager_Mac /code/pre  However I am currently unable to prevent launchd from autoloading these services through codelaunchctl/code.  It is irrelevant because the Citrix Receiver App will not start those services when it starts and will therefore not work if they were stopped or disabled.  I did notice these services are unneeded if using the the companies web app.  Considering that one can just delete the above .plist files and only use the web app.
