Get the Sound Output Device Name with AppleScript <body> How can I get the current sound output device name with AppleScript?  For example, in my emSystem Preferences: Sound/em pane "Internal Speakers" is currently selected. All I need to do is retrieve that device name -- "Internal Speakers" or "Headphones" or "Bluetooth Speakers" -- whichever is currently in use.  (I do not need a switcher/changer to another device.)  <answer142415> Something like this.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal pane id "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell application process "System Preferences"         tell tab group 1 of window "Sound"             click radio button "Output"             tell table 1 of scroll area 1                 set selected_row to (first UI element whose selected is true)                 set currentOutput to value of text field 1 of selected_row as text                 display dialog currentOutput             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell  if application "System Preferences" is running then     tell application "System Preferences" to quit end if /code/pre  <answer155965> SwitchAudioSource http://code.google.com/p/switchaudio-osx/ is a command-line utility which works under Lion and Mtn Lion (I don't know about newer OS X versions). If it works for you, then you can use it in an AppleScript, as follows:  precodeon run      set theSwitch to "path_to_SwitchAudioSource"     set theLine to "Current audio output device is:"      do shell script theSwitch &amp; " -c"     display dialog theLine &amp; return &amp; return &amp; result buttons {"OK"}  end run /code/pre  <answer166313> Just to help out a bit more:  In your main user directory /home// create a directory named 'bin' and put  SwitchAudioSource in there.  Here's some AppleScript which switches back and forth between two sources, the default 'headphone' mini jack output on the back of my Mac Mini (a laptop should be different), and my Sennheiser USB headsest.  Call me 'Captain Obvious', but here you go:  `on run  precodeset theSwitch to "~/bin/SwitchAudioSource" set theSource to do shell script theSwitch &amp; " -c"  if theSource = "Built-in Output" then     do shell script theSwitch &amp; " -s \"Sennheiser USB headset\"" else     do shell script theSwitch &amp; " -s \"Built-in Output\"" end if /code/pre  end run`  <comment167798> Thanks! Is there a way do it without having to launch System Preferences? <comment188017> That's a nifty little util! And it works great, even under Yosemite. Thanks!
