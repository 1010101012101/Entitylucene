Fan of my MacBook Air is Running at High Speed and Making Noise <body> I have this noise problem recently. Everything was good a few weeks ago.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iJ0LP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer178706> Reset NVRAM &amp; Reset SMC  If that doesn't help you might want to open up your MacBook (or get it opened up by a technician) to check for dust or other clogging. An Apple Certified Service Provider will also have the ability to do a hardware test, the fan itself could be the problem as well.  <comment211710> When was the last time it was stripped & cleaned? Dust is always the first suspect.
