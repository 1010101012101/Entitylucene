How do I duplicate an audio CD on Lion without importing tracks into iTunes? <body> I want to create an exact duplicate of an audio CD on my Mac (Lion). Is there a way that does not involve to import the CD into iTunes? I just don't want to remember that I have to delete the tracks after copying. And I'm not sure if importing and burning again really creates an exact copy. (Track gaps preserved, and so on)  I tried using Finder, Crtl-click the CD, select duplicate. Ctrl-click the resulting Folder and select burn to CD, but that left my with a data CD containing AIFF-Files.  Any ideas, or AppStore suggestions?  <answer33608> h2Toast ($99)/h2  Lets you capture, copy, convert, share and burn discs  or   h2Burn (open source)/h2  again does the same but a more basic version which is free.  <answer98911> You can use the Disk Utility (included in OS X, codeApplications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Disk Utility/code) to create an image of a music CD. You can then eject the source disk and with the same Disk Utility you can burn the disk image to a blank CD-R.  <comment38310> Do you own the copyright? <comment38311> Does that make a difference to the answer, or are you just trying to remind me, that I should not steal other peoples intellectual property? <comment38313> it does make a difference, if you do not then this promotes illegal activity and is unwelcome on the site, just a disclaimer, see below for software recommendations <comment38316> Oh, yes you are right, I didn't think about that. I just checked and indeed have the right to create a copy in my home country. <comment38317> I know about Toast, it's a great software, but a little overkill for this. So I'll try Burn first. <comment38318> Burn is good considering it's a free piece of software. <comment38319> Burn does the job, thanks a lot. <comment43444> +1 for Toast. I love it! Even if it does cost something. <comment135923> You can't do this with Disk Utility. It's greyed out for Audio CDs. <comment143317> I tried creating an image of the CD using Disk Utility to copy to a blank disk. The problem I encountered was that the disk image created by Disk Utility was larger than the free space available on a standard CD so it didn't allow me to copy the disk image on the CD.
