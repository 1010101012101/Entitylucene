How to set an external display as internal display on Mac? <body> I installed codemacOS Sierra/code as Guest System using codeVirtualBox/code on my MacBook Pro. The problem is that some services I want to use prevent working when I'm connected to an external display. The display provided by codeVirtualBox/code is shown as external display, so the services won't work.   Is it possible to set the external display as internal/built-in display?  Thanks
