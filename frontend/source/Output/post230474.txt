Problems creating OS X installer with AppleScript <body> I’m trying to create a bootable OS X Installer (Including Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan) on an external disk with AppleScript. But now I have some trouble. Here is the code:  precodedisplay dialog "Which version of OS X Installation would you like to create?" with icon caution buttons {"OS X Mavericks", "OS X Yosemite", "OS X El Capitan"} if the button returned of the result is " OS X El Capitan" then     tell application "Terminal"         activate         do shell script "sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --nointeraction"     end tell end if /code/pre  My working direction is:  ol liChoose which version you would like to create./li liActivate Terminal and ask Terminal to execute the code (It works well within Terminal):   precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app --nointeraction /code/pre/li /ol  There is an error (picture below) when I try to run the script. It seems there is something wrong with the path, and it seems AppleScript cannot recognize a path with space like this: codeInstall\ OS\ X\ EL\ Capitan.app/code.   I tried the following script (this one works well)  precodeset pathwithSpaces to "/Users/John/Desktop/This is a test.docx" do shell script "rm -r " &amp; quoted form of pathwithSpaces /code/pre  But my updated one still doesn’t work.  Could you give me some hints? Or am I in a wrong direction?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHejD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer230481> Just a hint how to start but to long to add it as comment:  Start with this:  precodeset the_results to (display dialog "Which version of OS X Installation would you like to create?" with icon caution buttons {"OS X Mavericks", "OS X Yosemite", "OS X El Capitan"}) set button_returned to button returned of the_results if button_returned is "OS X El Capitan" then tell application "Terminal"     activate     set currentTab to do script ("sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app --nointeraction;") end tell if button_returned is "OS X Yosemite" then tell application "Terminal"     activate     ... /code/pre  You still have to handle the codesudo/code password.  <comment281308> You have to escape each backslash with a backslash in the path (i.e. `do shell script "sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ ....` <comment281313> Thanks, Klanomath. It works now. Really Appreciate your help.
