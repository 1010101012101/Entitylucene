Why do chrome pages appear without styling? <body> The Reddit homepage appears like the below screenshot sometimes.   It happens across all different pages and at different times eg Facebook/Google etc - can anyone shed some light on why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wdSM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer34089> My unproven theory is that some of the resources involved in the content have timed out while trying to load.  I just loaded www.reddit.com in Safari and viewed the source, and I see that the style sheet is indeed a separate file: codehttp://www.redditstatic.com/reddit.sgQ89UZYDrA.css/code. So the browser first has to load the main URL (index.html or perhaps a program that generates the content), then the browser locates the stylesheet attribute, and tries to fetch the URL so the style can be applied.
