Buying used Final Cut Pro on eBay <body> If I buy  a copy of Final Cut Pro on eBay that comes in original package with license and registration codes, is it legal to install into my computer? could there be an issue if they previous owner registered the program in their name?  I just want to make sure that I don't break any laws in buying original used software or pay for something that I would not be able to use.
