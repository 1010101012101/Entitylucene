MacBook Pro only Charging when Turned Off <body> My MacBook Pro (2012, Retina) will suddenly not charge when it's turned on.  If I shut it down, it charges normally (orange led, goes green when full).  After I turn it on it keeps the green led on until OSX starts up, then the light goes off.  I haven't seen anything suspicious in the console. I also did a PRAM/SMC reset.  OSX 10.8.3  <answer90280> I went to Apple Support and even though it looked like a software issue, they just exchanged the power supply and now it's working perfectly again.  <comment105935> Have you tried another charger? <comment105943> Charger is in working condition as described in OP. <comment105956> I'd recommend trying a different charger to rule out your charger being the issue here. <comment105962> Unfortunately I don't have another charger. <comment105970> To check if it is the charger (overloaded) without having a spare one: Check if it is getting hot and Reduce the load by minimizing screen brightness to zero. Also look what is the charger model, in Watts. <comment105981> So it was the charger after all.
