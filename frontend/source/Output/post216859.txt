Macbook charge with an iPad charger <body> Can I charge my MacBook (the new one, with the USB-C) with an iPad charger? I forgot my MacBook charger and may not be able to get it in a week. Thanks!  <answer216862> The iPad charger is 10 W and the MacBook charger is 29 W, so you would really be limping along from a power source that's not sufficient. I haven't tested, but my guess is the MacBook won't even try to charge from that small power source.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201700/li /ul  The second hurdle you will face is that you'll need a charging cable to go from the iPad charger's USB A port to the USB C port. This basically will connect the 4 wires the iPad charger uses to the 24 pins that the MacBook expects.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xj0co.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUBdN.png" alt="enter image description here"  I wouldn't count on this doing anything and instead look for an Apple Adapter or third party adapter that adheres to the USB Power Delivery specification - Apple specifically lists that this is supported by the MacBook.  <comment262140> Lightning connector â‰  USB-C. There's also these special things called "voltage" and "current" that make it unwise to use a charger on anything other than its intended device because it might harm the battery. Unless you (or someone here) knows that iPads' and MacBooks' chargers have the same electrical specs I wouldn't charge your Mac with your iPad charger. <comment262146> @Arc676 I don't think there's any danger here other than someone hoping for a charge to happen and it not happening. Connecting USB 2.0 charge to a MacBook that was designed to take power from USB 3.1 won't matter. You're right that 3.1 allows charging voltages of 20V, 12V in addition to the older 5V standard.
