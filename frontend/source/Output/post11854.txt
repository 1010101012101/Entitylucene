How can I get the mic sound feedback in my headphone? <body> I bought a noise canceling headphone yesterday and it works perfectly. The only problem I have is that when I myself talk, I cannot hear my voice correctly. I'm wondered if it is possible to enable the microphone sound feedback in the audio output while the headphone is connected? I have a MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.6 installed.  <answer11863> I use Audacity for recording new sounds, besides being free, it gives you the option for hardware or software Playthrough.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zO5OI.png" alt="Preferences window showing Playthrough settings"  <answer11932> LineIn from Rogue Amoeba lets you route any sound input to any output. Freeware.   <answer120996> You can use GarageBand as well (see this answer) simply create a strongnew project/strong with strongvoice/strong and set monitor to strongon/strong. You don't need to record to hear your voice. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pyW7e.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer267610> Mentioned by User5549 (above). LineIn from Rogue Amoeba lets you route any sound input to any output - strongIt has been updated and now works without a delay in the audio play thru!/strong and it's freeware.  <comment12409> Thanks Nilloc, but it only works while I record a sound in Audocity. <comment100569> I have used this for all sorts of non-critical situations, however if you are going to be monitoring yourself and the lag between when you speak and when you hear your voice becomes distracting, you will want to get a hardware solution that allows less delay in the monitoring. <comment110306> @bmike "hardware solution" do you have any pointers to what that might mean? thanks. <comment110307> I have started using LineIn. So far, it's fine; I find that the delay is very slight and hardly noticeable. We'll see if it starts to bother me over time. <comment110324> @yitz A hardware solution would be something like the Tascam iXZ which takes a XLR input from a Microphone and has a headphone jack to let you listen in before the sound gets to the iPad/Mac. There will be no delay and you can record things while you listen.
