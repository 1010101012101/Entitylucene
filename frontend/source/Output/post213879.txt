Reformat exFat with specific Device Block Size and Cluster Size <body> I have an 512 GB SSD on my MacBook Retina with one of the volumes strongdisks0s6/strong formatted with exFat to use it on both Mac and Windows.  strongdiskutil info disk0s6:/strong  precode   Device Identifier:        disk0s6    Device Node:              /dev/disk0s6    Part of Whole:            disk0    Device / Media Name:      Basic data partition     Volume Name:              WORK    Escaped with Unicode:     WORK     Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Volumes/WORK    Escaped with Unicode:     /Volumes/WORK     File System Personality:  ExFAT    Type (Bundle):            exfat    Name (User Visible):      ExFAT     Partition Type:           Microsoft Basic Data    OS Can Be Installed:      No    Media Type:               Generic    Protocol:                 PCI    SMART Status:             Verified    Volume UUID:              40CF8BFC-3143-3BB9-B659-DE1A62DCA9E6     Total Size:               54.1 GB (54117007360 Bytes) (exactly 105697280 512-Byte-Units)    Volume Free Space:        36.1 GB (36128292864 Bytes) (exactly 70563072 512-Byte-Units)    Device Block Size:        512 Bytes     Read-Only Media:          No    Read-Only Volume:         No    Ejectable:                No     Whole:                    No    Internal:                 Yes    Solid State:              Yes /code/pre  I have lots of small files in that volume and my small files took to much physical space so I want to reformat the volume with a minimum Device Block Size and Cluster Size so my small files won't take any additional space. How can I do that in OS X?  Here is an example of files in folder codebower_components/code which is code46.1 MB/code taking code9.75 GB/codespace on the disk(printed from windows):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OOGG8.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUPDATE 1/strong  I didn't found a way how to check cluster size on Mac so I boot in Windows and run codechkdsk/code on that drive: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6SAQl.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you can see 131072 bytes in each allocation unit - that is my current cluster size being created by Mac DiskUtil default   strongUPDATE 2/strong  Just booted back to Mac and run the command codesudo newfs_exfat -N /dev/disk0s6:/code  precodeReformatting existing ExFAT volume Partition offset : 871407616 sectors (446160699392 bytes) Volume size      : 105697280 sectors (54117007360 bytes) Bytes per sector : 512 Bytes per cluster: 131072 FAT offset       : 2048 sectors (1048576 bytes) # FAT sectors    : 3328 Number of FATs   : 1 Cluster offset   : 6144 sectors (3145728 bytes) # Clusters       : 412856 Volume Serial #  : 0227bd88 Bitmap start     : 2 Bitmap file size : 51607 Upcase start     : 3 Upcase file size : 5836 Root start       : 4 /code/pre  So looks like chkdisk showed same code131072/code bytes per cluster  <answer213888> The maximum allocation block (or cluster) count for exFAT is 2^32 = 4,294,967,296.  To get the minimal size of an allocation cluster on your partition divide the size of your partition through 2^32.  Examples:   ul lifor a 100 GB partition the minimal size is 100,000,000,000 bytes/4,294,967,296=~23.3 bytes. Since the smallest device block size is 512 bytes, the allocation block size can't be smaller./li liFor a 3 TB partition the minimal size is 3,000,000,000,000 bytes/4,294,967,296=~698.5 bytes. The minimal possible allocation block size is then 1024 bytes. /li /ul  To format a partition use codenewfs_exfat [options] /dev/disk*s*/code  The following options regarding allocation block sizes are available:  precode -b bytes-per-cluster          File system block size (bytes per cluster).  Acceptable values          are powers of 2 in the range 512 through 33554432.   -c sectors-per-cluster          Sectors per cluster.  Acceptable values are powers of 2 in the          range 1 through 65536.  /code/pre  To reformat your exFAT volume first copy the content to another volume. Then enter:  precodediskutil list #to get the disk identifier of the exFAT partition diskutil unmount /dev/disk0s6 sudo newfs_exfat -c 1 -v exFAT /dev/disk0s6 diskutil mount /dev/disk0s6 /code/pre  The command will create one allocation (or cluster) block/device block and rename the volume to emexFAT/em.  Alternatively you may use  precodesudo newfs_exfat -b 512 -v exFAT /dev/disk0s6 /code/pre  hr  Most modern HDDs or SSDs use device block sizes of 4096 bytes and the displayed device block size of 512 bytes is only a "logical" device block size probably for compatibility reasons. So a minimal allocation block size of at least 4096 bytes is recommended.  Also the default cluster block sizes of  various sized exFAT partitions in Windows "mention" at least 4 kb.  hr  To get the current cluster block size (and other informations) of an exFAT volume do the following:  precodediskutil list #to get the disk identifier of the exFAT partition diskutil unmount /dev/disk0s6 sudo newfs_exfat -N /dev/disk0s6 diskutil mount /dev/disk0s6 /code/pre  <comment258156> how can I check what is the current cluster size? I can see that my Device Block Size 512 Bytes but cant find a way to check what is the current cluster size. <comment258157> @Riapp added explanation how to get the current values <comment258158> Just updated the question with details. Looks like my cluster size is 131072 bytes which is was being created by Mac DiskUtil by default.
