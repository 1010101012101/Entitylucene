Enable flash player audio access in safari for a website permanently <body> I get this request every time I try to use the microphone on the same web page. Is there anyway to set this so it stops asking for this domain. I understand the security ramifications; however I believe I can trust the site.  It would be nice to access this page without having to answer this on every entry on the page.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttmG5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer142376> Flash has a control panel is system preferences that you can make these settings changes.  In my version (admittedly older) there is a tab for "Camera and Mic" where you can manage camera and microphone settings by site/  <comment167727> I spent so much time looking in Safari's preferences that it didn't strike me to check the Sys Prefs. I'm embarrassed at this considering how long I've been a Mac user (and dev) Thanks.Big plus 1 and thanks.
