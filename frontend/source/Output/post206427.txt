Can you see a list of all open tabs in Safari? <body> I often have a good 150 to 200 tabs open in Safari at all times because this is where I like to keep all my current work. Obviously, all open tabs are never displayed at the same time when there are so many...   I am wondering if a list of all currently open tabs is available in Safari.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qMq3X.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer206441> Here is an AppleScript that will get the name of all Tabs in all Safari windows and show them in an unsaved TextEdit document.  You can save this as a plain script and access it from the Script menu on the Menu bar if you enable it in Script Editor's Preferences.  Or as an App and it can be placed on the Dock.  precodetell application "Safari"     set windowCount to number of windows     set docText to ""     repeat with x from 1 to windowCount         set tabcount to number of tabs in window x         repeat with y from 1 to tabcount             set tabName to name of tab y of window x             set docText to docText &amp; tabName &amp; linefeed as string         end repeat     end repeat end tell tell application "TextEdit"     activate     make new document     set the text of the front document to docText end tell /code/pre  The above source code was modified from Generate a List of Open Safari Tabs with AppleScript.  <answer206451> I don't believe there is a list of tabs available, however, there is a tab overview in Safari if you click     View  Show All Tabs    The keyboard shortcut is kbdShift/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbd\/kbd  Which will show you all of your tabs, grouped by which website they are.   Or if you have pinch-to-zoom support, you can zoom out and it will automatically jump into this view.   <comment248921> This is great! I didn't know this feature was there. I guess I could have searched for it but sometimes it's hard to search for something you don't know exists. I like your answer better because of the visual result that comes in this list, but the other answer is good too!... <comment248922> Great answer, thanks! Definitely a tie with the other answer. Thanks a lot, I appreciate! <comment249072> I agree, it is definitely something hard to search for. Apple likes to hide a lot of features like this. @fabriced <comment322481> Uh, no. "Show All Tabs" does *not* show all tabs. It shows the tabs in the current window. <comment332785> Somehow this stopped working in Sierra <comment332836> @IvanBalashov I'm running Sierra 10.12.2 and it appears to be working fine on my end. <comment333609> @jroschen In `View` menu it is shown as `Option`+`Shift`+`Command`+`:`. It works if I click it in menu, but shortcut doesn't work. There must be some conflict, but I have no idea where to look (except system prefs, but nothing  there). <comment333613> @jroschen I went to System Prefs, and added custom application shortcut, and it worked! The only catch was I had to type the menu item with localisation which is French for me (`Afficher tous les onglets`)
