IPad for lightweight vacation computing? <body> Vacation computing for me these days seems to have fairly few requirements that my phone alone can't easily support:  ol liOffloading raw SLR photos from SD card to clear space and post online (often to facebook)/li liOffloading, editing down, and posting videos (facebook)/li /ol  Is the iPad a suitable, flexible, enjoyable device for this sort of thing? If so, are there any apps or workflows that help?  <answer5428> There are a lot of pro photographers who've started using the iPad for their first pass of editing. Vincent Laforet, who is highly respected wrote about his use of them at "Using the iPad on set". Also "12 Best iPad Photo Apps" has some suggestions.  <answer5739> You can import photos using the iPad camera kit: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC531ZM/A  <comment5547> Stop working, start enjoying.

Vince Laforet is one of the most respected photographers out there and he shows how he uses one of his iPads on a shoot for video, and stills.
