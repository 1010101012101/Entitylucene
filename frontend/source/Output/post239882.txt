What are the keys corresponding to the shortcut? <body> I'm trying to figure out how to use my Apple keyboard at times instead of the mouse. What keys do I press for the following shortcut?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0Jrx.png" alt="Delete document menu command"  <answer239883> Apple's Help menu in the finder has an article titled What are those symbols shown in menus? - the related articles at the bottom are great reading. Your specific answer is:  kbdshift/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbddelete/kbd  The up arrow â‡§ is the kbdshift/kbd key and the symbol with the [X] is the Forward delete symbol.  Typed kbdfn/kbd+kbddelete/kbd.   Refer to Mac keyboard shortcuts for further information on the symbols.   <answer242546> The symbol with the X is the delete key, the up arrow is the shift key, a small up arrow (about the size of ^ ) is the control key, and the command key's symbol can be found on the keyboard above the word "command" on the key.  The img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1TgDy.png" alt="Option or Alt key" key is the option/alt key.  <comment298412> How does this improve on other answer?
