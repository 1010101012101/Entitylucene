First boot hangs after updates <body> I recently deleted the setup assistant app from my El Capitan install. Now, whenever OS X updates, it logs me in to a black screen and hangs there. Killing the machine with the power button and booting up again makes the login process work as expected.   I'm assuming the black screen is due to the OS trying to run the setup assistant on the first login after the update. My question is, is there anything useful the setup assistant does after an upgrade, or does it just re-ask you to try icloud drive?  If it is useless, is there a way to stop it from trying to open after each update?  <comment258263> I'd be more inclined to wonder why you felt it necessary to delete **anything** that lives in a folder called "CoreServices" & expect to get away with it. For the 20MB space it was taking up, you could have deleted a selfie or two instead. <comment258642> I own a MacBook Air and have limited space. I've cleaned out wallpapers, screensavers, quicktime demos, fonts, dictionairies, apps I don't use, etc. as to slim down the size of the base install.   The recommendation to get rid of setup assistant comes from this article. Its dated 2008, so things may have changed since then (which is why I'm asking the above question). I've been doing this since Snow Leopard and this is the first release that's given me issues with setup assistant not being there. http://arstechnica.com/apple/2008/11/five-ways-to-slim-down-your-mac-os-x-install/
