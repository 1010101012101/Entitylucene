Tap to click on only one trackpad? <body> Is there a way to configure the Magic Trackpad with tap-to-click without having tap-to-click on the built-in trackpad of a MacBook Air?  <answer9268> Have you already taken a look at MagicPrefs (free)? It lets you assign custom actions to various gestures and touches, maybe this will let you realise what you want. Since I don´t have a Magic Trackpad near me, I can´t verify this though.  <comment9850> MagicPrefs seems to fit the bill; so unless I find some problems after testing it a bit, I'll accept this.
