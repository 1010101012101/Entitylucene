My contacts' numbers have been changed to add a hyphen after the third number <body> My contacts' numbers have been changed to add a hyphen after the third number.br I am in the UK and so a London number which is 0208 shows up now as 020-8, which I think is Sweden?    If I add a new number in the Contacts app the same thing happens and the only way around it is by making it an international number (e.g. +44).  Any ideas please?  <comment358171> The area code is 020, the rest that follows is the 'number' itself. the 7 or 8 is not part of the London area code [whatever most people might think]
