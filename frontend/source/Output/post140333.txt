Multiple kernel panics per day on MacBookPro4,1 2008 mostly in web surf mode <body> I've had freezing issues more and more frequently (now multiple per day) with my early 2008 Macbook Pro 4,1  I've pasted a recent kernel panic log beneath, and hope someone can point me in the right direction.  This problem was happening on OS X 10.6 recently, and I did a Rember test on the memory which looked "ok", as well as verified the hard drive in single user modeâ€”also checked out "ok".  I've since done a clean install of 10.8 but the problem persists. Other stuff that may/may not be related: optical drive is dead, and the battery barely holds a charge any more :/ maybe 6 years is enough for this baby  precode Machine-check capabilities 0x0000000000000806:  family: 6 model: 23 stepping: 6 microcode: 1548  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T9500  @ 2.60GHz  6 error-reporting banks  threshold-based error status present Processor 0: machine-check status 0x0000000000000005:  restart IP valid  machine-check in progress MCA error-reporting registers:  IA32_MC0_STATUS(0x401): 0x1000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC1_STATUS(0x405): 0x0000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC2_STATUS(0x409): 0x0000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC3_STATUS(0x40d): 0x0020000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0x0000000000000011 invalid  IA32_MC5_STATUS(0x415): 0xb200001806000e0f valid   MCA error code:            0x0e0f   Model specific error code: 0x0600   Other information:         0x00000018   Threshold-based status:    Undefined   Status bits:    Processor context corrupt    Error enabled    Uncorrected error Processor 1: machine-check status 0x0000000000000004:  machine-check in progress MCA error-reporting registers:  IA32_MC0_STATUS(0x401): 0x1000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC1_STATUS(0x405): 0x0000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC2_STATUS(0x409): 0x0000000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC3_STATUS(0x40d): 0x0020000000000000 invalid  IA32_MC4_STATUS(0x411): 0xf200000000060151 valid   MCA error code:            0x0151   Model specific error code: 0x0006   Other information:         0x00000000   Threshold-based status:    Undefined   Status bits:    Processor context corrupt    Error enabled    Uncorrected error    Error overflow  IA32_MC5_STATUS(0x415): 0xb200003008000e0f valid   MCA error code:            0x0e0f   Model specific error code: 0x0800   Other information:         0x00000030   Threshold-based status:    Undefined   Status bits:    Processor context corrupt    Error enabled    Uncorrected error panic(cpu 1 caller 0xffffff8001cb8389): "Machine Check at 0x51ce37a4f09a70c0, registers:\n" "CR0: 0x0000000080010033, CR2: 0x000000005aae0000, CR3: 0x000000002b9bb000, CR4: 0x0000000000000660\n" "RAX: 0x3f63e0cb68ad5356, RBX: 0x0000002300000000, RCX: 0x9f7eb0c600000000, RDX: 0xbffb0ed0bffb0e58\n" "RSP: 0xf4692a1fbaab5046, RBP: 0xbffb0e1000000000, RSI: 0x0000002300000023, RDI: 0x000000000000000f\n" "R8:  0xbffb0eecbffb0ecc, R9:  0x0478021800000001, R10: 0x5aae0000bffb0e98, R11: 0x0021028600000000\n" "R12: 0x0000001b00000000, R13: 0x01ab378b00000000, R14: 0x00000000ffffff80, R15: 0x01cced7000000000\n" "RFL: 0x10b24c7051b04c20, RIP: 0x51ce37a4f09a70c0, CS:  0x000000000000b18d, SS:  0x000000000000a30e\n" "Error code: 0x1dfaf9b50de147ea\n"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2050.7.9/osfmk/i386/trap_native.c:280 Backtrace (CPU 1), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff8074e25f20 : 0xffffff8001c1d5f6  0xffffff8074e25f90 : 0xffffff8001cb8389  0xffffff8074e26100 : 0xffffff8001cced7f   BSD process name corresponding to current thread: Google Chrome He  Mac OS version: 12A269  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 12.0.0: Sun Jun 24 23:00:16 PDT 2012; root:xnu-2050.7.9~1/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: 8D5F8EF3-9D12-384B-8070-EF2A49C45D24 Kernel slide:     0x0000000001a00000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff8001c00000 System model name: MacBookPro4,1 (Mac-F42C89C8)  System uptime in nanoseconds: 4887982849617 last loaded kext at 1927504231579: com.apple.filesystems.smbfs  1.8 (addr 0xffffff7f83d9d000, size 229376) last unloaded kext at 176428418700: com.apple.driver.AppleFileSystemDriver  3.0.1 (addr 0xffffff7f83cb1000, size 8192) /code/pre  <answer140394> You log shows codeGoogle Chrome He/code as the problem maker.  Reinstalling the OS would not fix that since it is Chrome problem.  As for the problem solving, try following:  ul liUncheck the 'Enable hardware acceleration' checkbox to disable hardware acceleration for the Flash player in Chrome./li liFollow this instructions to Resolve Kernel Panics./li /ul  Why did I recommend to test in Safe mode (in the comment above)     Rule out incompatible third-party kernel extensions, Startup Items,   and Login Items.      Start up in Safe Mode and use your Mac normally for a time to see if   the panic recurs. Third-party kernel extensions, Startup Items, and   Login Items are not loaded in Safe Mode. Note that running in Safe   Mode may prevent you from using third-party hardware that depends upon   associated third-party kernel extensions.      If the problem does not recur, then this implies a third-party kernel   extension, Startup Item, or Login Item may be the cause.      You can identify third-party kernel extensions by examining the panic log and then troubleshooting them by process of elimination. You   may also be able to identify the culprit by following steps 5 and 6   below.      To rule out corrupted or incompatible Startup Items or Login Items, follow the procedure specified in our "Troubleshooting Startup   and Login Items" FAQ to ascertain if these are causing kernel panics.   <comment165464> Run in Safe mode to see. <comment165480> regarding running in safe mode, if the panic/freeze typically happens while surfing the web, and safe mode effectively makes surfing the web impossible, is that an effective test? I've tried it before... no freeze... Elaborate for me if you can. <comment165492> Safe mode would only tell if there is a more serious problem with HW/SW. Where in your Question did it say it only happens in web mode? I missed that. <comment165657> thanks, was thinking of another forum post...
