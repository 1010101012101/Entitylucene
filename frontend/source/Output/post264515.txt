Why did Apple remove CapsLock from the active Hebrew keyboard in Sierra? <body> Hebrew vowels are normally typed with the CapsLock activated.  Why did Apple remove CapsLock from the Hebrew keyboard in Sierra without explaining or showing how to type Hebrew vowels?   In other words, how does Apple want the Hebrew user to write Hebrew vowels?  <comment331545> This is NOT a duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/255519/how-can-i-make-caps-lock-work-like-it-did-prior-to-sierra  That question does not cover Hebrew vowels, which do not work in Sierra with caps lock.  I do have an answer for this. <comment331548> If you are talking about the Hebrew PC keyboard, I think you can still make vowels via option plus shift.  Does that not work for you? <comment331550> @Tom This was closed as a duplicate of the other question this same user posted half an hour before. Questions shouldn't be reposted. I acknowledge your comments over on the other question this user posted to which you also commented. <comment331565> @grgarside  Thanks!  Hopefully the other one will get the necessary number of votes.  This one is actually better written than that one.
