How do I avoid inadvertently switching workspaces? <body> I keep accidentally dragging windows into other workspaces on my Macbook Air running OS X Lion.  Can I disable dragging into other workspaces or make doing so more difficult?  <answer55229> With the Warp pref-pane, you can set a delay and/or require a modifier key(s) to allow a space change.  <answer55234> There's a hidden preference for adjusting the delay in seconds:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-edge-delay -float 0.5 osascript -e 'quit app "Dock"' /code/pre  It can be set to an arbitrarily high value to disable dragging windows to other spaces.  <answer76418> TinkerTool has this option in the Applications tab, Mission Control, Delay when dragging window to adjacent space: Default / Short / No Delay.br No Delay was selected on my computer, but I don't remember if I chose that at some point. I looked into this because I wanted the "windows aero snap" feature, I just found and installed Cinch by Irradiated Software. The Spaces "swipe" would happen before Cinch was able to do its thing.
