Bulk Download Pictures from Messages <body> So unbelievably I have emnever/em cleared my history in SMS/iMessages/Messages. Ostensibly, I should be able to scroll up and eventually see my first text message from my first gen iPhone. This is, unsurprisingly, taking up a considerable amount of space on my phone, but a big part of why I've never cleaned it out is that it contains a tremendous number of pictures of my daughters my wife has sent me over the years. It doesn't seem like these get saved to my photo roll and there doesn't appear to be any way to bulk export them. It may be worth noting that I use desktop messages in Yosemite and it seems work well, so there may be an approach I can use from that angle.  What's the best way for me to archive all the photo attachments from almost seven years of text messages?  <answer191874> I had this same issue and was able to resolve it by extracting the data from a backup. I used the script (accessible via link) to accomplish this.

Thanks for getting this one in there. <comment228419> @grovberg glad I could help! I opened a thread on Meta to discuss when questions should be marked as duplicates. If you'd like, you can view the thread over there. Else, again glad I could help! <comment228671> Let's see about reopening this. @grovberg - mind if I reference the linked article or just remove the part about how to back the data up? This seems more about using the iTunes backup files so you feel free to delete messages on iOS. Am I reading you both correctly here?
