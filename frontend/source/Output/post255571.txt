MacBook Unibody 2009 Battery Issue <body> I have a MacBook Unibody 2009 and am facing a weird issue.  My laptop only works when it's connected to a power source but not on battery.  As most of us would, I thought the battery was gone so I bought a new battery. However, after charging it I still had the same issue.  So, I took it to a repair person whom I know and he told me it's some issue on the motherboard. Now I am not very sure how accurate his diagnosis is.  Does anybody here know of or have a similar issue concerning MacBooks? Can anyone share some information on this?  <answer255581> the issue is with either your SMC, or the LION charging system, it is possible that the computer is not aware of the battery, boot up the computer, and click on the battery icon, does it give a battery status?  Take it to a professional! Apple computers are complicated, and you should not be trusting your very expensive Mac with someone you do not trust.   No doubt Louis Rossman will have a video about this...   <answer255584> Have you tried resetting the SMC?  strongReset the SMC/strong  It's easy to reset your computer's System Management Controller (SMC). The instructions for resetting the SMC on a MacBook depends on two things:  ul liDoes your device run from a removable battery? strong(Yes in your case)/strong/li liDoes your device run from a built-in battery?/li /ul  Now, for the sake of others who may come here looking for answers to the same issue, I will provide the process for both.   strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Hope this helps.

Thanks for your response though, appreciate :) <comment318706> Its showing me the charged percentage, everything looks perfect but its just not working when I removed the power source. <comment318708> does it say that the battery needs replacing?  It does sound like an issue with the SMC, did you try reseting it? have you tried contacting Ifixit?
