MacBook Air (2013) doesn't restart or shutdown after upgrading to OS X 10.10 Yosemite <body> My MacBook Air (2013) doesn't restart or shutdown from the Finder menu after upgrading to OS X 10.10 Yosemite. I have to press the power button.  Moreover, it shows the Apple logo and progress bar loads for few seconds and then starts normally but could not restart or shutdown.  <comment177746> By "gage" do you mean spinner or progress bar? <comment178346> @alexy13 I changed that to be “progress bar” since there is nothing else it could be. <comment182550> You probably want to have a look into the LaunchD [shutdown log](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/48226/how-do-i-find-the-log-for-the-shutdown-process/) or did you installed Parallels some time ago? Then take a look at [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6603318).
