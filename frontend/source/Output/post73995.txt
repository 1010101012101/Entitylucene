How do I lock the screen using a keyboard shortcut on OS X Mountain Lion with a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000? <body> Title says it all: how do I lock the screen using a keyboard shortcut on OS X Mountain Lion with a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000?  <answer74006> Assuming your keyboard has an eject button, you need to go to System Preferences, and click on "Security &amp; Privacy", then click on the "General" tab, then select the checkbox that says "Require password immediately after sleep or screensaver begins". Now you can lock your computer by pressing kbdControl/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdEject/kbd. This puts the computer to sleep, but because we've told it to lock on sleep, it also locks it.  If your computer doesn't have an eject button, you will need to create your own custom shortcut. Unfortunately, you can only create shortcuts for menu items and services. Fortunately you can create a service to put the display to sleep (and thus lock the screen), and you can assign a shortcut to the service. For instructions on how to do this, see this Macworld page.  <answer74066> You can also log out to the fast user switching screen, but it doesn't turn off displays. Just assign a shortcut to this shell command:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend /code/pre  If you have the Alfred Powerpack, you can give the lock action a shortcut in the hotkeys tab:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/STsoe.png" alt=""  <answer79078> I used KeyRemap4Macbook to remap the kbdpause/break/kbd key to kbdeject/kbd.  KeyRemap4Macbook is free, and it shows up in System Preferences after installing.  kbdshift/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdpause/break/kbd does the trick now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FmEIf.png" alt="screenshot from keyRemap4macbook"  **Please note that KeyRemap4Macbook is now called Karabiner with the same functionality.  **update for Sierra - Karabiner ** img src="https://i.imgur.com/ECWyTOX.png" alt="new karabiner edit"  <answer79128> You do not need to use Third Party Apps to set a global short cut. You can use Automator Services,System Preferences keyboard Shortcuts and the CGSession -suspend command that switches to a login screen.  Use the Applescript :  precodedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend" /code/pre  in a Automator 'Service' like this with the set up as no input and all applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UFSZw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Save it and then go to the Keyboard System Preferences. - Keyboard Shortcuts tab.  Select Services on the right. And scroll down to the bottom on the left to 'General'. There you will see your service. Click the addShortCut. And give the service a shortcut. Clost system prefs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8cOII.png" alt="enter image description here"  You may need to quit some apps and re open them first for them to pick up the short cut for the first time. You can see the ones that have already picked it up..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4bF2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now try the shortcut from the keyboard.  <answer90941> You can easily add the padlock icon to your menu bar:  precodeopen /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app/Contents/Resources/Keychain.menu /code/pre  You can also add it through Keychain Access prefs. ;)  <answer98461> Control+Shift+Eject is the keystroke for Macs with an Eject key, and for external keyboards Control+Shift+Power is the keystroke for Macs without the eject key, like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro Retina  http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/17/lock-screen-mac/  <answer112094> You can install the tiny, free SleepDisplay application, and assign it to any key in the Microsoft Keyboard section of System Preferences.   <answer122555> @markhunte's answer is good, but it falls short when you're in an app that doesn't have a "Services" menu (e.g., Calculator).  Instead of using System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts to assign the shortcut, I use Apptivate: it's a free, lightweight utility whose only purpose is to run a command when you press a hotkey sequence.  Once you've created a "Lock Screen" service in Automator (as described by @markhunte's answer), you simply add it to Apptivate:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/frfIJ.png" alt="Empty Apptivate menu"  When the "Open" dialog is displayed, press kbdCMD/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbdG/kbd (Go to Folder) and enter code~/Library/Services/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qi8JQ.png" alt="Go to Folder dialog"  Then select the Automator service you created earlier:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGyq0.png" alt="Select Automator service"  Finally, assign a keyboard shortcut to the service:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RbVlm.png" alt="Apptivate keyboard shortcut menu"  And that's it!  Now you have a "Lock Screen" keyboard shortcut that can be used in emany/em application.  <answer123839> Or you can go to: strongApplications  Utilities  Keychain Access  Preferences  Show keychain status in menu bar/strong.  This will put a lock in your menu bar and you can click strongLock Screen/strong to lock your screen. If you need a keyboard shortcut, you can add this in your keyboard under Settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnuWk.png" alt="Keychain Access menu"  Also, here are steps to use a shortcut to put your computer in screen saver mode which locks your Mac at the same time.  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong./li liSelect strongGeneral/strong./li liBe sure strongRequire password [immediately] after sleep or screen saver begins/strong is selected./li liGo to your applications folder./li liOpen strongAutomator/strong./li liSelect strongServices/strong on the screen that appears./li liAt the top of the new Service's actions, in the Service receives drop-down, select strongno input/strong from the options. Make sure that strongany application/strong is selected in the second drop-down. /li liAdd the strongStart Screensaver/strong action (in the Utilities group of actions) to the Service by dragging it to the right. /li liSave the Service (Automator does not ask you where to save it, just to name it codeLogout/code for example). /li liNext, open strongSystem Preferences/strong again and select the strongKeyboard/strong preference pane.  Select the strongShortcuts/strong tab at the top, then the strongServices/strong group on the left. /li liThe service you created should be near the bottom of the list of Services under the strongGeneral/strong disclosure triangle. /li liDouble-click on the right side of the entry for the Service you created and assign a keyboard shortcut./li liI chose codeCommand-Shift-L/code for my shortcut./li liExit the keyboard preference pane and give it a try./li /ol  You can always use codeControl+Shift+Eject/code (if you have a mac keyboard) or codeControl+Shift+Power/code on your mac to put your computer to sleep, but I don’t want that when I can just close the mba lid. We all know about hot corners, but I’m not a big fan of it as it always interferes with other options.   I had been using the lock menu icon for the longest time found in strongApplications  Utilities  Keychain Access  Preferences  Show keychain status in menu bar/strong but it just takes too long sometimes to click that small icon when I’m in a rush since the target is so small.  <answer166894> There's a little app which does the trick — http://keylock.io  <answer191316> Ctrl+Shift+PwrBtn  Using an original iMac orange keyboard on a 2011 MacBook Pro.   <answer210878> Note that there's also an alternative method which frees you of remembering obscure key combinations and uses English (or other) words instead: with Alfred or possibly Quicksilver (not sure tho), you can invoke actions such as locking the screen, all via a single hotkey and a bunch of commands in plain language. OSX's Spotlight is moving in the same direction — but I'm not sure if it's quite there yet; though you probably can run AppleScript files with it.  <answer217801> My system version is Yosemite 10.10.5. And the method posted by strongmarkhunte/strong is still working except that you need input username everytime after you suspend the system. It's a little annoying to me. So changed the script from:  precodedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend" /code/pre  to:  precodetell application "System Events" to sleep /code/pre  This script just simulates that you click the sleep menu item of system menu.  <answer249732> Open codeSystem Preferences/code - codeKeyboard/code - codeShortcuts/code - codeApp Shortcuts/code. Click on code+/code. Select codeAll Application/code for codeApplication/code, enter codeSleep/code for codeMenu Title/code, press the desired shortcut in the codeKeyboard Shortcut/code field. Click on codeAdd/code. See the Apple menu (an apple icon in the top left corner). The codeSleep/code entry should show the shortcut you have defined. The shortcut should work right away.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mK8i.png" alt="Screenshot"  Note that Finder and possibly some other applications would only react to the shortcut after the reboot.  <answer286113> If you use the new MacBook Pro or a Windows / external keyboard, use a program like Karabiner Elements to map from a key you choose to "Eject", so that the good old CTRL-SHIFT-EJECT works.  For example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qDQYl.png" alt="Karabiner Elements"  <comment85970> Does your keyboard have an eject button? <comment85974> There is no eject button on the keyboard. (Or if there is, I cannot find it.) Also, I do not want the computer to sleep, only to be locked. <comment85976> As far as I can tell, it does not have an eject button. <comment85981> You can replace the Eject button with the Power button. (If the keyboard has a power button...) <comment85982> The keyboard also does not have a power button. <comment85984> There is an article here which shows you how to create your own custom shortcut. http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090831093941225 <comment120559> Where is the eject key on the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000? <comment125826> I get really weird behavior in Mavericks with this method. <comment125846> weird behaviour like what?? <comment125874> UI is freezing and completely broken like that https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/609809/apple.stackexchange.com/a.79128.7049/login_window_broken.jpg another time UI was broken too but different. <comment146356> +1, this introduces some really useful general knowledge too! thanks! <comment153285> Can I maybe get it to activate the screen saver right away too? <comment153371> @kermit666 yes. use:  `do shell script "/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine"` <comment174063> This answer is not working with `10.9.5` - is there something that needs to be added to Accessibility / Privacy / Assistive Access? <comment174070> It does on mine. Just tested it? <comment213338> Easy, quick and free solution. Thanks! <comment214944> Over a year late, but I added short cut details as requested. <comment218303> Still works on 10.10.3.  You can simplify the Automator script a little, choose "Run Shell Script" (From Utilities section on the left panel of actions), and then paste: `/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend` <comment220820> If you want to immediately sleep your display, you can also just do a similar trick with a different shell command: `pmset displaysleepnow`. <comment242137> I downloaded this and it came with a lot of malware. <comment242347> Can you list specific malware?  I have been using karabiner for three years, installing all updates, and have never had anything extra come along.  Here is the official: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ <comment242359> The creator, Takayama Fumihiko, has this to say:                          "Unfortunately, I don't have enough reputation to comments.  If you can, please tell to mac10688 that he/she must download binary from official site. https://pqrs.org/ And Karabiner is an open source project and designed with security in mind. https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner  " <comment262537> there are 100 articles pointing to a workaround. This is actually the answer I was looking for because I don't freaking want to set the "require password" to "immediately". +100 points <comment264888> What is "Utilities Folder" and where is it located? <comment266487> Go to Applications folder  there you'll see a new folder called Utilities. Open that and you're all set <comment268776> It's a good solution, but unfortunately, it makes the iTunes halt the currently playing track, in contrast to the Keychain "Lock Screen" method. <comment268777> This sleeps the entire computer, it doesn't just lock the screen (and keep it running). <comment332835> Very straightforward on El Capitan. There is no restart required for this to work even for finder. <comment347585> @Glyph how do you map your command to an external keyboard? I have no eject button or power off button. <comment347760> @Pavan - this answer explains exactly that.  If you follow the instructions you will see they don't reference "power off" or "eject", just control, command, and right bracket. <comment360764> This is by far the most simple solution, thank you. <comment370258> When in Finder, my machine was ignoring Control+Shift+L and Command+Shift+L was opening the Library, so I mapped to Command+Shift+Pause/Break and that worked.
