Shut Down or Reboot Your RETINA Mac with a Keyboard Command <body> I have seen a shortcut to shutdown mac using key combinations. It includes the use of kbdeject/kbd key. But since retina macbooks dont have eject key how do I shutdown/reboot the retina mac.br This link is having query regarding puting it to sleep but I cannot see shutdown/reboot. Is pressing power button and selecting the choice the only option I have ??  <answer83769> Just use the kbdpower/kbd button in place of kbdeject/kbd for any keyboard shortcut that worked with kbdeject/kbd (this also applies to older MacBooks, by the way).  <answer278386> To gracefully and quickly initiate a shutdown of a retina mac (or any mac that doesn't have a media eject key) press kbdctrl/kbd+kbdpower/kbd (to display the shutdown dialogue box) you can then release those keys and, since shutdown is the default selected option, just press kbdreturn/kbd to shutdown the mac.  To restart gracefully press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdpower/kbd. Again, this will pull up the shutdown dialogue box but you will have to mouse over to the restart option to select it. This isn't a true 'keyboard shortcut' but I am not aware of one existing.  For many keyboard shortcuts you can use the power button in place of eject, but for the shutdown and restart commands doing so will initiate a hard shutdown/restart and you may loose data.  Note: The kbdctrl/kbd + kbdpower/kbd key combination is the same as holding down kbdpower/kbd and waiting ~2 seconds for the shutdown menu dialogue to appear.
