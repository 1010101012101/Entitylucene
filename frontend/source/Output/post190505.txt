Turning off FileVault <body> I'm currently trying to recover my formatted external hard drive with testdisk.  Testdisk takes forever to load on codesudo/code on Mac Terminal, so I tried to approach it from a live Linux Distro, emGparted/em.  It works so, however it can't write to the Mac HFS+ Drive. At the moment I'm currently trying to partition a separate partition for testdisk to write the recovered files to, however FileVault is in the way.  FileVault is taking forever to finish, (~3 days) and so I followed this  solution and got the following progress.  precodeLogical Volume Family FA9F7FA6-0592-4361-A641-1DAE403816E0     ----------------------------------------------------------     Encryption Status:       Unlocked     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Conversion Status:       Converting     Conversion Direction:    -none-     Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes     Fully Secure:            No     Passphrase Required:     No     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume 21F83719-063D-40EC-8958-36FBD021EE78         ---------------------------------------------------         Disk:                  disk1         Status:                Online         Size (Total):          998973898752 B (999.0 GB)         Conversion Progress:   Paused         Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)         LV Name:               Untitled 1         Volume Name:           Untitled 1         Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Seems like it has started to revert, but it is paused and hasn't actually started the process. FileVault on the Settings pane now shows as paused.  How to make revert process continue?  EDIT:I forgot to mention, the Drive codeUntitled 1/code Is my new 1Tb hard drive, which I have swapped out the Mac's original 500Gb drive. It is made by the same company, HGST, and had the same specifications. So there shouldn't be much capability problems.  <answer190593> The last step in the FileVault conversion process is to restart.  <comment226197> Did you try restarting? <comment226236> Wot. It worked -_-    The one vital step that no one tries. Haha <comment226237> Should I delete this question or would you like to add this as an answer? <comment226309> I'll add it as an answer.
