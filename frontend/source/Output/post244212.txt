Does auto-unlock in macOS Sierra also auto-lock? <body> In WWDC, it was announced that macOS Sierra will have an 'auto-unlock' feature using the Apple Watch whereby if you approach your Mac wearing your Apple Watch, the Mac will automatically unlock.  I don't recall seeing anything about the reverse though?  strongDoes macOS Sierra also have an auto-lock using the Apple Watch?/strong  strongEdit/strong this feature is now in the beta for macOS Sierra (Source)  <comment300905> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this is about unreleased software for which there is no public documentation <comment300911> @Mark I partially agree with you as although Sierra has been released in beta, I don't believe the auto unlock feature is as yet included in that release.  However, I believe the question should be reopened when that feature comes to the beta <comment312761> @Mark since auto unlock is now a feature I think this question deserves to be re-opened
