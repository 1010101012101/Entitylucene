How to retrieve data from my old Apple ID? <body> I want to retrieve data from my old Apple ID. I have signed in my iPhone with my old Apple ID, but iTunes displays an error:      "We cannot complete your iTunes store request. An unknown error occured (0x800B0101)"      "There was a error in the itunes store. Please try again later"    I have tried this many times only to get the same results.  <answer71161> First try changing your iTunes account password via your computer.  Then try logging in again.  If that doesn't work, then try changing the date on your phone temporarily. Go to Settings  General  Date and Time  Set Automatically  Off. Set the date one year ahead. Then try and see if it accepts your password.   If you still can't sign in, contact Apple Store Customer Service at 1-800-676-2775.
