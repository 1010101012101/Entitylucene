Keyboard shortcut for jumping directly to a specific input method <body> I'm leaning Japanese, and so I have my Mac set up for three different input methods: English, and two different Japanese character sets. I can change between the three input methods using ctrl-alt-option-space.   However, because there are three input methods I have to press this key combination a different number of times depending on what the current state is. For example, if I want to switch back to English then I have to press it twice if it's currently set to hiragana, but only once if it's set to katakana. Because of this, I keep pressing it the wrong number of times, which results in typing unwanted characters and then having to cycle back through the three input methods to get to the one I want.  So instead of using one key combination to cycle through the three input methods, I'd like to set up a specific key press for each one. For example, I'd like to set up something like ctrl-alt-command-E that always switches back to English, no matter what the current input method is, so that I can always get to where I want to be without worrying about where I am. But I can't seem to find a way to do this. Is it possible?  <answer80877> One option would be to download changeInput and assign shortcuts to shell commands like codechangeInput U.S./code.  You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_HIRAGANA&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.inputmethod.Kotoeri.Japanese&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_KATAKANA&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;inputsourceid_equal&gt;com.apple.inputmethod.Kotoeri.Japanese.Katakana&lt;/inputsourceid_equal&gt;   &lt;/vkchangeinputsourcedef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;change_inputsources&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;change_inputsources&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::E, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_ENGLISH&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::H, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_HIRAGANA&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::K, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_KATAKANA&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See the private.xml documentation.  VK_CHANGE_INPUTSOURCE_ENGLISH is defined in vkchangeinputsourcedef.xml. You can see the IDs of input sources from EventViewer.app. Without code| ModifierFlag::NONE/code for example the first setting would also apply to control-option-shift-command-E. See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment93719> I would then use a macro utility like Keyboard Maestro to run the shell scripts with your own keyboard combos.
