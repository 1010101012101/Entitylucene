How to specify between identical menu command names when making custom shortcuts. <body> I commonly set custom keyboard shortcuts in System Prefs.   I tried setting a shortcut (codecommand-shift-a/code, mirroring codecommand-shift-j/code to move to junk) for Mail app to move messages to archive, since the default shortcut is rather weird (codecommand-control-a/code).   But the menubar command is "Message / Archive", so what I enter in "System Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / App Shortcuts" becomes simply "Archive". Thus it's getting confused with "Mailbox / Go to Favorite Mailbox / Archive".   Is there a way to specify which is which, to avoid the naming collision?   <answer236523> I found the answer on MacStories; it's also on SuperUser.   Colliding menubar command names can be specified via their nesting tree, using code-&gt;/code. Thus the shortcut name in my original question becomes codeMessage-&gt;Archive/code.
