OS X : Terminal command to turn ON/OFF SSH server <body> I know how to turn on SSH server from System preferences :-  (System preferences -  Sharing - Remote Login )   Now I am looking for a terminal command for the same.   By knowing it I can use the command in my Python Script (for project work).   <answer237040> You can stop the ssh service by typing the following:  precode$ sudo launchctl unload  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist  /code/pre  To start it again, use this:  precode$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist  /code/pre  <comment290208> Did you even try googling, e.g. "_os x terminal start stop ssh_"? The top hit was [How to start/stop/restart launchd services from the command line?](http://serverfault.com/questions/194832/how-to-start-stop-restart-launchd-services-from-the-command-line) and while it was a generic question the accepted answer was essentially what jherran provided although it went a bit farther explaining "_some of the services (sshd for example) are disabled in the configuration file so you will need to use the '-w'switch when loading them._". <comment290209> I am new to all this. I didn't know launchd and 'starting SSH from Terminal' are correlated. And there are thousands of generic questions like these which are asked in different ways.
