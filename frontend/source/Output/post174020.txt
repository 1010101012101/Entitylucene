Had 40 loaded so perhaps too many to cope. That sorted it for me :)  <comment204854> Have you gone to settings/general/keyboard/keyboards and used the edit button to delete the Emoji keyboard and then used Add Keyboard to add it again? <comment204861> Only thing I can add is English uk qwerty nothing else :( <comment204863> You should be able to add a couple dozen keyboards. Try resetting your device <comment204866> Done now .. Thanks for the help  <comment235315> This is called a "Globe icon." It looks like a globe. In iOS 8, Emoji's weren't standard; they had to be enabled through "Settings - General - Keyboards - Emoji". Since "Emoji" was a type of different keyboard language, it was pretty much another locale, and that was the reasoning behind that original globe icon. In the development for iOS 8, since most of these Emojis are smileys, they replaced the button with a smiley-face. <comment235317> Nice, thanks... with a lot of imagination, I can see the "globe" now ;)
