Sound card (Audionengine D1) not working on new MacBook Pro Retina <body> My soundcard (USB DLC Audioengine D1) is not working on my new MacBook. My old MacBook Air from 2012 has no problem with it.  When plugged in the device, I get this weird error in the Console. Looks like there is a problem with detecting the USB device.  precode20/03/2014 9:05:54.000 pm kernel[0]: USBF:    861.628    The IOUSBFamily is having trouble enumerating a USB device that has been plugged in.

All MacBook Pros come with inbuilt optical out. Using a small adapter I could use that to digitally send the sound (just like USB) to the D1.  <comment146308> Is there a different version of OSX on the two computers? Also, just to eliminate the USB port, try plugging it into the other port if you have one. <comment146310> Both running os x 10.9.2. And yes i have tried both ports with different cables. <comment146313> Since they are on the same version I'd look to make sure there isn't some driver software you installed on the one that's working. It doesn't look like the product page has something, but who knows. <comment146315> The sound card does not need a driver. There isn't even one for it. Apps installed on both machines is almost identical... <comment146316> I'm out of ideas. You might want to try copying and pasting the text from the console which will help people having a similar problem if we can solve it here. <comment146361> Yeah I added the console output to the question. Will keep you updated if I find out anything new. Thanks @dwightk <comment146376> If you have a thunderbolt cable, or a bootable backup of the old macbook. Maybe try booting your new macbook from the old system, or vise-versa to check if it is an issue with the the software, or maybe the usb 3 port? <comment146482> Good idea Kevin. Will try that out.
