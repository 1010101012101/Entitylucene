Ethernet MAC address on Macbook 12" <body> I am trying to locate my ethernet MAC address on a Macbook Retina 12" using codeifconfig/code but I can only see codeen0/code which should be my wireless card; it's quite baffling. Any help would be much appreciated.  <answer238217> MacBook Retina 12" dont have Ethernet port built-in hence en0 is your wifi. Do you use any kind of adapter for ethernet to work? If so, you can use codeSystem Preferences &gt; Network &gt; (choose interface matched with your ethernet adapter) &gt; Advanced... &gt; Hardware/code. From here you can see your MAC Address easily if your ethernet adapter plugged :)  <comment292015> Do you have anything plugged in to your Ethernet port? If you go to your Network preferences under System Preferences  Network, is your Ethernet adapter enabled? <comment292016> Thank you for your response; I was using a USB ethernet adapter through my USB-C to USB/etc adapter so I think that is why I couldn't see it there. I think I need to purchase a direct USB-C to ethernet adapter then. Thanks again! <comment292021> Thank you, it wasn't there; but as I commented to the answer below, I think I know where I went wrong. <comment292054> If your USB ethernet adapter isn't Apple branded then you should try manual install driver for it. As far as I know, you probably can get it to work even with cheap ones from China, they all share some common ethernet chips inside though :) Time to googling a bit...
