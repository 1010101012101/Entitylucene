How to set up Touch Bar to show function keys in a specific VirtualBox virtual machine <body> macOS allows you to change the Touch Bar to traditional function keys when you run specific applications. I have tried to do so with VirtualBox, and it works on the main VirtualBox window properly. The only issue is that when I launch a virtual machine, those settings lose their effect. The reason is that VirtualBox launches a differently-named executable file (from within its app bundle) in order to run the virtual machine in a separate process.   So, the question is: Is there a way to set up macOS to show the function buttons when running a virtual machine in VirtualBox (e.g. Linux or Windows)?  <answer269802> http://www.mastropaolo.com/2016/12/16/how-to-have-function-keys-in-virtualbox-guess-with-macos-touchbar/ The above link provides the answer.  <comment338985> Thanks, great! But according to the rules you need to bring the answer here (links are not sufficient) so that I can mark the answer as correct.
