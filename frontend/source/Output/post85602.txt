Duplicate songs when sync with iPad 1 <body> When I connect my first-gen iPad to my Mac, I have in duplicates in my iTunes. This song have a gray font and have a circle next to their names. Here is a screenshot:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bQHjl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea how to remove this songs? Why do they always show up even after deleting all of my songs off of my iPad?  <answer85612> The songs that you are seeing aren't on your iPad - they are simply still downloading. I believe you can stop them from downloading from the iTunes Store on your iPad or your Mac.  <answer150763> In my opinion, you can use a third-party tool to find and remove the duplicate songs in your iTunes. I once tried with a program called MUSIC CLEANUP. It helped me quickly find and delete all my duplicate songs at once.  <answer153169> I find solution here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3651197?start=15&amp;tstart=0 at leeg330 user answer.  <comment98687> unfortunately i can not do this :/ <comment177420> Do you work for the company that produces Music Cleanup or something? You only have two posts, both on the same subject, and both recommending that software.
