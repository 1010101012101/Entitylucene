A popover shown from the Spotlight menu is stuck on the screen <body> How do I get rid of it? It doesn't show up on task manager. It isn't dead, it responds to the  mouse wheel and scrolls up and down.  Screen shot below...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t3WsU.png" alt="screen shot"  <answer82148> Use Command + Space and the spotlight will go away  <answer120654> The process "QuickLook UI Helper" normally quits automatically after Spotlight is closed, but if it doesn't:  ol liOpen strongActivity Monitor/strong/li liFind strongQuickLook UI Helper/strong/li liQuit it (strongx/strong button in the toolbar)/li /ol  <answer170536> Just kill spotlight., worked for me.  <comment94762> Not really suited for this site, but try `Open Terminal`, `Type "killall SystemUIServer"`. Quite difficult to test as my Spotlight is working, but the Spotlight icon did disappear and reappear <comment94763> Yes, please move to a.s.c - submitted here by mistake. /YR <comment94764> @YiminRong. You can flag for moderator attention and ask them to do it. I've done it for you this time. <comment94765> @JW - that did it, thanks. <comment94768> Nope, didn't work, it brought up another spotlight. It's probably hung, but still responding!
