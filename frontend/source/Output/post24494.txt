Listing all Openmeta Tags and associated Files <body> Some month ago I started using openmeta tags to manage my files. Is there a tool which shows all openmeta tags on my mac and the files tagged with these tags?   <answer24514> Some suggestions:  h2Tags/h2  By strongCASEapps/strong.  ul liLists all created tags and files associated with them/li liCan tag/li liEasy search filtration/li liQuickLook/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/obsqT.png" alt="Tags"  hr  h2Leap/h2  By strongIronic./strong  ul liLists all created tags and files associated with them/li liCan tag/li liEasy search filtration/li liRatings/li liHeavier/more feature rich interface/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyUtz.png" alt="leap"  hr  h2TagLists/h2  By strongAli Rantakari/strong  ul listrongFree/strong/li liTags &amp; Tag searches for file lists must be made manually  ul liie. doesn't list created tags, which was what you were after  ul libut hey, the price is right!/li /ul/li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/06gCn.png" alt="taglists"  <answer51438> Nifty Box was a great free, scriptable application.   I wrote some nice AppleScripts that could go through tags and color certain files.  hr  Links (added by grahamperrin): http://web.archive.org/web/20120623015606/http://www.nifty-box.com/ â€¦ discontinued on or before 2012-06-23.   <comment27518> Thank you. Tags was exactly what I was looking for :-) <comment58808> Can you provide any more information about the program, and perhaps a link? <comment236164> A down vote from be because (unless I'm missing something), Leap does not reliably find files that have OpenMeta tags alone. That surprises me. <comment236166> https://github.com/jdberry/tag/issues/17 is 'Add limited support for OpenMeta'. <comment237536> Additional context: this answer is amongst the examples that are offered in http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/261875/166799 under *How do we encourage edits to obsolete/out of date answers?*.
