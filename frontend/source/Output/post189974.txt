HDMI VGA projector cannot connect to Macbook Pro <body> Why doesn't the projector find the Macbook Pro when connecting a VGA cable to the HDMI port on Macbook Pro via an adapter? It does work on a Windows machine. I know that to fix this problem one needs to connect the VGA to the Mini Display port (via an adapter of course). So is there another way around this? Or do we have to connect to the Mini Display port.   <answer189981> Being that VGA is an analog signal, and (Mini) DP / HDMI are both digital signals, an adapter will be required.   Given that you wanted a solution that used HDMI, a powered HDMI port is necessary, which is not be included with the MBP, in addition Apple does not support such a configuration:          Can the HDMI port drive analog displays (VGA displays, for example) using adapters?     No. The HDMI port will only drive digital connections (such as DVI) using the adapter that came with the Mac. The HDMI port cannot be used for analog displays such as VGA. You can purchase a Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter separately to drive analog displays.      I would think you need to do with the Mini DP converter, if VGA output is necessary. Alternatively, it is possible to get a more expensive powered active converter.  <answer189997> After a few months of experimentation, we found no 3rd party (i.e., non-Apple branded) HDMI &lt; VGA adaptors which worked well and some which emdidn't work at all/em on our Macs. We bit the financial bullet and purchased Apple-branded adaptors and they work perfectly.  We found the same with Thunderbolt &amp; USB &lt; gig-Ethernet adaptors and Lightning &lt; HDMI adaptors, too. Remember, you may save $$ purchasing 3rd-party adaptors, but there are tradeoffs in either operation or quality, frequently both.  Most 3rd party adaptors have little or no strain or twist relief in the cable attachment inside the adaptor. We had slews of non-Apple Thunderbolt &lt; VGA adaptors die after only a week or two of use because the cables literally twisted out of the adaptor body.  <answer230229> I also have an HDMI to VGA adapter and it doesn't work on my Mac, it does on my Raspberry Pi, haven't tried a PC yet.  There is a high probability that its Apple's System Integrity Protection that's stopping 3rd party adapters from working.   This can be disabled, see How to Disable System Integrity Protection (rootless) in Mac OS X.  I was attempting to get a USB to Ethernet adapter working on my MacBook Pro 2015 running El Capitan and it wouldn't work. I disabled this feature and added the driver for the adapter and it worked. See How to use a Generic USB 2.0 10/100M Ethernet Adaptor RD9700 on Mac OS 10.11 El Capitan.  There was a down side though, after this was installed the adapter caused my mac to crash twice. It was causing Kernel panics and wouldn't start hence the name System Integrity Protection.  Since I've restored without it I haven't had problems, it could of been the driver so you could just disable System Integrity Protection and see if it works.  <answer244178> I don't know which product you have, but I own an Insignia HDMI to VGA adapter. There's a micro-USB port on the adapter which I need to plug into a power source, and it then works.  I just plug it into my computer for the power and have a USB hub on the other side for my USB needs.  <answer255308> I can confirm the answer of stronguser3735534/strong works.   Here's what happened in my case. I used to have a Toshiba laptop with VGA port to connect to my VGA monitor. When I upgraded to Mac Book Pro, I gave away the Toshiba but not the VGA monitor.  I purchased an HDMI to VGA adaptor. The brand is strongSandberg/strong. It's a small square plastic box which has the HDMI cable protruding on one end and the VGA slot on the other end. This adaptor also has a small slot on one side for the micro-usb.   After connecting the HDMI and VGA, Mac Book Pro detected a second display (in settings, I could choose to mirror or extend the display). But the VGA monitor stayed black - no display at all. I used the micro-usb port of the adaptor and plugged the USB end to my Mac Book Pro. The VGA monitor then came to life. Now I'm using it as an extended display.  <answer281388> Please use Thunderbolt connector .  <answer294328> I found ICY BOX model IB-AC502 HDMI to VGA connector and works on my MacBook Pro 13 Retina, model 2015. The connector costs about 25EUR.  <comment225450> Hi, yes there is an adapter from the VGA to HDMI, and the windows machine works with this HDMI, but the MBP does not. I know the Mini Display port works but I just thought it was funny that the Win machine would work while the Mac not. <comment277756> can you provide a link to the quote? I'd be interested to see the context.. <comment281023> Unless the HDMI to VGA adapter needs a special driver, I see no reason why disabling SIP would help. <comment308827> @drevicko it's at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204388 (search for "Can the HDMI port drive analog displays"); and here's the [Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB572Z/B/mini-displayport-to-vga-adapter) on Apple's site. <comment317978> Welcome to Ask Different!

Apple says that their HDMI output does not convert to analog like output i.e. VGA. I was facing the same issue but I had HDMI to VGA converter from J5Create. Recently, I found out that it needed a power input for the conversion Now it works like a charm. Hope you find it helpful. Thanks.
