I don't like the update, it doesn't play right, I want to go back to the one I had before.  <answer139892> If you still have the old ipa in your iTunes library, you can install that on your device. Delete the new app from your device, the connect your device to iTunes, select the app and sync.  <comment164823> afaik if you don't have a Backup bevore the update - there is no way to "downgrade" an App
