Cannot paste image in Skype, Line, or Facebook Messenger but pasting works in WeChat and iMessage <body> In iOS 7, we're able to paste an image into iMessage, WeChat, and Whatsapp, but not Line, Skype, or Facebook Messenger. Is this an app-supported setting? Thanks!  <answer135938> Pasting in images into the app requires support from the app's developer to allow this. This isn't as simple as a setting and therefore can't be adjusted externally.  <comment161165> That's what we were afraid of. Thanks.
