Your charging speed seem to be similar to other iPhone 5 data. Charging should take around 3 hours. They have a fast charge function till 80% and they'll start filling up slowly.   However, your battery might be a little lesser than expected of a new iPhone. All lithium-ion batteries lose a little amount of capability of holding the energy. They are called charge cycles and commonly, the Lithium-Ion battery degrades to around 80% when charged 300-500 times.   Your iPhone is perfectly normal :D!!
