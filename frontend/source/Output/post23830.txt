Is there a imac mail app available? <body> Is there a mail app for imac ? Closest thing I can find is thunderbird. Something similar to the iphone mail app ?  <answer23833> There's strongMail.app/strong.  It's built in Mac OS X since at least Tiger, works with POP, IMAP and Exchange.  <comment26615> Thanks, anything for yahoo mail, gmail etc ? <comment26616> I just read the doc, it seems to support yahoo mail & gmail <comment26617> If you want something that looks and feels a little more like the iPhone app, try Sparrow - there is a free version on the Mac App Store, this was originally specifically written for Gmail, but has recently been updated to work with most mail systems.
