Airport Express difference between MC414LL/A and MC414Z/A? <body> I can't seem to find the details on Apple's website, but I have seen both model numbers codeMC414LL/A/code and codeMC414Z/A/code for sale at various web shops.  The english wikipedia only lists the codeLL/A/code variant and the german wikipedia has only the codeZ/A/code model.  Is it perhaps just the difference between US and European models?  <answer195970> It is to do with the difference between the power cable shipped with it and possibly some regional legal restrictions.  The model number is codeMC414/code.  ul licodeMC414Z/A/code is the European variant./li licodeMC414LL/A/code is the US variant./li licodeMC414C/A/code is the Canadian variant./li licodeMC414J/A/code is the Japanese variant./li licodeMC414B/A/code is the UK variant./li /ul  etc...  <comment233920> Pure guess, but it's likely to be which WiFi channels can be enabled. There are different rules in US/EU <comment234075> Thanks, it makes sense. Do you have a source for this? <comment234141> Research and 6.5 years working in an Apple Store
