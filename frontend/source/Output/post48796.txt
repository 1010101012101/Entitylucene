iTerm as a slide-out terminal from the top of the screen <body> I have installed iTerm2 and was hoping I'd have something like guake (Yes I just switched from Ubuntu). I mapped the hotkey to a button of my choice and it works fine, but I miss the slide-down-from-top animation like I had in Ubuntu.  <answer48803> Turn on multiple desktops, have 2, one on top one on bottom.  Assign a hotkey to switch to the TOP desktop. Open iTerm2 and put it in the top desktop and open all other apps on the bottom desktop.  Either make the terminal maximized or full screen (lion) and it should give you something similar to what your're looking for.  <answer48804> If you're not married to iTerm2, you could try TotalTerminal. The slide down window is always a keystroke away.  EDIT - I've loved Total Terminal for a long time.  However, in late 2015 I moved to iTerm2.  It does all the things I loved TT for, but without any of the issues I ran into.    <answer48805> You can use iTerm2's system-wide hotkey with the Hotkey Window profile to do this.  In iTerm2 preferences, click on the "Keys" tab. In the bottom left, under "Hotkey", check "Show/hide iTerm2 with a system-wide hotkey" and assign the hotkey you'd like to use.  Check the "Hotkey toggles a dedicated window with profile:" option and choose "Hotkey Window" in the popup menu below (should be selected by default).  With default settings, the Hotkey Profile window will stretch across the top of the screen, and the hotkey will drop the window down from the top, complete with animation.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gmgPc.jpg" alt="iTerm2 Quake/visor preferences"  You can customize the settings for the "Hotkey Window" profile under the "Profiles" tab. To make it look like a Quake drop-down terminal, you can use similar "Window" preferences:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/l1EPXr5.png" alt="iTerm2 Guake Window preferences"  <answer228480> While iTerm2 suggestion is a good one, it has a few problems of its own.  The hotkey activates all iTerm2 windows.  Before OS X 10.11 El Capitan I used TotalTerminal (Visor) and I loved it.  I had Visor sliding from top down and I used iTerm2 too, depending on task etc.  iTerm2 itself seemed not enough for me when I moved to El Capitan.  But there's a way to closely replicate my old setup.  A tine app called Apptivate can assign global keyboard shortcut to any application, script, etc.  And they can be switched on and off (hidden) with the same shortcuts.  Thus you can easily use Apple's Terminal in a way you used Visor (except for the animation).  So I'm back with my old combo (Terminal.app + iTerm2) and it's close to ideal.  Maybe it will help you too.  <answer275468> The best solution I have found has been dTerm(http://decimus.net/dterm).  <comment55938> thanks mate :) it worked perfectly! <comment88503> this worked great!! but it keeps popping up the default terminal window, so i close that and then i can use the slide down with the hotkey. any way to stop the default terminal window from popping up? <comment117609> Is there a way to disable the animation? <comment126063> @Lane Yes - `defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 HotkeyTermAnimationDuration -float 0.00001` <comment167283> Thanks @joelseph. Is there any way to have iTerms2 to only show the visor/Quake window on startup instead of the 'normal' iTerm2 window? <comment199984> For disabling animation, `0` works just as well. <comment205314> @joelseph, how can we resize height, or toogle fullscreen (as f11 by default on guake) ? <comment205369> @joelseph, I'm also want to know how to show the quake window only. Each time I used the hot key, both the hotkey window and the normal window will show up. It is a little annoying. <comment231501> For me global hotkey works only when iTerm is already running <comment242797> This comment is old as crap so I assume this wasn't the case way back when, but iTerm2 supports a slide down Quake-style console now. <comment250158> In a multi-monitor environment, is there a way to have the screen appear on the window with the mousecursor (similar to TotalTerminal)? <comment252081> TotalTerminal does not work with ElCapitan without tweaking the system's security settings. <comment254513> I'm a refugee from Total Terminal coming here for OSX El Captain. <comment254621> i think iterm2 works, i just had a friend upgrade/downgrade to el capitan and its working fine for him i think. <comment272131> @snowbound To avoid two profiles on startup: -Open iTerm 2. -Close all console windows. -Go to Window  Save Window Arrangement. -Name the new arrangement. I named mine “No Windows”. -Make sure to set it as the default in Preferences  Arrangements. -Last but not least, in Preferences…  General under Startup make sure that “Open default window arrangement” is the only option checked.

I read that comment, but I have to disagree.  My iMac, as is Term2, and it works like it always did.   BUT, are you the developer?  If so, then I'm sure you know more than me.  It still works for me though. <comment329809> I wanted to comment the iTerm thread, but did not have enough points. If you also want to slide over fullscreen apps, [try this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30456472/iterm2-slide-down-over-full-screen-app).
