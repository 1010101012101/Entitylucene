mutagen uninstallable? <body> I cannot understand this:  precodepip install mutagen /code/pre  returns no error, yet as I try to use it I get this:  precode$ python Python 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Jun 22 2011, 22:27:57)  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. &gt;&gt;&gt; import mutagen Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ImportError: No module named mutagen /code/pre  what is happening?  <answer276219> On my Macbook Pro running Sierra, it is not installed.  However if it is, you should be able to remove it with codepip remove mutagen/code, and reinstall it with codepip install mutagen/code. It should automatically download, build and install mutagen.  Also, make sure your python is updated to the latest version (i. e. 2.7.10).  If not, you may want to install Homebrew and upgrade it through that.   Homebrew can be installed by code/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"/code, and python can be updated with codebrew update; brew upgrade/code.
