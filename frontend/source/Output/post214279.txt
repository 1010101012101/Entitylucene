Importing photos without using the OS X Photos app <body> I would like to import my photos off my camera without using the OS X Photos app and locate my photos direct in the Finder so I can store them in folders, edit them in Photoshop etc. (i.e. do whatever I like with my files without getting involved with the Photos app)  This app automatically recognises my camera and offers to import but I can't work out how to import them to a folder or seperate hardrive where I can sort through the files.  Does anyone know how to import to a folder? or even access the individual files in finder if photos has to be used for import?   â€¦or is there a free import software I can use to avoid "photos " completely  (Theres no camera software available for Yosemite from the company that made my camera)  <answer214282> Use Image Capture, in the Applications folder - which is the importer 'behind' Photos.app anyway.  You can set it to auto-launch any capable app, including itself [or do nothing] &amp; set exactly where your imports should be saved. You can also dictate whether it should auto-delete from the camera afterwards, or alternatively you can manually delete any selected pictures.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1xF7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment258809> many thanks, it Worked! so much less frustrating this way. <comment258810> Welcome, glad it helped :) <comment372146> Thank you. I'll never look at Photos again. How can Apple distribute such a bad, the worst app for downloading and editing photos and videos. iPhotos was an Ok and and way much better than Photos. I dp notget what Apple's intentions were. Maybe just to annoy the customers.
