Removed root certificates keep coming back into Keychain <body> A few months ago I was experimenting with a PKI and installed the certificates on my iOS devices. I've since then removed those certs from the devices and reinstalled them multiple times.  Recently I got a Mac and it looks like those certificates somehow came back to it, presumably through iCloud. It doesn't seem there's any way to delete them - I remove them from the keychain but any new Mac that I sign into gets them again (I removed them from my Mac Mini, just got a new Macbook and surprise - those certs are there again).  Does anyone know of a way to permanently delete those certificates?  Regards.
