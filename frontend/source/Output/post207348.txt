Change header date format in Pages <body> How can I change the header date in Pages to just the year? The only choices are different versions on the month, date and year, all together.   <answer208948> The choices that are listed here are based on what is configured within the OS. You can change this, of course.  ol liGo into your strongSystem Preferences/strong under 'Language &amp; Region' and click 'Advancedâ€¦'./li liUnder the 'Dates' tab, you can change one of the formats (e.g., 'Medium') to just be the year and click 'OK'. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uIt4L.png" alt="Custom Date Format"/li liRestart strongPages/strong and you should now be able to customise based on year./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PdSye.png" alt="Date Format"  If you go to a computer that does not have this setting, it will still be the same until somebody edits the date field.  <comment250075> Just manually type it in. <comment250473> Oh for pete's sake! of course! thanks!
