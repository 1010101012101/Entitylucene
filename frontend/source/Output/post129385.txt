After Mavericks upgrade Chrome font is terrible <body> I just upgrade to Mavericks and had some issues. Out of all the issues, one that I get frustrated the most is Chrome browser is not displaying font like it use to be. Here are two images taken from Safari and Chrome to compare.  Chrome:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GvBJg.png" alt="Chrome Browser"  Safari:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mDglO.png" alt="Safari Browser"  As you can see, comparing both Safari and Chrome, fonts on Chrome are more bold.  I use Chrome mostly for my development and the font use in this design is Open Sans font-weight 300.  Is this normal or there is a fix to have Chrome render the fonts more finely as Safari does?  <answer129393> It's not a Mavericks issue.   Google Chrome has (currently) a bad support of Webfonts.   <answer129405> I did some research and found that in Mavericks there was a change in system font.  The font used is Lucia Grande and it was optimized for retina in Mavericks.  If you want to change it back to ML there is a way in Terminal:  precodedefaults write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int 1 /code/pre  That would change it to Lucia Grande "Light" (10.8)  <comment151437> Yes, I did a few search and seems like that is the case. I just don't understand is when I was on Lion, chrome render the fonts just fine. Only after update is when I notice it. I use the same chrome version on both Lion and Mavericks. <comment151546> Give this a try and still font is not rendering correct. In the meantime I just use Safari for viewing and Chrome for developing. <comment151562> @siQuang you will have to restart after changing the font
