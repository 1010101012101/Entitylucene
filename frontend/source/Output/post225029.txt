Does iOS log emergency (911/999/112) calls? <body> Obviously this isn't something I can't test and confirm myself, and I'm unable to find any confirmation either way elsewhere. My question is simple:  After making an emergency call on an iOS device, is the call logged within the phone history?  (I realise emergency calls are nearly always fully logged elsewhere, but I'm only interested at the device level)  <answer225046> Mine does.  (Pardon the image quality... I had to take a picture of one smartphone's call log with another, very old smartphone.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJ5hO.png" alt="enter image description here"
