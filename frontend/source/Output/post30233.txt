Automatically Load LaunchDaemon? <body> I wrote a little script to automatically update my Network Location based on a couple of conditions, and have coupled that with a launchd plist to have it run every couple of minutes.  However, I've noticed that my launchd plist doesn't seem to get loaded when my computer reboots.  My plist is in code~/Library/LaunchDaemons/code and is fairly simple:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.davedelong.location-updater&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/path/to/my/location_updater.rb&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;integer&gt;180&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  My codeLaunchDaemons/code folder has the expected code700/code permissions, and running codelaunchctl load/code with my plist makes things work just fine.  It's just that when I reboot, it's not getting loaded.  I was under the impression that everything in code~/Library/LaunchDaemons/code and code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code got loaded automatically by launchd.  Is this not the case?  If this is the case (and I think it is), then why isn't my plist getting loaded?  <answer30234> code~/Library/LaunchDaemons/code isn't a valid location for either launch agents or launch daemons. You are misunderstanding the terminology. LaunchDaemons are system-wide processes, while LaunchAgents are run per-user. From the launchd man page:  precode~/Library/LaunchAgents         Per-user agents provided by the user. /Library/LaunchAgents          Per-user agents provided by the administrator. /Library/LaunchDaemons         System-wide daemons provided by the administrator. /System/Library/LaunchAgents   Per-user agents provided by Mac OS X. /System/Library/LaunchDaemons  System-wide daemons provided by Mac OS X. /code/pre  Move your plist to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code, and it should just work.   <comment34683> Aha. Documentation to the rescue!
