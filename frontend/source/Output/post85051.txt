Can I deploy Retina with any JAVA version at all? <body> I tried Java 7, then Java 6 (Apple's) but my Java (Swing) desktop applications behave as if I had a MacBook Pro instead of a MacBook Pro Retina.  Is there any setting I need to change somewhere?  Must I wait till ORACLE implements it in Java 7?  <answer85146> Taken A href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2012/Jul/msg00004.html" rel="nofollow"from the instructions for how to modify Eclipse&rsquo;s plist to get retina display. I can verify, this works. Perhaps something similar can be done with your app, assuming that the Mac version has a plist.  OL LIDo "Show package contents" on the Eclipse.app. LIEdit Contents/Info.plist. LIJust above br/ &lt;/dict&gt;br/ &lt;/plist&gt; br/ Place this: br/ &lt;key&gt;NSHighResolutionCapable&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /OL   Following were instructions on how to clear the cached version, but in a development environment while you are creating your apps, they are probably not useful.  <answer104687> The time for waiting is over.  Oracle did implement this at last in jdk-7u40  <comment97979> Can you add more detail?  What do you mean when you say that Java apps behave as if it's a MBP instead of a rMBP? <comment98064> Good find! Links may break though, that's why fully documented answers are preferred on AD. Can you please summarize the solution in your answer? <comment98066> @patrix: edited in response to comment!
