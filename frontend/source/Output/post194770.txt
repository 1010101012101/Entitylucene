Update iOS 5.1.1 on iPad 1 to at least iOS 6 <body> I have read many post about updating an iPad 1 (iOS 5.1.1) to iOS 8 but all I need at the moment is to update my iPad 1 to at least iOS 6. Is there any way I can update it to iOS 6? No jail breaking or anything, just a normal way of updating.   <answer194771> The simple and sad answer is that you can't, not with out doing jail breaking or something like that.  <answer194781> According to this site, the latest version of iOS supported by the original iPad is 5.1.1, so the answer is that within the constraints of the question (no jailbreaking, etc.) you can't upgrade beyond 5.1.1. Sorry.  <answer194844> From Apple's Support:     iOS 6 is not available for the iPhone 3G or earlier, iPod touch (3rd generation) or earlier, and iPad (1st generation).   iOS 7     strongSystem requirements/strongbr   iPhone 4 and laterbr   iPad 2 and laterbr   iPad minibr   iPod touch (5th generation)   iOS 8     strongSystem requirements/strong   iPhone 4s or later   iPad 2 or later   iPad mini or later   iPod touch (5th gen)
