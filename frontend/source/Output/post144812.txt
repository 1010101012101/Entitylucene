My MBP 2011 won't go to slep when AC is plugged in <body> Since a few days, my MBP (15" early 2011 with 10.9.4) won't go to sleep when I close the lid and the AC is plugged in.  I fixed the permissions, repaired the SSD via disk utility, searched in the console to find an issue referenced, try to simulate the closing action with a magnet (the screen goes dark).  Since my computer is not power nap capable, I don't understand what's going on.  It goes well when I unplug it.  <comment170570> @ecnepsnai `try to simulate the closing action with a magnet (the screen goes dark)` the apple goes dark and so th screen ;) <comment170571> But it doesn't when you close the lid, without the magnet?  It stays on? <comment170572> @ecnepsnai when I close the lid, it does dark <comment170573> But when you open it back up, it's right back where you left off?  It doesn't ask you to login, right? <comment170575> @ecnepsnai yes it does ! (I ask it as soon as the screen goes off) but the fans are still working and the console log is still written so it's not sleeping <comment170576> In System Preferences - Energy Saver - Power Adapter Tab is the Computer Sleep set to never? <comment170580> @ecnepsnai yes, but no, that doesn't fix the issue :( <comment170581> In System Preferences - Security & Privacy - General Tab do you have the "Require Password after sleep" to to "immediately"? <comment170582> @ecnepsnai yes !
