Also, that link suggested TinkerTool, but which option in TinkerTool is for disabling the Quick Look animation?  <answer154238> Try the following to re-enable them:  precodedefaults delete -g QLPanelAnimationDuration defaults delete -g NSToolbarFullScreenAnimationDuration /code/pre  Those commands will delete the settings changes that you made, and OS X will reset them to the default settings.
