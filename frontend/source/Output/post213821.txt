MacBook Pro OS X Yosemite having trouble dragging files using trackpad <body> I used to drag files easily from one location to another in Finder on my old MacBook Pro with an older operating system. (using thumb and one finger on trackpad). Now I have to work really hard at it, and usually it opens the window i'm attempting to select, instead of letting me select and move it. After trying 4 or 5 times (and wearing out my arm muscles), I can get it. I'm sure there's a simpler way.    I tried to find preferences for this kind of thing, but under apple preferences, mouse, there is nothing (since I use a trackpad and not a mouse), and under trackpad it doesn't give choices for setting taps for dragging, or anything else related.  Any ideas?  <comment258149> Is it a hardware or software issue, do you think? Might be unrelated to your situation but I notice something similar to what you just described; when my RAM and/or CPU resources etc are stretched thin. <comment258182> There is a three finger drag setting under System Preferences - Trackpad, does that help you? <comment258183> There is also a few other drag-related settings under System Preferences - Accessibility - Mouse & Trackpad (- Trackpad Options).
