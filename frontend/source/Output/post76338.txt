Remove application from App Store's Update section <body> I've got an application in my Updates list which I never installed. It doesn't appear under Purchases nor Hidden Purchases. I can't hide it by right-clicking on it. When I click "Update" it asks me for some different Apple ID I've never heard of.  How can I get rid of the update showing up?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9kfvK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer76346> In Terminal type:  precodecd /Applications /code/pre  then type:  precodegrep -r "EnsenaSoft" /code/pre  This will deep search your applications folder for any sign of that application or it's receipt. It could take a while; if any results show up make a note of the path and then you can trash/delete the app.  Hit Control-C anytime during the grep search to cancel it.  <answer76358> Or download EasyFind -- free from the Mac App Store -- which will quickly and easily find anything anywhere and belongs in every Mac's dock.  <answer93715> I had the exact same problem and this solved it:     All app downloaded from Mac AppStore(MAS) contain a receipt inside   their app bundle (example: appname.app/Contents/_MASReceipt/receipt).   MAS will scan this file to check whether the new version is available.      You can use this application (Find Any File) to search any receipt on   your drive: http://apps.tempel.org/FindAnyFile/      ol   liLaunch 'Find Any File' and search for: _MASReceipt /li   liGo through each result that you think could be the culprit, copy the receipt to your desktop as a backup, and after that delete the   receipt inside   _MASReceipt folder. /li   liOpen MAS and let it scan for software update. If it's still showing the wrong ID, it means that you've deleted the wrong receipt.   Restore the receipt backup from your desktop to it's previous   location. /li   liRepeat the process until you've found the problem receipt./li   /ol   <answer204303> You have the game 'Galaxy on Fire 2' installed. Remove it from all drives, even external drives. Empty trash, reboot, and go back to app store update, the update will then stop showing.  <answer215333> The grep -r "EnsensaSoft" will not work. It should be:  precodecd /Applications /code/pre  and then  precodels -ltr | grep -ir EnsensaSoft /code/pre  <comment88553> Have you checked spotlight to be sure an external disk or a user account doesn't have that Application installed? You might need to run mdfind as root or enable the root user if some of the disk is not searchable by your user account. <comment88554> Yup, there's nothing regarding that application. <comment88555> Also - the questions and answers [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/75671/5472) and [there](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/65708/5472) might be of use in narrowing this down. <comment88559> Sadly none of the tips on these question-pages helped. <comment88564> Hmm - the App Store reads spotlight and your index has found an application bundle matching that app identifier. One of those answers had a step to rebuild your spotlight database. That will let you know if a filesystem contains that app. <comment88571> yeah I rebuild it and it still shows up.
