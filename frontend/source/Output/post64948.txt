How To Record CPU and Memory Usage Data <body> I want to profile the execution of a program to see what in particular is slowing it down - whether it hits a memory cap or if my CPU is not powerful enough.  Activity Monitor (the one that comes with OS X) is great, but I don't think it can record data (i.e. I think you can only see current RAM and CPU usage, not usage from the past).  I want the usage broken down by process if possible, so I can control for other things spiking in usage.  Do you know of any application that has this functionality?   <answer66659> You may want to look into OS Track. It's not the most stable and reliable app but free and I think it should do the things you need. To find our more you can check the screenshots on the developer's site.  <answer267454> To see if CPU or memory is the issue you might start with iostat and vm_stat  You would run these from a Terminal.  To get it to continually record you need to run it as  precodeiostat n /code/pre  where n is the number of seconds between executions.  If you need to look at memory usage then you would want   precodevm_stat n /code/pre  If you want to get information on a particular program then you would probably need to write a script that called something like  precodeps wwaux | grep your_program_name  /code/pre  over and over.  <comment76306> If this is an app you're developing, take a look at Xcode's Instruments tool to profile this kind of thing. <comment76324> No, I'm not developing this app - it's third party. I am trying to figure out if buying more RAM will fix the problem, or if I just have a slow CPU...
