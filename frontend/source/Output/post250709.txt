Delayed type response in a forwarded mail <body> When I attempt to forward an email in Mail 9.3 (3124) on OS X 10.11.5 and start typing anywhere in the window (regardless of the selected text area), it takes ~9 seconds until the text starts to appear.  What is interesting, this problem does not appear if I reply (or reply to all) to the message.  This problem with Mail appeared after the upgrade from OS X 10.9.  Do you know how can I get rid of the delay?
