Homebrew installation failed on OS X El Capitan. Uninstall won't work. How do I start over and reinstall? <body> I'm trying to install Homebrew. Running OS X 10.11.1. When installing, I got an error message. I now can't retrieve the output I got, but there were several "fatal" errors.  When trying to reinstall Homebrew, I get the following:      It appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to   reinstall you should do the following before running this installer   again:       ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"   The current contents of /usr/local are include lib .git   And when I follow those instructions by running the script it recommends, I get:  precode-e:100:in `realpath': No such file or directory - /usr/local/bin (Errno::ENOENT)     from -e:100:in `realpath'     from -e:100:in `&lt;main&gt;' /code/pre  So how in the world do I perform a clean uninstall and reinstall?  <answer253506> Late answer, but I just ran into this issue myself.   This Github issue suggests the solution is to run coderm -rf /usr/local/.git/code. I did that, but the issue persisted. I then deleted the code/usr/local/Homebrew/code directory. That seemed to resolve things for me, and I could then re-run the install command OK.  <comment259706> is there anything in these folders :  `/usr/local/.git` and  `/usr/local/Cellar` ?
