Open same Finder window in different spaces <body> i was asking if someone knows a way to:  ol liopen a desktop folder/li liswitch space/li liopen the same folder without being brought back to the old space/li /ol  Is there a way to do it?  <answer147899> Yes!  Simply right click on the finder icon on the dock, go to "Options" and then select "All Desktops". And voila! You have the same Finder window open anywhere and everywhere you need it!  <comment174358> I can't think of a way to do this. A workaround might be to assign Finder to All Desktops.
