Deleting an update downloaded from App Store that is not installed <body> I now run OS X 10.9.5 on my office laptop, which is monitored by my company. App Store alerted me about Yosemite, and I chose to download and install it. After download completed, I got a notification saying that my company does not support Yosemite and the installation was terminated.  Now Yosemite shows up in App Store as "DOWNLOADED" as shown below, and I get notification asking me to install it every day. How can I remove the downloaded file and/or stop receiving this notification?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPvao.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer175666> You do not have to Install Yosemite.  In your case just open the Applications folder navigate to the "Install OS X Yosemite.app" and Delete it.  <comment207241> talk to your IT department - they control your machine's profile <comment207242> @Tetsujin Thanks for the comment. I actually want to delete the downloaded files locally and don't plan to install it anymore. <comment207245> I can't test, as I have nothing DL'ing right now, but the intermediate location is apparently ~/Library/Application Support/App Store/ Once fully downloaded, they go to Applications  As far as the notification itself, in App Store, I think you're stuck with that - I was, til I bit the bullet. <comment207249> Then the problem becomes there's nothing but updatejournal.plist lying in this folder... <comment207251> The Yosemite file is in your Applications folder, named Install OS X Yosemite.app You can delete it. <comment207253> @Buscarì›ƒ That's the trick! Thank you. <comment207254> @Tetsujin Sorry I didn't fully get "Once fully downloaded, they go to Applications" just now. Problem solved. Thank you. <comment207258> Most welcome... <comment279327> [Does this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/65708/5472) solve your situation?
