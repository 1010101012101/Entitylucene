Keyboard keeps reverting to U.S <body> For a few weeks, I've noticed that my keyboard layout keeps reverting to U.S. each time I reboot. To be precise: each time I reboot, my codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Input Sources/code window looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XFXbv.png" alt="enter image description here"  I keep changing it to this (but it doesn't stick around for long):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rCJKd.png" alt="enter image description here"  NB: MathUnicode is a code.keylayout/code file of my own making, which I've used for several years now, without any problems.  I'm running OS X Yosemite (10.10.1) on a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011).  Does anybody know how I can stop it reverting to the U.S. keyboard layout?  <answer177291> ol liSelect Keyboard you want./li liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. You will need to hold these keys down simultaneously Turn on the computer./li liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys before the gray screen appears. Hold the keys down until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for the second time./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  After resetting NVRAM or PRAM, you may need to reconfigure your settings for speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, and time zone information.  <comment209206> remove it from keyboard preferences! what does it do than ? <comment209670> huh... it doesn't look like any of the keys change between the two screenshots (not that this isn't a problem worth solving, I just noticed that)
