How to share history between terminal tabs? <body> I generally find myself using two or three tabs in my Terminal on OS X.  A minor inconvenience is that, by default, the tabs don't share their command history.  So, searching for a previous command that I ran on another tab by typing codehistory | grep thingIamlooking for/code does not find it.  Is there a way of forcing Terminal tabs to share history, or is there some other "ibhistory_of_all_tabs/b/i" command?   <answer57573> I don't think there is a way to share history amongst Terminal tabs only, but here is something that could help you.  The history is not something that is handled by your terminal but by your shell (bash, tcsh, zsh, etc.)  Here are some options that'll help you set up a shared history amongst all the terminal windows (the shell instances).  This should be put somewhere in your code.bashrc/code file.  precodeexport HISTCONTROL=ignoredups:erasedups  # no duplicate entries export HISTSIZE=100000                   # big big history export HISTFILESIZE=100000               # big big history shopt -s histappend                      # append to history, don't overwrite it  # Save and reload the history after each command finishes export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND" /code/pre  <comment66150> +1. I have the same problem <comment66155> +.5 for good answer, +.5 for good grammar ;) <comment66190> Does it means, i've used a good grammar or you're being ironic ?  English isn't my native language so if there is errors feel free to edit my post or tell me where i'm wrong :) <comment66194> I was referring to your use of `amongst` ;) <comment81176> Apologies for the late accept. :s <comment289147> @Lifely's solution isn't working for me in El Capitan. At all. Even the max length of the history file. Is there a new solution since 2012? (I'd have commented above, but don't have the rep) <comment289260> @JPDuffy i think i changed some stuff in my configuration since El Capitan, because apple changed stuff in how bash calls it's configuration. i'll have a look <comment295105> This is working for me (added in .bash_profile) in El Capitan with the addition of export SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY=0 in my .bash_profile and running: touch ~/.bash_sessions_disable
