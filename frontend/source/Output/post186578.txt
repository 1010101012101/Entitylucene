How to create new folder using contextual menu in MAC OS? <body> I want to create a short cut to create new folder from the right-click/contextual menu in Mac Mavericks. What is the procedure to do so?  <answer186585> When you right click on the desktop or a Finder window the first menu item should be "New Folder", just select that.   <answer186696> I know some people prefer the mouse, but as an alternative for completeness sake...  Of if you prefer SHIFT-COMMAND-N in any window (including right on the desktop) will create a new folder right there.  <comment220316> Isn't my question relevant? Why is it being down-voted? <comment220319> You need to click in a space. Can't be done 'on top' of any existing file/folder.
