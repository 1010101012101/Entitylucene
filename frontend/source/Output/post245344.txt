Why is DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE causing high CPU use? <body> In OSX dlyd is a dynamic linker which can be used to load and link shared libraries when a programe/app is executed.   Using DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES can neatly add a library to any particular app, which is great. However, in order to do that invoking of DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE is required (see dlyd documentation for details).  I case of some apps, this causes CPU to instantly reach 100%. It seems to be independent of the library. As a matter of a fact, running DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE is enough to cause this, on its own:  precodeDYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 "/Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit" /code/pre  Surprisingly, some native OSX apps (Notes, Contacts, etc.) do not seem to suffer from tis problem.  Does anybody have any idea why is this happening? I am using Maverics (10.9.5 - for certain reasons I cannot update) and apart from knowing the reason, would be also interested if this can be replicated in other OSX versions.
