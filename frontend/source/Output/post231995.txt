Where to view app memory usage in iPod Touch? <body> On my iPod Touch I cannot find where to view app static memory usage (not RAM).   Googled articles point to codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage/code. But Usage is not an option within the General section - it is not appearing. I'm using latest version of iOS.  Where should I go to view the installed app static memory usage?   <answer231998> As reported in this webpage: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201656.  You can go to Settings to see how much storage you've used by following: codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Storage &amp; iCloud Usage &gt; Manage Storage/code.  In there you'll see a list of your apps, and how much storage each one uses. Tap an app for more detailed information about its usage.
