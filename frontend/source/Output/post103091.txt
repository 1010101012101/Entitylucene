Man md5 displays dgst man page <body> I just wanted to look at the man page for the command md5. So I typed codeman md5/code but it displayed the man page of codedgst/code instead of this one.  Any idea why and how I could access this manpage from the terminal ?   Edit : codeman -w/code return the path used to look for manpages :  code/opt/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/texbin/man/code  But where does this come from ? Not from my code/private/etc/man.conf/code.   <answer103093> On my ML installation, codeman md5/code does indeed show the codeMD5(1)/code man page.  It's possible some local software installation or configuration is causing the display of a man page for codedgst/code instead, though (which appears to be part of OpenSSL.)  A few things to check:  Do you have the codeMANPATH/code environment variable set in your shell?  It could be looking in an alternative directory for manpages before hitting the system manpages.  codeMANPATH/code does not appear to be set by default.  Are there alternative codeMANPATH/code directives in code/private/etc/man.conf/code?  My system has  precodeMANPATH /usr/share/man MANPATH /usr/local/share/man MANPATH /usr/X11/man /code/pre  Has code/usr/share/man/man1/md5.1/code been replaced by a symlink to another man page that could be producing the codedgst/code content?  Try  precode$ ls -l /usr/share/man/man1/md5.1 -r--r--r--  1 root  wheel  12332 Nov 16  2012 /usr/share/man/man1/man.1 /code/pre  If code/usr/share/man/man1/md5.1/code has not been changed, then you can read its content specifically this way:  precode$ man /usr/share/man/man1/md5.1 /code/pre  <answer103175> I'll answer myself to my question after a bit a research :   To see how the manpath is build, looking at codemanpath -d/code is quite interesting.   codeman/code uses codeMANPATH/code/codeMANPATH_MAP/code (as defined in code/private/etc/man.conf) and/code$PATH` from the environment variables to build it's search path.   Because of MacPort my code$PATH/code starts with the multiple subdirectories in code/opt/local//code.  Therefore my manpath will start with code/opt/local//code manpages.   <comment121441> I have no MANPATH in my environment variables, MANPATH are the same than yours and  `man /usr/share/man/man1/md5.1` shows the right man page. I still don't get why I dgst's manpage. <comment121466> Interesting. I had seen `MANPATH_MAP` referenced, but didn't bring it up because it wasn't clear to me from `man`'s own manpage how it worked. This is enlightening, thank you!
