You can run a full test on the RAM with something like codeMemtest/code booted off a CD. See here for Mac instructions.  You may find just one RAM module is corrupt and you just need to replace or remove it. It might also be that the RAM has become unseated, try taking it out and putting it back in again to see if that is the case.  <answer137277> Looks like I am not alone -  http://breakfree.cc/  After going thought this article I finally know what the problem was -  Early-2011 MacBook Pro owners report hardware failures &amp; system crashes http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-reported-3497935/  http://www.change.org/en-AU/petitions/timothy-d-cook-replace-or-fix-all-early-2011-macbook-pro-with-graphics-failure  <comment305286> 3 beeps always indicate memory issues. Good one SJT.
