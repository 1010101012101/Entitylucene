Mac mini, two monitors over hdmi and Thunderbolt simultaneously <body> Will the new Mac Mini (mid-level, quad-core) support the following twobr monitors simultaneously: one an Apple Cinema Display 30", 2560x1600br resolution, connected to both the Thunderbolt port and one USB port via thebr Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adaptor (this thing:br http://store.apple.com/ca/product/MB571Z/A/mini-displayport-to-dual-link-dvibr -adapter)br  and the other monitor a Samsung with 1600 x 1200 resolution connected tobr the Mini Mac by the hdmi port, using the hdmi-to-dvi adaptor Apple gives youbr with the Mac Mini?                                                                I have read in some places that hdmi cannot output better than 1920 x 1080,br but 1600 x 1200 is actually fewer pixels and I have read differing accountsbr of whether it will work.                                                          For the Apple Cinema Display, currently on my MacBook Pro 2009 I run itbr using the adaptor I mentioned above, and it needs to connect to one USB portbr as well as to the miniDisplay Port. I am guessing that the Thunderbolt portbr will serve instead of the miniDisplay Port and I will still need to connectbr to one USB port on the Mini, in addition to the Thunderbolt port.                 Thank you!  <answer70827> Yes, that will work.  The maximum for HDMI 1.0 is actually 1920x1200, not 1080. Later revisions can go higher, but previous Mac mini HDMI ports have been limited to 1920x1200 and there's no reason to believe it would have changed.  <comment82266> Thank you! And do you know if the 30" cinema display will still need an extra USB port on the new Mac Mini, like it does on the MacBook Pro, or will the Thunderbolt port be enough? <comment82268> It'll still need it. Thunderbolt ports can output Mini-Displayport, and they might be able to supply enough power for the adapter, but the adapter won't be designed to take advantage of that.
