iPad volume issues <body> I seem to be having a strange problem with my iPad. The volume only sometimes works. The volume will be fully turned up and not muted, but it won't work. Then, without changing anything, a couple minutes later it will work. Or, I will try to FaceTime someone and I will not hear it ring on my end. Then when they answer, I can't hear them and they can't hear me. I'll try again a second after and it'll work again. It is never consistent though. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I have tried everything setting wise. Nothing fixes my problem. Help?  <comment372878> Is this just with the speakers? <comment372902> did you check your headphone plug for contamination, something might be stuck in there
