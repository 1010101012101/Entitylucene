Mountain Lion 10.8.5 VPN can not connect to internal http sites <body> I VPN into my companies network.  Yesterday all was well. Today when I try to go to an internal website it will not go there.  I am using Chrome on Mountain Lion 10.8.5.  ssh, telnet, nfs all still work fine.  My support tried to help but no luck.  One of them said this is a frequent occurrence with the native VPN client.  Does any one know how to fix this?  <comment121813> Do you have any error messages ? <comment121954> The error is 404 not found?  What is odd is I later tried Safari and it works.  So then I loaded Firefox and it works. Chrome still does not and I have already cleared the cache. <comment121963> So the support was right, it has a hick up sometimes. You could look up win the Console to see if there is a problem reported there. <comment122168> To me this does not make sense.  Chrome still does not go to the internal site and displays the Oops! Google Chrome.... screen.  Safari and Firefox go to the internal site no problem.  It seems to me like a setting in Chrome is causing the issue. <comment122176> Agree, so check you Chrome settings and compare to Safari and FF. <comment123077> The question is which settings?  The obvious ones do not seem to be the issue.
