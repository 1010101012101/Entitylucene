Dictation settings with AppleScript <body> I'm trying to create an an AppleScript to turn dictation on or off (not just make it start listening). My goal is to be able to disable dictation when I am on battery power.  I am new to AppleScript and don't know how to do this. I need this to work on macOS Sierra.  <answer267564> I found my answer!  Here is my code if somebody wants it:  precodeset quitting to 0 delay 1 repeat until quitting is 1     set PowerSource to (do shell script "pmset -g ps")     repeat until PowerSource does not contain "AC Power" or quitting is 1         set PowerSource to (do shell script "pmset -g ps")     end repeat     --START     tell application "System Events"         set ProcessList to name of every process         if "System Prefrences" is in ProcessList then             set ThePID to unix id of process "System Prefrences"             do shell script "kill -KILL " &amp; ThePID         end if     end tell      tell application "System Preferences"         activate         set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.keyboard"     end tell     tell application "System Events"         --Part 1:         tell process "System Preferences"             --Part 2:             delay 1             --Part 3:             tell application "System Events" to tell radio button "Dictation" of tab group 1 of window "Keyboard" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events" to if exists then click             tell application "System Events" to tell radio button "Off" of radio group 1 of tab group 1 of window "Keyboard" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events" to if exists then click         end tell     end tell     tell application "System Preferences" to quit     display notification "Hey siri is now off."     --END     repeat until PowerSource contains "AC Power" or quitting is 1         set PowerSource to (do shell script "pmset -g ps")     end repeat     --START     tell application "System Events"         set ProcessList to name of every process         if "System Prefrences" is in ProcessList then             set ThePID to unix id of process "System Prefrences"             do shell script "kill -KILL " &amp; ThePID         end if     end tell      tell application "System Preferences"         activate         set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.keyboard"     end tell     tell application "System Events"         --Part 1:         tell process "System Preferences"             --Part 2:             delay 1             --Part 3:             tell application "System Events" to tell radio button "Dictation" of tab group 1 of window "Keyboard" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events" to if exists then click             tell application "System Events" to tell radio button "On" of radio group 1 of tab group 1 of window "Keyboard" of application process "System Preferences" of application "System Events" to if exists then click         end tell     end tell     tell application "System Preferences" to quit     display notification "Hey siri is now on."     --END end repeat on quit     set quitting to 1     continue quit end quit /code/pre  Just open it in script editor and compile it into an application. Then launch the application. Hope this helps!
