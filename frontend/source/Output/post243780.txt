Restart download Mac OS X (macOS) Sierra, Developer Preview version <body> My download of macOS Sierra (Developer Preview, see press release) began downloading, appearing in the Launchpad app. But then got interrupted. It failed to restart, so I deleted the icon in Launchpad by holding down Option key and clicking the "X" icon that appears.  Now when I try the download again, the link on the Developer page takes me to the App Store app. There I get page with a codeRedeem/code button and an error message saying “This code has already been redeemed.”.   How can I restart the download?  <answer243781> If you have already successfully redeemed your code:  ul liGo to the strongPurchased/strong Tab of the Mac App Store./li liClick the strongDownload/strong button on the strong10.12 Developer Preview/strong listing./li /ul  It is the same process as re-downloading anything from the Mac App Store.
