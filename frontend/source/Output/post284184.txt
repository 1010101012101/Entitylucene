Fullscreen on multiple displays and swiping moves all screens <body> This worked up until May 16th. Before and after updating to macOS Sierra 10.12.5 did not solve problem.  h2Config / Specs:/h2  ul liMacBook Pro/li liDell monitor/li liiPad using Duet app/li /ul  h2Previous functionality/h2  I could expand fullscreen any app/program in Mac (the green button top right) and use 3 fingers on the trackpad to toggle between 'screens' on that individual physical screen.  h2Current bug/h2  When I fullscreen an app on one display and swipe with three fingers, swiping controls all 3 physical displays. The display in question swipes to the app, but the other two displays also swipe to the right showing blank black or white backgrounds and are mouseover-able.  h2Desired functionality -- the Previous Functionality/h2  Swiping on a screen only controls that display.  <answer284185> System Preferences â†’ Mission Control and enable Displays have separate Spaces.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l0bdG.png" alt=""
