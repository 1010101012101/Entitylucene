Simulate shift-tab with Automator/AppleScript? <body> OSX 10.9.1, Late 2013 MBPr  I am trying to make a Automator workflow to connect to another machine on my network. How can I do this with Automator? I have it all set up up to the point where I have to enter and admin's name and password, but I can't find a way to simulate keystrokes that bactually works/b. I found a method that sounded legitimate here, but this did not work for shift-tab (as the field selected on launch is the password, and I need to edit the username band/b password).  I tried this AppleScript, which is what that post told me to do:  precodeon run {input, parameters}  tell application "System Events"     keystroke (tab) using {shift down} end tell  return input end run /code/pre  The Automator workflow claims to have finished with no error, but the field selected on launch is still selected. How can I successfully select this field? Thanks!  <answer122050> If you want to automate Screen Sharing then the easiest way is to save a connection file.  Connect to the computer whose screen you want, making sure to save the password. Now go to the "File" menu and save the connection. You will get a file that can be easily opened from the command line or in Automator, or even just double clicked in the Finder. I do it most nights.  <comment142342> Could we back up just a fraction. Why are you attempting to connect to the machine - file sharing, screen sharing? It may be easier to do the entire connection from the command line. <comment142350> @TonyWilliams Screen Sharing, with a 10.9.1 Late 2013 iMac. <comment142387> Yes, I did that, and automated opening that file, and once I open the file (with Automator or with Finder), a window appears for me to enter a username and password.  I need to select the first field to type into (or, rather, Automate typing into).
