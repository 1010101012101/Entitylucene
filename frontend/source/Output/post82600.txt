Can you send a message across the network? <body> There used to be the ability, perhaps before OS X, to send messages accross the local network, which displayed a popup on the receivers machine with the message. Is this still possible? Or is there another way to send a message to another member of the network?  If this isn't possible, could a text file be sent, with a message, to a recipients Public folder?  Preferably with the terminal.  (I realise there are lots of aps which do messaging, but I was curious if this was possible without installing software or setting up iChat etc)  <answer82606> According to this metafilter post you can send a message using Applescript (pre-installed on every Mac) and Growl (old version is freely available). The relevant part is quoted hereunder.  precodetell application "GrowlHelperApp" of machine "eppc://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" register as application "myapp" all notifications {"message"} default notifications {"message"} notify with name "message" title "title"   description "description" application name "myapp" end tell      /code/pre  Here xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx should be substituted by the IP address of the sender.  <comment95292> Just to be sure, you want to send a message from a Mac to another Mac? Or is there a Windows computer involved? Could you also add which OS versions your machines are using? <comment95300> mac to mac. what kind of animal uses windows? not a wildebeest anyway <comment95334> That's interesting, but its a third-party program. Is there something which would work with a base OS X install?
