How to restore to Leopard/Snow Leopard from Lion without any disk? <body> My friend has a Mid 2010 Macbook pro with Mac OS X Lion installed on it. She wants to restore it (as in format/erase and get a fresh start). However she does not have any disks.   When trying to restore using the CMD+R option during the boot process she is asked to sign in with her account but then a message saying she does not have OS X Lion purchased under her account prevents her from continuing with the installation. Is there a way to buy this online so she can proceed?  Also, she has the Recovery Partition in her HD so going back to Leopard/Snow Leopard is also an option. Is it possible? How?  Any hints on how to proceed without having to get an actual physical media is appreciated.  Thanks  <answer137393> Once you have upgraded your Macintosh's operating system there is no going back without already owning an official CD or a backup of the operating system available.  You are going to have to buy a complete new CD from the shops as said above are quite cheap so you may want to consider checking your local store.  Also I am running on a Late-2009 iMac so your friend running a 2010 model MacBook Pro should be able to upgrade to OS X 10.9 Mavericks for free from the App Store which is even better than Lion.  <comment163087> The important question is whether or not her MacBook Pro came with Lion from Apple. It is totally unsupported to downgrade the OS past what the computer came with. You might still be able to do it with some hacks. <comment163088> There is no recovery partition for Snow Leopard.  If there is a recovery partition on the HD, then booting into it should allow you to reinstall Lion. <comment163089> You can buy it at Apple Store for $20. http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC573Z/A/mac-os-x-106-snow-leopard
