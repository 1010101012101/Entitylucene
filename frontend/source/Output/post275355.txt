How can I find an iOS app I had installed once but since deleted? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DMTtl.png" alt="enter image description here"  i had this app on my old phone and when i got a new phone i could never find the name of it. I thought it was called "InstaFollowers" but i guess not. This app specifically has a calender where everyday for 30 days is something different and you get to spin a wheel and everything! If anyone knows what app this is let me know!  <answer275356> If your old phone and new phone are both iPhones, then all you need to do is check the purchase history under your Apple ID to re-download it.  To do this:  ul liLaunch the App Store app on your iPhone/li liTap on Updates/li liTap on Purchased/li /ul  You will now be able to access your purchase history and, should even be able to filter by the emNot on This iPhone/em tab.  If you can't find the app in your history, then it's possible that it's no longer available on the App Store. If that's the case, you may be able to re-install it from iTunes on your computer, especially if you have Time Machine backups (assuming you're on a Mac).  <comment346379> Omg thank you so much i found it that way!
