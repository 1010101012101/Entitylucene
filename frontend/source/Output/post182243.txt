Aperture library on self-created FusionDrive: References are lost <body> I know it's a bit late to ask Aperture questions, but anyway...  I run Aperture on an iMac with a self-created FusionDrive. The FusionDrive's volume is called FusionDrive, and it consists of an SSD called SystemSSD and a large HD called BigDisk. In almost all Mac programs, only the volume FusionDrive is visible (i.e. it appears at the root of the file system) -- as it should be.  Aperture, however, also shows me SystemSSD as a distinct volume. All images in my collection are referenced images, and Aperture constantly tries to find them on SystemSSD, meaning I constantly have to manually reconnect missing referenced images (they're on the FusionDrive, I just have to point the browser to use FusionDrive instead of SystemSSD as the root of the file system).   Is this a known problem, and are there any workarounds?
