Batch renaming section of file names in OSX 10.8.5 and sorting them instantly <body> Is it possible to batch rename thousands of movie file names in Mac OSX 10.8.5 by targeting a section of the current name and renaming that section only on the fly as it renames the files? The idea is, Automator recognizes the renaming process as an instruction to move the renamed files upon being renamed. These renamed files to be moved into their respective folder as the script is executed while still renaming the remaining files without any additional input to move them as the script moves on.  I am looking for a cascading effect such as this:  1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9 should become the new file name, replacing Done_filename into 1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_filename. (Part 1 of the script being Done_ becoming the number list separating the 9 from the filename with an _)  However, (upon selection of the E.G. 'Documentary' Automator Script to be written), 1 in this lineup would need to be replaced by this example model: Documentary_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_Filename. So the selection of a list of files (most likely in the same folder) should then instantly be renamed accordingly whilst being moved from their residence folder into the 'Documentary' folder those files are assigned to upon execution of their script.  The other selection would then for example be: 2 to become 'War' to replace all those that match that content type. Thus resulting in: Documentary_War_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_Done_Filename after a second conversion.  'War' thus ending up after renaming in its Documentary  War folder, if you get my point.  Or even better: One script targeting 1 and 2 simultaneously and rewriting their file names as Documentary_War_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_Filename while moving them to their 'War' folder instantly without the first conversion itself.  The ultimate script should allow me for generating the exact view setting properties of the new folders to be created as the Automator script recognizes the target number name as an additional instruction to create that folder when it doesn't exist yet in the parent directory. After checking such an 'incubated' folder of the script, I should then see the sorting properties file name, label and comments. Now I have to define those properties again and again for every new folder I have to create.  Obviously I will go on and on thereafter by renaming filenames again and again to result in for example a movie of accelerating tanks in a Russian conflict to end up in their appropriate folder. All tank combat movies can then be found in Documentary  War  Attack  Tank  Shot for example. I'm still running the options through my head. Later on, I should be able to go even deeper by defining the exact second that tank is shooting. But that will be my next question... ;)
