Is there in AppleScript any way to use "X of every" to get multiple properties of each object to create a record? <body> It is possible to with the script:  precodetell application "Safari"     set urls to URL of every tab of every window end tell /code/pre  when execute, get all urls of every tab of every window (two dimensional list)  precodeResult:  {{"http://domain1", "http://domain2", ...}, {"http://domain3", "http://domain4", ...}, {...}} /code/pre  But is it possible with:  precodetell application "Safari"     set (urls &amp; name) to URL of every tab of every window end tell /code/pre  to get a record instead of list:  precodeResult:  {{{url: "http://domain1", name: "domain1 - foo"}, {url: "http://domain2", name: "domain2 - bar2"}, {...}}, {{url: "http://domain3", name: "domain3 - foo3"}, {url: "http://domain4", name: "domain4 - bar4"}, {...}}} /code/pre  Is it possible, or should I use only coderepeat/code?  <answer106728> It is not possible to get a record with a single object specifier, but you can get a list:  precodetell application "Safari"     {URL, name} of tabs of windows end tell -- {{{"http://url1", "title 1"}, {"http://url2", "title 2"}}} /code/pre  For a record, you can use a repeat loop:  precodeset r to {} tell application "Safari"     repeat with t in tabs of windows         set end of r to {|url|:URL of t, |name|:name of t}     end repeat end tell r -- {{|url|:"http://url1", |name|:"title 1"}, {|url|:"http://url2", |name|:"title 2"}} /code/pre  <comment125308> great! is it possible get all this with `{|safari|: {{|window_1|: {|url|: "http://url1", |name|: "title 1"}, {|url|:"http://url2", |name|:"title 2"}},{|window_2|: {|url|: "http://url3", |name|: "title 3"}, {|url|:"http://url4", |name|:"title 4"}}}}` ? So that I could convert the record to json (e.g. with `JSON Helper`) and still have a safari windows structure? I wrote a script for that all to get a string-based (not record-/list-based, what I would like to have), and it is about 200 lines of code with 3 subroutines and it looks ugly even for myself <comment125316> If I test so: `{|safari|: {|window1|: {{|url1|: "http1", |name1|: "title1"},{|url2|: "http2", |name2|: "title2"},{|url3|: "http3", |name3|: "title3"}}}} & {|safari|: {|window2|: {{|url1|: "http1", |name1|: "title1"},{|url2|: "http2", |name2|: "title2"},{|url3|: "http3", |name3|: "title3"}}}}` it returns only: `{safari:{window1:{{url1:"http1", name1:"title1"}, {url2:"http2", name2:"title2"}, {url3:"http3", name3:"title3"}}}}` and not the merged variant, where there is a list of `windows` <comment125319> The double curly brackets (e.g. list): `{|safari|: --{{-- |window1|: ...` doesn't make any change <comment125323> sorry for so many off-topic comments, but I almost solved this to myself: how to set the the key of the record in the runtime? so `set end of w_l to {|window & "_" & window_i :t_l}` ?
