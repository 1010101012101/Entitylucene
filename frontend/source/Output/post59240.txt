Can grep highlight matching text without hiding file content? <body> I frequently use codegrep/code's context command line options (code-A/code, code-B/code, and code-C/code), but occasionally I want to view the whole file with matching expressions highlighted. To accomplish this currently I simply specify code-C 999999999/code, but this seems silly.  Is there an option within OS X's bundled codegrep/code that will allow me to easily take advantage of grep's matching and colorizing features, without hiding any file content?  <answer59254> I don't think there is any simple option in grep but this seems to work fine. From https://stackoverflow.com/a/981831  precodegrep --color -E "pattern|$" file /code/pre  The code|$/code at the end of the regular expression makes grep find pattern OR end of lines. It can't highlight those though, so just the pattern gets colored.  <answer59303> Setting code-C/code to a negative integer seems to be equivalent to setting it an arbitrarily large number.  precodegrep something --color -C -1 *.txt /code/pre  But as with something like code-C 9999999/code, if the file has multiple matches, some lines can be printed multiple times.  <answer67087> Assuming you want to read the file yourself, with the bits highlighted, less is the better tool for the job.  codeless yourfile/code, type code//code, your pattern and hit return.  coden/code goes to the next match and codespace/code to the next page.  Alternatively, ack has a code--passthru/code mode that does what you want.  ack is so insanely useful it's worth looking into.  <comment68260> I say "OS X's bundled `grep`" explicitly because I know that this is BSD `grep`, and I would rather not install GNU's whole coreutils, assuming GNU `grep` has this built in. <comment68272> I don't think the bundled grep is capable of this. OTOH you could `alias grep='/usr/bin/grep -C 999999999'` in interactive shells and forget about it. <comment68273> This is not intended to be a permanent change :). (Translation: `alias grepall='/usr/bin/grep -C 999999999'`) <comment87480> I love this answer, and may switch to ack eventually. But in the interim, grep is so insanely ingrained in my brain that it's a hard switch to make. But thank you for this wonderful alternative. <comment285360> Also; `-E "pattern.*|$"` will highlight until the end of the line. <comment285361> For example: `ls /bin/ /usr/bin/ |sort |grep --colour -nE '/.*|$'`
