Safe key combinations for global shortcuts <body> Is there any combination of modifier keys that could be considered 'safe' for setting global shortcuts with a third-party app? For example, I do window snapping with kbdcmd/kbdkbdopt/kbdkbdJ|L/kbd, but kbdcmd/kbdkbdopt/kbdkbdI/kbd would conflict with Chrome's dev tools shortcut.   I'd like a set of modifiers I can use for virtually any global shortcut I want without conflict.  <answer224357> For personal macros, I usually simply use the control key—practically nothing uses just the control key as a modifier; it's always paired with command. (e.g. kbd⌃/kbdkbdJ/L/kbd)  If you're asking so you can include it in software you're developing to widely distribute, though, I wouldn't recommend this for exactly the reason that it's a good idea for personal use: it's pretty non-standard.  <comment272091> I use 3 & 4 key modifiers to stay out of the way of other apps.
