Fast user switching: how to prevent volumes from being unmounted? <body> I have a volume mounted. If I switch to another user, this volume gets dismounted. The problem is that I want this volume to be available for every user (but putting it in their login items is not the solution I'm looking for), so: how can this behavior be prevented? (I'm on Mountain Lion)  <answer59112> You can stop Mac OS X unmounting user disks on log-out. This behaviour is controlled with a default (preference).  In this discussion on the Apple Support Community, Kir√°ly shares the appropriate command to issue:  precodedefaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/autodiskmount AutomountDisksWithoutUserLogin -bool YES /code/pre  This command needs to be entered into Applications  Utilities  Terminal.app. Aftwards you must strongrestart your Mac/strong for the change to take effect.  Note that the codeautodiskmount/code tool has been replaced by codeautomountd/code; it is possible Mac OS X 10.8 has migrated this default to another file.
