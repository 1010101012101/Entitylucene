How to ignore modification dates in a Mercurial repository when backing up with Time Machine <body> I have several Mercurial repositories, and as many may know, when updating to a certain branch (or merging), the repository also "updates" the modification dates to the current date and time.  Since Time Machine checks the modification dates and compares it to the previous backups, an "updated" Mercurial repository will be considered different compared to the previous backup and Time Machine will back up everything again (even if only one file has been changed in a set of thousands).  My question is how to deal with this (ignore the modification dates) when backing up with Time Machine?  Is there a way to make Time Machine understand what has been changed?  NOTE: I'm using OS X 10.9.5  <comment254902> How large is the repository? If it's not too big (and you're not too busy), you can make prevent TM from backing up specific folders and then just back it up yourself when significant changes have been made. <comment254924> @Arc676 I have many, and some are hundreds of MBs, also that (manual backuo) defies the purpose of Time Machine, I'm not very hopefull but someone may have some idea to solve this issue.
