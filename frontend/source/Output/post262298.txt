XQuartz problem on OS 10.12.1 <body> I In stalled Xquartz from here, but when trying to start it from the command line via  precode/opt/X11/bin/Xquartz /code/pre  I get an error:  precode&gt; /opt/X11/bin/Xquartz dyld: Symbol not found: __cg_png_create_info_struct   Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO     Expected in: /opt/X11/lib//libPng.dylib  in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO   Abort /code/pre  Perhaps I'm missing some libraries? Or some of the environment variables is not properly set?  Any help most appreciated.  strongedit/strong  So, I did some research and found out that XQuartz installs its own codelibpng.dylib/code in code/usr/X11/lib//code, which hence superseeds the system installation in code/System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libPng.dylib/code. So after   precodesudo ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/Resources/libPng.dylib /usr/X11/lib /code/pre  the above error disappears only to be replaced with the next:  precodedyld: Symbol not found: _gll_noop   Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/OpenGL   Expected in: /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/OpenGL  in /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/OpenGL /code/pre  (which hangs). This behaviour persists also if I codeunsetenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH/code (found recommended on some sites). I cannot find a library implementing code_gll_noop/code ...
