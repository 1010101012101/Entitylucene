removing previous owner's account from iPad <body> A friend got an iPad which she had been given as a gift by an acquaintance of hers, which happened to be erased to reset everything about it. Unfortunately, the device remained signed into the previous owner's iCloud account whose ID and password are known neither to her nor to myself. Whenever I try to register it to my Apple ID, I'm requested to sign in using the credentials of the previous owner. I don't know how to go about it. please assist me. thanks
