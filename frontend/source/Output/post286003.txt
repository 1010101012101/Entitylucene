Is there a Notification Center icon cache? Trying to change Apple app icons but they change to default app icon <body> I have tried unsuccessfully to change the Apple system app icons (Mail, Messages, Reminders, etc) in LiteIcon on macOS Sierra 10.12. After applying the new icon, the Dock icon and the main icon seems to change, but the icon shown in Notifications does not (see images below).  When I finish changing the icon in Liteicon, I select the menu item: 'Clear Icon Cache and Log Out.' Also, I have tried these commands in Terminal:  precodesudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -exec rm {} \; sudo find /private/var/folders/ -name com.apple.iconservices -exec rm -rf {} \; sudo mv /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store com.apple.ic /code/pre  â€¦and I have tried copying image content into 'Get Info' and I have tried replacing the app icon in 'APP.app'/Contents/Resources. Neither of these have worked.  Any suggestions for clearing Notification Center icon cache, or what I may do so notifications display the correct icon?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSmSr.jpg" alt="notifications show like this"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ru0Ol.jpg" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NDlg.jpg" alt=""  <answer286598> I found an answer to my issue using this AskDifferent post: Apps Icons not appearing.  I think what finally solved the issue was:  ul lideleting strong~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/strong and then/li liEnter this command codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li liRestart Mac/li /ul  I hope this helps anyone who is having this or a similar issue. Thanks!
