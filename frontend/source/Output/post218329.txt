Changing the owner of a directory when username has a . (dot) in it <body> If I enter codewhoami/code in Terminal.app my id is shown as Abhi.Sri  Now if I do  codechown -R Abhi.Sri /usr/local/code it says the user Abhi.Sri is invalid.   <answer218331> The terminal might be interpreting the dot ('.') as a wildcard character.  I'm not at my Mac, so I can't test this, but try escaping the '.' with a backslash:  codechown -R Abhi\.Sri /usr/local/code  <answer218335> I think your short username is malformed. I recommend to rename it to lower case characters (and no special characters except the underscore).  Additionally you would have to use a emsudoers/em account (e.g. an admin account) and prepend codesudo/code to change ownership of /usr/local since /usr/local is owned by root:wheel. Changing the ownership of /usr/local strongand/strong subsequent items is non-standard and not recommended.  <comment263934> Please copy/paste the full output of both `whoami` and `chown`, details may matter here. <comment263936> As I've just verified, usernames with `.` are not a problem for `chown`, so the problem is definitively something else. But we need some more details about your setup to find out where the issue is. <comment263937> OS X happily lets you create usernames with dots and in mixed caps, so this is not the issue here. <comment264442> Can someone explain why this may have been voted down? Obviously I'm new here, and I'd like to know what makes a good answer. I've taken the "get started" tour and checked the help system specifically for what makes a "good" answer.
