What does this error message in iMovie mean? <body> I provided a screenshot below for what seems to be corrupted files (I'm referring to the black icons with question marks in them). It seems that I can't reimport those missing files from the memory card either.   The strange thing is that when I stick my memory card into my computer the these error icons are replaced by real icons and I can in fact play the videos. But again when I take the card out it breaks. And I cannot reimport.   Any input into this matter would be greatly appreciated.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XtvP.png" alt="black icons with question marks"  <comment293783> Looks like either iMovie can't generate a thumbnail for videos or they moved and it was unable to relocate them. <comment293892> I haven't move a video file. And when hold the pointer over the small video camera symbol in the squares it says something like "The media is still on the camera". That's no useful info for me. Also, I don't seem to be able to reimport these files to iMovie. <comment293893> Also forget mentioning important info (I will edit the question), when I stick the memory card in the computer those error icons will be fixed and the video file can be played, but when I take out the memory card, the files goes dead like this. And as said before, I wouldn't know how to reimport them again. <comment293896> Sounds like the movies are on your memory card! When you remove the memory card, iMovie can't find your videos, as they are disconnected when your memory card is. Try dragging the videos from your memory card onto your desktop and reimporting them, or just leaving that memory card in.
