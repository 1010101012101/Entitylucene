Can't switch Firefox windows using command+tilde <body> I prefer using multiple Firefox windows. Until now I could easily switch between its different windows by using the kbdcommand/kbd + kbd~/kbd shortcut. But all of a sudden I can't do that anymore.  I can still use the shortcut for other apps but not for Firefox. Both the windows are in the same space and I don't recall making any changes.   strongAny hints on what's happened or how I can rectify this?/strong  <answer290692> FWIW, I fixed the problem the following way.  I noticed that the kbd⌘/kbd+kbd~/kbd stops at a specific window, while works on other Firefox windows.  I closed that window, then re-opened it via History menu. The effect was gone, and kbd⌘/kbd+kbd~/kbd started working as expected.  <comment362906> Are all the windows in the same Space? It only works if they are. <comment366944> I see the same problem, which hit suddenly after a Firefox restart (no version update). Strangely, _some_ Firefox windows switch normally, while others react on `cmd`+`~` by going back in tab's history.
