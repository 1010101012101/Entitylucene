Notifications stuck after Time Machine restore <body> After restoring my entire system from a Time Machine backup, there are two notifications stuck in notification centre. The "X" to remove them is missing and they return even after disabling and reenabling notifications for the two apps which they are from (Reminders and Calendar). Here's a screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hnufi.png" alt="Stuck notification centre"  Newer notifications will still appear and can be removed. I am running OS X 10.11  <comment259168> Have you tried reinstalling OS X?
