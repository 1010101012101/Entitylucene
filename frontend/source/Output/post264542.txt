Alfred searching through directories and filenames at the same time <body> Lets say I have the following structure:  code~/DOCUMENTATION/UBUNTU/CHECKINSTALL reference.txt/code  Is there a way to configure Alfred so that when I type in the search bar "ubuntu checkinstall" it would find this file?  <answer265550> One of Alfred's example workflows is strongDynamic File Search/strong. Here you enter the keyword or press a hotkey, then enter the folder, then the file. In the images, I've used the default keyword activation of ‘ff’, however you can set up a keyboard shortcut to go directly to dynamic file search. Once a folder is found, press enter to start searching for files within.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILZDE.png" width="500" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B25KQ.png" width="500" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HldBV.png" width="500" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H5giL.png" width="500"  To activate this workflow, open Alfred Preferences → Workflows, click the + at the bottom to add a new workflow and select Examples → Dynamic File Search.  <comment332788> You could probably define a workflow which uses `locate` for the search
