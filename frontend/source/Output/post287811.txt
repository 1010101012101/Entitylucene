Why am I unable to change the password on my Mac? <body> I recently purchased my Macbook Air from school and they said that they have disconnected it from their server. But when I try to change the password for the admin account it shows me the following message:     The server is not available. Change your password when the server becomes available.   How can I fix this?  <answer287855> I looked around into this issue and there must have been an error when the computer was disconnected from the AD (Active Directory) and the domain controller. One thing I read is that reconnecting it back to the AD/server and disconnecting it again will allow you to change your password. That method was discovered from here. Another thing could be an error with the school's domain controller. The systems administrator setting a preferred domain controller can fix this issue as pointed out here.  <comment363411> Password for what? User, Admin, some website?? <comment363416> Not sure if https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202860 applies. Could you edit your post to show what specific scenario you are using to change a password? <comment363435> Trying to change the password for the admin account. @SolarMike
