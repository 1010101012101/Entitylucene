How do I find the version number of system libraries in different versions of OS X? <body> My specific situation is that I am trying to find out whether Apple bumped the system version of libcairo to 1.12.16 in Yosemite from an earlier version of libcairo in Mavericks.  I can somewhat easily find the version on my current system by inspecting the header files, but I can't seem to find that information online.  strongDoes there exist a reference online for all the files included in different versions of OS X, or a way to find versions of system libraries (short of having access to a computer running a specific version of OS X)?/strong  Failing that, I'd appreciate someone running Mavericks taking a peek in code/opt/X11/include/cairo/cairo-version.h/code and telling me the version listed there.  <answer152343> Look at the Apple pages listing the open source products in each release. Unfortunately the Yosemite page has not been added yet.  <answer195177> To answer the specific question, in newer releases, codelibcairo/code is part of cairo, which is part of XQuartz rather than the Apple-supplied X11 installation. You can find out the supplied version by checking the page for the release in question - for example, here for 2.7.7.  As has been answered by Mark, the Apple Open Source site provides listings of all of the open source software included in each release.  <comment179219> Apple does not make such things public. You may consider visiting an Apple Store as they all their Macs are running Yosemite to gather the information you require. <comment179220> Bummer, I thought that might be the case. My issue is that I am running Yosemite and trying to figure out which version of libcairo is in Mavericks. <comment179254> /opt/X11 is not part of anything installed by Apple <comment179300> Mark's answer below is helpful in showing this - the Open Source pages he linked do not reference libcairo at all. <comment179462> Mark's comment above may be more useful--it looks like libcairo may not be included in Yosemite, and something else installed it.
