Create animated PNGs (APNG) <body> Safari 8 supports the unofficial APNG extension to the standardized PNG format.   Most popular image editors (on any platform) do not support APNG (yet). Plugins are mostly available for Windows software only. Searching Macupdate returned nil as well.   How can I generate an APNG from a series of still PNGs (not from a video file) on OS X? (Although I understand the file structure, I’m hesitant to do it manually.)  <answer144193> I have only used APNG Assembler for Windows. It appears that the GUI version is only for Windows, but command line versions exist for both Linux and Mac OS X. Using the CLI version (or writing a UI wrapper for it, if you have any development experience) may be a possibility.   Alternatively, you can use an online service such as this online APNG Assembler. I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this solution, however.  <comment169893> There are some python-based options if you search around. <comment247261> A year later, I finally came round to accept this as an answer, although using the terminal never feels really “macish”. There is something on the App Store now, though, which looks like a GUI wrapper to apngasm: [PNG Animator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/png-animator/id899480442).
