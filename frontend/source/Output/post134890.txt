Postfix SSL/TLS certificates issue <body> I'm trying to set up postfix to send mail through Gmail's SMTP server on port 587. Here's what I've put in my code/etc/postfix/main.cf/code:  precoderelayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587 smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem smtp_use_tls = yes /code/pre  However, I'm running into TLS problem since code/etc/postfix/cacert.pem/code, which seems to be suggested everywhere online, doesn't really exist on my system (OS X 10.9.3).  strongTherefore, what is the right CAfile to use?/strong Any help is greatly appreciated.  hr  On a side note, for now I'm using the workaround  precodesmtp_tls_security_level = may /code/pre  which works. However, I suppose this is a cheap fix, and I'm worried about the security.  <answer134894> The option specifies where the root certificates of the trusted issuers are located.  On OS X they are stored in the Keychain.  You can extract them with  precode$ sudo security find-certificate -a -p /System/Library/Keychains/SystemRootCertificates.keychain &gt; /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /code/pre  And then  precodesmtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /code/pre  strongEdit/strong Keep in mind that when Apple updates the root certificates in the Keychain you will have to export them again.  <answer219676> You can set up Postfix to send email through your Google account on modern OS Xs by adding the following lines to code/etc/postfix/main.cf/code (eg. by codesudo sh -c 'cat &gt;&gt; /etc/postfix/main.cf'/code):  precoderelayhost=smtp.gmail.com:587 smtp_sasl_auth_enable=yes smtp_sasl_password_maps=hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd smtp_sasl_security_options=noanonymous smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter=plain smtp_use_tls=yes smtp_tls_security_level=encrypt tls_random_source=dev:/dev/urandom /code/pre  Then generate an application-specific password and use it to create the contents of code/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd/code (eg. by codesudo sh -c 'cat &gt; /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd/code):  precodesmtp.gmail.com:587 my_email_address@gmail.com:my_app_spec_password /code/pre  (Remember to fix permissions, eg. codesudo chmod 440 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd/code).  Start the postfix server (if it is not already started)  precode$ sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master /code/pre  or (if postfix is already started) reload the configuration  precode$ sudo postfix reload /code/pre  Now your can send email from the command line:  precode$ mailx -s 'Test email 1' my_email_address@gmail.com Testing, testing...^D /code/pre  The mail server stops again at some point, so you might need to start it again the next time you need to use it:  precode$ sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master /code/pre  <comment159810> Thank you for the solution and clarification. It worked. <comment159813> Hmm, do you know how often Apple updates root certificates? I'll run a cron job for that. <comment159816> Also note that Google publishes a .pem file of root CA certs you should trust when connecting to Google. It's available from their PKI FAQ here: https://pki.google.com/faq.html. The PEM file itself is here: https://pki.google.com/roots.pem <comment159817> @KevinSayHi Actually I don't really know (I never checked)
