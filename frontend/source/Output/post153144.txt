How to disable camera on iOS devices in specific locations using a configuration profile or app <body> What I need to do is to disable the iOS camera (and any apps using the camera, of course) when entering a specific location. I know that I can use a configuration profile that disables the camera completely, but that's unacceptable.  <answer153145> According to the Configuration Profile Reference, it is not possible to restrict functionality based on geolocation. As you note you can disable the camera entirely, but that is the only current option.  <comment180563> Yeah, I realize that the config profile probably doesn't allow it. However, there might be an API that an app can use to disable the camera. Again, I'm just fishing -- I wasn't able to find any information on that either. <comment180613> Unless you talking about a jailbroken phone, what one app does cannot affect the entire system. If an app were able to disable the camera, it would only disable it while _in that app_.
