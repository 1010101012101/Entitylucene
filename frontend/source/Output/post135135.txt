How to write out a NORMAL tilde sign (~) in Mac? <body> I switched to Mac recently. The only thing that's disturbing me until now is the missing of the tilde sign (~). The closest thing I achieved to this sign is the accent tilde (˜). My passwords are not satisfied with that second little tilde sign.  I'm using a U.S International PC keyboard layout.  How do I make the tilde sign work on my Mac?  <answer135140> You type the accent tilde (shift `) then space: ~  <answer135141> You might consider switching "U.S. International strongPC/strong layout" to "U.S. layout" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiHXl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer220319> Try using Shift+Page Down. I don't know Apple keyboard layout (I'm using a Hackintosh) but it works for me.   <answer250822> Try  hold option key down and type n release option key and type n again   ñ  <answer258461> I just pressed all bottons and found that if you press alt + ¨ you will get ~  <answer262938> On my U.S. layout keyboard it works to use codeshift/code+code\/code (button next to left shift, see the screenshot). I believe the same button is above the enter key on MacBooks from other countries.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujXXE.jpg" alt="MacBook keyboard" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hzUT4.png" alt="keyboard preferences"  <answer273098> For those readers who want to make tilde accents over characters instead of the NORMAL tilde sign (~) requested by Aborted, here is some possibly useful info:  kbdOption/kbdkbdN/kbd applies a code~/code to the next codea/code, codeo/code, or coden/code that you type (given that you release them first). In the event that your keyboard/keyboard settings do not afford you the character,  more modified character options are available in the keyboard preferences option available from the toolbar in the upper right corner. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SgcD7.png" alt="keyboardOptionsTab" select "Latin" from the option on the left, then double click on your desired character to insert at your cursor. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DFNeq.png" alt="characterOptions" Another option is the Accent Menu you get when you hold down the key for the base letter, as described by Apple here  <answer278406> On a Finnish Mac keyboard layout (probably applies to some other international keyboard layouts as well) the tilde can be produced with the key with the symbols kbd^¨/kbd. That is on the left side of kbdEnter/kbd and below the kbdBackspace/kbd key.  When pressing kbdAlt/kbd kbd^¨/kbd and kbdspace/kbd the tilde code~/code appears.  <answer278968> On a French Mac keyboard, type kbd⌥/kbd+kbdN/kbd to write the code~/code character.  <comment160148> There is no need to do that. <comment160149> I have to do Option + n to get the little tilde, but Shift + the key under ESC only displays ±. I'm used to the PC formats which do as you suggested (without the extra space), but it's not the case on my Mac. <comment160152> I've tried what you said, but even the U.S layout gives me § without shift and ± with a shift press. Suggestions? <comment160153> It's probably on the key that located between `Shift` and `Z`. Make sure you have "Show Input menu in the Menu bar" selected, and open `Keyboard viewer` from the menu bar to see you keyboard. <comment160160> Then it is shift + the key to the left of z.  Is ` not marked on that? <comment216593> On MacBook Pro with norwegian keyboard: type  `Alt+^`.. <comment266740> What about hardware? Are you using a Mac style keyboard? Or your old PC style keyboard? <comment311575> But the question is how to type tilde ~, not how to type ñ.  You should delete this answer since it makes it look like you failed to read the question. <comment322345> `Alt + n` then space gives me ˜. shift ` gives me ±. <comment322383> @ThomasAhle What is the name of the Input Source you are using?  These instructions are for US International PC. <comment322397> That's the one. On Sierra. I also tried all other English qwerty layouts with similar luck. Eventually I found out the button between shift and Z works. <comment322419> @ThomasAhle Still, if you see the US flag with the little pc underneath in the top right corner of your screen, then Option n plus space should always give you ~., like it does for me here. <comment322436> I meant Alt. Option + N gives me a new window in most programs. <comment322453> @ThomasAhle You seem to be confusing those keys.  Alt and Option are the same key.  New window is Command n (⌘ n).  Alt/Option n plus space should produce ~. <comment329407> The question is about the US International PC layout.  Plus your answer is already covered by the one from Sergei. <comment330150> This answer helped
