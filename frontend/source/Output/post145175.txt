IPhone 5s Contacts not saving <body> I have an iPhone I got recently but when I try to upload contacts onto the phone one contact is uploaded, while the previous one erases..every time I put a contact it saves..but after I put another one the previous erases..my contacts aren't being saved.br Why??  <comment171054> Are you sure you're actually adding new contacts and not just repeatedly editing the same contact? <comment171058> Yes I Press The + Button To Add A New Contact And Then It Adds The New Contact But When I Go Back another One Deletes <comment171088> Upload from where ? <comment172735> @alejandroguillen Did you click the "Done" button once you added the information?
