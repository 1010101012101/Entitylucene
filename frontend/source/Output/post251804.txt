How can I justify to my new boss that I need to switch my HP for an Apple? <body> So I just got a new job at a research lab. It's a great place, very fun and engaging, etc.  However, everyone uses HPs there. I'm a lifelong Apple guy and not eager to make the switch to Windows 10 or whatever they are using. I gave it an honest effort over the past week and I hate everything about it. I'm not an Apple fanboy or anything, but I'm just accustomed to it.  I think if I had a good technical/practical reason to switch from Windows to OS, they may go along with it. They are reasonable people here after all. So, for example, if I told them I need OS because it has some feature that Windows doesn't have (not just aesthetics or usability) maybe they'd be swayed.  Do you guys know of any good motivation? Ugh...  <answer251809> It depends on the field of research but I use OSX in research largely through the command line. Bash, Python, version control (git) are all seamless in OSX, and require additional installation, configuration, and work arounds in Windows.   I suspect this might be a sigmaplot operation that you haver joined. ;^) Whatever other tools the lab might use (R, Matlab, labview) are probably cross compatible between osx and windows, so your choice will not affect collaborating, and they basically will not notice. If there is any software that you strongmust/strong use and is strongonly/strong windows, you can get VMware or Parallels.   At one point about 10 years ago or director started considering/threatening to make everyone use Windows. It is funny how the pendulum has swung  back towards OSX, and you see a majority of MacBooks now, at least at the conferences I attend. Good luck dragging them into the 21st century!
