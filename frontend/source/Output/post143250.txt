Is there a simple script to duplicate files into a new folder based on a csv file? <body> Our challenge is that we need to search and duplicate approx 3000 images into a new folder.   The list of image names is a csv file. The files are all on one drive, but in many different folders.  <answer143327> I would use applescript.    Open the csv file in excel grab the files, then pass the variable to the terminal where you would execute a codefind/code command followed by a codecopy/code command to the directory of your choice.   Here is some pointers:  ul liExecuting commands from applescript;/li liHow to open an excel file from the command line, and/li liOpen a file in applescript./li /ul  Loop through the csv.  <answer143335> Using Bash:  precode#!/bin/bash  cat /path/to/file.csv | while IFS=, read col1 col2 col3 do     find . -path "$col1" -exec cp {} /DESIRED/DIRECTORY \; done /code/pre  ul licodeIFS/code is the input field separator. Declare as code,/code for code.csv/code./li licodefind . -path/code searches through your home directory recursively for names read from codecol1/code, returning the full path.  /li licodeexec/code executes the codecp/code command on code{}/code, which represents all the results codefind/code returns/li lithe files are copied to code/DESIRED/DIRECTORY/code and code\;/code is required for terminating the codeexec/code command /li /ul  <answer143348> Here's a simple python script that will do the trick:  precodeimport csv, subprocess  csv_path = '/Users/mdryden/Desktop/test2/test.csv' search_path = '/Users/mdryden/Desktop/test2/' output_path = '/Users/mdryden/Desktop/test3/'  with open(csv_path, 'rb') as csvfile:     dialect = csv.Sniffer().sniff(csvfile.read(1024))     csvfile.seek(0)     reader = csv.reader(csvfile, dialect)     for line in reader:         subprocess.call(["find", search_path, "-name", line[0],                         "-exec", "cp", "{}", output_path,";"]) /code/pre  Set csv_path, search_path, and output_path accordingly. It it's any sort of remotely standard CSV format, it should be able to autodetect it.The CSV should have no header rows and you need to set codeline[0]/code to the number of the column containing the file names (starting at 0 for the first column).  <comment168765> Can you add a sample of the cvs file (just a few lines)?
