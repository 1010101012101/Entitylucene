macOS Sierra — Changing the pre-boot login screen profile picture <body> Is there a way to replace the (ugly) profile picture on the pre-boot login screen:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0LR8R.jpg" alt="profile picture on the pre-boot login screen"  …with my iCould profile picture on macOS Sierra (10.12.3)?  <comment346290> I find that this picture only shows up on my main user account right after startup. Oddly, my other user accounts all show the images they're supposed to show right after a restart, but that main one shows the weird shadowy image above.
