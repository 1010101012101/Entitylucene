How can I update multiple MacBook Airs from Mavericks to Yosemite utilizing ARD? <body> I have multiple MacBook Airs on Mavericks that need to be updated to Yosemite. I currently have a Mac Mini Server on 10.9.5 â€“ I'm using the Caching service to download the software to have it locally available. Is there any way I can use ARD to assist in this process so that way I don't have to click through the installer screens and automate some of the process? Thank you in advance.
