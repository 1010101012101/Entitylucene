editing quoted text in Gmail iOS app <body> The new Gmail iOS app (version 5.0.4) no longer allows me to edit quoted text in reply and forwarded messages. This is a serious limitation.  Is there a fix or a workaround, short of copying the entire quoted text, pasting it into Notes, editing it, and pasting the result back in Gmail?  (Despite the new look, version 5 seems to be a step in the wrong direction. The previous version worked just fine.)  <answer264355> This seems to have been fixed in version 5.0.7.
