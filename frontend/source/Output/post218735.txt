How to stop Snow Leopard from prompting me to upgrade to El Capitan? <body> I have a 2008 MacBook with Snow Leopard on it.  I don't want to upgrade to newer OS versions.  Snow Leopard keeps prompting me to upgrade to El Capitan.  Is there any way to get it to stop this permanently?  <comment264471> Disable software updates. <comment310737> @JohnKeates That doesn't work. I have "Check for updates" unchecked, but it still occasionally nags me about upgrading to El Cap. I'm running Snow Leopard under VirtualBox on an El Cap machine, I don't need to upgrade the VM. <comment310738> In what manner does it prompt you? Is it via the AppStore, via a notification popup or some other means?
