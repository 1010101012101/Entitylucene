Are the iPhone 7 EarPods longer? <body> I just got an iPhone 7 Plus and noticed that the EarPod's cable is much longer than the one I had with the iPhone 6s.  Do both the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus come with longer earphone cables than the 6s and the 6s Plus?  <answer253195> You've answered your own question - if you see that they are longer, then they are obviously shipped with longer headphones - but for everyone else, I compared them.  The distance from the cord split to the ends of the headphones is the same; however, the distance from the edge of the connector to the split is approximately two inches longer on the iPhone 7 (Lightning connector) EarPods than on the iPhone 6s EarPods.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NHqPM.jpg" alt="Comparison of EarPods shipped with iPhone 7, on left, and iPhone 6s, on right, showing the latter are a couple of inches longer"  <answer257228> yes. It is longer for both iPhone 7 and 7 plus.  <comment315336> Is it longer because I got the Plus? Or are all iPhone 7 earphones this long. <comment315360> @AndrewWarner As noted in my answer I tested with iPhone 7, not Plus. <comment321113> Welcome to Ask Different.
