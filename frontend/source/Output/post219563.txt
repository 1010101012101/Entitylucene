Why is iBooks progress incorrect in my Siri Suggestions, and how is this fixed? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4Yf4.jpg" alt="Siri Suggestions Screenshot"  In this case, Siri Suggestions implies that I have just started the book. I've actually been reading it for weeks and am on page 685/1985. Clicking the Siri Suggestion for the book brings me to the correct page. This is on iOS 9.1 (13B143).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMBCK.jpg" alt="iBooks Screenshot"  <answer247096> Go to SettingsGeneralSpotlight Search. Turn off and on Siri Suggestions. It worked for me.  <comment274124> Mine's showing *Finished*. It's fixed when I restarted my iPhone.
