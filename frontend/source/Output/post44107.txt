iMessage Sync - Inconsistent? <body> I have iMessage installed on my iPhone and both of my macs - but when I've read a message on my iPhone, it remains unread on both macs - although this does not happen the other way around. I get quite a few messages and its getting tiresome going through telling it I've read them - is there any way to force a sync between all the machines?  <comment50114> It's in Beta for a reason, it's not 100% baked.  I would wait for the V1.0 release before asking such questions. <comment50117> Excellent point. I'll vote my post for closure. <comment50120> We kind semi-officially included messages as ontopic despite being beta, so the question is valid, I just don't think you will get any sensible answers just yet.
