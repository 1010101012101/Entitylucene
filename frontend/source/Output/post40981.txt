How are filesystems mounted in Lion? <body> I posted a question a while back regarding network mounts.  But I have a more general question. If Lion no longer uses code/etc/fstab/code how are standard mounts in addition to network mounts handled? I would like to be able to customize this.  For instance how is root mounted and such? Also for instance, how is removable media mounted?  <answer44056> I know this is probably a bit late for your uses, but my understanding is that this is determined by the file code/etc/auto_master/code. You should read codeauto_master/code's documentation here or running codeman auto_master/code in the Terminal.  <comment50211> FYI: OS X still respects fstab entries.
