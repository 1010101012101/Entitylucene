Incorrect icon of Time Capsule in Finder <body> Have a little perfectionistic problem: quite often in Finder Time Capsule's icon not displayed correctly, when I click on it - becomes normal, what's the problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWAw0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer146969> That's one of the bugs which Mavericks 10.9.4 has. So you can't do anything beside waiting and hoping, that apple will fix this issue in a future update.  <answer151925> Also I have this problem in OS 10.10 Yosemite and it's continues to give me the inconvenience, so I googled till I find the answer. Finally, I'm trying to do this: make sure that the TC is not mounted (or dismount it). Then in finder menu use Go - Connect to Server. Type AFP://TCnetworkname or IPaddress (replace with the real IP or real network name). When the computer finds the TC, you need to give a password (public for default) type in your password if you changed it or public if not, then save it in your keychain. That's it.
