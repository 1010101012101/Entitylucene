"Internet Sharing" via "Ethernet" is not working <body> I'm using OS X El Capitan (10.11) on my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) and I'm trying to use System Preferences - Sharing - Internet Sharing feature and something isn't working...  I made sure that strongShare your connection from.../strong is set to strongWi-Fi/strong as that's my source of internet, and strongTo computers using.../strong is set to strongThunderbolt Ethernet/strong as that's where my Raspberry Pi is plugged in via crossover ethernet cable.  I'm not seeing any IP address assigned via Network Utility on Thunderbolt Ethernet (not 100% sure if it should, but I'd assume it should).  Any help?  <answer231120> Apple Network Sharing is very unreliable across different OS and different network channels. I've lost a lot of time on this. Enough so that I'd suggest getting a simple good quality router and setting it up to pick up the wifi ethernet and redistribute it via ethernet. Make sure to set the access point router to act as a bridge (i.e. it would continue to obtain DHCP addresses from the central router). That way you can share to other devices on the master network.  You may find you get faster and more reliable internet on your MacBook Pro as well as the aluminum hulls are not particularly reception friendly, especially in comparison with a router with proper antennas which can be positioned as you like.  I'm doing something similar but using powerline adapters (more reliable than wifi) to bring the internet to the access point router.  <comment287474> Dear downvoters if you don't have useful answers on this topic, you shouldn't be downvoting the one above. I've spent tens of hours trying to solve and document internet sharing issues with Apple OS. Internet sharing does not work reliably. It's a dead end: I'm only guilty of trying to save other AskDifferent members from falling down the same rabbit hole.
