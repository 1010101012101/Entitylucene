Open application several times in OS X <body> I am developing OS X version of multi-platform application. In Windows I can start several instances of application by just opening exe file several times.  I noticed that in OS X when I open my app it appears on panel, and when I start it for the second time - nothing happens.  Can I configure my app (edit .app folder) so it can start several instances of same app? I mean without reconfiguring my Mac, so I can deliver configured app to users. Is it possible?  <answer203077> You may open a second instance of an application by entering in Terminal.app:  precodeopen -n /Path/To/Application.app /code/pre  Some apps (e.g. iTunes.app) don't open an additional instance.  <comment244924> The quick answer is no - however what sort of app is this, why do you want multiple instances? <comment244926> @Mark GUI app with one window. Can I somehow catch some system call when user opens app second time to do some action like draw another window? <comment244928> That is known as opening a new window - look at NSDocument and apps based on that
