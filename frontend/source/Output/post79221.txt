Cmd + Tab showing different windows from a single app? <body> Is there a way for Cmd+Tab to display all of the instances/windows of an app?  An excellent example is here: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJoHI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice how it shows the available instances of that application? That's what I'm looking for.  <answer79237> Witch does exactly that, with a ton of configuration options. It can also use the default strongCmd - Tab/strong shortcut.  <answer83013> If you don't care about seeing the window thumbnails, kbd⌘ - `/kbd (the key above the Tab key) switches between open instances of an app.  <comment91553> I don't think it's happening. Since OS X has a feature called "Mission Control", little people make windows manager app for OS X. Use Mission Control under "Application Window" mode, find it under System Preferences. <comment91600> Functionally it's nearly perfect. The only issue is it has to be activated in each Desktop before it can read the windows in that desktop - but apparently that isn't Witch's fault. Thanks! <comment91631> I'm very familiar with Mission Control. It just doesn't do what I need. <comment96117> At first glance this appears to be limited to instances that are in the same space/desktop. Is that correct? <comment124482> I later found [DockView](http://kapeli.com/dockview) which looks great, but I have yet to try it. <comment230109> Seems it's not working on OS X Yosemite :( <comment230537> @artnikpro I use it in Yosemite. Have you customized your shortcuts? See [this image](https://imgur.com/gallery/bIzSE7m/new). <comment230815> @shabdar I have the same settings as you. I tried to use the combination on a few opened windows of Chrome and Finder. Not working for me :( <comment248609> If the window has an active text field, then ⌘ - ` ends up typing a  ` inside the text field instead of switching windows.
