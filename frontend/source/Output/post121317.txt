com.apple.IconServices is causing high CPU usage and Finder problems in Mavericks. How to fix this? <body> In OS X Mavericks, com.apple.IconServices seems to be causing almost 100% CPU usage and is causing Finder to become unresponsive (the "beach ball"). This happens periodically, usually when accessing a directory in Finder for the first time in a while. Restarting Finder stops IconServices from eating all the CPU, but revisiting the problem directory makes the problem happen again. How do I solve this?  <answer121318> Apple user Kieran Healy has apparently solved the root problem and come up with a fix, described on his blog here. The short of it is to open Terminal and then enter the following command:  precodemkdir ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices /code/pre  Apparently, IconServices was seeking a directory and, failing to find it, began thrashing. Kieran's fix creates that directory.   When I tried this solution, the fix was immediate -- that is, no restarting, relaunching, or even re-visiting of directories was required.   All credit goes to Kieran Healy for this fix. I suggest visiting his website and giving him a "like".  <answer143834> This blog post shows how to find out exactly what IconServicesAgent and coreservicesd are up to when they're thrashing your Finder.  In a nutshell, grep the output of fs_usage to find out what files are being icon-serviced all the time.  Specific command lines are given, and the files that were causing their problems are the same ones I'm seeing.  The fs_usage invocation is a valuable diagnostic tool, especially if your problem isn't quite the same.  If this works for people, please pass the message on to this related question.  I don't have the reputation to answer it myself.  <comment141425> I'm happy to up-vote this answer :) <comment141447> Thanks, Kieran. It's worth noting that user cybeross says here https://discussions.apple.com/message/24897406?ac_cid=tw123456#24897406 that he found the fix to be only temporary. I'm going to keep an eye out and update my answer if I encounter this issue again. Also, he suspects that the issue seems to crop up with Google Drive, Tabbed Finder Windows, and/or Dropbox. If anyone can confirm that, please note it here or in the thread at the link above. <comment141564> Yes, it's not a permanent fix: the underlying bug is clearly something that Apple will have to fix themselves. I don't think it's an issue that can be permanently addressed from the user side. <comment167598> mine gives me this: $sudo mkdir ${TMPDIR}/com.apple.IconServices mkdir: /var/folders/_r/swmf_sy565v7q3gn18n4p3qh0000gn/T//com.apple.IconServices: File exists it didn't solve it
