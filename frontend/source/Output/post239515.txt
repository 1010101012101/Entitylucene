Tried to update to El Capitan, now I can't boot at all <body> After trying to install El Capitan and getting several notices that it can't be installed, now when I boot the computer it seems to be stuck in a login loop or something.   Every time I restart the computer now I see the grey progress bar start as though it's doing something (with Apple logo), it goes for a bit and then shuts the machine off.   I have tried holding kbdShift/kbd while powering on into safe mode, but it has no effect. I cant even boot now, just a loop.   I have also tried using kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd to reinstall OSX 10.8.5 but it says the disk is locked. I chose reboot from 10.8.5 disk, but it simply goes back to the loading progress bar loop.   Was upgrading from 10.8.5.

How does this even happen? <comment293972> It depends on the specific error of the notice when your install failed. If nothing ever failed, we wouldn't make backups or need to troubleshoot anything, no? <comment293973> im curious how a perfectly working machine went to having a failed disk from a simple update/ <comment293975> In my experience Its almost always the other way around - failed disks or corrupt data ruin simple updates. You can't know unless you analyze the system carefully and then repeat / isolate the failure. <comment293976> That makes sense. I tried to reinstall OSX from Recovery mode after formatting the drive (didnt work because i didn't do journaled format, so im waiting for that to finish before i try again), but.. the system by default was trying to install 10.7. Is there a reason it automatically tried to install an older version of OSX instead of a more recent one from Recovery mode? I mean, the disk was blank..
