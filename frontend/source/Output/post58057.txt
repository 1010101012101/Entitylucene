You can either install them from inside Xcode or just download them separately. See my answer here for more details: I installed Xcode but I still don&#39;t have gcc in my terminal.  <comment66824> thanks for your answers. But I still find a lot of other libraries can't be found in mountain lion that are depended by existing libraries. How should I resolve this? <comment66830> What are you trying to do? Have you ever used [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)? <comment66832> I installed Zend CE server on 10.7. It works well. However it doesn't work after I upgraded Mac to mountain lion. I found some system libraries depended by php of Zend CE can't be found in 10.8. <comment66835> This sounds like a completely different question, perhaps you should post it separately. It might also help to ask the community of Zend CE. <comment67232> thanks for your information. I found a workaround for my php issue. <comment67233> I rolled back your changes to the original question. I think it was more clear, and since you marked my answer as correct then I think it should stay this way. If you still have questions about other libraries, you should probably just start a new question.
