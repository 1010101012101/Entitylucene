Alternative pdf readers that don't use native PDFKit Render engine <body> I've been running into a lot of bugs using Apple's native Preview App, and it seems like other common alternatives like PDFPenPro, Skim, and PDF Reader Expert all use the same PDFKit engine.  Other than Adobe's Adobe Reader DC, are there any clean and fast alternative pdf readers?  <comment364533> With X11 `mupdf` is one option. <comment364630> There doesn't seem to be a mac download for mupdf <comment364631> It looks like you might be able to mupdf using Homebrew <comment364873> mupdf is available via MacPorts or Homebrew or possibly Fink and will also need XQuartz for X11.
