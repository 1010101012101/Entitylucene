Finder "Show Icon Preview" for certain filetypes? <body> In OSX (Yosemite) I've figured out how to switch between showing a file as an icon or as a preview in Finder.  I can go to emFinder  View  Show View Options/em and then toggle the emShow icon preview/em checkbox.  What I'm wondering is if there is some way to show the preview for certain file types but not for others.  Basically, I want to see the preview if it is an image file, but just see the file type icon for everything else (.doc(x), .pdf, .txt, etc.).  Is there a way to do this, or is it strictly one way or the other?
