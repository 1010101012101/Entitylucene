PRAM and NVRAM differences and overlap with eachother and UEFI firmware chip <body> ol liIs PRAM stored on the same NVRAM chip that non-PRAM variables are stored.  I always assumed that NVRAM was the UEFI firmware chip on the logic board. Are all of these one in the same (NVRAM - PRAM - UEFI firmware), basically are they all stored on the same chip?/li liHow do you set the PRAM variables like you set the NVRAM variables with the nvram command./li /ol  Thanks :-)  <answer40452> Yes, PRAM is stored on the same NVRAM chip as the firmware variables, but it is managed separately.  It actually shows up as a device in the firmware device tree.  HT1242: What's stored in PRAM  When you reset one, you reset the other.  HT1379: Resetting your Mac's PRAM and NVRAM  AFAIK, Apple has never supported direct developer access to PRAM, so it is not documented well (or at all).  The functions codereadXPRAM/code and codewriteXPRAM/code can be used to access the raw bytes, although these days they are just wrappers around IOKIT functions which access the codeAPL,MacOS75/code partition in NVRAM.  The codenvram/code command line program only manipulates the firmware variables stored in NVRAM, and so does not let you access the PRAM partition.
