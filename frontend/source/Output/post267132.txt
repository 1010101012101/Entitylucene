iOS Safari Repeatedly Opens "Virus Detected" Emails <body> On my iPad 2 (running iOS 9) there's a "Virus Detected" email popping up that I can neither delete or change. No matter what I do, the "Virus Detected" email keeps opening on my screen whenever I attempt to use Safari.  I've attempted to delete the email, change the email and to close Safari but the email keeps returning and makes using the browser impossible. I have no intention to either call the provided phone number or sending this email as it directs me to do. The email is as follows:  codeTo:/code foo@example.com br codeSubject/code: Warning! Virus Detected! Immediately Call Apple Support +1-800-876-6855. Your credit card details and banking information. Your e-mail passwords and other account passwords.Your Facebook, Skype, AIM, ICQ and other.Call Apple Support +1-800-876-6855. Your private photos, family photos and other sensitive files.Your webcam could be accessed remotely by stalkers with a VPN virus. br codeCC/code: bar@example.com br codeMessage:/code Apple Tech Support  strongHow do I remove this email and regain access to my browser?/strong   <answer267134> Basically, this is a website that repeatedly spawns email templates by repeatedly opening a new tab with a codemailto:/code link, causing iOS to open email templates repeatedly. This is a known vulnerability in iOS, fixed in iOS 10.2.   To fix the issue without updating your software, go to codeSettings/code - codeSafari/code - codeClear Website and History Data/code. Alternatively, on an iPhone 6S (or newer) with 3D Touch, you can force-press on the Safari icon, open a codeNew Tab/code, then immediately press down and hold the tab switcher icon, and hit codeClose All Tabs/code.  Learn more about this issue.  strongNote:/strong This is fixed in iOS 10.2 (which, sadly, your iPad 2 can't update to), which prevents websites from opening codemailto:/code links until the user specifically approves it.  <comment335101> @Tetsujin It's a different question, but with the same answer. <comment335102> hmmm...ok - not one I've come across. Guess I don't go down the rough end of the playground ;-) <comment335103> Gotta love the ol' VPN virus :). <comment336523> Hey there, did my answer help? If it did, do you mind accepting it with the checkmark button?
