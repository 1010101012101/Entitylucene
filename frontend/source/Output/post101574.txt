Prevent switching workspaces when clicking on dock icon <body> I am constantly running multiple applications on multiple workspaces. I want to remain on the same workspace, and only switch workspaces when I explicitly ask for it (e.g. with a magic mouse gesture).  Currently when I click on the app icon in the dock, osx switches to the next workspace that has a window of the active application.  I know there is an option in System Preferences - Misson Control, called em"When switching to an application, switch to a space with open windows for the application"/em. What it does: When clicking on the icon of an stronginactive/strong application, don't switch to a workspace that has the application window. But this option strongdoes not affect/strong the behaviour of clicking on an strongactive/strong application.  hr  The question: strongHow do I prevent OSX from ever switching to another wokspace when clicking on an app icon in the dock,/strong regardless of whether the app is active of inactive?  <answer101613> Open codeTerminal.app/code, then run the following commands.    Change the default workspace preference:       defaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool NO     Next, restart the Dock with this command:     killall Dock   References:br How can I disable auto-switching desktops?br Disable Space switching on Command-Tab  <answer196743> Unlike the original questioner, I was trying to strongenable this effect/strong. I wanted to switch between spaces where applications lived on different desktops.   I just took a guess at:   precodedefaults write com.apple.dock workspaces-auto-swoosh -bool TRUE /code/pre  and  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  The two commands above worked like a charm to restore the effect.  <comment119759> It's worth noting that this solution also disables the swtiching from any other dock action, like application expos√© view or the right-click full application window list. Nonetheless, I like it much more. Thanks! <comment322266> Do you have a fix for MacOS Sierra? This doesn't seem to work anymore...
