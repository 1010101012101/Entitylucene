Add a Proxy to your computer via terminal <body> How would I add and activate a proxy for my computer via terminal (without going into System Preferences.) Can I do that with codescutil --proxy/code somehow?  <answer235370> You can use networksetup.  See man networksetup for a full list.  Run this command via terminal.app  Example: setting http proxies.  precodesudo networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi proxy.yourdomain 9090  sudo networksetup -setproxybypassdomains Wi-Fi website1, website2, website3 /code/pre  Replace Wi-Fi with the approiate service name (wifi, ethernet, ..).  <comment287880> So this would look like: `networksetup -setwebproxy Wi-Fi skyzip.com 9090` and `networksetup -setproxybypassdomains Wi-Fi https://www.youtube.com https://www.google.com` <comment287882> If 9090 is the port your using than yes.  Also your sites are https, which needs to be enabled under -setsecurewebproxy. <comment287883> So i'd just do `networksetup -setsecurewebproxy Wi-Fi skyzip.com 9090` instead? <comment287885> Depends on your needs really.  If you want to proxy both http and https than you would enable both of them.  If you just want to send https to a proxy than just enable -setsecurewebproxy and set your bypass domains.
