Stop iCloud popup from displaying <body> While I'm using my Mac (OS X  Yosemite), the following pop-up displays directly after boot and every few hours after that  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EOJmUm.png" alt="picture"  The only  way to dismiss this is to click "Manage" and then quit System Preferences; this gets to be pretty annoying, so is there any way to stop this dialog from displaying? (other than upgrading my storage)  <comment249122> It's pretty persistent. You have two choices, increase storage or decrease what your trying to sync.   I finally caved and upgraded storage when the new pricing kicked in.
