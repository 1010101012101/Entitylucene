Macbook scrolling issues <body> My wife is having trouble scrolling using her Macbooks touchpad; but, I can scroll easily.  Seems to not react to her 'touch'.  Can the sensitivity be adjusted?  She thinks her fingers are too dry...  <comment319817> Is it only scrolling that does not work? If so, what additional finger does she use for scrolling? Can she move the cursor with that finger? <comment319836> Welcome to Ask Different!
