How do I connect to a wifi network from the login screen on OS X Mavericks? <body> I have a late 2012 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and it uses a network login system with my school.   This normally wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that I can't connect to a wifi network from the login screen.   Is there a way I can accomplish this so that I can log in and get this thing going?  I can't use an Ethernet cable, because the MacBook doesn't have a full Ethernet port, but it requires a Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, which I do not possess, and neither does my school.  <answer143201> Use a local account on your mac to connect to the WiFi, then logout again, you won't loose connection, and you'll only have to do this once since your Mac will remember the network.  <comment275960> This does not work for me. I initialized the Mac with a local admin account, then added an account set to use its icloud password. Upon logging out of the admin (or just using fast user switching) the wifi disconnects.
