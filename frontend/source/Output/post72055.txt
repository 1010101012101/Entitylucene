How to backup my iPhone 4S contacts to a CD? <body> Even though iTunes is backing up all my contacts while I'm syncing, the backup still exists on a computer. So I would like to make a backup on another physical medium, just in case my computer or iPhone gets destroyed, lost, stolen, etc....br How can I do this?  <answer72066> You can export your contacts from the codeContacts/code app, it will save them as a Address Book Backup file (code.abbu/code). Once you do that, you can drop the file into a burn cd folder and burn the CD.   emFile &lt; Export &lt; Contacts Archive/embr Save as a file that you can easily identify. (Contacts-date.abbu)  This of course only works if you sync your iPhone's contacts to your Address  Book app.  <answer72086> Another thing to try is syncing with iCloud, which will back-up/copy your contacts (among other items on your iPhone) into the Cloud and you could access it anywhere where you have an internet connection.  <answer148415> I use List.Up (www.listdotup.com) to backup/restore my iPhone contacts.   Each backup is timestamp, available in vCard format and can be download from List.Up Cloud.   <comment83817> You seem to be making the assumption that the OP owns and syncs their iPhone with a Mac. <comment83923> This being "Ask Different" Which seems mac centric, it seems prudent. What makes you think the OP syncs with anything but a mac when they ask a question here? <comment83926> This site is about *all* Apple hardware and software :) They could sync with a PC and ask a question here, as long as they're talking about an iPhone. Why, the first related question to the right is about a Windows sync setup. <comment83927> One thing you might want to add is that you can Command-A to select all of the cards and File  Export  Export vCard... This is definitely more compatible with other applications, whether it be Contacts, Outlook, Gmail, etc.
