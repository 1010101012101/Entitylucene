How to transfer Mac Yosemite Notes to Mac Sierra <body> I want to transfer my Notes app notes from one Macbook Pro (OSX Yosemite 10.10.5) to another (macOS Sierra 10.12.1).  I've been able to transfer notes just fine from Yosemite to Yosemite before by simply airdropping my codeNotesV4.storedata/code, codeNotesV4.storedata-shm/code and codeNotesV4.storedata-wal/code files in code/Users/myuser/Library/Containers/com.apple.Notes/Data/Library/Notes/code to my other Mac.  Sierra's Notes files are the same, but are codeNotesV6/code. After I replace the notes files, I can usually close and reopen Notes and my notes appear. If I transfer V4 files into V6 Notes, the files are removed and re-replaced with V6 files due to, I'm assuming, compatibility.  How else can I export notes then from an older Notes to a newer Notes?  hr  strongOn Yosemite:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JETEfm.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbJNQm.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongOn Sierra: (Where I'm trying to transfer)/strong  Same iCloud sync as above.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGjA7m.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer265520> Why not just sync your notes using iCloud?   If they aren’t currently associated with your iCloud account, just copy them over to that account (within the Notes app) on the machine running Yosemite. Then, enable iCloud on the machine running Sierra, checkmark “Notes” to sync under iCloud preferences, and then you’ve successfully transferred them.   It’s a much easier solution than navigating through the filesystem and manually selecting the data.  <answer265662> If they aren't as of now connected with your iCloud account, simply duplicate them over to that record (inside the Notes application) on the machine running Yosemite. At that point, empower iCloud on the machine running Sierra, checkmark "Notes" to match up under iCloud inclinations, and after that you've effectively exchanged them.  <answer280384> I'd upgrade the old MBP, so the notes would be converted in the process. Failing that, I'd create a small Yosemite partition on the newer MBP, copy the notes there and upgrade it to Sierra.  <comment332889> Okay I see in Notes now that `iCloud  Notes` appears on both computers, but are both blank. How can I transfer the notes I already have into iCloud? <comment332892> You can simply select all notes (command + A) within the notes app. It shouldn’t matter whether they are “on my Mac” or “gmail”, etc. Then, copy and paste to “All iCloud”. They will then transfer over to your iCloud. <comment332902> I have `iCloud` Notes and am even testing with a simple new note within my Yosemite `iCloud  Notes` - yet these notes aren't showing up on my Sierra laptop despite setting up iCloud on both <comment332903> Please see above edit <comment334310> No they still aren't syncing. On my Yosemite, I've tried creating a new test note under `iCloud Notes` within Notes app. My Sierra mac isn't syncing/picking up these notes. <comment334316> Doesn't seem possible to sync with notes on an OS older than El Capitan: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7677563?start=0&tstart=0 <comment347521> I tried this - but it doesn't work. It turns out that you cannot sync Yosemite notes to an iCloud account that is synchronized with Sierra notes. Can't find the link right now that confirms this.
