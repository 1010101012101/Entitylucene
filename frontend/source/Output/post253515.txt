Canâ€™t Enable Apple Watch Auto-Unlock <body> With macOS Sierra installed on a Mac from at least 2013 and an Apple Watch (the very first one), users should be able to unlock their Mac with their Apple Watch. I have an Early 2013 MacBook Pro and an Apple Watch, both of which have the most updated version of the OS installed. I followed these instructions to get it to work (checked 2 factor authentication is on, I have a password on my Watch), but I do not see the option to use my Watch to unlock under System Preferences. Any ides on why it does not work? Could it have something to do with me having 2 Apple IDs, one for iTunes and one for iCloud? Could it be my Mac is somehow not ready for this feature (although it is from 2013)?  <answer253659> Are you seeing the code"Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac"/code checkbox?  You may need to enable Continuity.  Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi network, and Bluetooth is enabled.  The article also had an error, it says      "[...] make sure that Disable Automatic Login is unchecked. If the   option is grayed out, you might need to click the padlock icon at the   bottom of the window to make the necessary changes."   I think they meant that the box is strongchecked/strong.  EDIT: Here's the Apple article you want to reference: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT206995  <comment315454> It could be a bug that will be resolved when the OS is officially released tomorrow. <comment315633> That article you linked was from a beta version so maybe they changed something for the release?  Take a look at [this recent article](http://www.macrumors.com/how-to/macos-sierra-apple-watch-unlock/) and see if following those steps help. <comment315686> Yes, you need to be signed in to the same AppleID. <comment315691> You says you have an Early-2013 MBP, on the page that @Harv linked in his answer, https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT206995, it says it needs an Mid-2013 or later MBP, maybe that is the case? <comment315719> I do not see that checkbox. And I know why... The article you linked says I need a mid-2013 Mac. I have an early-2013 one... That is sad. <comment315720> @TomShen Yes I think that is the problem.
