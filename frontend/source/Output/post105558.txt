Encrypted Mountain Lion is not booting, showing OS X utilities screen <body> My FileVault 2 encrypted OS X Mountain Lion setup is not booting, but instead showing the OS X utilities screen.  I have two accounts, User1 and User2. The encryption was enabled with User2's login credentials.  Everything was working fine but when I tried to access a guest account it showed a dialog saying it needs to restart the machine. The machine restarted but since then it's showing the OS X utilities screen.
