Verification required; help me please, iPhone 6 <body> My iPhone 6 won't let me download any apps. I've looked at other peoples questions about this problem and Apple Support but nothing has helped. I've signed out and signed back in, didn't work. I've tried everything. When I go into payment information, when it says select a card type I only have Visa, Master Card, Amex, and Paypal. I don't have a "none" button and I don't know how to get rid of my card. If someone knows, please help me.
