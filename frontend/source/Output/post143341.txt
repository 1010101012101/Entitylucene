Back to Mac service when using Unlocator DNS <body> I have a Mac Mini at home that I would like to connect to using the "Back to my Mac" service.  Normally it works just fine.  But if I update my Apple Airport Extreme with DNS from unlocator.com (or unblock-us.com), Iâ€™m not able to connect to the Mini when I'm not on the same local network as the Mini.  What could I do to fix this?  <comment281898> I'd love to hear more thoughts on this - I've been having numerous iCloud issues since using Unlocator. My current solution which seems to give me remote access is to go into System Preferences and turn off 'Back to my Mac' and then turn it on again. I have to say that I really wonder what iCloud is doing, as it shouldn't have anything to do with these things.
