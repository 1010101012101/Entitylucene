Does MacOS log of the distance of the corresponding WatchOS while unlocked? <body> I am looking for a log of some type that will help me understand the connection between MacOS and WatchOS.  I'm currently unlocking my Mac with the Watch, but all of a sudden it stopped working.  I'm looking for debug/diagnostic information for this purpose.  But while thinking about this, I would like my Mac to automatically lock when I walk away, or extend the inactivity timer if I'm (very) nearby.  What WatchOS/Mac log files should I inspect in relation to the MacOS/Watch connection?
