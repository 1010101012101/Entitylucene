Jailbreaking a locked iPhone 4s with iOS 6 <body> I received an iPhone 4S as a gift, branded by Orange UK. It runs iOS 6 (6.0.1(10A523)).   I didn't unlock it yet; I'm using it without a SIM and I'm enjoying the apps, but I want to jailbreak it.  What should I do know? I want to use it locked, but is there a jailbreak?  <answer76643> As of January 2013, there is no jailbreak for iOS 6. The reason is that iOS 6 introduced new security mechanisms and fixed the exploits that made the jailbreak possible on iOS 5.  You will have to wait.

There are no *public untethered* jailbreaks for any devices on iOS 6 for now. However, the A4 devices are tethered (have to jailbreak again on each boot) for life, and the iPhone 3GS old bootrom is untethered (a "normal" jailbreak) for life. <comment89755> Thanks for the info.
