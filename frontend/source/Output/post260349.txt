Searching other Mac's on Network for particular folder? <body> Admittedly not much of a programmer beyond the basics - made some simple little scripts to automate some mundane tasks and skip some unnecessary stuff but I'm a little out of my league with a particular concept.  Would there be any way with Applescript to search other Mac's on the same network for folders? Looking specifically for a program wherein one could input a job number and then it would check through a list of Macs to find out which one has the job. The first part could easily be done with a dialog, it's more-so the searching part that's going over my head.  Any help or insight would be appreciated. I tried using mdfind earlier but I must not have been using the correct address for the other Mac as it wasn't turning up anything. Once again, apologies for being clueless.
