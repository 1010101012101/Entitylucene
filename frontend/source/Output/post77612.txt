How secure are password protected PDFs that are created with Preview? <body> I use strong1Password/strongsup1/sup to store not only my own information, but also my sisters home Wi-Fi information.  Since she does not have a 1Password licence, I printed out the information for her to store in a safe place. Now, I was just thinking of using the printing dialog (under "Security Options...") to create a "password protected" PDF.  strongBut what does that actually mean and how secure is it?/strong   ul liDoes this encrypt the whole PDF?/li liWhat encryption is used?/li liIs it compatible with Windows and Ubuntu? /li /ul  There does notsup2/sup seem to be a knowledge-base article on support.apple.com. The info dialog in Finder merely says that the PDF is "Password Encrypted".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zVt6l.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer77613> The last Time I checked a 128 bit RC4 encryption of the whole document was used. Also, compatability should be vested.  Here's a screenshot of the output of GuaPDF: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQKnD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer77638> Another method, guaranteeing 256-bit AES encryption, is to use Disk Utility to create an encrypted disk image of a folder containing the PDF, or just a text file for that matter. One cannot create a disk image of a file - it must be a folder.  Steps:  ol liCreate a folder, place file(s) to encrypt within/li liOpen Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app/li liMenu item File  New  Disk Image from Folder/li liChoose folder to encrypt/li liClick the Image button/li liSelect .dmg save location, read-only and 256-bit AES Encryption:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m9p8f.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liClick the Save button, then enter a password of your choosing or use the 'Password Assistant' which can generate a password for you of several types and lengths. You are also able to store this password in your Keychain./li /ol  Naturally, the encrypted .dmg file can only be opened on a Macintosh.  This technique is handy for encrypting anything that can be put in a folder.  <comment89941> The download on the GuaPDF website [was reported by Sophos AV to contain a virus "Slenfbot-E"](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/7643395#7643395). Hence, I removed your link and cannot verify that 128-bit RC4 encryption is used. Do you mind creating a password protected PDF in Preview and checking it for yourself? <comment89961> So here's a screenshot. I encrypted the PDF with checking all check boxes in the Security Options. You have to decide if you trust the output of this application. <comment89963> Thanks for the update! I would always prefer first hand documentation by Apple about their software, but I'm willing trust this vendor for now ;) <comment90010> Thanks, I'm already aware of this nice and simple to use tool in Disk Utility. But I really want to secure the PDFs themselves because I cannot control if my sister's lax security practices will make her to simply copy the PDF from the encrypted disk image to somewhere else. <comment310961> Just an update regarding current versions of Preview.app here in 2016. The version of Preview.app that comes with Mac OS X 10.11.6 still encrypts PDFs with 128 bit RC4 encryption.
