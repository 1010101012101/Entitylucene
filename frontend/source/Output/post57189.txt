Thunderbird not accepting Apple RSS feeds <body> I'm trying to subscribe to an Apple RSS feed. brbrThunderbird keeps telling me that Apple RSS feed URLs are invalid. brbrFor example, I can't subscribe to feed://images.apple.com/main/rss/hotnews/hotnews.rss brbrCan I fix this problem, or is it just a problem with Apple's feeds?  <answer57193> Try using http://images.apple.com/main/rss/hotnews/hotnews.rss instead of feed://images.apple.com/main/rss/hotnews/hotnews.rss.  <comment65664> Thanks, that does work. I thought I had tried that already, but I guess not! Thank you
