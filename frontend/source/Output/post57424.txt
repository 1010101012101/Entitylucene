Hide unused icons from Dock <body> I just installed Mountain Lion, and I notice that the icons for Launchpad, App Store, To-Dos and Notes cannot be removed from my Dock â€” if I try to drag them off my Dock, they float back in.  Is there a way to hide or remove these icons?  <answer57426> I just noticed that if I right-click on these icons, there is a "Remove from Dock" hidden in the Options sub-menu in the context menu.  <answer57431> I have not tried it myself, but I read in a review that they intentionally made it harder to accidentally remove icons from the Dock.  Trying dragging the icon a good distance away from the dock and holding it there for a couple seconds, it should show you some kind of "about to poof this" indicator, and then drop it.  At least, that's what I got from the review I read.  <comment65973> I've done it. This works.
