Excel Mac 2011 - Cannot disable data connection after deleting tab <body> I have initiated a data connection (Data  Get External Data  Run Saved Query...  MSN MoneyCentral Currencies), but it was very slow, so I decided to delete the extra sheet that was automatically created for the data connection unaware of the fact that this would not get rid of the data connection itself. Since then, every time I open my workbook I get the...     Security Warning - Data connections have been disabled   ...message on top.  How can I disable this data connection? I'm happy to disable all data connections in this workbook, if that's easier, I don't need any.  Note: I have searched the net but most of the help threads and articles are about the PC version of excel.
