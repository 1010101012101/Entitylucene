No Apple icon/menu in menubar <body> One of our Macs is still on Mac OS X 10.6.8 and on that particular Mac, every so often, there is no Apple icon. When this happens, there is no Apple menu either. What I mean is that clicking where the Apple icon should be results in nothing - no menu options at all.  Sadly, this behavior is unpredictable. It can occur immediately after booting up, or it can occur after days of heavy use. We haven't noticed any pattern whatsoever. :(  We have tried resetting the NVRAM and SMC, starting in Safe Mode, quitting the Finder, verifying/repairing permissions, and scanning for viruses.  None of these steps have fixed this problem. I do not recall seeing the Apple Menu disappear while in Safe Mode, but since this issue is not constant it could just be that the Mac hasn't been used in Safe Mode for long enough to occur.  MY QUESTIONS:  ul liHas anyone ever anywhere seen this behavior before? /li liAny suggestions beyond having to do a full clean install? /li /ul  <comment352652> Please try to create an additional user account and check if the Apple menu is visible or not. <comment352786> I _think_ I've seen this before but gosh, it was a long time ago, maybe during the PowerPC era. If so, it's even possible it was pre Mac OS X. My first thought was the same as @oa- i.e. create another user account. I would do this and conduct 2 tests: (1) Log into both user accounts but then use your first account as normal (while the second one is logged in). Then, when it next happens, switch over to the new user account to see if the problem persists. (2) Only log into the first user account and when it next happens, also log into the new user account to see if the problem is replicated. <comment352938> Thank you for your help. The Mac already has 5 user accounts, and we've definitely noticed it on at least two of those. Do you think I should still create a new one from scratch or is that no necessary now? <comment353027> @oa- Please see my comment above. <comment353028> @Monomeeth Please see my comment above. <comment353029> Since your asking for ways to resolve this without doing a fresh installation, it's still worth doing as a test. Otherwise my instinct is to do a full backup/reformat/reinstall process. <comment353031> @monomeeth ok thanks
