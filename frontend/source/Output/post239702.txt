Terminal command to clear DNS cache doesn't seem to work <body> I do a lot of website work where I change nameservers for a domain, wait overnight for it to propagate on the host server, then go back to work on the site. Lately, what happens is that I can see the new site at the new location on my iPhone but not on my Mac (OS X 10.11.5), using any browser (Safari, FF, Chrome).  This suggests I need to clear my DNS cache. I've tried two different Terminal commands for 10.11+:  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder #(from Apple Support) /code/pre  or  precodesudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre  Then I restart OS X, empty browser caches, clear cookies. Nothing helps to get me to the new location, in any browser. But I can see it from my iPhone! This is maddening. Anybody know what I can do to get my Mac to recognize the new IP address for that nameserver?   <comment294293> Can you issue the command:  `system_profiler SPNetworkDataType | grep -i dns -A7` and paste the results.  You can append `| pbcopy` to the end of the statement to send it to your clipboard <comment294335> DNS:           Domain Name: PK5001Z           Server Addresses: 192.168.0.1, 205.171.2.26       DHCP Server Responses:           Domain Name: PK5001Z           Domain Name Servers: 192.168.0.1,205.171.2.26           Lease Duration (seconds): 0           DHCP Message Type: 0x05 <comment294336> I forgot to ask... is your iPhone connected to WiFi or are you going off your cell data network?  Your DNS appears to have you router as it's primary DNS. I will bet it's caching DNS records and hasn't updated.  Try resetting your router. <comment294457> My iPhone is connected to WiFi and the same router, but I like your suggestion and will try that.  Is there a configuration that would prevent this from happening? Thanks so much!
