In the OS X Contacts app (v7.1) how can I delete a group? <body> I've accidentally created a group in the Contacts app, below 'All Contacts'. How do I delete it?  If I remove the group name it renames itself to 'untitled group'. Here's a screenshot of what I see: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GgxP.jpg" alt="Contacts Screenshot"  <answer75216> ul liSelect the group/li liClick "Edit" in the menubar/li liClick "Delete Group"/li liClick Delete/li /ul  <answer115089> I just figured out all I needed to do on my MacBook Pro was highlight the contact, press kbdDelete/kbd and kbdEnter/kbd and the contact I was trying to get rid of was gone.  <comment87371> Unbelievable... I'm so stupid (and it shows how much I expect context-sensitive menus on everything). Thanks!
