Include original picture's file on a iPhoto slideshow <body> There is a simple way to include the original picture's file of a codeiPhoto/code slideshow? I create a slideshow with codeiPhoto/code, select codeShare/code and codeiDvd/code. Now I have the slideshow on codeiDvd/code and I can burn or export in codeVIDEO_TS/code or code.IMG./code What is the strongbest/strong way to have the burned dvd video with the original picture's file inside too?  <answer12921> In iDVD, in the Advanced Menu, there is an option to Edit DVD-ROM contents.  There you can simply add whatever content you want, including dragging in the photos from iPhoto.  <comment13717> Ok, tryed and works like a charm! <comment13718> glad it worked out out :)
