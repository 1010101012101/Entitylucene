AppleScript to automatically update IP-adress in Remote Desktop (ARD) on computers with DDNS <body> I've been searching for hours but couldn't find an answer yet hence my question here.  I frequently use Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) and I have setup a DDNS for every computer. The only problem I have with ARD is that the IP-address remains the same from the last session, so I have to manually select the computer in the list, and select "Get Info" in the context menu. There, I have to click on "Edit", delete the IP-address and click on "Done". That updates the computer to the current IP-adress because of the DDNS.  I have little to no experience in Automator or AppleScript and would love to automate that task for the 6 computers in the list on startup of ARD. All six remotes use dynamic DNS service so I should be able to resolve them by host name.  Is there a way to do this?  Here is my applescript so far, but no clue if I'm on the right track:  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Remote Desktop" set frontmost to true delay 1  tell window "Remote Desktop"      -- trying to select one computer after another here &gt; right click &gt; Get Info &gt; left click on Edit &gt; clear Address field &gt; click Done &gt; close window               end tell end tell /code/pre  PS: I have XCode and Accessibility Inspector installed, but had no clue on how to select a specific computer in the list and perform the tasks noted in the comment section of the script above.  strongEDIT #1: Six computers, all remotely, using dyndns.org for the DDNS./strong  <comment268798> A few questions to clear things up. How many computers? Are they on a local network or remote? And which DDNS did you set up?
