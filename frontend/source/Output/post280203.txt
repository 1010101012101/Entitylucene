Install old version of Homebrew on Snow Leopard <body> So I have a computer that is stuck on Snow Leopard.  How do I install Homebrew on such a old computer? Is this even possible?  I tried the following command:  precode/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  However this gives me an error about needing git and I don't know how to install an old version of that.  <answer280300> The current way to install Homebrew in Snow Leopard is to use the following command:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  After running this ensure you follow it up with:  precodebrew update --force /code/pre  Let me know how you go.  <comment352402> I'm guessing you've tried to install brew on Snow Leopard? If so, what have you tried? Do you get any error messages? <comment352453> @Monomeeth yes is throws an error saying I need git.  I do not know how to install an old version of git. <comment352572> Thanks for that, but can I ask you add to the question the actual Terminal command you tried using? This helps ensure that I (or others) don't suggest what you've already tried. :) <comment352573> @Monomeeth included the command I'm not sitting at the computer currently but it says I need git <comment352578> I've added an answer. Very similar to what you tried but without the `/usr/bin/` preceding it. I've just tested it on a Late-2008 MBP running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and it installs fine (remembering to follow it up with the second command).
