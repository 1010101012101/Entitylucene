Kernel panic on macOS with unusual message <body> My Mac just kernel panicked about 10 minutes ago. I have codeboot-args -v/code, and what happened was this:  ol liI was using my Mac as normal./li liSuddenly, I see the text that normally appears when I boot up appear in the top left corner of the screen (this occurred after trying to boot my Windows VM)./li liI find this odd and remove my hands from my Mac keyboard and mouse./li liIn a few seconds, I see a black-bluish screen with a box made of asterisks saying something along the lines of your computer was restarted because of a system problem, blah blah./li liThen my computer proceeds to reboot as it normally would, and I get the "Your computer was restarted because of a problem" message strongafter/strong my desktop appears, not during the logging in spinny wheel thing./li /ol  I have had one kernel panic before, and it looked like this. The way it looked this time was weird, and the font was large and in (I think) a font resembling Comic Sans.  Is something wrong with my laptop (not because of the panic, but because of the message)?
