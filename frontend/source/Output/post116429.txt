Using bash/terminal to get number of battery recharge cycles <body> I would like to get the number of recharge cycles using bash (terminal commands). I understand the following command will display all of the battery data, but I want the cycle count on its own  precodeioreg -l -w0 |grep Capacity /code/pre  I use the following command to get the battery percentage, so I imagine it can be modified slightly to get the cycle count instead;  precodeioreg -l | awk '$3~/Capacity/{c[$3]=$5}END{OFMT="%.3f";max=c["\"MaxCapacity\""];print(max&gt;0?100*c["\"CurrentCapacity\""]/max:"?")}' /code/pre  I'm new to bash, so I'm not completely sure how that code works, or how I'd adapt it for my needs.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.  <answer116435> Something like   codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "Cycle Count" | awk '{print $3}'/code  should do the job.   <comment136189> Thank you for your help. That works perfectly :) <comment341217> How about battery condition?
