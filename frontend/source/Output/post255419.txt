SSH No Longer Working After Sierra Update <body> I'm trying to ssh into a remote server using the format:   precodeuser@ip -i ~/.ssh/path/to/key  /code/pre  and I get the following error:  precode/etc/ssh/ssh_config: line 55: Bad configuration option: gssapikeyexchange /etc/ssh/ssh_config: line 56: Bad configuration option: gssapitrustdns /etc/ssh/ssh_config: terminating, 2 bad configuration options /code/pre  Connecting to a server without an SSH key doesn't work either.  Thanks.  <answer255435> Comment out or remove the lines  precodegssapikeyexchange no gssapitrustdns no /code/pre  from your code/etc/ssh/ssh_config/code and you should be good.  <answer269617> If you need to use Kerberos (and hence the codegssapi*/code options) a viable option is to copy an codessh/code executable from an older Mac (any version &lt;= OpenSSH_6.7) should work.  precodecp my-older-ssh /usr/local/bin/ssh /code/pre  <comment318081> What do the relevant lines look like in your ssh_config? <comment318085> @dr.nixon     GSSAPIKeyExchange no     GSSAPITrustDNS no <comment319733> What are the consequences? <comment319736> Since the new version does not support these options, the only consequence is that it will start to work. Otherwise you will not be able to @MaxRied use kerberos key exchange, which the OP was most probably not using.
