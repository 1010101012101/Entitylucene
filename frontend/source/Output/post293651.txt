After updating to iOS 10.3 instead of ringing all incoming calls get a busy signal <body> Just updated to iOS 10.3 and now all incoming calls get busy signal without roll over to voice mail. I turned phone off hoping this would reset it bit no luck. So I pushed down on home and power button till apple image came on and that did not help either. Anyone have any thing else in mind for me to try?
