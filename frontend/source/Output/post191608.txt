Copy a folder(and its internal structure), but only include specific files <body> I have a folder(with subfolders and further subfolders) that the final folder has many different file types. These file types include images(.png/.jpeg), videos(.mov), and text files(.txt). But I would like to copy the entire folder(with the internal structure) and only include .mp3's. Does anyone have any ideas how do do this. (please do not say manually because there are 100+ folders and the folder itself is 60GB, so don't tell me to copy the whole folder) Preferably, I would like if someone was able to give me a solution where I can outright move the .mp3's(while preserving the folder structure)  <answer191619> Without going to a somewhat complex command line script, I think copying the entire folder, and then searching for and deleting the files you don't want (easy through the Finder's search), would be the easiest way. Let me know if you want details (or, if copying the whole folder would indeed be anathema).  <answer191620> The following two commands, used in a Terminal, can accomplish what you've asked, the first creating a emdestination hierarchical directory structure/em containing the em*.mp3/em files and the second command deleting the em*.mp3/em files from the emsource hierarchical directory structure/em.  Note: Make sure you have proper backups before using the second command as a mistype can be fatal.  Open Terminal.  By default Terminal opens to one's emHome Directory/em so I'll use it as the example starting point and the emMusic directory/em as the emsource hierarchical directory structure/em.  This first command will make a copy of the emMusic hierarchical directory structure/em containing only em*.mp3/em files in the emdestination directory/em.  In other words after the first command is run there will be a emdestination directory/em containing that same emhierarchical directory structure/em starting at emMusic/em within the emdestination directory/em that contains only em*.mp3/em files and only the emdirectories/em from the emsource/em that contain em*.mp3/em files.  If a given emsource directory/em does not contain a em*.mp3/em file then that emdirectory/em is not created in the emdestination directory hierarchical structure/em.  Note: Full command line extends out of view without horizontal scrolling.  precodefind ./Music -name "*.mp3" -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR "{}" "./mp3 files only/" /code/pre  Note: Full command shown on two lines for clarity:  precodefind ./Music -name "*.mp3" -type f -print0 | \ xargs -0 -I '{}' /usr/bin/rsync -avR "{}" "./mp3 files only/" /code/pre  When the above command finishes there will be a emdirectory/em in my emHome Directory/em named em"mp3 files only"/em and within that emdirectory/em there will be a emMusic hierarchical directory structure/em containing only em*.mp3/em files.  Note: If the emdestination directory/em does not exist it will automatically be created.  Now that the em*.mp3/em files have been copied from the emsource Music hierarchical directory structure/em to the em"mp3 files only" directory/em the  em*.mp3/em files can be removed from the emsource Music hierarchical directory structure/em with the following command.  precodefind  ./Music/ -name "*.mp3" -delete /code/pre  That's it, the em*.mp3/em files along with their emhierarchical directory structure/em  have been copied to a new location and the em*.mp3/em files deleted from the emsource/em.  <comment227559> Thank you so much. This worked like a charm. I was stuck on this for a really long time. Thank you again for not making me copy the entire folder. :) <comment227560> I was just wondering: By changing the *.mp3 to, lets say *.txt, it would work for .txt files as well? <comment227562> Yes _*._ with remove files of whatever type  _*._ is, e.g. _*.txt_ will remove text files, _*.pdf_ will remove portable document format files, etc. <comment227563> Ok, thanks again <comment330405> I love you so much.
