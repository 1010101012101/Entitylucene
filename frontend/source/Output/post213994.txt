How fix broken Macports installation after manual deletion of app? <body> I had GIMP installed via codesudo port install gimp/code. This created the codeGIMP.app/code in code/Applications/MacPorts//code. I accidentally deleted it manually (or with AppCleaner, not sure), so every time Macports scans installed binaries, it warns  precodeWarning: Error parsing file /Applications/MacPorts/GIMP.app/Contents/MacOS/GIMP: Error opening or reading file /code/pre  This is also what happens when I try to install again. I uninstalled and cleaned the port, but installing again does not work; the code.app/code is not created and the above warning shows. How do I fix it?  <answer214488> MacPorts has a force option that allows you to continue, even in the case of errors.  I'd force-remove and then install it again.  <answer229676> I am not quite sure, but after I purged the unused dependencies of codegimp/code, the error went away.  <comment259031> To force what? Without `-f` the install completes, it is just that nothing happens. <comment259062> I meant, force uninstall <comment259076> I tried, to no avail. <comment259232> So force removing and then installing it doesn't do anything? Whats in the macports log? <comment259281> I ran `port -f uninstall gimp` and `port install gimp` again, and no change. The log says `...---  Scanning binaries for linking errors Warning: Error parsing file /Applications/MacPorts/GIMP.app/Contents/MacOS/GIMP: Error opening or reading file ---  No broken files found.`, so just the usual, except the warning. The `GIMP.app` is not created. There is a binary in `/opt/local/bin/gimp`, but running it does nothing. Previously, MacPorts also created the `.app` and judging from the warning it still tries to. <comment259354> To clarify: you ran both commands as root? <comment259365> Yes of course. Otherwise nothing would work. <comment259406> Let me check on my installation and I'll get back to you. <comment259444> Installing gimp on a clean system works fine here, so it's in your MacPorts. Let's try some things: sudo port clean all; sudo port selfupdate; sudo port upgrade outdated; sudo port uninstall gimp; sudo port install gimp
