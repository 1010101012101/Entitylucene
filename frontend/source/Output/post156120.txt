AppleHighlightColor syntax <body> I'm changing my highlight color via a command I find in Mathias Bynen's dotfiles like so:   precodedefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleHighlightColor -string "0.764700 0.976500 0.568600" /code/pre  I'd like to change it to something other than green, but I don't understand the syntax that is used for the color configuration (i'm a web developer so anything behind hex or rgba is dark magic to me).   First, what is the color specification?  Second, is there any documentation behind codeAppleHighlightColor/code?  <answer156134> The string is RGB with each value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 (i.e. 1 being 100%, 0 being 0%).  codeAppleHighlightColor/code is an undocumented setting as far as I can tell.  <answer164905> To get the values for AppleHighlightColor try the following:  ol liPick your desired color/li liGet that color's RGB values/li liTake each value and divide it by 255/li liPut them into the string in order R G B/li /ol  So, the color:  ul liRed: 255 = 255/255 = 1/li liGreen: 152 = 152/255 = 0.5960784314/li liBlue: 89 = 89/255 = 0.3490196078/li /ul  would end up as:  codedefaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleHighlightColor -string "1 0.5960784314 0.3490196078"/code  Be careful, it's the hightlight color only so you don't want to pick something dark as some (all?) apps don't change the highlighted text color - dark highlight color + black text = hard to read.
