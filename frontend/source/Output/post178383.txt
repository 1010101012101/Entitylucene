How do I set the default search for Finder to filenames which INCLUDE the search term (rather than just begin with it)? Yosemite <body> I'm using Yosemite (OS X 10.10.1).  If I search for the term "foo" and want a list of all files that include that term, I get foo.doc and bar.foo.doc and foodstuffs.xlsx and even The Foo History.  But it does not include snafoos.docx and AllTheFooReports.xlsx.  How can I change it to the (obvious!?!) behaviour of returning all results which include the search term?    I'd like to be able to do this from within Finder, not just in terminal.  <answer178438> If you are stuck you could use a find command in a terminal window.  Open a terminal window and type :$ codefind . -iname \*foo\*/code  Here's an example using the files you mentioned in your question.  precodemgagnon-mbp:tmp mgagnon$ ls AllTheFooReports.xlsx   bar.foo.doc     foo.doc         foodstuffs.xlsx     snafoos.docx  mgagnon-mbp:tmp mgagnon$ find . -iname \*foo\* ./AllTheFooReports.xlsx ./bar.foo.doc ./foo.doc ./foodstuffs.xlsx ./snafoos.docx /code/pre  If you're not familiar with the terminal this is a fun way to learn! :) The easiest way to open a terminal windows is using a spotlight search (command-spacebar) and search for terminal.  Hope this helps.  <answer178603> The Finder searches for word prefixes.  If you save your search as a Smart Folder and then inspect that using a text editor (e.g. TextMate) you will see the raw Spotlight query:  precode((kMDItemDisplayName = "foo*"cdw)) /code/pre  The "w" modifier tells Spotlight to search for words. The "*" wildcard at the end of the search string makes Spotlight search for word prefixes. It will match names that contain a word beginning with "foo".  That matches all of your examples but one. "foo" comes at the start of the file name, after a space or punctuation or is capitalized. The exception is "snafoos" where "foo" is just a sequence of letters in the middle of the word.  You could change the query in the smart folder to:  precode((kMDItemDisplayName = "*foo*"cd)) /code/pre  Or click the "+" button below the search field in Finder and add a "name" "contains" "foo" criterion.  Or use mdfind in Terminal:  precodemdfind -onlyin . '((kMDItemDisplayName = "*foo*"cd))' /code/pre  Or use HoudahSpot (of which I am the developer) to get more control over your search.  <comment211289> I'm seeing e.g. barfoo.txt in a simple Finder search from the top toolbar - pretty sure it's always done that <comment211296> Thanks @Tetsujin. Perhaps it's a setting that has gone astray for me.  But I am NOT getting internal text strings, unless they are separated by _ or . or spaces. <comment211297> hmm… I'm really not sure - maybe clear search prefs. Google seems to think that clearing Finder prefs would do it, but I'm not certain - this has instructions… http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/finder.html <comment211584> Thanks @Michael Gagnon, that's good to know.  I'm an old Unix user so can do all right in terminal, but was looking for a way to do this within the OSX GUI.  I have never broken the habit of my Unix style filenames, which never had a spaces and silly punctuation that didn't serve a specific purpose!  Good reminder that in a bind, this approach would work though. <comment211587> Thanks @Pierre.  Still baffled that Finder operates this way!  Your mention of  using the +  in an existing search to specify "name" "contains" does what I need.  Ideally I'd still like to make this the default search behaviour!  Does HoudahSpot allow for that?  I've heard good things about it before - I'll be checking it out! <comment211605> @KathyO HoudahSpot lets you save the current configuration (criteria, search locations, columns, sort order, …) "as default": New searches will open to that setup. It also lets you save templates for recurring searches. <comment211825> I'll try it!  Thanks. <comment257198> @PierreBernard do you have a source for the behaviour of the "w" modifier by any chance? I can't find any mention of it here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/SpotlightQuery/Concepts/QueryFormat.html <comment257329> @JoeTaylor Can't find any documentation. I may have inferred this from queries created by the Finder.
