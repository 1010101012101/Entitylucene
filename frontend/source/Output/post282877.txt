Can you see notification messages again once you tapped on the messages? <body> If you use messaging services like WeChat, you get messages notification when you receive it. Then if you tap on them, it would get you to the app where the received message is on the top screen page.  However, I would like to see messages on the notification center again that I already tapped on. This is because sometimes my friends in WeChat retract or delete the messages, and once I land on the app, I can't see what they write in their messages.  But as long as the messages are still in the notification center, I can read it. Is it possible to see these messages again in iPhone (iOS 10)?  <answer282932> Once a notification is removed from Notification Center, it is no longer available. Notifications are not stored historically elsewhere.
