My CPU is running slow after a system restore (4x0.8 GHz). Turbo Boost is definitely not working. And how can I fix it? <body> Last weekend, my Macbok Air suffered a heart attack and I ended up doing several hard shutdowns due to an unresponsive system. In the end I had to do a full system restoration.  Everything is working fine now except for one thing: The CPU is slow. Much slower.  CPU related computing is much slower than before, even though I can't tell for sure how much exactly. When running Ubuntu, I monitor the clock speed and see that all four cores are running constantly at 0.8 GHz. The same is true for OS X when using the Intel Power Gadget. It used to be 1.8GHz to 2.6GHz.

What should I do then?/strong  I guess you see that a hidden assumption is that the firmware is corrupted. This is why I tried to reinstall the latest firmware for my Mac from https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1237. But when I install that file I get the error: "This software is not supported on your system." Most probably because the latest firmware version is already installed.  <answer98817> Using the Intel power gadget (above) shows your CPU running at low speed.  In normal case that would be fine if there is no load.  I have MBA with 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 and runs at 0.85 at normal use, how ever it does spikes to 1.8 + under load.  Since the computer processing speed depends on more than one factor (CPU +SSD read/Write+RAM)...  I would say you (your mac) is a candidate for the Apple Hardware test.  strongUPDATE:/strong  If you have faulty battery (as reported by your hardware test based) then your Mac will automatically limit the CPU speed to about 1/2 (as designed by Apple.)  So fix the battery and you good to go.  <comment115973> There is a simple cpu monitor made by Intel. http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-power-gadget-20 <comment116093> @Buscarì›ƒ Wow, this is really nice. Thanks for link! <comment116102> You probably need an SMC reset: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US <comment116104> I have performed the extended Apple Hardware Test. It only reported about the faulty battery (which I new already). Everything else is fine. The CPU clock is constant no matter how I stress the CPU. <comment116107> @AlanShutko The SMC reset does not change anything. I have tried this multiple times already. <comment116110> Darn, it was the only thing I could think of.
