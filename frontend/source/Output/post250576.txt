How do you separate superimposed folders on desktop page? <body> I recently upgraded my macbook pro with OS X El capitan.  In the top Right hand corner of my desktop page I have 2 superimposed folders.  How do you separate them? I've tried dragging one folder to another part of the desktop page but it will not stay there.    <answer250580> Right-click on the Desktop. Go down to "Sort by" and change it to "none." That should allow you to move the files wherever you want.   <comment311236> If you right-click the Desktop, can you change the "Sort by" to none? <comment311237> That worked. Thanks heaps! <comment311238> I will post that as an answer, then!
