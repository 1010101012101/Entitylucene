Why is youtube on safari eating up all my RAM? <body> Please refer this youtube video to see the issue : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRbyrpqcI3o  As it can be seen in the video , as soon as I change the tab the RAM usage reduces to more than half than what it was when I was on the tab with youtube opened. What could be causing this issue?   Also while scrolling on a tab with youtube the frames stuck a lot while on the other tab its smooth.  Is it a safari problem? Or system problem?  <comment306043> Videos take up a lot of memory and processing power. There's nothing to be done on your end as far as I know. <comment306476> But taking up almost 6 GB of RAM in 2-3 secs that is not a normal behavior right? <comment306480> I can't tell for sure since the dock's in the way, but it doesn't appear to be be taking more than 1.01 GB, which isn't necessarily abnormal. <comment306485> check the "memory used" section below in the video, you'll see a significant difference when I change tabs. <comment306486> Looking at the processes, no single one seems to be making up for the difference. <comment306489> Yep thats what I am confused about that at the process level there is nothing that makes up for the difference in memory used section, but that jump happens only when I use the tab with youtube.
