Mac Mail stopped displaying Exchange mail <body> Quite suddenly, Mac Mail has stopped displaying mail from my work account, which is MS Exchange. Nothing came in after 9:00 a.m. Tuesday. After deleting and restoring the account, the status bar suggested that messages would be fetched, emand even appeared to count and fetch them,/em but nothing ever showed.  Mac Calendar continues to get updates. This appears to be only the Mail program. Ideas about what happened and how to fix?  <comment371135> This is not an answer, but a full upgrade to Sierra appears to have fixed it. Given that my iPad had no problem all along, I suspect something got messed up in the Mail client.
