Can TextEdit save as plain text? <body> When I try to save a new file in TextEdit, I always get a popup saying I can't save with ".txt" at the end of the file name.  I want to save a plaintext file, but TextEdit insists on saving as .rtf instead. It also lists .doc, .odt, .html, and some others.  strongHow can I save a TextEdit document as plain text?/strong  <answer17435> The format menu has a toggle to switch things for you.  Pressing kbdshift/kbd + kbdcommand/kbd + kbdT/kbd will toggle the document to plain text mode. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jbo1Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also set the default format in the preference pane for the app.  <comment19024> Welcome to mac where the help menu often does :-) <comment19026> "Why doesn't" questions are unanswerable by everyone except Apple :-). I've edited your question to reflect your real goal. <comment19120> @Nathan: Yes, much improved!
