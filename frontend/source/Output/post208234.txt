Start brew-installed applications from terminal <body> I just set up homebrew on my new macbook and used the codebrew/code and codebrew cask/code commands to install some applications. I can now open the applications from the launchpad but not from the terminal.  I know it's not working because the applications have not been saved to one of the directories in my code$PATH/code variable, but none of the installation guides I have read for homebrew mention how you can set it up to put links to the binaries there. Some tutorials mention you should change the order of directories in your code/etc/paths/code file, but I already did that and my problem persists.  Can anyone help me out? :)  <answer208238> Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile:  precodeexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH /code/pre  This prepends /usr/local/bin to your existing $PATH.  <comment251179> ... settings apply on newly loaded terminal windows <comment251189> This did not solve my problem, unfortunately (I quit and restarted the terminal of course). Installing an app with `brew cask` puts the .app file into `/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/`, and a symlink is created at `~/Applications`. `usr/local/bin` doesn't contain any of the installed apps, though. <comment251197> Turns out this only applies to apps installed via `brew cask`. `brew`-installed apps are fine.
