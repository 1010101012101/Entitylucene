The OP was asking about iOS 6 & 7. <comment334043> @fsb good point. Keep in mind you can edit a post yourself and add "10" instead of asking me to do so. Is that really enough of a reason to give me down votes? <comment334045> I'm aware I can edit your answer, thanks.  If I do that then it prevents you from learning how you can improve your answers in the future; I'm trying to help you get more upvotes.  Also,  I didn't downvote your answer, I'm not the only person on the site right now. <comment334049> @fsb Makes sense, thanks. I guess I assumed I would be notified of an edit.
