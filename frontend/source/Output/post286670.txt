Cannot Update my app store <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LiR7h.png" alt="enter image description here"  Hi, Everytime I want to update my app store. This thing always pop-up. And I finish typing my password on the app store. It keep pop-up this image  <comment361734> Usually that means that either 1) your password is not correct or 2) an application that's being updated was downloaded with a different user ID/pwd combination.  Are you sure you're using the correct user ID/pwd? <comment361737> I second @fsb comment. I also notice it says iTunes Store sign-in rather than App-Store sign-in. Double check your iCloud account and iTunes are logged into the same Account?
