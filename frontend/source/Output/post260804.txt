if personal hotspot shows as available network, does that mean that phone is in range? <body> My iPad shows that the personal hotspot of my iPhone is available to connect to.  Does this mean that the iPhone is in range of the iPad? (I am looking for the phone, which i can't find - if it is in physical range, i will know to keep looking!)  <comment326545> Why not use Find my iPhone? - then you can a) see roughly where it is & b) have it sound a chime to track it down.
