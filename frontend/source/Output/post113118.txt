How to change WhatsApp notification & SMS tone for iOS 7? <body> Does anyone know how to change WhatsApp notification &amp; SMS tone for iOS 7 (on iPhone 5S)?  I would like to use a ringtone such as Chinese music uploaded from phone or apps instead of using the default tone for WhatsApp.  <answer113119> This is currently no way to change that notification sound. This feature would need to be enabled by the developers themselves. You can try requesting this feature by emailing them. Here's the link.  <answer114272> This feature has been added and can be found in Whatsapp - Settings - Notifications. SMS tone is in the same place as always, Settings - Sounds - Text tone.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCqjD.png" height="300" / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gdbH.png" height="300"/  <answer116803> I am afraid you are mistaken. The feature is blocked in the latest whatsapp version for IOS.                                                                                                                                      <answer116862> I've just done it on my wife's phone. Open whatsapp - the app, click the setting cog (bottom right), notifications, message notifications - new message..select your tone! No jail breaking, no fancy anything  <answer118615> Here you go, but unfortunately your phone has to be jailbroken.  And once you SSH into your phone via Putty or something similar its easy here is a complete tutorial http://mythreebytes.wordpress.com/   <comment136641> Could you expand your answer? How exactly does this solve the problem? <comment136684> It's still there for me, are you sure? <comment138384> Welcome to Ask Different!
