Is there a way to auto "put back" everything in Trash? <body> My wife saw the folder 'all documents' in Finder and decided to move it all to the trash.   Now we have over 9,000 files in the trash and I haven't been able to find a way to put back everything with one click.  For some reason it will only let me 'put back' one file at a time.  Is there any way to automate this?  <answer38203> you should be able to highlight every file or at least do it in incremental batches, copy them then re-paste them I believe. I just tried it and if you double click your trash can then right click the files you wish to restore there is a "put back" option which only works file by file, as said i would highlight then press C-c (command c)to copy then C-v(command v) to paste them back.  <answer38206> If "Put Back" is disabled for a multiple-item selection it means that (at least) one of the items selected doesn't have its original location information stored in the Trash directory's .DS_Store file.    Though it's less than ideal, try multi-selecting subsets of the files looking for groups that you can "Put Back" emen masse/em before resorting to manual filing for the remaining files.  <answer68528> Prior to Snow Leopard, OS X does not natively have the ability to restore files to their original locations that they were deleted from (as can be done natively in a Windows environment with the "Restore" option in the context menu for Recycle Bin). I accidentally did the same thing as your wife did at one point with around 10,000 plus files being deleted.  After exploring all my options I performed a system restore via Time Machine. It was by far the most expedient method to get said files to their proper locations.  <answer89060> This worked for me:  ul liCreate a new folder in Finder, I called mine "recovered files"/li liOpen Trash folder and select a group of files/li liCopy files and paste into "recovered files" folder./li /ul  If you need to put back a large folder, or a large number of individual files, use this technique.  If you need only 1 or 2 files, just use the "put back" feature.    <answer100990> Try running a script like this in AppleScript Editor:  precoderepeat     tell application "Finder"         close windows         if items of trash is {} then return         open trash         activate     end tell     tell application "System Events"         key code 125 -- down arrow         key code 51 using command down -- command-delete     end tell end repeat /code/pre  If Finder shows a password dialog when you try to put back some item, try adding something like this to the end of the codetell application "System Events"/code block:  precodedelay 1 if exists window 1 of process "SecurityAgent" then     tell window 1 of process "SecurityAgent"         set value of text field 2 of scroll area 1 of group 1 to "pa55word"         click button 2 of group 2     end tell end if delay 1 /code/pre  <answer115476> An AppleScript that "Put[s] back all items in the Trash" worked for me:  Open "AppleScript Editor" and copy/paste the lines below, then run the script as many times as needed.  precodetell application "System Events"     tell process "Finder"         repeat 100 times             tell application "Finder" to open trash             tell application "Finder" to activate             key code 126             key down command             key code 51             key up command             delay 0.2 -- adjust delay as needed         end repeat     end tell end tell tell application "Finder" to close every window /code/pre  <answer233869> Drag all files from Trash to All My Files tab in Finder. It will take a while if you have a lot of files. We tested on 10000+ files. Finder will restore all files to its original location.   <comment43280> If she dragged the folder into the trash, then just drag it back out? <comment79588> Well, as you can easily deduce from other answers here, it is possible to put back files/folders from Trash: open Trash, right-click a file and select "Put Back". <comment93291> I can't seem to "Put Back" files en masse. I can select either file and the option to put back is there but when I select both "Put Back" is not available. Thus I don't think you can "Put Back" en masse. Maybe with an applescript though... <comment184190> This answer is incorrect.  I'm in a state where any individual file can be "Put Back" but if I select more than one file I cannot, which is inconsistent with your answer. <comment184192> Wrong - this again does not actually "put back" the files and does not solve the issue, it merely takes them all and throws them into one big pile. <comment328879> +1 for cool wife. <comment330283> This does nothing on macOS Sierra <comment332933> This worked for me on macOS Sierra. FYI: key code 126 is up and key code 51 is backspace. You can modify the 3 lines key down ... key up ... to one: `key code 51 using key command down`. (This is adapted from another answer. Files restored to my desktop wanted my system password, which messed with this script.  I cancelled those and manually restored those few.
