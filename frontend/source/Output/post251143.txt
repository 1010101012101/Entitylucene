Where did my Finder Filter go? <body> Normally I'm able to filter my search by file size as shown in this tutorial. However, for some reason this morning I can't find the filter anymore, where did it go?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xyJtp.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gb61s.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is what I'm expecting to see: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/88q1w.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thanks :)  Edit: See the end of Tetsujin answer. Essentially the Filter won't show up when searching from "All My Files", which is at minimum, not a sensible design decision because launching Finder takes one to "All My Files" by default   So if that bothers you, it's possible to change this senseless default  Just go into preferences and change to a different "New Finder window" and then codecmd+F/code will behave as expected   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xmnCZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer251146> That's not a search window, that's just a regular Finder window.  Hit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd F /kbd (which will open a new Search window), or start typing something in the Search box, top right, &amp; your filters will appear.  If you still don't see it, click the strong+/strong top right - highlighted in green below...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DT3wh.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also use it to add more filter criteria...br (Note that "no query should be required" only applies if you start from kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd F /kbd not from a regular Finder window, as your first example.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLv6n.png" alt="enter image description here"  emLate discovery/embr It doesn't work if you start from "All My Files"br I have no idea why.  <comment312095> thanks for the response :) please see edits <comment312103> Edited to fit your situation <comment312104> ooohhh... Doesn't work if your start from "All My Files". Interesting. I've never used that option before... I **know** where my files are, I hate that 'hidden path' view.
