How to switch to other apps/spaces when running full-screen game <body> I did not noticed such problems with anything except some games. For example, i'm runnin Pillars Of Eternity atm, and if it's running fullscreen mode, i cannot switch to any other apps (i've tried alt-tab, cmd-tab, cmd-arrow, f11, custom spaces-switching shortcuts, touchpad gestures)  Also, in window mode, i can only switch using codealt-tab/code (switching between apps within the same space) if i have other apps running in the same space. Other shortcuts are working only if i'm clicking outside the game.  El Capitan 10.11.6  <answer274728> Have you tried using ctrl-arrow keys? This will move you between the left and right spaces.  A similar question is also here:  How to switch between fullscreen applications in OSX (Mavericks)  <comment345501> yes, i did. Sorry, forgot to mention that.
