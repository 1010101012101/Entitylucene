Is it safe to add yourself to group 82 (_clamav) <body> I want to have a similar group id on my host machine (macOS) and virtual machine (docker for mac) to avoid permissions problems. I wanted to create a new user/group with ID 82 but it's already exists â€“ _clamav:_clamav. As I understand it's some kind of antivirus engine. Is it safe to add myself to this group?  <answer275620> For your purposes, it's best not to add yourself to an existing group.  To discover what groups are on your computer you will find most listed in code/etc/group/code - codeless /etc/group/code will give it to you. You can create a new group by adding it to this list. codeman group/code will explain the format of this file. I usually create a group with an id from 600 to 699. Apple seems to use ids above 700 for special groups not listed in code/etc/group/code.  To discover what groups you are already a member of you can use the codegroups/code command. To list the ids of the groups you are a member of you can use the command codeid -G/code.  <comment346737> The thing is I need this group to have ID 82 because it's hardcoded in Alpine Linux which I use inside of my docker containers. Maybe I could change `_clamav` ID to something else and add a new user/group with ID 82 but it might not be safe. <comment346739> Are you running [clamAV](http://www.clamav.net) on your Mac? <comment346741> Well, I think this user/group comes with macOS out of the box, I do not have clamav installed. <comment346744> I too have uid 82 assigned to `_clamav` but am not running the software. Given that you are dealing with hard coded values in Alpine Linux, adding yourself is likely the easiest option.
