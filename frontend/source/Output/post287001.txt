How do I save tracks to sd card on Apple music? <body> Apple Music supports SD cards on Android. What about iPhone?  I have an iPhone with 16GB memory so I want to save the downloaded Apple Music to an SD card so I can run my apps normally.   Is there any method to do that?   <answer287002> As a matter of fact, if you want to save Apple Music songs to your SD card and play them freely, that's impossible, because Apple Music songs are protected by DRM, which prevents the Apple Music from being played on other devices or media players than a few authorized devices and media players. But if you can convert those Apple Music songs to other universally-compatible audio formats such as MP3, you can save the converted songs to your SD card and play them freely. You can use TuneFab Apple Music Converter to remove the DRM protection and convert Apple Music songs to MP3. if you are wondering how to make that happen, here is a tutorial.  http://www.tunefab.com/tutorials/apple-music-to-sd-card.html
