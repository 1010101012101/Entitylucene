How can I delete VMWare from my MacBook Air? <body> I installed VMware on my MacBook Air (running OS X Lion) and now want to delete it. I dragged VMware into the trash and tried emptying it, but a popup notes that codeThe operation can’t be completed because the item “VMware Fusion” is in use./code  I tried pressing kbdcommand/kbd + kbdoption/kbd + kbdesc/kbd but could not see VMware open. I am confused about how VMware is in use.   <answer42157> Try this:  ol liOpen Activity Monitor from code/Applications/Utilities/code and change the Show drop down from My Processes to All Processes. /li liSort by name and find any processes that have the name VMWare. /li liPress the Quit Process button and click Force Quit. /li /ol  For removing the app, I recommend AppZapper.  <answer42160> Here is how you remove VMWare Fusion as referenced here from VMWare: Manually uninstalling VMware Fusion     Fusion 4.x      In Fusion 4.x, there is no uninstaller. Most Fusion files are contained within the application bundle (that is, the Fusion application in /Applications). To uninstall Fusion 4.x, drag the application bundle from the Applications folder to the Trash.      Also, ensure to delete these additional files and folders if they are present.       Note: Depending on the environment, some of these files may not be present. Some files may exist only if Fusion 3 was originally installed on the machine that was later upgraded to Fusion 4.      /Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion   /Users/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion   /Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion   ~/Library/Caches/com.vmware.fusion   ~/Library/Application\ Support/VMware\ Fusion   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusion.LSSharedFileList.plist   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusion.LSSharedFileList.plist.lockfile   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusion.plist   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusion.plist.lockfile   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusionDaemon.plist   ~/Library/Preferences/com.vmware.fusionDaemon.plist.lockfile      Note: In Lion, the Library folder inside your user directory is hidden by default. To access your Library folder:       Click the Finder icon.   While holding the Option key, click the Go menu. This reveals your Library folder.   <answer243813> You can run the shell script below. The bash version of the script below will also serve the same purpose.  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash # Usage: sudo sh ./uninstall_vmware.sh remove() {   entry="$1"    echo -ne "Removing \e[1;34m$entry\e[0m...
