Open Finder and hit CMD+SHIFT+G. Check these Folders:  pre /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/LaunchAgents /pre  Delete the file you are looking for (App-Name / Company)br/ but be careful - do not delete any random file.  Restart your Mac. If it still popp up, it is hidden somewhere else. I don't know what you installed, maybe it needed admin priviliges and is therefore located in the System/Library/LaunchDaemons folder.  Other Folders that may contain your app/script.  pre /Library/StartupItems /System/Library/LaunchDaemons /System/Library/LaunchAgents /pre  You could also check the logs via the Console Application.  <comment150709> Which Application? <comment150710> Sorry I am also un shore of that! <comment150717> is there anything in `System Preferences  Users & Groups  *your user*  Login Items` that it could be? <comment150723> Use **Applications  Utilities  Activity Monitor.app** to list running applications; this will include those that are hidden from your Force Quit list. Knowing the name of the application will help get you a full answer. <comment150728> Thank you it was some type of keylogger... Naughty I know. <comment150729> see update in question <comment150730> none of these seem strange to me? <comment150738> indeed, maybe in the /Library/StartupItems. Also check the console for log output at boot. <comment150740> You may also want to check `~/Library/LaunchAgents`
