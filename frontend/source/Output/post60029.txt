How to create a disk image from the command line <body> Currently part of my build process is as follows;  ul liStart Utilities/Disk Utility /li liSelect New Image /li liSet Save As to widget/li liSet Name to widget /li liSet Size to custom size 50 mb /li liSet Format Mac OS Extended/li /ul  but is it possible to do all this from the command line ?  <answer60031> You can do this with the hdiutil tool. The appropriate configuration in your case would be:  precodehdiutil create -size 50m -fs HFS+ -volname Widget /path/to/save/widget.dmg /code/pre  Obviously change the "Widget" and path to whatever you need.  A few additional options that may be useful:  ul licode-srcfolder /path/to/source/code This will create the disk image with the data in the specified folder as the contents./li licode-megabytes 50/code used instead of code-size 50m/code. This will use binary sized megabytes (2^20 bytes) instead of decimal (10^6 bytes)./li licode-srcdevice /dev/diskXsY/code This  is like codesrcfolder/code, but makes a block-based copy from another device, like a hard drive partition or DVD. Useful for making clones and images of install disks, etc./li /ul
