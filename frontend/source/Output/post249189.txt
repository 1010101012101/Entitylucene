How to force-restart OS X networking? <body> There's a coffee shop network I connect to fairly often.  Usually it works fine, but sometimes it gets into a state where the connection repeatedly fails about thirty seconds after connecting.  Once it gets into this state, nothing I can find will allow the connection to stay up short of rebooting my laptop completely.  This is extremely annoying.  To be specific, when I open the Network Diagnostics panel, I get green status lights on Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Settings, and Network Settings, and red lights on ISP, Internet, and Server.  All of the below cause ISP/Internet/Server to briefly turn green, then fail again 15-30 seconds later.  If I'm quick, I emcan/em load a web page in the interval, so network connection is happening.  Things that don't work:  ul liTurn Wi-Fi Off/On from the menu bar/li licodesudo ifconfig en0 down/up/code/li likill mDNSResponder process/li liwaiting and hoping it will just fix itself/li /ul  Thing that does work:  ul liRebooting the computer/li /ul  What else can I try?  (I am running El Cap 10.11.3 on a retina MacBook Pro.)
