Shortcut to create/remove desktop in Mac OSX 10.8 <body> To switch desktops, one can use &lt; CTRL -i or &lt; CTRL -[&lt; left &lt; right ].  Are there shortcuts to create and remove desktops?  If not, how can I make them?  <answer189294> I would use Automator's watch me function to record the keys and mouse actions needed to add a new screen.  Barring that, you'd need to hack the plist and restart finder or get third party MouseTools to help with UI automation.
