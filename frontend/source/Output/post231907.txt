How do I use spell check in OSX with several languages? <body> I often need to write emails in French that contain English technical words and it seems that the spell check in OSX can't understand that a document can contain both languages.   The result is either French or English words are red-underlined and this isn't pretty.   I've tried the trick on How to make Firefox to spellcheck in multiple languages simultaneously? that consists in merging several .dic and .aff files downloaded from titoBouzout/Dictionaries but the grammar check is less precise than the default OSX one.   <answer231910> Try this:   ol liGo into strongSystem Preferences / Language and Region/strong and set French as emPrimary/em language under emPreferred languages/em./li liRestart the computer./li liSet back you previous primary language (by dragging it from the emPreferred languages/em list to the top)./li liRestart. /li /ol  I just tried this, and even after deleting French from my emPreferred languages/em it kept correctly correcting French words.  I'm not entirely sure why, but it seem to do the trick.  <answer231933> Go to system preferences/keyboard/text/spelling and click on the window and go to the Setup item.  Then check the boxes for only the two languages you want and set it to Automatic.  Also set the dictionary to Automatic in Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar.  I suspect this works better for separate sentences or paragraphs in different languages than for different languages in one sentence.
