Why doesn't my Terminal show 'last login' message? <body> Terminal.app on my mac used to show codeLast login: &lt;date time&gt; on ttys000/code as the first line. However, when I opened it this week, I noticed that it didn't show the message. Is this normal, or did I do something wrong?  I tried rebooting mac, and tried 'repair disk permissions' in Disk Utility, but neither of them fixed the problem. I found that code~/.hushlogin/code suppresses the message, but no such file was found when I tried codels -la ~/code.  I'm using OS X 10.8.5.  strongEdit:/strongbr I installed GPG Suite last weekend. Does it have something to do with the problem?  strongUpdate:/strongbr I think this problem is systemwide, because it is reproduced in Guest account. I suspect that the log file of last login may be corrupt. Is this possible? How can I check this?  strongUpdate 2:/strongbr I tried opening another window while running codesudo opensnoop -ve -n login/code. I found that codelogin/code failed in opening some files in code/var/log/asl//code and the 'errno values' were '24'.  strongUpdate 3:/strongbr I found that errno 24 meant 'too many open files', and tried reducing the log files by codesudo aslmanager/code. This fixed the problem! I don't know why these log files had remained undeleted though.  <answer119011> h2Check settings, ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile/h2  You may have inadvertently changed the following setting in your preferences, which can be accessed either from the menu:   strongTerminalPreferences.../strong  or by pressing the kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbd,/kbd keys.  The setting you are looking for is in the "shell" tab.  If the run command button is ticked under Startup, that may be your issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4mwJw.png" alt="enter image description here"  If that is not it I would the check the contents of the following files:  ~/.bashrc; and  ~/bash_profile  <answer119081> codelogin/code should display that message unless it is run with a '-q' option or the file '.hushlogin' exists.  It would be good to know the command line for login.  At the command prompt go codeps ax | grep login/code and you should get a line for each open Terminal window that reads something like this :  precodelogin -pf &lt;username&gt;  /code/pre  or   precodelogin -pfl &lt;username&gt; exec -la bash /bin/bash /code/pre  Check that out and see what it says.  codebash/code and it's profiles have nothing to do with displaying that message. The setting of the "Shell" preference also makes no difference as codelogin/code is run regardless of how this is set.  If login is  not being run with a -q option then something else is happening. If you try codetype -a login/code you should get nothing but codelogin is /usr/bin/login/code. I'd also triple check that code~/.hushlogin/code does not exist.  <comment138751> And trashing the Terminal preference file? <comment138776> ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist <comment138859> @AndrewU. I tried trashing the file, but it didn't fix the problem. <comment138863> Are you sure `ls -l ~/.hushlogin` shows nothing? <comment138864> something has definitely changed on your system, I have GPG suite installed as well - that should make no difference. I would check ~/.bash_aliases.  Also would try starting terminal from a newly created user and see if you get the old behaviour back? <comment138949> @lhf `ls -la ~/.hushlogin` returned `No such file or directory`.
