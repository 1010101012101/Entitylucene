Set the hostname/computer name for macOS <body> I have a local network at home. This network contains 5 laptops. One of the laptops is Apple laptop with macOS 10.8 on it. The other has a Linux installed, all other runs Windows.  When trying to open my router and check "Connected devices", under the IP address of this Mac I see following:  Host Name - some IPV6 address  What I'd rather prefer to see is some meaningful name so that I can use that in the /etc/hosts file in Linux laptop. And also I'd like to check the computer name so that the /etc/hosts line was proper.  <answer287774> You can set the computer name in System Preferences â†’ Sharing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dxfds.png" alt=""  <answer287775> Setting the Mac hostname or computer name from the terminal     ol   liOpen a terminal. /li   liType the following command to change the strongprimary hostname/strong of your Mac:br   This is your fully qualified hostname, for example myMac.domain.com   precodesudo scutil --set HostName &lt;new host name&gt; /code/pre/li   liType the following command to change the strongBonjour hostname/strong of your Mac:br   This is the name usable on the local network, for example myMac.local.   precodesudo scutil --set LocalHostName &lt;new host name&gt; /code/pre/li   liIf you also want to change the strongcomputer name/strong, type the following command:br   This is the user-friendly computer name you see in Finder, for example myMac.   precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName &lt;new name&gt; /code/pre/li   liFlush the DNS cache by typing:   precodedscacheutil -flushcache /code/pre/li   liRestart your Mac./li   /ol   <comment363397> after doing this I still see the IPv6 address in the router. Any idea? And what would be the line in the /etc/hosts file on Linux if I set the hostnames to MyMac? <comment363425> Always attribute quoted content with an appropriate source link and use quote formatting for quoted content. I've added a potential source link but please [edit] if this is incorrect. <comment363430> @ggarside, I still see an IPv6 as a computer name inside the router. It is a Comcast modem/router one. Any idea?
