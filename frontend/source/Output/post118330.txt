ntpd unable to create socket on en0 <body> I have a mac mini running OS X Server (Mavericks, 10.9.1 - latest Server.app) and I keep getting these error messages in them system logs every few minutes. I am not sure if there is a real problem or not.     Jan 22 08:20:54 myosxserver.com ntpd[???]: unable to create socket on   en0 (????) for ipv6here   Is there really something wrong? or can I disable ntpd from logging these?  <answer118642> I believe I corrected this by using this in the terminal:  precodesudo ntpdate -u time.euro.apple.com /code/pre  <answer125037> I fixed this issue by adding the following line to /etc/ntp.conf  precodeinterface ignore ipv6 /code/pre  and then restarting ntpd  <comment138090> did you change anything in the ntp.conf? Do you have ipv6 disabled on the ethernet interface? <comment138093> no I have not, and I just checked and it seems to have the europe apple server as expected (?) in one line as: server time.euro.apple.com. I believe the ipv6 is enabled on the ethernet as it has an ipv6 address when I look in the network pref. <comment138101> I take it ipv6here was the ipv6 address? did you replace something with (????)? What is the output of `sudo lsof -n -i UDP:123` <comment138398> ntpdate is now deprecated. If /etc/ntp.config contains "time.euro.apple.com" then `sudo ntpd -q` does the same thing and is the recommended alternative. <comment138405> Thanks, I had done that too, I guess this one must have done the trick.
