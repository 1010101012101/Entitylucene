How to disable vibration for Timer alerts? <body> In codeiOS Settings / Notifications/code, I can control whether alerts use vibration or sound or vibration-and-sound for Calendar, FaceTime, Mail, Messages, Phone, and Reminders apps.   In codeClock App / Alarm / Edit or Add Alarm / Sound/code, I control whether alarm-clock alerts use vibration or sound or vibration-and-sound.   But I can't seem to have timer alerts (from codeClock App / Timer/code) that are sound-only (no vibrate), without killing vibration for all apps.   Or am I mistaken?   <answer237251> You are not mistaken; a very odd oversight on the part of Apple. Note that you can turn off "Vibrate on Silent" in sound settings and flip the side switch put your phone on Silent, which will disable that vibration and still make the sound (I believe).   Also note that you can turn off vibration for alarms, but for some reason not for timers. My suggestion would be to download a different timer app from the app store if you want greater customizability.  <comment348473> Wrong - fortunately, when you turn off the idiotic vibration FOR ALARMS, indeed that also turns it off for TIMERS. <comment348474> It currently (Mar 2017) works that: within the clock app, if you turn off Vibration for "alarm" section, in fact it turns off vibration for "timer" section. Typical Apple screw-up.
