Can an HFS+ formatted drive be shared with Windows <body> I have a Mac Mini that I'm using as a media server. I just put together an external RAID enclosure and I'd like to format it as HFS+, primarily so I can use it for Time Machine backups. 75% of everything I do is with OS X or iOS, but I do have a Windows machine, and the majority of my friends and family use Windows. I'm not real clear on how network sharing protocols work. I know in order to share a volume with Windows (without installing some additional softare on windows) I have to set it up as an SMB share rather than AFP.  Will I be able to format the drive as HFS+ and create an SMB share for my Windows machines? Does the drive format matter in this case?  (The only reason I'm not just emtrying/em it is because the external drive is already formatted with an exFat partition and already has a fair amount of data on it. In order to reformat to HFS+ I would have to first sync all that data somewhere else, reformat, then sync it back - a task I'd rather not undertake if I won't be able to get the results I need.)  <answer230129> Attached to an OS X Server you can use the RAID-volume formatted to HFS+ or ExFAT to create shares for Windows clients.  After enabling the share it is accessible via AFP and SMB by default:   Example screenshot OS X Server 3.2.2 Mavericks:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1fJHn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Example screenshot OS X Server 5.0.15 El Capitan HFS+:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WGmzi.png" alt="enter image description here"  Example screenshot OS X Server 5.0.15 El Capitan ExFAT:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V8UKP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Both shares are accessible as usual (Data:HFS+ formatted/data2: ExFAT formatted):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0eV2l.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment280875> Great, thanks. One question - if I leave the volume formatted as ExFAT, can I still allocate Time Machine space using OSX Server? I am of the understanding that Time Machine ''required'' and HFS(+) formatted volume. <comment280876> @JordanBondo I have to test this. I'll report back. You can't use an ExFAT volume to backup your OS X server **locally**. <comment280883> @JordanBondo I haven't been able to use an ExFAT volume as shared Time Machine backup location. You would have to add a r/w sparse bundle.dmg, mount & share this and use it as an additional share for networked Time Machine backups <comment280888> That's what I thought. I'm doing that currently, but I've had TimeMachine flip out a couple different times when using a sparsebundle, so I'm trying to get away from that. I think I'll just reformat as HFS+ and create an SMB share for lame old Windows. I'll check all this out when I get home & accept your answer when I can confirm this all works for me. Thanks again!
