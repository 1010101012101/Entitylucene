Place screenshots on Desktop on Display 2 <body> How can I do to tell the system that every time that takes an screenshot place it on Desktop, but on Second Monitor?  It only must be placed on Display 1 when Display 2 won't be available.  <answer159535> I could never find a way to set this with a machine preference.  I ended up just creating a folder on my second monitor name strong"ScreenShots"/strong and setting the default location for screenshots to that folder.  They will then save to that desktop and into that folder.  strongChange the default location to new folder on external monitor:/strong      precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/ScreenShots/ /code/pre  strongRestart the SystemUIServer to make it take affect:/strong  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <comment187471> Sorry mate, I have a completely clean desktop and I don't want to create a folder for it.
