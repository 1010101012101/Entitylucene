Keeping dust out of iPhone camera <body> I have an iPhone 5s and and over time the camera has slowly built up little pieces of dust inside of it, which I'm sure degrades the photo quality. Now that I have a new iPhone 6s I want to completely prevent dust from getting inside of the camera lens.   Is there anything I can do to prevent dust from getting under the camera lens? Is there any way to get it out of my old phone and, if so, what is the procedure?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6un8.jpg" alt="camera"  <comment284058> Usually cases will stop dust from getting into the nooks and crannies of your phone. Not sure how dust got behind the camera lens, though. Strange. <comment284198> It had a case for most of its life
