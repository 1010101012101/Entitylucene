map arrow key to key + touchpad <body> I am trying to activate the arrow keys as follows: I want to touch the trackpad(say with one finger) and press 'w' instead of pressing the up arrow key. Does somebody know a nice way how to do this. I tried using BetterTouchTool together with Hammerspoon, but I have a couple of problems. I don't know how I can bring BTT to trigger when I just touch the trackpad and not tab it. Also I can't figure out how Hammerspoon can press a particular key.  I can't use Karabiner since I am using macOS Sierra. I would appreciate any Idea for a solution for doing this :)  <comment353034> Karabiner elements is your only hope I would imagine and it is not out really yet
