Partition of harddisk lost/unusable <body> I'm using OS X Yosemite - version 10.10.2. I have 1.12 TB fusion drive on my system. Recently I wanted to make a partition on my system, while making the partition on the system using disk utility some error occurred and partition was not created successfully.  The unusable partition of the disk.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/weV9w.png" alt="The unusable partition"   The partition is not available here either. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0tAiZ.png" alt="diskutil list"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3sdPK.png" alt="diskutil corestorage list"  So, here I'm not able to access the free space partition of my disk. The disk utility is not working with the free space partition. I want to resize the partition and want to have only single partition disk  <answer175979> You have to boot from another device or to Internet Recovery Mode and then use the command line to modify the CoreStorage volume.  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liBackup your data./li liDetach any external drive (especially your external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite)./li /ul  strongModify CoreStorage:/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utilities/Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code/li liEnter codediskutil cs resizeStack LVUUID size/code with LVUUID: UUID of the logical volume and size: the final size of your Macintosh HDbr Example:br codediskutil cs resizeStack C6AE5E40-1B4F-4AED-BD80-9E71EB6F1352 1000g/codebr to expand it to 1.0 TBbr codediskutil cs resizeStack C6AE5E40-1B4F-4AED-BD80-9E71EB6F1352 0g/code orbr codediskutil cs resizeStack C6AE5E40-1B4F-4AED-BD80-9E71EB6F1352 100%/codebr to expand it to the full size with magic numbers./li liEnter codeexit/code and quit Terminal./li liReboot to your main volume./li /ul
