Is it possible to use an iPhone device for storage? <body> I know that through iTunes you can store images, audio etc. on your iPhone. But is it possible to access the iPhone and store any kind of files for later retrieval, much like a memory stick?  <answer1806> Sure, take a look at the app Air Sharing. It makes a storage area accessible by WiFi via WebDAV, and also allows you to view the contents on the iPhone itself (for as far as there are built-in viewers).  Or you can jailbreak and store files directly in the iPhone's memory. Use SCP over WiFi, or connect the USB and use iPhoneBrowser.  <answer1807> There's an app called Phone Disk that seems to do exactly what you need. The one downside is that it needs to be installed on the host computer to work.
