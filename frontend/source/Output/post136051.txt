How do I restore new iphone settings? <body> I plugged my new iphone into my computer and it asked if I wanted to restore my old iphone settings.  I clicked yes not realizing I would lose everything from the last 8 months since I got the new phone.  Is there any way to restore what was on the new phone?  <answer136077> Open iTunes preferences, there's a "Devices" tab that shows you any backups stored on that computer, but if you've never connected it in between I can hardly imagine there's an older backup. Did you connect your phone to any computer in the last 8 months, or did you eventually use iCloud backups? You could check those as well..
