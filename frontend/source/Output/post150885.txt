How many displays can a Mac Mini 2014 drive <body> How many displays can a Mac Mini 2014 drive?  Given that the Mac Mini now has 2 thunderbolt + 1 HDMI video outputs, it would be able to drive 3 monitors right? It ofcourse depends on the resolutions. Not sure what that Intel Iris Graphics card can take.  <answer150893> http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hd-graphics/hd-graphics-developer.html  A section in the webpage listed above states:  "View movies or presentations in ultra-high definition on Ultra HDTV or 4K resolution displays. With Intel Iris and Intel HD graphics, you can even daisy-chain up to three displaysâ€”or use collage mode to combine displays into a single unified higher resolution for larger screen sizes."  Hope this helps!  <answer155100> I've tried it with 3 displays, but no go.  Any combination of 2 displays work, but not 3 at the same time.  <comment177643> Thanks!. Not sure why Apple says upto 2 displays - http://www.apple.com/mac-mini/specs/ . Maybe its that resolution. Its not really clear. <comment184288> Is it 100% confirmed that 3 displays is a no-go on the 2014 Mini when using 1 HDMI, and both Thunderbolt ports? <comment212103> I can confirm this.  Bought a top-of-the-spec i7, 16G mem, 2TB HD and any combination of 2 displays work, but not 3 at the same time.  Called Apple support and they just pointed me to the spec page where is says "supports up to 2 monitors".  Mentioned about Intel Iris spec supporting 3 and they said I should log a feature request on the their feedback page. <comment212104> As of April 2015 - Yes, this is a NO-GO. Any combination of 2 displays work, but not 3 at the same time.
