Can you use a single partition for two different time machine backups? <body> I have a hard drive which has emone/em HFS partition of 1TB that is being used as a MacBook backup.  Can I backup another MacBook to the same partition without overwriting or convoluting data?  <answer267954> Yes, the Time Machine system handles this automatically.  There's one major drawback in that you cannot decide on a storage quota for each backup. This means that if you have 1 TB of backup storage, you cannot decide that 500 GB is reserved for computer A and 500 GB for computer B.  So if the backup of one computer is too large, that could make it impossible to take a full backup of the other computer.  You can limit the size of a Time Machine backup though by executing on each Mac:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize -integer size /code/pre  with emsize/em in MB. Example:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine MaxSize -integer 500000 /code/pre  <comment336291> added a TM size limiting command <comment336376> Would the folder structure reflect that there are two separate computers? <comment336394> Time Machine creates a seperate sparsebundle for each computer. They are called `computer name`.sparsebundle - for example "Kolobs MacBook Air.sparsebundle".
