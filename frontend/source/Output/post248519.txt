Leave the python on the system as it is and use your own Python installation you get from HomeBrew.  See here: http://brew.sh/   Pip is provided if you install python with brew. I can really recommend using pyenv also and if you want to do Python development have a good look at the community variant of PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).  <comment307947> See this question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26279207/installing-pip-using-easy-install and definitely use virtual environments - but you should work out if it might be easier to manage with anaconda or a general purpose package system like macports or home-brew <comment307971> Also check out http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209572/how-to-use-pip-after-the-os-x-el-capitan-upgrade
