"file not sent" from Android to Macbook, whereas they're paired <body> I'm trying to send a file from Android to Macbook via bluetooth. I pair them successfully and when I'm sending a file from Android, it just ends up saying "file not sent". In the Macbook does happen nothing at that time, no pop up window or something.  That's it.  <answer170867> In strongSystem Preferences  Sharing  Bluetooth Sharing/strong, ensure that strongFolder for accepted items/strong is set to something. If it isn't set, incoming file transfers are rejected automatically.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CrjO3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment297101> Any other things I should check?  Bluetooth and Bluetooth sharing are on, 'when receiving' is 'ask', accepted items folder is set and Android phone paired but still file is still rejected. <comment371708> Also Bluetooth sharing can get turned off somehow. I checked mine and it was off even though it was on yesterday.
