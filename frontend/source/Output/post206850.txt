How to completely remove GoToMeeting.app? <body> I installed the codeGoToMeeting.app/code because a client used it. I no longer need it, but I can't seem to remove it. Its burrowed in worse than most malware found on a PC.  I tried a simple drag and drop from the strongemcodeApplications/code/em/strong folder to the strongemcodeTrash/code/em/strong, but that did not work.  I then dropped into the command line:  precode$ ls /Applications/Go* /Applications/GoToMeeting: GoToMeeting (3019).app  GoToMeeting (3356).app GoToMeeting (3277).app  GoToMeeting (3499).app $ /code/pre  Then:  precode$ sudo rm -rf /Applications/GoToMeeting* $ ls /Applications/Go* $ /code/pre  Finally, reboot and then:  precode$ ls /Applications/Go* GoToMeeting (WWW).app  GoToMeeting (XXX).app GoToMeeting (YYY).app  GoToMeeting (ZZZ).app $ /code/pre  So I get another set of them.  Something is running in privileged mode, and it seems to be hiding itself:  precode$ sudo find /Library -iname GoToMeeting 2&gt;/dev/null $ $ sudo ps -A | grep -i GoToMeeting 13644 ttys000    0:00.00 grep -i GoToMeeting $ /code/pre  The hit above is the terminal session searching for the process.  How do I completely remove this application?  <answer208754> It's in your user library. Try this:  precoderm -fv ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.citrixonline.GoToMeeting.G2MUpdate.plist  rm -rfv ~/Library/Application\ Support/CitrixOnline/ /code/pre  <comment249350> Have a look at: [How do I uninstall GoToMeeting on my Mac?](http://support.citrixonline.com/en_US/meeting/knowledge_articles/000048860) <comment249353> Thanks  user3439894. Based on the behavior I am seeing, I don't believe its a complete remediation. That is, I don't believe it will completely remove all the application components (otherwise, nuk'ing it from the command line would have worked). Where can I find a list of the malware included with their primary ***`GoToMeeting.app`***? <comment251752> Thanks. That appears to be it. How did GoToMeeting re-install itself into `/Applications`? That's protected and requires privileges, but I was never prompted with a `sudo`. (And its the reason all my `find`'s occurred in `/Library`, and not `~/Library`). <comment251772> If your user is an admin, it has explicit write permissions for  /Applications/:  `drwxrwxr-x+ 79 root  admin  2686 Oct  2 20:17 Applications`  Since the launch agent runs as you, it write to /Applications/. <comment251774> Since the program run by the launch agent runs as your user, it can also write to /Applications/  I can't English today. <comment251790> *"Since the program run by the launch agent..."* - OK, this appear to be another related issue. I use [Loadables](http://vladalexa.com/apps/osx/loadables/) to track startup programs, but it never reported anything for my user account. Additionally, Apple's [Users & Groups](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18901?locale=en_US) settings applet did not report it. <comment251905> I'm not familiar with Loadables (although it looks useful), so I'm not sure why it didn't show up there. The items listed under Login Items in the Users and Groups prefpane are not launch agents. Those items are just entries in ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist.
