How to reverse the F keys default functionality <body> I am newbie Mac user and I recently stumbled upon this annoying F6 problem: when I debug in Xcode or Eclipse, I must use kbdfn/kbd+kbdF6/kbd to run the debugger. By default, F6 is the function key to adjust the keyboard light. How can I reverse its functionality, in order to use kbdF6/kbd for the debugger and kbdfn/kbd+kbdF6/kbd for the keyboard light?  <answer66889> System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard tab - check "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"  <answer66893> You can also invert single keys with FunctionFlip:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3NzlF.png" alt=""  <answer127726> And Paula allows you to set the global F1-F12 vs "special key" mode based on the focused application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rAKts.png" alt="Paula Smart Mode Preferences"  <comment78773> it's fantastic!!
