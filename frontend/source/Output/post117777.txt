Alfred Keeps Asking For Contacts Permission <body> I'm not sure what is going on. Every time I access Alfred, I get this dialog box, "Alfred would like to access your contacts." I always have to click "OK" before I can use the program. I have verified that the Alfred checkbox is checked in the Contacts settings in System Preferences. Does anyone have any other ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/54KJ0.png" alt="Alfred"  <answer118409> Are you running Alfred version 2.1.1 ?  If you open Alfred codePreferences/code and check the codeFeatures/code pane you can click on codeContacts/code and try toggling codeOpen Contacts in Alfred/code.   You might also try checking the codeWorkflows/code pane and see if you have any workflows using Contacts.  <answer120050> Is your copy of Alfred properly licensed, or pirated?  I'll admit that mine was pirated, and the newest cracked version kept asking for contacts, presumably because the code signing required for the Mac Store also applies to contact permissions.  If the code is changed (which it is in the cracking process) Apple's contact permissions API will need to continually ask for permission, since it doesn't recognize the program.  You might try Quicksilver instead; it's like Alfred but free and does more, although it's also more complicated and less shiny.  <answer126340> Try running these commands in Terminal:  sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db  sqlite INSERT or REPLACE INTO access values ('kTCCServiceAddressBook','com.runningwithcrayons.Alfred-2', 0, 1, 0, NULL);  sqlite .exit  <answer140631> You might want to look into Privacy Services Manager coming out of the University of Utah: https://github.com/univ-of-utah-marriott-library-apple/privacy_services_manager Once you're set up, Terminal command: privacy_services_manager.py add contacts /Applications/Chess.app  <answer212352> Just like @nobody-in-particular said, your Alfred code was probably changed , therefor the signature that was in place for Alfred is no longer valid. What you have to do is sign the application after the changes to the code.  This worked for me:  precodesudo codesign --force --deep --sign - "/Applications/Alfred 2.app/Contents/Frameworks/Alfred Framework.framework/Versions/A/Alfred Framework" /code/pre  <comment139888> You may want to consider asking the question here http://www.alfredforum.com/forum/2-v2-discussion-help/ <comment147935> what's that do? <comment147940> As l'L'L put it, please provide an explanation or reference of these commands that you are asking the OP to enter so that your answer becomes more credible.
