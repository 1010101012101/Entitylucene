Rescuing a hard drive with ddrescue <body> After following a few forums, I was able to rescue my hard drive with codeddrescue/code. It took almost 24 hours, to rescue my files into a .dmg file. When it was completed I double clicked on the dmg file, and I get no mountable file system.   Can anyone help, my first born pictures are on this hard disk, and I would truly be quite upset if I can not retrieve them.  <answer247616> Try to manually mount it:  ul liOpen strongDisk Utility.app/strong/li liClick strongFile  Open Disk Image/strong/li liSelect the code.dmg/code file./li /ul  This should allow you to mount/open the dmg file and install its contents.  <comment305552> Please add the used command(s) to rescue your hard drive! AFAIR ddrescue itself can't create a mountable dmg file. <comment305677> Like I said, on one forum it stated to use this command:                               sudo ddrescue -v /dev/disk1s2 /Volumes/Backup/myvolimage.dmg rescue.log                      That's exactly what I did, however the .dmg isn't mounting. <comment305678> I have tried this, but after selecting the disk image, nothing mounts.
