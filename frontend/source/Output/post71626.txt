Are 17″ MacBook Pro for sale by Apple? <body> I have a 2010 Macbook Pro 17″  It does not have a Thunderbolt port. I believe about a year ago Apple released a 17" that had a thunderbolt port. I was thinking about upgrading to a newer 17" model but there is now 17" macbooks in the Apple Store. I want a new Mac, not anything from the refurbished section.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6UKdA.png" alt=""  I checked MacRumors and there is no news about a newer 17". I also heard that a 17" with retina display seemed pretty impossible - because of the price / technology limitations etc.  Does Apple still sell a 17 inch portable Mac?  <answer71628> Here's your answer: Apple discontinues 17 inch MacBook Pro  From the site:     "But if you’re looking for a reason why Apple offed the 17-inch now, you need go no further than the 15-inch Retina display MacBook Pro. Not only does it offer the most cutting edge technology of any Apple laptop to date, but its 2880-by-1800 pixel display outstrips the 17-inch’s 1920-by-1200 resolution with room to spare. Add in the fact that the new MacBook Pro is thinner and lighter—to the tune of more than 2 pounds—and it seems pretty clear that the Retina display model is the new target for what a powerhouse portable should be."   <answer71629> Apple discontinued the 17" MacBook Pro when they announced the 15" Retina MBP. It's fairly unlikely they'll make another one any time soon (probably never, if I were putting money on it). You may be able to get one refurbished or from a third party reseller with stock left.  <comment83192> damn. but i love the 17".
