Changing my display cable from HDMI to Display Mini lead to resolution issue mac <body> After having a problem with the HDMI cable on Samsung Syncmaster 1600x900, I changed it to a DisplayPort to VGA adapter, but now it is not detecting the monitor correctly.  The available resolutions for it is now 1280x1024 &amp; 800x600. I have shifted already to custom resolution of 1280x768 by selecting a custom resolution after pressing option and then selecting scaled displays.  But I want it to have its original resolution.  It feels like it has supposed my monitor to be secondary display.  P.S. : Already have deleted com.apple.windowserver.plist in Safe Mode.  <answer211806> Ok, now it wasn't the adapter, but the cable VGA cable which was not working out for me.  As I was suing the original Apple DisplayPort adapter.  <comment255178> It is telling me to get a Apple Display adapter (original), which I already have.
