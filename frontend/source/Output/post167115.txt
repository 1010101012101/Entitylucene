Safari 8 Not Showing Network Requests when using the web inspector/develop tools <body> I have a feeling that I may have toggled some settings, but I can't find it anymore.  Basically I am trying to monitor requests sent from my webapp. The usual method is Inpect Element - Timelines - Network Requests, where Safari gives me a graph and a list of all the requests made.  Now I can see the graph, but I can't see the list of the requests made.   Here's a screenshot illustrating where I'd like to see the requests:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPTDg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer174573> Deselect timeline (between 10 and 12 seconds)
