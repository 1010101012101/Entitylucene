IPhone 4s email issues (with gmail) <body> So I've had my I've had my 4s for almost 6 months now, and haven't had a problem with my email - or that I've noticed. However, recently, I've found I am unable to send emails, only recieve them.  I've tried deleteting and readmistering the mail address - but to no avail. Any ideas anyone?  <comment58591> Sometimes a reboot can help. Hold the lock button until you get the "Slide to power off" slider. Slide it to shut it off, then turn it back on again by holding the power button. Does that help? <comment58601> Is your gmail address working fine on your computer and/or other device(s)?
