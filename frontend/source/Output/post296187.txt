Can I get the color settings of Mac MS Office 2016 in some file to easily re-install on other iDevices? <body> For some reason I have a specific color setting in Mac MS Office 2016 (see attached screenshot). When I get a new device, I have to manually set that again.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iv8Xs.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a away to get it in some file that I can easily "re-install" these settings on new devices?   In other words: where are these colorsettings stored? Is there some file under code~/Library/.../code?  Thanks  Sander (Apologies for the somewhat generic description, I find it hard to describe - open for suggestions to improve!)
