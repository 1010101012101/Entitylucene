Why is my Mountain Lion download freezing at 53.25 MB? <body> I have been trying for about a day now, and no matter how many times I pause/resume or cancel and retry, my download of Mountain Lion is freezing at 53.25MB.  Why is it freezing and how can I resolve this issue?  <answer58020> There have been lots of discussion over the past few days on this, but these two threads seem to have the best details:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4135141?start=45&amp;tstart=0 http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1410290  The solution boils down to two main causes:  ol liBT routers are known to have some kind of limit or cap on them.

The solution is to pause your download, sign into a VPN or download Hotspot Shield, and start up the download process again. Once you've completed the download, you can disconnect/uninstall the VPN access./li /ol  For the record, option 2 was what I needed.
