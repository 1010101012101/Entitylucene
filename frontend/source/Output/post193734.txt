iCloud Music Library can't be enabled <body> I downloaded iOS 8.4 this morning, and activated Apple Music. I started browsing, and found an album I wanted to add to my library. When I tried to add it, I was told that I needed to enable iCloud Music Library, and was directed to the settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8TAOa.png" width="320" / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S3WGB.png" width="320" /  However, when I try to enable it in the settings, I get an error saying that "iCloud Music Library can't be enabled". No further details are available. This error occurs whether I choose to "Merge" or "Replace" my device's current library.  What do I need to do to get past this error?  <answer193735> Keep trying. After toggling the setting to enable it a dozen times over twenty minutes, it finally worked. This appears to have been a temporary problem associated with the launch.  <answer193754> From iMore     ol   liLaunch Settings from the Home screen./li   liTap Music (note, the icon has changed colors)./li   liToggle iCloud Music Library to On./li   liChoose if you want to Replace or Merge your library. (I ultimately chose Merge when it worked)./li   liIf you get the error again, dismiss it./li   liRepeat steps 3-4 until it works./li   /ol   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JIKWv.jpg" alt="settings"  <answer193828> h2Wait until tomorrow./h2  There are millions of people trying to enable, signing up and "force retrying" to activate Apple Music at the same time; from Apple's point of view this probably looks as a DDoS.  <comment231078> Turn on and off airplane mode ... It worked for me <comment231079> Turning airplane mode on then off worked for me. <comment231080> Just keep trying. It worked on my 30th attempt. As others have mentioned, Apple is probably getting slammed with people activating their free trial to Apple Music. <comment231081> I rebooted the phone and it worked.
