What is the best way to install Node js on OS X? <body> I currently have installed node and npm with the installer provided from their website. Although I have homebrew installed as well, and running codebrew doctor/code seems to complain about some files installed by the node js installer at /usr/local/include/.  Is installing node through homebrew a better way (e.g. easier to manage, less errors and warnings, etc.)?  <answer237156> I find the best way to install Node.js is to use nvm, which allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.  I use Homebrew for pretty much everything else, but Node is easier to use through nvm, since it doesn't use global folders - everything is in your home directory, and you can easily switch between Node versions.  To install (check the website for the latest version):  precodecurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash /code/pre  There are some specific notes about OS X on the web site, please make sure to read through those, e.g. regarding the use of the code~/.bash_profile/code file.  After that, the codenvm/code function will allow you to specify which version of node to install and use. In the simplest case, you run  precodenvm install node /code/pre  which will install the stable version of Node.js.
