Backup connected Hard Drive to Time Capsule <body> I am trying to make this happen:  Mac Pro (MP) ----- Time Capsule (TC)  ----- External Hard Drive (EHD)  I wish to use EHD as a file server to my MP. Mainly so I can keep my MP hard drive as clear as possible so it runs well.  My MP is currently being backed up to TC in the normal way. Which is great, I wish to keep that.  The EHD is plugged into the TC and I can access it as normal. What I can not seem to do, is set up Time Machine to Backup the EHD to TC.  <comment343773> You can't, Time Machine can only backup drives formatted as HFS+ and only drives physically connected to a Mac.
