Dust halo around home button <body> My new black iPhone 5 has fairly significant dust buildup around the edge of the home button after just a few days' use. It is most noticeable when looking down the screen from the top of the device.  This is my first iPhone so I am not sure if this is normal or not. Is it safe to take a little compressed air to try and blow it out?  <comment78214> Can you post a picture? <comment78261> @duci9y ~ I will as soon as I get my old phone charged enough to take one:)
