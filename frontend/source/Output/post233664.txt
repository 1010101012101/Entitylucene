Retina MacBook Pro (non-Force touch) trackpad can't "click" as usual <body> I was working with my mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro yesterday and everything was normal. Today, when I turned it on, I've noticed that trackpad is feeling a bit "weird". It's like, unless I forcefully touch the trackpad, it's not registering any click. It was much smoother and easy-to-press just yesterday, and it was just inside my hard-bag all the day, not damaged etc. It feels like it's a force-touch trackpad (while it's not), this is the closest I can describe how it feels. I can't get the regular "click" feeling and response from the trackpad.  What should I do?  <answer233666> Nevermind. I started to press firmly all around the trackpad, and it just went back to normal. There was probably some dust particles in, and pressing around the trackpad eliminated them.
