I don't know what my apple login is anymore - I have an iPad <body> How can I find my Apple login code or change it? I want to buy things from the apps store but cannot get beyond the starting screen.  <answer143412> Use this form to recover your Apple ID:  https://iforgot.apple.com/appleid  <comment168872> If you mean your lockscreen code, maybe you need to restore your ipad(which cause all your data lost unless you backup via itunes if possible).Or you mean the Apple Id password? Then you should check it out on www.apple.com for support.Usually you can reset it as long as your email used for Apple Id is available. <comment168873> This is a good place to start to make sure the OP understands what an Apple ID is and has control of it in terms of the username and password. Also, just having them log in to https://appleid.apple.com also works. They get sent to iforgot if they can't enter the password :-)
