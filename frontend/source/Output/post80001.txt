Which models of iPhone 5 are compatible with CDMA in India? <body> Can I use my CDMA sim in iPhone 5 ? I am using TATA INDICOM CDMA sim.  <answer80024> No.  iPhones only have GSM SIM slots.  The CDMA iPhone 5 can only use CDMA on the carrier which sold the phone. Those phones also have a GSM nanoSIM slot for use around the world.  <answer199051> The Sprint iPhone 5 is CDMA and has a slot. And it uses a CDMA SIM card. Plus it supports GSM too. Therefore it does work.  Source: Personal experience.  <comment238419> Answers are reordered in StackExchange, so you can not say "false" in an answer as a comment to another one.
