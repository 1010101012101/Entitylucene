What are good sources for iPhone 4/iPad wallpapers? <body> There are plenty of sites out there that compile wallpapers, but most have a very low signal:noise ratio. I don't want to deal with so much 'rough' to find a couple 'diamonds'. Are there places that have a generally high level of quality?  <answer15977> Mantia (who now works for Apple) has a nice selection of geeky iPhone/iPad wallpapers. Some of his stuff is featured at the Iconfactory, along with some other wallpapers by Dave Brasgalla, Gedeon Maheux and others.  <comment17411> I can't mark this as "Community Wiki" although I believe it should be one. <comment17440> flag this for moderator attention so they can mark it as community wiki <comment19999> Done and done. Now a community wiki.
