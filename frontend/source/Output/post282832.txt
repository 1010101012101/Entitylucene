How can I export a Numbers 3.x chart to PDF? <body> I created a chart in Numbers 3 (version 3.6.2). In earlier versions of Numbers I could copy the chart and paste it into, e.g., Adobe Illustrator as a PDF vectorgraphic.  In 3.6.2, copy and paste results in a blurry (low resolution) bit mapped image being pasted.  How can I get a PDF version of my chart?  <answer282833> ol liopen the context menu on the chart (e.g., control-click or right-mouse click)/li liselect emCopy as PDF/em./li lipaste into application (e.g. Adobe Illustrator) or in Preview create a new file with emFile/em - emNew from Clipboard/em and save as PDF./li /ol  When copied and pasted in this way, the chart remains a high-resolution vector graphic.
