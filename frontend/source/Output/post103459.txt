Music purchased on iPhone keeps being resynched on to the phone after I delete it <body> I hope some bright spark can help with this.  If I purchase music from iTunes on my iPhone 5, I'd like to be able to delete it from the phone at some point whilst keeping it on iTunes.    However, every time I resynch the phone, iTunes adds all the purchased albums back on even though I have only selected specific artists to be synched.  This means I have less and less space for artists I now want on my phone as the purchased albums increase.  Any suggestions?
