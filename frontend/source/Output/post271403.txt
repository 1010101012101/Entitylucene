iTunes 12.5.4: generic icons in "artists" view sidebar? <body> In iTunes 12.5.4, I have mostly generic icons in the "artists' view. This is a huge waste of vertical height and I wish I could turn off these icons  – but since I can't, does anyone understand how these icons are populated with image data? I have a few icons with images but did nothing (knowingly) to accomplish that.  (sorry the image is so huge)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9chP3.png" alt="enter image description here"
