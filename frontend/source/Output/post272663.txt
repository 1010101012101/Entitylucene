How can I see app reviews in itunesconnect from all store fronts? <body> Itunesconnect says my app has "6 reviews" (woohoo!), but I can't see them. It says "No reviews for this store front". I assume (after some googling) that the store front is associated with country. I tried changing from United States in the dropdown at the top, but United States is the only choice.  I'd like to see all reviews regardless of store front/language. Is this possible?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQbp7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer272716> I think it just mean you have 6 people rated your app but no one has written any reviews. But I don't think it is possible to see reviews from all regions.  It could also be possible that review takes time to show up. source     Your review might need to be approved before it's published, so it might not appear immediately.   <comment342780> Could be that rating=review, but it's very confusing since it says 6 ratings at top, then 6 reviews below, so it implies they are separate things.
