Sync applescript calls. <body> I'm very new to applescripting and I have the following code:  precodetell application "Safari"     tell document 1         do JavaScript "document.getElementById(\"binaryFilePath\").click()"     end tell end tell  tell application "System Events"     keystroke "G" using {command down, shift down}     delay 2     key code 51     delay 2     keystroke "hello"     delay 30     key code 52     delay 10     key code 52     delay 5 end tell /code/pre  This is working fine, with Safari. But the problem here is, script needs Safari to be active. So I cant run against multiple Safari.   I'm actually trying to upload files using Selenium against Safari (in which Selenium apis aren;t working here), so gone with this approach, but now I cant run multiple sessions.   Any idea will be helpful, if that can be done in applescript?  h2Edit:/h2  A quick thought, what if we can say to applescript that create only one context at a time (sort of get the "lock" in java terms), so that others wait before one gets over? Any ideas will be really helpful.
