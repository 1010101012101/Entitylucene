Can I put a MBP (2012)'s hard drive into a Lenovo laptop and continue using MacOS? <body> My 15inch 2012MBP has just died. The screen is gone and I want to keep using my old settings but I dont have money to buy a new MB right now. So I'm just wondering what happen if I put my old Apple Hard drive into another laptop that is not a mac. Do I risk losing data or will the OS not load at all? Please help! Thanks!  <answer284870> It will simply not load at all.br Any non-Apple computer will not even recognise the hard drive's format type without extra software installed.  It is theoretically possible to get a non-Apple computer to boot to macOS/OS X, but it is against Apple's licensing agreement to do so &amp; is consequently off-topic on all of Stack Exchange.br It's also not a trivial task &amp; not guaranteed to work.  <comment359228> +1 I like it. Short, simple, straight to the point! :)
