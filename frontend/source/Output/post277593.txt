macOS Sierra: Use non-existing functional key (e.g. F19) in shortcuts <body> My MacBook Pro is configured with several input sources and I want to use Caps Lock to switch between them. Unfortunately, I cannot do this using standard macOS Sierra functionality (i.e. built-in macOS Sierra allows to use Caps Lock only for dedicated Arabic languages).  But I have Karabiner-Elements that allows me to map Caps Lock to some functional keys (like F19). It would be great if I could use F19 in standard Keyboard-Shortcuts menu (e.g. for "input source" - "Select the previous input source").  Any ideas?
