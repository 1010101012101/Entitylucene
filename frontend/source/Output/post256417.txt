How can I view Java documentation offline on my iPad? <body> I would like to know if I can view Java documentation on my iPad while offline. I have seen options/apps on the App Store, but they need to be purchased in order to use them. Examples include 'jdocs' and 'jdoc java 8 api' by Brian.  I am afraid of online transactions even if they are in small amounts. Can someone suggest to me how to view offline Java documentation on my iPad?  <comment319796> By "java doc" I am assuming you mean Java source code (uncompiled, of course)? <comment319797> nope sorry java documentation api I mean..thanks allan
