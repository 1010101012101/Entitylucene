How to save/export as a MIDI file in GarageBand <body> Opening a midi file (.mid) in GarageBand is the easiest thing ever, but how do I go the other direction? I want to take a piece I recorded as a midi performance in GarageBand and turn it into a midi file. How can this be done?   hr  Background:  ul liI have GarageBand 10.1.6/li liI record midi performances all the time in GarageBand and can easily export them as an MP3 /li liI want to save/export them as midi files so that I can open them in Synthesia (Synthesia only opens midi files) /li /ul  <answer291630> Unfortunately, Garageband doesn't support MIDI export.  However, you could consider buying Apple's Logic Pro X, which is the "pro version" of GarageBand. It is quite pricey and might be overkill if you are just dealing with simple MIDI projects but it offers a great deal of features.  With Logic you can open your Garageband projects and export your tracks as MIDI files.  <answer293195> From Scott Troyer: Export MIDI from GarageBandsup*/sup:     One of the biggest drawbacks [of GarageBand] is the lack of built-in support for exporting MIDI data.       (...)      However, a nice guy named Lars Kobbe has put together a workaround/hack that extracts MIDI data from the reluctant clutches of GarageBand. You can download his GB2MIDI Apple droplet script from his site: MIDI-Export in Apples Garageband. Hereâ€™s the direct download: GB2MIDI.ZIP   Once you have downloaded GB2MIDI and you have your MIDI performance in GarageBand, you may create a MIDI file (.mid) using the following steps:  ol liJoin the regions of the track you want as a MIDI file (command + J)/li liConvert that region to a loop (File  Add Region to Loop Library or drag-and-drop into loops area)/li liFind that loop (.aif) file you just created in your hard drive  ul li/Users/strongUser'sName/strong/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/User Loops/SingleFiles /li /ul/li liPut the loop thru GB2MIDI converter by simply dragging-and-dropping it onto the icon for the GB2MIDI converter/li liClick "Run" when the GB2MIDI prompt pops up/li liGrab the freshly extracted .mid file (now found in the same folder where the .aif loop was)/li /ol  Now use the MIDI file for whatever you wanted. In my case, I'd open the MIDI file in Synthesia. Thanks to this process, I can make videos like this one.  hr  sup*/supSee the sourced article for additional details and/or troubleshooting if needed. So far, these steps have worked great for me. :)  <comment368190> Do you know of any programs that can record a midi performance (like GarageBand) but that _can_ export as a MIDI file? <comment368192> Most programs I know having this feature are not free. But with a quick search if found a free version of ["n-Track" on the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/n-track-free/id446363299?mt=12) which seems to be what you are looking for. However, ratings are not that great... <comment369191> I may have found something, so far so good: http://www.larskobbe.de/midi-export-in-apples-garageband/ and http://scotttroyer.com/2014/05/export-midi-from-garageband/ <comment369233> If you found a solution that works, consider answering your own question for people with the same problem
