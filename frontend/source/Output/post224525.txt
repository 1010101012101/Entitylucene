Unable to connect to GameCenter servers (NSURLErrorDomain error -1001) <body> Since a really long time, I've been unable to connect to GameCenter on my iPad mini 1. I've recently updated from iOS 8.4 to iOS 9.2.1, but the issue is still there. However, it now gives me this alert everytime I try to login:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3W1xn.jpg" alt="NSURLErrorDomain error -1001"  I have then made a lot of searches on the web, but found absolutly no working solutions...  Here's what I tried:  ul liLogging both thru App and Settings/li liRestarting device/li liResetting device (long press on power/home buttons)/li liResetting Network settings AND all settings/li liReinstalling iOS/li liLogging off and on from iTunes/AppleStore/AppleID/li liFlushing DNS cache/li liChanging DNS to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4/li liAll of them in all possible orders/li /ul  My router firewall shouldn't not block any games, so I'm pretty sure that's not the problem...  Does anyone have any idea on what's happening?
