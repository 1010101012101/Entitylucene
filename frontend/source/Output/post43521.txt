Keybinding shortcut to emulate Vim o/O (New line below/above current line) <body> I am using XCode for development but have come accustomed to the o/O shortcut in Vim to create a new line below/above the current line without having to move to the beginning/end of the current line.  There are some Emacs keybindings on OS X like Ctrl+f to move forward one character but I haven't been able to find anything for this one.  An alternative might be to use Keyboard Maestro but I'd prefer to not need extra programs if possible.
