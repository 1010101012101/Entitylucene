Hard drive can not be partitioned after shutdown during prior partition <body> Whilst partitioning my Mac Hard Drive to install Windows 7 via the bootcamp assistant, my computer - oblivious to me until too late - ran out of charge. When I turned it back on, as expected, the was no completed partition and bootcamp assistant still gave me the option to partition my hard drive. When I tried to partition my drive however, I get an error stating that:     strongDisk could not be partitioned/strong      An error occurred while partitioning the disk   I assume this is because I already have a semi-complete partition existing.  More reason to think this is apparent when I ran the disk utility application and saw that despite there only being one drive (Macintosh HD) This only took up 450Gb (Out of 500Gb) - the rest blank. Since my partition was 50Gb, you would assume that that is what is taking up that space and disabling a new partition.  Any idea of how I can fix this?
