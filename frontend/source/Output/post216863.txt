How to access an external drive <body> I plug in a flash drive to my USB port. How can I access it through bash?    (code$ cd  //code takes me to the directory called codeMacintosh HD/code, but through Finder, I can go up one more directory called code&lt;myname&gt;'s MacBook Pro/code. However,    precode$ cd / $ cd .. /code/pre  doesn't allow me to go to the directory code&lt;myname&gt;'s MacBook Pro/code.) How can I get to the files on my flash-drive?  <answer216866> All volumes on internal or external hard disks/thumb drives/DVDs etc. are mounted to the directory /Volumes by default. The boot volume itself is linked as a soft link here.  Example:  precodeuser$ cd /Volumes/ ... dr-xr-xr-x   2 user      admin  -     12936 23 Nov 16:45 Audio-CD drwxrwx---  14 user      admin  -       544 27 Okt 09:43 ExternalDrive lrwxr-xr-x   1 root      admin  -         1 23 Nov 07:59 MacintoshHD -&gt; / drwx------   1 user      staff  -       296 21 Nov 07:56 NetworkShare drwxrwx---  14 user      admin  -       544 14 Okt 16:22 ThumbDrive ... /code/pre  To access your thumb drive you have to enter codecd /Volumes/name_of_thumb_drive/code.  <answer217030> The above answer by @klanomath is absolutely correct.  I tried to add this as a comment, but the markdown code parsing didn't like it.  The following bash command lists the external drives you currently have mounted.  precodemount | egrep `diskutil list | grep external | awk '{print $1}' | tr '\n' '|' | sed -e 's/|$//' | sed -e 's#|#\\|#'` | awk '{print $1 " -&gt; " $3}' /code/pre  On my Macbook with two flashdrives plugged in I get:  precode/dev/disk3 -&gt; /Volumes/XXXXX /dev/disk5 -&gt; /Volumes/YYYYY /code/pre
