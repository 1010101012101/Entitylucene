Safari sends different list of supported ciphers for two URLs on the same domain <body> I am having weird issue with Safari since IOS was upgraded to 10.2.1 on iPad. There are multiple URLs mapped to the same common name and they are pointed to the same VIP and then iPlanet (version 4.0.7). For one URL, Safari consistently sends the list of 22 ciphers out of which TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA is supported by the iPlanet. All other ciphers in the list are not supported by the iPlanet version we have.  When I call the URL that fails on the SSL Hanshake, I see that Safari sends list of ciphers and none of them is supported by iPlanet.   One option we have is to just upgrade iPlanet to support lot more new ciphers. However, the concern is the inconsistent behavior between the two URLs. Again, the certificate on server has both URLs as alternate names, they both are intercepted by iPlanet's same instance which acts as proxy to a "Balance" server (second level proxy).  Can someone please help with this issue, it should either work for all URLs or none. The issue is happening only on Safari browser on iPad (v10.2.1), Chrome works fine on the same device. All other devices (iPhone, iMac, PC, Android) are working fine with both URLs.  Thanks
