Mail doesn't send until restart <body> I'm using a 3rd party app on an iPad which sends out PDF reports as mail attachments. My issue though is that the message never sends, until I restart my iPad. This effect is not reproduced if I close the App (double-tap, flick) so I'm considering it might be an issue with the OS, or else how the app invokes the APIs.  My iPad is brand new and specifically for work and has no other accounts set up, and my colleagues all use the same App with no issues, though on older iPads that probably aren't as up to date on the OS.  I've been looking this issue up online but really nothing matches my issue but there does seem to be a whole heap of issues with email on iOS 10. I'm just wondering if anybody on here more familiar with the workings of the iOS email APIs might have some understanding of what is going on here. In particular what could be missing that is preventing the mail from being sent, but that otherwise gets resolved during an orderly shut-down?
