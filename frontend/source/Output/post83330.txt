Can't access Mail or Mail setttings on iphone 4 + iOS 6.1.2 <body> Since the upgrade to iOS 6, I've been unable to access my mail on wi-fi, cellular or disconnected.   The symptoms are:  ul liThe mail button icon shows '1'/li liWhen clicking on te mail app icon, it attempts to open up the app, then it times out and goes back to the home screen/li liWhen clicking on settings - Mail, Contacts, and Calendars, the phone gets stuck and times out then goes back to the home screen./li /ul  <answer83880> First, force-quit Mail.app. To do this: Go to your home screen. Double-click the home screen. Locate Mail.app in the bottom bar that appears. Press and hold Mail.app until the icons wiggle. Delete Mail.app from the bottom bar by clicking red X.  Try again to launch Mail. If this doesn't work, reset the iPhone by pressing and holding power and home buttons for 10 seconds. Restart device once it shuts off.  <answer83947> ul liyou could try this, though it's unlikely since you can see the mail icon  ol liTry going to the Settings.app./li liOnce inside: General/li liscroll down and select "Restrictions" (this is at the bottom/li liMake sure Mail is both 'allowed' ('On') and that Restrictions are disabled, unless you want them enabled.

Hopefully your mail messages exist in such a way that you can reset/restore without losing anything. (Depends on mail settings.

I'm sure you have, but, you have rebooted the phone, right? What about backing up to iCloud (and iTunes, if you want) and restoring the device? Can you go to Settings  iCloud  Account? <comment97061> Thanks! but It didn't work. iOS didn't let me delete it. It freezes again <comment97062> Restrictions are off. I think my best option forward is to perhaps factory reinstall <comment97115> Factory restore is my suggestion now given the feedback you've provided both of us. <comment99632> Yes, do report if it works out, or not. <comment109381> Not an answer- I have the same problem 4S IOS 6.1.3. Gmail and charter email account. Everything works on my MacBook Pro. Mail icon shows 20. Tap it and I get a white screen for 1-2 secs then closes to the main screen. Same thing happens when I choose mail under settings. No restrictions. Have tried to restart and reset after shutting down mail. Have not done factory reset, want to see if there is a fix.
