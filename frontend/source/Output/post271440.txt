USB Ports Not Providing Enough Power to Charge iPhone and Use Elgato <body> A few days ago I was able to charge my iPhone via my iMac and power every USB powered piece of tech I've picked up via the USB ports on the back of my iMac.  Yesterday I purchased a used Elgato HD Game Capture Card from a friend and it worked fine. However, I noticed that my phone stopped charging through the USB ports. I put it to back of my mind, however, today my iMac can no longer power the Elgato (it keeps loosing connection to Elgato) and still can not charge my iPhone.  This is most definitely the USB's fault as my phone charges perfectly on other devices as well as the wall socket. I just need to fix the issue so I can use my Elgato.  I am running Windows 10 on my late 2013 21.5 inch iMac.  Does anyone have any solutions?  I've asked elsewhere yet people have just suggested resetting the SMC but it doesn't help. I've also been suggested to use a AC powered hub but I shouldn't need to. This was working fine a day or so ago.  Thanks in advance.
