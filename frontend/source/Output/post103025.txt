iOS 6 displaying update badge, no update available <body> My app store is displaying an update as badge. When I click the App Store, it claims I have all updates.  What did Apple do?  <answer103026> strongUpdate/strong: The apps now appear to be available to download. Anyone else seeing this now too?  hr  I am seeing this behaviour too and am 98% sure the updates are for for apps on your phone which require iOS7 or later.  I am not aware of a fix at this stage.   <comment121270> That makes sense, however they should remove the icon for me? Stupid update badge. <comment121395> Yes, it's a little annoying. I think if you open up the App Store app and open the Updates page, the badges disappear (temporarily). <comment121429> Updated original answer, apps now appear available for download. <comment121436> I had 2 badges visible, only 1 update. So not solved (yet)
