how can i change the apple id on App Store? <body> On my 2009 MacBook, my friend signed into his Apple ID to check it. Now, I can't sign back into mine to download things.  Does anyone know how to get my Apple ID to sign me back in?  <answer179096> In the Mac App Store, go to the Store menu - Sign Out. This will allow you to sign out of the store.   Note, if he made any purchases during that time, downloaded any apps and/or accepted the updates for the iWork/iLife applications, they may b tied to their AppleID and won't process under yours.
