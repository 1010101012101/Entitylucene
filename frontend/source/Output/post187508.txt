How to disable delay for text dragging globally in OS X Yosemite? <body> h2My question is exactly the same as this one./h2  I have tried both Tinkertool and codedefaults write -g NSDragAndDropTextDelay -int [a number]/codein the two answers of that question. However, none of these can solve the problem. It seems that the lower-limit is strong100 ms/strong and if you set a delay shorter than strong0 ms/strong, the text dragging feature is disabled.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZXl01vf.gif" alt=""  But in strongSublime Text/strong I can easily drag text and feel no delay at all.   img src="https://i.imgur.com/TSv3I1F.gif" alt=""  So I assume there is a way to disable the text dragging delay entirely and globally.  <comment221669> Maybe, depends whether Sublime text is using the standard Cocoa APIs for its text view, or one of its own design. Since it's a cross-platform application, the latter isn't entirely unlikely. <comment221690> That makes sense. It's really annoying when I use an external mouse rather than the touch pad. Mouse makes dragging easier and the delay has no use then. <comment305766> It seems that this feature has been totally disabled for the past few major revisions of OS X. Making any change to it, whether setting it to 100ms or 60000ms has no effect on how long you have to wait before the text starts dragging. I remember it working in Lion, but I think it was completely gone around the time Mavericks came out. It's a shame, but Apple does this far too much. I used to be able to whip text around in an instant with just a few motions, like in one of those old samurai movies, where they would cut the armor off of an opponent without touching them. Now they've got me stuck
