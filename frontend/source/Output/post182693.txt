Smart quotes in Google Chrome <body> We can enable/disable smart quotes for many apps by going to Edit → Substitutions. However, In Google Chrome, “Substitutions” does not exist. When searching online, though, it seems that it might’ve existed at some point, as I find multiple posts on how to disable the feature.  Is it no longer available (and if so why) or is it something on my side?  <answer182947> As claimed by this issue, text substitution appears to have been disabled due to a bug:     Text replacement was originally disabled due to http://crbug.com/173405 but Apple has since fixed the root cause of the issue.   Another issue is open to track progress on the feature.
