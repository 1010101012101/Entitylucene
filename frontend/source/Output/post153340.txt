Not able to boot into Ubuntu after Yosemite Upgrade <body> I am running dual boot on my iMac. I upgraded my OS to OS X Yosemite yesterday,and now I can't boot into Ubuntu. How can I fix my issue?  <answer153357> If your Ubuntu partition is still there, you probably need to install a rEFIt (or an equivalent) so you can choose your Ubuntu partition.  http://refit.sourceforge.net  <answer153435> This gives the simplest solution for me.   precodediskutil list /code/pre  and you will see something like:  precode$diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                         175.6 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data                         70.3 GB    disk0s4    5:                 Linux Swap                         4.2 GB     disk0s5 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           *175.3 GB   disk1                              Logical Volume on disk0s2                              41AF7850-5594-4959-A135-582BF79FDE46                              Unencrypted /code/pre  Then use:   precodediskutil corestorage revert /dev/disk1 /code/pre  And reboot, refind now works again.  I got the solution from the related question here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/150670/install-refind-on-os-x-10-10-yosemite/164614, you can try other solutions there if this one fails.
