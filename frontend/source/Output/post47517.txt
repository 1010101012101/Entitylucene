Amazon Instant on Xbox 360 via OS X <body> Is there a way to view Amazon Instant Video content on the XBox 360 via OS X? The official solution on Amazon's site utilizes a Windows PC, which we don't have: http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/ontv/xbox  Any other way?  I utilize an application called Connect360 (http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360) to get media from my Mac to my Xbox 360. Would love to have a solution for watching Amazon Instant content on the 360 as well.  <answer71757> Amazon now has an official Amazon Instant Video app for the Xbox 360. It is available under emApps/em from the Xbox 360 dashboard.
