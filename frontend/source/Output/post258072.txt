Finder - search in specific subfolders across the whole drive <body> I am trying to find a way how to search in specific subfolders through the whole drive on my mac. I will try to explain what I need exactly;  I have a folder with images called "Photos", which includes subfolders; each of these subfolders has a date as a name and includes at least 2 another subfolders called ORIGINALS and EDITS. Images in "originals" and "edits" folder have matching names.  When I search using command+F in "Photos" folder, my results are duplicated and I want to be able to include only files from "edits" folder.  Is this possible to achieve?  Thanks  <answer258086> You can make a script that uses the codefind/code command and the codedirname/code command to do this but as for doing it in spotlight somehow I don't think so. If you'd like to see a one-liner to do this on the command line I can do this, but it depends on what you want it to output- the containing directory or the full path to the file.  <answer258100> This is one of those situations I'd just use EasyFind - freeware from the App Store.  It's slower than Spotlight, as it doesn't use an index, but its search parameters are far more easily defined &amp; no Terminal-fu required.  <comment323081> I donâ€™t think this question is a duplicate of the linked question. This question asks for a way to exclude all folders named ORIGINALS nested somewhere within the Photos folder. Customizing a saved search to do so would require listing all such folders.  Check out [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/). With HoudahSpot you can search the Photos folder and then filter search results to exclude results where the path contains ORIGINALS.
