Why does my MacBook's screen continually dim and brighten without my input? <body> My MacBook Pro screen constantly dims and brightens.  The automatic box is unchecked.  The brightness adjustment button is constantly moving back and forth.  <answer65633> Maybe the ambient light sensor?   <answer65634> I'd try to reset the strongSystem Management Controller/strong (SMC).  Apple's documentation on the SMC states that this may resolve issues related to the power management. The document specifically mentions:     The display backlight doesn't respond correctly to ambient light changes on Mac computers that have this feature.   As the guidelines on how to reset the SMC depend on your kind of Mac, I will not list them all here. Please follow the link and go to the section with the title strongResetting the System Management Controller (SMC)/strong for more information on how to apply the reset.  Should that not work, you're left with two other avenues to remedy this:  ul lisoftware errors - you might need to troubleshoot or restore the OS /li lihardware fault - the display and sensor might simply need repair/li /ul  <answer65737> Might be an issue with the power supply when “Slightly dim the display when on battery power” is checked in Energy Saver prefs. This would dim the display when the power adapter is lost and become brighter again when not running on battery anymore.  <answer102880> Go your System Preferences, select "Displays", and uncheck Auto-adjust Brightness.    <answer107596> This could be a emkeyboard issue/em. If other things are going wrong with keys, such as the backspace or caps lock, the keyboard (top case) needs replacing.  You can get a temporary fix by using a keyboard remapper program and change the keys for brightness and turn off the usual F1 and F2 ones.  <comment77187> That sounds like a software issue. I would take it to an Apple Store if there is one close to you. If not, you may need to do a re-install. <comment77194> As the OP states, the sensor is turned off in the System Preferences. <comment126156> Isn't this the same as the OP saying they unchecked the automatic box? <comment295723> That would indeed make sense since the screen brightness UI shows up.
