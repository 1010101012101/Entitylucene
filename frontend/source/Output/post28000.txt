What's a good Font Manager for OS X? <body> I am searching for a good font manager for Lion. It should work especially with google web fonts.   I need a good overview of non-alphabetic unicode characters. And activating/deactivating would be great i.e. to check, if web pages I work on work well with fonts being installed or not.  So basically I need a font manager, that supports me for developing websites.  <answer28029> Font Case is the app you are looking for. It has activation/deactivation, web preview mode, glyph overviews, collections etc.  <comment32088> Could you be more specific in your requirements? Any reason not to use Font Book? <comment34450> Does it work with Google Web Fonts?
