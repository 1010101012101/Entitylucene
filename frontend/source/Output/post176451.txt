Cannot drag an app from Launchpad to trash <body> I recently had an app called ZipCloud appear in my Launchpad applications - overtime I drag it to trash, it simply goes back. How do I delete it?  The page http://support.zipcloud.com/question/110/how-do-i-uninstall-zip-cloud says to drag to trash  Why do some things not go into trash?  <answer176452> Managed to delete it by opening the Applications folder in Finder and right clicking and selecting 'Move to trash'  The dragging operation is obviously different to the 'Move to trash' option in some way  <comment363613> No error messages. Thanks Apple!
