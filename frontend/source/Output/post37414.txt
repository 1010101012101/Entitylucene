How can I disable the suspend to disk function on my MacBook Pro <body> Whenever I close the lid of my MacBook Pro it takes over a minute to write out my memory to disk. This is part of the Mac's emsafe/em suspend option, which allows it to restore your memory from the hibernation file if the Mac loses power (say you change batteries or they go flat) while it is asleep.  I prefer my machine to go to sleep as soon as possible and am willing to take the risk of an unclean shutdown should my battery go flat.  A long time ago I disabled this behavior, but have recently reinstalled my machine and OS X has reverted to the default behavior.  How can I disable the hibernation action when I close the lid?  <answer37415> To disable Safe Sleep:  precode$ sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 $ sudo nvram "use-nvramrc?"=false /code/pre  Further details can be found at http://www.normalesup.org/~martinez/macosx/, Including how to enable it again.  <answer37416> I use the SmartSleep preference pane.
