No SIM card installed message all of a sudden <body> I have an iPhone 3G. I have been using it since the past 7 months. Recently, it started showing a 'No SIM card installed' message.. The SIM works well on other phones. The weird thing is, another SIM works fine on the same iPhone ... Someone please suggest a soluton asap..
