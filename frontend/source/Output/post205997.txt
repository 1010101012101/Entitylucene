How do I delete them?  <answer206010> Connect the phone to iTunes and then deselect photo sync and then sync the phone. iTunes will remove all those photos   <comment248391> It cannot be random. It might be something you've set to sync through iTunes. Check with the iTunes during the syncing process under photos.
