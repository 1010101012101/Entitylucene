Perform restore without update? <body> I want to restore my iPad to factory settings. Its an iPad 2,1 running iOS 8.1:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MmvFH.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when I connect to iTunes and click emRestore iPad.../em, I get the message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/crei1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm not interested in 8.1.3, which is what a emRestore and Update/em would result. In fact, I need to keep the iPad at 8.1.2 or lower due to operational requirements. So iOS 8.1 is fine by me.  How do I perform a restore without updating?  <answer172173> If you still have the .ipsw file, press the Option key, then click Restore iPad. Navigate to the file and select it, and iTunes will use that for the restore.   <comment221934> No luck... I forgot to get the backup (or the IPSW signed). Its too bad Apple lied to me about the ability to revert/restore. I would not have allowed the upgrade if the information they provided was accurate.
