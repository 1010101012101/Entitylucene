Remove last login message but keep motd in terminal? <body> Does anyone know a way to stop the "last login" message from showing up when I start up the terminal, but still have the MOTD show up?  I tried touch ~/.hushlogin, but that prevented both from showing.  <answer254696> You are halfway there. Use .hushlogin and add cat /private/etc/motd to the first line of your shell's login rc file.  <comment317091> Awesome, thank you!
