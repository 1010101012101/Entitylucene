How can I split a movie into sections? <body> I have a DVD that somebody recorded and burned for me, and the DVD has no chapter markers.  I ripped it to a MP4 file with Handbrake so I could put it on my iPod/iPad, but I also want it to have "chapters" like a DVD, so I can skip to the parts I want.  Is there an easy way to do this?  I didn't see an option in Handbrake (it seems to be ripping only), or in iTunes.  Can iMovie help me here?  Is there a cheaper/easier way?  It doesn't have to be exact, or terribly easy to use.  I'm perfectly willing to just provide a list of MM:SS points (there's only 4 or 5).  <answer112443> I haven't used it personally, but it looks like Subler will do what you want.   Here is the proper format you need to use for the chapter file: https://code.google.com/p/subler/wiki/ChapterTextFormat     Subler will allow you to add chapters. You just need to drag and drop a   text file in the right format into Subler. You don't write them in in   the Subler GUI.      The Subler site explains the format. It took a lot of trial and error   for me to get it right and it is time consuming so I haven't done it   in a while. Otherwise, I'd tell you how I did it.      Once you add the file, you will have a new row under the Video Track   and Stereo rows called Chapter Track. You can edit the Titles in there   if you want to, but if you created the file correctly, you shouldn't   have to.   http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=901354
