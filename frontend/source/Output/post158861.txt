How to set a custom icon inside a signed Apple Script application? <body> I'm using Apple Script to distribute a signed applet, and would like to use a custom icon. However, as soon as I export it from Script Editor, the bundle loses the custom applet.icns file I put in it. It's reverted to the standard script icon (see screenshot).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vz3Dh.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I export my script as an app without losing my custom icon?  If not possible: are there other ways to sign an Apple Script application bundle on OS X 10.10? This would allow me to do a manual icon replacement and sign the bundle afterwards.  strongImportant twist/strong: Replacing the applet.icns file afterwards is not an option, as the bundle won't pass signature validation anymore. In short, users get a damaged app error when launching the app, unless they have lowered their OS X security.  <answer158880> You can force codesign after You change bundle content. In strongTerminal.app/strong use something like this:  precode codesign -f -s [identity] /path/to/bundle /code/pre  For more info please read codeman codesign/code.
