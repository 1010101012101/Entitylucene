Cover art disappears on iPod nano 5th gen when tilted to portrait orientation <body> It's the second iPod nano 5th gen I've owned that this is happening on, so I'm starting to wonder if the iPod has something to do with it or if it's possible that the problem comes from my data.  When tilted to portrait orientation, while playing, the album art disappears and is replaced by the default grey notes graphics.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mJeSZ.gif" alt="enter image description here"  strongEdit:/strong There seems to be several folders with the same extension in the strongArtworks/strong folder and in the strong.fseventsd/strong folder - is that the reason? Can I remove duplicates without risk?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6uVwR.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAHJP.png" alt="enter image description here"
