Hi, I just bought a new external HDD, It went well on my PC but I can't delete/move files on it from my macbook.  PS. Im running OS X 10.5.8 on my macbook  <answer9241> You need to install 3rd-party software for this, by default OS X just support reading NTFS not writing.  download and install NTFS-3G and MacFUSES.  <comment9858> Possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/447/how-can-i-use-ntfs-partitions
