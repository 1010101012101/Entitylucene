Browsers unable to connect to Internet, other apps can, Parallels can <body> This has been happening in the last few days: Chrome or Safari on the Mac (OSX Lion/10.7.2) are unable to connect to the Internet. Other apps are able to (Dropbox...). I am able to browse through IE on Win7 on Parallels. Terminal is able to codeping/code to codewww.google.com/code.  I first thought it was a problem with Chrome, but Safari and Firefox have the same problem.  I am able to connect to the internet from my wife's laptop (Windows 7) and from my iPhone (over same WiFi network).  This problem gets resolved after I restart the Mac.  What can be wrong?  strongUpdate/strong: When I use the IP address (code173.194.37.50/code for codewww.google.com/code) I am able to reach Google, from Chrome.  But even when I change the DNS to Google DNS, I still get the same issue when I use codewww.google.com/code. (This cannot be a DNS problem anyway right? codeping/code is able to resolve codegoogle.com/code to its IP...)  <answer43209> I suspect a problem with the Parallels network driver, having seen similar issues before.  First, if you haven't already, try updating Parallels to the latest version.  Then, try changing the networking mode to Bridged, or if it already is, to Shared.  Also, here are some generic troubleshooting steps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jT1AQ.gif" alt="Screenshot of Parallels networking dialog"  <comment49100> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/43066/browsing-to-a-nested-subdomain-resolves-wrong-page <comment49158> Trying... but I am not sure whether this would be the root cause. I have Parallels for quite sometime now. <comment51309> It looks like this *was* the problem. After I changed the setting (_Bridged_ to _Shared_), the problem never reoccurred. Thanks! <comment143437> I don't have Parallels and have the exacy same problem.
