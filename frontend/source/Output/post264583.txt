iOS Calendar showing year as 2559 BE <body> My iPhone 5's Calendar shows the year as 2559 BE and I'm unable to change that to the current year.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJkxF.jpg" width="320"  <answer264588> Your phone doesn't actually have the wrong year. It looks like your phone is set to use a Buddhist calendar for some reason. To change it to Gregorian:  Go to Settings  Language &amp; Region  Calendar  Gregorian.  <comment332139> Thanks u so much calender issue is sorted
