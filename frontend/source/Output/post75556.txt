How can I make sure that all songs sync to my iPod? <body> I have a 160GB iPod and it only syncs old music to my iPod.   I buy new songs and it will not sync them. I have probably 150 songs that will not sync (purchased songs). I did run diagnostic and it says iTunes helper is not working. Not sure what that is and not sure if it has anything to do with it.  How can I fix so that all songs sync to my iPod?  <answer76662> Make sure that in iTunes that you have it set to sync your "Entire Music Library":  ol liOpen iTunes*/li liConnect your iPod/li liSelect it in the iTunes sidebar/li liClick the "Music" tab/li liEnsure "Sync Music" is checked/li liSelect "Entire Music Library"/li /ol  *This assumes you are running a fairly recent version of iTunes.  <comment87729> Did you try rebooting your computer and restarting iTunes? Are you running OS X or Windows? Where did you purchase the songs from, in which format (MP3, AAC, WAV) are they?
