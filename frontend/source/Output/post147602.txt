Outlook for Mac - Missing ribbons <body> Today I was about to send an email when I've noticed that on the Compose screen most ribbons were missing. Ribbons like 'Insert', 'Table' (IIRC), were just not there. All I got was a super simple compose window with a handful of formatting options.  Do you know how can I re enable all the lost formatting tools?  emCurrent Compose Window, note how many formatting options are not present/em img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vrmXN.png" alt="Current Window"  Thanks!  <answer147609> To add the Ribbon on/off to your Tool bar right click on it and select "Customize Toolbar".  In the new window, drag the Ribbon to your Tool bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LXhuT.jpg" alt="ribbon"  The ribbon you are showing is already the standard version on MS Outlook 2011.  It can not be further customized, unlike the other MS office products.
