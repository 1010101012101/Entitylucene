Calendar Not Showing events <body> I updated my iPhone 4 to iOS 7 and now my calendar is not working.  When I try to put an event in and press done it does not show in the phone's calendar, but it does show in the iCloud calendar.  <answer123433> Alan R, I think your sync is broken.  Taken from this article : http://email.about.com/od/googlecalendartips/qt/Sync_Google_Calendar_and_iPhone_Calendar.htm  I think you should sync a Google Calendar with iPhone Calendar, it works best!     Make sure you have no conflicting iCal, Exchange or Outlook calendars with which to synchronize. iPhone Calendar can only sync with one calendaring source.   Go to Google Sync in iPhone Safari.   Tap your iPhone under Manage devices.   Make sure all calendars you want to sync are checked.   Tap Save.   Press the Home button.   Tap Settings on the Home screen.   Go to Mail, Contacts, Calendars.   Tap Add Account... under Accounts.   Choose Microsoft Exchange.   Enter your Gmail address under Email.   Enter "m.google.com" (not including the quotation marks) under Domain.   Tap your full Gmail address under Username.   Enter your Google Calendar password under Password.   Optionally, tap "Google Calendar" under Description.   Tap Next.   Enter "m.google.com" under Server.   Tap Next again.   Make sure Calendars is ON.   Turn ON Mail to enable push Gmail in iPhone Mail.   Turn ON Contacts only if you have copied your existing contacts to Gmail. Otherwise, your existing iPhone contacts will be replaced with your Gmail address book contents.   Tap Done.   <comment144083> is your sync broken ? <comment144164> did not do it this way but followed the basic structure and it worked!!
