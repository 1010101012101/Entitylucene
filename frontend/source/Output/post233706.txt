Can I remove BootCamp HFS+ driver <body> So, I have an iMac 27" Late 2012, and I have just installed Windows 10 Home 64Bit through BootCamp. BootCamp comes along with several "support software", useful drivers made for Windows and Apple hardware. I have recently noticed that one of the drivers mounts and makes read-and-writeable drives that are formatted in HFS+, including my Mac drive (which appears read-only) and an external HDD I make backups to. Since I'm afraid of Windows Ransomware, I'd like to remove any access to HFS+ drivers from Windows side of things. Is there any way to remove (or at least disable) the driver that enables HFS+?  <answer233719> AFAIK the Apple HFS+ drivers are read-only. You may have installed another read/write driver like Paragon.  To remove Apple HFS+ Driver:  ol liBrowse to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\/li liMove AppleHFS.sys &amp; AppleMNT.sys to the Recycle Bin/li liCreate a emRemove_AppleHFS.reg/em file with a text editor like NotePad and the following content:  precodeWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00  [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\AppleHFS]  [-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\AppleMNT] /code/pre  You may have to add a trailing empty line.   Merging a reg file with the registry should work as following:  ul liClick on Start and then Run.../li liType in regedit, and then press OK/li liIn regedit, click on File, and then Import/li liEnter the filename or otherwise locate the ".reg" file you want to enter, and press OK/li liThe contents of that ".reg" file will be entered into the registry./li /ul/li liRestart /li /ol  <comment285668> Thanks for the reply. Can you please explain how I can Merge it with Windows registry (I never used Windows before, only GNU/Linux and Mac). Also, doing so am I REMOVING the driver or making a kind of "script" to DISABLE it? <comment285669> @alex2003super Moving AppleHFS.sys & AppleMNT.sys to the Recycle Bin and emptying it removes the files. Removing the reg entries is the clean-up work to delete unknown reg entries. <comment285702> paste that code into a file in notepad and save it with a .reg extension. Then double click on it to apply the changes to the registry. <comment285717> Oh. Thanks! So it's just this simple! <comment286178> And, what do you mean by "trailing empty line"? <comment286180> @alex2003super Some files need a new empty line to work properly. But I can't show this properly because empty lines at the end of a code section are just suppressed in the presentation here!
