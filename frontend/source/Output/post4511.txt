How can I extract the audio from a video file? <body> I have a video of a music performance that I downloaded online, and want to extract the audio so that I can store it as a music file. It's a MOV file with the Codecs - "XVID, MPEG Layer 3." What software should I use for best results?  <answer4517> I can't tell you about strongbest/strong results, but for some results:  h3VLC, FFMPEG, or MPLAYER/h3  VLC has a GUI and a Wizard. ffmpeg and mplayer example here.  <answer4519> If it is a codeMOV/code file which you can open with QuickTime Player, open it QuickTime Player 7, an optional install in Snow Leopard, and then go to codeFile -&gt; Export/code, and choose Sound to AIFF for instance. The resulting AIFF file can me converted back to MP3 or AAC with iTunes, for instance.  <answer18563> Wound up using Audio Hijack Pro for this, was incredibly simple.  <comment4365> Looks like I need Quicktime Pro for this, as File - Export is grayed out and there is a PRO label next to it. <comment4420> I see. I don't have QTPro, and it works for me; I discovered it's because I have one of the Pro Apps (http://www.apple.com/pro/), which seems to unlock QTPro'd features. <comment18471> mankoff, with VLC, I don't see a way to exclude the video. Even if you don't choose the option to transcode the video, it will be included in the output in its original format. Am I missing something?
