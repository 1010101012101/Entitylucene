Can't Download Mavericks via App Store nor Upgrade from OS X 10.8.5 -- Command Line Installs Not Supported <body> App Store mentions the following message when I attempt to download/install OS X Mavericks (10.9):  precode"Command line installs of OS X are not supported on systems older than 10.9." /code/pre  So it says I need 10.9 in order to upgrade to 10.9?  ul liMac mini (Late-2012)/li liOS X 10.8.5 (12F45)/li liiTunes 11.1.2 or above (so far)/li liusing App Store 1.2.2 (129.16)/li /ul  Q: How can I download the OS X Mavericks 10.9 installer?

I had added that line several months ago in order to install something, and had forgotten about it.

Your Mac might re-download Mavericks directly but more likely would re-download the version that created the Recovery HD.  At that point, you would leave your internal drive untouched and install a clean system on the external drive.  From there, you would be able to boot off that external drive that doesn't have the new iTunes and download Mavericks. Once you had the installer, you could run it against either the internal drive or the external drive and migrate data over if you chose to upgrade the external to Mavericks first.  <answer112055> in case this is still an issue  https://discussions.apple.com/message/23816172#23816172  <answer120173> The code/etc/launchd.conf/code file had the following environment variable set:   codesetenv COMMAND_LINE_INSTALL 1/code  which I removed/commented out with a code#/code in front.  (The line was added months before to install an application but not removed).  Note: This post also helped me find / remember where environment variables are stored: https://stackoverflow.com/a/588442/2533809  The upgrade when very smoothly, I'm now running Mavericks 10.9.  <comment127060> Does the installer even download? It should be located in your `/Applications` directory after it downloads. Is it there? <comment127064> It appears the App Store does not allow the download to start.  (In `/Applications`, it's not there). <comment127581> I'm actually using a headless Mac-mini over Screen Sharing / VNC. <comment131632> *I'm actually using a headless Mac-mini over Screen Sharing / VNC.* ... Perhaps that is related to the "command line installs" problem...
