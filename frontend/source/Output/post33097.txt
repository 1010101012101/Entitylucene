How to change the default gateway of a Mac OSX machine <body> I am familiar with the route add default gw command in Linux to add a default gateway, but this doesnt work on Mac OS. I cant find any appropriate example in the route manual. Can anyone help me the command.  <answer33098> route delete default  route add default 192.168.0.1  or  route change default -interface $INTF  route change 192.168.0.0/16 -interface $INTF  <answer33099> If you are intent on using coderoute/code the man page for route will show you it's the same as most BSD route commands. You may need codeip6config/code (and man page) as well if you care about IPv6 routing.  The "mac" way is to set it from the System Preference pane under network and is preferred over using unix commands since it honors location changes and other events such as a reboot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WUKxL.png" alt="manual TCP/IP configuration"  <answer277161> Go to System Preference  Network, and you can "Set Service Order" of the network interfaces and effectively change the default route order in the routing table.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Ghyf.png" alt="change default route ordering"  <comment37791> Or how to make the IP address of one interface the default gateway? <comment186355> is it possible to bind a route to a network environment ? <comment214935> But in that very screenshot, you will get an error message if you press "OK" since this method also require you to set a manual IPv4 Address, which might not be desirable. <comment214941> @Fuzzy76 Yes - if you manually set an unworkable network, your network will not work. The Router here is fine though since that is the default gateway equivalent to [the answer on how to change things from the command line](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/33098/5472). <comment299583> What if you have multiple routes? Eg one straight to the internet and one via a VPN - How would you tell it to route all traffic over the VPN? <comment299585> @Basic Set the VPN interface to be the default route. Then traffic to subnets that have other interfaces will still go elsewhere, but by default - everything else goes to the VPN. If you need _everything_ to be VPN, disable the other network interfaces.
