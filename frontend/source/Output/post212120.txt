iPhone 4s can't be detected by iTunes <body> I'm connecting it to my laptop which is Windows 8 and I got the latest version of iTunes and is running on iOS 9.0.2, it was able to detect it at first then after a while it just suddenly stopped detecting it and the weird thing is it only detects it for a brief moment when I turn off my phone. I've completely uninstalled and re-installed iTunes and it still doesn't work.  <comment256127> Does one of the answers in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/97851/why-does-itunes-not-recognise-a-plugged-in-iphone-on-windows-8-1 help?
