What does this keyboard shortcut symbol indicate? <body> The following was taken out of Photoshop. But I have seen many applications showing the symbol on the left as part of a keyboard combination. Which key is it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gLQ4D.png" alt=""  kbd[Something]/kbd + kbdCommand &#8984;/kbd + kbdO/kbd  Something is?  <answer55210> It's the alt/strongoption/strong key.  Think of it as a strongswitch/strong in circuit diagrams.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wrQdw.gif" alt="enter image description here"
