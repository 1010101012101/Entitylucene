Switch profile of current Terminal <body> Is there a way to switch the profile of an already-opened Terminal window? Let's say I already have a Terminal window opened with Basic profile. Can I switch it to Grass profile?  I seem to only be able to change profiles if I open a new Terminal window.  <answer192973> You can change the profile of an active window by doing the following:  ul liRight click in the open space of the Terminal window (or kbdcmd/kbd+kbdI/kbd)/li liChoose "Show Inspector"/li liClick on the "Settings" header in the Inspector window/li liChoose a new profile for the current window/li /ul  <comment229828> exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
