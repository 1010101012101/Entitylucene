Detecting malware in panic reports <body> Is there a way to identify kernel modules that shouldn't be there out of a panic report? For example, looking at this discussion https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2778885, there it was pretty obvious as "elmedia" was easily identifiable.  However, when looking at mine, there are some things which seem fairly common but I don't seem to be able to find any information about them in internet. For example, in my report I have a couple of (suspicious?) national instrument drivers called ni488k.   I think these logs give a good insight to detecting possible malware. The question is, how can I know which kernel modules should be there and which ones shouldn't?   <answer141917> Short answer is no — you have no guarantee that the malware hasn't removed a seldom-used genuine Apple kernel module and given itself the same name.  Malware is very good at hiding — often compromised Unix systems (such as OS X) get custom versions of system utilities that won't show the malware (see slides 39-41 here).  <answer143103> A panic report isn't the right tool to investigate malware.  ol liMany crashes are coming from commercial and not evil conceived pieces of software. Some of them are coming from MacOS X directly. Crash doesn't mean malware./li liMost of the time you can't reproduce these crashes at will./li liTo hide their tracks, most crapware will change their name as soon as activated./li liIf the crapware wasn't active at the time of crash, their won't be any usefull information in a crash report./li /ol  hr The right tools to investigate for malware are :  ol liTools to detect any system abnormal activity:  codeActivity Monitor/code  codetop/code  codenetstat/code  Little Snitch  This command will show any program which might attempt to penetrate your firewall:  codetail -f /var/log/appfirewall.log/code  .../li liTools to detect abnormal components of the system:  codekextstat/code  this command searches for all recent setuid bit files:  codefind / -mtime -7 -perm +04000 -ls/code  tripwire  clamav, ClamXav  chkrootkit  .../li /ol  hr  If finally you think something is suspicious within a panic report, try to investigate it with the above methods on the system alive. To check which modules should be there use codekextstat/code. Save a copy of its output, check another day, check when you install a software asking you for your admin password, check when you notice an abnormal slow down.  <comment167270> Could you post the logs with all personal info removed?
