MacBook Pro not following network preferences priority <body> I have a macbook pro, retina with force touch, 15" running the latest version of el capitan. I've had this problem for a while actually:  My macbook connects to my ISPs hot spot, over any other wifi connection available, emevery damn time/em, I've already set my network order preferences, under System Preferences  Network  Advanced  Wifi, and have my home network as the first wifi network, all the way on the top, and all the other private networks that I'd rather connect to in the middle, and at the very bottom I have xfinity wifi.   But whenever I change where I am/leave the house (say I go to university and head home), when I got to university, my computer doesn't connect to my university wifi, it connects to xfinity wifi, and I have to manually connect it to my university wifi, and when I come home, it connect to xfinity wifi and I have to again, manually connect it to my home wifi. Sometimes it'll connect to xfinity when its at home and already connected to my home wifi, if it idles for long enough... I don't know why it does this.   I already read the answers on this question, and I've done what the first answer says (I did that when I first got my wifi, within the first month), and the second answer doesn't make much sense to me, as I can't find a downloaded profile, and I never was prompted to update my xfinity wifi when connecting to it.  <comment310134> How about just removing it? <comment310144> @IronCraftMan because there are times when I need to use it, in public places <comment310828> I THINK the Mac will switch no matter your priority if ones reception is better (I don't know by how much) than the other <comment311131> @KevinGrabher I thought that as well. But my home network is always 3 bars, and xfinity is always 1-2 bars. :(
