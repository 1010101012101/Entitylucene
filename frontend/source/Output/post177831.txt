Is a bootable USB drive with Yosemite OK for different macs? <body> This might be obvious, but probably worth a question: I took my MBP (Early 2011 15"), downloaded Yosemite and created a bootable USB device from which I later clean-installed the OS.  Can I use this same USB device with a different MBP (i.e., Late 2011 13"), or do I have to download the installer again from emthat/em macbook app store?  I got worried for a second thinking that it might need different drivers, or something like that. Second MBP does not even belong to me, so it will be used with a different Apple ID (i.e., different from the one through which I got my Yosemite).  <answer177835> The Yosemite Installer package contains all the divers for all supported models.  You are good to go for multiple uses on multiple systems.  <comment210461> Yes it is god to go as many times as you need it. <comment210464> @Buscar웃 - well, it's maybe not ***that*** good, but it should be good to go :p <comment210467> @Tetsujin it is a Sunday :) <comment210469> Having had two similar comments, I trust you enough to accept yours @Buscar (as soon as you post it as an answer) :) <comment210499> @Buscar웃 - it was *god* enough for me to +1 :p
