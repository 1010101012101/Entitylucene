How do I stop MacAppStore from showing updates for deleted apps? <body> I've deleted apps that were purchased through the Mac AppStore. I used "CleanApp" to delete the parts left in app support folders.  But I still see notifications of updates in the AppStore app.  I know I can hide the app name in the Purchases tab, but is there any way to remove these notifications permanently?  It is not just a cosmetic thing. If I have multiple updates and I select "Update All Apps",  the deleted apps will be reinstalled.  Please note I am asking about the Mac App Store, not the iOS Store.  <answer65708> Usually this is a problem with spotlight.  The simplest step is to shut down the mac, disconnect all external drives, and start up to make sure no extra volumes are mounted. The next step would be to rebuild the spotlight index.  Lastly, search in other user accounts to be sure another user didn't somehow install or copy that App into their home folder.  <answer108241> I had the same problem and suggest you try a more relaxed solution.  Instead of spending considerable time on rebooting and rebuilding indexes, use spotlight to search for the application. Select "Show all in finder", throw all instances in the garbage can and empty it.  <answer123919> Thanks for your tips An eventual solution: I searched for other instances of some apps, found a copy on another disk, but since I didn't want to totally delete it, I instead zipped it and then deleted the app. Quite obvious, maybe, but... The annoying update alerts are gone.  <answer157151> Loading the metadata plist works when Mac App Store shows updates for uninstalled apps:  strongTurn off spotlight:/strong  precodesudo mdutil -a -i off /code/pre  strongUnload it:/strong  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  strongLoad It:/strong  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist /code/pre  strongTurn on spotlight again:/strong  precodesudo mdutil -a -i on /code/pre  Now everything is reindexed and there shouldn't be any updates for uninstalled apps.  <answer158353> All you have to do to solve it is the following:  ol liRight-klick on Your App and click codeShow Package Contents/code/li liNavigate to codeContents/_MASReceipt//code/li liOpen the file codereceipt/code in text edit/li liSearch (kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF/kbd) for "angry"/li liDelete the whole paragraph, containing codecom.NAMEofYOURproblemAPP/code/li liSave. Since you donÂ´t have permission to edit system files, you will have to save the new receipt file somewhere else, then replace the old one with the edited after entering your password./li liDone/li /ol  <comment77027> Eject all your disks to ensure spotlight isn't seeing the application on another partition or volume. The App Store uses spotlight, so you could also search here about rebuilding that database in case it's not the apps themselves and instead the index. <comment77037> ah thanks.. I do have a backup drive and TM drive. I will reindex spotlight. If it works, can I mark this as the correct answer? <comment77038> It would be best for you to add whatever answer works for you. You're doing the testing and I just had an idea for you to try (or two). Comments can be voted, but not selected as an answer or migrated to become one. <comment77045> ok. i will likely test this overnight, as I dont want to unmount my drives during the day.. I really appreciate the idea! <comment77295> Thanks bmike. Finally got around to reindexing without the other drives. Your solution was spot on. <comment126900> Great idea.
