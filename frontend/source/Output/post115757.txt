Use mac display separate from the computer? <body> I have a Mac with a relatively nice display. Is there some way to hook an external device (PS4 in this case) and use the monitor as the display for the PS4?  <answer115758> If it's an iMac 21"/27", yes you can use it as a display with the so called Target Display mode.  You can enable it using the kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF2/kbd keyboard shortcut !   <comment135440> Do i need to perform that when the computer is booting, or just any time? And I obviously need an HDMI to Thunderbolt converter? <comment135441> @iKiel2012 According to the linked support doc, you activate this after the computer has booted. And yes, you would need an [HDMI to Mini DisplayPort adapter](http://amzn.to/1dq8yqZ). <comment135442> Of note: the 21" models did not support TDM until 2011.
