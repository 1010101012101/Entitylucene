Remove dropbox icon from Finder toolbar <body> The dropbox icon keeps reappearing in my finder toolbar, no matter how many times I Command Drag it off, or remove it in customize toolbar.  How can I get rid of this annoying button that keeps coming back? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6D0m1.png" alt="Toolbar with Dropbox icon"  The solution in this one answer does not solve my issue as the button is removed, but as soon as I open a new finder window it is back.  I am running OS X 10.10.2 (14C81f) with Dropbox 3.0.3.  <answer166243> In Dropbox preferences, uncheck strongEnable Finder Integration/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zl8PT.png" alt="Enable Finder Integration"  <comment193662> beta OS & out of date app, either could be responsible. Works fine for me on 10.10.1 & 3.0.4
