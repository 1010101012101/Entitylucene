If I buy an iPhone app will I have to re-purchase the app if I get a new iPhone? <body> I upgraded from the 3G to the iPhone 4 and forgot to backup and transfer my apps. If I attempt to purchase apps that I have previously purchased, will the Apple store charge me? Or will it recognize that I have already purchased the app based on my apple ID?  <answer3126> according to the caliban answer on SU:  To re-download all your apps into iTunes.  precode   1. First you need to authorize your iTunes. (Store &gt; Authorize Computer)    2. Next, check for available downloads (Store &gt; Check For Available Downloads) /code/pre  iTunes will then check for what you have purchased before, and give you an option to re-download your purchased apps.  To see a listing of all the apps you have purchased or downloaded, do this :  precode   1. Go to Store &gt; View My Account    2. Login    3. Click on "Purchase History" /code/pre  You should now see all the apps you have downloaded before  <answer3127> No, you will not be charged. You can re-download them in iTunes or directly on the phone. You'll have to hit the "buy" button, but after it starts downloading, you should see a message saying you already bought it once. The alert box includes a button to go ahead and re-download the app, which you will then not be charged for.  <comment4314> Just make sure you use the same iTunes account that you use(d) for the old phone! If you use a different account, then you will be charged again!
