iCal with Google CalDAV issues <body> I currently have iCal syncing to one Google account with 1 main calendar and 3 sub-calendars (selected on Delegation tab). Let's say that this account is codeexample@gmail.com/code.  This is the only one account set up in iCal.  Additionally I have 4 email accounts defined in Mail.app in this order:  ol licodeexample1@example.com/code/li licodeexample2@example.com/code/li licodeexample@gmail.com/code/li licodeexample3@example.com/code/li /ol  hr  h3Problem 1 - iCal will not send out invites to attendees/h3  I cannot make iCal send invites when creating an event within a calendar that's synced with Google.  I have to create a local calendar on Mac, create an event there - invites are sent out "correctly" (see Problem 2), then I simply move the event from one calendar to another and this seems to do the trick.  This seems to be a bit troublesome though (obviously, really). Is there anything I can do to make it work properly - so the invites are sent out from Google's CalDAV calendar?  hr  h3Problem 2 - iCal invites email addresses/h3  iCal seems to be totally inconsistent with using email addresses when sending invitations.  Consider the setup:  ul li1 CalDAV account in iCal (codeexample@gmail.com/code),/li li1 local calendar (as mentioned in Problem 1),/li li4 email accounts in Mail (as described above)./li /ul  Now iCal seems to be sending invites using the topmost email account set up in Mail.app - in this case codeexample1@example.com/code. Is there a way to use different email account to do this?  Also, it seems that iCal creates invites using the email account defined in iCal accounts - in this case codeexample@gmail.com/code, even though I use local Calendar and not the CalDAV one!  This means that invite is sent from codeexample1@example.com/code, but people replying to invites send them back to codeexample@gmail.com/code. This really is plain wrong. Any way to sort it out?  strongNOTE/strong: Ideally I'd like iCal to send invites from the second Mail account - codeexample2@example.com/code.  <answer9784> Someone needs to read the help files on google's page... Just because you've sync'd your google cal w/ ical doesn't mean you can go &amp; send invites to anyone willy nilly. Have you told google that your going to "share" your cal w/ this other person who may or may not have a google account? Did they accept your ical share? As far as "sending out" invites, that'll happen off your "default" email account. Generally iCal will send out a "link" to your event &amp; lots of people just click on that to go to a page where they "accept" or "deny" or "reply" to your invite, so auto received from your gmail account. You could set up a rule to forward them to your other email account if you prefer?  <answer13641> iCal doesn't send invitations - Google Calendar do.  You need to set up Notifications for each Google Calendar - main and sub-calendars.  precode"Google Cal-&gt;Calendar settings-&gt;Calendars-&gt;[select calendar]-&gt;Notifications-&gt;[set check mark at Email and/or SMS for each type of invitations]" /code/pre
