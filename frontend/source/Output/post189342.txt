Can I connect more than one external monitor with only one thunderbolt port? <body> This is my iMac...  System: Mid-2011 iMac - 21.5in  CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600S CPU @ 2.80GHz  RAM: 8.00 GB  Right now, I connect an external monitor to my iMac using the one thunderbolt port that I have. Is it possible to connect a second external monitor? If so, how?  James  <answer189346> thunderbolt dock will do it.  get one that adds dvi, hdmi or passthrough thunderbolt.  my caldigit does hdmi + passthrough thunderbolt so i can get 2 displays on there.  <answer189347> As per venicejeff's comment, exactly.  Although I am not using multiple monitors on my new Macbook Pro 15" (2015), I purchased CalDigit's ThunderStation 2 model. That product connected to your iMac will provide support for thunderbolt / mini displayport passthrough as well as an HDMI port.  So, you should be able to connect 2 external monitors to your iMac via this device. = http://goo.gl/9qDPWL  <comment224522> Hi Jerry, this information may be better included as additional sourcing/product referral to the existing answer left by venicejeff, which already recommends the product as a valid answer. Thank you, though, for the followup and research! <comment224597> OK.  Not a problem. Cheers.. <comment228177> You need to be sure you don't confuse Thunderbolt with Mini Display Port...  If you are using a thunderbolt display then yes you can daisy chain into the back of the other monitor.  However in all likelihood you are using a normal HDMI/DVI/VGA monitor with a Mini Display Port adapter, this is not daisy chain-able with any kind of adapters.  You can however get USB, and Thunderbolt accessories that create virtual monitors, these can likely do what you want but I am not sure if the video from them is accelerated by the graphics card or done in software. Nor how many you can have.
