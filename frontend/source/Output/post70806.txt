Does Do-Not-Disturb mode silence your phone's alarms? <body> If I turn on Do-Not-Disturb, will it also silence my phone alarms?  <answer70807> emSimply put:/em No, it does not.  I suppose this prevents an alarm not going off when you really need it to (i.e. waking you up).  <answer70821> This is from Apples website:     Turn on Do Not Disturb to suppress all incoming calls and notifications. Enable it  manually or schedule a recurring time. Or allow calls from your favorites or specific contact groups.   <comment82232> what's preventing you to check this? <comment82334> That doesn't seem to help? <comment82335> same thing that prevented you.  You could have made easy points @casey_miller! <comment82388> I prefer showing how to solve problems rather than just solve the problems.
