Calendar difference between Outlook on computer vs IPhone 4s <body> When dates are put into my calendar on my computer (in Outlook) the dates are correct but on the calendar in my IPhone 4s they show as a day later. Such as going to see my kids on the 4-7th but on my phone the dates as doing that task show up as 5-8th. What can I do?  <comment57789> How are you syncing?
