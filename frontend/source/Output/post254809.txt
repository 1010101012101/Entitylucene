iPad autofills incorrect information <body> Why does my iPad think I am in another state? When I go to Maps, it shows the correct location. When I want to order something off the internet, it autofills Oregon and I am in California. I did buy a refurbished iPad. Is there a setting I am not finding?  <answer254811> Try resetting your location data.  System Preference  General  Reset  Reset Location &amp; Privacy.  <answer254814> AutoFill data is unrelated to your physical location as it's just stored addresses, phone numbers, etc.  You can adjust or remove AutoFill data under Settings  Safari  AutoFill. Generally it's from a contact card that you have selected as yourself.  <comment317251> If you are using auto-fill and it is filling in information that is not yours, it sounds like the iPad was not set up as new when you purchased it. Was it Apple refurbished? <comment317253> Per the OP, Maps shows them in the correct location, so location tracking is not the issue. The reset you mentioned only clears [permissions for apps to use location](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203033) (i.e. it removes all apps from Settings  Privacy  Location Services and they have to request permission again).
