Can I save some steps when burning same playlist over and over? <body> iMac OSX 10.8.5  I am often producing demo CDs for a musician.  The steps are  ol liinsert blank/li liscroll to playlist /li liright click and choose burn/li liclick ok/li liwait for jingle - this scrolls to the playable CD/li liclick eject/li /ol  repeat  I would like to  ol liscroll to playlist ONCE/li liright click and choose burn /li liget prompted for disks until I am done and click cancel/li /ol  Is there a setting I did not find? I am not interested in 3rd party software - just wondering if there is a setting I overlooked or perhaps some way of automating this.   <answer133261> You should consider buying Toast from Roxio there's a light version on the AppStore that still allows you to choose the numbers of copies...  <comment157931> Thanks, but I was not planning to purchase anything  I was just wondering if there was something I had overlooked. <comment157932> I don't think so what you may do is in the Keyboard System Preferences a shortcut to access the menu item more easily...
