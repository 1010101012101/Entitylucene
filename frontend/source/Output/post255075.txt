Can you remove PDF's after you add them to iBooks? <body> I have iCould sync on. So all my books get sync across my devices. Great!  Now, my question is: can I remove the PDF's (from my Downloads folder) after I added them?    I tried it, it seems to work, but im not sure. Unlike with music you can right click on the book (in iBooks) and click codeShow in Finder/code.  <answer255080> All the books that you move to iBooks stored in  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.BKAgentService/Data/Documents/iBooks/ /code/pre  iBooks make a copy of every books that you move on it.  With iCloud Sync the Documents are stored in the following location - Thanks to @Rogier  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/ /code/pre  Personally I recommend that you make a backup or move your original ebooks on an external drive.  <answer255081> I might maybe differ for certain version of OSX/macOS.   I'm using codemacOS Sierra/code and have iCloud strongon/strong for iBooks.  The files are apparently copied (as dante12 said), but are stored in a different location, for me:  precode/Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents /code/pre  <answer255110> Open iBooks, then choose PDF's in the Navigation Panel at the left. All pdf's are displayed on the right, CTL+click the book you want to delete, then choose "delete".  <comment317623> @date12 thanks, but not for me. I have iCloud sync on? I search  in the Library and found my PDF's in a different location  (?) "/Users/username/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~com~apple~iBooks/Documents/" <comment317624> Thanks I've corrected my answer.
