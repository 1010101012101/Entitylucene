Can the DocSets installed by Xcode be moved to an external disk? <body> While attempting to clean up my Air's SSD, the estimable DaisyDisk showed me that 4 GB is being eaten up by Xcode DocSets. I like keeping my friends close and my SDK documentation closer, so I'd be happiest if I could maintain a copy of these DocSets on an external disk, so they're available offline but not cluttering my SSD.  The DocSets currently exist at code~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/code. Is it possible to move the code.docset/code files themselves to a different location (perhaps symlinking to them) without breaking Xcode's doc viewer?  <answer83925> In Terminal, run  precodemv ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets /Volumes/HDNAME ln -s /Volumes/HDNAME/DocSets ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets /code/pre  This may take a few minutes to complete.
