AppleScript / Shell Script to read 'curl -L' data <body> I have Dropbox file with two lines of data that I'd like to parse into two variables. The following function should have the right logic but doesn't seem to work:  precodeset versionFile to do shell script ("curl -L 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/5eugzgr1alfgsp9/version.txt?dl=1'") set lineDelimiter to read versionFile using delimiter return repeat with oneLine in lineDelimiter     if length of oneLine is greater than 0 then         set variable to oneLine         log "variable: " &amp; variable     end if end repeat /code/pre  strongError:/strongbr codeerror "Canâ€™t make \"1.0.0.2  www.example.com/download-link-here\" into type file." number -1700 from "1.0.0.2  www.example.com/download-link-here" to file/code  Any help is greatly appreciated. Cheers.  <answer265207> As coded, codeversionFile/code is a emvariable/em that contains the contents of the emfile/em not the emfile/em itself and you're using the coderead/code emcommand/em improperly, as it reads data from a emfile/em, not a emvariable/em.  Change:  precodeset lineDelimiter to read versionFile using delimiter return /code/pre  To:  precodeset lineDelimiter to paragraphs of versionFile /code/pre  hr  precodeset versionFile to do shell script ("curl -L 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/5eugzgr1alfgsp9/version.txt?dl=1'") set lineDelimiter to paragraphs of versionFile repeat with oneLine in lineDelimiter     if length of oneLine is greater than 0 then         set variable to oneLine         log "variable: " &amp; variable     end if end repeat /code/pre  hr  Results:  precodetell current application     do shell script "curl -L 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/5eugzgr1alfgsp9/version.txt?dl=1'"         --&gt; "1.0.0.2 www.example.com/download-link-here"     (*variable: 1.0.0.2*)     (*variable: www.example.com/download-link-here*) end tell /code/pre  hr  Since the codeversionFile/code emvariable/em contains the emtext/em contents of the emfile/em, then in this case to work with it, use the emelements/em of emtext objects/em, one of which is codeparagraph/code and in the context defined as:     A series of characters beginning immediately after either the first character after the end of the preceding paragraph or the beginning of the text and ending with either a carriage return character (\r), a linefeed character (\n), a return/linefeed pair (\r\n), or the end of the text. The Unicode "paragraph separator" character (U+2029) is not supported.   <comment332510> As coded, `versionFile` is a _variable_ that contains the contents of the _file_ not the _file_ itself and you're using the `read` _command_ improperly, as it reads data from a _file_, not a _variable_.
