Delete Data URLs from Safari History <body> Safari on my Mac has a strange habit: It saves codedata:/code URLs in the history. That’s pretty annoying because they are long and definitely influence the performance of Safari, especially when typing into the Smart Search Field.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tplx4.png" alt="enter image description here"   I tried to searching the history (History  Show History) to delete them but they don’t show up if I search for codedata:/code (instead a lot of unrelated sites show up).  Is there any good way to delete without deleting the whole history?
