Backup keychains from hard drive <body> During the installation of Yosemite, I got locked out due to my hard drive having some errors.  Thankfully I had a Windows partition and am able to access my files.  However, how do I backup my Keychain keys when I only have access to the files?  I am specifically trying to backup my developer private key.  <answer153045> You have two ways to copy the Keychains directory  precodeFinder -&gt; Go -&gt; Go to folder... -&gt; /Library/Keychains /code/pre  or something like  precodecp -r /Library/Keychains ~/Desktop/MyKeychainsBackup [in terminal window] /code/pre  However, the Keychains is saved with iCloud; you don't really need to make a local backup.  <comment180047> it's in ~/Library/Keychains/ though I'm not sure how that would work as a copy via windows. No backup? <comment180402> So my developer private key is going to be backed up with iCloud too?
