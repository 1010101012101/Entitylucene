How can I trigger some automation when my webcam turns on? <body> I work from home and spend a lot of time on video conferencing. It'd be really cool to trigger something, like an "On Air" sign, when my webcam is active. Can I set a program or script to run when the camera activates?   <comment353844> I know you can detect webcam activation, there are some privacy tools (Micro Snitch, Oversight)... I just don't know any that can run scripts.
