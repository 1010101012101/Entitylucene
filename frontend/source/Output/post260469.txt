Can I edit my Music playlist on iTunes? <body> I have an iPhone 5s running iOS 10.0.2.  My iTunes version is 12.5.3.17.  I have synced them together but I cannot see my Music playlist in iTunes.  <answer260473> First, you want to check and see if you are syncing playlists through iTunes.  You can verify that here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JG4jF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  If you have that, your playlists may be in iTunes Cloud library, which you have to enable here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/229zU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment326141> My iPhone's Music page did not have the same set of options in my iTunes.  But the playlist showed up when I enabled iCloud Music Library in General Preferences.  Thanks!
