Apple external Keyboard A1243 does not work properly <body> My Apple external German wired keyboard A1243 does not work properly.  When I press the kbdspace/kbd or kbdm/kbd, it becomes codem/code (space + m).  When I press kbdu/kbd it becomes codeu/code and sometimes code√º/code.  Does anyone know how to solve this issue?  <answer239746> At minimum, your keyboard needs to be cleaned.  More than likely, it needs to be replaced.  Just doing a quick search for your symptoms brings up tons of relevant results in which a majority of the keyboards needed to be replaced.  Some were fixed by a cleaning, but that requires taking the keyboard apart.  But to be certain it is your keyboard and not you computer, just plug the keyboard into another computer; if the problem persists then it's time for a new one.
