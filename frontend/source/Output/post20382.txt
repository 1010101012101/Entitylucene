Celtx unexpectedly quits <body> I am using Celtx for script-writing/movie production. Just earlier today, I used it with no problems at all. Now, when I open it, it bounces 2-3 times, then quits. If I open a Celtx file, the file will open and load, then quit. I can't do anything with Celtx at all. Please help me!  <answer20441> Presuming that you are using the latest version of Celtx, I think that it's most likely that one of the Celtx preference files have become corrupted. You'll find them in two locations:  Preference file:  precode/Users/username/Library/Preferences/ca.greyfirst.celtx.plist /code/pre  Preference folder:  precode/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Celtx /code/pre  I'd do the following to troubleshoot:  ol liQuit Celtx. Not a problem, since you can't open it anyway. /li liMove the above listed files/folders to your Desktop./li liTry to launch Celtx. If things work, great. Celtx will recreate the preferences. You will need to reset any user preferences you made./li liIf things don't work, I'd Trash the application, redownload it, and reinstall./li liAfter reinstalling, restart your computer before you try to open the app again, just in case anything's being cached/li /ol  Oh, and best of luck with your script!  <comment22616> I deleted both the .plist file and the prefs folder. It still doesn't work. I'm pretty sure I've reinstalled it already, but I'll try again. <comment22617> I reinstalled...same problem. <comment22619> Whew...restarted and the application was fine. (I would've restarted earlier, but I had iDVD creating a DVD) Thanks for your help! <comment22641> Done. Glad to help.
