Safari does not let me save pages! <body> Just tried Safari (got advised to save battery power over Chrome) and the "Save As" button is disabled! Can't save a single page!  Any idea why this happens and what I can do against it? Thanks!  EDIT. Safari version 6.1, MacOS 10.8.5  <answer114263> I'm not sure on the emwhy/em but if you use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd, the strongExport/strong dialog pops up as expected (After that, strongSave As.../strong is once again available. Until you reload the page).  I think it's a bug in Safari (I base this on the fact that it's also possible to reactivate strongSave As.../strong by mousing over it in the menu, closing the menu and then reopening it again...)  <answer114264> Ok, I found it - it does not let me save page until it is fully loaded!  Which is painfully slow sometimes, comparing to Chrome. As far as I can see, Chrome still lets me save page even if it is not complete and even when I just started loading it still works with previous page! So I can still save the previous page after mistakenly clicking on a link.  <comment133918> It never gets reactivated for me until page is fully loaded. <comment133919> @DmitriZaitsev True, I didn't think to include that in my reply. <comment133936> Can you please add your Safari version, such that future users know that that certain future have this problem?
