QuickLook stopped working <body> What might cause quicklook to 'freeze', as it were.  quicklook has gone south to some degree, some files are QL-able, other not,  and we're speaking of the apple plug-in type (pdfs, txt, jpg, etc.)  Even whilst running the Topher 'fix', terminal hangs  after either the qlmanage -r or qlmanage -r cache.  Cheers, and thanks in advance for any light  your available time might hereby shed. :)  Running OSX, ver 10.6.6 on an iMac  <answer56867> It is possible that some QL plugins are broken, you should check   precode~/Library/QuickLook/ /Library/QuickLook/ /System/Library/QuickLook/ /code/pre  for new QL plugins (check the date of the files). Maybe a program installed a new (broken) plugin? But some QL plugins are not inside the Library/QuickLook/ folders you can use  precodeqlmanage -m /code/pre  to list all QL plugins, with  precodeqlmanage -m | grep -v com.apple /code/pre  you see only plugins which are strongnot/strong from Apple.  <comment82013> [Is there a way to completely reset / regenerate QuickLook preferences (system-wide)?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/53818/8546) has an accepted answer that might help.
