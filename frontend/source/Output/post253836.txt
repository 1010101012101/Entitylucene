Update from Mac OS X 10.6.8 to the newest version <body> I want to update from Mac OS X 10.6.8 to the newest version which is macOS Sierra. My Mac should be able to run this version of macOS. If I try to download the update on the App Store it fails because I need Mac OS X 10.7 at least.  What can I do to upgrade my Mac?  <answer253840> Here's how Apple says you can upgrade via their macOS upgrade page.  You need to install an intermediate upgrade first.  h2Upgrading from OS X Snow Leopard/h2  If you’re running Snow Leopard (10.6.8) and your Mac supports macOS Sierra, you will need to upgrade to El Capitan from the App Store first. Then you can update to Sierra.   h2Upgrading from OS X Leopard/h2  If you’re running Leopard and would like to upgrade to macOS Sierra, first you’ll need to upgrade to OS X Snow Leopard. You can purchase OS X Snow Leopard from the Apple Online Store. Then upgrade to El Capitan as above, and then to Sierra.  <comment316015> Install 10.7 first (duh?) <comment316121> Try going to the Purchased tab of the App Store and see if you can download it from there. <comment316286> I'd think twice before upgrading, or buy more RAM before you do. How fast is your computer right now, how much RAM do you have, do you have an HDD or SSD? Sierra will probably run significantly slower than Snow Leopard and I'd recommend at least 4GB and an SSD or at least 8GB of RAM. <comment318102> Here is the Apple Support article for installing El Capitan: https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT206886
