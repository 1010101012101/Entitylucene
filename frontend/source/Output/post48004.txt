How to search files from command line under OS X? <body> It seems that Apple doesn't want us to use codelocate/code, at it is making it so hard to setup.  If there a way to use codefinder/code database from the command line? Maybe I can make an alias.  I would appreciate solutions that would not require system reconfiguration, just because I don't want to repeat the process each time I upgrade the system of switch computers.  <answer48007> You could use codemdfind/code, which uses the Spotlight database. More information on this man page.   <comment54965> locate works fine: `sudo /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb` <comment54966> What is so hard? You asked this question and got an answer here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14836/how-to-automate-execution-locate-updatedb-by-using-a-bash-script <comment54967> @mankoff yes, it works as long you are updating its database, and also cron does not work anymore, so you have to install it in launchdâ€¦ so it is much easier to add `alias locate="mdfind"`
