How can I use an iMac + MacBook Pro for fast Twitch streaming? <body> I'm interested in streaming video games at a minimum of 720p/60fps. I've got a Late 2015 iMac and a 2013 MacBook pro (as well as a reasonable Windows desktop PC), but none of these computers have the power to both play in great quality and stream at the same time, unless my iMac OBS Studio setup is seriously wrong.  What's the best way for me to connect these so that I can play on one computer, and stream on another? I have a couple different ideas but don't want to drop money until I know a solution will work perfectly:  ul liCapture card iMac - stream from MacBook (potentially most expensive)/li liThunderbolt to Thunderbolt between Macs and somehow share the screen and sound at hardware speeds/li /ul  Any other ideas/suggestions? I'm not sure if either of these will work  <comment329694> Can you clarify exactly what you're end game is (no pun intended)? Are you wanting to just make your live game play visible from one Mac to the other? Are you wanting to record the live game play happening on one Mac on the other Mac for later editing? Are you wanting to stream your live game play to an audience of viewers? Something else? I guess I'm asking _why_ you want to do this, so we can offer a useful response.
