Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard function keys unreliable <body> I have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard connected to my 2011 MacBook Pro.  The keyboard's normal keys (letters, etc.) always work fine; however, there is a problem with the various function keys.  Basically, they don't work until I go to System Preferences - Microsoft Keyboard. Once I go to that prefpane, everything starts working again.  It seems to somewhat randomly stop working, requiring me to go to System Preferences again to make it work.  How can I fix this? It seems like a daemon/driver that's supposed to make the keys work is crashing, but I searched Console.app for microsoft with no luck.  <answer79621> The reason for this is that strongMicrosoft Keyboard Helper/strong is somehow not being added to the strongLogin Items/strong by the keyboard's driver installer. However, the helper is contained inside the strongMicrosoft Keyboard/strong Preference Pane, so it is being run when you open it, and thus restores the full functionality of the keyboard.  The simple solution is this:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong;/li liGo to strongUsers &amp; Groups  {your user}  Login Items/strong;/li liClick strong+/strong icon under the Login Items list;/li liWhen Finder window opens, press kbd⇧/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbdG/kbd;/li liWhen a form appears, paste this into it:  code/Library/PreferencePanes/Microsoft Keyboard.prefPane/Contents/Resources//code;/li liSelect the file strongMicrosoftKeyboardHelper/strong, and press strongAdd/strong;/li /ol  That's it. The keyboard should now retain its function keys' functionality after the restart.   <answer189880> I also have the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard. In my case the simple solution was to press the codeF Lock/code key at the far right of the function row (left of the codePrint Screen/code button). I didn't realize the button even existed until now.  <comment242549> This is a devilishly subtle issue because the first thing you do to try to fix it (opening the Preference Panel) does indeed fix it until you restart or log out.  I think I've probably wasted hours on this over the years, so many thanks for supplying the, obvious in hindsight, solution. <comment324851> I logged in just to upvoted this :|
