nsurlsessiond downloading 100s GB in a month <body> Is there anyway to know what nsurlsession is downloading? My iCloud Drive is only 30GB. Most of the Apple Music and Photos are already on my Mac. I don't even generate 1GB of Photos or video per month.  And yet nsurlsessiond is downloading 100s of GB of data. This is 10 times more then all the App update, OSX Update and iCloud Data combined !!!  Is this a bug or have i been hacked? I send a support letter to Apple and no response.   <comment263146> You can get some information from Activity Monitor.  Open Activity Monitor and select nsurlsessiond.  Then double click it and select Open Files and Ports. This may not provide all the information you're looking for however it's where I'd start.  Here are a few command line utilities you can use in a Terminal: `fs_usage`, `iosnoop`, `opensnoop` and `dtrace`.  `iosnoop` and `opensnoop` make use of `dtrace`.  You can read the manages on these commands by, `man $command` e.g.: `man fs_usage`
