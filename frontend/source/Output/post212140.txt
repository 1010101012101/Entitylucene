Simple way to disable Cellphone (data & call) without disabling WiFi & Bluetooth on iPhone <body> Airplane mode is fine sometimes - but sometimes I want a quick way to turn off my cell circuits (calls / sms / cell data) - without turning off WiFi &amp; Bluetooth.  And no, I don't want to turn on Flight mode then re-enable Cell &amp; Bluetooth (this is specifically not a duplicate of that question).  I may be playing music on a Bluetooth device, and connected to Wifi - turning those off and on can be extremely disruptive.  Are there any widgets that can do this say? You should be able to customise control centre to do it  Thanks.  <answer212143> I agree you should be able to customise the control centre.  What about keeping the sim card pin gadget on your keyring and popping out the SIM tray a little? Too risky?  <answer212157> Turn on airplane mode, then re-enabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is currently the only option.   You can send feedback to Apple here about wanting the ability to turn of Cellular.  <comment256147> lol nice idea but not really practical.
