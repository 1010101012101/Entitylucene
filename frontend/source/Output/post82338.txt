How to disable Magic Trackpad while typing? <body> Is it possible to get the strongexternal/strong Magic Trackpad disabled automatically while I'm typing?  I do get a lot of cursor movements/clicks when just touching the trackpad accidentally.  <answer82343> If you mean the built-in trackpad, then you cannot disable it. But you can disable it if you connect an external mouse to your Mac.  To do, just open System Preferences  Accessibility (or Universal Access)  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  tick on emIgnore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present/em  You're done.  <comment95012> It is for external Trackpad <comment95027> Magic Trackpad or Built-in Trackpad?
