transferring photo modifications to iPhoto <body> When I transfer photos taken and edited on the iphone (iPhone 6, iOS 8.1.1) to iPhoto (9.6) on my mac (OS X 10.10.1), only the original picute is transferred but not the modifications. Is there a simple way to transfer both the original and the modifications?  Apple recommends to send the edited photos by e-mail but this does not seem a very good solution when you have tons of edited pictures.
