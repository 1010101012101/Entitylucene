Browse to /tmp in file dialog <body> How can I browse to code/tmp/code to select a file in a file dialog window, such as the one Chrome uses to select an attachment? I am aware of how to browse to other folders as explained here. I could probably drag and drop, but I would prefer to simply select the file from a list in the appropriate folder.  <answer128779> In file dialogs you can press kbdCmd-Shift-G/kbd (just like in Finder) to enter the path to any folder/directory you want to open.
