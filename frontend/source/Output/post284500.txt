Resize ubuntu used hard disk on dual boot macbook pro 2015 <body> I have my Macbook pro 2015 dual booted with Ubuntu 14.04.  I don't need the initially allocated memory in my Ubuntu installation anymore. I need to decrease it and allocate it to my macOS.  Is that possible? If yes, how do I go about doing it?  Below is the screenshot of how my disk utility looks like.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UaGvP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment358792> Share screenshot of what you see when you open disk utility <comment359043> @MythicCocoa Added a screenshot.
