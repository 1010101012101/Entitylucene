User send texts from their iphone to my email address. How do i set this up <body> User sends text message to my email account. I receive those messages on my iPad only. I need to receive it through email Office 365  <answer248104> So if I understand your problem correctly, a user is sending iMessages to your Apple ID or email. A feature used to be available to do this (I believe iOS 6 or 7), but I haven't seen anything in the latest iOS. For the older iOS you could go to Settings &lt; Messages &lt; Receive At and choose an email from there.  <comment306202> I don't understand what you're asking.  Please review [How to Ask](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask) for how to ask good questions and increase the chance you'll receive a helpful answer.  - From Review <comment306252> This works in iOS 10 Beta 4. Just as you said, you go into Settings, Messages, Receive At... And I have my cell number and 3 email addresses selected. <comment306255> As it has worked since the feature was introduced. It was never removed. <comment306262> @TMHahn Interesting, I am not able to find this on my iPhone. <comment306264> Go about half way down this Apple document. It was revised June 2016. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204065 <comment306268> @TMHahn This is not what the OP is asking for. The OP wants the messages forwarded to his email inbox. This option is no longer available in settings. <comment306269> Oh, I see. I can't think of a way to do that. Agreed.
