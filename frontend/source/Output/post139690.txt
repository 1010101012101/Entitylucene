Is it possible for a new iPhone 5 to have an expired warranty? <body> So, I am going to buy a new iPhone 5 (not in an authorized apple store, since it's no longer sold there), but when I checked the serial number on the back of the box here, it said that the warranty has been expired. ("Check date" : 21 July 2014)  At the end, I haven't bought it yet.  strongSo, my question is : "Is it possible for a new iPhone 5 to have an expired 1 year warranty?"/strong  Some said that it's because it's been a long time (2 years I suppose?) since the iPhone 5 first released, but I think, as long as it's a real brand new device, then the warranty will never be expired, unless activated before a.k.a second-hand item.  So in this case, I think the shop is scamming by repackaging a used iPhone.  What do you think?  P.S. I never buy an apple device before, so I'm a complete newbie in this thing.  Thanks.  strongEDIT : How can I check whether an iPhone is a repackaged-secondhand-item a.k.a scam or it's a real brand new item?/strong  <comment164650> In which country are you buying the phone? <comment164651> indonesia. but it's either a singapore (more likely) or US item originally. <comment164652> The reason I asked is in some countries e.g. in EU the warranty from the shop is the one that matters so if they say it is new that is when it starts. Also if it is new the Apple warranty should start from when you buy it -, again in EU I would ask the authorities to check the shop <comment164653> so, it's might be the devices which i checked earlier are "repackaged-second" iPhone-s? Or at least, how can I checked whether it's a really brand new, or just a scam? <comment164654> Ask why the warranty does not start from when you buy it  but I think any check depends on the local laws as that is what you have to use if the seller lies <comment164655> They said : "oh it's because we bought it overseas, so we need to check it's hardware functionality, etc".
