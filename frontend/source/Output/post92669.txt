Is there a keyboard shortcut to navigate full screen windows of the same application? <body> Or is there some app that will let me do it. This bug has been forever since Lion. Isn't it about time apple fixed it?  <answer92673> Witch also includes full screen windows, and ⌥⇥ selects the next window from the current application by default.  Or if you use an application that has its own implementation for full screen windows (like WriteRoom), ⌘` usually includes custom full screen windows.  <answer145643> You mean something like ⌘-tab, but restricted to windows of the same application?  I indeed installed Witch in the past for the ⌥-tab option, but don't use it anymore, either.  ul liI am using fullscreen windows a lot, but I am just using ⌘-tab and Ctrl-left/right for navigating between spaces./li liMaybe using tabs within the same full-screen window is another possible workaround (depending on the application)?  E.g. in Safari, [Shift-]Ctrl-tab works, and in Terminal, it's ⌘-}/{/li /ul  <answer145673> Try Contexts for Mac. I replaced the built-in apps switcher with this utility which lets me to view full screen windows including a feature to search active windows by title.  <comment108696> Thanks a zillion. My question is pretty much a dupe of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20883/switch-between-full-screen-windows-of-the-same-application-in-lion but I was looking for solutions and you have given a great one. Thanks much. <comment108718> After trying it a bit, I am not liking it much. :( . I hope Apple will do something about it in the next OS release. <comment171655> You mean to switch between different desktops which are on the fullscreen mode of the same app? <comment171758> Why not use ⌘`? <comment172705> @SridharRatnakumar it does not work with full screen windows of same app. My favorites that I use often - iTerm, IntelliJ or even Firefox, Safari - just open multiple full screen windows of the app. I wish ⌘` would work in those cases as well
