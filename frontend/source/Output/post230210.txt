How to install certificates with Mono on Rootless El Capitan <body> As follow up question for this post:  How do I install global certificates on a Rootless El Capitan for mono?  Mono uses the path code/usr/share/.mono/certs/code, which isn't allowed anymore (see refered post). Does someone knows where I could store those certificates other then code~/.config/.mono/certs/code?  It is not a problem for us to install the certificates in the config folder, but it is a minor annoyance, because all new users on those devices will have to run the installer, instead of only the first user.
