Keyboard shortcut for start dictation from PC keyboard <body> When my laptop is closed at home and I am using a PC keyboard, I cannot access Start Dictation with "fn fn" because there's no fn key on my keyboard. How can I get a keyboard shortcut for this?  I tried setting up Karabiner but was unsuccessful. Instructions appreciated. Could have shift-lock or F9 for my fn key.  Or is there a way to change the keyboard shortcut for this to something else?  I'm on El Capitan (10.11.3). Thanks.  <answer235092> You should be able to easily change the shortcut for Dictation from the codeDictation/code preference pane in codeSystem Preferences/code.     strongChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Dictation &amp; Speech. Turn on Dictation, then choose from these Dictation options:/strong      Choose the keyboard shortcut you will use to signal that you're ready to start dictating.       img src="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/el-capitan-system-preferences-dictation-speech-animation.gif" alt="https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/osx/el-capitan-system-preferences-dictation-speech-animation.gif"   <comment287492> Perfect! I didn't know there were dictation preferences. Thanks :)
