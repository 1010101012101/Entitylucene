Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install? <body> Is it possible to burn a DVD out of the Lion app store install?  <answer17762> Yes http://lifehacker.com/5812997/burn-the-mac-app-store-version-of-os-x-lion-to-a-dvd  <answer17815> Yes!  After you purchase and download Lion from the App Store, the "Install" screen will appear:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MA8DF.png" alt="Mac OS X Lion Install Screen"  Before you click strongContinue/strong, open your strongApplications/strong folder and look for the icon labelled strongInstall Mac OS X Lion/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YhPdX.png" alt="Applications Folder Screen"  If you missed this chance (and the App is deleted from your system), you can always strongre-download/strong the package using the strongApp Store/strong app. Even if it shows Lion Installed, you can hold the kbdoption/kbd key pressed, then press the button to re-download the Lion installer app.  Right-click (or Ctrl+Click) on this and choose strongShow Package Contents/strong. Navigate to strongContents/strong  strongSharedSupport/strong and look for strongInstallESD.dmg/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2TBnx.png" alt="Package contents of the Install Mac OS X Lion package"  Use Disk Utility (in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder) to burn InstallESD.dmg to a DVD. Drag the InstallESD.dmg file to the Disk Utility window, select it, then choose strongBurn.../strong from the Images menu.  A dialog appears allowing you to burn it to a DVD. The name of the DVD doesn't really matter, but I named mine strongMac OS X Lion/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vxfaq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19433> You can copy strongInstall Mac OS X Lion/strong.app — in its entirety — to a DVD that is not bootable.   A widely promoted hack involves using emonly a part/em of the .app for 10.7 (Build 11A511) to create a DVD (or USB flash drive, or external hard disk partition) that is bootable. Bootable media produced in this way from this source may be good for emsome/em uses but please, proceed with caution: other uses may leave a system unusable.   Be aware of the known risks, and unknowns, associated with straying from what is recommended by Apple.   <comment19495> You can also throw it on a bootable USB key: http://osxdaily.com/2011/07/08/make-a-bootable-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-installer-from-a-usb-flash-drive/ <comment19522> Nice tutorial Joel! <comment19526> I have a question. Should I accept Joel's answer because it's "nicer", or should I accept palanijara because it's the first correct answer <comment19539> Please see http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/485/are-answers-that-just-contain-a-link-acceptable <comment19552> Accept the one that solved your problem ;-) I wrote mine because palanijara's depends on an outside link. We generally don't like answers that are just a URL here because essentially you've made a page that doesn't actually answer a question for anyone else who lands there from google, it's just a resting-stop on the way to the real answer. <comment19613> Thanks for the heads up koiyu. I'll post the excerpt next time with the link. Joel already posted detailed answer after my post. <comment20056> @koiyu, Well in fairness, it's not a link only answer, he answers the question with a simple yes and then provides a link. Maybe the answer could use more detail, but it's not a straight link only answer. <comment21440> [Discussion in Ask Different Chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/conversation/home-produced-bootable-media-for-lion-known-risks-and-unknowns-around-10-7-buil) <comment21585> Exactly. This is much faster than using a DVD. <comment21635> What are the risks? You are being very ominous here but I've followed your links and I don't understand what you think might happen. <comment21648> benzado, recently discussed in Ask Different Chat: [home-produced bootable media for Lion: known risks and unknowns around 10.7 (Build 11A511)](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/conversation/home-produced-bootable-media-for-lion-known-risks-and-unknowns-around-10-7-buil) <comment21651> Can you summarize that? I have a hard time following the chat dialogue. It seems like there is some FileVault-related issue but that's it? <comment21652> benzado, the answers may be multiple and complex (more than I alone can answer). I think it would make a good question, if you would like to ask it. Something like 'What risks surround nonstandard uses of .dmg files for 10.7 (Build 11A511)?' … <comment21656> PS sorry for the repeated link. Pale blue text on white background was overlooked. <comment63052> How big is it.  What size USB key would I need for this?
