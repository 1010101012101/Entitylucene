Lock The Dock On Multiple Screen Setup <body> I like all the multiple screen features in Mavericks except one.  I HATE the hit cursor to the bottom of the screen to move the dock. I've searched hi an low for a way to stick the dock to one spot. I'd even buy a product.   There must be a way to say "Dock stick to Screen 2" or 1 or whatever. I have already read that you can go back to the old behavior of multiple screens, but then I loose the other features.   <comment163992> I couldn't agree more. <comment187292> Did you ever get it working? <comment187509> Nope. I looked for a paid solution as well. Someone needs to create this!
