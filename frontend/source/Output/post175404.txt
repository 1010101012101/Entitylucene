iPhone photos sent to iCloud not showing up <body> I have an iPhone 4s with iOS 7.1.2, and I sent some photos I took on the phone to iCloud, via the right-click menu (not sure what that is called). But they do not show up when I log in to iCloud on my Macbook.  iPhone 4S, iOS 7.0.4  <comment206863> When you say you sent them to iCloud, what do you mean? Did you use iCloud Photo Sharing? At this point iCloud Photo Sharing is not available on iCloud.com - only iCloud Photo Library. <comment206937> 'only iCloud Photo Library'â€¦ which requires iOS 8.1 [just to clarify.] See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204264
