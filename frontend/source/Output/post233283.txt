Trying to wake my Mac using Apple / Power Manager Script triggered by Folder Actions <body> I've been trying to tweak the following script to achieve this. (original script)  precodetell application "Power Manager Scripting"  tell workshop      set myEvent to make new event with properties {id:"myWakeEvent", name:"Wake up for work"}      -- Create a daily trigger     make new trigger daily at front of triggers of myEvent with properties {seconds from midnight:(8 * 60 * 60),availability:wake up, days: [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday]}  end tell  -- Deploy the event tell Event Store to store these events myEvent  -- Clean up tell the workshop to empty  end tell     /code/pre  I'm trying to use the Power Manager's  "myWakeEvent" or some kind of WakeEvent to trigger my Mac to wake up. My intention is to place this script into a Folder Action then go from there.  I've tried bypassing all date and time properties but don't know how to structure to create just the simple trigger.   <answer233290> This script works with the latest Power Manager, once the first line is changed to read:  precodetell application "Power Manager" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GPAhz.png" alt="Script Editor"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQwmO.png" alt="Power Manager"  See Power Manager's AppleScript documentation for more examples.

I was trying to pick this script apart to make, just a trigger to wake my mac.  My intention is to send an email to a folder and have that email trigger this script to wake my mac via Folder Actions. If that will even work. I just could not figure out how to make a "wake" command. From what I read Power Management was the only way to go. <comment285144> Will your Mac be asleep when the e-mail arrives? <comment285145> Yes it will, and I've been thinking about this for some many hours now that I forgot just that,, it will be asleep and won't even acknowledge the email until it wakes.. I think I've wasted your time man, sorry.. <comment285243> No problem; good to explore the idea. If you want to try an approach that has your Mac waking at intervals to check for e-mail, that should be possible. <comment285476> I'm actually trying to create commands for my Amazon Echo. I've got it to sleep, restart, shutdown, launch apps, but was trying to find a way to wake it. Can you think of any service or method that would trigger the system to wake short of a scheduled wake or button press? <comment285525> The traditional way to wake a sleeping Mac, without a schedule, is using a Wake On LAN (WOL) network packet. Consider [asking a new question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/ask) to see what others have tried. <comment285644> Yeah, that's the only other method I could think of. Thanks again!!
