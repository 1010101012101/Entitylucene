Recover /private/etc/ssh after accidentally deleting <body> I'm working with macOS Sierra and I have accidentally deleted code/private/etc/ssh/code.  How can I recover this folder so I can use SSH?  The last solution is to reinstall the OS, but I want avoid this.  <answer272230> In my El Captain machine, /etc/ssh contains these files (but some may be leftover from previous OS versions):  precodemoduli                          ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub ssh_config                      ssh_host_key ssh_config~orig                 ssh_host_key.pub ssh_host_dsa_key                ssh_host_rsa_key ssh_host_dsa_key.pub            ssh_host_rsa_key.pub ssh_host_ecdsa_key              sshd_config ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub          sshd_config~previous ssh_host_ed25519_key /code/pre  You may be able to recreate the keys with ssh-keygen. See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/461831 .  I'm not sure what to do about the config files. Perhaps someone with a pristine Sierra installation can share those with you.  <answer272231> The contents of strong/private/etc/ssh/ssh_config/strong in Sierra is as follows:  precodeHost *         SendEnv LANG LC_* /code/pre  The contents of strong/private/etc/ssh/sshd_config/strong in Sierra is as follows:  precodeAuthorizedKeysFile  .ssh/authorized_keys UsePAM yes AcceptEnv LANG LC_* Subsystem   sftp    /usr/libexec/sftp-server /code/pre  You can use ssh-keygen to create keys as per lhf's answer.  <answer272249> After deleting your ssh folder and strongno/strong backup you can reinstall some content using the macOS installer and recreate the keys yourself:  The default content of /private/etc/ssh in El Capitan or Sierra are these files:  precodemoduli                          ssh_host_ed25519_key ssh_config                      ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub (ssh_config~orig)               ssh_host_rsa_key ssh_host_dsa_key                ssh_host_rsa_key.pub ssh_host_dsa_key.pub            sshd_config ssh_host_ecdsa_key              (sshd_config~previous)             ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub           /code/pre  Three of the files are part of the macOS installer and can be extracted and installed from the Sierra OS X Install ESD with Pacifist: moduli, ssh_config and sshd_config.  All other files can be created by using ssh-keygen or copying files:  precodesudo cp /etc/ssh/ssh_config /etc/ssh/ssh_config~orig #just a backup sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config~orig #just a backup /code/pre  Key creation:  precodesudo ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key sudo ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key sudo ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key sudo ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key /code/pre  This may invalidate some services relying on the old keys!  <comment342109> Time Machine... <comment342113> You may be able to recreate the keys with ssh-keygen. See https://discussions.apple.com/thread/461831 <comment342144> /etc is linked to /private/etc, so there is only one folder /private/etc/ssh. @lhf You should leave that as an answer? <comment342173> Yeah in Mavericks the ssh folder doesn't exist at all and all ssh related files (keys/conf/moduli) reside directly in /etc <comment342174> @klanomath Thanks for that information! Perhaps that's what I was thinking of then, oops!
