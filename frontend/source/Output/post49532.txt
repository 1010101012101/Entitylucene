Change the default application (for a file extension) via script/command line? <body> Is there a way to define the default application for a file extension via an Apple script, command line command (like codedefaults write [...]/code).  I know that you can change it manually via the information panel or by using RCDefaultApp but as I have to setup many machines and user accounts I would like to find a way to automate the process.  <answer49536> Launch Services is responsible for default file associations.  Let's say I wanted to change all text files to open in Sublime Text 2.  First I need the kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier for Sublime Text 2. I can use mdls to get this information:  precode&gt; mdls /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app  _kTimeMachineIsCreationMarker  = 1 _kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    = 4001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 _kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    = 2012-02-22 03:49:19 +0000 kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier      = "com.sublimetext.2" ....snip.... /code/pre  I can find out the content type value for text files by inspecting one of them with mdls:  precode&gt; mdls test.txt  kMDItemContentCreationDate     = 2012-03-25 04:18:50 +0000 kMDItemContentModificationDate = 2012-03-25 04:18:50 +0000 kMDItemContentType             = "public.plain-text" kMDItemContentTypeTree         = (     "public.plain-text",     "public.text",     "public.data",     "public.item",     "public.content" ) kMDItemDateAdded               = 2012-03-25 04:18:50 +0000 kMDItemDisplayName             = "test.txt" kMDItemFSContentChangeDate     = 2012-03-25 04:18:50 +0000 kMDItemFSCreationDate          = 2012-03-25 04:18:50 +0000 kMDItemFSCreatorCode           = "" kMDItemFSFinderFlags           = 0 kMDItemFSHasCustomIcon         = 0 kMDItemFSInvisible             = 0 kMDItemFSIsExtensionHidden     = 0 kMDItemFSIsStationery          = 0 kMDItemFSLabel                 = 0 kMDItemFSName                  = "test.txt" kMDItemFSNodeCount             = 975 kMDItemFSOwnerGroupID          = 20 kMDItemFSOwnerUserID           = 501 kMDItemFSSize                  = 975 kMDItemFSTypeCode              = "" kMDItemKind                    = "Plain Text" kMDItemLogicalSize             = 975 kMDItemPhysicalSize            = 4096 /code/pre  In this case I'll change the default application for all codepublic.plain-text/code types.  To do this I type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSHandlers -array-add '{ LSHandlerContentType = \"public.plain-text\"; LSHandlerRoleAll = \"com.sublimetext.2\"; }' /code/pre  If I want the changes to take effect I'll need to restart Launch Services like so:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  And to give credit where credit is due, I learned about this approach from this stackoverflow.com question and answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9172226/how-to-set-default-application-for-specific-file-types-in-mac-os-x  <answer49540> This post on SuperUser also contains some helpful information. To learn more about LaunchServices, here's a link to Apple's developer documentation on it. Go to the section entitled emLSSetDefaultRoleHandlerForContentType/em (page 48).  <answer49541> duti is a shell utility that enables using a text file to configure the default applications for file types and URL schemes.  For example save a file like this as code~/.duti/code:  precodecom.gnu.Emacs public.plain-text all  com.gnu.Emacs public.unix-executable all org.videolan.vlc .mkv all /code/pre  Then run codeduti ~/.duti/code.  You can install duti with codebrew install duti/code or by running codewget https://github.com/fitterhappier/duti/archive/duti-1.5.2.tar.gz;tar -xf duti-1.5.2.tar.gz;cd duti-duti-1.5.2;./configure;make;sudo make install/code.  <comment69831> This seems promising, although I cannot seem to compile it on OS X 10.7.x or 10.8.x: `checking which SDK to use... configure: error: darwin12.0.0 is not a supported system`. <comment69832> The binary in the pkg installer still works for me on 10.8. <comment69835> I see. For future reference, here’s the link to that download: https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/duti/duti/duti-1.5.0/duti-1.5.0.pkg.tar.gz <comment70802> Does this work on 10.8? I set the default application to open `.avi` files to Quicktime Player (using Finder → _Get Info_ → _Open with… → _Change all_), then ran `duti -s org.videolan.vlc public.avi all` to use VLC instead, then [restarted LaunchServices](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/49536/4408) — but it seemed to have no effect. (See [list of system-declared UTIs](http://mths.be/utis).) <comment70852> It works for me at least. It shouldn't require rebuilding the Launch Services database or restarting or anything. If you take a look at `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist`, duti converts most filename extensions to UTIs automatically, so you can usually specify the types like `.avi` instead of `public.avi`. The UTIs of some filename extensions depend on the applications that are installed. <comment135755> @LauriRanta I just installed duti on OS X 10.9 through homebrew, but when I created the .duti file and ran `duti ~/.duti`, I got `role "all " unrecognized`. Just FYI, I had to comment out the first two lines of your sample code and it worked for VLC. <comment135854> @macmadness There has to be a linefeed at the end of the last line.
