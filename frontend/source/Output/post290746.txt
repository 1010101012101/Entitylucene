Can't detect SSD when connected externally <body> I have a white unibody macbook (5,2) I recently bought a usb 3 to sata connector and a Samsung 850 evo SSD. Both the SSD and my old HDD are running Mountain Lion, If that matters. I'm having the following problem:  The ssd works fine when used internally, but its not detectable when connected through the cable. The cable works just fine. I plugged in my old hard drive through the cable (while the Macbook was running off the SSD) and was able to access the contents without any problem. There was even a Time Machine popup asking me if I wanna use this as my backup disk. No such thing happened when I had connected the SSD.  So I turned to my windows 10 laptop for help. When the HDD is connected (through cable), It doesn't show up under "This PC" but disk management shows all its partitions. But when I connect the SSD (through cable), the disk management is not able to initialize the SSD. Shows the error "the disk is not ready". I used "diskpart" in comand prompt. "List disk" shows that the disk is online, but its size is 0gb. Upon using the command 'convert gpt' it shows the error "the device is not ready". List Disk correctly shows the size of the HDD.  How can I troubleshoot this? I wanna use the SSD as external SSD so its important that it works with the cable.  here are the images for what disk management and list disk shows: http://imgur.com/a/IkhpR  The SSD has no data, so if I have to format it or something, thats completely fine by me.  <comment367010> What kind of cable are you using to connect it with? - Have you plugged in power to the SSD? <comment367016> @jksoegaard [this one](http://www.amazon.in/Cables-Kart-USB-3-0-SATA/dp/B01FW7X3DG) <comment367017> @jksoegaard Does a hard drive require power like SSD? I was under the impression that the same sata cable can be used for connecting both ssd and hdd. The cable was working with the hdd which was the only reason  I concluded that the cable is fine. Is it possible that it isnt? <comment367087> The cable you've linked is both data and power, so that's alright. Have you connected both USB connectors to supply enough power to the drive? <comment367124> @jksoegaard Yes, I did connect both of them. I think the problem might be that the second connector doesnt actually work. The ssd seems to be fine on its own. Im currently using it as internal. The hdd works even without connecting both the connectors but the ssd isnt working at all when connected through the cable.
