Though there is g++/gcc in Xcode 8, gdb isn't found <body> When I installed command line tools of Xcode in old Mac OS X, there were g++/gcc of a compiler and a linker. There was also gdb of a debugger.  In Xcode 8.0 (8A218a) of Mac OSX EI Captain (10.11.6), there are g++ and gcc, but gdb isn't found. I'd like to use a debugger of a command line tool. Is there a debug command? If there is, please tell me.  When the g++/gcc [-c] em.c//em.cpp -g is executed before, *.o and executable format (a.out) seem to have included all symbol information. When g++/gcc [-c] em.c//em.cpp -g makes executable format (a.out) in case of Xcode 8.0 (8A218a) of Mac OS X EI Captain (10.11.6), a directory called a.out.dSYM is made at the same directory, and symbol information seems to be here.  When there are no debug command line tool, if it's possible to debug a program by a GUI of Xcode in IDE, please tell me the way.  Regards  <answer255233> The command-line debugger in Xcode is now LLDB; the relevant command is codelldb/code.
