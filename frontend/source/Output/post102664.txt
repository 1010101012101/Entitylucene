Can't resize (FileVault) partition after Bootcamp removal <body> I have a recent Mac with two partitions. The first one contains MacOS, and is encrypted with FileVault. The second one contained a Bootcamp Windows installation. Here is a screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQWt8.png" alt="DiskUtility screen shot"  I deleted the Bootcamp partition to reclaim space. Turns out: as a FileVault partition can't be resized, it can not grow to use the extra space.  What must I do to have strongone big partition/strong again?   <answer104114> As @alan-shutko pointed out with a hyperlink, the only way to resize a encrypted partition is to strongdisable encryption/strong, (rebooting again,) emthen/em changing the size. It worked for me!  It's a lengthy process if you wait for it, but bearable if you let the decryption happen overnight.  <answer222473> An alternative to the strongdisabling encryption/strong is to use command codediskutil cs resizeStack/code  The details on how it works has been documented by Klanomath here  One thing I wanted to add is that it also works with FileVault. I have tried and the performance was pretty good. It took me 5-8 minutes to resize the 230GB partition to 250GB.  To sum it up:  Firstly: Boot from a separate system such as USB or the internet  Secondly: use this command codediskutil cs list/code to get the volume Id of the strongLogical Volume/strong partition  I.e:  precode        $ diskutil cs list     CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)     |     +-- Logical Volume Group A061B44A-9E3D-41B1-8943-C11BD76DDE37         =========================================================         Name:         Macintosh HD         Status:       Online         Size:         250337738752 B (250.3 GB)         Free Space:   180224 B (180.2 KB)         |         +-&lt; Physical Volume 01F57DD6-2209-4FA6-A085-93C36C36B3D4         |   ----------------------------------------------------         |   Index:    0         |   Disk:     disk0s2         |   Status:   Online         |   Size:     250337738752 B (250.3 GB)         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 777A289D-71C0-43A2-9C10-39EFEE313964             ----------------------------------------------------------             Encryption Status:       Unlocked             Encryption Type:         AES-XTS             Conversion Status:       Complete             Conversion Direction:    -none-             Has Encrypted Extents:   Yes             Fully Secure:            Yes             Passphrase Required:     Yes             |             +-&gt; Logical Volume 11F03152-0861-4BA0-AA78-1F1D8CE520AF                 ---------------------------------------------------                 Disk:                  disk1                 Status:                Online                 Size (Total):          249999917056 B (250.0 GB)                 Conversion Progress:   -none-                 Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)                 LV Name:               Macintosh HD                 Volume Name:           Macintosh HD                 Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  It is strong11F03152-0861-4BA0-AA78-1F1D8CE520AF/strong  And you can use this command to resize:  precodediskutil cs resizeStack 11F03152-0861-4BA0-AA78-1F1D8CE520AF 250g /code/pre  <comment120852> http://superuser.com/questions/315803/how-do-i-resize-a-filevault-2-encrypted-partition <comment122589> Hi Alan, this link is very useful.
