Terminal colors in Mavericks <body> I am trying to get terminal colors working in 10.9. I have tried ls -G, I have tried exporting CLICOLOR=1, I have set a bunch of different TERM settings and none of it works.  Anyone know what the magic incantation is?  <answer148345> The default codels/code program on Mavericks is BSD codels/code, and codels -G/code is the magic incantation. The codels/code program included in GNU Core Utilities lists with color when using the code--color=auto/code flag, codels --color=auto/code. If you've possibly installed Core Utilities and neither of these work, try firing up a default Terminal.app profile (Basic, for example) and see if that works.
