Is there another way apart from screencapture to take a screenshot of a background window? <body> I'd like to take a screenshot of a background window given its title.  I know this can be made with codescreencapture -l idwindow output/code but unluckily I can't use this method because I'm on a 10.5.8 system so the command screencapture doesn't support the option code-l/code.  Are there other ways to achieve this? Thanks in advance.
