Can't use external USB headset if I reinsert during call on OS X <body> I have a USB headset hooked into my Macbook, that I use for calls with Skype, Google Hangouts, and UberConference (the last two via Chrome).  Fairly regularly, the USB-C jack slips out, and the call switches to the MacBook's speaker and microphone. When I reinsert, and then switch back to the headset's speaker and microphone (by selecting them after option-clicking on the volume icon), the call stays on the MacBook's speaker and microphone. I then need to hang up and redial to get the headset working again.  Any ideas on how to switch to a headset mid-call?  It seems ridiculous, but I may solve it by using a headset that hooks into the 3.5mm jack instead, like https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Analog-Stereo-Headset-Microphone-981-000587/dp/B00WGQNJK4
