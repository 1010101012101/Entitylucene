Prevent OS X from powering off, via CLI <body> I use codemaid/code to run a few maintenance scripts regularly, via codelaunchd/code. The time I chose for those tasks to run makes it very likely that I won’t suddenly decide to turn off my computer around then, but one can never be absolutely certain.  Sometimes, GUI apps prevent the computer from turning off due to unsaved changes. Can we replicate this via CLI? A bit like codecaffeinate/code but for power off instead of sleep.  <answer215110> the built in pmset utility can do this  precodesudo pmset autopoweroff 0 sudo pmset disksleep 0 /code/pre  Should work. If you want to see what all settings are available to codepmset/code, and their currently set values:  precodepmset -g /code/pre  You can also codeman pmset/code for more info on the pmset utility. Make sure to set the values back to their defaults after changing :)  <comment259948> Doesn’t work. I can still power off normally (even though the options did indeed change). <comment259978> What are you trying to do? Prevent a manual shutdown of the system? <comment260037> Yes. Like I said (emphasis added): “(…) suddenly **decide** to turn off my computer (…) GUI apps prevent the computer from turning off due to unsaved changes”. When do GUI apps typically do that other than when you’re trying to manually power off? If I only wanted to stop automatic power off, I’d use `caffeinate`, as mentioned. <comment260156> Good luck finding your answer.
