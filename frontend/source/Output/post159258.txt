healthy-wise: which keyboard is better? <body> there is a apple wireless keyboard and the apple keyboard with numeric keypad.  Which one is better for the overall healthy of my wrists and arms? I suffer from RSI and I want to buy a wireless keyboard but I'm afraid it will injure me.  <answer159342> I would highly recommend getting a natural ergonomic keyboard.

Microsoft and Logitech have a few that work with Mac's.   <comment187211> I have a wired one with the 10-key pad - but that's actually because I like a 10-key.
