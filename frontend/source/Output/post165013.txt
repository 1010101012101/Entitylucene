Console log flooded with discoveryd errors. How can I make them stop (not just hide them)? <body> They are 3,500 out of the 4,000 of the latest messages. They are always of the form:  precode1/5/15 1:07:38.307 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[73] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:40.487 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[68] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:40.489 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[70] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:40.911 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[73] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:42.668 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[73] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:43.099 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[76] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:45.281 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[68] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:45.963 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[70] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:48.062 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[73] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:49.151 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[68] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:50.250 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[68] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1] 1/5/15 1:07:51.345 PM discoveryd[49]: Basic Sockets Couldn't set IP_BOUND_IF on socket fd[70] scopeID[11] errno[22] result[-1]  /code/pre  And so on.

In the past the file descriptors in the error messages were different, but it was always three different ones.  <answer165020> Long term, the way to fix this is to opt in to sharing your logs and crashes with Apple and reporting this as a bug at http://bugreport.apple.com  Short term, you can choose a different network (probably a bad option) or suppress IPv6 (also probably bad long term) or try and disable the error logging entirely (probably bad).  4k lines of error messages isn't really a flood on any OS X hardware in the last dozen years. Even 400k messages a day isn't any significant load on the filesystem or the CPU. Is there something else you're trying to do where these messages are causing grief?  <answer182075> When i get these messages any DNS lookups made using discoveryd fail (Chrome and nslookup work). Workaround:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist /code/pre  <comment193596> Why do you suspect IPv6? When connecting via iPhone USB the option to change TCP/IP settings isn't present (no Advanced option) so I don't know if I can even turn off IPv6 for that method. And 4,000 entries is merely the limit in the "All Messages" query in Console. It is actually about 90% of ALL the entries generally, in the older log files as well. If you notice, they are about 1 second apart so ~60/minute. I can hide the sender "discoveryd" but that is not a solution, but hiding the problem. <comment193623> @geoO You're right - I didn't realize the console query pooped out at 4k so that's a very real downside. Have you seen this thread with people trying to neuter discoveryd to avoid host name changes? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153080/ <comment193729> 10.10.1 fixed the name changes, but not the discoveryd log entries. <comment216924> Thanks. That's clever, but I'd like to identify a cause. Still haven't. <comment216928> Sure me too, but at least that gets you running again. I made an alias in zsh
