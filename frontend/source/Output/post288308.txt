Two simultaneous Wi-Fi connections <body> Is it possible to use a USB Wi-Fi dongle to host a Wi-Fi network, while simultaneously using the built in one in the usual way?  The reason I want to do this is to wirelessly establish an IP network connection to an Intel Compute Stick which is hosting software license servers, without losing internet connectivity. I would need to do this in places where I won't have control of the main Wi-Fi network.  <comment364097> Although the the linked answer is about Yosemite specifically, it's still applicable to El Cap and Sierra.
