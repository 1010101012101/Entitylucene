Using dictation in the command line (e.g. transcribe an audio recording to a text file) <body> I have some audio recordings and would like to transcribe them into text files. I was wondering whether there is a command line tool that could use the built-in Dictation to do that? And if so, is there a known duration limit?  <answer89041> Dictation only works in standard text input UI widgets. Terminal applications typically don't use them.  The time limit per submission for processing is 30 seconds.
