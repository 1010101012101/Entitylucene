Native iOS email client displays tiny text on emails from just one Outlook 2011 user <body> One of my users has a macbook with Outlook 2011. When the user sends emails to someone using the native iOS mail app to read said emails, the text is very tiny.  Troubleshooting we've done:  ul liConfirmed that emails show up with normal sized text on Android and non-native iPhone email apps /li liVerified that the same emails are normal sized when viewed in outlook versions 2010 and up /li liWe tried changing the default font on Outlook 2011 - tried Calibri, Ariel, and Times New Roman sizes 12-16, the fonts clearly changed in the emails received but the size was still very small /li liThis is not happening to all Outlook 2011 users, just this one /li liTried turning it off and back on again.../li /ul  Has anyone else encountered this issue or have any other recommendations?  Thanks!  <comment366776> This may be related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/98926/outlook-2011-reports-incorrect-font-size
