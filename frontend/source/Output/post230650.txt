iMac Contacts app <body> Within Contacts I have an entry with my name, the previous company I worked with, job tile etc and details of the company website of the company I worked for before that.  I have tried to change this information and telling the system to ignore certain hone numbers included in e-mails.  The system is adamant that I have got it wrong and reverts back to the previous information.  I have tried deleting the contact (possibly a v-card) and re-entering but no luck.  How do I get the computer to stop being so helpful?   PS iPhone also has this problem - same contact but with different details.
