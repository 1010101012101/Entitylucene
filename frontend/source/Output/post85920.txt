Will changing an Apple ID remove the media content currently on the phone (iTunes?) <body> My son and husband share the same Apple ID and have all the same media on both iPhones (games, itunes) etc.  We are now experiencing a problem where my son receives all my husbands sent and received text messages through iMessage.  I was told to change the Apple ID on my son's phone to his own so he would no longer be receiving the messages.  When I change the ID, will he lose all of his iTunes?  That is his greatest concern.  Thanks.  <answer85927> The good news is that iOS allows you to have a separate iMessage Apple ID then your iTunes store Apple ID. To remedy your problem follow the steps below:  ol liOpen Settings.app (on your son's device) and go to "Messages"./li liScroll and tap on "Send &amp; Receive"/li liAt the top select "Use your Apple ID for iMessage"./li liTap "Create new Apple ID"./li liEnter in the information and follow the prompts./li /ol  After this is done, you can go to Settings.app - iTunes &amp; App Stores, and make sure the Apple ID there is set to your Apple ID.  And, to firmly answer your question: strongNo/strong, having a separate Apple ID for iMessage and iTunes (and the process of changing it) will strongnot/strong erase content.  emNote: instructions provided work best with iOS 6, but should be workable with iOS 5./em
