Revert to old finder item highlight style in Mavericks <body> In Mavericks, the finder item selection looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BdW0i.png" alt="enter image description here"  This looks emvery/em bad (hopefully just a temporary bug and not an actual design decision) and is inconsistent with the otherwise rectangular item layout and organization. Is there any way to revert to how it looked in Mountain Lion and previous versions (sample below):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CVvkX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
