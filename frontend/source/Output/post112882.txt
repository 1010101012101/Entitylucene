osascript to set secondary desktop background? <body> I have been using this:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC -//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;  &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;com.filmscoring.display.plist&lt;/string&gt;  &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;osascript&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;tell application "Finder" set f to POSIX file "/Library/Desktop Pictures/mac cinema desktop yoda.png" if desktop picture is not file f then set desktop picture to f end tell&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;  &lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;10&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  To prevent users from changing the desktop.

(In Applescript Editor, File  Open Dictionary  System Events.app, then click Desktop Suite on the left column) When I try to use it to get the picture property of one of them, I get "invalid key form" errors.
