YouTube doesn't work on a brand new MacBook <body> YouTube doesn't work in Safari on mid-2013 MacBook Air 13".  I've tried enabling HTML5 video at http://www.youtube.com/html5, and some videos did start playing after that, but most videos still don't work.  What I've noticed is that if you're viewing a video that does in fact work, and go into the full-screen mode, then all subsequent videos (which are suggested after the original video ends) do work, but only whilst you're still within the full-screen mode -- as soon as you exit the full-screen mode, depending on the video, Adobe Flash might again be required right away, without any option of going back fullscreen.  How do I make YouTube work without Adobe Flash?  Clearly YouTube videos should all work without any exceptions, since they all are already encoded in H.264 just fine.  <answer97146> So this isn't a total solution but it should help.  You reported that even though you joined the html5 program the following video did not play in html5:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I   I was able to reproduce that result in Chrome.  Here's how I was able to get the video to play in html5:  In Chrome:  View  Developer  Developer Tools  Click on the little gear icon  In the resulting preference window:  Settings  Overrides  User Agent [X]  iPad -- iOS5  Then reload the video and it will be in HTML5.  Similar solution exists in Safari, but I have to walk the dogs. Back soon.  <comment113216> Not all YouTube videos are enabled for HTML playback yet. <comment113222> @drummin, what do you mean?  why not?  is there any workaround, as obviously the full-screen html5 mode works for every single video, apparently. <comment113976> Can you give an example of a video that will not play for you in html5? <comment113978> @AllInOne, most of them don't work, actually; it's more difficult to find a video that would actually work; just one of the many examples of videos that don't work: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I , and if you search for "Daft Punk Get Lucky", then most of the videos in the results (remixes etc) won't play in HTML5. <comment113980> LOL, I guess one should run YouTube through a proxy with masquerading `User-Agent`!  How nice of Google to make its own browser able to view videos on YouTube if one claims it's not Chrome, but Safari on iOS! :-)
