Mac keyboard on powered hub does not work initially <body> I have a strange problem with my powered USB hub (USB 2.0) and my wired Apple keyboard which is plugged into that hub.  When I turn on the MacBook Pro (Early 2013), running OS X 10.9, the external keyboard is not working sometimes. As soon as I unplug the keyboard and plug it in again it works. This only happens when the MacBook has just turned on.  If I turn the powered hub to an unpowered hub (just by unplugging the power chord) the keyboard works fine - even at startup.  Does anyone have a clue what may be the problem?  <answer251085> You should try using the strongkeyboard extension cable/strong that comes with your keyboard. For somewhat obscure reasons, this solved the problem for me and other people trying to use the Apple Wired Keyboard with USB hubs.

I would recommend you not to use a powered hub if not necessary for the device itself -- this is because you're adding more power than it initially needs. <comment146824> The keyboard is not the only device connected to that hub (there is also a mouse and other devices - e.g. iPhone, iPads - from time to time). Some of them don't work when the hub is not powered. <comment312187> Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately this problem occurred when I was working for another company more than one year ago ;-) But I'll keep that in mind.
