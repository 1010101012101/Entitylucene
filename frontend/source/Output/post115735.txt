Transferring Mail data from one MBP to an other <body> I try to transfer my mails, preferences and all settings from one Mac to an other. Both are using the most recent Mavericks OS X.   I copied the ~/Library/Mail directory from the old one, as well as the ~/Library/preferences/com.apple.mail.* files. The 3 accounts seems to be working fine, and it appears, as if some of the mails have been transferred indeed, but I certainly miss the whole "ON MY MAC" folder structure form the new setup.  What is missing, where is that information stored?  <answer115744> In Mail.app in the "Mailboxes" section on the left side, (where Sent and Junk folders are) look toward the bottom of all the folders; there should be codeSmart Mailboxes/code and below that codeOn My Mac/code folders.  It seems that some people are finding that it's hidden after they've upgraded to OS X 10.9 Mavericks.   Next to "On My Mac" you should be a small "show/hide" as you hover over it with the mouse cursor. If you click on that hopefully you'll see those items once again.  <answer115841> I did multiple things in parallel and finally it works:  ul liremoved all Mails from the new MPB (~/Library/Mail/*)/li liremoved all preferences from the new MBP (~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail*)/li lirebuilt the mailboxes on the old MBP/li licopied everything once more/li liafter a restart, now it's working/li /ul  <answer122062> This worked for me:  copy the containers from the old to the new MBP  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.MailServiceAgent /code/pre  <answer148899> I read somewhere on the Apple forums about this tip.  I wanted to configure my mail account from scratch, in Mavericks, sync the remote e-mails by IMAP and then import the local e-mails. Since I forgot to use the export function in Mail, before installing Mavericks, I just copied the old local codembox/code over, but Mail wouldn't automatically pick it up, and using the import function on the same folder, simply didn't import anything.  So, to get my old local codeOn My Mac &gt; Archive/code folder I  ol liQuit Mail.app/li liCopied codeArchive.mbox/code from a backup to code~/Library/Mail/V2/Mailboxes/code/li liDeleted from code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/code the following items ul liEnvelope Index/li liEnvelope Index-shm/li liEnvelope Index-wal/li /ul/li liRelaunched Mail.app and proceed with the importing wizard/li liRenamed the newly imported folder to codeArchive/code (until renamed the e-mails show up as blank)/li /ol  Here, codeArchive/code is just my example codembox/code, substitute with yours.  <comment135432> It is not the case unfortunately. It is shown, and I can even see some default folders there (Junk folders, Recovered messages from different accounts etc), but not the others...
