Can Gatekeeper be disabled via terminal in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? <body> How can you disable Gatekeeper via Terminal Commands in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? I am looking to replicate the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane selection to allow applications downloaded from strongAnywhere/strong to run:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hDQjq.png" alt="enter image description here"  By having a terminal command, I can write a script to do this task remotely rather than manually going to each Mac and changing these settings with a mouse and several clicks.   <answer75396> precodesudo spctl --master-disable /code/pre  See the man page for spctl  <answer75398> The spctl tool should do the job.  codesudo spctl --master-disable/code will turn off the Gatekeeper checks, and codesudo spctl --master-enable/code will re-enable them (to the default setting of App Store and signed apps â€” it doesn't appear that setting it to App Store-only is possible).  Note that it will not throw any error if you run it without codesudo/code permissions, but codesudo/code is in fact required.  <answer75465> Either of these also disables the Gatekeeper dialogs (after restarting), but they don't change the setting shown in System Preferences.  precodesudo defaults write /var/db/SystemPolicy-prefs.plist enabled -string no defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices LSQuarantine -bool false /code/pre  I don't know if codespctl --master-disable/code is somehow different from disabling Gatekeeper from System Preferences, but codespctl --status/code changes to codeassessments disabled/code after disabling Gatekeeper in System Preferences.  <comment87583> The man page says that spctl --disable --label "Mac App Store" Will disable installation of all Mac App Store Apps, so it would seem possible that it could --enable only M.A.S. apps. <comment87584> @SamuelWalker I didn't notice that before, but what would really be required is a rule or label that's equivalent to all non-App Store apps. Otherwise it's moot, as you can't disable all other sources independently from what I can tell. <comment87587> That's true. I've just looked in the actual SystemPolicy Database, and from what I can tell there's only a few labels that it uses. "GKE","Developer ID", "Mac App Store", "Apple System", "Apple Installer", "No Matching Rule". Although as these Strings are arbitrary [And may change in future OSX versions] this may be too hacky, but it seems possible that you could manually disable GKE and Developer ID. <comment87630> @robmathers, thanks for your response! I learned another work-around: you can right click the installer and click open (which will open the app w/o checking w/ gatekeeper) <comment87665> Yeah, that's definitely the easier way if you just need to run some something on a one-off basis.
