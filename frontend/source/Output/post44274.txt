Is there a 'non-destructive' way to make mix cds in iTunes? <body> I am looking to collect a set of songs from my iTunes Library and build a custom playlist to eventually burn onto a CD. I want the songs to be in a specific order and have the same album title when burned onto the mix cd... but I want to preserve the original album titles and track #s from their albums of origin in my iTunes Library.   Is there a preferred approach to the above scenario?   <answer44275> The easiest way I can think of is to  ul lirestart iTunes with the Option key pressed to create a new library/li limake sure that the new library stores the tracks in a different place than the original one/li liimport the relevant tracks from Finder into the new library/li lirename, resort and burn/li liclose iTunes and delete the temporary library/li /ul  <answer44278> ol liCreate the new playlist./li liSelect all songs in the playlist and strongcreate duplicates/strong (here: AAC version) of them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dXnAA.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liRename the strongAlbum/strong title for all tracks and set the song order via the strongGet Info/strong menu entry.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cudOK.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liBurn the playlist and remove it./li liYou are save to strongremove the newly created Album in the iTunes Library/strong (here: Testalbum) because you created duplicates earlier./li /ol
