Avoid the terminal process to close, after BBEdit runs a script <body> I use BBEdit to write and test Python scripts, and I usually run the scripts in a terminal process, with the "Run in Terminal" command. Is there a way to have the terminal process opened by BBEdit stay "active", after the script is completed? I would like not to have the   precode[Process completed]  /code/pre  message and instead to still have an active prompt, either the shell or the the Python environment, with all the variables I have created in the script still existing.  This would be similar to the situation when I launch the script from an existing terminal process, either from the shell:  precode$ python script_name.py /code/pre  or from the python interpreter:  precode&gt;&gt;&gt; script_name.py /code/pre  In those cases, when the script exits, I still have the process active in the terminal window.
