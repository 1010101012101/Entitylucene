OS X 10.8, unsigned application: reset open confirmation <body> When I try to open an unsigned application by double clicking it in OS X 10.8's Finder, it rejects it. When I right-click the application and select Open, it shows a confirmation dialog. When confirming this with "Open", I can open the application the next time.  strongHow I can reset this behavior, so OS X 10.8 will again reject to double-click this application?/strong  I need this to test our application in a default environment without having to reinstall a backup.  <answer60023> You can add it using codexattr/code from a command prompt, for example to indicate it was downloaded by Safari and have it quarantined as such, just do;  precodexattr -w com.apple.quarantine "0000;4b3a40d0;Safari;|com.apple.Safari" &lt;path to file&gt;; /code/pre  <comment69081> Questions on Stack Overflow are expected to relate to programming or software development.
