Can I get a Windows XP-like application taskbar in OS X? <body> Apologies for cross-posting in SE, but maybe I'll get a better response on an Apple/OS X specific forum!  I'm looking for a strongWindows XP/strong-like taskbar application switcher in OS X. I'm strongnot/strong looking for anything icon-based like HyperDock and others, or anything that involves gestures like Expose. I want a simple bar at the bottom of the screen that I can click on buttons (strongnot/strong icons) to switch applications.  Also - answers like "just run Windows" are not appreciated ;)  <answer84952> There was Fantastik, but it's no longer in development.  <answer143074> Try uBar (I am the developer). It's got the functionality you want, and does even more than the Windows taskbar ever did. For example, hold the Ctrl key to make it display CPU % and RAM usage for tasks...!  <comment97830> What's wrong with the Dock? <comment97841> I'm just used to a taskbar-like environment, both on Windows and Linux. Even on Windows 7 I converted the standard icon-like Dock-clone to the classic button-based taskbar.  Plus, on a multi-monitor setup, the dock just doesn't work as well and I personally find using Alt+Tab/Expose a total pain. Give me a taskbar and a launcher like GNOME-Do, Spotlight, Alfred or even Windows' Start Menu search over a dock any day of the week! <comment97886> I have disabled the Dock and command+tab, and I've never used Exposé. I mostly rely on [keyboard shortcuts for applications](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20010/can-i-create-a-shortcut-to-open-a-specific-application-on-os-x/20116#20116), Alfred, hiding applications, and ⌘`. There doesn't necessarily need to be any visual way to change windows or applications in my opinion.
