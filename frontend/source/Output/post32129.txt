Subversion 1.7 for OS X Lion <body> I am quite lost, how do I get this to work. I can't find any GUI Programs that support 1.7 yet. Commandline would be okay, but I can't seem to find one!  Also how would the diff work on the commandline?  <answer32140> Macports has a subversion port. Others are listed on the subversion download page which includes Wandisco which seems to have a GUI.  <comment37510> Wandisco does not want to switch to 1.7. But I'll use your link. <comment132920> They are just slow to change now do 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 http://www.wandisco.com/subversion/download#osx
