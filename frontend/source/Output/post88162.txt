Canon imageclass MF4420w printer cant work with mac osx 10.8 <body> There seems to be no legit drivers available for the Canon MF4420w imageclass printers which dont seem to work.  <answer88165> That happens with Canon but also with HP printers as far i know  Your printer is not from this world! :)  What I mean by that it is not supported on USA sites.  But the good news is it is supported on Asian sites.  So go here and get your driver.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjMyy.png" alt="enter image description here"  http://support-asia.canon-asia.com/P/search?model=imageCLASS+MF4420w&amp;menu=download&amp;filter=0&amp;tagname=g_os  <comment103178> And you did your homework and could not find it at Canon!
