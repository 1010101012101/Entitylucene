Can I use Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter for Target Display Mode on an iMac? <body> Apple's support page for the Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter lists support for Thunderbolt Displays and no support for Apple DisplayPort displays. However it doesn't say anything about iMacs with Thunderbolt in Target Mode mode. Does Apple's Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter support Target Display Mode on an iMac?  My guess is that it does since Apple's support page for Target Display Mode says that you have to use a Thunderbolt source for an iMac with Thunderbolt in order to use Target Display Mode.  <answer263794> Unfortunately no.  I am running a setup with a 2016 MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter and a 2013 iMac 27".  strongEdit: I was wrong. It is possible. You will have to press Cmd+F2 to active TDM with this configuration. My old iMac switches to TDM automatically. That's why I was confused, sorry!/strong  <answer292704> Yes, in some circumstances. This Apple support page lists the supported hardware combinations and required cable(s).  <answer293950> Yes, I'm successfully running a setup with a 2017 13" MacBook Pro and a 2011 iMac. The original Apple USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter works fine for Target Display Mode.  <comment329680> I am also wondering this. Any updates? <comment369279> Hi Nathan, and welcome to Ask Different!
