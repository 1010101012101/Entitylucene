How can I fix a low speaker volume problem on my iPhone 6s? <body> I have a 6s with iOS 9.3x installed. Out of the blue, the speaker volume became barely audible. By speaker I mean the the loud speaker at the bottom of the phone.  I've used headphones and bluetooth to see whether those are affected as well - those continue to work fine.  I've done the following - none fixed the problem:  ul liRestarted the unit multiple times./li liI've cleaned out the speaker and headphone jack./li liI've blown compressed air at the problem spots./li liI've toggled Settings/General/Accessibility/Phone Noise Cancellation and Hearing Aids options./li liVarious miscellaneous things that I've read about here and there./li /ul  I know that if I take it to Apple store, they will suggest restoring a new phone, which I don't want to do. Other than reinstalling the OS, what else can I do to try and fix this issue?  <answer291279> Answering my own question.    Got it fixed. In case someone else has this issue, I took it to the Apple store. Turns out the speaker got clogged with microscopic particles (lint, sand, etc...) since I spend a lot of time outdoors. They have a very fine brush that can get those things out. The whole process took like 5 minutes.   <comment367419> Have you tried Settings/Music/EQ or Sound Check. Both should be off. <comment367445> @bret7600 Both are off.
