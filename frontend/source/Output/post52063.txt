Word 2011: Keyboard shortcuts for accepting/rejecting a tracked change AND moving to the next change <body> Is there such a built-in shortcut for doing such action pairs? (e.g. accept+move to next, using a single shortcut)  If not, how can I define such a custom shortcut?  <answer52126> There are good help pages direct in the application or online.

Note that the "Assign" button is now activated. Use it. Then click "OK".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xY9T9.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  That should be all you need to do.  <answer241781> ol liSave the document as Word 98/2000 .doc format/li liOpen in Word 98/li liTools/track changes/accept or reject changes/li liFind next/li liEither click accept or reject, which will do so and automatically find next, or "find next" which will leave the tracked change and find next/li /ol  <answer257202> In office 2007 you can set a custom shortkey at "File - Options - Customize Ribbon"  There set a nice key, like ctrl-shift-Arrow :)  <comment62685> I'm asking specifically about accepting tracked changes - those don't seem to be trivial to set up <comment321084> The OP says it's Office 2011.
