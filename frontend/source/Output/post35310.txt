How can I replace the nmblookup command on Lion? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Where is nmblookup in Lion?       In Snow Leopard, I used to use the command codenmblookup -U 172.16.0.10 -R domainPC | grep '&lt;00&gt;' | awk '{print $1}'/code Blindly upgrading to Lion, I didn't realize that Apple removed SMB I am now in trouble.  Is there anyway to replace it with an alternative? I see there is codesmbutil lookup [hostname]/code, but I am not sure if I can add a gateway like I did with codenmblookup/code.  <answer35801> Did you have a look at the man page?    Shouldn't codesmbutil lookup [-w host] name/code do the job?   precode Global options are as follows:  -h      Print a short help message.  -v      Verbose output.  The commands and local options are:  help command          Print usage information about command.  lookup [-w host] [-t node_type] [-e] name          Resolve the given name to an IP address.  The NetBIOS name server can be directly specified via          the -w option. The NetBIOS name type can be specified via the -t, the default is to lookup file          servers. For a complete list of name type please see "http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409".          The NetBIOS names will be unpercent escaped out if the -e option is specified.  status [-ae] hostname          Resolve given hostname (IP address or DNS name) to NetBIOS workgroup and system name. All Net-          BIOS names will be displayed if the -a option is specified. All NetBIOS names will be percent          escaped out if the -e option is specified. /code/pre   For me this worked (replacing your example):    codesmbutil lookup -w 172.16.0.10 -e domainPC | awk '/IP address of/ {print $5}'/code  <comment40725> This question has been asked (and answered) here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/24972/10193 <comment40945> The -R says it is illegal when I run it although smbutil lookup [-w host] name does work <comment40961> Sorry, copy/paste error: should be -e instead of -R, modified the answer <comment40974> Actually it goes beyond the other question, as it asks how to specify the host to query... But then again the man page answers that - anyway, I want the bounty ;) which was like 100 points
