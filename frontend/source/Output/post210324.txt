How to fix a MacBook's sound output which is stuck on headphones? <body> My MacBook late 2008, running Yosemite and it suddenly stopped playing audio through the internal speakers. I've checked "Sound" under System preferences, and headphones show up as the selected device for sound output. I tried connecting and disconnecting some headphones, and the mac did change the output to internal speakers, but only for a second. I then tried restarting the mac to see if it was something with software but it stayed the same. I also tried lightly cleaning the headphone port with a q-tip but that did not work. Does anyone have any suggestions?  <answer210418> Try getting some compressed air at Wal-Mart or Best Buy or another retailer and blow the headphone jack clean with that. A can will cost about $5 and you'll need to be 18 or older to buy it.  If it still doesn't work after that, the headphone jack will likely need to be replaced. Unless you do electronics repair, find a professional to replace it for you.  <comment253974> Have you tried a different user account? If it's a software setting issue, it's likely that the other users account will work OK. If the other user account is the same then it proves its a hardware issue.
