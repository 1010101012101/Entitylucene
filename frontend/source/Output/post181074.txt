How can I turn off 'Find My iPhone' after selling the phone? <body> I just sold my old iPhone 4s, but it was still logged in to 'emFind My iPhone/em'. How can I log it out without having the phone? I have changed the password and told the person who bought it to see if they can log it out, but it isn't working.   <answer181077> You can remotely remove the phone from your account using the iCloud website. Apple has a page with instructions on how to remove your device from Find My iPhone.  <answer181080> Log into the Find My iPhone part of the iCloud website.  Select your device from the drop-down list at the top of the screen.  Click on "Remove from Account".  This should remove your account from the device and enable the new owner to use it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Y6mG.png" alt="Image of Remove from Account option"
