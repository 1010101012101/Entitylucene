Acess to File Sharing files from other App <body> I would like to code a "Synchronization App" for iOs which goal is to copy files present in the iTunes "Files sharing" section, for a specific App :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zU4s.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is : knowing the eventual logins for the first app which provides "File Sharing", is it possible to code a new iOs App to simple copy files from the first App's "Shared files" ? Or it it impossible because of the sandbox principle ?
