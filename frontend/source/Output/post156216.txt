How to have full directory path always shown in mac terminal? <body> I found answers but they don't work: I added this line in code.bash_profile/code:  precodeexport PS1='\u@\H:\w$' /code/pre  It outputs:  precode\u@\H:\w$ /code/pre  Instead of:  precodeuser@host:my/Current/Path/In/This/Terminal/Window$ /code/pre  <answer156222> As I just removed codeoh my zsh/code I had to change terminal settings a little:   codeTerminal -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Startup tab/code, and change "Shell Opens With:" from "Default login shell" to Command and value code/bin/bash/code.   Now string codeexport PS1='\u@\H:\w$'/code works correct.   <comment183714> what is the full path to .bash_profile file? <comment183715> /Users/User/.bash_profile <comment183716> For the OP.  Seeing if you didn't put the command somewhere else and not his ~/ folder. <comment183717> can you post your .bash_profile?  I reproduced this only if I leave out the single ticks in the command.
