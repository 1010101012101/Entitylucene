El Capitan - no photos? <body> Just tried to access my photos after upgrading to El Capitan - no luck there. Looks like Photos won't load any photos - it starts with an empty window, when trying by clicking library I have the same effect...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ajya0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment253793> Welcome to Ask Different.  If you turn of wifi and reboot, what happens to photos? Any messages in console app once you open that app after the reboot? <comment253795> 10/10/2015 22:17:29.516 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.pid.Photos.12062) Path not allowed in target domain: type = pid, path = /Library/Frameworks/iTunesLibrary.framework/Versions/A/XPCServices/com.apple.iTunesLibraryService.xpc error = 147: The specified service did not ship in the requestor's bundle, origin = /Applications/Photos.app <comment253796> that info is repeated 3 times when starting Photos <comment253801> I hope that is the end. After another restart suddenly my Photos started to work properly.
