Streaks in PDF when using preview <body> When opening a PDF in preview there often are streaks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QesWl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anybody have an idea where this is coming from?  <answer183362> There's a bug somewhere (maybe a PostScript bug related to Preview) in the Mac workflow when you strongSave as PDF/strong. There is a rare occurrence where a line like that will occur, and the workaround is to repeat the strongSave as PDF/strong command. The bug is rare, so you probably won't get a repeat the second time.  I've encountered the bug a handful of times because I frequently use strongPreview/strong to compile screenshots (from online seminars) into a single PDF for later review. Here is the workflow I'm using when I encounter the bug:  ol liSelect all your screenshots, right-click, open with strongPreview/strong./li liReview the screenshots; right-click and delete any you don't want./li liOn the left, use strong[Cmd+a]/strong to select all the screenshots./li liUse strong[Cmd+p]/strong to open the strongPrint/strong dialog, but at the bottom-left, choose strongSave as PDF/strong./li /ol  After step (4), I find it necessary to quickly skim through the resulting PDF, just to confirm that a random line hasn't occurred. If it has, then I repeat step (4) and check again.  If my descriptions above are not helpful to you, then another thing to check is the software that was used to generate the PDF. For example, if you open a PDF in Acrobat (I'm not certain about Adobe Reader), then use strong[Cmd+d]/strong to open the strongDocument Properties/strong dialog, and the strongDescription/strong tab will list the software used to produce that PDF. Knowing this, you can potentially identify the source of issues.
