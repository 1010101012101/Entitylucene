Dock Icon Show Desktop <body> Is it possible to create a dock icon that shows the desktop?  Ideally I'm looking for 10.5.6 support and up.  <answer171136> You could create an AppleScript to minimise all windows and then pin it in your dock. An example of a script that minimises all windows can be found here:  ol liCreate a new Automator application that executes an AppleScript/li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/EbGclkd.png" alt=""  ol start="2" liExport this to save it as an app somewhere (File  Export)/li liAdd the exported application to your dock/li liThe first time the application runs, it will request the ability to control your computer, you need to allow it so that it can minimise apps./li /ol  You can optionally set a nice icon for this application, by selecting it and pressing codecmd/code+codei/code to open the info window and then pasting your custom icon over the current icon:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/kftVNSE.png" alt=""  <answer171719> There are 2 options.  You can either call codekey code 60/code(or the equivalent key show desktop is set).  Alternatively you can call Mission Control as described here.  precode/Applications/Mission\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\ Control 1 /code/pre  <comment201334> You could do the same and hide the application instead of minimising. <comment201441> +1 although I would ideally like to invoke "SHow Desktop" similar to if you pressed F11 on the keyboard or some equivalent.
