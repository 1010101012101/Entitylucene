Minimal Apple TV Setup <body> For an exhibition I need a minimal Apple TV setup that enables me to connect an iPad to an Apple TV via Air Play.   â†’ Ideally I strongdon't want to bring an extra router or computer/strong. Is it possible to connect the iPad to the Apple TV directly without having both joined to a wifi network?   If this is not the case, what would be an easy to setup solution for this? (Is it e.g. a separate Airport Express to create the network?)  <answer63541> I just called Apple to make sure. The answer is unfortunately as expected:   ul liNo, Apple TV and iPad cannot connect emdirectly/em without being part of the same network. /li liAnd yes, the best way to create this kind of network would be an Airport Express./li /ul  Well.
