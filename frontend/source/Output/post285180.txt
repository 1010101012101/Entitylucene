Backing up with rsync, how not to get into trouble with permissions and privileges? <body> I am backing up files to an external hard drive using rsync as a test, usually I just copy pasted but I read that rsync is more reliable and does a checksum to verify the copy so I am trying it out now.  I'm just using it as: codersync -a --progress [SOURCE] [DESTINATION]/code  I noticed in the manual page relating to rsync that it also copies the permissions and privileges, in fact after the copy when I right click and "emget info/em" on the files and folders, they have the same "emSharing and Permissions/em".  When I check files backed up during previous backup processes (using copy/paste), sometimes the permissions are em"read &amp; write"/em for the current user (me) and em"no access"/em for everyone else, some have em"read only"/em for everyone and spotlight.  strongMy question is:/strong how can I be sure that the backed up files and folders will at least be strongreadable by future users on my external hard drive/strong. In other words, strongwhen I'll access the hard drive using a fresh clean install of my OS using a new/fresh/possibly-new-with-a-different-user-name-account/strong, how can I be sure that I won't be locked out of my files by permissions etc ? I would like to at least get read only.  Do I have to manually right click every file and folder then em"get info"/em  and go to "emSharing and Permissions/em" and then choosing em"Read &amp; Write"/em for everyone ?  Thanks !  <answer285181> ol liYou can always access the files by being an admin on the computer you attached the external drive to and changing them. The admin super-user can always fix permissions issues./li liYou can change permissions at the top level by clicking "Apply to Enclosed Items" That will change everything in the folder and below./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2M6Ci.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer285185> External hard drives typically mount with the option codenoowners/code. The entire volume is set to ignore permission. The codeGet Info/code window will show that you are the owner and the group will show as your primary group (usually codestaff/code).  <comment359599> Thanks for that information, good to know ! <comment359601> Thanks for your input, indeed I tried to access files using another user account the Mac, and I could still access and edit them while they were on the drive, the main user had switched to the current user in *"Sharing and Permissions"* in *"Get Info"*.
