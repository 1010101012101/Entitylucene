How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book on Snow Leopard? <body> How do I locate the contact data for the Address Book in the hard drive on Snow Leopard?  <answer23031> Should be code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook//code  If you hit codeFile/code - codeExport.../code - codeAddress Book Archive/code you can create a backup. The resulting codeAddressbook - &lt;date&gt;.abbu/code file (which is actually a folder) actually just contains the contents of the abovementioned location.  <answer23032> The data is stored in several places. It's best to just export the data to the desktop if you want it in one file.   The complicated answer is in code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/code as well as in various cache files if you have enabled LDAP/open directory integration or other sync options to get contacts into and out of your address book.
