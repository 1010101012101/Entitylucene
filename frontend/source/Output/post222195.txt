Connect to USB-Tethered Device over WiFi <body> Is it possible for peers connected to an iPhone personal hotspot to connect to each other, or is the device firewalling them somehow?  I'm tethering a Raspberry Pi over USB to my iPhone 6s running iOS 9.2 and attempting to connect to the Pi over my MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11, which is also tethered to the iPhone via the Personal Hotspot (I'm not entirely sure if it's using WiFi or Bluetooth).  Packets I send from the MacBook (172.20.10.3) to the Pi (172.20.10.5) are being dropped.  Due to a lack of devices to test with, I'm not currently able to test connections from the Pi to the MacBook.  Is there some firewalling happening?  Is anybody aware of a means to disable it?
