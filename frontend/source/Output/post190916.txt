OS X Yosemite focuses automatically <body> Lately I started experiencing that - 'issue' / 'bug' / 'feature' on my MacBook Air with OS X Yosemite.  Whenever I open a new window (of any app) something gets focused immediately (getting that selection frame around it, usually blue). That happens in notification center as well. That's really annoying.  Anyone knows how to get rid of it?  Here's an example, look at the segment control:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JWZo4.png" alt="OS X Yosemite Focus"  <answer190950> This is because strongFull Keyboard Access/strong is turned on. To turn it off, go to  emSystem Preferences/em, emKeyboard/em, emShortcuts/em tab, and select emText boxes and lists only/em at the bottom.  Alternatively, Control-F7 will toggle this.
