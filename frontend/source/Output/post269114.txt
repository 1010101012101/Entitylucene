macOS Sierra - Stop application asking for password (AMPPS) <body> AMPPS prompts me for my admin password on startup, on shutdown, and whenever I start/stop Apache or MySQL. Is there any way to make it stop asking for a password? I tried the answer given in this previous question (editing /etc/sudoers) but it doesn't seem to work in Sierra.  <comment338055> Yes, the path is /Applications/AMPPS/Ampps.app <comment338058> That's not the executable. It should be like `/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox`. Anyway, what exactly do you run? Do you execute `sudo `? If not that has no way of succeeding. Do you click the icon? The referenced answer is a fallacy. <comment338060> Right now AMPPS is set up to run at login. I was trying to edit the sudoers file so that it wouldn't ask for a password (I don't know much about Terminal stuff but was carefully following the instructions). So you're saying that won't work? Is there another way to do it? <comment338063> It might be hard to find a person who has the knowledge and at the same time is willing to spend their time on checking this particular software (i.e. people with some experience won't use this bundle). I think you might be better off by asking at the Softacukius forums. <comment338064> That's probably a good idea. Thanks for your help!
