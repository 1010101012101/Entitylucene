My mac mini freezes - only mouse cursor is alive. What is a problem? <body> I do not like to shutdown my Mac mini - so it works 24/7. But sometimes it freezes - I can move my mouse cursor, but anything else is frozen - screen does not react to clicks/keyboard presses - it's like it's not a GUI anymore, but screenshot of it.  It seems that this problem happens when MEMORY PRESSURE indicator from Activity Monitor is "high" http://prntscr.com/eqcaan  Here's the output of strong/var/log/system.log/strong before freeze:  precodeMar 30 16:05:21 yaru kernel[0]: Google Chrome He (map: 0xffffff801fb3d4b0) triggered DYLD shared region unnest for map: 0xffffff801fb3d4b0, region 0x7fff92400000-&gt;0x7fff92600000.
