Is there a way to request iMessage history from Apple? <body> Recently there was a famous case: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute  I was wondering if a regular citizen em(US or non-US based)/em can apply to Apple and strongrequest all the iMessage history/strong since the creation of my AppleID?  em(random thought: I should read T&amp;C and privacy policy to learn who actually owns the right to my own messages)/em  Alternatively - is there a service that would retrieve all the history without any involvement from Apple?  hr  Caveats:  ul liI've been changing devices so not sure if that would work: How can I locate an iMessage from 1-2 months ago? Possible?/li liI'd would the material to be admissible in the court/li /ul  <answer245455> As far as I know Apple doesn't store your iMessage history. Case in point I am missing loads of iMessages on my Mac after a clean install that are present on my iPhone. You would need to back it up yourself.  <comment302330> Check out the accepted answer from [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/216356/88313).  If it helps you then I'll add it as an answer. <comment302340> That's the question I referenced in my question and apparently the messages span only back to February - http://i.imgur.com/PqeZZEq.png - time when I reinstalled me OS... <comment302491> Sorry, I missed that link somehow. <comment302592> Of course you can request it -- how could you be prevented from doing so? Just write a letter to Apple. They won't _comply_ with your request, of course. <comment302619> @MikeScott Write a letter. Of course. Which department. Which legal paragraph to quote. If I lawyer-up they may actually may want to comply... Any suggestions here? <comment304012> @MichalStefanow I just saw [this page](http://www.iphonerecovery.com/recover-deleted-imessages-from-iphone-ipad.html) while looking for something else and I remembered you had a question about it.  I don't know if it will work for you or not.  If it does, post back here and I'll add it as an answer. <comment304024> @fbara Thank you.
