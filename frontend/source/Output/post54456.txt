Why can't I hide my active application (e.g., Chrome)? <body> This happens from time to time: the "hide" option is just grayed out and the usual shortcut doesn't work. I'm not doing anything special or stuck in a modal window—it just isn't available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qTUB.png" alt="hiding Chrome"  <answer54459> This is OS X default behavior in every app if you have hidden all other apps before with "Hide Others" or kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdH/kbd. In such a case it's not possible to hide the front most app, that's why both options are greyed out/inactive.  <answer64137> Here's a workaround:  If you hold the kbd&#x2325;/kbd-key and click the desktop, your app will hide.   <answer108198> The same thing happened to me. I figured out that Google Chrome was in full screen mode on another (secondary) display. Consequently, OS X could not hide it.  <answer232653> Go to the Chrome to and select "Show All", the option will reappear.  <comment301037> Wow, that is nuts. User-unfriendly. "You told me to do X before, and now I see you're telling me to do Y. Faced with contradicting [ed. not really] instructions, I'll just ignore this last thing you told me to do." <comment301038> Sure, "We're looking for long answers...", but this is the only answer describing how to fix the situation. <comment362274> "it's not possible to hide the front most app". This is a weird assumption Mac OS makes. I believe some people want to access the desktop (without some gesture), or have a "clean" state of windows. The shortcut I found is to switch to the Finder and hit ⌥+⌘+H.
