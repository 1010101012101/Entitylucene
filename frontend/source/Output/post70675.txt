Wiki Server on Lion "Client" <body> Is it possible to activate the wiki server on osx lion (not server) ?  I've managed to do that with the VPN server using this guide: http://www.macstories.net/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-server-on-your-mac-and-access-everything-remotely-with-an-iphone/  With wiki server, is it possible? (I'm using the latest osx lion version)  <comment82057> There is no out-of-the-box wiki server in in the non-server version of OS X Lion. Are you looking for an alternative wiki server or are you more interested in a web server per se? <comment82069> I thought that the wiki server, just as WebDAV and VPN services were already built in, just needing to be activated.
