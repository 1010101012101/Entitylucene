How to move existing reminders to iCloud in the reminder app? <body> There is already a question on reordering of items in the reminder app, but I want to go one step further and move existing items from the device to iCloud. Is that possible at all?  <answer48711> Go to strongSettings  iCloud/strong (Alternatively, Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  iCloud) and make sure Reminders syncing is on.  <answer66604> You can't seem to drag lists down to iCloud, nor can you seem to drag an item(s) from one list to another - but you can move items using the context menu  Create duplicate lists in the iCloud section of the list of lists...(you can probably see one called 'reminders' there already)  Go back to the list you want to move highlight all items in the list (not the text in one item but the item itself) - then bring up the context menu and select move... chose your duplicated list as destination  You may also wan to move the completed items from the old list itself to the new click on the 'completed' at the top of the list  <answer92435> ol liTap the item/li liSelect "Show more..."/li liTap "List"/li liSelect the list where to move the item./li /ol  <answer210132> Select the item  A blue circled i will appear on the right  Select the i  The context  menu will appear   List of the second last item   select the list name and the other list names will appear  select the new list name from the list   <answer259317> The easiest way to do this is to use the Export and Import options from the File menu. Export from one list and import to another - worked for me on Sierra.  <comment78790> I can't quite follow you. How do you bring up the context menu...? <comment108422> That seems new. Nice feature.
