When my iPhone is hooked up to iTunes, I can't sort music by Album <body> iPhone 5s iTunes 11.2.2.3 Windows 7 OS  I synch on my Mac Pro at home...  When I get to work I have to use a Windows machine.  I authorized my iTunes app on my work machine.  When I view my iPhone music in iTunes, I can only sort by name and not by any other column.  How can I sort by Album when looking at music on my iPhone in iTunes?  EDIT  Picture added See good column in green and nasty stupid head columns in red.  No comments about my music choices allowed...lol img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j6BEN.png" alt="View of my iPhone songs in iTunes"  <answer135767> With your iPhone connected, go to the codeSummary/code page and check codeManually manage music and videos/code.  <comment160768> Do you mean that when you click on the "Album" header, nothing happens? <comment160945> Yes; at home, the column headers do their thing and I can sort on any column. At work, clicking the other columns do nothing. I updated my question with a pic <comment161564> Did my answer below solve your problem? If so, please mark it as the solution so the question can be closed. Thanks <comment161713> If I turn that on, and click apply, then iTunes says - Hey! I'll wipe your whole iPhone library just for fun! Is that OK? NO... So how do I get my iPhone music on my work PC so I can synch without erasing everything?!? I realize that's a different question, but I don't know if you're solution works because I don't want to wipe my phone... <comment161739> Sorry, I'm confused. In your question you stated that you sync your iPhone with the library on your Mac Pro at home. Do you also want to sync with the library on your work PC? <comment161762> No - I just want to play it at work. I can't sort anything when at work from the issue described above. It's seems ridiculous that you must synch the iPhone JUST to sort music by album, artist, or some other attribute. <comment161763> Click `Manually manage music and videos`. It may wipe your iPhone library the first time (don't know why it feels the need to do this, but oh well). Then just re-sync at home, and the next time you use your iPhone at work everything will be working like you want <comment161764> Really? Ok - I'll try that. It's still silly of Apple to do it this way. <comment161765> Now I get to drive home with no music. lol If this works tomorrow, I'll mark yours as the answer. <comment162501> Thanks Chris. It's fine, even after upgrading iOS <comment162516> Good to hear! The option should stay set until you manually uncheck it. <comment198377> still works in iOS8/iTunes 12 <comment223948> Annoying that it wants to wipe your phone just to enable "manage manually" so I can get some freaking sort columns!
