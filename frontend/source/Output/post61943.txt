Is there a way to add items to notification center through terminal or other means? <body> I'm wanting to add specific Websites to notification center (the stack exchange network, for example) and I want to be able to see various notifications that the website would send me.   Is there a way to add a website to be checked in notification center via terminal or some sort of script that can be written?  <answer61951> You can send a notification from the command line with this terminal-notifier utility. Getting the notification data off a site can be fairly involved, requires at least some decent scripting and/or web coding knowledge, and is probably a better question to pose on Stack Overflow.  The basic outline of such a script would be:  ul liOpen a site/li liSend login data if necessary/li liScrape the page for the data you need (unless you're lucky and the site has a JSON or XML API, in which case you can parse that)/li liSend the appropriate data via the terminal-notify utility/li /ul  This sort of thing may be more common in the future though, as Safari 6 and Mountsin Lion add support for web notifications, which will allow a site to display notifications, emwhen Safari has an open tab for that site/em.  Support for this needs to be coded into the site however, so it's not really an end user solution I'm afraid.  <answer61982> If you dontâ€™t want to script anything, try this little menu bar application called SENotifier. I use it for all notifications related to the StackExchange network.  Also, it might me a good idea to first check if the website in question has a RSS feed for the notifications you want.   In case you want to write a scraper, first have a look at possible options regarding languages and modules. I personally have used WWW::Mechanize with Perl, and loved Nokogiri with Ruby.  <comment71548> Ok this is helpful. Now I just need to figure out how to write a quick program to run in the background and check for new notifications every minute or so. Hmmm... <comment71598> This combined with [Hiss](http://collect3.com.au/hiss/) is doing what I originally set out to do. Thanks! <comment71610> You are welcome! Shameless plug: If you find this answer useful, please consider marking this answer as 'accepted'. Thanks! <comment71613> I think I might, but CanuckSkier's answer is more general and I might need to create a generalized app for other sites in the future.
