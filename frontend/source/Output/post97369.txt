YouTube upload from iPhone going to wrong YouTube account <body> I have linked YouTube accounts. One is my personal Google+ account: here and the other is my normal YouTube page that I use for business videos, etc. here.  Since I "merged" those accounts, it seems that every video I upload from my iPhone goes to the personal account, not the business account.  Anybody have any fixes for this, to force the iPhone to upload to a specific YouTube account?  <answer97370> YouTube lists the different ways to upload from mobile in this support page. For small uploads, I would suggest uploading by email. G mail limits you to 25 MB. Please verify that your channels have unique email addresses, distinct of each other.   Another option is to use the YouTube Capture app which is available on the iTunes store. I do not have an iOS device so I cannot test this method.   <answer97371> Fixed this. Required signing out of Google+ app on iPhone then RE-signing in using correct Google+ account. Somehow YouTube camera capture on iPhone is tied to Google+ app on iPhone.  <answer228439> try to sign out and log in again that should help. if that doesn't then try emailing youtube to help solve this issue  <comment114208> Are you using the YouTube app by Google from the app store? <comment114209> Thanks I'll try the YouTube Capture App... <comment237870> Glad you found a solution.
