How to fix iCloud Outlook calendar pasting? <body> I have a client that has Outlook 2007 on Windows 7. He's unable to right click and paste into the notes section of an appointment (the contextual menu doesn't even appear). I've seen other people having this issue on the Apple support forums and the Microsoft support forums, but no one has posted a resolution. Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer78891> Apparently Apple made al meetings emread-only/em to prevent iCloud from resending meeting invitations. Doing kbdControl/kbd+kbdV/kbd should paste, though.  There is, too, a emWibbly-Wobbly/em workaround for meetings:  ol liOn the meeting, click emForward/em and emForward/em (from the displayed menu). Outlook will then tell you that you can't forward the item and will offer to make a copy in your default calendar./li liChoose emYes/em and emA new message with the appointed attached notes./em/li liClose the forward message strongwithout/strong sending./li liClick on the emMove to iCloud/em. Doing this will create a strongduplicate/strong but editable appointment in the iCloud folder./li liDelete the strongoriginal/strong appointment./li /ol  <answer98251> Drag the appointment into the My Calendars folder, then edit it and add notes, etc.  Then drag it back to the icloud folder.  Additions will be there.
