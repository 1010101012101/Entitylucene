White iPhone 4 vs. black iPhone 4 <body> Other than the color, what exactly are the difference between the black and the white iPhone 4?  <answer14284> Its supposed to be identical, but 0.2mm thicker   <answer14286> Check out this gallery for some comparison photos.  <answer14289> There are two changes that I've read about, both related to the color change but not just that the color is different:  ol liThe strongrear camera/strong positioning has been slightly modified to reduce the amount of light that leaks into the area; it's said to be recessed slightly deeper into the device, though other reports indicate a slightly different casing. Makes sense, since the black glass and plastic would absorb light that the white glass and plastic would let through, likely causing washed-out pictures (or the software adjusting the white balance incorrectly, losing details in lighter and/or darker areas of the image)./li liReports also indicate that the strongproximity sensor/strong has been modified. Though it's quite possible, if the iPhone uses a capacitive proximity sensor such a change shouldn't be necessary (if it uses an infrared proximity sensor then the same light change issue would require a change). It seems more likely that the change was made for the strongambient light sensor/strong which is right next to the proximity sensor, since the ambient light sensor would have light change differences as well./li /ol  Other than the the phones are identical. The new one is no faster, for example.  <answer14308> There is only a Color Difference between both devices.  <comment15389> The thickness thing has pretty much been disproven. It turns out that, like most manufactured goods, all iPhones differ slightly in thickness. One report I read showed that much variation between 4 different black iPhones. <comment15391> @Matthew: I would think that even the temperature of the phone would make a difference, when we are talking about variations as small as that. <comment15392> @jason404 Agreed. 0.2mm is equivalent to the diameter of 1-2 human hairs. <comment15413> All reports of this being systematically true seem to be false and due to errors in measurement and one time manufacturing variations rather than a systematic change in specifications.
