How do I get out of the "continuous pages" mode? <body> How do I get out of the "continuous pages" mode?  It annoys me like hell! I want to see whole pages with a bit of space around them.  Is this another thing that iWork 13 can't do?  Just a one pixel line separating different pages in image below. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9Myq.png" alt="Just a one pixel line separating different pages"  <answer126419> strongThis is currently not possible./strong The gap between pages is not customisable and it is not possible to disable continuous scrolling.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/pages.html/li /ul  <answer126796> If you only want to view (not edit) you could do Print/PDF/Open PDF in Preview  <answer126799> One way to give it some kind of "page view" could be to enable the "Show Layout" option. It give you a view with header, footer and margins shown.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NtzO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer286896> This problem is so annoying.  It makes everything look like one long page... even to collaboration viewers on iCloud.com, etc.  Complain, complain, complain.... (to Apple, that is)  The only saving grace... emThumbnail View/em.  It stronghas/strong nice spacing betwixt each page.  (Probably why Apple refuses to let us have it, emelsewhere/em....)  kbdOption/kbd + kbdCommand/kbd + kbdp/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r1kwA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment148051> poking around in the app it doesn't look like there is a way to do this. <comment148262> Just as I thougth. A hack would suffice. <comment148528> This doesn't increase the space between pages, nor the space around the page (it decreases it unless you increase the size of the window)â€¦ <comment148530> Yeah you're right about the space between the pages, but it doesn't decrease the page, it just show the editable area. To change the space around the page, you need to change the "Document Margins" <comment148532> I meant the grey background space behind (therefore around) the page, not the margins of the actual page. <comment148534> This grey background is not affected in my version of Pages (v5.2), when I enable the Layout option, so I don't know what you refer to ?? <comment148992> A hack would suffice. I'm no stranger to binary patches. Bounty will only be awarded to the solution, not information that it is not possible which is what I suspected.
