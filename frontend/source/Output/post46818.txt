Appstore, turn off password for free apps download? <body> is there a way to turn off the password requirement when downloading free content from the appstore?   I just find it slightly annoying when other app marketplaces don't have that compulsory requirement  did not google, thanks for doing it for me while I type my password  <answer46820> No, there’s no way to do that on a clean iOS install.  However, if you don’t mind jailbreaking your iOS device, you can use PasswordPilot to auto-enter your App Store password.  <comment53559> I assume that would auto-enter the password for all purchases, and not just free purchases? <comment53561> no jailbreak on 2012 ipad <comment53562> @AdamDavis Yeah, me too. <comment53601> @cqm Then you’re out of luck, until a jailbreak exploit is found for the new iPad. (Your question didn’t specify this was about a 2012 iPad.) <comment288647> The App Store behaves differently on OS X and Windows and iOS so it's not clear what device you hope to manage or if you are asking if there is a cloud setting to disable it on your account
