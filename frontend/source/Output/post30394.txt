Network problem isolated to this macbook air, where to look next? <body> Periodically, once or twice a day, I'll start to experience network issues (latency and dropped packets) on this one machine while I'm browsing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6s7U.png" alt="ping results"  ul liOther machines on the same Linksys WRT54G wireless network continue to function normally/li liI've attempted shutting down all running programs that I can identify/li liI've attempted disabling and re-enabling the wireless connection and reconnecting to the network/li /ul  The only thing that seems to fix it is restarting the machine. So that's what I keep doing.  My best guess is I have either have something running on the machine that I haven't identified causing this issue ... or ...?  Very open to any ideas on where to look or what types of things might cause this :)  <answer49714> I advise you to download and run codeiStumbler/code http://istumbler.net/ on your Mac. Run it around the place where you want to work and at peek hours of the day (where your neighbours are also using their Wi-Fi PC and routers).  This run should give you a clear indication of which channels are received at a high power level. You should absolutely avoid these overloaded channels (most probably 1, 6 &amp; 11) and pick a channel which is either free or received at the lowest signal level emwhere/em and emwhen/em you work.  <comment34862> I started experiencing the the network issues again.  This time I was able to get it working again without restarting the air. I changed the channel on the linksys wrt54g from the default 6 to 11 instead. I was confident that the other machines on the network were working, but I must have been wrong. This might have been it. I will update again if problems persist. <comment34863> In any case, it's clear this probably isn't specific to the mac. I'll post what I find here in case anyone finds it useful, but the original question is likely wrong.
