How do I set up IPv6 on my Airport Extreme? <body> I am trying to set up IPv6 on my Airport Extreme. According to AT&amp;T / BellSouth, my network is IPv6 ready.  h2Network Setup/h2  I currently have two parts to my network setup.  ol liWestell Model 6200 modem (IPv6 ready)/li liAirPort Extreme (fifth generation)/li liAirPort Express (the last model that plugs directly into the wall)/li /ol  My modem is plugged directly into the wall via a DSL cable, and then my router is connected to the modem via an Ethernet cord.  h2Setting Up IPv6/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I17jG.png" alt="AirPort Utility Setup" I tried setting this up on my own in 2012, but the interface of AirPort Utility has changed drastically since then, and I also recall losing all Internet capabilities when I "set it up" last time, so I want to make sure I do it correctly this time.  Upon choose a manual configuration, I'm greeted with different options about whether I want to choose a Native or Tunnel Mode, whether I want to enable IPv6 Connection Sharing, and more.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hwdXd.png" alt="Example of Options"  I'm not sure which of these options is the "preferred" method, or what is required of me to properly configure AirPort Extreme to use IPv6.  I am willing to plug and play different configuration options to see what works best.  <answer130058> ol liIn the "Configure IPv6" menu, select "Automatic"./li liIn the "IPv6 Mode" menu, choose "Native"./li /ol  That should be all that's needed. The device should be able to autodetect the rest of its settings.  If that doesn't work, then you may need to check the settings with your ISP.

It'll tell you whether IPv6 is working, and it'll also check for some common IPv6 problems. It also has [some very useful instructions](http://test-ipv6.com/broken.html) for troubleshooting broken IPv6. <comment152868> Uh-oh, seems AT&T and BellSouth may not be supporting it like they said they were... `Your DNS server (possibly run by your ISP) appears to have no access to the IPv6 Internet, or is not configured to use it. This may in the future restrict your ability to reach IPv6-only sites.` I'll have to contact my ISP later to resolve this. <comment152904> If the other tests all passed, then it's probably OK. Many consumer devices don't yet support DNS servers advertised over IPv6, even if they otherwise support IPv6. This isn't necessarily an issue: DNS will simply run over IPv4 instead, and most DNS servers still return AAAA records over IPv4. So apart from the initial name resolution, which will work over IPv4, the rest of the IPv6 traffic will generally work fine. (Note: I'm not sure whether the Airport Extreme supports DNS advertisements over IPv6). If any other tests failed, then sort them out first. <comment260399> Do you know what the checkbox that says "enable ipv6 connection sharing" does? Find it after clicking the "internet options" button at the bottom of the "Internet" pane of the Airport utility.
