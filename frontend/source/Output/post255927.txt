number of photos in iphoto INCREASES as photos are deleted <body> When I try to delete photos from iphoto and thus my entire computer, the number of photos in iPhoto increases instead of decreases? I am trying to make space on my computer and need to get rid of these damn files!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XhOgh.png" alt="see the number of photos in the right corner"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Agx0v.png" alt="the number of photos in the right corner has increased instead of decreased?"
