Can't complete restoring iCloud backup <body>    strongiCloud Restore in Progress/strongbr   iCloud Photo Library will begin syncing when this device has finished restoring from backup.   What can I do about completing the restore?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PFl0q.png" width="375"  <comment353068> What happens if you force reboot your phone (hold down power and home buttons for ~10 seconds)? <comment353070> how long will that take? <comment353071> The entire process should take 60 seconds <comment353073> it shut off completely... <comment353074> what is supposed to happen? power it back on? <comment353075> Turn it back on and see if that message has gone away <comment353076> a progress bar popped up for a sec and then it just went black and I let go, was I supposed to continue holding both to force the reboot? <comment353078> It shouldn't matter. Is the problem still there? <comment353079> yea, only problem that I can tell.....when I try to turn on that icloud photo library...I get the "iCloud restore in progress" popup
