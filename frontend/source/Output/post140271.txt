Is there any Itunes API? <body> What I am actually looking for is to get the app download statistics from itunesconnect.  There was this idea where some coding could be done in the iphone app section so as to determine if the app is being launche for the first time and so fire a url with the flag.   But I would like to retrieve an app's download statistics from itunesconnect itself. Can there be a way?  <answer140275> As noted in a PDF released by Apple, there is a java tool to export the data from iTunes connect.   This is to compensate the absence of API for iTunesConnect.   <answer262155> after looking everywhere I did not find a PHP version of the reports API so made my own.  You can check it out on https://github.com/Finnb8r/itunes-connect-sales-api-php .  I realize that this is not an Objective-C wrapper but this link comes out on top when generally looking for an API.
