Address book not showing details with new Lion <body> I have just downloaded Lion and iCloud and now when I open Address Book from the dock on my desktop, all the names come up but no details????  <comment31692> May be just an effect of overloaded servers, I had the same issue with Contacts on my iPhone where it took about 6h to update all addresses. <comment35157> Are these addresses that were on your system before, or ones you just synced?
