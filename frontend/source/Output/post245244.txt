Should I buy the discontinued iPhone 5s? <body> As you know that iPhone 5s is discontinued by Apple after the launch of 5se. Thus 5s has gone real cheap here in India.Should I buy it? For how long will apple be providing support for the discontinued device? Should I be getting iOS updates on my 5s in future? Please Help!  <answer245251> It's your decision. The iPhone 5S is not a bad phone, though it won't be quite as responsive as the iPhone SE.   It will support iOS 10 when it comes out this year and almost certainly iOS 11 when it comes out late 2017, possibly iOS 12 even, but whether you would want to install those updates would be a judgment call since they will probably make the iPhone run progressively slower on that older hardware.  I had an iPhone 4S, which ran great on iOS 5. It ran okay on iOS 6. When I put iOS 7 on it it took a speed hit but was still usable. That is like the iPhone 5S on iOS 9. My iPhone 4S was compatible with iOS 8 and iOS 9 but they phone would have been too annoyingly slow, and I instead upgraded to the iPhone SE, and it is great.  <comment302325> I don't think anyone can answer this question for you.  Only you know if the price you'll pay is a good deal.  Only Apple knows if the 5s will be supported in future updates.  My **guess** is the 5s will be supported at least thru iOS10 and the iOS 10 updates. <comment302474> I am using an iPhone 5s on iOS 9.3.2 and am not suffering serious speed issues. It's definitely better than an iPhone 4s on iOS 7.
