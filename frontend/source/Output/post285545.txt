mac terminal displaying other name than host name <body> I have recently been in terminal and somehow I lost my Mac name.  It's showing a strange IP followed by some numbers.  My computer's name is "my-xxx-macbook-pro."  When I type codehostname/code I receive:  ip-10-xx-xx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.internal  I have been working in AWS a lot to try to develop some products.   How do I get back to my computer in terminal?  <answer285548> Somewhere, whether it be in a virtual network created in AWS or your company's own network, you are being assigned a hostname through a DHCP server (and possibly in conjunction with a RADIUS server).  Looking at the format of the assigned name, it's too specific (us-west-2.compute.internal), and the IP address and domain both point to eminternal/em networks.  You can manually set your hostname with the command:  codesudo scutil --set HostName "YourHostName"/code  However, when you reboot, it will revert back to whatever has been assigned to you.  Your best bet is to check with your network manager.  <comment360143> Possible duplicate of [Mac renames itself automatically - host name is incorrect in terminal](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28724/mac-renames-itself-automatically-host-name-is-incorrect-in-terminal) <comment360147> Thanks @Allan for keeping me honest! :) I've retracted the close vote. <comment360294> Sorry, I am new to this but this is my personal laptop and this is on my home network.  There is no network manager.  Is there a way to log out and log into my Mac?  Is there a way to prevent this from happening?
