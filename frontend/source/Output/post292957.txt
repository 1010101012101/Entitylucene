Problem with the force touch trackpad (not the usual one: sometimes doesn't click, but it selects) <body> I've read of some users having experienced that the Force Touch trackpad completely stopped working: that is, not only they can't click, but there's also no selection. In my case, the problem is different: the selection always works (the typical test I make is with Quicktime, where the fast forward button goes at different speeds in function of the pressure). What I'm missing is just the "click" feedback. But not always: in an intermittent fashion (I must also say that I have the strong impression that, when it works, it's less strong than when I bought my MacBook Pro). Intermittent at the level that it worked when I started typing this question, and doesn't work now that I'm reviewing it before posting.  I didn't pay attention when the problem arose - sometime in the past ten days. In the meantime two possibly relevant facts have been: I've applied some software updates and a few droplets of liquid dropped on the wrist rest pad, near the border of the trackpad. I'm unsure whether they reached the trackpad itself, but I promptly removed them.  The past year, a few days after buying my new MBP, a possibly related problem happened: it was a very warm and damp day, and my hands sweated at the point that there was liquid on the trackpad. It severely affected the pointer tracking, even after cleaning the thing from the external. I turned off the MBP for the whole day, and the day after everything was fine again.  Is there anything that can be tried e.g. such a reset that might work, or is it necessarily a hardware problem?  MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015).
