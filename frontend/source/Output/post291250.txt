Screen sharing from Mac to Android tablet <body> I want to use my Android Pixel tablet as a second screen for my Macbook Air, similar to how users of the app Duet use their iPad as a second screen for the Macbook. Is there any free/inexpensive app that does this?  <answer291254> I am not in anyway affiliated with the following company / developer but I think iDisplay might be the solution you're looking for. They have an application for Android as well.  <comment367763> That's the first app I too thought of
