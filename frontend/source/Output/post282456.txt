How to get Logitech mouse back and forward custom buttons working with Sierra? <body> I've been searching high and low for an answer. This all changed with a recent update to Sierra. I've got a M510 mouse. It's just the back and forward buttons that are not working. I tried using the older versions of the LCC Logitech Control but that didn't work. Also, I thought I'd try my Explorer Mini Mouse from Microsoft and those custom buttons didn't work either. I need my back and forward buttons.  <comment355804> Did you try asking Logitech? [I'll add more to that...] I've had a Logitech mouse for about 8 or 10 years. Logitech's support for it on Mac has always been ****. I've been using [SteerMouse](http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/) though I understand USB Overdrive has benefits too [never tried it] <comment355805> +1 for USB Overdrive. <comment355904> Are none of the LCC button changes working... or is it just the Back and Forward functions that don't work? Also, did you try to install the newest version of LCC? There seems to be [Sierra (10.12.) drivers for LCC](http://support.logitech.com/en_us/software/logitech-control-center-for-macintosh-os-x). <comment359769> It's strictly the back and forward buttons.  The newest version of LCC doesn't help.  Very frustrating and I'm no the only one with this issue!! <comment362771> Sorry, just to clarify... If you set those buttons to do anything else, do they work? Like if you can use the LCC software to set the back button to output a keystroke or anything really, I think there is a work around.  I've had a similar issue, where the back and forward functions didn't work, but replacing them with a custom shortcut helped. -- If you reply to this, write @Joonas in the message some place, so I get notified. <comment366886> I had the same issue but installing the latest LCC fixed it. Thanks @Joonas. <comment370694> Yes -- its just trying to program the back and forward options.  I can do other commands - just not back/forward. Do you have a custom shortcut where I can program one the buttons to "back"?  Thank you.
