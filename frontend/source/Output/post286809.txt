How to get OpenVPN details from macOS to iOS <body> I have a VPN which I connect to on my MacBook with Tunnelblick. I would like to setup my iPhone 6 to connect to the same VPN, however I am struggling to find an app or way to do this.  In Tunnelblick, I can see the configuration file which looks like this:  precodedev tun proto udp remote vpn.crmpicco.co.uk 1194 cipher AES-128-CBC auth SHA1 resolv-retry infinite nobind persist-key persist-tun client verb 3 auth-user-pass &lt;ca&gt;  [Security-related line(s) omitted] &lt;/ca&gt; &lt;cert&gt;  [Security-related line(s) omitted] &lt;/cert&gt;  &lt;key&gt;  [Security-related line(s) omitted] &lt;/key&gt; /code/pre  Can anyone advise me on how to connect to this VPN on iOS?  <answer286900> Assuming I understand your question correctly, you can use iTunes on the MacBook to transfer the profile you're using into OpenVPN on your iPhone.  Broadly speaking, you need to:  ol liDownload and install the OpenVPN app from the app store onto your iPhone/li liLocate the OpenVPN config file (it should have a .ovpn extension) you downloaded on your MacBook so you know where it is/li liConnect your iPhone to your MacBook/li liLaunch iTunes/li liSelect your iPhone (within iTunes)/li liClick on emApps/em on the left-hand menu/li liScroll to the bottom in the main window (on the right-hand side) and click on the OpenVPN icon in the emApps/em box /li liDrag and drop the OpenVPN config file (the one you located at Step 2) into the emOpenVPN Documents/em box/li liClick on kbdDone/kbd/li liOpen the OpenVPN app on your iPhone/li liYou should now see the new certificate listed/li liClick on the green kbd+/kbd sign/li liEnter your username, password etc/li liTap on the Save toggle/li /ol  Now when you want to connect to the VPN from your iPhone, just tap on the toggle that appears below the emDisconnected/em label. You emshould/em be connected shortly thereafter.  <comment362003> not *specifically* but have you gone into Settings  VPN and set it up there? you don't always need an app. IOS supports IKEv2, IPSec & L2TP VPNs out of the box. You will need connection info, username, authentication (cert or password). Your VPN provider should have that info. <comment362107> The VPN is OpenVPN which I don't see listed. I've updated my question as this is important.
