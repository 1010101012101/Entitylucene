Dock lost icons <body> Not quite sure what happened here, but my dock now looks as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6zkB.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any ideas?  <answer108653> Try to delete the Dock Preference setting, open strongTerminal/strong:  precodesudo rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist /code/pre  Enter your password.  Reboot your computer. The dock should now be back to the original (out-of-box) settings.  <answer237057> had the same problem, tried all the solutions proposed using terminal and commands.  Found the solution by just dropping the icon first on the desktop and then into the dock. Stayed there and was visible  <comment127357> Did you try `killall dock` in the terminal to restart it ?
