How can I add a path to the PATH environment variable? <body> I want to add a path to the codePATH/code environment variable?  I have tried with codeexport PATH=/mypath:$PATH/code and it works. But the next time I start the Terminal, my new path is not int the codePATH/code environment variable any more.  How can I add a path to the codePATH/codeenvironment variable? and it should be there also the next time I start the Terminal.  hr  I have problems with this now again, the trick that worked before doesn't seem to work anymore.  I have tried with:  precodeecho 'export GRADLE_HOME=/Users/jonas/gradle-1.2/' &gt;&gt; ~/.profile echo 'export PATH=GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.profile /code/pre  to add two environment variables. Then my code~/.profile/code-file has this content:  precodeexport GRADLE_HOME=/Users/jonas/gradle-1.2/ export PATH=GRADLE_HOME/bin:$PATH /code/pre  But when I start a new strongTerminal/strong window and type codegradle/code (the command I added to codePATH/code), I get a message that the command doesn't exists. If I run the command from code/Users/jonas/gradle-1.2/bin/code it works fine!  <answer12630> OSX reads the following files in order when a terminal opens :  precode/etc/profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login    ~/.profile      /code/pre  So place your path addition into one of these.  I normally put additions into code~/.bash_profile/code  <answer12636> In addition to the places mentioned by Â @RobZolkos, the login shell also looks in code/etc/paths/code and the files inside code/etc/paths.d//code. One path entry per line in these files.  See code/etc/profile/code and the manual page for codepath_helper/code.  <answer70621> codeecho 'export PATH=/my/path:$PATH' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile/code should do the trick!  If you used codeecho 'export PATH=/my/path:$PATH' &gt; ~/.bash_profile/code, or any such variation, you would be overwriting the contents of your profile!  <comment13218> Thanks, I used `echo 'export PATH=/mypath:$PATH'  ~/.profile` <comment13223> If you happen to screw something up, see also: [Reset your PATH variable](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/11745/1453) <comment13224> Ok, thanks! but the biggest problem was how to add the path. But I found `echo 'export PATH=/mypath:$PATH'  ~/.profile` <comment13225> @Jonas: I realized that your problem was solved. My answer was intended for the benefit of future readers, so they can see all the options available to them. <comment81955> The assignment to PATH (second export) should be with $GRADLE_HOME <comment81956> @patrix: Thanks, that fixed this problem!
