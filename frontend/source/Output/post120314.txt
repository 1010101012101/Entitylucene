How to have locatedb created / updated automatically? <body> I ran codelocate blob.txt/code and I got:  precode$ locate .bashrc  WARNING: The locate database (/var/db/locate.database) does not exist. To create the database, run the following command:    sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist  Please be aware that the database can take some time to generate; once the database has been created, this message will no longer appear. /code/pre  I ran this command and my locate database was built within a few minutes (includes tens of thousand of files).  On my Linux (Ubuntu) system my locatedb database is updated automatically by default, on a daily basis I believe.  How do I turn this on for my Mac?  <answer120318> When you run that command, launchd will update the database every week automatically. On my system, the plist is set to run every Saturday at 3:15am.  Edit from OP: Yes, works, note: Also it ran once when submitted, so for me, within a few minutes I was able to use codelocate/code.  the update process runs in the background so you may have to wait a few minutes before locate then works (You'll get the "codeThe locate database ... does not exist/code" message until then).  <answer120319> codecom.apple.locate.plist/code is a launch daemon with a predefined schedule:  precode&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;3&lt;/integer&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;15&lt;/integer&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Weekday&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;integer&gt;6&lt;/integer&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  This means that it runs every Saturday (codeWeekday/code=code6/code) at 3:15.  You can edit these values in the plist to modify the schedule to your liking. Removing the codeWeekday/code key will mean that it runs every day of the week, if you need it to run more often.  <comment140339> While this could work, did you consider using the spotlight feature to find a file : `mdfind -name blob.txt`? <comment140351> Interesting option.  I tend to stick to methods that will work pretty much the same in Ubuntu.  Best of all are tricks like alt-tab that work in all 3 OS's, i.e. Winodws too.
