Spotlight change keywords in Yosemite <body> Spotlight seems to always suggest the wrong thing and doesn't learn when I don't choose the Top Hit.  Is it possible to change the priorities of Spotlight? The internet suggests that there has been a way to edit keywords (or Spotlight comments) under "right click/Get Info". But there is no such thing here in Yosemite anymore.  <answer156892> Preferences - Spotlight - Search Results allows you to change the order of results by reordering categories.  As far as specific items within a category, this answer suggests that Spotlight is supposed to learn the Top Hit from what you choose over time: Changing OS X Spotlight priorities for specific applications.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LjWFM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment184485> If there's some better way I'd love to know.  Most people who address this sort of question say to use a third-party launcher, but Spotlight is getting quite capable and I personally found the launchers I tried to be too complex to get started easily (QuickSilver, which I had very high hopes for, and Alfred, which I also had high hopes for some months after giving up on QuickSilver). <comment184853> Just now I saw Spotlight learn a new top hit, so I can verify that it definitely learns in at least some cases. In this case it had previously learned a particular spreadsheet was a top hit, and quickly learned that I now favored a new version of it that had a different name. <comment185274> Top Hits are still on the top and are considered more important <comment185275> I assume your custom Top Hit didn't replace an apple program like iTunes. For example if I type in "music" iTunes will always show up first, no matter how often I pick the other result. <comment185723> Correct, it simply replaced a prior document I usually opened with a new one that I now favor. <comment233873> It looks like Apple programs _can_ be replaced as top hits in some instances. I'm trying to launch the App Store, however [typing "App" has Android Studio as a top hit](http://i.imgur.com/jd4frLu.png) for me. Typing "app" (note lowercase) gives App Store as top hit.
