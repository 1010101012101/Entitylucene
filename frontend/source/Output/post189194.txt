Ipad mini won't register for imessage <body> My wife and I just bought two Ipad mini 2's. We each have our own Apple IDs but when we try to use Imessage to send each other a message it states that the other's ID is not registered with Imessage. But I can send and receive messages with other ipads.  <comment224261> Is this the case even after verifying that iMessage has been tuned on in the settings? (Settings  Messages  iMessage slider set to on. Green) <comment224267> yes, I've toggled it on and off for both, I've updated them to the latest IOS. I've done what the apple site has recommend for other problems with Imessage. <comment240900> What's it say under Settings  Messages  Send & Receive?
