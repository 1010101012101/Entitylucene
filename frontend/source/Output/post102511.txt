Purchased music lost due to lack of space for iOS 7 update? <body> A few days ago I wanted to upgrade my iOS to version 7, but before I could do this I had to make room by deleting programs that didn't help so much.   So I was forced to delete my music library on my iPhone. And not really thinking about my new purchased music that hasn't been synchronized with iCloud or iTunes. So I lost my new music.   How do I get the music back without buying the music twice? I did a small test by buying one of the songs and Apple charged me again.  <answer102512> On your iOS 7 device :   ul liLaunch iTunes /li liGo to the "Other" tab/li liGo to purchased /li /ul  There you have the songs you buyed. You can download them again without Apple charging you again.   If Apple charged you again it's either :   ul liYou buyed an other version of the song/li liyou buyed it with another iTunes account /li /ul  <comment120680> Thank you very much :) I do not have access to my iMac until the 1st of October. I only have my iPhone. I opened iTunes on my iPhone and found 2 purchased songs. In other words I'm still missing about 70 songs. <comment120681> It was exactly the same song with the same account! ..but Apple charged me twice <comment120682> Does the song show up under the purchased music tab? Do the other 70 songs? <comment120684> The free song I got and the one just bought showed up on purchased, not the other 70 missing songs <comment120686> Maybe I will have to wait for access to my iMac.
