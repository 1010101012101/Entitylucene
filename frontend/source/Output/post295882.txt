Internet is not working on iPhone 5c <body> I have an iPhone 5c but my internet is not working. I reset network settings. Checked with services provider, they changed the SIM but issue is still there.  Any suggestions?  <comment373672> Can you give more information, what network are you on? Have the network provider given you APN settings for internet to work? <comment373680> Does wifi work, or no network at all?
