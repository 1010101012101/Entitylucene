Installed additional python2.7 to Snow Leopard. What happens to modules I want to install? <body> I recently asked if I should upgrade python 2.6 to python 2.71 on my Mac (Snow Leopard). I was told to install 2.7 without removing 2.6. strongDone!/strong  Now I was wondering how the installation of new modules is handled:  Does both 2.6 and 2.7 access the same place where all emnew/em python modules are installed by strongpip/strong, strongeasy_install/strong and strongsetup.py/strong? Is there something I have to take care of?  Another question occured to me: How do I tell a script that I have written to be run by python 2.7.2?  <answer17618> Install of python modules goes in x/Library/FrameworksPython.framework/Versions/2.6 etc where x depends on the install.  nothing for the one from Apple as port of OSX. python executable in /usr/bin  nothing for pythons from python.org. python executable in /usr/local/bin  /opt/local if installed via macports (as I do)  You have to look at easy_install etc to see the path to the python they use. e.g. /usr/bin/easy_install has /usr/bin/python so using this will install in /Library/FrameworksPython.framework/Versions/2.6.  You cannot choose to run under a minor version of  python e.g. 2.7.2 as only one major version at a time is set up normally e.g. 2.7.2 replaced 2.7.1 Each major version of python will have its own executable e.g. python2.7 s to have a script use that verstio make it begin with code#!/usr/bin/env python2.7/code pr the full path.  <comment19229> I have used virtual_env in the past to create virtual environments.  The nice thing about doing it this way, is that you can use 2.6 in one v_env and 2.7 (with/without certain modules) in another.  Check it out.
