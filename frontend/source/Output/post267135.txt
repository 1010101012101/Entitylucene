How to retrieve a video from iCloud? <body> I recently had to replace my phone. I supposedly had everything transferred to my new phone. I am trying to access a video I took that is very important and I don't know how to get it from my iCloud. Can someone help me?  <comment335107> Did you turn on iCloud backup for your photos **prior** to replacing your iPhone?  If so, if you log into iCloud.com is the video in your Photos?
