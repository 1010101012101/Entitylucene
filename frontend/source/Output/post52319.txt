10.7.4 changed my dock background—how do I change it back? <body> I upgraded to 10.7.4 and my dock on the bottom (with no enhancements) received this light/shadow box effect on startup. (It used to have no background.) I don't seen an option to remove it—is this a bug or a permanent change, and how can I easily revert it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4zy8.png" alt="shadow"  <answer52326> Try this:  ol liLaunch Terminal.app from /Applications/Utilities//li liType codedefaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean NO/code and press return./li liType codekillall Dock/code and press return./li /ol
