Odd text before ":" in Terminal <body> In Terminal.app I have a text prompt like the following  precoderover-205-89:Documents username$  /code/pre  What is the "rover-205-89"? I thought it was my computer name but I looked under System Preferences  Sharing and that isn't it.  <answer79185> That is your computer's stronghostname/strong. In Terminal type the command codehostname/code and that is what you'll see. You can change the host name with the command codesudo scutil --set HostName desired-host-name/code. There are some networking scenarios where this won't permanently fix the problem, though. (e.g. OS X assumes hostname of other network computer: how to prevent this?). It happens with my machine at work (on a Windows domain). Aside from being a little disconcerting, there are no functional repercussions that I've experienced.  <comment91529> Ok cause I noticed it happen when I joined a network,
