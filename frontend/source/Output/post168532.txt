I want to copy data from a text box under Settings, but drag and drop doesn't work. Is there a quick way to do it which is not OCR-ing the screen? <body> img src="https://i.imgur.com/SHHgrvg.png" alt="" This is the text box. They're iCloud abbreviations.  I want to export them, but I don't know how to do it.   Can someone help me?  <answer168537> Unfortunately, I don't know if there is a way to do it through the UI.    Good news, though, is that this is stored in code~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist/code. Here is a way to extract the information into a CSV file that you can open into a spreadsheet:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liCopy and paste the following line:  precodedefaults read -g NSUserDictionaryReplacementItems | gawk '/replace|with/ {s = substr($0, index($0, "= ")+2 ); gsub(";", "", s); printf "%s, ", s }; /^ *with/ {printf "\n"};' &gt; text.csv /code/pre/li liOpen codetext.csv/code with Numbers, LibreOffice, or Excel./li /ol  <comment197840> Yayyy!!! Thank you! You saved my life. I have more than 1000 abbreviations saved and I'm about to switch to an android phone. This means a lot!
