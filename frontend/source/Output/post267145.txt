Macbook Pro Mid 2014 stuttering and small lag spikes @ 4K 30Hz with HDMI 2.0/1.4b <body> So the limit of the Macbook Pro mid 2014 is 3840x2160 at 30 Hz through HDMI 2.0 (I guess it's only 1.4b). When I fire up VLC and look on my Macbook, the image is clear and there is no stutering what so ever. It runs butter smooth. When I look at my TV, however, the quality is still very, very good, but the video stutters all the time. It's like a bungee/elastic effect when there's a panorama shot, and when there's a rolling shot going very fast, it's like watching 10 FPS clips.  I can see my Macbook Pro uses the integrated 750M graphics card, and it does get quite hot.  What's the issue here?
