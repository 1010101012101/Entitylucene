How to block certain IP/MAC Address that access your WiFi Network ? <body> I can see people access into my Wifi by going into AirportUtility Here is a list of people that are connected to Wifi at the moment.   There're 2 of them in there that I'm not sure - how they get in there ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCDaB.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Goals/h2  ul liI would like to both of them out./li liI also want to block a certain MAC Address for future access./li /ul  h2What I have tried/h2  I've been playing around with the AirPort Utility, and all I can do is restrict the time access to a certain MAC address.  I also came across an app called Little Snitch, but that not exactly what I want.  Is there any Mac App that let me block/allow a certain IP address ?   <answer166398> On your airport extreme you can block certain mac address for good with "No Access".  In your airports configuration go to the "Network" tab and check "Enable Access Control", then click on "Timed Access Control".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g01Xo.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then on the top add the mac address you want to prohibit and give it a description.  Towards the bottom, On the "Wireless Access Time" drop down select "No Access" and save.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTjK2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Confirmed this works on a 5th generation airport running version 7.6.4  <answer166407> I'm not sure of any Mac programs, but try calling up your ISP (Internet Service Provider) and they might be able to block those devices. It's worth a shot.  <answer166408> to easily disallow any or all others from accessing your network, change your network password in Airport Utility. there's no need to block or allow IPs or MAC addresses IF there's trust for those with password access.  ol liopen AU/li liselect your primary device/li liit should open a new window with the Base Station tab selected by default/li lienter or change password /li linotify others of the change, login with qualified devices/li /ol  you can also create a guest network with separate password if you wish via the Guest tab. Good luck!  <comment195013> what version is your AirPort running?
