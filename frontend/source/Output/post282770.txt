Mounting Samba shares under /Volumes without GUI fluff <body> I know I can mount Samba share using either codemount/code or codeopen/code command from the terminal shell. See this related question: How can I mount an SMB share from the command line?. I prefer using codeopen/code because it mounts the shared folder under code/Volumes/code which seems kind of OS X standard, the expected thing. Namely this happens by typing  precodeopen "smb://guest:@${host}/${path_component}" /code/pre  (where code${host}/code is the host name or IP address of the Samba share and code${path_component}/code is the path or "name" of the Samba share).  The result and the main thing is that I can access the stuff from code/Volumes/${path_component}/code. This is very nice indeed. Just there are two problems or nuisance doing this from within scripts. The first is that this will open a superfluous progress indicator and then Finder window. The second, lesser one as there are scriptable work-arounds, is that the command returns immediately without waiting for the mount to be really available.  Is there a way to (synchronously) mount Samba shares under code/Volumes/code without extraneous windows popping up?  (I am using the latest OS X (Sierra).)  <answer282778> The following is what I use to mount Samba shares via codelaunchd/code:  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e "try" -e "mount volume \"smb://guest@${host}\"" -e "end try" /code/pre  Using codeosascript/code's codemount/code means any codekeychain/code access needed is done "automagically", there's no progress indicator or Finder window, and the command waits for the mount to be available before proceeding (try it with code&amp;&amp; echo -n "Done."; mount/code appended to the end of the above command to test this).  <comment356366> OSA script? That's some weird stuff, but it works just like I want it to! Thanks! <comment356464> @FooF osascript is the command line interface for AppleScript.
