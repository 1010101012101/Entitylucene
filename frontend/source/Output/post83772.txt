How to create an alias with drag and drop? <body> In MacOSX, when dragging a file or folder one can force a copy instead of a move by pressing kbdoption/kbd. I think that there used to be a way to alternatively create an alias but can't find which key to press.  Which key to press when dragging in order to create an alias ?   <answer83773> Hold down kbd cmd /kbd and kbd option /kbd when dragging.   <answer83774> You have to press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdalt/kbd while dragging  <comment329448> if don't work in Finder window, try to drag first then hold the two buttons. At least in my case it don't work if I hold the two buttons in first hand inside a Finder window.
