Disk utility, shrink 1 partition, expand the other <body> I have two partitions on my external HDD, I shrinked 1 partition (Macintosh Lion) in order to expand the other (Macintosh HD), but I can't drag the lower right corner to expand of the 'Macintosh HD' partition, I can only do it with the 'Macintosh Lion' one, ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MkVmT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19611> Yes, you are restricted in that sense, you can only modify the partition space "at the end" of the disk, as you have discovered.  <answer19646> Yes, Disk Utility can’t edit space in the “middle” of the disk, only space on the “ends”.  There is an app called iPartition that sounds like it does what you need. From the website:     iPartition makes it easy to create, destroy, resize or format partitions on your hard disks, whether internal, external, fixed or removable.   Two caveats: first, I’ve never used iPartition myself, so I can’t comment on its reliability. I’ve used their other product (iDefrag), which was very stable and I’d recommend, but not iPartition. Also, according to archived blog post, iPartition doesn’t work with Lion FileVault partitions. Don’t know if that affects you.  <comment19576> Same issue, did you ever figure it out? <comment27117> Added the picture for you. May not show up for awhile; I don't have edit privileges yet.
