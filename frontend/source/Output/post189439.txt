How to link multiple key events in AppleScript? <body> I have been trying to write an AppleScript that would open the mail app register a save as key event (Shift+Command+S) wait 1.5 seconds, do a return key event ("Enter") and then wait another 1 second and then register a down arrow key event.  precodeactivate application "Mail" repeat 2310 times     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "s" using {shift down,command down}     delay 1.5     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "return"     delay 1     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "DownArrow" end repeat /code/pre  <answer190077> precodetell application "System Events" to repeat 2310 times     tell application process "Mail" to set frontmost to true     keystroke "s" using {shift down, command down}     delay 1.5     keystroke return     delay 1     key code 125 end repeat /code/pre  <comment224661> Can you add the code that you have written already? <comment224664> @grgarside Added <comment224824> Since Mail.app can be scripted, I don't think you should use UI scripting but script Mail.app directly - to get an idea, open Mail.app with Script-Editor. + Script-Editor has a template for a "Mail Rule Action" (see menu File) and this is maybe even a way to goâ€¦ (in Mail, we can apply a rule to a selection. Rules can be created in Mail's Preferences and they can run scripts). http://google.com/search?q=Mail.app+saving+emails+with+applescript
