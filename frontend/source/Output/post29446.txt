Prevent dictionary from coming up in Lion <body> On Lion, a three finger double tap brings up the dictionary. The problem is I have to disable this feature on multiple Macs and cannot be done by clicking on each system. How can this be achieved? Can I use a script? Is there a table with all the multi-touch commands? And maybe I could disable it there?  <answer29478> This applescript will turn the option off. Make sure that access for assistive devices is turned on, which is found in Universal access.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane "Trackpad"     tell application "System Events"         tell process "System Preferences"             if window 1's tab group 1's checkbox 3's value is 1 then                 tell window 1's tab group 1's checkbox 3 to click             end if         end tell     end tell     quit end tell /code/pre  <comment33815> You can definitely use a script, but I don't know how to disable the commands.
