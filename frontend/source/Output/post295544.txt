How do I add a folder to the Library using a UNIX command? <body> I need to add a folder to /user/username/Library/Application Support/Google, on a number of computers.  Is there a way to do it with a UNIX command in ARD, so I don't have to touch each machine?  <answer295551> The command to create a folder is:  precodemkdir "/Users/myuser/Library/Application Support/Google/MyFolder" /code/pre  (you'll need to substitute your own folder name ofcourse)  <answer295552> It sure is!  codemkdir '/Users/username/Library/Application Support/Google/whatever'/code  Replace 'username' and 'whatever' appropriately, of course. Also, note that if anything in the path contains single quotes (apostrophes), you'll need to replace each one with code'\''/code – I'm using single quotes here to take care of any other quoting issues, and this will end the quote string, put in a quote, and start another (Single-quoted strings don't accept emany/em form of escape, even escaping a single quote!).  For more information on this command, type codeman mkdir/code in Terminal.  For more information on shell quoting, type codeman bash/code in Terminal, then use code/quoting/code to search for "quoting"—this should get you to the appropriate section.  <comment373408> Thanks a lot for that! <comment373409> Thanks a lot!
