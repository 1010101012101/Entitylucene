Can you make the menu bar never show while in full screen already? <body> 4 years ago, I asked if it is possible to stop the menu bar from showing while in full screen. The issue is that, on tabbed applications, whenever I try to click a tab, the menu bar appears above it causing me to click in the wrong place. Half a decade later and I'm still deeply frustrated with this issue. Is there any way to do it yet?  Here is what I am talking about:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJonR.png" alt="Menu bar appearing on tabbed applications"  <answer240674> One possible workaround... Go into System Preferences. Select "General." Towards the top, there is a place you can set the menu bar to "Automatically hide and show the menu bar."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kQfmG.png" alt="screencap"  <comment295910> Not that I know of. :/ <comment295919> But that still causes the menu bar to sneak in when I try to click a tab on chrome full screen... <comment295927> Ah, I see. I will continue to see what I can find. <comment296989> The menu bar is essential  for an application. I think  that Apple will not give a way to do this until all of the computers will be tablets. <comment297016> Can't you hide the menu bar with OS X el Capitan?
