Note: Pressing Volume Up for safe mode doesn't work either.  <answer194976> Woah dude. You are in a mess! Unfortunately, you cannot get it into restore mode without that home button working. What I think you should do is if you are brave enough is to buy a cheap repair kit online and attempt to fix your button. If it doesn't work, no harm done cause its out of warranty! Go for it man and good luck.  <answer196718> You can try the following that helped me fix my homebutton thing on my iPhone 4. But WARNING - it only fixes MECHANICAL issues, not software issues! If this is not your case or your button is really physically broken, don't try this at home and downvote me! :-)  ol liSwitch off the phone and pull out your SIM card./li liBuy medical alcohol in a pharmacy with a very high percentage, at least 97% (in Germany it is called Isopropanol or Isopropyl alcohol)./li liTake a pipette and drop a few drops onto the home button, so the button is completely covered in it./li liPress and release the button at least 50 times, starting slow and increasing speed. /li liAdd more alcohol, but less and carefully, only a few drops! don't drain your phone!/li liStart pressing and releasing again at least another 50 times./li liIt should be very easy now to press the button./li liLet the iPhone dry and recover for at least 8h./li liPut in again your SIM card and power on the phone./li liFeel happy with a recovered home button. :-)/li /ol  After your home button is working again, try again your previous steps for recovering your phone.  <comment231999> Can someone please help? I'd much appreciate it!
