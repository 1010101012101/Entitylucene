Small centered apps on iPhone 4 after install iOS 7.1.2 <body> I've got a problem with some of my apps on my iPhone 4 including Facebook. When I open them they show their start screen and then they shrink to 1/4 of the size and are centered on the screen.  I tried everything (or almost), safe mode with volume up when restart,  reset all configurations, restore with phone and iTunes (and other things I can't remember), I don't know more what to do.  <answer211995> Today i tried again with Itunes, full restore. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/58nma.png" alt="this is what realy happen"  <comment255708> When did you install iOS 7.1.2? If recently, where did you get it from? And can you add a screenshot showing the effect?
