Is it possible to use airdrop on iphone4? <body> I have ipad mini and iphone 4 and i want to transfer some music from ipad to iphone. Is it possible to use Airdrop?  <answer116583> No, the hardware radio doesn't work in the manner needed for AirDrop to function.  See the fine print of http://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/#airdrop which states:  h2AirDrop is available on iPhone 5 or later, iPad (4th generation), iPad mini, and iPod touch (5th generation) and requires an iCloud account/h2  <answer116584> No, you can't use Airdrop with an iPhone 4: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5887  While your iPad mini supports AirDrop, the your iPhone 4 does not - and as far as I'm aware, music can't be transferred via AirDrop.  That said, for $25/year, you can turn on iTunes Match, which will put a copy of your iTunes library in iCloud, allowing you to access your music anywhere. You can also transfer the music by using a Mac.  <comment136366> does Airdrop use wifi or Bluetooth? even in the case if it works with Bluetooth? <comment136367> It is WiFi file exchange using an ad-hoc, non router based 802.11 protocol. Think of it as a mesh network that doesn't care whether any of the devices are connected to any or the same WiFI network. I believe bluetooth is only used to negotiate the wireless connection and not transfer files, but I don't have a reference or any facts behind that belief. <comment136368> Good answer on iTunes Match. It's less flexible than if you could "beam" a song to another device without being connected to the internet, but it is available today and works quite well for many people's needs.
