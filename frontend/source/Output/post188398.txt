Can one create a multi-partition USB Stick with Mavericks, Yosemite, Snow Leopard installers? <body> Does anyone have any experience creating a multi-partition USB Stick with bootable partitions for installing Mavericks, Yosemite and Snow Leopard?   I have a 32Gb stick I'd be perfectly willing to devote to this venture - if such a thing is even possible to create.  I have experience creating a singular Mavericks installer USB Stick - but does Option-booting a Mac allow for booting from multiple partitions?  <answer188530> While I do not have experience with this particular method O/S X can easily boot from multi partitions on strongany/strong media. It does to matter if it is a USB key, a Thunderbolt RAID array or whatever. Holding down the option key will give you all bootable partitions available to the Mac at boot.  <answer188804> Okay.. Apple have a perfectly workable website titled "Create a bootable installer for OS X" ( https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372 )  Which tells you what to do via the Terminal, once you have successfully downloaded Install OS X El Capitan.app, Install OS X Yosemite.app and Install OS X Mavericks.app.  Their instructions are as follows:  strongEDIT: note, added macOS Sierra, which works with the same method - but is not listed on their website/strong  strongmacOS Sierra/strong  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app /code/pre  strongOS X El Capitan/strong  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app /code/pre  strongOS X Yosemite/strong  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Yosemite.app /code/pre  strongOS X Mavericks/strong  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app /code/pre  I was able to use these commands from the Terminal, onto a Disk Utility -made 5 partition USB stick. I verified it with option-down-during-boot (alt-down-during-boot) and both of them booted up fine.  I was unable to find an OS X Snow Leopard installer from my hard drive or elsewhere, so I'm considering this question answered.  Note: Mountain Lion installer app does not have "createinstallmedia" like Yosemite+Mavericks do, hence I didn't install that one on a USB stick - for that, one would have to use a secondary set of instructions for installing the installer to a USB stick via the usual way (Disk Utility, mounting, copying, copying some more..)  <answer188829> Yes - it is possible. I have a USB drive with bootable OS X versions from 10.6 to 10.10.  ol liUse disk utility to create the partitions you need. Under codePartition/code you can choose the number of desired partitions. Make sure you select the codeGUID Partition Table (GPT)/code in Options./li liUse a tool like DiskMaker X to create the OS X drives for you. For OS X 10.9 and 10.10 can also use the method described by @esaruoho./li liPress kbdalt/kbd during boot and select the partition you want. /li /ol  NB: Your Mac will only boot the partitions that it can actually handle. E.g. a recent Mac will not boot 10.7.  <comment251265> You will find a procedure to create such a bootable drive here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106112/11600 <comment324546> Hi n1000 - DiskMakerX unfortunately wipes all the partitions of a USB stick before starting the process. So DiskMakerX is unfortunately not a good solution, unless if you plan on having one USB stick per one OS X.
