Trouble with encrypted SD card <body> I recently encrypted a SD card with disk utility to secure some of my most precious files, with a password. I then renamed the SD card, and then copied the files to it. The trouble is, that when I unplugged my sd and plugged it back, the password I did set didn't work anymore. I guess it's because I changed the name of my card. I tried many things with the terminal, but I can't get anywhere. Does anybody have an idea that could get me out of this trouble, cause those files are really important to me, I'd be desperate to lose access to them forever.  Many thanks in advance,
