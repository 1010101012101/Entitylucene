Mac lost internet connection on upload <body> I have a strange issue which is driving me crazy...When uploading files (in my case its to Flickr) after a few uploads my internet connection kinda fades away :S Cannot open any web page. It looks I have an ip address and everything looks ok but the only soluton to this is to resetart my mac  I tried Mediashare but did not notice any problems. It sounds funny that if I say only my Flickr uploads cause problem but...I could not name it another way :)  Any way to diagnose my problem? So that I can find a solution to it.  I am using a Macbook Pro 17" with 10.8.3 on it.  Thank you for your comments.  Btw, MAC 's network problem diagnostics is much far better than Mac OS :(  <comment108418> Just a wild guess - but are you uploading throuh WLan? I had a cheap monitor adapter that would cause so much interference on Wifi channel 13 that no packets would go through. Maybe one of your cable is bad too. Try without or change the wifi channel then. <comment108487> Also now after your comment, I have tried on wireless and problem did not happen at all. But isn't it strange that there is no problem on download (cause I surf for days and nothing happens) but on upload it suddenly happens:S <comment108488> Yah - just imagine how long it took me to figure out that my monitor cable was source of my network failures... It's kinda Murphys law :)
