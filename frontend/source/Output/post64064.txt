So it's something like this: AirPort Extreme  (0x14E4, 0xD6)? <comment75192> Yes, that's the card name itself. Below that, you'll see `Firmware Verison` which is also important to note, since that has to do with the card & performance. <comment75282> Yep, what @SoFLy said <comment249893> What if my Wi-Fi section is blank?
