Swap CMD and Alt only on external keyboard <body> On my external mechanical keyboard the Super/Windows/CMD key is between Ctrl and Alt, but on the Mac keyboard it's between Alt and Space.   Can I swap CMD and Alt strongonly/strong on the external keyboard?  <answer225097> I use Karabiner for my external KB, I think it's the only utility currently available but Google is your friend. As to the second question - so far as I know, only if you can figure out a way to run Karabiner when the external KB is attached but not otherwise. HTH.  <answer225127> There is a section dedicated to this under strong/strong → strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongKeyboard/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKyol.png" alt="Keyboard"  Open strongModifier Keys…/strong and reassign them from here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EGfje.png" alt="Modifier Keys"  These settings are specific to each external keyboard you have connected. They will “stick” between reboots, as well as whenever you unplug an external keyboard and plug back it in.  <comment273156> The central problem is I want a solution that doesn't require me to reconfigure something every time I connect my external keyboard. I haven't found a solution on google, that's why I'm asking here.
