MacBook won't boot from internal SSD <body> I got a 2011 MacBook Pro and had a Samsung 840 Pro installed running Mountain Lion, then Mavericks for about a year without any problems. Without any apparent reason the MBP just wouldn't boot from the SSD anymore, reinserting the old HDD worked instantly. After playing around a bit I made the following observations about the MBP:  ol liwon't boot from the SSD even after cloning the HDD or making a clean reinstall/li linot even able to get to the boot menu when the SSD is installed/li lican boot from the SSD when it is connected via USB and the HDD is used to get to the boot menu/li licannot boot from any other SSD (tried one from another MBP and also a completely new one)/li /ol  Any ideas?  <comment171544> Reset your SMC and EFI. And check your SSD connection cable, it might be bad. <comment334705> I have the same problem, trying to boot from SSD always results in a kernel panic. Resetting SMC didn't work, and I don't have an EFI password set. Are there any other options to fix it (possibly a TRIM issue? I tried enabling and disabling trimforce, but I had no luck). Thank you!
