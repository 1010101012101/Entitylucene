How can I fix my $PATH variable? <body> I need to revert my $PATH back to the default.  The catch here is that I broke it so bad that the codeecho $PATH/code command returns: code/usr//code that's it, which means I can't use any of the methods described in other answers basically because any command returns "unknown command".  I can't vi, I can't nano, I can't do squat over Terminal. All of that was working before I broke $PATH so I'm sure its all path related.  <answer127804> This depends how you changed your path.  ul liIf you changed it in your shell, just close the window and open a new shell./li liIf you changed it in a profile, change it there./li /ul  Your path should look something like this:  precodePATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  <comment149742> And `export` is a shell builtin, so you can simply restore PATH to a saner state with `export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin` (If you're a tcsh user, `setenv PATH …` would be the equivalent). <comment149744> OMFG THANK YOU IT WORKED!!! <comment149756> @Camila Per your edit in reply, I'm a bit confused — it didn't work? Could you clarify?
