Can anything cause the battery “cycles count” to appear LOWER than it really is? <body> My Macbook battery is essentially dead. It has behaved erratically for the past 1.5 year. In any case I checked the cycle count today and found only 270 something. If I recall correctly, I had much more than this before and I've used the Macbook for almost 5 years with the same battery. I think the cycle count somehow got reduced.  Has this happened to anyone else?
