Apple Photo not importing from iPhone <body> Photo on my Mac is not importing from my iPhone anymore. I have more than 4000 photos imported, but now Photo tells me that the file format of the last 20+ photos is not recognized or contains invalid data. On the screen of Photo I do see these photos on my iPhone. If I disconnect the iPhone and reconnect and restart Photo, some will be loaded, but not all. What is the catch here? See below error message: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SkM3I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment334915> Can you help us out by translating the error message as well as the text to the right of the image names?
