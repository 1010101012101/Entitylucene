Remove old iCloud email address on iPad <body> I have an iPad that is running iOS 9.3.5. In Settings, under the "iCloud" header, there is an old/non-existent email address. I cannot figure out where to remove it.  On my other devices, it shows the correct email address, iTunes, etc...  How do I get rid of this old email address on my iPad?  <comment335437> As asked, your question is not totally clear as to in what way you aren't able to sign out of the account. You should be able to click Sign Out at the bottom of iCloud settings, but if not, your question might already be answered in [one](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/210728/12285) of [these](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/211906/12285) questions.
