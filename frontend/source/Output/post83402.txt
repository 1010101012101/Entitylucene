Mount SMB share without 2GB filesize limit on OSX Lion <body> I want to mount a network attached drive onto OSX Lion with Samba.  Usually I do this in Finder with "GoConnect to Server" and type "smb://192.xxx.xx.xxx" in the Server Adress field, however doing this i ran into a problem with transfering files larger than 2GB (SMB limit).  To bypass this issue I need to mount the drive with LFS (Large File Support), there are many posts online that show how to do this in terminal in Linux, but I cannot find nowhere how to do it in OSX. How can I do this?  Thanks!  <answer84702> Since Lion, OS X does not come with Samba, but with another implementation of SMB/CIFS.  OS X documentation does not have an option for large file.  You perhaps simply need to update your OS X installation. I have OS X Mountain Lion, and files of 3GB are copied over SMB without trouble. Either you need to upgrade to Mountain Lion or to a newer Lion release.  Other possibility, your server does not support large file and needs an upgrade.
