Toggle Hidden Files without Relaunching Finder <body> I'm pretty new here, and I looked for an answer to this question, and found some answers but none seemed to work for me.    I want to be able to run an applescript that toggles hidden files and immediately updates all the open finder windows.  Using the scripts in these threads:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29135878/what-is-the-quickest-way-to-toggle-hide-show-hidden-files-on-a-mac-os-x-yosemite  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21788558/automator-command-to-refresh-all-finder-all-finder-windows  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20469894/how-to-make-a-script-to-show-hide-hidden-files-in-mac-os-x  I've come up with something that looks like this:  precodetry     set state to (do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles") as boolean on error     set state to false end try  do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; (not state)  tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view         end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  However, as of my version of OS X (10.11.5), this doesn't actually toggle the hidden files.  I need to relaunch finder in order to see the changes.  I know how to do this in the script with: codedo shell script "killall Finder"/code, but I don't know how to get all my current windows back and repositioned to where they were.  strongTL;DR/strong: Is there a nice way to force the Finder windows to refresh without having to relaunch Finder?  Or if there isn't, how can I keep my windows after a restart?  <answer243674> The trick of switching views worked well in Yosemite but no longer in El Capitan.  I've had to go back to the simple, yet annoying  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState &amp; "; killall Finder" /code/pre  Rather than the much nicer version which worked before   precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState      tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  emHonestly, I'd love this answer to be wrong/em  BTW, Windows ought to reopen exactly where they were - but not if you have them spread over more than one Space; that's not possible.  <comment305985> so if i understand correctly, pre-OS 10.11 with Tetsujin's first script, you COULD show/hide the hidden files withOUT the Finder relaunching, but you cannot post-OS 10.10? that seems ridiculous (IMO). how come apps like Panic's Transmit FTP program can show/hide without relaunching it & the Finder can't? would LOVE to find an app to simply toggle this in ONE Finder window, not all.
