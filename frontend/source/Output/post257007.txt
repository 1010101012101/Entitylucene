How to use iOS device as a Bluetooth controller for Android device? <body> I was wondering if there's an app that allows an iOS device to be used as a Bluetooth controller for an Android device.  I've seen this setup made possible in a game, BombSquad. My Android device was running the game, while my iPod touch ran the controller app made by the same developer.  Is a way to have a similar, yet more universal setup? I imagined this being realized one of 2 ways:  ol liAn iOS app that emulates a normal Bluetooth controller/li liAn iOS app that connects to an Android receiver app, similar to what Joypad Legacy and Ultimate Gamepad do for iOS/PC connections./li /ol  Do either of these exist? I've searched but I cannot seem to find a solution.  Thanks in advance!  <comment320719> Not sure about bluetooth, so I suggest DLNA instead. I am able to remote control my LG tv via iPhone with that.
