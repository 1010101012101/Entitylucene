How can I route two audio sources simultaneously as inputs to Skype? <body> I am attempting to route my mic audio and system output so both can be heard through Skype.  Any ideas?  <answer22474> h2SoundFlower/h2  This is the traditional solution, and it is free. Although I am not sure if it's compatible with Lion.  Once you have it installed, you'll need to get familiar with the Mac OS X system utility, Audio MIDI Setup, in the Utilities folder.  <answer22510> Maybe an aggregated device ? I use it for outputs, but it seems that you can also configure 2 inputs. See this Apple's kb article : http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3956  <comment24978> What input are you using? <comment24980> Yah I downloaded it a while back, but still it was hard to get all the audio right.  But I think I got it. <comment24981> What operating system are you running? Snow Leopard? Lion? <comment25000> Snow Leopard.  But I got everything working with SoundFlower and LineIn.  What I ended up doing is using LineIn to send my mic input to output to SoundFlower and I set my computers output in System Preferences to SoundFlower.  From SoundFlower I set the output to my speakers.  And in Skype I set my mic as SoundFlower.
