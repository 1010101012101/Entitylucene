Email notification issues (iPhone 4S with ios 5.1.1) <body> I have 5 email accounts on my iPhone 4S.  One is my work email and is on a Microsoft Exchange.  The other 4 are personal accounts and are Gmail accounts.  I have turned on notifications so I will be notified of incoming emails.  The only account that sends me notifications is my work email.  Apple tells me that all accounts should be sending me notifications and that I may need a technician to complete a software configuration.  I have only had the phone 3 days and Apple wants to charge me $59 for them to reconfigure their software issue.  Has anyone else run into this issue, and if so, how have you been able to work around or correct the problem?  Thanks  <answer58924> Are you setting up your Gmail accounts as "exchange accounts? If not I would recommend doing so. Here is a quick walk trough. http://email.about.com/od/iphonemailtips/ss/Set_Up_Push_Gmail_in_iPhone_Mail_Step_by_Step_Screenshots.htm  <answer58934> Gmail is configured as IMAP by default on iOS. Google conveniently provides an article to help configure Push Mail, but it doesn’t work for me. Probably I was doing it wrong or because I turn off data all the time. Cody’s link looks useful, but it’s for iOS 3.0.  <comment67889> What is email set to in Settings  Notifications? And by notifications, I'm guessing that would mean alerts on the lock screen (like SMS defaults)? If that's the case, as I understand it, those alerts are only appearing for your Exchange account. Do the badges show the correct amount of email? 1 other thing - if you bought the phone new, three days ago, you have at least Apple phone support - you could schedule a Genius app. and they should be able to help as well.
