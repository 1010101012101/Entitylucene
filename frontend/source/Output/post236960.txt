Should there be a hardlink from `/Users/Users` pointing to `/Users`? <body> This is was my code/Users/code directory looks like. That codeUsers/code link doesn't seem quite right..  precodematt@viking Users $ pwd /Users  matt@viking Users $ ls -lA total 8 -rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel      0 22 Aug  2015 .localized drwxr-xr-x+ 11 Guest  _guest   374 11 Nov 18:40 Guest drwxrwxrwt   5 root   wheel    170 12 Nov 06:42 Shared lrwxr-xr-x   1 root   admin      6 12 Nov 23:10 Users -&gt; /Users drwxr-xr-x+ 14 dave   staff    476  2 May 21:59 dave drwxr-xr-x+ 87 matt   staff   2958  2 May 22:09 matt  matt@viking Users $ /code/pre  You can then of course go on to do silly things like this..  precodematt@viking Users $ cd Users/Users/Users/Users/Users/Users  matt@viking Users $ pwd /Users/Users/Users/Users/Users/Users/Users  matt@viking Users $ ls -lA total 8 -rw-r--r--   1 root   wheel      0 22 Aug  2015 .localized drwxr-xr-x+ 11 Guest  _guest   374 11 Nov 18:40 Guest drwxrwxrwt   5 root   wheel    170 12 Nov 06:42 Shared lrwxr-xr-x   1 root   admin      6 12 Nov 23:10 Users -&gt; /Users drwxr-xr-x+ 14 dave   staff    476  2 May 21:59 dave drwxr-xr-x+ 87 matt   staff   2958  2 May 22:09 matt  matt@viking Users $ /code/pre  It doesn't seem like the codeUsers/code link should be there, there's a good chance I created it myself by accident; I just can't help but think some service or other might be relying on it being there.  Can I just delete it?  <answer236962> There should not be a link like that. If you truly have a hard link, that's something that's a bit self-referential, snake eating it's own tail recursion, so I'd make sure you have a backup if you're not sure you're deleting the correct link.  From your listing - the link count is 1 so it's probably a sym link and not even a hard link - which means it's safer to delete in reality than in theory above.  I would expect a 2 between the permissions codelrwxr-x-ry-x/code and coderoot/code owner if you had a hard link there.  <comment290094> Is there a reason why you need to delete it? If not just leave it. And sorry for posting a comment in an answer, I'm not allowed to comment yet... <comment290098> The "l" in the first column of the `ls -l` listing indicates that it's a symbolic link -- a hard link would have a "d" there (since a hard link is really just the item itself, and in this case the item is a directory). <comment290108> @Gordon Davisson, From the `ln` man page, "_Hard links may not normally refer to directories and may not span file systems._", so if it starts with a `d`, e.g. `drwxr-xr-x` it **is** just a directory, not a hard link as hard links of directories are not supported. If you even try to hard link a directory you'll get an message saying `ln: source_file Is a directory` and it doesn't create it. <comment290110> @user3439894 That's true on most unixes, but OS X has supported hard-linked directories (on Mac OS Extended volumes) since v10.5, and uses them extensively in Time Machine backups. <comment290114> @GordonDavisson, TM does make extensive use of hard links with _files_, more so then hard links of _directories_, as verified by using `ls -li` to get the _inode number_. I reviewed the last 6 months of my TM backups there were a few _directories_ that share the same _inode number_ but consistently the top level _directories_ of the Macintosh HD did not have the same _inode number_ and are not hard links. That said, let me rephrase part of my last comment and say OS  X does not permit the User to create hard links of _directories_ using the `ln` command, it only allows hard links of _files_. <comment290115> You, or someone, created it and it is a symbolic link and can be safely deleted. OS X does not permit the User to create hard links of _directories_ using the `ln` command, it only allows hard links of _files_.
