How to map the F11 and F12 keys to Volume Up/Volume Down <body> I have chosen to use the F1-F12 keys with their original -PC- behavior, because I want F5 to refresh the page in Firefox! (and not control the backlight of the keyboard)  Now I would like to "remap" the Volume Up/Volume Down key as originaly intended: F11 and F12 keys (I'm used to that). I don't want to have to press Fn everytime.  I've searched everywhere I can't find a way to do that (for now I have to press Fn+F11 and Fn+F12).  <answer26938> With FunctionFlip, you can individually remap the function keys.  <comment30792> Are you sure about that? I've installed it but I didn't find the option to remap a *specific* function key (only possible to remap all FX keys). I'm not home right now, I'll check later. <comment30801> @Matthieu Brain fart - it's FunctionFlip (see answer edit). I don't have it on my home computer, only my work Mac, so I misremembered the name. <comment30802> Excellent! This is *exactly* what I'm looking for. I hope I wont have conflicts with KeyRemap4Macbook, but i won't be using it for functions keys so it should be ok.
