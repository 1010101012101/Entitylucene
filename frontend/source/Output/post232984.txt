How can I remove project form project list on XCode Welcome screen? <body> I have an XCode project that I tried to delete manually, and I did delete it, but some reference is left - apparently. This reference is making this project still display on the Welcome screen of XCode (XCode version 7.3) on El Capitan. If I try to double click on this non-existing project I get message in a popup "The file 'project.xcworkspace' doesn’t exist." and after that, when I click OK in that popup, I get another popup with message "The file 'Skocko.xcodeproj' doesn’t exist." How can I completely remove this project and not have it on Welcome page, since it is very confusing issue?  <answer232989> Open Xcode and go to codeFile --&gt; Open Recent/code.  From there select codeClear Menu/code.  This will remove the shortcut to your most recent projects.  Close Xcode and reopen it.  Skocko project should be gone from the Welcome screen.  <comment284777> Great, all the other projects recently opened are gone too, but this is not an issue, I can reopen them. Thanks!
