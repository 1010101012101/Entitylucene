Mounted and working disk partition reports as "no filesystem", Spotlight won't index <body> TL/DR: encrypted separate disk partition for /Users won't index  After installing too many junky apps, especially system monitors - I decided to reinstall.  I grabbed a USB external 1TB drive, backed up my main internal (815 GB used of 1 TB), and erased it.  I partitioned my internal drive and reinstalled macOS Sierra on the smaller main partition.  Then after googling for the best way to do it, I added the second partition as /Users to code/etc/fstab/code using emvifs/em. After some undesired juggling of accounts and locations - including putting an admin account elsewhere on the primary partition - my user account was working fine under /Users on the secondary partition.  Then I clicked on the disk in Finder and selected 'Encrypt.'  Well, not completely.  Spotlight simply won't touch the /Users partition.  Here is my codediskutil list/code output:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Beornholm               62.9 GB    disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS                         62.4 GB    disk0s4    5:          Apple_CoreStorage                         873.8 GB   disk0s5    6:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s6  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Beornholm              +62.5 GB    disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  B9E46FBB-B968-7BF4-4F97-13776548928A                                   Unencrypted /code/pre  diskutil info says it has no file system:  precode&lt;snip&gt;    Volume Name:              Not applicable (no file system)    Mounted:                  Yes    Mount Point:              /Users    File System:              None &lt;/snip&gt; /code/pre  I'm not sure the encryption was successful. The Finder "Encrypt" option is still there.  Can someone help me figure out how I screwed this up?  I don't really want to start from scratch, unless you have an affordable option for fast data transfer on a 2011 MBP with USB 2.0.  <comment325489> I don't understand this nesting. Well, I understand it technically but what's the purpose of displacing the /Users folder on a small partition on the **same** disk (except an admin account somewhere else), mapping it back to the main system volume and then trying to encrypt everything? <comment325533> I want to make it easier to do a fresh reinstall of the operating system on the main partition if needed without having to duplicate 850 MB of files from a backup.  I thought using a separate partition was a good way to isolate my user files.  Maybe this isn't the best way - I'm open to suggestions.
