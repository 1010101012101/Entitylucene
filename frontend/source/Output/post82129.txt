iMessage entries appearing in wrong order <body> When using iMessage my entries are not being shown in the order in which they are sent and received.  For example, instead of getting the following:  precodeSent 1     Received 1 Sent 2     Received 2 Sent 3     Received 3 /code/pre  I get the following:  precodeSent 1 Sent 2 Sent 3     Received 1     Received 2     Received 3 /code/pre  How can I make the messages appear in proper "chat" order?  <answer82142> The entries should be displayed in time stamp order.  That fact that your are not just occasionally wrong but seemingly always wrong suggests that you or the receiving end has a problem with their date and time settings.  If one of your phones is out by just a few minutes, I would expect this problem only to crop up if you are replying to each other quite quickly.  If many messages can go by before switching from sender to receiver, then there could be a wider gap.  Check out codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Date &amp; Time/code and check if you or the other phone have manually set a date or time that could be different from each other.  If you both use codeSet Automatically/code it should prevent these problems. Check your timezone also.  <comment94748> no one answers me :(((( <comment94750> You'll have to be patient, the question needs re-opening and that isn't something I can do on my own.  Once it is open, then give it time for people to answer. <comment134376> I can confirm this is still happening as of OS X 10.8.5, with messages sent from iOS 7.0.4. For example, today one conversation shows as `Sent 2, Sent 1, Received 1`. The messages were about 40 minutes apart, and with someone in the same time zone. Apple squashed Messages out-of-order bugs in [10.8.3](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5612) and [10.8.4](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5730), but apparently further bugs persist.
