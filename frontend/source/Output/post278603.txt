Cannot sign in to App Store <body> Every time I try to download an app it states that I didn't buy anything yet and I have to review my account.  I did this several times putting my info in and when hitting next it says I need to contact tech support for intunes.  Which I did and problems are not resolved   <comment350621> What did you try with Apple Support? And do you have a Mac or PC with iTunes? If so, I would try to download an app in iTunes to see if that can solve your problem
