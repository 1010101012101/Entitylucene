Automator basics <body> I have a MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra. When I try to use Automator and click on the corresponding icon, it brings me immediately to the introductions files and video. How can I break this loop and get the initial window to generate a new workflow?  <comment350124> File (in top bar) new workflow, then you can fix by clicking the Status Bar where it says the name, and clicking "preferences". Best of luck, and welcome to the site!
