How can I boot my dual-booted Mac back to OS X? <body> I have a MacBook Pro and run Windows XP on it too much however I cannot remember how I can open the MacBook Pro with OS X on instead of Windows XP. How can I boot back to OS X?  <answer127376> strongHold ⌥ on boot and select your OS X partition./strong This changes your boot partition once for that time you boot.  If you want to change it permanently, boot to OS X, open System Preferences → Startup Disk and select your OS X partition, or boot to Windows, open the Boot Camp Control Panel and select the OS X partition as the boot partition. Then, you will need to ⌥-boot to boot to Windows.  <answer127493> You have to Hold option key upon start up, two HDD will apperas, select the bootcamp disk or windows disk and you are done.  <comment149268> I also believe there is a control panel in Windows that let you choose the startup disk. <comment149269> @Édouard Indeed — forgot about that <comment149362> That control panel can be uninstalled though.
