Can you add blank space to a photo in Mac Preview? <body> I would like to add a title above or below a photo that is open in Preview.  I know how to annotate the photo that writes over the photo.  I want to add a new blank area where I can put the annotation.  <answer134716> As far as I can tell you can't do this in preview.  Searching in the Mac App Store for image editor returns quite a few apps that should let you do this.  I've done this with both Acorn and Pixelmator, but they both cost. I haven't tried any of the free apps that show up.   <answer134774> That means adjusting a bitmap canvas, which is really a full fledged photo editor kind of job, I stronghighly/strong recommend pixelmator.   Though if you don't care about image quality, one could have the text you care about in a window just above or below the picture and take a screenshot of the picture+words.   <answer199108> Here's the hack I did, maybe it will help other people:  ol liGet the size in pixels of what you want the canvas to be/li liGenerate an image of that size here: https://placehold.it/{W}x{H} (e.g. https://placehold.it/350x1136)/li liCopy the image (Control click, copy image)/li liOpen preview, press kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdN/kbd or emFile/em  emNew From Clipboard/em/li liIn the new image, select all (kbd ⌘ command/kbd + kbdA/kbd) then hit delete/li liCopy your original image(s) into your new canvas, reposition as needed/li /ol  It's a hack, but it works. If you need anything more precise, then you'll probably need a proper photo editor.  <answer220039> A simplified method that works just as well:  ol liOpen your picture in Preview./li likbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdA/kbd and then kbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdC/kbd to copy it to the clipboard./li liGo to codeTools &gt; Adjust Size.../code and enlarge the image to the overall size you want for the canvas. (I would make it bigger than you need as it is easy to crop at the end.)/li likbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdA/kbd and then kbddelete/kbd to remove the enlarged image/li likbd⌘ command/kbd + kbdV/kbd to paste back the original, smaller image onto the enlarged canvas./li liChoose codeConvert/code when asked to "Convert this document to PNG" (as you can always convert back to JPG later)./li /ol  <comment305053> If you only need to do this a few times and don't plan on editing the text in the future, you can use the good ideas suggested below, but if you have any intention of doing more complex stuff or making changes in the future, I'd suggest just using an image editor from the get go, like Sketch or Photoshop or any of the other ones out there, free or otherwise. <comment323559> delete is not working for me on Sierra <comment336421> @MathijsSegers it works fine for me on Sierra, did you press Command+A before pressing delete? <comment336471> I did, but I don't have a mac anymore can't check. <comment342367> When copying the original to the large canvas, it may appear that the original gets cut-off on the sides. If so, simply drag the copied image so that it fits inside the new dimensions.
