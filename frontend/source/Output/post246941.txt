How to Install OS X on new hard drive on a Late 2012 Mac mini <body> I have a Late 2012 Mac mini. I want to replace the hard drive with a SSD. The computer place wants to charge $99 for installing the OS on top of the $129 for installing the new SSD. The tech said I can install the OS myself. Could someone please help me on how to do it so I can save $99?  <answer246942>    ol   liStart up from OS X Internet Recovery by holding down   Option-Command-R immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac.

Installing OS X is among the easiest possible things to do. <comment304692> You can use Internet Recovery.  Just hold Cmd-R while booting your Mac and it will download the last version you had installed. <comment304696> @Allan, Internet Recovery installs the version of OS X that was shipped on the Mac, which may not be the last version one had installed. I already posted as an answer the Internet Recovery directions from Apple because I though see already replaced the drive. I misread and as such David Anderson's answer of making the OS X USB  Installer is the best way to go if one still has a functioning version of OS X installed, or can have it made on a friends Mac. Either way is better then paying $99 to have it installed. <comment304697> @user3439894.  I am fully aware of that.  However, given the age of the machine, it is quite possible that Internet recovery is available either through the original installation or through an upgrade.  Attempting IR doesn't break anything. <comment304698> One thing I forgot to mention, you can have the OS downloaded / installed for free at any [Apple Store](http://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/).  Just make an appointment, tell them that you HDD is erased and you need to install El Capitan. <comment304780> Thank you everybody for your help. Unfortunately, there is no Apple Store where I live so I have to install the OS myself and follow David Anderson's answer. :)
