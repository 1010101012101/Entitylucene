How to 'clear refresh' a page display in web browsers (aka. 'hard refresh', ie. ignoring cache)? <body> While doing web development I often need to refresh a site I'm building with the cache ignored. What are the best ways to do this?  I used to use the 'Disable cache' option in Firefox's Web Developer Toolbar. However this disables the cache globally, slowing other sites down, and has the following bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643184  I gather you can do a 'clear refresh' in PC Chrome with ctrl-F5? Is there an equivalent in Mac Chrome, or Firefox for that matter?  <answer49001> For Firefox OS X 3 options:  Force Reload Page (override cache)  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdF5/kbd  kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdR/kbd  kbdShift/kbd+Reload button  Edit:  Wikipedia has an overview about how to bypass the cache on nearly every browser imaginable.  <comment56081> +1. Just FYI: [for Safari, itâ€™s a bit different](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/46739/4408). <comment56102> Thanks both. I'll accept that assuming it works in the latest version of Firefox 11 - haven't managed to reproduce a caching issue without it to test yet!
