Persistent vertical blue line (Macbook pro 13 mid 2010) <body> Can anyone help me understand what this is? The line is persistent and i'm not sure it's because of a faulty LCD or something else. Is there a way to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HK1XB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer247895> That looks very much like a column of stuck pixels to me. Similar happened on one of my devices recently.  Only fix is to replace the screen.  <comment306044> Could also be a faulty cable or GPU, but I'd guess it's the screen.
