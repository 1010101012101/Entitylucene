Very odd problem with the "¨" character in Spotlight <body> I have a very odd problem, whenever I search for something in Spotlight, say, Safari, I often misspress "¨" instead of enter, if I then press enter again when it says "Safari¨" in spotlight, I can't delete the character with the delete arrow. Is there a solution to this problem? I mean it's a minor one but I do use Spotlight fairly often.  <comment259255> The "¨" key is not exactly standard - what keyboard do you have? BTW, when I type "¨" in Spotlight (using Option+u) I can delete it quite fine (UK keyboard). <comment259267> @Huitzilo  He is probably using a US International PC layout, where typing the quotation mark is a dead key for the umlaut over the next vowel you type. <comment259272> @Huitzilo What do you mean with "not exactly standard"? <comment259299> I know it's supposed to be used for an umlaut, but it should be able to detect if press delete. And I'm using Swedish - Pro. <comment259301> What version of OS X are you using?
