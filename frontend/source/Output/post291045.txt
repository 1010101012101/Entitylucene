What is the correct ownership for subdirectories in /usr/local <body> After a few reckless uses of codechomod/code (and some history I don't recall, apparently) I currently have the following ownership in my code/usr/local/code:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   13 Rax   admin   Caskroom/ drwxr-xr-x   87 Rax   admin   Cellar/ drwxr-xr-x    3 Rax   admin   Frameworks/ drwxr-xr-x   17 Rax   admin   Homebrew/ drwxr-xr-x    2 Rax   admin   Library/ drwxr-xr-x    6 root  wheel   MacGPG2/ drwxr-xr-x  654 Rax   admin   bin/ drwxrwxr-x   16 Rax   admin   etc/ drwxr-xr-x  118 Rax   admin   include/ drwxr-xr-x    4 Rax   admin   info/ drwxr-xr-x  438 Rax   admin   lib/ drwxr-xr-x    3 Rax   admin   libexec/ drwxr-xr-x    5 Rax   admin   man/ drwxr-xr-x    7 Rax   admin   mysql-utilities-1.5.3/ drwxr-xr-x  111 Rax   admin   opt/ drwxr-xr-x    3 root  wheel   remotedesktop/ drwxr-xr-x   42 Rax   admin   share/ drwxr-xr-x   10 Rax   admin   texlive/ drwxr-xr-x    6 Rax   admin   var/ /code/pre  Is this the correct default ownership for current (≥ 10.12.5) macOS? Should I change some of these (back) to coderoot:wheel/code?   <answer291046> Out of the box - coderoot:wheel/code has ownership of /usr/local and 0755 permissions. It's really up to you what you want. Since you clearly have homebrew or remnants of that, I'd do whatever codebrew doctor/code says you need to do for the user account you want to run things. I'd say keeping codeuser:admin/code permissions is just fine for almost all cases in that part of the directory.  I have user:admin and 0775 permissions on everything but code/usr/local/code itself and code/usr/local/remotedesktop/code which match and are coderoot:wheel/code with 0755.  <comment367473> So there's no reason to set, for example, `bin` or `etc` to `root:wheel` (and they don't come that way by default)? FWIW, `brew doctor` seems happy with what I've got. An <comment367475> @raxacoricofallapatorius Correct - You could open an installer with a tool like Pacifist and see the permissions that the vanilla installer runs or snoop on the recovery HD - https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/116612/5472 - if memory serves neither `bin` or `etc` comes out of the box so it's up to whatever process creates them to set permissions or responsible for what permissions you have. <comment367476> FWIW, looking at what's on the recovery HD (in what's mounted by `hdiutil mount /Volumes/Recovery\ HD/com.apple.recovery.boot/BaseSystem.dmg`) I see that `bin`, `lib`, `libexec`, `sbin`, `share`, and `standalone` are all present (and all that's present) and all have `Rax:staff`. <comment367477> I must admit I'm not clear with the significance of `staff` vs `admin` is here. <comment367486> @raxacoricofallapatorius If you mount a dmg you are the owner of the mounted volume and consequently **all** files are RAX:staff - even the mach_kernel! Also: /usr/local doesn't exist in there. <comment367488> @klanomath Ah, so what was bmike's point? <comment367489> I retract my point in comments about recovery. I’ve looked at the actual installer - /usr/local is the only stock directory and it’s root and wheel - the body of he answer is correct. The comments not so much.
