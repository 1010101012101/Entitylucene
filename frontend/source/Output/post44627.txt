Why does my iPhone flash when I receive a message? <body> After the recent iOS upgrade, my iPhone flashes every time I receive a text message, and I can't find a way to turn it off. I checked the setting but there are no options where I can disable it from flashing. It is very annoying.  <answer44630> This is a feature introduced with the strongiOS 5 update/strong.

This makes no sense.... <comment92103> @adolfgarlic Hey, that's a really interesting question! I never thought about that. My guess is that it's probably easier to instantly grasp where the dot it. Without the blue line you only have a whiteishgrey circle on a whiteishgrey background. You should post this as a question on http://ux.stackexchange.com. (ux - user experience). If you don't want to, I will ;) <comment92236> Also why do you have to press on the slider buttons (like the custom vib and LED flash ones) this confused the carp out of me when I first got an iphone trying to slide the darn things over...
