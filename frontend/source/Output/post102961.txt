How to upgrade Individual Developer Account to a Company Account? <body> I have an Individual Developer Account of $99 and now I want upgrade my account to a Company Account. What is the process of upgrading?  I have some running apps on the App Store with my individual account, which are showing my name under the app name.  I want it to show my company name under my app name. Is this possible after the upgrade? Can it show my company name everywhere, i.e. in iTunes Connect, Member Center etc.?  <answer103152> The best manner to accomplish this is to contact Apple Developer Program Support directly.   You can find their phone number and initiate a support ticket from this web page:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/contact//li /ul  I have found them to be expert at getting you the information you need to effect a smooth and orderly transition and help you from registering incorrectly or having any assets trapped in limbo if you make the transition incorrectly.  <answer214489> First and foremost, you must get a D-U-N-S number from D&amp;B Inc. it takes 30-45 days for normal register via D&amp;B site but you can speed up this process by register via this link, it only takes 5-7 business days. Afterwards you can search your company/organization name via Apple D-U-N-S Number Lookup site and request a D-U-N-S number for it.   Once you get the D-U-N-S number, just contact Apple via developer site to ask for convert from Individual to Company/Organization account.  <comment121164> you need to contact to apple via mail.... <comment121433> Hey thank you for your response!!! I contact to apple support. but for doing so thay want me to founder or cofounder of company but i am employee of my company that's the problam <comment121512> Have the company appoint you as legally responsible for this activity or generally responsible to enter into contracts on behalf of the company. You can be sure the founder of Nike didn't need an iTunes Connect account for them to put apps on the store.
