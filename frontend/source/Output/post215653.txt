iTunes updated my iPhone 5c to 9.1 but now iTunes on my PC wont connect to my phone <body> I have updated my iPhone 5c to iOS 9.1br When I try to connect it to my iTunes Library I get a message that the iPhone can't be used as it requires a newer version of iTunes.   iPhone and iTunes are both up to date.  I'm using Windows Vista.  <answer215654> Your version of iTunes is unlikely to be up to date [currently 12.3.1], as the latest version requires a minimum OS of Windows 7.
