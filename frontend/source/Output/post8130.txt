Can I override the error AutoCAD gives about my older video card? <body> I have a macbook 2,1 upgraded to 4GB ram and 500 GB hard drive. When installing AutoCAD, it complains that i have an older video card. Granted, that is true, I only use autocad for 2d purposes only. Is there a way to override that error?  <answer9619> Thanks to Asmus's suggestion I found that if you remove your graphic card's model from the file unspt_gfx_cards you can install AutoCad. So to recap:  ol liCopy the .mpkg package out of the DMG file to some place like your Desktop/li liRight click on the package and select 'Show Package Contents'/li liBrowse to Contents/Resources/unspt_gfx_cards/li liRight click unspt_gfx_cards and open with textedit/li liRemove all lines that contain Intel or GMA(for your macbook) and save/li liDouble click on the .mpkg to install without hardware restrictions/li /ol  Not sure if you will have any problems running Autocad but at least you should be able to install it.  <answer69002> Yes, that would work but you still won't be able to use it as it will give a WHIP error.  Solution: Buy a new i5/i7 Mac, or use BootCamp to boot into Windows XP or 7 and run from there.  <comment10020> I don´t have AutoCAD, but for some software I´ve been successful to edit the installation script inside the Installer.app to not check for certain hardware features (by editing any `is hardware supported?` routine to always return `true`. You will probably want to use  have to right-click the installer and "show package contents" and from there on, you´re basically on your own. <comment10122> Although this solves the installation problem, I still can't run autocad due to "whip" failed to initialize error <comment37712> do you know how to fix the "Whip failed to initialize" error? <comment37716> @joao No but I bought a new MBP
