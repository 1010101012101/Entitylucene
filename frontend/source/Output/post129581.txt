Recovery Partition on Mac Mini with RAID 1 <body> Earlier this week, my Mac Mini OS crapped out on me. So I decided to upgrade the memory to 16GB and purchased the dual drive kit. I am running 2x 750GB in RAID 1.  I know Internet Recovery only installs the OS that originally shipped with the Mac, or at least it seems so whenever I try (Mountain Lion). However, I want to do a clean install of Mavericks. Luckily, I created a USB installer of Mavericks. When I go to install, it says it cannot create a recovery partition due to my disks being in RAID 1.  Is there any way around this using Terminal? I also read that installing from USB drive doesn't create a recovery partition anyway and that I would have to install ML and upgrade to Mavericks from there.
