Why won't the audio switch back to my Internal Speakers after having used Apple TV? <body> When I extend my MacBook display to my TV using my Apple TV, both the video and audio work well, being output through my TV.  However, when I disconnect my Apple TV, the video disconnects, but audio from my computer is still output through my TV.  I tried going to System Preferences  Sound and toggling the output back to my Internal Speakers, but this doesn't seem to work.  Any idea why?  <answer155413> I've had this problem happen to me in the past. I have found that restarting my Mac tends to fix the problem.  Try restarting your Mac.  <answer155425> I have had something similar on the Answer when directing sound vai the say command to my Apple Tv and then back to the Built in output.  I would have to run the command to switch back twice to get it back  You could open Terminal.app  and type and run   precodesay -a 38 "I am Back" /code/pre  a couple of times.  <answer174522> Quit the coreaudio task in Activity Monitor.  <answer188097> Try to reset both your Mac and the TV, that works for me.  <answer221203> Here’s how to quickly fix the missing audio output on a Mac.
