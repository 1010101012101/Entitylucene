MacBook Late 2008 SSD Upgrade <body> I have the late 2008 edition of the unibody MacBook. It has a built-in HDD which became unbelievably slow. The other tech-specs are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TyzLX.png" alt="my tech-specs"  Now, since its not too bad regarding the processor and the memory is ok too, I thought about speeding it up a bit by giving it an SSD.  [#1] Do you think this SSD will work for the MacBook? Or do you have another recommendation?  strongEDIT/strong  [#2] I found an even quicker one for just 10$ more, might that one work as well?  <answer177289> Yep it'll be compatible, your HDD is a SATA II.   But because of the SATA2 limitation (~300MB/s) you won't be able to use your SSD at full speed.   <answer177290> Yes, that drive will work for your Macbook. However, keep in mind that your machine uses a SATA II interface. This means that the maximum throughout is 300 MB/s. Though SATA III drives, such as the one you link to, are backwards compatible, there’s no benefit to spending the extra money. You are better off finding a SATA II SSD. Either way, you will notice a drastic improvement in speed and performance.   <answer177312> I have that same model and have a 240GB SSD from OWC in it.  Have had for probably two years.  It works very well and since you just need a 3G model you can get one for like $125.00 or so.  <comment209661> Oh really? So is it 300MB/s in- or output? <comment209662> Thank you, is it 300MB/s in- or output? <comment209663> @LinusG You’re welcome. Both. You will not exceed 300 MB/S reading from it or writing to it. <comment209664> Both, it's the same thing for the controller. <comment209666> I see, thank you! <comment209667> I see, thank you! <comment209677> How do you actually know what SATA I have? In the system info it just says "SATA", same on the official Apple Website. <comment209682> How do you actually know what SATA I have?

SATA II is much older as it was released in 2004. <comment209687> @LinusG., the specs of that laptop are available in several places such as http://everymac.com. SATA III didn't appear in the Mac laptop line until the 2011 MacBook Pro (8,1). <comment209688> Also EveryMac is a good reference : http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook-core-2-duo-2.0-aluminum-13-late-2008-unibody-specs.html (3Gbps = SATA II) <comment209690> Oh ok I didn't know how to interpret the 3Gbps
