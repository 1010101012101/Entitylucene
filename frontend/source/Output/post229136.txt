Macbook 15" showing green distorted logo and wont start <body> I have macbook pro 15" (late 2011). Its showing a distorted green logo and loading bar on starting. Its taking around 10 min then showing just white screen. I tried resetting pram, but its still the same. What might be the issue ? How to fix ?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UJNrl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229179> I would say that you have a dying/dead discreet GPU, as that's a known problem with your model of MacBook Pro. Booting into safe mode may be doing something to help your GPU (I have an Xserve with a confirmed dying GPU that boots in safe mode but not without it) so it boots properly. I would emhighly/em recommend getting your MacBook Pro replaced as soon as possible via the Apple program. I would suggest you run Apple Hardware Test and verify that your GPU is dead/dying, but this may not be possible given your current state. Similarly, you can run a GPU stress test program like Unigine Heaven and see if your GPU quits.  In any case, seeing if you can get your computer replaced probably isn't a bad idea since it's pretty likely your GPU is dying. Go to an Apple store, explain the issue, and they'll probably give you a new computer.  <comment279475> ehhh, did you purchase it recently? or is this your computer you've had for a while? and when did this start? <comment279476> I am using this from 2012  it was working just fine a couple of hours ago. I put it in sleep mode and tried to wake it after an hour or so ... It didn't wake so I put the power button for 10 seconds... And this hell happened !! <comment279477> This does not provide an answer to the question.
