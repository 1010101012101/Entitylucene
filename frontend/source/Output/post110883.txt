I'm suffering from the excessive CPU use from kernel_task <body> My mac recently has gone wild with kernel_task. It slows down the computer, the fans blow wildly for around ten minutes after startup (shut down, restart or sleep). I did an EtreCheck scan and got these results and don't know what to think of them. Any help?  precode Hardware Information: MacBook Pro - model: MacBookPro9,2 1 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 CPU: 2 cores 4 GB RAM   Video Information: Intel HD Graphics 4000 - VRAM: 1024 MB  Audio Plug-ins: BluetoothAudioPlugIn: Version: 1.0 AirPlay: Version: 1.9 AppleAVBAudio: Version: 2.0.0 iSightAudio: Version: 7.7.3   Startup Items: FanControlDaemon - Path: /Library/StartupItems/FanControlDaemon   System Software: OS X 10.9 (13A603) - Uptime: 4 days 15:12:46  Disk Information: APPLE HDD HTS547550A9E384 disk0 : (500.11 GB)     EFI (disk0s1) &lt;not mounted&gt;: 209.7 MB      Macintosh HD (disk0s2) /: 499.25 GB (398.85 GB free)     Recovery HD (disk0s3) &lt;not mounted&gt;: 650 MB   MATSHITADVD-R   UJ-8A8       USB Information:    Apple Inc.

If/once you have a backup of your files then my suggestion would be to use Onyx http://www.titanium.free.fr/ for your OS to clear out some caches, logs, and day to day junk that piles up.   Getting rid of logs, caches, and Spotlight indexes can help your system repair itself.   Once Onyx has run its course and the system has rebooted wait for spotlight to rebuild and see if kernel task still is eating up your CPU. If it does then I would recommend reinstalling the OS. (That's why I like making sure you have a backup of your files before hand)  <answer118174> Fixing Excessive FONTD CPU usage in Mavericks  ol liOpen application “Font Book” in /application/utilities. /li liUnder File Menu choose “Restore Standard Fonts…” this will remove all not apple fonts.

I would run `sysdiagnose` once right after reboot when the blowers are active and then again 20 minutes later when things have calmed down. You can diff the top output and look for other differences. kernel_task is just a worker, so you'll need to find out what is asking it to do work to find the source of the behavior.
