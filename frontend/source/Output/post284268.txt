How do I validate data in Automator? <body> I'm making an app in Automator to quickly delete my iMovie Library (to save space). However, I want my app to check if the iMovie Library has already been deleted and show a dialog saying so. I know how to make the dialog, but I can't figure out how to do it. How do I do this? I'm using macOS 10.11.  My workflow:  ol liAsk for confirmation/li liGet specified Finder items (the validation would go after this)/li liMove Finder items to trash /li liRun AppleScript (to show a dialog saying "Done")/li /ol  <answer284363> You can use a Run AppleScript action to perform validation. Between actions 2 and 3 in your workflow, add a Run AppleScript action with the following:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     if input is {} then         display notification "File already deleted"         tell me to quit     end if     return input end run /code/pre  This checks if the input is empty (because the file can't be found), and if so, runs your desired code â€” you can customise codedisplay notification/code as you please, such as showing an alert. The use of codetell me to quit/code if the input is empty will stop the workflow at this point.  <comment358482> Show us the workflow and code you already have. Also what version of OS X/macOS are you running?
