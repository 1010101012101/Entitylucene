How can I "bind" two speaker outputs in OSX? (the feature is gone) <body> I used to be able to make music play out both my laptop speakers and also my monitor speakers.  I did this in the System Preferences and "creating" a new audio device that composed of both my laptop and my monitor.  However sometime later I'm unable to find or locate the setting to create a new audio device that allows for this.  How do I re-enable sound out both my laptop and monitor speakers?  The only changes I made since I did this include: Install Logix, Install (and remove) Boom audio boost, and normal system updates.  <answer96862> Try multi-output devices in code/Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup.app/code?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uVM4K.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment113656> Please rate the answer up if it meets your requirement.
