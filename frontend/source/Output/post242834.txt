App supports Wallet, now what? <body> If App Store tells you that an app supports Wallet, is there a way to know how exactly? I have an app from my car insurer and it apparently supports Apple Wallet but within the app I cannot find any Add to Wallet buttons. Is there a way for Wallet to add the app itself?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jnvUh.jpg" alt="Apple Store screenshot"  For example, App Store supports Wallet but not sure how to add it to the Wallet app.  I thought you'd be able to open Wallet and browse apps installed on your i device   <comment298851> The app might have a button that says "Add to Wallet" or "Add to Passbook".  If it doesn't have that then it doesn't support Wallet. <comment298866> @fbara the App Store clearly indicates it supports Wallet. <comment298890> I'm speaking about a button within the app itself.  For the App Store to show that 'Wallet' part, the developer just needs to check a box indicating the app supports that feature.  It's up to the developer of the app to add that functionality inside the app itself.  If you've searched inside the app for button that adds it inside the Wallet and can't find it, either the developer didn't add that function yet or it's poorly designed.  Contact the developer for guidance.
