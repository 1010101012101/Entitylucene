How can I clean Makeup Foundation off a keyboard? <body> I Refurbish / Rebuild Apple Mac  Computers for a Recycler. We get hundreds of school computers / laptops and a good portion of the keyboards have a tan colored stain which most agree is "makeup foundation".  I have tried many cleaning products as well as solvents and mild acids but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions on how to clean these Keyboards?  <comment199000> I am not sure whether it is "makeup foundation". I would argue that it is a mixture of dirt, oil, dead skin, etc. If you 've tried many products, then maybe the "stain" is absorbed from the plastic itself and is going to stay there... Anyway, I am not sure if apple.se is appropriate section for the topic. <comment199005> Thank-you for your response. I apologize if this seems inappropriate, it just seemed that this site had reference to cleaning Macs. Anyway, I agree that it could be any of those things. The schools that I have contacted said that for thew most part it is "Makeup Foundation". <comment199172> Bleach? Worth risking it on one, though it may yellow white plastic, if you're unlucky. 2 types to try, chlorine & oxygen. <comment199179> @PaulWilliams No problem. It is just that posting in a more relevant section may lead to a proper reply. I will flag the post so that it is moved accordingly
