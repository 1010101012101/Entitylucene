iTunes Sync - Manually Control <body> How do I control iTunes Sync to control exactly what I would like to upload to my iPhone or iPad?  Note: I am running iOS 5 on the phone, and iOS 6 on the iPad.  <answer74386> In iTunes go to the upper right hand corner:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R5sil.png" alt="enter image description here"  select the device (iPad or iPhone), then this window opens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GFV13.png" alt="enter image description here"  Put a check mark in the box marked with red in the photo above (Sync only checked songs and videos).  You'll be able to select what Music/Videos are checked by selecting the Music or Movies tab at the top of this picture (notice Summary is currently selected).  <comment87563> Lynda, did this answer your question?  Did you need anything else?
