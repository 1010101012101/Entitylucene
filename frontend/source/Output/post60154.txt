VMware Fusion auto-adjusting Windows 7 resolution on MacBook Pro Retina <body> Finally my company bought me a MacBook Pro Retina (yeah! I feel so lucky!)  I always used Windows (and need it, because of Visual Studio), so I installed VMware Fusion.  I installed Windows 7 as virtual machine. The problem is that whenever I launch the machine, VMWare automatically sets the resolution of the guest to the maximum available on the mac (that is 2880x1800). So I changed the resolution from Windows and set it to 1440x900, but when I restart, on the logon screen, it reverts back to 2880x1800 (automatically!). I thought it was due to the VMware Tools, so I uninstalled them. It now works correctly, however I lose a lot of features without the Tools installed. How can I solve this?  <answer60242> I dont have a real fix I guess that will require a patch from VMware. In the meantime I found this hint via Google:  Go out of full screen mode (ctrl-cmd-F) and then back again.   <answer60584> Download the VMWare Fusion 2012 technology preview, this issue is fixed in that release.  <answer72046> You can also use the following command to set the resolution:  precodeC:\Program Files\VMware Tools\VMwareResolutionSet.exe"  0 1 , 0 0 1920 1440 /code/pre  <answer103194> I am using VMWare Fusion 5.x on MAcBook Retina 13' and as a workaround, I have created a .bat file (auto executable) to automate the commands as suggested by Michiel on my Windows and I just double-click it to bring back my preferred resolution.  ResetResultion.bat file has the following content:  precode"C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Tools\VMwareResolutionSet.exe"  0 1 , 0 0 1920 1200 /code/pre  <answer104716> I'm using VMWare Fusion 5.0.3. With codevmwaretools/code installed, it's very easy to change the resolution on the Windows VM:  ul ligo to strongVirtual Machine  Settings  Display/strong/li lithere is a checkbox strongUse full resolution for Retina display/strong/li liuncheck it and the vm changes back to normal resolution./li /ul  <answer156696> Edit code~/Library/Preferences/VMware Fusion/preferences/code file by adding following lines:  precodepref.autoFitGuestToWindow = "FALSE" pref.autoFitFullScreen = "stretchGuestToHost" /code/pre  codepref.autoFitGuestToWindow = "FALSE"/code disables auto fit for Single Window mode. codepref.autoFitFullScreen = "stretchGuestToHost"/code disables auto fit for Full Screen mode.  <comment83744> I just purchased a 15" Retina MacBook Pro and had the exact same issue as you did. I'll assume that you are running VMWare 4 and the best solution I found was to upgrade to VMWare Fusion 5. This new version has explicit support for the immense resolution of the Retina screen and it solved all of the resolution related problems I had. <comment87788> I have the same problem but am using the latest version of VMWare, 5.0.2 <comment178511> Good call, this did the trick!  Thanks. <comment191643> This seems like the best answer. Worked perfectly. (Of course, make sure to restart VMWare Fusion after making these changes). <comment237068> Thanks! I created an account here just to give you a +1. That was right on spot! <comment295009> Turn on Retina option go the VM, set the resolution you like delete this resolution set exe file mentioned above  this will stop reverting back <comment304648> I am using El Captain, Windows 7 pro inside VMware fusion. Now I can set resolution and don't allow it auto-changing.
