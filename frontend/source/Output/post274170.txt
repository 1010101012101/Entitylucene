adding color to an antique photo <body> Is there any way to add color to an antique photo?  I have a faded antique picture of my grandparents when they were in the circus in the 1930s.  I would like to add a faded red color to the circus truck they're standing next to and uploaded it to ancestry.  Help.  I'm not a techy.  <comment344619> You can check automatic online tool http://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/ samples look very promising <comment344640> I vote that  this is not an apple question and should be  migrated to the photography stack exchange
