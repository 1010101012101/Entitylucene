Reminders app showing wrong day, or may be its confused between 1985 and 2085 <body> Please check attached image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVvvS.png" alt="enter image description here"  Anyone faced similar problem? any reason for odd behavior?  <answer186231> If you look at the date-entering form, you'll see that Reminders gives you space to write a 4-digit year, so it assumes the number you enter is the complete year. You didn't send it to 2085 â€“ you sent it to strong00/strong85! (And because I have no life, I actually scrolled through iOS Calendar to check. 2/1/85 was, in fact, a Thursday!)  I don't know if a solution exists. You may just have to get used to writing the full year, or just clicking the date on the dropdown calendar.  <comment219807> I typed 1985, but Reminders app converted it to 85. <comment219808> In that case, I have no idea what's going on. It's not doing that for me. Sorry!
