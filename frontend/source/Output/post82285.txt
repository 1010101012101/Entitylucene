Microsoft Outlook 2011 constantly crashing <body> I just purchased Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac last week. Outlook CONSTANTLY crashes. I have tried everythingâ€¦ uninstall and re install twice, rebuilding main identity. Please help! I am so frustrated since I just purchased this. I am running Mountain Lion as well.

I googled merp crashing outlook and came across an article on answers.microsoft.com.  From what it said, you need to update Microsoft Error Reporting Program (Merp) from Here:   http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28734.  Before you do that, check and see if you have any rules that may be corrupt and remove them.  Here's the link about Merp crashing outlook:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macoutlook/outlook-2011-crashes-every-time-i-open-rules/8740225f-9b4b-4df7-a1e1-f693fb12322f?msgId=655b76b4-28af-4df0-b5e5-56989f26677e  <answer135248> Hey I had the same issue with my computer. I wasted my time on it for many days but finally I got a solution from this link http://www.microsoftliveassist.com/cant-verify-the-signature-install-error-in-office-2013/  <comment95241> I updated MERP and also took the Office 14.2.5 Update as well. It is still crashing. Here is the error now: <comment141450> There is a bug that is throwing licence verification errors, reinstall and then update all the way to [14.2](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9d260944-0d77-4fb7-9699-f2bf00132d07) and see if that works EDIT: I see from the error that you are already @ 14.2 and change. I will edit more when i find a further answer. <comment141451> You tagged your question with Mountain Lion and mentioned Microsoft Office despite your title mentioned Outlook. OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion Gatekeeper feature may cause problems with your app. <comment160305> Links may break in the future which is why we prefer answers which summarize the essential part of the referenced site.
