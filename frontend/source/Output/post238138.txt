Is the battery in the new Macbook (the one with USB-C) replaceable? <body> It seems that the new battery is glued into the computer. Does this mean that it can't be replaced, or has Apple somehow figured out a way to remove the glue?  <answer238144> The battery in the new MacBook is replaceable but Apple recommends that you bring it to them for servicing and replacement, if necessary.  Here's what Apple says about the battery:     MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro computers with built-in batteries should only have their batteries replaced by an Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store. Attempting to replace a built-in battery yourself could damage your equipment, and such damage is not covered by warranty.      These Mac notebooks have built-in batteries:br/      ul   liMacBook (13-inch, Late 2009) and later/li   liAll MacBook Air computers/li   liAll MacBook Pro computers with Retina display/li   liMacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) and later; MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2009) and later /li   /ul
