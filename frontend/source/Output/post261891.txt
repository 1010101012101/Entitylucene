Someone how to solve this ?    <answer261967> It sounds like your machine thinks you have an ISO keyboard (which has an extra key to the left of z for grave/tilde) instead of ANSI.

After installing it, you need to look in the readme for this section:      Change section key § with accent key `   Apply the configuration and everything will work again!   <comment328017> What Keyboard are you using? US? Spanish? Portuguese? Italian? French? In macOS Sierra, if you hold down a vowel or consonant key, a small pop-up window appears with all the available diacritical and other marks available. A number appears above the selections, and typing that number inserts that character with the diacritical mark. <comment328067> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106058/difference-between-us-qwerty-and-international-qwerty-apple-keyboards
