YouTube won't play on iPhone 6s on WiFi <body> When I turn wifi off, YouTube works. Does it plays on my data plan? But with my wifi on, YouTube doesn't work. Why all of sudden am I having this problem and how do I resolve it?  <comment333768> It's helpful if you include specifics like your device, your iOS version, etc. Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment333771> Also, are there other devices connected to the same WiFi network? Can they access YouTube? <comment334078> have you checked the network access settings for YouTube app? It's [possible that you have revoked internet access via WiFi for YT. <comment335187> That's my guess too; check your router's settings. Maybe something changed where YouTube is now being blocked on your local network.
