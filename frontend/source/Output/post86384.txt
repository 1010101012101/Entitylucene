Window size of VirtualBox on mac <body> I'm trying to install Windows by using VirtualBox on mac, but the size of VirtualBox don't fit the size of my mac.  The window size is too small, how can I make it fit my computer?  By the way, I'm using Retina macbook pro.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69M7R.jpg" alt="It display below"  <answer86389> You simply need to install the "Guest Additions". See the instructions on VirtualBox web site.  Once installed, reboot the VM and you will be able to resize the "window".
