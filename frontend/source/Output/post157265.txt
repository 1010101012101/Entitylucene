Can I search for folders of a certain size (say more than xxx mb) <body> I am cleaning up a bit. I know how to search for files of a certain size (see below). Is there a way to search for folders above a certain size? Shell commands are ok, but gui is preferred.  To search for files above a certain size:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nH52x.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you don't see the "file size" option, select "other", it will be there.  then:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nz9To.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is great for files, but it does not include directories/folders. Also, please don't delete files that you do not know what they are for. Some are low level system files and can cause problems.  <answer157271> I recommend using a disk space analyzer application for this purpose, specifically because of the concerns you bring up.  Some options include DaisyDisk (Free to try, Full Version US$9.99) or  GrandPerspective (free), OmniDiskSweeper (free)  <answer157287> I would do this from a terminal window like so:  substitute whatever byte value you're interested in for where I have 100000 below  run this command from the directory you're interested in checking the subdirectory sizes of (from root / if everything)  codedu -k * | sort -nr| awk '$1&gt;100000{print}'/code  <comment184926> Thanks - I'll look into those two. In the past, I've bought some apps that are supposed to "clean-up" after deleting programs, but I found those rather unreliable. I presume these are better... Have you used either of them? <comment184930> These do a different thing - they just tell you the size of each directory and its sub directories - some e.g. OmniDiskSweeper allow you to delete (not Trash) any selected directory tree see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/5360/237 for more <comment184931> @DavidDelMonte I've used both, i prefer the way DaisyDisk shows the used space. <comment184932> @Mark Thanks for adding OmniDiskSweeper, I've also used that and it works well. But what you've said about DaisyDisk and GrandPerspective is not true. DaisyDisk has a drop location where you can collect unwanted files for deletion. GrandPerspective has a delete button on the toolbar as well. <comment184939> Thanks Levi, and welcome to Stack Exchange. Would your du command capture system/app files as well? Thanks <comment184942> Thanks all, I tried almost all of these and loved DaisyDisk. So that's my choice. I appreciate the help.
