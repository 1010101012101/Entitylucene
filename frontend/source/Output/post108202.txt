May I have a list of "System" group names, and their respective gid(s)? <body> I know there are group names such as "Staff" and "Admin", but are those the only ones? I suspect that the root user should also be assigned in a group. Using the command codedscacheutil -q user/code tells me the gid of root - 0. And if a user account is an admin, then isn't it in both "Admin" and "Staff" group(s)?  By running the command codels -la /Users/code, I get the following output:  precodeNicholass-MacBook:~ Ee$ ls -la /Users total 32 drwxr-xr-x  12 root     admin    408 Nov  3 15:11 . drwxr-xr-x@ 35 root     wheel   1258 Oct 29 20:21 .. -rw-r--r--@  1 root     admin  12292 Oct 27 09:02 .DS_Store -rw-r--r--   1 root     wheel      0 Aug 25 16:58 .localized drwxrwx---   5 root     admin    170 Nov  3 08:00 Deleted Users drwxr-xr-x+ 21 Ee       staff    714 Nov  3 08:06 Ee drwx------+ 84 root     admin   2856 Oct 26 06:49 Ee (Deleted) drwxr-xr-x+ 11 EeJ      staff    374 Nov  3 15:07 EeJ drwxr-xr-x+ 14 900      admin    476 Oct 24  2012 Ee******** (Deleted) drwxr-xr-x   3 root     admin    102 Oct 27 06:50 Old Ee (frm Snow Leopard) drwxr-xr-x+ 11 ParAcnt  staff    374 Nov  3 15:11 ParAcnt drwxrwxrwt   6 root     wheel    204 Nov  1 18:18 Shared /code/pre  <answer108209> The command codedscacheutil -q group/code will output all groups with their name, ID numbers, and list of members. Be warned, when I say it will output all the groups, I mean emall/em the groups, including built-in system ones mortals were never meant to see. I'm just saying, don't freak out there are so many groups for a single-user system.  coderoot/code as the superuser is in a group by itself and also implicitly a member of every other group. Any user account can be a member of multiple groups. On my system the only member of codestaff/code is coderoot/code; admins are all in the codeadmin/code group. codewheel/code is another group name you'll frequently see for some system files; it's a popular group name on Linux systems to assign to files so that admins can edit them without using their password in codesudo/code.  It should also be noted that Mac OS X supports access control lists that provide more granular control over file permissions than traditional Unix permissions; IIRC the code+/code in the file permissions list indicates there are such extended permissions associated with the file.  <answer240281> Alternative methods for listingcodegroups/codeand theircodegid/code:  List sorted by group name:  precodedscl . list /Groups PrimaryGroupID /code/pre  List sorted by group gid:  precodedscl . list /Groups PrimaryGroupID | tr -s ' ' | sort -n -t ' ' -k2,2 /code/pre  List groups with members:  precodedscl . list /Groups GroupMembership /code/pre  Note: neither codedscacheutil/code nor codedscl/code list members of the group codestaff/code other than coderoot/code. Use codedsmemberutil/code to confirm a member belongs to the group codestaff/code.  Example a user with uid 501:  precodedsmemberutil checkmembership -u 501 -g 20 /code/pre  <comment305866> Wow, a nice compilation of useful commands!
