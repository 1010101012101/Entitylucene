Change default ssh:// behavior <body> Currently, the protocol handler codessh:///code opens the link in a new Terminal.app window. I'd like to default it so it opens it in a new tab instead. How can I change this behavior?  Backstory: I use Alfred and a workflow to open my ssh connections. The workflow uses the codessh:///code handler to open the window.  <answer144284> If you don't mind using some command-line tomfoolery:   precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to activate' -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal" to keystroke "t" using command down' /code/pre  This is from a stack overflow question on a similar topic.  If you want you can even create a new URL handler (or replace the ssh:// one) with a shell script as described at another stack overflow question.  EDIT1: you can get command line args from osascript by using something like the following (taken from the osascript man page):  precodea.scpt: on run argv     return "hello, " &amp; item 1 of argv &amp; "." end run   % osascript a.scpt world hello, world. /code/pre  <comment169972> I'm close - I created an app from the AppleScript that opens up a new terminal tab. Using [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/) I set the ssh handler to this app. However, it doesn't then execute `ssh $PLACENAME` - it just opens the tab. So I have to pass in the params of the `ssh://` protocol to the AppleScript, I think. Got any ideas? <comment169973> Can you have another line in your script to the effect of, 'tell application...... to keystroke "echo testing" '? <comment169974> I can, but how do I get the url from the `ssh://` protocol? <comment169977> I'm pretty sure that it's avail in the argv for whatever shell you're using; so if you're using bash, try using "echo $@" (before the osascript) to see what it looks like. <comment169979> Oh, I just dropped it directly into an AppleScript app, rather than using shell. Does AppleScript have access to it somewhere? <comment170243> Yes, you can access the applescript params... see edited answer. <comment170399> Have any luck making this work?
