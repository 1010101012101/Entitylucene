"use-nvramrc?"=false when disabling safe sleep <body> this is my first question here. I suppose it belongs here to the Apple StackExchange, but I'm not entirely sure it's not actually more of a Bash question, so in case I apologize for the error.  I want to turn off the safe sleep from my Macbook Pro, i.e. the saving of all the RAM content when the system is put to sleep. I've found (http://www.macfixer.com/articles/184/) that this can  be done through these bash commands:  precodesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0 sudo nvram "use-nvramrc?"=false /code/pre  Now, the meaning of the first line is clear. For the second one I found out that it prevent the commands stored in the NVRAMRC from being executed during start-up. However it's not clear to me what is the role played by commands in NVRAMRC in the sleep process, and why is it ok to turn this commands off (are NVRAMRC commands only related to sleep mode?).   Any explanation or reading suggestion would be much appreciated!
