Is there a way to auto switch wireless networks depending on signal strength? <body> I have a Linksys dual band router. Near the back of our house (which is where our computers are mostly located) only the G network really comes through so when I'm working in the front of our house, I like to connect to the N network for the extra speed. Unfortunately we are unable to move our router. If it is possible, I would like my Mac to automatically switch networks depending on the signal strength. Is there a way to do this? Our Macs are running 10.8.  Thanks  <answer62010> Not saying this is ideal or works well. But Just to give you an idea.  You can use command line tools to write a script that checks the strength. and then changes the network as needed.  To get the strength you can use this command line code:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I |grep -i "agrCtlRSSI:" /code/pre  Look at the man pages for strong/usr/sbin/networksetup/strong for changing the setup.  As an example here is a quick applescript. It only runs once as it is only an example of use. But in your script I would do it as a LaunchAgent There is an app called lingon that simplifies the writing of LaunchAgents. LaunchAgents can startup apps, run scripts at specific times, regularly or when something happens.  I hope this helps  precodeset wifi1 to "wifissid1" set wifi2 to "wifissid2"  try     set strength to last word of (do shell script "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I |grep -i \"agrCtlRSSI:\"") as number     log strength end try set network to do shell script "/usr/sbin/networksetup -getairportnetwork en1" log network    if strength is less than 50 then        if network is not equal to "Current Wi-Fi Network: " &amp; wifi1 then          do shell script "/usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 " &amp; wifi1 &amp; " &amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp; "      end if    else      if network is not equal to "Current Wi-Fi Network: " &amp; wifi2 then          do shell script "/usr/sbin/networksetup -setairportnetwork en1 " &amp; wifi2 &amp; " &amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp; "      end if  end if /code/pre  <comment209587> At http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163118/8546 (2014-12-22): "… a script to check the RSSI value of the currently connected SSID … change to … SSID with lower RSSI … triggered by network change. …".
