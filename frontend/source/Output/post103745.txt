iPhone 5 and MacBook Air take quite a few attempts to tether <body> I used to have an iPhone 4 which, when WiFi hotspot was turned on, would connect to my Air (Lion) almost instantaneously.  I have now upgraded to an iPhone 5 (iOS 7) and the process seems to rarely work. I must turn Wifi and Hotspot off and on maybe 10 times in a row before they connect. Sometimes it wont work and at all. Other times it will randomly disconnect.  Would anyone know why this is occurring?  Thanks!  <answer105441> I fixed it by going to strongSystem Preferences/strong â†’ strongSharing/strong and checking the box for strongInternet Sharing/strong.
