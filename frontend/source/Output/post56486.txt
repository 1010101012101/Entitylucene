How can I access emails in Apple Mail programmatically? <body> I have an iMac running OS X 10.6.8 and use Apple Mail version 4.5.  I need to access specific parts of specific emails programmatically using Mathematica (others of course could do this more generally with any other programming language, I need to use Mathematica).  I need to find the specific eMails, which I can arrange to identify by either the:   ul li"From" and/or /li li"Subject" /li /ul  fields.  I then need to read either a string of numbers and characters from either the:  ul li"Subject" or /li li"Body" /li /ul  fields of the eMails.  So,   ul liCan one do this?/li liIf yes, how are emails in Apple Mail kept (flat file, database file, csv, unique format, other)?/li liWhat is the name of the above file?/li liIn what directory can I find it?/li liHow do I access the file and the relevant information in the file?/li /ul  Thanks in advance.  <answer56498> There are different paths you could take and to me it seems a bit odd to try to get the information out of the mailapplications data which has probably been saved in an encoded way. If you want to try this, you may find the data in the stronghidden/strong /Username/Library. You should be able to access it via the Terminal.  Since you're flexible in the kind of language to use, I would highly recommend using Python and then just access the mailserver via imap (or pop3) and search for the information you want that way.  http://docs.python.org/library/imaplib.html#module-imaplib  <answer56537> One can do this.  The following shows what I've found...  Individual codeApple Mail/code emails reside in a directory, typically something like the following:  precode/Users/UserName/Library/Mail/POP-myEmail@isp.com@pop.secureserver.net/INBOX.mbox/Messages /code/pre  as ".emix" files readable by any text editor.  ".emix" files have a sequential numbering by mails received by one's codeApple Mail/code itself rather than the particular mailbox, something like:  precode18373.emix 18376.emix 18378.emix /code/pre  The ".emix" files have clearly marked identifiers of their content.  An abridged ".emix" file follows::  precodeReceived: (somemailprovider ...); 16 Jul 2012 00:04:00 -0000 Received: from unknown ...; 16 Jul 2012 00:04:00 -0000 X-IronPort-Anti-Spam-Result: AuEPABVXA1DR...
