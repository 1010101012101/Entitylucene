Display cannot be turned on, after lid closed in Windows 7 <body> My laptop is a Macbook Pro Retina (mid 2014). I installed Windows 7 (x64) via Bootcamp. I've found there is a problem - after the lid is closed for a while and then opened again, the display does not turn on. However, if I then connect the Macbook to an external display, the external display does turn on. So I reckon the problem is related to the display card, it seems to output signal to an external one.  How can I solve it?  <comment316574> Can you clarify - are you saying this happens while booted in Windows 7, while booted in macOS, or does it happen regardless? <comment316587> It's booted in Windows. When in windows, if follow the steps: lid off, lid on, then the builtin display will be off. Meanwhile, if I connect an external display, the external one is on. <comment316588> What happens if you press Windows + Shift + Right Arrow keys? <comment316590> Nothing happened. When the display is off, connecting to an external display seems the only way to let me see the content in the screen. <comment316591> And what about pressing the Windows + P keys? <comment316769> Windows + P keys will call the dialog of "connect to a projector", i.e. connect to a projector only, duplicate the display, extend the display, disconnect the external display. However, none of them will activate the internal display.
