How to import Apple Mail accounts? <body> I'm copying the old Mail folder over a fresh OS install.br I Copied over code~/Library/Mail/code &amp; code~/Library/Application Support/Mail/codebr Mails and mailboxes imported all right ( even better results than using codeImport Mailboxes/code menu option )br But the accounts didn't import. Where are they stored?  <answer14799> Account data should all be in code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail.plist/code.  <answer14801> Newtron's advice is spot on. For some account types, you will find that you'll need to import the appropriate keychain entries as well.  <comment16022> yeah well I re-entered the passwords, no big deal.
