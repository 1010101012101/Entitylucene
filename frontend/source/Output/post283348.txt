How do I trust a self-signed certificate in iOS 10.3? <body> With iOS 10.3 Apple changed the mechanism for trusting a self-signed certificate. Before you simply just send the PEM file to your phone and it would install as a profile and the certificate would be trusted. Now that's no longer the case as even after installing the certificate, the cert is not trusted.  Even when I use Apple Configurator to make a profile that trusts my cert, it still doesn't behave as trusted on the system.  How do I trust a self-signed certificate in iOS 10.3?  <answer286426> I solved it on mine on iOS 10.3 I had to:  ul liDelete all profiles.  (working phones didn't show a profile anyway)/li liDelete the offending POP account/li liCreate a different POP account pointing to a different server/li liTHEN you can open the server list and delete the offending outbound server.  That deletes the "bad" certificate apparently.  No other way to get to it because when you delete the single POP acocunt you lose visibility to the bad cert./li liOnce the bad server is removed, reboot to be sure/li liRebuild the original POP account, it prompted me it was not trusted, gave me the opportunity to pick "trust"/li liDelete extra POP account to other server/li lifixed me.  No "profile" shown in settings./li /ul
