Problem downloading iPhone/iOS upgrade, iTunes complains: "You do not have enough access privileges for this operation" <body> When trying to upgrade my iPhone running iOS 4.1 to 4.2, iTunes displays the error message saying:     There was a problem downloading the software for the iPhone "[Username]'s iPhone". You do not have enough access privileges for this operation.   I kept trying the upgrade process repeatedly, but with no luck. Everything else, including app and music downloads, works fine. I'm running iTunes 10 on MacOS 10.6. What do I do?  <answer4355> I found a fix on the Apple Discussions board:  ol liGo to code~/Library//code (i.e. open your home directory, then select the codeLibrary/code folder)/li liGet Info (click codeFile/code - codeGet Info/code or type âŒ˜I)/li liIf possible, make sure the lock at the bottom right corner of the Get Info window is unlocked/li liMake sure the codeSharing &amp; Permissions:/code section is visible/li liWhere it says "Username (me)" make sure the privilege is set to codeRead &amp; Write/code/li liIn the little tool/wheel pulldown right below, select codeApply to enclosed items/code (say yes, if it asks you if you know it can't be undone)/li liTry the upgrade again/li /ol  This worked for me. Hope it helps!  <comment12126> Superb! worked a treat for me, thank you
