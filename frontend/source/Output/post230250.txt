Gray iTunes album tracks <body> I noticed that a few tracks from an album appear gray.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ezPJh.png" alt="Album"  The tracks are downloaded, I can play them if I double click them explicitly, but they don't play as part of the album. If I click the album's "play" button, they're skipped (1 gets played, then 3, then 4, etc.)  Why is this happening and how can I prevent it?  hr  emI saw a similar question, Grayed-out tracks in iTunes library, but that's not what I'm experiencing â€” for me, the songs do get downloaded and everything appears to be OK, they just get skipped when playing the album./em  <answer230252> If you view by Songs rather than Albums, you'll see they are unchecked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z4NpB.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KX9w7.png" alt="enter image description here"  iTunes will always skip unchecked songs, by default.
