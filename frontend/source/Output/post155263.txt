iMovie: select parts I want to use <body> I'm new to iMovie  I have imported the raw footage I want to edit  Here is the noob question:  strongHow do I select the parts I want to use?/strong  It seems, in older versions of iMovie, this was done simply by marking (click and drag to select) the part, and then move it down to timeline  How is it done now?  emMacbook Pro 15" retina 2012 with Yosemite/em  <answer155264> Create a new project (on top), with or without a theme. Then the timeline will be on bottom and the iMovie library on top. Now you can drag pieces in, just like before.  <comment182637> Please read my question again ;) It's not like before (before, you could easily select the right parts first). How do I select the pieces I want to use? Say I have 23 minutes of footage. I want to use 5 small parts of that. EDIT: oh.. this is your first answer... <comment182640> Does [this](http://i.imgur.com/oAvF5PB.gif) help? <comment182641> No. You use the old version of iMovie? (where click and drag to select is possible) <comment182643> Oops, you're right, I didn't notice that it hadn't updated together with Yosemite, my bad. <comment182645> damn why did they change that? that was so intuitive and perfect.. <comment182649> +1 for honest mistake :) and the last comment <comment182706> @mowgli, I just updated to the new version, and the behaviour is still the [same](http://i.imgur.com/KeO478A.gif). This is version 10.0.6. <comment182716> I believe I had a bug yesterday. Today it works with click & drag. Strange
