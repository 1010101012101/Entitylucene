Deleting app backups of iTunes from Mac <body> I have few space remained on my MacBook Air. When I check codeStorage/code and click on codeManage/code, this is what I saw: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ztsa4.png" alt="enter image description here"  iTunes is using up 6 GB of space and these are apps from my phone. And the worst part is there are some apps which are not used any more and uninstalled years ago. How can I get this space back?  iTunes version: 12.6.0.100  Computer's configuration: macOS Sierra 10.12.4 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5URwk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer282356> Navigate to your iTunes library location using Finder (by default it is in code~/Music/iTunes/code), then open the codeiTunes Media/Mobile Applications/code folder and delete the apps you wish.  <comment355620> I have found "Mobile Applications" in "~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media" <comment355621> @Nuri Apologies for the mistake and thanks for the clarification.
