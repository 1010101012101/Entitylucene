Removing .ds_store from desktop while still having view hidden files on? <body> I have a .DS_Store on my desktop. Ruins the flow. I want to remove it and have it hidden, but I have hidden files enabled on my mac as I need it. This file however, is annoying.  <answer127641> You can toggle the visibility of hidden files using a keyboard shortcut from a Finder plugin called TotalFinder. Probably not worth the effort of installing it though; I donâ€™t.  <answer240546> There is a thorough discussion on this Superuser question.    Having a transparent icon that is off the desktop (Kevin Suttle), or a read-only desktop (joshfindit) seem to be the best feasible solutions.
