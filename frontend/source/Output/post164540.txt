Macbook Pro formatted with windows, now can't install OS X or Windows! <body> I formatted my MacBook Pro Mid 2010 with Windows, now I can't install any operating systems on it.  I tried to install Windows 8.1 on my MacBook, then at the final step I received a message saying that an error occurred and the installation failed.  Now, when I try to enter the Boot Menu the only option that I have is "EFI Boot", so I can't boot anything from my USB or DVD. I don't have them in my Boot Menu at all.  I tried ⌘R‏, but after the download and when I enter the installation it says "The drive is locked.".  Now all I have is a formatted Mac without any Operating Systems or any options to boot anything so that I can install a new OS. I don't know that to do?!  P.S: I didn't use Boot Camp or any other software, just used a Windows bootable device and wen ahead like windows based laptops.  <comment192924> How you tried to install Windows 8.1 ? From a USB or DVD? <comment192925> @iEngineer I used a DVD <comment192926> Then Try a DVD with Mac OS or a bootable USB with Mac OS. You will find `Disk Utility` option before the installation process. There you can format or recreate new partitions. <comment192927> @iEngineer The problem is I can't boot anything from my DVD or USB. I don't have them in my "Boot Menu"! <comment192942> They will only show if an actual bootable key/disk is in the drive. You've also, incidentally, discovered the hard way that you can't just install Windows on a Mac without Bootcamp. <comment192947> Try pressing "c"  on bootup to force start from CD /dvd
