Restore missing Ringtones, iOS 8 <body> How do I recover and set my ringtone to the lollipop guild, a song I had already purchased?  <answer161951> Make sure your phone is updated to iOS 8.1.2 - this was a known issue in 8.1.1  As you update you will get a notice about it &amp; a link to follow to get your ringtones back.  See Restore missing tones on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 8.1.1  <comment189218> I changed the title to make it easier for others to Google.
