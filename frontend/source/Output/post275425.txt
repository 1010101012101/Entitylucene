Calendar events not being generated in caldav directories <body> I have a utility which looks in code~/Library/Calndars//code for calendar events. I am having a problem that events that I can see within the Calendar application are not code*.ics/code files in the directory code~/Library/Calendars/XXX.caldav/YYY.calendar/Events//code.  I don't understand where these events could be stored, or are they being mirrored somehow and not being saved in the Events directory? Or is there a way to force downloading of the code*.ics/code files into the Events directories?
