Non-extractable private key in Keychain Access.app <body> The manual page for code/usr/bin/security/code on OS X 10.9 indicates that there is a code-x/code option for codesecurity import/code to specify that codeprivate keys are non-extractable after being imported/code.  How is this implemented?  Are the private keys imported through such means really become completely non-extractable, or is there still a way to get a hold of them through some kind of memory dump?  How do applications still use such keys for their crypto?  hr  I've tried using https://github.com/torsten/keychain_access, with the following patch,  precode-    fprintf(stderr, "Export error: %ld\n", status); +    fprintf(stderr, "Export error: %ld: %s\n", status, CFStringGetCStringPtr(SecCopyErrorMessageString(status, NULL), kCFStringEncodingUTF8)); /code/pre  but I'm getting the following error when trying to export the private key,   precodeExport error: 4294941980: The contents of this item cannot be retrieved. /code/pre  Is there some other way to get a hold of the non-extractable key?
