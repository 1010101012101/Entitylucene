How to change spelling library in Mac OS X with a shortcut? <body> Since I'm a Hungarian, but I learn and work in English, I switch the spelling settings in System Preferences approximately 50 times a day, because I'm constantly working with both languages.  Is there any fast way to change the spelling without opening the System Preferences every single time with a shortcut?  <answer186740> You can set the Language spelling to look for spelling in multiple languages.  My example is English and Spanish.  In the strongKeyboard/strong System preferences go to the strongText/strong tab.  Set the Spelling dropdown to: strongAutomatic by Language/strong  Then opening the strongSpelling dropdown/strong go down to strongSet Up…/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6QEiQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Drag your two (or more) preferred Languages to the top. And then hit the strongDone/strong button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iItyN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thats it.  Spelling will now recognise the language you are working in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cd7zi.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3eaVM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220260> It might be more helpful if you'd be more explicit and specific about exactly what changes you're making as there may be a way to script it in bash, AppleScript or Automator.  Also what version of OS X are you running? <comment220276> You could switch between 2 users... <comment220277> Don't you use the Multilingual option in the spell check dialog (Edit » Spelling » Show Spelling & Grammar) ? <comment220341> You could make a new service in Automator, make it run an applescript and then going to System Preferences and assigning a shortcut to the Automator service. I am unfortunately on my iPad, so I will provide instructions later on in the day <comment220498> @TheBro21: it would be nice to see that <comment220685> I don't think Automatic works with 3rd party dictionaries like Hungarian. <comment220688> Thanks for pointing that out. I did not realise it was third party. Should have as  I could not find it on mine. Not sure if it is expected to work with them but this is how you setup spelling for multiple languages..
