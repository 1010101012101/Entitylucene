Upgrade MacBook Pro Mid 2012 stuck on grey Apple Logo <body> I wanted to upgrade my MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with a clean Mac OS X Snow Leopard install.  I bought 2x8GB RAM and a Samsung SSD (500GB) and replaced the RAM and SSD. I put the orginal DVD in the drive and I held the kbdoption/kbd key (also tried kbdC/kbd key), but now I only see a grey Apple Logo, no loading image whatsoever.   What should I do, and should I even wait if the loader isn't shown?  strongEdit 1/strong  I tried kbdCommand/kbdkbdS/kbd. Seems to hang on Loading: codeSystem\Library\Caches\com.apple.kext.caches\Startup\Extensions.mkext/code  strongEdit 2/strong  Commmand + R almost working but i am stuck at select a drive for OS X mountain lion. My new SSD drive doesn't show up. (Do i need the samsung install drive?  strongEdit 3/strong  I am now stuck with partitioning the samsung SSD, every thing i tried gives an error message "partitionin fails" any ideas???  strongEdit 4/strong I partition with a special case with another macbook, but when i select the hd i get an error message saying something went wrong. I also looked at the install log file and what i see is: nssoftlinking the librarian framework's library couldn't be loaded from (null) and LBCurrentProcessHasUbiquityContainer can't be found......  strongEdit 5/strong ARRGGGHHH  strongedit6/strong Trying to install yosemite on ssd via USB, but it freezes with just one second to go, guess the restart doesn't like the fact there is no harddrive? Can i make this work?  <comment238804> Try booting with Command-S and Command-R and see if it boots. Also try Command-V <comment238807> Command-S seems to hang on Loading System\Library\Caches\com.apple.kext.caches\Startup\Extensions.mkext.....................  Should i try Command-R now <comment238808> Ok. Please edit it into the question rather than posting it in comments <comment238859> That machine cannot use Snow Leopard. 10.7.3 was the first OS it supported - http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i5-2.5-13-mid-2012-unibody-usb3-specs.html When you're trying to partition the SSD, are you using GUID/Mac Extended journalled? <comment240163> i am using command+r online and now it wants to install Mountain lion but see my edit 4
