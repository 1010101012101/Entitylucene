How to Remove iPhone Backup Password? <body> Before you fire up your blowtorch to flame me, please understand that I've already spent about 8 hours reading posts on Ask Different, Apple support forums, and elsewhere trying to find an answer.  There are a million suggestions, but none of them has worked.  I have an iPhone 5 running iOS 7.1.2, and I use iTunes 11.4 (18) on MacOS 10.9.4.  My iPhone backups are encrypted.  I'm usually good about remembering passwords, but for some reason, I don't recall the one I used the encrypt backups.  I'm about to sell my phone and it's worth more unlocked (which AT&amp;T has authorized).  But to finish the unlock process, I have to backup and restore.  To restore, I have to provide the password I don't have.  (I've tried all sorts of permutations of every Apple-related password I've ever used, to no avail.)  I'm fine with blowing away all my backups, both locally and on iCloud, if I can then re-create one after removing the encryption setting.  Surely there must be a way to do this, but I can't find anything on Apple's site or elsewhere.  Has anyone found a true solution to this problem?    <comment171113> is it in your keychain ? <comment171202> Nope, not in my keychain.  That was the first thing I checked. <comment171203> usually the restore from password is your apple id. <comment171311> @Buscar - Yes, usually it is.  But as I mentioned, I've spent 8+ hours scouring posts all over the web.  That's always the first suggestion and I tried it (plus all previous versions of my Apple ID password).
