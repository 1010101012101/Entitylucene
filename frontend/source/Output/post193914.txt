Get part of result of command line in OS X <body> I would like to use the following command line to get the current Wi-Fi channel.   precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I /code/pre  I would like to use exactly this command, because it's possible that I'm using more parts of the result. So I'm needing an AppleScript that returns me only the current Wi-Fi channel of the command.  I'm thankful for any help. :)  <answer193917> I would recommend using the "grep" and "awk" commands from bash.  You can use them to parse the data given in bash.  Here is example using the details you described above.  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep "channel" | awk '{print $2}' /code/pre  Do yourself a favor and sym link the binary to /usr/local/bin so you can just type airport (or script it)  precodeairport -I | grep "channel" | awk '{print $2}' /code/pre  <answer193921> Here is an example In AppleScript using tron_jones's answer.  The result of the command is set to code_channel/code and then used in a dialog box just to show the result.  Obviously code_channel/code can be used in a variety of ways.  precodeset _channel to do shell script "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -I | grep 'channel:' | awk '{print $2}'" display dialog "Wi-Fi is using Channel: " &amp; _channel /code/pre  Note: The fully qualified pathname for codegrep/code and or codeawk/code may need to be supplied.  Also the double-quotes around codegrep "channel:"/code were replaced with single-quotes so the command could be incapsulated in double-quotes in order to compile due to the single-quotes in the codeawk/code command.  By the way, the command can be reduced to the following using asterisks (code*/code) to shorten the written path to the codeairport/code command:  precodeset _channel to do shell script "/S*/L*/P*/A*/V*/C*/R*/airport -I | grep 'channel:' | awk '{print $2}'" /code/pre  To shorten the command line further, thanks to bmike, in a Terminal use the following command to create the symlink:  precodesudo ln -s "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport" "/usr/local/bin/airport" /code/pre  Then, as an example in Terminal, all you need to do is type: codeairport -I/code  Or in an AppleScript command using the previous example:  precodeset _channel to do shell script "airport -I | grep 'channel:' | awk '{print $2}'" /code/pre  <comment231229> For what is the `$2`? <comment231232> It is the second field of the input record to `awk`.  `.../airport -I | grep "channel:"` outputs `channel: 11` and pipes it to `awk` and it prints "`11`" as it's `$2`.  If you said  `awk '{print $1}'` the result would have been "`channel:`". <comment231235> Thank you for your extensively reply. It works and was/is very helpful. :) <comment231236> Maybe you can help me in this also: How can I create from the full result a list in AppleScript? With `as list`  I'm getting an error. I think the problem is that there are no commas before a return. <comment231237> @user121028 One question per question - also asking a new one in comments is considered very poor form. It makes one look a little bit like a "help vampire" although you're not showing any signs of that malady other than asking it in comments. <comment231238> Where can I change to `/user/local/bin`? With a new Terminal window it doesn't work. <comment231240> @user121028, In a Terminal, use the following command to create the symlink: `sudo ln -s "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport" "/usr/local/bin/airport"` Then, as an  example, all you need to do is type: `airport -I` <comment248158> Why would you use `grep` and `awk`?  `airport -I | awk '/channel/{print $2}'`
