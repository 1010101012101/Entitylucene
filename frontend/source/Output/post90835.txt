How to search PDFs and extract matching pages with Automator? <body> I am trying to make an Automator workflow that will alllow me to:  ol liSpecify a folder to run the actions on /li liSearch all PDF files in that folder for a certain word (my client's name) /li liCreate a new PDF file with just those pages on which my client's name appears/li liSave that file on the desktop/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLUVN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Thus far, I can do steps 1 and 2. But is there any way to see what pages the matches were on or to create a new PDF for the matching pages?  <answer124758> I realise this is a year after you asked the question but I liked the challenge. So, in summary this is how I would accomplish this...  ul liFor every PDF in folder, convert it to Text./li liUse a perl command to search the text files for keyword and return the page number(s)./li liUse command line tool to extract page(s) from PDF./li liMerge extracted pages./li /ul  You can do the first part easily enough with applescript/automator.   The perl command to get the page numbers is:  codeperl -ne 'print "$1$2" if /blah/ .. /--- Page (\d+) ---(\n)/'/code   The command tool to use to extract pages from PDF file can be found at users.skynet.be/tools/   Finally to merge the single pages can be done with automator or the above tools as well.  Hope this helps.
