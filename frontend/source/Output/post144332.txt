Can Parallels use NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M indirectly? <body> I'd like to run windows 7 via Parallels using a new 15-inch MacBook Pros with Retina display. Now, I am considering spending extra on the model with a dedicated graphics card: (strongNVIDIA GeForce GT 750M/strong )  From what I have read, Parallels cannot use the NVIDA directly (unlike Bootcamp), but I'm not clear if it can use it indirectly, and if so, in what way?  In other works, if I am running a windows software in Parallels that is visualizing large 3D data sets, how much of a difference could I expect the NVIDIA model macbook to produce in comparison to the other 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display but no graphics card?
