Why haven't I been paid yet for In-App purchases made on my app? <body> I have an app with one In-App Purchase item. When looking at the emPayments and Financial Reports/em the emEstimated Amount Owed/em is  300 DKK (I'm from Denmark).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gGfzK.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, there's been no payment yet. strongWhat am I missing?/strong  I checked in emAgreements, Tax, and Banking/em and I have a emPaid Application/em contract in place with Bank Info.  <comment365075> I believe Apple tallies everything up at the end of each month, and then sends it to you about 30 days after that. So I wouldn't expect money from a July 6th in-app purchase until the end of August at the earliest. <comment365220> When reading https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/books/faq/Payments%20and%20Financial%20Reports_Getting%20Paid# I should get payed when I have $10 - and that happened long time ago (more that half a year ago).
