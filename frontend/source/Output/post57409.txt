ifconfig - get IPs of connected USB devices <body> In Ubuntu, ifconfig lists all the USB devices with the header "usb0, usb1, ..etc"  I need to know the IP addresses of all the connected USB devices. It would be really helpful if on Mac it displayed the same thing...but it doesn't.  Is there any way to get this information? (doesn't have to be ifconfig, but needs to be some sort of terminal command)  Thanks  <comment65943> USB devices don't have IP addresses <comment65951> Phones do. It allows you to connect to them from the computer (via ssh) <comment65972> Ah, that's something completely different then. You want to find out the IP address of network-enabled devices which are connected by USB? <comment65979> Yes, sorry that's what I meant by USB device :-) <comment65985> I was thinking more of keyboards, mice, external drives etc. But back to your question: Wouldn't this require some kind of support on the USB device side of things? There is no generic way to determine a) whether an USB connected device does have an IP and b) the IP address itself. <comment65987> ifconfig lists the ips of the devices, but there's no way of knowing in the list of ips which is from a device and which isn't. Somehow Ubuntu knows which is from a usb and which isn't, so I thought it must be possible on mac. Hence my question.
