Find Contacts by address type <body> I just mass-added and edited about 500 contacts from my archives, and I would like to set the address type for some of them from codeother/code to codehome/code.  I'd like to search by address type for all contacts with an address type of codeother/code.  Ideas so far: AppleScript, Smart Group  These could work, I just don't know how to do it at the moment :)  Thank you in advance.
