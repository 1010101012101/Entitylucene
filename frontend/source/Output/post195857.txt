Is there a way possible to make iPad sleep / wake at specific time intervals using Apple configurator? <body> I would need to control an iPad's sleep/wake at specific time intervals.  I know using Apple configurator helps disabling all hardware buttons and touch events too... But my motive is to make the iPad wake by 7am and sleep by 10pm.  I know apps like MokiTouch and KioskPro helps, but has limitations. Is there a way to achieve this via Apple Configurator ?  <answer196014> i do not think it is possible to control an ipads sleep wake interval
