iTerm2 wrong color output <body> The command codels/code when using iTerm is behaving strange. It outputs colors but they change at some point and I don't think this is the normal behavior. I have the following alias for ls codealias ls='ls -FGlh'/code. I'm also using the solarized-dark profile from here. The result is as shown in the figure.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rBKP2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment170732> almost looks like an issue with escape sequences maybe? Does iTerm2 support traditional POSIX escape sequences? Seems like a dumb question, but there might be a compatibility option somewhere. <comment170733> I have no idea about that, I checked in the preferences and there's nothing related to POSIX. Any ideas on how I can check? <comment170734> try this `echo -e "\033[1;32mHEYO\033[m HI"` and see what appears, should be one colored HEYO with an uncolored hi next to it (that's what works on a little linux system, it should work on OSX though too) <comment170736> Yes, [I get that](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2346283/test.png). <comment170739> I think your LS_COLORS might be funky, because the ls pic from above looks like ls forgot to end it's output with an end sequence. I don't use iterm2, but you can try to look up setting your LS_COLORS variables on OSX using dircolors. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. <comment170742> @alexhairyman thanks a lot. I'll try to play with that variable later. <comment170827> I removed the definition of `LSCOLORS` from the `.bashrc` file and the problem persists... =/
