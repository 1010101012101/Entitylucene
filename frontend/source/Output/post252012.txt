mds_stores prevents me from ejecting Time Machine disk <body> I know many people have complained about being unable to eject a Time Machine disk.  The usual response I have found online is to download and use "What's Keeping Me?" to find out what process is accessing the disk. Well, I have done that, and it turns out the culprit is mds_stores -- in other words, Spotlight.  Now Spotlight emshouldn't/em be indexing my Time Machine volume -- I have it excluded in the Spotlight privacy pane.  Killing the mds_stores process allows me to safely eject the TM disk, so in a sense my problem is "solved".  But why is this happening?  <comment313455> Is it happening every time? <comment313484> @IronCraftMan No, but often enough that it's getting really irritating. <comment313493> have you tried restating your Mac in safe mode and seeing if it works?
