Keyboard shortcut to unhide or unminimize a window in OS X <body> I am asking this question because I feel it belongs on apple, not superuser. Also the perfect answer is not checked off there.  You hide a window using kbd⌘ + M/kbd. However even kbd⌘ + ⇥/kbd to that window does not help as the window is minimized. How do you unminimize?  <answer26183> When you kbd⌘ + ⇥/kbd to that application, hold the kbd⌥/kbd key before releasing kbd⌘/kbd. This will emreopen/em the application, typically bringing up a minimized window if there are no other windows up.  An alternative is to minimize using kbd⌘ + H/kbd which hides the window, but does not actually minimize it, therefore you can still kbd⌘ + ⇥/kbd to it without any special action.  <answer26188> A very quick keyboard method to un-minimize a specific window or un-minimize all of an app's minimized windows is this:  kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdTab ⇥/kbd to the app with minimized windows, but don't release the kbdCommand ⌘/kbd key.  While still holding kbdCommand ⌘/kbd down, tap kbdDown ↓/kbd twice, first tap enters App Exposé, second tap takes you to the minimized windows,  To un-minimize emall/em windows, press kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdReturn ↩/kbd  To un-minimize a specific window navigate to the window you want with the arrow keys, then press kbdReturn ↩/kbd  <comment29883> As a side note, I wish I could get the original answer a few hundred up votes. This is knowledge that apparently NOBODY has. People built scripts in that answer to get it working, yet there already exists a keyboard shortcut nobody is aware of. <comment29889> The Option-key trick will only work if all of an app's windows are minimized, and then it will only un-minimize one of the windows. <comment29914> +1 - So awesome to know. Can't believe I've just learned it today. <comment29939> The correct way to go about this would have been to have a mod migrate the question. <comment29987> That is very handy. Thank you. <comment30050> Nice. Lets keep this up. Good to know all the different ways to do this. <comment30089> @Dmitriy: indeed, shortcut implementation on OSX is very inconsistent/unclear <comment353928> You can also ⌘+Tab, keep holding ⌘, release tab, press option, release ⌘
