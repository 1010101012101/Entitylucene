DuckDuckGo settings in iPhone & iPad <body> I have DuckDuckGo installed as my default search engine in Safari on both my iPhone 6 and iPad mini 2 (both iOS 9.1). I also have it installed on my PC, but on my PC I'm able to customise the settings whereas on my Apple devices the customisations don't save and apply.  For example, if I use my device to click on the codeburger icon in DuckDuckGo search results &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Advertisements/code, and change from codeON/code to codeOFF/code, then click codeSave and Exit/code, the settings don't save and the search results still display ads. Is this a known bug, and if so, is there a solution for it?  <answer217997> On your iPhone and iPad, Go into strongSettings/strong → strongSafari/strong → strongBlock Cookies/strong, and choose an option other than codeAlways Block/code. Your settings should then save.  You could also enable codeCloud Save/code to sync your settings across your browsers and devices. The option is available through the same hamburger menu under strongSettings/strong, and is not associated with a username or a personally-identifiable value.  <comment263363> Do you have cookies disabled in Safari for iOS? The settings save just fine for me. <comment263424> That solved it, thank you very much @Phong :) :) <comment263748> I would certainly appreciate an accept of my response, if you don’t mind :) <comment263770> my apologies, sure thing :)
