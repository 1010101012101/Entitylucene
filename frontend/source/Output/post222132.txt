How to change the Mail “Archive” folder for email accounts in El Capitan <body> I have set the Apple Mail "Archive" folder to something custom in the past with the help of this question.  However, the  folder that I was previously using is "stuck" as the Archive folder, and my efforts to set them to a new year (I use Archive/{year}) make no difference.  In El Capitan (10.11) it seems that they've changed how settings are stored so my changes to the code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist/code appear to be being ignored.  I've had a good dig around the new(?) code~/Library/Mail/V3//code and resulting code~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData//code folders, to no avail.  Unfortunately I'm poking around blindly, so I hoped that somebody here might help.  <answer222601> Under strongOS X El Capitan/strong (tested with Mail 9.2), you can set it directly within the Mail application:  ol liSelect your emnew/em archive folder./li liFrom the menu, choose strongMailbox  Use This Mailbox As  Archive Mailbox/strong/li /ol  In German, it is strongPostfach  Dieses Postfach verwenden als  Postfach "Archiv"/strong.  Edit: Apparently at Apple they realized, that the menu location in El Capitan wasn't ideal and so they changed it again.  Under strongmacOS Sierra/strong (tested with Mail 10.1), you can still set it directly within the Mail application:  ol liFrom the menu, choose strongMail  Preferences  Accounts  emSelect your account on the left/em  Mailbox Behavior/strong/li /ol  In German, it is strongMail  Einstellungen  Accounts  emLinks den betreffenden Account auswählen/em  Postfach-Verhalten/strong.  <comment269436> I stumbled upon the same issue.
