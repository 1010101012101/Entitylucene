No more notification for iMessage with Mavericks <body> I did the upgrade to Mavericks few days ago. I noticed a problem with my iMessage app : I don't get any notification when I received a new message (neither alert, nor badges on the icon in the Dock).   How can I troubleshoot if this is a problem with my computer or account or perhaps my network connection?  <answer108189> Go to System Preferences  Notifications.  ol liMake sure that you're not in the 'Do not disturb" mode./li liCheck your settings for the Messages app. Enable 'Banners' if they're off (or even 'Alerts')./li /ol  <comment130353> Have you tried logging out off iMessage and logging back in? <comment157768> Sorry for delay ; it seems it was a Mavericks-linked problem : upgrading solved that. Thanks for helping ;)
