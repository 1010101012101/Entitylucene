Are bluetooth and wifi required for location based reminders? <body> To get location based reminders to work, are bluetooth and wifi required to be enabled or just bluetooth?   <answer240210> No, just Location Services has to be turned on with Reminders having access to Location Services.  My geo-fenced Reminders work fine without WiFi nor Bluetooth (BT) turned on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEHsE.jpg" alt="Location Services, Reminders"  <answer240212> For location-based reminders, you strongonly/strong need to have the GPS turned on.  Keeping wifi on helps with locations because it allows the device to pin-point where you're located.  Wifi is not required, however.  Bluetooth is not required for location reminders strongunless/strong you're using emiBeacons/em.  If you're using emiBeacons/em then bluetooth is required.    <comment295149> If I disable Bluetooth and/or wifi, my geofence based reminder will not work // cc @sun <comment295150> Geofence-based reminders don't require bluetooth, only GPS.  Allowing *Reminders* to use wifi, also, will improve accuracy.  This is just what I said in my answer. <comment295254> I understand your intiial answer. It just _seems_ that location based Reminders don't work at all without Wifi enabled, meaning that it doesn't fire or is completely inaccurate <comment367662> Something else to check if folks arenâ€™t seeing location-based reminders: Settings  Privacy  Location Services  System Services (bottom)  Location-Based Alerts needs to be on.
