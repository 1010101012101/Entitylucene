How to install new font on OS X? <body> How to install new font on OS X to be used across OpenOffice, iWork, OfficeForMac, mail and other word processing applications?  <answer56296> You can use the application codeFont Book/code which is part of your default OS install in your applications folder.  Open is up, hit the menus, and check out codeFile &gt; Add Fonts/code then navigate to the files in question.  <answer56297> Using Finder, drag the font files to folder code/Library/Fonts/code. Or drag the font files to folder code/Users/&lt;your user name&gt;/Library/Fonts/code when you would like to install the fonts for usage in your own account only.  <answer56299> A third option would be to open the files (for all typefaces), and click the Install Font button in the window, which copies the font files to code~/Library/Fonts//code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b029l.png" alt=""  I usually just move the files manually because I keep each font in their own folder.  <comment64593> 1. Download the font 2. Double-click the file 3. Click install 4. Restart any applications that need to use the new font. <comment64596> @gentmatt You don't even need to reopen most applications. <comment64597> @LauriRanta I'm not sure to which applications this applies (Office '08 ?), but I mentioned this just as precaution.
