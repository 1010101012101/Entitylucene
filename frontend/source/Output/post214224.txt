Natural scrolling enables / disables unexpectedly <body> I'm using "natural scrolling" by default. Sometimes when scrolling I suddenly realize that OSX has unexpectedly changed the scrolling behavior of my trackpad. If I check the system preferences I see that the scrolling behavior is still "natural scrolling" - but actually it isn't.  Even writing codedefaults read ~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist com.apple.swipescrolldirection/code on the Terminal returns a code1/code.  I usually then do the following: Unticking "natural scrolling" which then actually causes the desired "natural scrolling" behaviour - even if it shouldn't. At some point OSX (after some days) will change again its scrolling behaviour and then I just tick the box again.  Is there a way to fix this? Are the global preferences cached somewhere?  Some additional comments:  I noticed that this happens very often together with a wakeup of the computer from sleep mode. Maybe it may also have to do with plugging and unplugging my desktop mouse when in sleep mode. Restarting the computer is also not really an option for me because I usually have lots of windows open that I don't want to close and open again.
