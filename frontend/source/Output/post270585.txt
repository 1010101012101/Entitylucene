Cannot Run Sudo After Mac Sierra Upgrade <body> I tried running codesudo/code in a terminal and was greeted with the error message:  codesudo: unknown uid 501: who are you?/code  I tried doing an codels -l ~/code, and instead of seeing my user name in the file entries, I saw code501/code.  I emthink/em this might have happened in the process of upgrading Mac OS to Sierra; at least I think this is the first time I tried to run codesudo/code since upgrading.  <answer270586> The problem was fixed by restarting the MacBook Pro.  However, when I first executed the restart, the system hung with a black screen. I then forced the power off (by keeping pressed the power button for several seconds), then turned it on.  Then it worked.
