Rename when copying from case-sensitive to case-insensitive <body> I have a netatalk AFP share on a case-sensitive Linux system, which contains two files whose names differ only in case, codetest/a.txt/code and codetest/A.txt/code. Copying the folder containing these files in Finder to my case-insensitive drive only gives an error     The operation can’t be completed because an item with the name “A.txt”   already exists.   Is there a way to have Finder automatically rename the conflicting files? Or is there maybe a built-in command line tool with such an option?  I could do it manually in a shell script like below, but I'm sure there must be an easier way on a system that supports both case styles.  precodefind $1 -type f -print | while read s ; do     t="$2/$s"     while [ -e $t ] ; do t="$t.dup" ; done     cp -v "$s" "$t" done /code/pre  <answer113240> Try using codersync -b/code or codegcp -b/code. Both add a tilde to the end of the filename if a file with the same name exists in the target.
