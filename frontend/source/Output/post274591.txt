Don't repeatedly reconnect to bluetooth headphones when weak signal(at threshold) <body> I use bluetooth headphones 'Bluedio' with MacBook Pro Retina 2013 Late and Android Phone. They connected at the same time. Problem is that when I play something from Phone and move away from Macbook at distance(where my kitchen is unfortunately) exactly such that headphones begin to lost connection with Macbook, Macbook repeatedly keep trying to reconnect, silencing audio from Phone.  In my situation only way to use headphones from that location is to manually disconnect from macbook.    ul liCan I tweak signal threshold at which Macbook would not try to reconnect?/li liLower or increase bluetooth signal(in software)?/li liAny other way to help me fix issue?/li /ul
