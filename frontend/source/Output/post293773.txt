Spotlight search stopped suggesting my frequently-used app <body> I use Spotlight Search frequently to launch apps on my Mac, and it works perfectly. I use Telegram Desktop frequently by typing a few letters in Spotlight Search. I just type a few letters and tap enter and it opens. Simple as that.  However, today it started not finding it. Instead, it shows this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klCnC.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The app is there, launches perfectly manually from Applications folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kHRmQ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But in Spotlight Search, it's not being suggested. I've got Applications option ticked in Spotlight options from System Preferences (though I haven't touched it anyway) and it suggests other apps from the Applications folder with no problem. I am on macOS 10.12.6.  How can I fix this problem?  <answer294950> the same thing happened to me today... I just shut down my Mac and restarted it after a while and for now it's fixed...  I hope it will stay this way, nd it might be a solution for you as well!
