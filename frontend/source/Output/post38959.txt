Why won't my iPhone reply to a text message after updating to iOS 5? <body> After updating to iOS 5, I cannot reply to a text message from non iPhone users. iMessage works fine. In order to actually reply to a text, I have to go into my contacts and hit "Send Message"...and it will work. I've also found that sometimes, if I hit reply immediately after receiving a text, it might go through. Otherwise, it just times out. It is driving me crazy, any help is appreciated.  <answer43343> This could be the result of being in an area with poor reception but good wifi. It could also be a problem with your SIM card or phone. Try taking your phone to your carrier and describe the problem and see if they can check your phone or SIM card for problems. If that doesn't work try taking your phone into Apple to see if they can find anything wrong with it.
