terminal app minicom writing a dot '.' when sending delete key <body> What is the correct way to configure minicom so that it wouldn't just print a dot in the console when trying to erase a character ? The actual input is correctly shortened, but in the console I will see annoying dot.. So, if in terminal I press keys codea/code and codedelete/code, I will end up with:  precode&gt; a. /code/pre  But actually if I press enter now, its same as pressing just enter in empty input.  The terminal settings are:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EMrRs.png" alt="terminal settings"  If I try to change the "Backspace key sends" to another value (codeBS/code), the delete won't do anything (not clear the input but not print anything either). Thank you for any suggestions.  <comment327464> Is your issue limited to minicom? <comment327468> @ShubhamoyChakrabarty, as opposed to some other terminal emulator ?
