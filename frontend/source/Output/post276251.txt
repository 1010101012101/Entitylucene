Run untrusted application safely through sandbox-exec command <body> I'm trying to run a potentially untrusted application without the following permissions, through the codesandbox-exec/code command:  ol lifile write (to avoid corruption/injection of files)/li linetwork (to avoid communicate outside of my network)/li liprocess creation (to avoid forks)/li liaccess to system data (to avoid system corruption)/li /ol  Let's suppose I need to run my application codeMyApp/code. I know it's possible to create a profile codemyprofile.sb/code such as the following one, but I'm not sure everything is included.  precode(version 1) (allow default) # bullet point #1 (deny file-write*) (deny file-write-data) # bullet point #2 (deny network*) # bullet point #3 (deny process-fork) (deny job-creation) (deny process-exec) # bullet point #4 (deny sysctl-write) # logging every action possible (trace "/tmp/myapp_output.sb") (debug all) /code/pre  At this point, I run the following command to run codeMyApp/code safely:  precodesandbox-exec -f ./myprofile.sb MyApp /code/pre  If I run sample commands (e.g. codeping google.it/code or codetouch /tmp/file.txt/code), the commands are executed correctly. Why? Am I missing something?
