Safari Bookmarklet - accessing DOM <body> I've tried following bookmarklets:     javascript:document.body.style.width='50%';   or     javascript:document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].width='50%';   They both work in console, but not in bookmarklet. What is the reason?  They both work fine as Chrome's bookmarklets.  Also, this bookmarklet works fine (on HTML5 videos):     javascript:document.getElementsByTagName("video")[0].playbackRate=2.5   <answer192387> Safari requires that a literal percent sign in a URL (code%/code) be URL-encoded in a bookmarklet (code%25/code...while it looks like that's just 25 added, the percent sign followed by two numbers is decoded to a literal percent sign). Also, the property is code.style.width/code, not just code.width/code.  Change your bookmarklet to this:  precodejavascript:document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].style.width='50%25'; /code/pre  I've confirmed this works in Safari v8.0.6 (OS X 10.10.3).  <comment228818> Oh my, thank you! How did you know!? <comment228819> Quick Google search! <comment228836> But how? What did you search? I've spend ages on Google. The biggest frustration was that it worked in console. <comment228837> I never got just `.width` working in console, which prompted me to add `.style`. As for my search, I think I used "Safari JavaScript bookmarklet" and it's the third result that led me down the URL encoding path. <comment228839> The percent sign works in console because it's not reading it from a URL, obviously, so it doesn't expect the percent sign to be encoded there. <comment228870> It does flash address bar for a second, although you can't execute JS from address bar in Safari.
