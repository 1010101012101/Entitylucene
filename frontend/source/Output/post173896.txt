Messages will not login; just sits and spins <body> Whenever I open Messages, enter my credentials, and attempt to login the status indicator spins forever and the application never authenticates me and loads.  I had this issue on Mavericks and still have it on Yosemite. I tried removing the frameworks for Messages/iMessage in OS X and even reinstalled the OS from the recovery partition, but nothing works.  Has anyone else had the same issue and any luck with resolving it? Thanks for your time!  <answer175202> My logic board was recently replaced in this Macbook and the vendor never serialized the newly installed logic board. I discovered this by going to "About This Mac" and seeing the serial number being reported as "Unknown".  The vendor corrected this actually applying a serial number to the logic board, which required specialized software that they had to boot off of from a DVD.  Once the serial number was applied then Messages worked just fine.  <comment204667> did you also fix your Permissions in Disk Utility? <comment204840> I did do this, but it did not help with my issue. <comment204847> could you log in to iTunes first than without logging out start messages. <comment205029> I am logged in to iTunes, but Messages still does not work. It continues to spin the status indicator for the login screen. <comment205032> so the problem is on your site. Could you look in the Console for any logs there. <comment205456> @Buscarì›ƒ, I see the following message in the console: 2/25/15 8:07:33.295 PM apsd[51]: Certificate doesn't match host
