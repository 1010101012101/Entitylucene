How do you script the allowance of Automator to control the computer? <body> I'm trying to script several app installations for MacBooks (running either El Capitan or Sierra).  My goal is to complete the whole process with minimal user interaction, except for possibly entering passwords.  It's very easy to record Automator workflows to do everything I want, but you have to allow Automator to control the computer by going to System Preferences/Security &amp; Privacy/Privacy/Accessibility, clicking the Lock icon, entering your password, adding /Applications/Automator.app, then checking the checkbox next to it.  Is there any way to script the allowance of Automator to control the computer with no more interaction with the user than entering their password?
