Get serial numbers of connected USB devices <body> I'm searching for a terminal command to find out the serial numbers of connected USB devices on macOS computers. Is there any equivalent to the linux command "usb-devices"? I tried "ioreg -p IOUSB" but the output does not contain the serial numbers.  <answer275395> strongInformation about USB Devices is stored differently under Linux then macOS:/strong  ul liIn strongLinux/strong, codeusb-devices/code is a codebash/code emscript/em that essentially reads a bunch of text files, symlinked to code/sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*/code, that contain information about the USB Devices and formats it in the output you see under Linux./li liIn strongmacOS/strong, it does not have such a emscript/em as it doesn't store the information in the same manner. However, if you want to output information about USB Devices that are enumerated by the OS, in Terminal, then use the following command:  precodesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType /code/pre  If a USB Device has a serial number it will be shown in the output./li /ul  hr  As mentioned by Allan in his comment, you can use the following command to minimize the output to include relevant portions of the device information that contain the device name and serial number with a bit of additional info.  precodesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep "Serial Number" -B5 /code/pre  Note that doing this does obscure some of the device information as compared to the info outputted by codeusb-devices/code, although it may be unnecessary info depending on your needs.  hr  strongAs an example, here is the codeusb-devices/code output, in Linux, for an 8 GB USB Flash Drive:/strong  precodeT:  Bus=03 Lev=02 Prnt=03 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  6 Spd=480 MxCh= 0 D:  Ver= 2.00 Cls=00(&gt;ifc ) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=64 #Cfgs=  1 P:  Vendor=0781 ProdID=5530 Rev=01.26 S:  Manufacturer=SanDisk S:  Product=Cruzer S:  SerialNumber=20042214412B1A33690E C:  #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=80 MxPwr=200mA I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=08(stor.)

Thank you. But, is this command also supported by older macOS versions? <comment346471> @Phelps, Yes both commands shown in the answer are supported in earlier versions of OS X/macOS.
