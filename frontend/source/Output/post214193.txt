Videos do not load on iPad Air since update <body> I can't watch videos on my IPad Air ever since I updated it. The loading screen just goes on forever on YouTube, Netflix, or watch Disney. I can't watch videos at all unless they are in my camera roll.  However videos from apps like Vine work.  <comment258557> Welcome to Ask Different.  To what version of iOS did you update? iOS 9?
