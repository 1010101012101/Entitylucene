Forward events / notifications to other phone <body> I would like to forward my iPhone notifications or alerts to an Android phone.   Is there a way/app to do this?  <answer178148> I think an App called "pushbullet" can probably do what you want.   Pushbullet by Pushbullet https://appsto.re/us/02ptW.i  Quick video of setup and demonstration: https://youtu.be/BVpUbJFLRvs  <comment211039> I looked at that indeed, but I think it's just a generic platform for push messaging, am I wrong? If not, could you explain how to set it up or find a manual to do so? <comment211076> My understanding is it forwards push notifications between devices.  I would reference this quick video on how to set it up: https://youtu.be/BVpUbJFLRvs <comment211105> Upon further review - looks like iOS to Mac requires Bluetooth.  So this probably isn't what you're looking for.
