iOS-iOS device real time sound transfering <body> I'd like to know if there's any way I could connect two iOS devices to transfer sound in real time. Sort of a walkie-talkie device. Anyone would know any apps for that?  Thanks :)  <answer88888> As per my comment, I think the key phrase to search for here would be Push-To-Talk (PTT). Take a look at the following:  Push to talk apps  <comment104216> The phone app? ;) <comment104218> I'd like one that could transfer more easily adressed, quickly and preferably free. <comment104219> Skype then, but I assume what you're looking for here is PushToTalk.
