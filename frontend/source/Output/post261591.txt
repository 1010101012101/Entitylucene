Enabling breaking news notifications on Sierra <body> On a new system running MacOS Sierra, how to enable notifications for the NY Times, or any other news source?  A client saw that my older MBP running Yosemite gets breaking news from the NY Times, and asked me to set it up on his shiny new 2016 MBP running Sierra. No joy -- neither Safari nor Firefox pop up a notifications request from nytimes.com.  Further, notifications cannot be added manually in System Preferences/Notifications or in Safari's Preferences/Notifications.  Is there some other way to do this?  Thanks.  <answer261760> Try this!

I've done this on other sites, not the Times, but I assume it's similar on that site. <comment327818> Bingo. Many thanks! <comment327819> Thanks for your response. Per the response below, it required clearing the Safari cache and restarting.
