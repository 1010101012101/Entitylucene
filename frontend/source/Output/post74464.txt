Why can't I search files and folders on my external NTFS drive on Mountain Lion? <body> I have tried to re-index my external drive by removing it from Spotlight's privacy settings and putting it back there. I tried with mdutil in the terminal and I've got the following log:  precodebb:~ bb$ mdutil -i on -d /Volumes/TOSHIBA\ EXT /Volumes/TOSHIBA EXT:     Indexing and searching disabled. bb:~ bb$ mdutil -i on /Volumes/TOSHIBA\ EXT /Volumes/TOSHIBA EXT:     Indexing enabled.  bb:~ bb$  /code/pre  I tried it with the root password and when I look for files on my external drive I still cannot find them through spotlight even though I know they are on the drive and I can find them by browsing folders.  Is there another way to index my drive?  <comment87734> Have you tried dragging the drive to the privacy pane in System PreferencesSpotlight and them removing it from there (as explained in http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13727_7-10330114-263.html)? Are you using Apple's NTFS driver (which only allows for read-only mounting) or something like NTFS-3G or Tuxera? <comment88168> I tried it more than once. <comment88227> What about the NTFS driver? Are you using Apple's, Tuxera's, or a driver from another vendor? <comment88228> I have another driver I had installed back then when I had Leopard. <comment88231> And, using your driver, can you write to the external NTFS drive or only read? <comment88238> write and read. I just cannot search. <comment89425> I had another ntfs drive before and I was able to search files on it, read and write. With this new drive I can only read and write I cannot search files. <comment256805> Same problem here (Mountain Lion, new NTFS drive, WD Elements 2TB). No search. And as I can see, no answer to this question.
