Hombrew is asking me for a version of Xcode the OS doesnt support <body> I need to download certain apps through homebrew, one of them being pygtk, but when putting the rather simple command that should install it homebrew says my Xcode (6.4 because I am on Yosemite) is outdated and that need the 7.2.1 which I can't install because it's not supported in Yosemite. How can I fix this?   <answer254368> This may mean that you can't install pygtk through homebrew on Yosemite. You may still be able to compile from source, even with your version of Xcode.  <answer254404> You could see this answer on stackoverflow which tells us Xcode 7.2.1 is the last support Xcode for Yosemite and supplies a URL for those with a developer account (Xcode_7.2.1.dmg). The URL appears to be valid (starts a download). I've used Xcode 7.2 on Yosemite.  <comment316654> Macports has different versions for each OSX version for this and other reasons so if Homebrew does not have this set of separate releases then you are out of luck, <comment316671> Thank you, I will look up if homebrew has different versions for different OS <comment316672> Thanks, I will try to find a way to do that, was hoping that there was a fix since it's not with just that app that the error appears. I guess I am out of luck.
