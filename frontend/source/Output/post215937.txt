Unmute audio input (microphone) in OSX programatically <body> strongOSX 10.10.3/strong, also reproducible on 10.8, doesn't seem to happen on 10.11   h1Reproduction steps/h1  ol liGo to System preferences  Audio  Input /li liSet input volume to strong0/strong (this is important)/li liRun this script in Terminal   precodesudo osascript -e "set volume input volume 100" /code/pre/li liThis script should set mic to max volume and strongun-mute/strong it accordingly, but for Mac OS &lt; 10.11, the microphone stays muted, despite of the fact that the input volume bar is now set to maximum./li /ol  h1Edition 2/h1  The following AppleScript works:  precodetell application "System Events"     set volume input volume 100 end tell  tell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.sound" end tell  tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"        set visible to false        click radio button "input" of tab group 1 of window "Sound"        perform action "AXIncrement" of slider 1 of group 2 of tab group 1 of window "Sound"     end tell end tell  tell application "System Preferences"     quit end tell /code/pre  But unfortunately it cannot be executed without a permission from user to Accessibility (that requires relatively difficult actions from user).  h1Edition 3/h1  Tried to kill coreaudiod, VDCAssistant. Kext unload/load is very dangerous and not reliable, shouldn't be considered.  h1Need help/h1  ul liCan you reproduce it in OSX &lt; 10.11? /li liIs there any other way to fix this bug? Terminal commands? Triggering some apps? Killing some processes? Modifying some plists? Anything else?/li /ul  <comment260904> Why is it a bug - I don't want programs turning my mic on without explicitly choosing to <comment260908> Skype does it somehow. When you start a call you "give your permission" to turn your microphone... because you start a call! I mean sometimes it makes sense. And it is a bug, because the script works in 10.11. I don't even mind to ask a user a computer password if needed. <comment260915> set volume without output muted - set volume with output muted <comment260916> Is it about output volume, not input volume? <comment260918> It's probably the same syntax with input, isn't it ? <comment260919> It is not. There is no "muting" functionality for mic (at least on 10.10, I haven't tried 10.11 yet). Even in System Preferences you can mute output volume, but you cannot do it with mic.
