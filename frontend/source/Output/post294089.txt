202 GB in "com.apple.bird" <body> I've read that com.apple.bird, is a part of icloud on Mac but mine is 202GB!! is taking a lot of my iMac space.  Can anyone help me?br Some say it is not safe to delete this cache, but I need to find a way to clean this one up.  Thanks.  <answer294091> To find out exactly what is taking up the space, follow these steps:  ol liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key while you click on the Go menu/li liSelect Library/li liYou can let go of the kbdoption/kbd key now/li liWithin the Library folder open the Caches folder/li liNow you'll see a com.apple.bird folder/li /ol  Now you can browse within this folder to determine what's taking up the space.  If you happen to have WhatsApp installed and it's taking up a lot of the space, then refer to my answer to this question  <comment371227> I wonder if we need to find the main thread for this for a canonical answer. - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/268112/why-does-icloud-take-up-30-gigs-of-storage-on-my-mac <comment371266> Agreed. I'm sure I've answered a couple of similar questions to this one. The only thing is I wonder whether it's actually three canonical answers we need: 1. *What is com.apple.bird?*, 2. *How can I see what's taking up space in com.apple.bird?*, and 3. *How can I free up space in com.apple.bird?* (Is that too many, or can we combine 2 or more?) <comment371267> Perhaps [Tetsujin's answer](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/220008/168832) is the canonical answer to the first one? It's not clear to me whether the answer to the 3rd one is the same regardless of the data, but if so perhaps my answer [here](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/281269/168832) is a possible candidate?
