How to deal with retina images on iBooks Author? <body> I want basically insert an image as a background for a page on a books I am creating on iBooks Author. My question is this: I have a retina version of the full screen image (iPad) that is 2048 x 1536 and another non-retina image that is half the size of that.  I want to create a book that appears at maximum resolution for those with retina ipads and scaled down for those non-retina.   I suspect I have to work with the retina image but when I drag the image to the page, the image appears with 575 x 379 pixels (What?). I have scaled the image to 1024x768 that is page size of iBooks Author. So, what now? Is that it? Will the image be scaled down for non-retina devices? Is this the way you work with retina images on iBA?  thanks
