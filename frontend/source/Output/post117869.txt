How do I install GCC and make on a mac without administrator access or using Xcode? <body> I'd like to install gcc and make on my Macbook Air, but I don't have root access on it. I found this link through searching on google, but I have no idea how to set up the prefix's so that the actual codegcc/code executable can find the libraries. I have a directory set up with node.js and git installed at code~/usr/local/code and I'd like to install GCC there also. I have no idea where to start with make. Can anyone help? :D  <answer117936> The best way to install the gcc toolchain without using Apple's command line tools is to use Homebrew.  After installing Homebrew then   precodebrew tap homebrew/versions &amp;&amp; brew install apple-gcc49 brew link --force apple-gcc49 ln -nsf $(which gcc-4.9) /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 /code/pre  should have you working.  You can find more details here: http://new-bamboo.co.uk/blog/2013/10/24/3-quick-tips-for-coding-with-os-x-10-9-mavericks  Note that the gcc toolchain includes make.  <answer141918> If you don't have administrator access to your machine, you are still be able to install pre-compiled binary software inside your home directories. Create a folder in your home directory called usr and a directory inside that one called bin, if you want to match the standard directory structure of where make and gcc usually reside.  you can find a gnu make binary for os x here  about make  you can find a download link for a gcc binary for os x here  about gcc  Using these tools successfullly without sudo (admin or root) access is altogether another thing... and you didn't ask about that, and I can't answer that, anyway. It seems like it would be easier to gain admin access through various methods available on the web than to try to build software without admin access. But this, of course, is not part of your question. Best of luck!  (and FYI, I'm pretty sure Brew requires xcode, and if you can get xcode installed, brewnistas enthusiam for Brew notwithstanding, MacPorts is far far more resiliant and mature than Brew)  <comment151609> This still needs root access <comment151947> No it doesn't. It requires that you are a member of the 'admin' group or you install Homebrew in somewhere you have write access such as '~/usr/local' - neither of which is 'root access' <comment151948> Sorry I was sloppy re root access (as I think the question was) I meant sudo etc - but the install localally should be in in the answer
