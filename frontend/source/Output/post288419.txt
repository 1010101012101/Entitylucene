Mark up tool for Notes in macOS <body> Is there a way to use the mark up tool in notes? Or something that works like that would? I want to be able to put shapes with text on top of copy pasted images. So I want to use a shape, be able to type text on the shape then put it on top of a image.   <answer288423> With the image inserted in Notes, choose the disclosure arrow from the top-right of the image (shown on hover) and select Markup.                                                         img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/On1lt.png" width="199"  From here you have access to the standard markup tools including shapes and text.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wjVU.png" alt=""  <comment364226> Thank you, now I'm curious about that repair tool! <comment364227> @user [That's an extension provided by Pixelmator.](http://www.pixelmator.com/retouch-extension/)
