How do I merge System partition with another HFS+ partition without data loss? <body> My hard drive is split in three visible partitions: strongSystem/strong, strongData/strong and strongBackup/strong.br I'd like to merge strongSystem/strong (OS X Lion) and strongData/strong into one partition without data loss.  strongDisk Utility/strong won't let me resize the system partition:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LxRC6.png" alt="partitions in disk utility"  That's my complete setup:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rc73Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Apparently, I can't use codemergePartitions/code because diskutil man says:     codemergePartitions [force] format name fromDevice toDevice/code      Merge two or more partitions on a disk.br   All data on merged partitions other than the first will be lost.   I can imagine decreasing strongData/strong size, creating a strongNew/strong partition, moving all files from strongData/strong to strongNew/strong and proceeding with codemergePartitions/code, thus merging strongSystem/strong and strongData/strong into strongSystem+Data/strong. Then I probably can move stuff from strongNew/strong to the merged strongSystem+Data/strong partition and merge them all.  However I'm unsure what will happen to strongRecovery HD/strong that stands between strongSystem/strong and strongData/strong. Will it get erased? If so, how can I restore it?  <answer40790> strongThere is absolutely no way that you should even emthink/em about doing any of this without a complete backup on a separate disk. Verify the backup before beginning./strong  1) If you have a complete backup, the easiest way to do this would be to wipe everything, make the partitions you want, and then copy the information back from your backup. If your Recovery HD is deleted, there is no way to re-create it without reinstalling the OS. (At least none that I could find when I was searching recently.)  2) Assuming you have a backup emOTHER/em than that Backup partition, if you want to attempt to merge these, I would try it in this order:   a. Delete the 'Backup' partition.  b. Merge 'Data' partition and former 'Backup' partition.  c. Merge System partition and other partition.  d. Re-create the 'Backup' partition and restore it from whatever backup you have.  I have done several live-system partition resizings with no problems. However, the one time that there was a problem, I had to reformat the entire drive and start over.  <answer40795> I marked TJ Luoma's answer as correct since his approach looks cleaner, however I decided to take a risk and do a live resizing. In case this might help someone plan their own steps, I leave here a list of my actions. They may not be most rational or correct but they worked for me.  strongTHIS IS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VERIFIED, FULL BACKUP./strong    No, really. strongYou can lose all your data, including the system. Don't do it./strongbr And this will work strongonly if Data partition is less than 45% full/strong.br And I'm not even sure this will work for you anyway.  You have been warned.  hr  My steps were as follows:  ol liBoot into Recovery HD loader by pressing kbd⌘/kbdkbdR/kbd during the boot./li liOpen Disk Utility, select my HDD and open strongPartition/strong tab./li listrongSystem/strong partition now has a resize grip. However it is “blocked” by strongData/strong partition that comes right after it. I don't have much information on strongData/strong so I split it equally in two partitions—let's call them strongData A/strong and strongData B/strong. strongData A/strong is large enough to fit everything strongData/strong contained. strongData B/strong is empty./li liClick strongApply/strong/li liSelect the disk (the first root item in left pane), open strongFirst Aid/strong tab and click strongVerify Disk/strong. Wait for the verification to end./li liNow we want to move everything from strongData A/strong to strongData B/strong. I selected strongData emA/em/strong in the left pane, clicked strongRestore/strong tab and dragged strongData emB/em/strong to the Destination field. Source is strongA/strong, destination is strongB/strong./li liClick strongRestore/strong and wait for strongData A/strong to be copied into strongData B/strong./li liAgain, select the disk (the first root item in left pane), open strongFirst Aid/strong tab and click strongVerify Disk/strong. Wait for the verification to end./li liNow you have two identical partitions, strongData A/strong and strongData B/strong. The first one prevents strongSystem/strong from resizing. Open strongPartition/strong tab, select strongData emA/em/strong and click the minus glyph (it may not be visible so I included an image—it's just below the list).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPuFV.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect the disk (the first root item in left pane), open strongFirst Aid/strong tab and click strongVerify Disk/strong. Wait for the verification to end./li liGo to strongPartition/strong tab and resize strongSystem/strong so it takes space that was previously owned by strongData A/strong and now is unallocated. Click strongApply/strong./li liSelect the disk (the first root item in left pane), open strongFirst Aid/strong tab and click strongVerify Disk/strong. Wait for the verification to end./li liRename strongData B/strong to just strongData/strong so your volume name doesn't change./li liQuit Disk Utility and boot into OS X./li liCopy whatever data you need from strongData/strong to strongSystem/strong (it has enough space now)./li liCheck you emreally/em copied the files you need./li liCheck again./li liAre you sure?!/li liOpen Disk Utility in OS X, remove strongData/strong and resize strongSystem/strong. /li liI wish you the best of luck./li /ol  <answer47171> You don't need to merge them.  You can resize partitions right?  Do such a socoban:  ol liMake a backup /li liShrink 'Data' partition (leave just a couple gigabytes free)./li liEnlarge 'Backup' partition so you can put stuff from 'Data' somewhere (at least temporary)./li liPut everything from 'Data' in some folder on 'Backup'/li liMake sure that 'Data' is empty and delete it./li liNow you must have a lot of free space between 'System' and 'Backup' so you can grow 'System' partition or redistribute space between them as you like :)/li /ol  <comment54050> This will not work because a partition's start position is fixed. Shrinking Data partition still wouldn't let me resize the Backup partition “upwards” as it would involve moving the data (which Disk Utility apparently cannot do). However I could shrink Data partition *and* use **unallocated space** for that, [which I did](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/40795/9102).
