Is it possible to add an Apple compatible remote control to an audio cable for headphones? <body> I'm wondering whether there is some TRRS extension cable available which has a remote control for volume and play/pause that would allow to extend any headphones by a remote control, or alternatively whether I could build one myself using the remote control from broken Apple earbuds.  <answer248787> Yes, there are lots of them, check eBay, amazon, probably aliexpress. Here is a link for the search on eBay: http://goo.gl/OBkbIc  Keywords I used are: iphone extension cable remote.  Most of them have a microphone as well.
