Executing files directly from read/write WebDAV server <body> I’m using the Finder’s built-in codeConnect to Server.../code feature and use it for connecting to a read/write WebDAV server. Everything is working except executing files hosted on the server. I tried mounting the server using the codemount_webdav/code Terminal command, and got the same result as using the Finder. Running codels -laF /Volumes/webdav/code results in:  precodedrwx------  1 myname  staff    2048 Mar 15 14:09 ./ drwxrwxrwt  4 root    admin     170 Mar 15 09:25 ../ -rwx------  ... drwx------  ... -rwx------  ... drwx------  ... ... /code/pre  Which makes me assume that files should be executable. However, executing a bash script from the server in Terminal results in:  precodebash: /Volumes/webdav/test.sh: /bin/bash: bad interpreter: Permission denied /code/pre  I just want to be able to execute these files without having to move them to a physical disk. What am I overlooking?  EDIT: per request of @patrix, here are the commands i used:  precodemkdir /Volumes/webdav mount_webdav -i -s https://example.com/program/ /Volumes/webdav/ chmod +x /Volumes/webdav/test.sh head /Volumes/webdav/test.sh /Volumes/webdav/test.sh /code/pre  and the output was:  precode#mount_webdav Username: ‹username› Password:  # head #!/bin/bash mkdir /tmp/tex cd /tmp/tex cp -RX /Volumes/webdav/tex/* . xelatex report.tex open report.pdf # exec bash: /Volumes/webdav/test.sh: /bin/bash: bad interpreter: Permission denied /code/pre  <comment208879> Can you run `head /Volumes/webdav/test.sh` and `mount`, then add the output of both to the question? <comment208984> OP updated! The bash script works as intended when I copy it to the system disk. The issue *has* to be related to the server volume. <comment209053> Can you just run `mount` without any options and include the output as well? The volume could be mounted with a "noexec" option set. <comment311097> I have the same problem, and yes, the volume is mounted noexec. Is there any way to prevent that?
