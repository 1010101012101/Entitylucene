Mac OS Installer Error <body> I've formatted my old laptop in order to install Lion 10.7.3 version on it. During the installation process it came up with a weird looking error message, similar to the one in the next picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQZs8.jpg" alt="Install Failed - Mac OS X could not be installed on your computer"  I'm wondering what's causing this issue and what can I do in order to solve the problem. It's a bit hard for me, a veteran Windows user, to get along with this type of OS.  Thanks in advance.  <answer99420> The error message strongem"Mac OS X Lion couldn't be install, because the disk Macintosh HD is damaged and can't be repaired."/em/strong in the photo above would indicate that there is either a  problem with the physical hard drive of your Mac or the Mac's "Macintosh HD" volume is damaged at a software level.  While you're in the installer you can click on emWindow  Installer/em Log to view a log from the Lion installer.  This may give you some clues as to what is causing the error.  For instance, any mention of "Disk I/O Error" would be an indicator that there is a communication problem with the hard drive at a hardware level.  You can also attempt to repair the Macintosh HD volume using emDisk Utility/em (should be accessible from the Lion installer's emUtility/em menu), or reformat it again if the repair fails.  Once repaired or reformatted you can attempt the installation again.  Hopefully that helps.  <comment116942> It is the same issue as `format c:` failing the disk is broken <comment116951> The explanation is in the error message: `damaged disk`. What's the doubt? <comment116987> It worked just fine on the third try, there was nothing wrong with the disk. Thanks anyway.
