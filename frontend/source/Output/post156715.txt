Should I need Terms and Conditions to validate my app? <body> I built a solid application that I want to validate by Apple.  As being a social network, Terms and conditions are essential, of course.br However, I want to beta test my applications through a few amount of users (50 for instance).          So I wonder 2 things:   ul liMy lawyer (in new technlogies) is about to write those Terms and Conditions.br Should I wait for them, before sending my app through iTunes Connect?br Or isn't Apple strict for that? /li liMy app connects through Facebook.br What is the usual place to put the CGU screen?br Before, or after the Facebook connection?/li /ul  <comment184362> The question of whether to launch with or without terms and conditions is a question for your lawyer. We cannot give you legal advice. You also appear to be asking if Apple will be OK with that. I'm not seeing anything in the review guidelines that requires T&Cs for apps to pass review. What is the "CGU" screen? <comment184535> Indeed, sorry for the CGU term, it's a French acronym: Conditions Générales d'utilisation. <comment184536> Generally I would think you would want the T&Cs before registration/Facebook connection, but again your lawyer may have a legal view on it. <comment184537> Yes, it makes sense to have it before. Will ask him ;)
