Mac replace Apple Lockscreen <body> I have created a program in codeNode.JS/code which is a lockscreen. I want this application to start whenever a macosx screen is opened or basically when the mac wakes up. The first time the Mac start or is powered up I want it to use the default lockscreen because I need to collect data about the user that will be signed in every time the mac comes awake after sleep.  The application uses the Electron framework with Node.jS integration, the Electron window uses Kiosk mode to prevent exiting the window, I have prevented ALL key binds to eventually disable: Exiting Electron, Closing the window, moving to other screens/desktops, disabling function keys, disabled DesktopView, disabled AppView, disabled Music Keys.  Here's a little algorithm I want to use.  ol liMac startup: Use default lockscreen for collecting data about the user/li liMac is being used./li liMac goes to sleep./li liMac gets waked up./li liMy Lockscreen turns immediately on and forcing MacOSX to disable/replacing the default lockscreen./li liUser successfully signs in/li liMy lockscreen quits./li /ol  Is there anyway to achieve this?  strongEDIT/strong Is there anyway to tweak the system to "disable" lockscreen after first time login in that "use-session".  Basically something like scheduling my program to launch after the mac awakes?  <comment361181> This sounds like an XY problem. Why do you want to replace the default lock screen? <comment361182> So my own lockscreen will be default so my lockscreen will be seen instead of Apple's lockscreen <comment361183> You're just doing it to do it, or is there a reason you want to replace Apple's lock screen? <comment361185> Yes, I am working on a bigger project which is an mod to Apple's display system.. Basically I can customize themes and Apple's menu bar, etc. First step is to gain permissions with the lockscreen. I have the project planned out and documented for myself. <comment361186> That sort of project is very difficult if not impossible to do on a Mac, because much of the display system is closed-source, and not designed to be modified externally in any way, except for those ways approved by Apple. If you want to do such a thing, Linux would be a better platform. <comment361188> That is true, but it is VERY possible to do such things, while interacting with the Apple's root user it can access its `closed-source`, my program will have an installation process that needs to be done once, basically a launcher to launch the displays. But look away from that right now, the question is how to replace Apple's lockscreen after the user have signed in once with the default lockscreen... <comment361201> What about replacing the standard lockscreen app (/System/Library/CoreServices/loginwindow.app) with your own? <comment361203> Yes, but take in mind that I will then be unable to retrieve the user information, the algorithm I have planned requires the user to have logged in once VIA the Apple's lockscreen
