Safari keeps deleting items from my reading list <body> My safari's reading list is "one shot", in the sense that if I open a URL it gets deleted, so I can just read it once. But some articles are long and I read them in 3-4 times. How do I change this behavior? I'd like that reading list items could be removed just manually.  <answer191578> They're not being deleted, they're just read and you're hiding read items. Show unread items in reading list by clicking the Show Unread button above the list.
