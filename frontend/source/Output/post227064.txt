How to purchase non-DRM versions of Apple Music-based playlist <body> For an event, I have created a playlist of music based mostly on Apple Music tracks (and some that I had purchased pre-Apple Music). I need to deliver non-DRM versions of all these tracks to a DJ for the event. Is there a way to simply purchase all of the songs in a playlist from the iTunes Store?
