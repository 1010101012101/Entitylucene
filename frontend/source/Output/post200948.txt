Single keystroke shortcut to undo autocorrect <body> Is it possible to quickly revert an autocorrect with a single keystroke or combination?  As described in Shortcut to revert autocorrect change , the "correct" way to do it is:  ol libackspace/li liwait/li lidown-arrow  /li lienter/li lispace/li /ol  This is far too slow, and I often reflexively hit Command-Z instead, which has other unintended effects.  Are there other options, ideally without the use of backspace, arrows, or waiting?  Any advice welcome, Thank you!  <answer200951> Try this:  kbdâ†‘/kbd up arrow after you type the word that autocorrects, but before hitting the spacebar.  This should dismiss the autocorrect without making the change in the first place.  <comment242253> Clever, and successful, if anticipated.  Unfortunately I rarely expect this before hitting spacebar, and a solution that would work after hitting the spacebar would be ideal.  Thank you! <comment242256> I hear ya. Hope we can find a simpler solution.
