iPhone: Disable vibration for all notifications except for phone calls <body> How can I disable vibrations for all notifications except for phone calls on an iPhone? This is for an iPhone 6 running iOS 8.  For instance, if I receive a notification such as a new email, my phone vibrates. And when I get phone calls, my phone vibrates. But when I disable vibration, it disables vibration for both notifications and phone calls.  So I'd like to separate the two, so that I don't get vibrations for notifications, but I do get vibrations for phone calls.  Is there a way to do this, without needing to enable vibrations and disabling vibrations on an app-by-app basis?  <answer148855> The only way I know is to go to iPhone Settings  Notifications and modify the settings for each app so that Vibration is set to None.  <answer201065> You can turn off vibrations for individual events from Settings  Sounds.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/59uep.jpg" height="350" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1t24r.jpg" height="350" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/POaGY.jpg" height="350"  You can turn them all off, turn off all but Ringtone (receiving phone calls), or keep them all on.  strongNote:/strong Any events that are not listed here can be turned off from the apps that produce them.  <comment175329> I don't see an option for Vibration for apps in Notifications. I think "Sound" will achieve this instead? <comment175336> My mistake: I was basing my answer of the settings for Mail, since I was already in there. But Mail is unique, I see now that most apps do not let you set the vibration independently of the sound. <comment175338> Yeah, it seems like most of the search results that come up specifically refer to Mail... but I'm interested in all apps. And I use the Gmail app rather than the Mail app for my emails, anyway. I think the "Sound" setting is tied to "Vibration" for most apps.
