How can I dim the screen from Terminal? <body> Is it possible to dim the screen from Terminal, in a Mac with OS X Lion? Is there any command to do control brightness and volume?  <answer34885> You can do it via an Applescript and run it as such:  Dimmer:   precodetell application "System Events"         key code 107     end tell /code/pre  Brighter:    precodetell application "System Events"         key code 113     end tell /code/pre  You can save these as .script files and then run them from the CLI like this:  precodeosascript ~/Path/to/File /code/pre  You can also do it this way, but that requires more setup.  <answer127258> You can install this command line tool from github.com/nriley/brightness. The install is pretty easy if you have homebrew:  precodebrew install brightness /code/pre  And usage is straightforward:  ul liSet 100% brightness: codebrightness 1/code/li liSet 50% brightness: codebrightness 0.5/code/li /ul  Unfortunately it doesn't work for external monitors. See Does Apple support DDC/CI for  3rd party displays via Apple&#39;s Thunderbolt to DVI adapter for background on why.  <answer195761> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zx9Yv.png" alt="screenshot"  I've created a node module for this that supports setting the brightness using the CLI. See https://github.com/kevva/brightness-cli.  precodenpm install --global brightness-cli /code/pre  And then simply just run codebrightness/code from your command line.  <comment253715> For me, these instructions installed a command called  `brightness`, not `screenbrightness`. Otherwise, this worked as described. Thanks! <comment300153> Doesn't work for me: `$ brightness 100  /usr/local/lib/node_modules/brightness-cli/cli.js:3 const brightness = require('brightness'); ^^^^^ SyntaxError: Use of const in strict mode.     at Module._compile (module.js:439:25)     at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)     at Module.load (module.js:356:32)     at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)     at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)     at startup (node.js:119:16)     at node.js:902:3` <comment364470> I think it have to do with a github merge of projects. When that happened they updated the command to `brightness` (which someone in Community happily already fixed in the answer).
