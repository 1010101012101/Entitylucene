Shortcut to open the Goto window in file open/save dialogues WITH the equivalent to path added <body> When you have a file open/save prompt box open, you can hit the kbd//kbd key to open a GoTo dialouge to navigate via the file path.   strongIs there a shortcut that does this action but automatically adds the code.//code/strong  ie. hitting the shortcut would open a box looking like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Knnpm.png" alt="Goto Box in Open/Save prompts"  em(where normally the period at the beginning is missing)/em  <answer65107> You just have to delete the automatically added code//code in the beginning. The Go To box works from the current directory in the background.  For example if I open my home folder and press /, the Go To box opens with a code//code already there. If I want to work from the current directory (code.//code), i.e., codehome/code, I just have to delete that code//code.  Now, if I type code./Desktop/code and press enter, or just codeDesktop/code and press enter, the result would be the same.  <comment76476> muchas gracias amigo! <comment76507> Youâ€™re welcome!
