Reduce size of the Xcode application <body> Is there anyway to reduce the disk space used to store the Xcode application? I only downloaded Xcode so that I could compile C and C++, so if possible I would like it to take up much less than the 9.22GB it requires right now. Perhaps there are optional portions I can uninstall?  <answer287309> Although it's not directly related to the Xcode app size. There are multiple places where you can delete files to free up some space.  strong1. Derived Data/strong Xcode keeps data about your projects which includes index, build output and logs. Go to code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData//code and delete the folders for projects that you no longer need to keep this data around for.  strong2. iOS Device Support/strong Xcode is storing information about the devices you have used for development. Delete the data no longer needed in code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport//code.  strong3. Archives/strong Delete the one’s you don’t need in the Organizer, or go to code~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives//code to delete them in bulk. Be careful not to delete archives for which you still need the dSYM data for debugging.  strong4. Simulators/strong Simulators are stored under code~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/code. For each version of iOS you are building for.  strong5. Documentation/strong Browse and delete unnecessary data under code~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets/code.  <answer287311> Perhaps a more elegant solution would to be use the command line tools instead of Xcode.  You could delete Xcode entirely (or skip the install). Instead of downloading and installing Xcode - open the command line (terminal app works out of the box) and type gcc.  That will pop up a window where you can install the command line tools. Click install, click agree and the C compilers and libraries and debuggers will all download and install.  On 10.11 the command line tools take about 200 MB of disk space. The dmg to install the Xcode 9 version beta command line tools is less than that as well, so it’s a pretty slim set of tools if you want to preserve disk space and can use another IDE / editor and don’t need all the features Xcode provides.  <comment362722> I only have 3 folders in `Xcode`: `DerivedData`,`iOS Device Logs`, and `UserData`. The first two folders are zero KB, and `UserData` is only 8KB. I do not have a `CoreSimulator` folder in `Developer`. I already deleted the DocSets, which were taking up an additional ~2.5GB on top of the 9.22 that Xcode is using.
