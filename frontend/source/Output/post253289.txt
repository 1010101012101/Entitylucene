Dragging and dropping from Finder to new external hard drive -- zero bytes! <body> So I see from others that this is not an unusual problem, but the answers I've read are not clear to me, so thought I'd try my own thread.  I just bought a My Passport for Mac 1 TB drive. First thing I did was take a back-up of my laptop via Time Machine.  Then I wanted to start saving some photos onto it. Step one was to clear out about 1000 screen shots I've taken that are sitting in Finder on my Desktop.  All that happened is that my passport drive is now showing all the files, but greyed out and with 0 bytes. It's hung up.  In the simplest of terms, what do I need to do now to a) clear out the 0 byte files on the passport now, and b) copy the desktop png images to the passport drive?  <comment315199> Did you copy the files to the other drives root folder, create a new folder or placed it in the actual folder that time machine backs up to? <comment315239> I only did two things with the external drive today. <comment315240> The first thing I did was run Time Machine by following its wizard. I did a backup of everything. <comment315241> The second thing I did was highlight all the items on my desktop via Finder, and dragged and dropped them to the external drive in the left-hand menu. Now the external drive can't be ejected, nor any of the grey-out items in there sent to trash because they're all "in current use". <comment315243> Just looking at the external drive, there is a separate folder for the backups, then hundreds and hundreds of single items, mostly png -- these are not in the backup folder
