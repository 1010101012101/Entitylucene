How to enable/disable OS X beta participation from Terminal? <body> h2Does anyone know how to enable/disable OS X beta participation from the Terminal?/h2  Typically one could opt-out of the Beta program by choosing the following option found in the App Store preferences pane. However once you opt out, the option to opt-in disappears and one has to use a utility found online to opt in again. This is tedious for me. Since most settings in OS X are managed using defaults, I wonder if anyone has a set of commands to enable/disable this option in the preference pane?   If not then perhaps a process where I can discover the relevant defaults read/write statements to enable this feature?  Ultimately, I would like to simply be able to opt-in during certain periods and opt-out during other times.  If there is a simpler approach than using the Terminal, I am open to learning about that as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1vNl.png" alt="beta"     Nota Bene - Please let me know in the comments if anything is unclear   or if more information is necessary to improve this question.

After that you can use the codesoftwareupdate/code command to enable and disable the beta/pre-release source.  You can disable it via:     softwareupdate --clear-catalog   Enabling is a bit more tricky, because you need to choose your channel/source. The options are:  OS X Public Beta     sudo softwareupdate --set-catalog   https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.12beta-10.12-10.11-10.10-10.9-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog.gz   OS X Developer Beta catalog     sudo softwareupdate --set-catalog   https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.12seed-10.12-10.11-10.10-10.9-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog.gz   OS X Gold Master catalog     sudo softwareupdate --set-catalog   https://swscan.apple.com/content/catalogs/others/index-10.12-10.11-10.10-10.9-mountainlion-lion-snowleopard-leopard.merged-1.sucatalog.gz   <comment283654> Be aware that if the beta enrollment is under NDA - many people will decline to answer here and you might need to discuss this on Apple's forums. Have you looked at whatever package, script or profile is used to enroll? Poking there might yield some clues as to what key in the defaults database might be related. <comment283660> sorry to pick nits, but what part of this is "from the terminal" which seems to be the main point the OP wants to learn. <comment283678> Just using `softwareupdate -h`, gives you very basic information on the command. <comment283679> I read it as If there is a simpler approach than using the Terminal I thought he meant other than terminal <comment283682> Thanks, I was using man softwareupdate and several options were not showing. Any pointers on how does one determine what catalog options are available? <comment283691> No direct answer, but you might be helped by https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=15064 and https://gist.github.com/geoff-codes/c7b38d695af39c4e1535
