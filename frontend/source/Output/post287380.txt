iPhone automatic updates is a puzzle <body> I'm trying to understand the strongautomatic download/strong on iPhone.  On Apple's documentation it specifically states:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3sBH.png" alt="If you turn on Updates, any new versions of apps that you currently have on your device automatically download when they&#39;re available."  My setting is set to download apps automatically:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jihcF.png" width="375" height="667"/  However, I have tons of apps waiting to be updated:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OcqIx.png" width="375" height="667"/  <answer287384> In the "More about Automatic Downloads" section:      If your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch has an Internet connection and you   turn on Push Notifications, your content automatically downloads to   your device. On an associated device that doesn't support Push   Notifications, your content automatically appears in your iTunes   download queue. You can manually download the content in iTunes.   I had turned off push notifications for the App Store and automatic updates stopped working. After I turned it on again it started working as usual.  <comment362837> It'll only update when connected to power and Wi-Fi <comment362864> @Harcker - well it's connected to WiFi and power for hours now and nothing gets updated... <comment362865> sorry, but I have push turned on for App Store and still need to manually update apps.
