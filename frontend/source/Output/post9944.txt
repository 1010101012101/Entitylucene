Disable Safari plugin without (re)moving the file <body> I've been Flash-free in Safari (5.0.3, my primary browser) for a while now, using Chrome with its bundled Flash Player whenever I have to.  I'm also developing a little bit in Flash for school, and have ended up using the Flash Debug Player, since it's really convenient to use codetrace/code for debugging.  I tried just putting the Debug Player inside my codeGoogle Chrome.app/code, similar to how the existing Flash Player is located, but Chrome refused to detect this, so I had to put it in code/Library/Internet Plug-ins/code, and now Safari detects it too.  Is there any way I can get Safari to ignore this plugin, or something that makes sure Chrome can find it, and not Safari?  <answer11202> Maybe just use the clicktoflash extension (also available from Safari Extensions Gallery)?  <answer11210> You have to rename the Flash debug plugin, in order to be available to Chrome.  ul liGo to 'Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/10.0.../Internet Plug-ins' /li lidelete the 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'/li liput there your debug 'Flash Player.plugin'/li lirename it to 'Flash Player Plugin for Chrome.plugin'/li lirestart Chrome/li /ul  <comment11753> I know that's a possibility, but iirc, there are some sites that detect you have Flash support installed, and use Flash instead of HTML5 for video for examples, so would like to avoid that.. <comment11754> I think I tried that once before, but I'll give it another try to be sure when I get home again <comment11758> @perfectlynormal I tried that way to install a newer version of Flash into Chrome and it did worked! Let me know of you have any issues.. <comment11862> Looks like it worked :) Must've done something wrong last time. Probably typoed something... <comment11863> I'm glad it worked! Thank you for the gift :) <comment146057> Won't this be automatically overwritten with a new release of Flash by Chrome's autoupdate? <comment146058> @GhostLyrics of course it will...
