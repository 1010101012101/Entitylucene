Changing read permissions on /private/etc recursively <body> I was trying to make my /private/etc folder and all its contents world-readable. 'Permission denied' messages from a number of internal files and folders were a recurrent theme whenever I did a find operation on that folder. But codechmod -R/code seems to have failed here. Can someone please explain why I get this error message and what I should do to fix it? I'm on OS X 10.8.3.  precode$ sudo chmod -R a+r /private/etc sudo: /private/etc/sudoers is mode 0444, should be 0440 sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting /code/pre  In fact any read operation in the directory seems to fail:  precode$sudo stat /private/etc/raddb/sql/sqlite  sudo: /private/etc/sudoers is mode 0444, should be 0440 sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting /code/pre  <answer98351> Changing the permissions on code/private/etc/sudoers/code is definitely a no-no. The codesudo/code command will fail to work if that file's permissions are not code0440/code as you are noticing. This is a security measure -- the command distrusts any permission setting that is less restrictive than code0440/code as it allows for potential tampering with sudo permissions on the box.  Normally you'd boot in to single user mode to fix this problem. This lets you log in with elevated privledges so you can do a:  precodechmod 440 /private/etc/sudoers /code/pre  and get your codesudo/code command back.  But I found this article that had an alternative that doesn't require a reboot and works if your account has Administrator level access. I haven't tried it, but it seems sound.  Open a Finder window a hit codeShift-Command-G/code to get the "Go To" dialog. Enter code/private/etc/code in the dialog and hit the codeGo/code button.  Find the codesudoers/code file in the Finder window, select it and press codeCommand-I/code to open the information window for the file and change the permissions on the file so they match:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qXRU9.png" alt="Permissions for your sudoers file"  Close the information window and you should be back in business.  All this being said: I would strongly encourage you to rethink changing the permissions of everything under code/private/etc/code to be world readable. This poses a serious security risk (as seen from the way codesudo/code locks you out when you make code/private/etc/sudoers/code world readable) to your machine. Maybe there's another Ask Different question here that'll help you solve a problem you think you're solving by making these unsafe changes?  <comment115445> I would strongly encourage you to rethink changing the permissions of everything under `/private/etc` to be world readable.

Honestly, I hadn't thought it through. Your pointers are very helpful though. <comment115448> This is very comprehensive and I really appreciate it. I'd have voted up this answer, but I'm two points short of acquiring that privilege. :) <comment357164> What exactly do you mean with "change the permissions on the file so they match (the image)"? I mean, I see two admin users (my admin account and another admin user) with "Read only" privilege and "everyone" with "No Access". I don't see "system" or "wheel" and they're not in the Users & Groups or any other list when I click on the plus button
