Is it possible to use a Nexus tablet as a second monitor for a Macbook Pro? <body> I'm trying to figure out a way to use my Nexus 7 tablet as a second screen on my Macbook Pro. I know that some commercial programs exist to help you do that or similar--I've found, for example that Chrome Remote Desktop works pretty well as a free screen mirror.   A creative solution would also be great, for example, is it possible to make OSX think that I have a second display attached, and mirror that virtual display over Chrome Remote Desktop or a similar program?  <comment300142> Do you have any updates on this?  Which exact laptop model and OSX version do you have? <comment300173> iDisplay and Splashtop are options.
