How to lock the keyboard in Mac OS X, but not the screen? <body> I want to prevent users from typing anything on the keyboard, but still show the screen (so usual locking will not help). Unplugging the keyboard is not the answer I'm looking for, what other options do I have?  <answer219503> strongKeyboardCleanTool/strong is a tool which 'locks' the keyboard. It can be enabled or disabled with the mouse.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LkWlE.png" width="560"  <comment265468> I assume that mouse/trackpad should still be working? <comment265469> Yes, mouse and trackpad should work
