Folders in Applications not in sync with Launchpad <body> I created a folder in strong/Applications/strong to move all Games into a folder called Games. strongLaunchpad/strong is not in sync with the folders that I created.   Looking at the folder strongUtilities/strong, I was under the impression that creating a folder in strong/Applications/strong would keep strongLaunchpad/strong in sync .   Is there a way to keep these two distinct Applications (LaunchPad and Finder) which show me a list apps to respect the folders hierarchy ?   <answer24390> The two hierarchies are separate, and cannot be kept in sync without third-party intervention. Even then, there would be difficulties. Note that Launchpad folders have capacity limits that actual folders do not have, and folders within /Applications can contain nested folders, while Launchpad folders cannot.  It's just a coincidence that the apps in /Applications/Utilities match up with the Utilities folder in Launchpad. On my machine, I moved Terminal out of the Utilities folder in Launchpad, but it's still /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app
