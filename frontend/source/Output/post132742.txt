OS X ML being remotely viewed by our tech support <body> Ofcourse in the company you have limited access, there's no way for me to modify such security settings or sharing. But I would like to know aside from knowing that you are being remotely viewed, if there's a way to interrupt this. Any ideas?   <answer132745> That actually does not sound like remote monitoring but a problem with your user account.  Reboot into Single User Mode Restart your computer while holding the Command and S keys, which will drop you to a terminal command prompt. This mode loads you as the "root" user, which gives you full and unrestricted access to every aspect of the system via a command-line interface.  read more how to here  <comment157178> "you are being remotely viewed" with which protocol ? <comment157181> im actually not sure, but it seems like they are using third party stuff. But i noticed the monitor with binocular beside the time and date on my screen and I havent really checked if i could disconnect it. I know it be diffucult to figure this out coz i dont have much information on what software they use, but i wanna know  atleast if theres a way to interrupt them. <comment157183> Yes, their is ways, but it depend on the software they are using, your privileges... We need more infos <comment157184> its really limited. I can only access the keyboard and mouse, it always ask for the administrator password if i try to access other things. So i would want to atleast disconnect them. I am not sure if there's really a way for me to do this. <comment157186> ill try to mess with it tomorrow, and see what I can get and let you know. <comment157187> Have you access to the terminal ? Are you connected by wifi or ethernet ? <comment157190> I am connected to the ethernet, my wifi is disabled. I cant even set that up. <comment157192> yes its a problem with the user account because it doesnt have enough privilege, which is why i cant do any if im being remotely viewed, so i need to know how can i atleast interrup this
