TextEdit El Capitan file-transfer open file text missing <body> I'm trying to get started on a new work machine. Both my old and new machines are running El Capitan. My problem is when I try to move a ".txt" file from one computer to the other, via usb-stick, it keeps coming across blank(missing all text). I get this problem when transferring both directions. I've tried both UTF-8 format and using Automatic formatting. I've tried changing the permissions of the file after the fact, using "Get Info". None of this has given me any success.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks  <answer261898> it was a formatting issue  I changed the USB drive format from GUID to Apple Partition Map.  It seemed to fix the problem
