Where do Adobe AIR applications cache video files? <body> I have various emplayers/em that play videos from websites, I want to know where those videos are cached. Because it's AIR, I suppose it's caching in a particular place, but I can't find it.  <answer35847> In Mac OS X, all applications store theire cache files in one place:     /Users/yourusername/Library/Caches   There you can find the Adobe caches, and Adobe Air cache files.  <comment40867> By all you mean absolutely all ? do all AIR app use the same "AIR" folder or their own, like other apps ? <comment40869> I misunderstand your question: All Apps use their own folders. But they are all in the "Caches-Folder" in Mac OS X.
