What's the difference between "transmit rate" and "link speed"? <body> On my MacBook Pro, System Information (or codeairport/code or option-clicking on the wifi status icon) reports a "transmit rate" of 176  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L5FyL.png" width="180"  while Networt Utility reports a "link speed" of 289  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jXfCU.png" width="180"  What's the difference between these two parameters?  <answer143739> You already see the answer in your screen shot.  The maximum possible rate is 289.  The current transmit rate is 176.  <comment169295> Don't say its 113. <comment169306> That's funny :) you get a + point from me for that. <comment169310> Doh! I see! How did I miss that! <comment169311> Sorry, please post that as your next question :)
