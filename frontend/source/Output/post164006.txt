Sandvox: Only reachable within local network <body> I have several Mac Minis using several OS (10.7.2-Intel Core 2 Duo, 10.8.5-Intel Core i5, 10.5.8-Power PC, 10.9.5-Intel Core i5, 10.6.8-Intel Core 2 Duo). I am using serving pages from all and built the sites using Sandvox. Until a couple of weeks ago everything was running fine. Also using DynDNS. Recently i modified some info on several and now Sandvox replies:  Only reachable within local network  Every pertinent port in the router is open… internally the page is webserved…   help!  thank you for your time and knowledge  <answer164625> Hello… It was the DynDns software… reinstalled and almost everything is good now… only some bugs now  <comment192164> So what kind of info did you actually modify? You just withhold the most interesting part of your question... <comment192168> Indeed! the bottom line is i don't know… the G4 mini macs have not had updates in a looong time… the intel ones have had regular updates… so i really cant pin point it… some security updates. <comment192171> DynDNS changed some parameters… but what does that have to do with the webserver in the mac? (genuine question by the way) its just wierd… thank you for your time
