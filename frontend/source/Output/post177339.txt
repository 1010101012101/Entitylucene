Why are .docx files shown as blank paper instead of blue Word icon? <body> I want to know if I can change this behaviour. code.doc/code files are shown in the usual Word icon, as well as code.dot/code and .dotx files. .dot files. Only the code.docx/code files are shown as blank paper. I have attached a picture for better understanding. I use Microsoft Office for Mac 2011. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WTl0n.png" alt=".docx blank paper"  Output of code/S*/L*/F*/C*/V*/A/F*/L*/V*/A/S*/lsregister -dump | grep -B 7 '.docx' /code in Terminal:  precodetype    id:            27704         uti:           org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         description:   Office Open XML word processing document         flags:         imported  active  core  apple-internal  trusted           icon:                   conforms to:   org.openxmlformats.openxml, public.composite-content         tags:          .docx, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document --     claim   id:            44308         name:          Microsoft Word Document         rank:          Default         reqCaps:               roles:         Editor           flags:         relative-icon-path  doc-type           icon:          Contents/Resources/document.icns         bindings:      .docx --     --------------------------------------------------------     type    id:            46096         uti:           com.microsoft.word.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         description:   Microsoft Word Open XML word processing document         flags:         exported  inactive  untrusted           icon:          Contents/Resources/WXBN.icns         conforms to:   org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         tags:          .docx, 'WXBN' --     --------------------------------------------------------     type    id:            46492         uti:           org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         description:   Office Open XML word processing document         flags:         imported  inactive  untrusted           icon:                   conforms to:   org.openxmlformats.openxml, public.composite-content         tags:          .docx --     claim   id:            110308         name:          Microsoft Word Document         rank:          Default         reqCaps:               roles:         Editor           flags:         relative-icon-path  doc-type           icon:          Contents/Resources/document.icns         bindings:      .docx --     claim   id:            110668         name:          Microsoft Word XML Document         rank:          Default         reqCaps:               roles:         Editor           flags:         relative-icon-path  doc-type           icon:          Contents/Resources/document.icns         bindings:      .docxml --     --------------------------------------------------------     type    id:            61848         uti:           com.microsoft.word.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         description:   Microsoft Word Open XML word processing document         flags:         exported  active  trusted           icon:          Contents/Resources/WXBN.icns         conforms to:   org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         tags:          .docx, 'WXBN' --     --------------------------------------------------------     type    id:            62244         uti:           org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document         description:   Office Open XML word processing document         flags:         imported  inactive  trusted           icon:                   conforms to:   org.openxmlformats.openxml, public.composite-content         tags:          .docx /code/pre  <comment209769> The icon show correct on my system so I'm wondering whether or not it's properly registered on your system.  What is the output of the following command in Terminal: `/S*/L*/F*/C*/V*/A/F*/L*/V*/A/S*/lsregister -dump | grep -B 7 '.docx'`  Does the information look right and is there at least one line that shows: `icon: Contents/Resources/WXBN.icns` <comment209806> The output looks right and there is such a line. <comment209821> There are some differences between our output of the command I asked you to run so in **Finder** select a **filename.docx** document and press **Command**-**I**.  In the **filename.docx Info** sheet under **Open with:** confirm it says **Microsoft Word (default)**.   Additional differences, I have 4 sections of output to your 8 and I do not have `Contents/Resources/document.icns` or `untrusted` in any output.  As a matter of fact the `Contents/Resources/document.icns` doesn't exist where `Contents/Resources/WXBN.icns` does in the `Microsoft Word.app` bundle. <comment209823> Have a look at my [lsregister output for .docx](http://pastebin.com/9DbRfTEF). <comment209915> When I select a **filename.docx** and press **Command-I**, under **Open with:** there it says **Microsoft Word (default)**. I have no idea about my additional 4 sections. <comment209921> What I put at pastebin is what it looks like as it's installed so what's different with yours I have to assume has come about by some action(s) you've taken, even if unbeknownst to you,  although what I'm not sure.  The `lsregister` program can be used unregister/register entries in the Launch Services Database or even reset it to clear this up. However the next few days I just do not have the time to post an answer with tested examples to ensure what I post works as intended. <comment209926> It's ok. Don't bother yourself too much with this problem. I was just curious if other people had the same behaviour.
