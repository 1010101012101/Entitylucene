Downgrade from Xcode 6.1 to Xcode 5.1.1 <body> I just accidentally updated Xcode to 6.0.1 (don't ask me how these things happen).  I'd like to downgrade - is there any clear path for that?  <answer147229> I ended up downloading from the developer site and trashing the old version. This seems to work.   <comment173585> Try copying it back in from a backup - compress the new version by right clicking on it then choosing compress - then delete the uncompressed app - then copy the older version into applications folder from your backup. If you don't have a backup I have no suggestions.
