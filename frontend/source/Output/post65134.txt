Debugging Server connection interrupted messages <body> I'm suffering at irregular intervals on my network with:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNZXZ.jpg" alt="Time capsule series 1"  Does anyone have some practical advice how to limit this? I don't understand what the problem is. The new Macbook Air with Mountain Lion has no problem pinging 192.168.1.2 (the Time Capsule) on my home network.  <answer74142> I had the same problem and wrote this post with the answer:  The fix is to remove/disable code/System/Library/LoginPlugins/FSDisconnect.loginPlugin/code  The following steps should sort you out:  ol liClick on the spotlight icon (magnifying glass) in the upper right of your screen/li liType in ‘terminal’/li liClick the ‘Terminal’ icon (black with white border) under applications/li liType in the following command (and hit enter):  codesudo mv /System/Library/LoginPlugins/FSDisconnect.loginPlugin /System//code/li liIt will prompt you for your user password. Type it and hit enter again/li liReboot/li /ol  This just moves the plugin to code/System/code so you can restore it again if needed by replacing step #4 with codesudo mv /System/FSDisconnect.loginPlugin /System/Library/LoginPlugins//code.  <comment86129> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
