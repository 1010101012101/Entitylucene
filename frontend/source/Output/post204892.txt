OS X 10.10.5 Preview App <body> Highlight drop down menu is greyed out on OS X 10.10.5 in my preview.app.   I understand that's where the Alpha tool is? Suggestions please for gaining access to that menu command?  <answer204895> Are you looking for Instant Alpha?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWOVG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just go to strongView/strong â†’ strongShow Markup Toolbar/strong (kbdSHIFT/kbd + kbdCMD/kbd + kbdA/kbd) and select it.  <comment247050> Exactly. When I go into "Adjust Color" I don't see the Instant Alpha tool....just exposures, hues, etc. <comment247059> I showed you the screenshot of the markup toolbar where the icon is located, please accept the answer since it solved your question. <comment247062> I just figured it out. It is an icon 2nd from the left in Markup. <comment247068> Very odd...you changed the screen shot and edited your answer. You clearly told me to go into "Adjust Color," and I'm the one who told you it was in markup. <comment247083> The picture was there all along, the markup toolbar can be invoked with Adjust Color as well but I edited the answer to Show Markup Toolbar instead since it's the more logical solution. <comment247091> Untrue. I looked very carefully at it. It was definitely not there. <comment247189> A moderator can easily confirm the pic was there, don't be evil. I spent time helping you, my answer is valid even without the pic. You should strive to be constructive, accusing me of lying on a help site is low.
