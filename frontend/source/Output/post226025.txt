Mac App Store Character Set error! <body> I'm having trouble with the Mac App Store. It shows me error messages with question marks instead of normal letters as in the following pic.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XQE4P.png" alt="mac app store message"  Can anyone help me?   <answer226042> Best guess is font corruption at OS-level  Reinstall your current OS's latest combo updater - find it here &amp; refine the search at top left for your actual current OS.  <answer226064> Go to the Applications folder and start up the Font Book app and do File  Restore Standard Fonts and restart.  If that doesn't work, try a Safe Boot.  <comment274455> What version of OS X are you talking about?
