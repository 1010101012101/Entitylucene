Safari restored a private browsing session after my Mac crashed <body> I know where Safari keeps cache information, but my computer froze, and I had to reboot it forcibly.   Prior to the freeze, I was using Safari with private browsing enabled (i.e. I was using a private window). However, after the reboot Safari completely restored the previous session. I did not expect this as I had been using it in private mode.  strongWhere is Safari storing this information?/strong  I am also wondering if it is safe to delete code~/Library/Safari/code?   My bookmarks are in iCloud, and I don't know if I can assume that directory is a privacy concern.  <comment366473> Interesting question. Hope we find out more.
