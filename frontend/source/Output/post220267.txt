Windows 10 on Macbook Pro - Video Driver Repeatedly Crashing after Windows 1511 Update <body> The title says it all.  After a recent update of Windows was pushed through, reporting itself as version 1511, the screen will freeze for a moment, followed by a chirp Windows reports that the drive had stopped responding and reset itself.   This is most pronounced when watching youtube videos. The video playback along with the browser itself will freeze. Closing and reopening the window, and in some casts refreshing the webpage forces the reset of the driver.  So far there have been no lasting side effects beyond the annoyance of frequently having to restart videos.   There have been no recent installations of software before the Windows update, and the only change since the Windows update was the 43.01 update of Firefox.  Any thoughts?  <comment266581> It's a Windows issue really, not a Mac one, but try setting PhysX to CPU, if that's an NVidia machine <comment266583> Can you elaborate? I've only had the Macbook about three months, and outside of setting up Windows 10 using Boot Camp, I haven't had much time to learn the in's and out's of either. <comment266585> I don't own an NVidia-based Mac, but it's a symptom I've heard happens a lot on Windows + NVidia. Cures include forcing YouTube to not use hardware acceleration & stopping PhysX from using GPUâ€¦ but I don't actually know how to achieve these myself - hence I can't post an Answer, just give you something to Google...
