Strange keyboard shortcuts and menu items <body> I have just noticed that some items in the click-right menu and in the keyboard shortcuts settings are displayed in a different language now (Portuguese). The system default language is English and the OS is 10.6.8.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnqbI.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k4zi5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Why is this happening and how do I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MowGQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8kqDp.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DvrIa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer53641> If you installed a Services plugin or a new app that provides services, it's probably that the app doesn't include English-language resources, or said resources got removed. Portuguese would be chosen as the display language if it's the topmost item in the list in codeSystem Preferences -&gt; Language &amp; Text -&gt; Language tab/code that the app has resources for.  <answer53642> This kind of localization glitch can often be fixed by going to system preferences/language &amp; text/language and using the Edit button to uncheck the box for the offending language and then restarting.  Reports of this issue are not uncommon in the Apple forums.  <comment61360> Can you redo the second screenshot but scroll up a bit to show the group title (like General)? You seem to have installed an extension but it's difficult to guess which one. <comment61361> @patrix See the new screenshots that I’ve added. <comment61365> And how do I find the said app? Because I have no idea which one might be, and I don’t recall installing anything in a different language. <comment61366> Hmm, these seem to be standard services (I have them here as well), it's just that OS X seems confused about the system language for some of them. Strange indeed <comment61370> @Alex As patrix mentioned, they seem to be system services. Have you run anything like Monolingual recently? <comment61398> That did the trick, indeed. Thanks! <comment61418> No, nothing that I can remember of. However, see Tom’s answer—his solution worked for me.
