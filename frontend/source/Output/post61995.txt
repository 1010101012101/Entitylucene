Lost Launchpad configuration <body> If I move an app in Launchpad and then I "killall Dock" from the terminal, the Launchpad sometimes gets its previous configuration so my changes are lost. How can I restart the Dock without losing the Launchpad configuration?  <answer62007> Something like codeosascript -e 'quit app "Dock"'/code might work. If not, you could also quit and reopen Dock by logging out and back in.  <comment71589> Why do you restart Dock after changing the Launchpad configuration? <comment71590> I'm a developer and I'm wondering what to do if an user restarts the Dock (losing the Launchpad configuration) <comment71593> Though it’s pretty unlikely that a normal user would restart Dock randomly, you should know that Launchpad configuration isn’t written to disk as soon as changes are made. They are written to disk at certain intervals. <comment71596> Can I force those changes to be written to disk? <comment71597> To answer that I would like to know something. How exactly are you modifying the Launchpad? <comment71599> Manually, normal things a "standard" user would do. <comment71600> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/4623/discussion-between-deepanshu-utkarsh-and-egon1984) <comment71681> Yes, it should work since the Dock is not killed but properly stopped. I'll try that, thank you <comment75706> Lion or Mountain Lion for OS X?
