Securely running unknown apps in macOS <body> I asked for a *nix way to run unknown apps and scripts on Unix.SE. I want it on macOS as well.  Apart from virtual machines and restricted users, I've been advised to use namespaces via codebubblewrap/code. However, codebubblewrap/code does not support macOS.  On Apple.SE, I found the question about sandboxes (and another closed one). So codesandbox-exec/code looks like a way to go.  Still, are there other ways to execute potentially dangerous scripts safely in macOS? And if not, what's the right way to set up restricted users and sandboxes?  <comment370458> What about just running a VM with no sensitive data inside? Example: [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/ca/) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install macOS inside the VM? The script would still be able to use system drivers, but wouldnâ€™t affect anything outside of the file it has access to.
