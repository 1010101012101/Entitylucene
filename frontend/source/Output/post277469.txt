Is iTunes uploading my music to the "cloud"? <body> I notice that in my iTunes there is a blue cloud icon next to some of my music, for example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ETdGt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does this mean Apple is uploading my personal music to "the cloud"? (Normally I load music only via CD-ROMs that I have bought). If so, how can I stop it from doing that?  <answer277481> No, it means that song is available for download emfrom/em the "cloud" to your local drive: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203564
