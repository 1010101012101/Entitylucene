Is there a way to sync iCloud data with a Nokia phone? <body> I am using iCloud but I also have a Nokia phone that I use for emergencies. Apparently it has a calendar and an address book built-in.  Is there a way, using some software to sync the Nokia phone with iCloud via PC or mac?  <answer68331> The only way to sync a non-Apple device with iCloud is to sync your Mac with iCloud, then sync you may with the device using iSync.  <comment57576> The only way I manage this is 1) Sync iCloud with my Mac 2) Use iSync from OSX 10.6 to sync my Mac with my Nokia <comment57582> So I need iSync to use the Nokia desktop software (on a Mac)? <comment57587> I don't use Nokia desktop software. Instead I use an [iSync plugin](http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/isync/compatibility-and-download) developed by Nokia for my specific phone model. In case you have not saved a backup of iSync from Snow Lepard, you can download it [here](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/9355/apple-isync). <comment57588> As you will understand, this does sync with iCloud, but not independently from you Mac. <comment57595> Of course. I only need my Nokia phone to be somewhat up-to-date. <comment79383> MobileMe was leagues better... <comment79384> MobileMe was designed for different purposes. It was also plagued with many problems. When iCloud gets replaced in another 5-10 years, we'll be wishing we had iCloud back. <comment79401> Yeah. One of the "different purposes" was interoperability. Now Apple switched to "contain customers" mode.
