Replace Apple RAID with larger disks <body> I have a pair of 500 GB disks that are mirrored in a Mac. I want to replace them with a pair of 4 TB disks.  Would the following process work?  ul liTurn power off./li liRemove one of the small pair./li liReplace it with a 4 TB drive. RAID will appear degraded./li liUsing Disk Utility add the new drive to the RAID./li liAllow it to rebuild./li liGo have serious coffee.  /li liShut down computer./li liReplace 2nd small drive./li liBoot the computer, rebuild the raid./li liAt this point I emthink/em I should have a RAID with a 500 GB partition and 3.5 TB of free space./li liGrow the file system to fill the disk./li /ul  Will this work?  Am I missing any details?  Uncertainties:  ul liCan Disk Utility or diskutil expand a RAID file system that doesn't fill the disk?/li /ul  <comment330561> I'm fairly sure this won't work. I don't have a Mac with Apple RAID'ed disks in front of me, but I think Disk Utility can't expand RAID partitions. It would be much easier to find a external 500GB drive to copy to and from. This would likely be quicker too. Rebuilding those RAIDs takes ages.
