Problem starting Preview from the command line <body> Some of the time, when I start Preview from the command line, it fails to start normally.  So for instance I will say "open myfile.jpg", and it appears to be trying to start Preview, but the icon for Preview starts bouncing in the Dock and never stops.  If I do a kbdCtrl/kbdkbdC/kbd, and then try again, it will open, but usually the window will not be in the foreground.  Other times, Preview runs just fine from the command-line.  Is there a sure-fire way to run Preview from the command line that does not result in any problems?  <comment35146> You may want to [repair permissions](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1452)
