How to restore Yosemite finder sidebar icons after changing folders with symlinks <body> After I installed on my mac a second drive I figured out it was a good idea to use the old HD for storage. So I symlinked code~/Downloads/code, code~/Documents/code, code~/Music/code, code~/Pictures/code and code~/Movies/code in order for them to be actually located in the old HD, while I'm using the new SSD as a startup disk. Everything works emremarkably/em ok, except, now the icons in the finder sidebar for those folders are the default ones:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOjtl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Even though in the finder preference the icons are ok:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t6Zo2.png" alt="enter image description here"  I already tried this answer but I was only able to restore both the actual folder icons, but not the icons in the sidebar!  <answer176155> It might be the case that, unfortunately, you can't do this.  See this answer: How come Dropbox gets an icon in Finder sidebar?  and this one: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8380562/adding-buttons-to-finder-toolbar  <comment190268> did you try to - Select on of the folders and hit Command + I. Go to the top left corner where there is an icon and select it and hit delete. This should delete the old icon and will be replaced with the new one. <comment190965> Yes, just tried but it restores the general blank folder icon.
