Why do my hidden photos still show up in the Albums? <body> I have a bunch of photos that I have hidden, but I can still see them in my albums. Is there a way to hide them totally?  <answer181666> You can delete it! Hide works only for moments, so in moments hidden photos won't appear  <comment216158> Thank you XD. It is a bit disappointing, Iphoto did not work this way. :_( <comment216162> Ye I know, the new photos app work as iPhone photos app... <comment322964> yeah, completely defeats the purpose of hiding photos :/
