Add calendar event after certain event? <body> If I have a few 'Today is C' scattered around my calendar randomly, is there any way I can add an iCal event after on all the days that contain an event title 'Today is C'?  Quite confusing, but this is what I have in a nut shell  precode| 9/2/12 Today is C| | 9/6/12 Today is C| | 9/7/12 Today is C| |12/5/12 Today is C| /code/pre  But I want this to happen automatically:  precode| 9/2/12 Today is C| | 9/2/12 GOOD| | 9/6/12 Today is C| | 9/6/12 GOOD| | 9/7/12 Today is C| | 12/7/12 GOOD| |12/5/12 Today is C| /code/pre  <comment119129> Did you try anything your self? Like Automator ? <comment119133> @Buscarì›ƒ Yes. I could get it to work if Automator would supply the event date to the Create new Event object
