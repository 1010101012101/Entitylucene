Wise Way To Boot Into Windows With Bluetooth Keyboard? <body> I'm a luddite and have a hardwired keyboard on my iMac. Booting into Windows is never a problem. A family member has an iMac with a Bluetooth keyboard and a Mighty Mouse. Never having used these, I find booting into Windows to be troublesome.  If someone has a slick trick for keeping the keyboard awake so that simply holding down the option key works, that would be excellent. Thanks in advance for any helpful replies.  <answer71745> If you can't access the boot menu at startup, you can always select which OS to reboot into from within OS X or Windows.  In OS X, just go to strongStartup Disk/strong in System Preferences, and select your Windows partition, then restart.  In Windows, you need the Bootcamp tools installed (but they should have been already). You should see strongStartup Disk/strong in Control Panel, which allows you to do the same thing.  <answer83580> I use a program called QuickBoot which gives me a menu to select an OS and reboot. I haven't found a good way to get the alt and keyboard to work, but this is about as good.  <answer83581> Wait until the Mac just finishes playing its power-on self test, (or POST) chime, emthen/em immediately press and hold down down the Option key. Holding the Option key down as soon as you reboot, embut before the chime,/em will not work. Failing this, only a wired keyboard will work.  <answer154255> In the end, I simply purchased a wired keyboard. Should have gotten that at the start.  <comment83314> This is **not** a good solution. The whole point of Bootcamp is booting into Windows occasionally, not by default. I want to encourage this family member to use the Mac OS, not remain as a Windows user who tries the Mac OS once in a great while. <comment83317> Well, doing it this way, it would only be set as the default for as long as you're in Windows. Once you reboot back to OS X, it's reset. But I suppose if the computer is turned off regularly it might be a hassle. <comment96219> What precisely is troublesome? Not being able to get to the boot picker and over-ride the default selection? Not having drivers once booted into Windows? <comment108976> Tried your suggestion, but it did not work. <comment108977> You can't boot into Windows. For some reason, holding down the option key doesn't work. I've tried variations: repeatedly pressing the option key, clicking the mouse to "wake" the Bluetooth connection, pressing the power button on the keyboard to "wake" it up while holding the option key down.
