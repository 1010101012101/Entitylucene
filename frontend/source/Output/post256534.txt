Struggling with Subroutines <body> I'm having, I think, a subroutine problem. I want to use this 'Choose from list' system to order newly acquired music. After dropping on a bunch of mp3s, it should play the mp3 (so I can decide on the genre), then display the first 'choose from...' dialog, which should then lead on to the next one, until it reaches the one which prompts Finder to file the mp3. Then it should move onto the next mp3. But for some reason it merely plays the mp3.   Can anyone help? Apologies for the mass of code but I thought it might be helpful. Maybe I've overcomplicated this... But I guess I'm asking is it possible to go from one 'choose list' subroutine to another before hopping back to the next file in the list?

I'll leave it here for anyone also trying to sort their files using a similar system. When it's up and running, it's a lot faster than manually clicking and looking for folders to sort things into.  precode   --opens the dropped files on open these_items  --these_items are the dropped ones     repeat with i from 1 to the count of these_items         set this_item to item i of these_items         process_item(this_item)     end repeat end open  on process_item(this_item)     -- NOTE that the variable this_item is a file reference in alias format      --plays song so you can make a judgement     tell application "iTunes"         play this_item     end tell     --displays info of item to help decide genre     tell application "Finder"         set selectedItem to this_item         set infoList to {}         copy ("Displayed Name: " &amp; displayed name of selectedItem) to end of infoList     end tell     set {od, AppleScript's text item delimiters} to {AppleScript's text item delimiters, return}     set infoAsString to infoList as string     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to od     set the clipboard to infoAsString     tell me to activate     display dialog infoAsString giving up after 3.5     --moves item     tell application "Finder"         set defaultFolder to alias "Macintosh HD:Users:Tardy:Tardy Stuff:Scripts &amp; Automator Actions:Music Pre-Filing System"     end tell     tell application "Finder"         choose folder default location (defaultFolder) with prompt "What genre?"         set theDestination to result         move this_item to theDestination     end tell   --stops music when sorting is complete     tell application "iTunes"         stop     end tell end process_item /code/pre  Thanks for anyone who was working on a reply.  Tardy  <comment320033> what happens if you comment out the play routine, so it goes straight to 'filing' ? <comment320050> OK, just did that Tetsujin: Same thing happens. What it does, is it opens the same choose dialog - the first one - twice, then seems to quit out, even if five files were dropped onto the droplet.
