How to install Scala on Mac OS X with MacPorts? <body> I'm trying to install Scala following the advice at the official website:  precodesudo port install scala /code/pre  But this gives me:  precode---&gt;  Fetching archive for scala ---&gt;  Attempting to fetch scala-2.7.7_2.darwin_10.x86_64.tbz2 from http://packages.macports.org/scala ---&gt;  Fetching scala ---&gt;  Verifying checksum(s) for scala ---&gt;  Extracting scala ---&gt;  Configuring scala Error: Please use one of the numbered scala* ports instead. Error: Target org.macports.configure returned: obsolete port Log for scala is at: /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_lang_scala/scala/main.log Error: Status 1 encountered during processing. To report a bug, see &lt;http://guide.macports.org/#project.tickets&gt; /code/pre  I'm completely new to both MacPorts and Scala, and don't know what "Please use one of the numbered scala* ports instead" means. strongWhat command should I use then?/strong  I'm not too picky about the Scala version, but of course I'd prefer the latest stable one (currently 2.9.1).  NB: I know I could install Scala without MacPorts, but I'd rather use Macports to manage the installation if it's possible without much hassle.  <answer29907> Try installing Scala 2.9  precodesudo port install scala2.9 /code/pre  … or Scala 2.10  precodesudo port install scala2.10 /code/pre  <answer89956> Now, scala29 is obsolete.  You need to install scala 2.9 or scala2.10:  precodesudo port install scala2.9 /code/pre  <answer141231> Your project's SBT config file can be used to download the latest version of Scala -- for the project.  Of course this uses a little extra time for each project you set up, compared to having the latest Scala version installed already.  The advantage is that SBT's repositories are always up to date with Scala releases, unlike Macports.  <answer216139> The first thing you need to do is find the latest available version of codescala/code. It helps to have recently updated your macports tree:  precodesudo port selfupdate /code/pre  Once that is done, codegrep/code for scala-related ports:  precodeport list | grep scala /code/pre  At the time of this writing, here is sample output from that:  precode$ port list | grep scala scala-migrations               @1.0.1          java/scala-migrations scala2.10                      @2.10.5         lang/scala2.10 scala2.10-docs                 @2.10.5         lang/scala2.10 scala2.11                      @2.11.7         lang/scala2.11 scala2.11-docs                 @2.11.7         lang/scala2.11 scala2.7                       @2.7.7          lang/scala2.7 scala2.8                       @2.8.2          lang/scala2.8 scala2.9                       @2.9.3          lang/scala2.9 scala210                       @0.0.2.10.0-M4  lang/scala210 scala27                        @2.7.7          lang/scala27 scala28                        @2.8.2          lang/scala28 scala29                        @2.9.2          lang/scala29 scalapack                      @2.0.2          math/scalapack p5.8-scalar-list-utils         @1.410.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.10-scalar-list-utils        @1.410.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.12-scalar-list-utils        @1.410.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.14-scalar-list-utils        @1.410.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.8-set-scalar                @1.260.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.10-set-scalar               @1.260.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.12-set-scalar               @1.260.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5.14-set-scalar               @1.260.0        perl/p5-graveyard p5-scalar-list-utils           @1.420.0        perl/p5-scalar-list-utils p5.16-scalar-list-utils        @1.420.0        perl/p5-scalar-list-utils p5.18-scalar-list-utils        @1.420.0        perl/p5-scalar-list-utils p5.20-scalar-list-utils        @1.420.0        perl/p5-scalar-list-utils p5.22-scalar-list-utils        @1.420.0        perl/p5-scalar-list-utils p5-scalar-string               @0.2.0          perl/p5-scalar-string p5.16-scalar-string            @0.2.0          perl/p5-scalar-string p5.18-scalar-string            @0.2.0          perl/p5-scalar-string p5.20-scalar-string            @0.2.0          perl/p5-scalar-string p5.22-scalar-string            @0.2.0          perl/p5-scalar-string p5-set-scalar                  @1.290.0        perl/p5-set-scalar p5.16-set-scalar               @1.290.0        perl/p5-set-scalar p5.18-set-scalar               @1.290.0        perl/p5-set-scalar p5.20-set-scalar               @1.290.0        perl/p5-set-scalar p5.22-set-scalar               @1.290.0        perl/p5-set-scalar scala_select                   @0.1            sysutils/scala_select /code/pre  You want to look for the basic scala package with the latest (i.e. largest) version number. In this case codescala2.11/code. You can also look here, but the list is a little harder to digest. Once you've selected your package, install it like so:  precodesudo port install scala2.11 /code/pre  After running this you can confirm it installed with this:  precodels -la /opt/local/bin/ | grep scala /code/pre  For instance:  precode$ ls -la /opt/local/bin/ | grep scala lrwxr-xr-x   1 root admin     27 Nov 17 10:54 fsc-2.11 -&gt; ../share/scala-2.11/bin/fsc lrwxr-xr-x   1 root admin     29 Nov 17 10:54 scala-2.11 -&gt; ../share/scala-2.11/bin/scala lrwxr-xr-x   1 root admin     30 Nov 17 10:54 scalac-2.11 -&gt; ../share/scala-2.11/bin/scalac lrwxr-xr-x   1 root admin     32 Nov 17 10:54 scaladoc-2.11 -&gt; ../share/scala-2.11/bin/scaladoc lrwxr-xr-x   1 root admin     30 Nov 17 10:54 scalap-2.11 -&gt; ../share/scala-2.11/bin/scalap /code/pre  Now you're most of the way there. The last thing you want to do is codeselect/code the current version of codescala/code. Currently no version is selected and you can show this with the following command:  precode$ sudo port select --list scala Available versions for scala:     none (active)     scala2.11 /code/pre  This says that codescala2.11/code is installed but no version is selected. To select a version run this (though you want to substitute in the version you actually installed):  precode$ sudo port select --set scala scala2.11 Selecting 'scala2.11' for 'scala' succeeded. 'scala2.11' is now active. /code/pre  And showing it's now selected:  precode$ sudo port select --list scala Available versions for scala:     none     scala2.11 (active) $ which scala /opt/local/bin/scala /code/pre  <comment34322> Yep, that worked smoothly.

There's no need to post another answer for each new version or version change. <comment261145> Update (2015), just for the record: nowadays I'd prefer **[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)** for installing Scala (and other things) on OS X: `brew install scala`
