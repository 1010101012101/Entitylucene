How can I convert MKV files and burn them to DVD? <body> I have a 5+1 theater system(can use USB or DVD) which doesn't support MKV play.   How can I use my Mac to burn the .mkv files into high quality dvds ?   <answer38359> Sounds like you need Toast Titanium. Toast will take individual video files and put them into a DVD player compatible format. It doesn't have many options for the DVD's menus, but it's a quick and easy way to burn video files to DVD. It also has many supported formats.  <answer42004> You could convert the mkv file first with something like Handbrake or iSkysoft's iMedia Converter, then burn it to DVD. Handbrake and iMedia Converter will give you more options for converting than Toast.  <comment123593> Toast will not burn mkv for me (Toast Titanium 11). <comment320398> Convert to what though? Is it enough to convert the video to MPEG-2 and the audio to AC3 and the subtitles to text, or does the .mkv file need to be converted to an entirely different format? [I have a `.mkv` and `Handbrake` only offers to convert it to `.mkv` and `.mp4`.]
