Can I capture Spotlight input and use it in another process? <body> I'd like to capture everything I type into Spotlight and use the text as input for a script, possibly a new instance of a Services workflow.  From that point of course anything is possible; the most trivial case for the workflow script is to simply log its input:  precodeecho "$*" &gt;&gt; /home/myFolder/myLog /code/pre  Notes:  ul liIf there is in fact a system log for Spotlight's queries, this would be interesting information and would not answer my question [completely]./li liI am aware that the Service may have to be spawned for each keystroke, since Spotlight shows new results as you type./li /ul  <comment162700> You can try a basic key logger which also notes the app your typing the command in. Than run a script to extract what you need. <comment162701> Send an email to the NSA, I bet they know what you typed in your spotlight search bar. <comment162704> @CousinCocaine I'm sure they do! They, however, will not help me trigger actions in real time based on my input. Regarding key logger, do you suppose such a program would be a more reliable way to get results? <comment162707> never tried a key logger. listening to Service might indeed be a better idea. No clue how ;)
