How can I view the items in the Spotlight cache? <body> I'd like to view the data spotlight has imported.  Is this possible?    EDIT:  For example I can do this:  precodemdutil -svvv /Volumes/h8rdrive /code/pre  and find out this volume was indexed.    I'd kind of like to find out what's emnot/em indexed though.  <answer95373> mdfind is your friend here.  If you simply wanted a list of every file in your spotlight index you could do:  precodemdfind / /code/pre  You can also get it to provide a count of the files.  precodemdfind -count / /code/pre  On my system this returns 224353 which is a good reason not to run the first command!  <comment7472> Er.  Everything is indexed unless you explicitly tell it not to be.  I think there are instances of external drives not being indexed by default, but I'd have to look it up.  I suppose you could put together some conditions and pass them to find. <comment7473> @Harv - Uh... LOTS of the system stuff is not indexed. <comment7474> @Fake Name - k, great.  Colour me corrected.  And submit a response, then.  :) <comment7483> @Harv Spotlight indexes only "Everything within the scope of your permissions", but won't go to ~/Library/Cache or Preferences by default unless you activate "Other" in the config. Also, /System and such are *not* indexed. As for the OP's question, I'm not sure that there's a "Metadata" editor to read the index for a drive. But others may be more clever and come up with an answer. <comment7763> You can force it to index everything.  Mart√≠n you were correct, it would have been better to use AIDE or tripwire.  It does make a pretty good uninstaller though. <comment35523> By default, Spotlight indexes everything but Finder excludes system files from your searches.  There's a way to change this in a Finder search (there are optional search parameters to include system files and invisible files), or use `mdfind` (e.g. `mdfind -onlyin /System -name .framework`).  It also censors results to include only files you have permissions for; to see everything, search as root with `sudo mdfind`.
