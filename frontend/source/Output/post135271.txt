In an AppleScript, how do I call/reuse a subroutine from another AppleScript? <body> snippet 1a  precodeon removeText(searchText, sourceText) set prevTIDs to text item delimiters of AppleScript set text item delimiters of AppleScript to searchText set sourceText to text items of sourceText  set text item delimiters of AppleScript to "" set sourceText to "" &amp; sourceText set text item delimiters of AppleScript to prevTIDs  return sourceText end removeText /code/pre  snippet 2a  precodeon removeText(searchText, sourceText) set prevTIDs to text item delimiters of AppleScript set text item delimiters of AppleScript to searchText set sourceText to text items of sourceText  set text item delimiters of AppleScript to "" set sourceText to "" &amp; sourceText set text item delimiters of AppleScript to prevTIDs  return sourceText end removeText  set theSentence to "I love Windows and I will always love Windows." set theSentence to removeText("Windows", theSentence) /code/pre  I found this subroutine (snippet 1a) is handy in snippet 2a and want to reuse it by calling its name. I googled for howto. Then I saved snippet 1a as code/Users/henry/Library/Script\ Libraries/text.scpt/code and in snippet 2a I replaced  snippet 1b  precodeon removeText(searchText, sourceText) set prevTIDs to text item delimiters of AppleScript set text item delimiters of AppleScript to searchText set sourceText to text items of sourceText  set text item delimiters of AppleScript to "" set sourceText to "" &amp; sourceText set text item delimiters of AppleScript to prevTIDs  return sourceText end removeText /code/pre  with  snippet 3  precodeuse script "text" /code/pre  and got strongsnippet 2b/strong and then I ran snippet 2b, but I got an error saying code«script» doesn’t understand the “removeText” message./code  Reference: "use statement" (refer to the part found by searching codeuse script "Happy Fun Ball"/code in https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/reference/ASLR_control_statements.html)  So I went back to google and found one suggesting I should save snippet 1a as "a script application".  Reference 2: at the bottom of https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/conceptual/ASLR_about_handlers.html  In that one's example, it's  snippet 4  precodetell application "NonStayOpen" launch stringTest("Some example text.") end tell /code/pre  so I exported snippet 1a as code/Users/henry/Library/Script\ Libraries/text.app/code and wrote snippet 2c  strongsnippet 2c/strong  precodetell application "text" launch set theSentence to "I love Windows and I will always love Windows." set theSentence to removeText("Windows", theSentence) end tell /code/pre  Then I ran it and got an error code{} doesn't match the parameters {searchText, sourceText} for removeText./code  Afterwards, I have tried firstly to append coderemoveText(searchText, sourceText)/code to snippet 1a (getting strongsnippet 1c/strong) and exported it to replace code/Users/henry/Library/Script\ Libraries/text.app/code but got an error when running, failed;  secondly to replace coderemoveText(searchText, sourceText)/code with coderemoveText()/code in snippet 1a (getting strongsnippet 1d/strong) and exported it to replace code/Users/henry/Library/Script\ Libraries/text.app/code but got an error when running, failed.  In snippet 2a, how do I call/reuse a subroutine (snippet 1a) from another AppleScript or "script application" (see Reference 2)?  <answer135289> Save this as codetext.scpt/code in Script Libraries folder  precodeon removeText(searchText, sourceText)     set {TID, text item delimiters} to {text item delimiters, searchText}     set sourceText to text items of sourceText     set text item delimiters of AppleScript to ""     set sourceText to sourceText as text     set text item delimiters to TID     return sourceText end removeText /code/pre  Call it like this in another script:  precodeset theSentence to "I love Windows and I will always love Windows." tell script "text" to set theSentence to removeText("Windows", theSentence) /code/pre  <comment160333> Please don't cross post :) If you don't get the response desired from SU, request a moderator migrate it rather than reposting the question yourself. <comment160338> You can get better Applescript help at the mother of all AS sites, http://macscripter.net <comment160342> @Chris Paveglio Thanks! <comment160349> Thank you so much!
