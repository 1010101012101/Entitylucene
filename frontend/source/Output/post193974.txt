How to have more than one app in desktop space? <body> Whenever I click on the maximize/full screen icon on any window, the app window is going to a new Desktop space. But this is kind of distracting because now I am not able to switch apps by doing the kbdCommand/kbd+ kbdtab/kbd shortcut..  so How do I have more than one window in a desktop space..  Lets say I want eclipse,terminal and google chrome in a separate desktop space with the ability to see each app in full screen and the ability to switch between apps by doing the kbdCommand/kbd+ kbdtab/kbd shortcut??  Can somebody help me on this?  <answer194017> I've just tested now and I'm able to do that (multiple full-screen applications and switching between them with kbdCommand/kbd + kbdTab/kbd), but it could very well be because I'm using TotalSpaces, an add-on that greatly improves the usability of Spaces.   Note that with OS X El Capitan and later you need to disable parts of System Integrity Protection (SIP) for it to work.  <comment231293> cannot be done. fullscreen breaks Spaces. I really wish they would fix that. My workaroundâ€¦ never use fullscreen :( <comment342225> It is still actively developed. You just have to (for now) disable system integrity protection - https://blog.binaryage.com/binaryage-moves-ahead/ <comment342665> Thanks. I've updated my answer accordingly - I'm still using it with 10.12 and it works perfectly.
