Print using AirPort Extreme from both OSX and iOS devices <body> Im having two OSX devices and network setup using AirPort Extreme connected to printer with USB. From both of these OSX devices Im able to print wireless and everything works fine for these. However I also have iOS device and from what I understand I can print only using AirPrint in case of iOS. In this guide they say AirPrint printers connected to the USB port of the Apple AirPort Base Station or Time Capsules are not supported with AirPrint. So it means I should disconnect usb printer from the AirPort and connect to wireless network directly, but in that case I would be unable to print from my OSX devices? (I assume this AirPrint functionality is not available in OSX, but Im not sure)  Does this technically mean that you can use Airport Extreme to connect with printer centrally shared for the network but cannot use it for iOS and OSX devices at the same time??  <answer271796> You can use AirPrint printers on macOS. To do this you must plug it in via USB to the wifi router, then on your mac, use System Preferences to add the printer by clicking the little + button. Use the network tool that should find it via Bonjour (a feature built into most devices). This should work for both Mac and PC, as well as iOS.

What you say can be done easily with OSX devices only.. You mentioned this should work as well for iOS, but there is no setup for printer in iOS via Bonjour (or if there is, pls show me). <comment341990> There is an app I used with a non-AirPrint printer -- [Printer Pro](https://appsto.re/ca/hVxCx.i)
