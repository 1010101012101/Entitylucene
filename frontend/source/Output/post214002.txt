Safari searches don't let me go back after clicking a result <body> I'm on Safari 9.0.1. I type searches into the address bar, which directs me to Google's search results page. I click on a result, which takes me to a non-Google page. If I decide it's not what I wanted, I two-finger swipe to go back to the search page. At this point, Safari sometimes (but not always) has forgotten the search page in my history and takes me directly to the default "top sites" page that opens when a new tab opens. Holding the left or right arrows in the tool bar shows the dropdown with the non-Google site I went to and "top sites", but the search results page is now gone. I have to type the query into the search bar again.  Any ideas?
