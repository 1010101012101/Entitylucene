shmmax and shmall values in /etc/sysctl.conf are not loaded on reboot <body> I'm running OSX 10.8.4 and I would like to add a factor of 10 to the default shmmax and shmall values. My code/etc/sysctl.conf/code contains the following settings:  precodekern.sysv.shmmax=41943040 kern.sysv.shmmin=1 kern.sysv.shmmni=32 kern.sysv.shmseg=8 kern.sysv.shmall=10240 /code/pre  However when I reboot and run codesysctl -a | grep kern.sysv.shm/code I see that the values are not being set:  precodekern.sysv.shmmax: 4194304 kern.sysv.shmmin: 1 kern.sysv.shmmni: 32 kern.sysv.shmseg: 8 kern.sysv.shmall: 1024 /code/pre  It seems the only way to be sure these are set is to run sysctl like so:  precodesudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmall=10240 sudo sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=41943040 /code/pre  However I would like to automatically set these values on reboot if possible.  Am I missing some configuration step?  Also - Not sure if this matters, but I have installed postgres via homebrew.  <comment118266> Yeah, I have the same problem. Really inconvenient for development :( <comment122178> Ah, good to know someone else has come across this issue. When I created this post I did not see many other people complaining about it. Still have not found a solution on my end. <comment122720> Yeah, upgrading to PostgreSQL 9.3 renders this point moot, since they changed the memory architecture.
