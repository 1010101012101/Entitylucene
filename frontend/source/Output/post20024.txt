How can I remove the Parallels icons from Launchpad in Lion? <body> I have Parallels Desktop 6 installed and after an upgrade to Lion I got a whole bunch of Windows app icons on Launchpad:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sICWL.png" alt="Parallels icons on Launchpad"  They look ugly and don't have a remove button.br They also don't exist in my strongApplications/strong folder so I can't delete them from there either.  How do I get rid of them?  <answer20026> The original LaunchPad Cleaner would clean up the icons, but running parallels would undo the cleaning. The updated LaunchPad Cleaner V2 corrects that reversion and works to more permanently clean these parallels icons from the LaunchPad view.   Two other workarounds options are also available:  ul liupgrade to the build that supports Lion, as suggested by patrix (free for v6 users);/li lidisable Windows application integration by right-clicking Parallels icon in Dock, selecting strongConfigure.../strong for the running machine and unchecking strongShare Windows applications with Mac/strong in strongApplications/strong section:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7YPw.png" alt="Disabling Windows application integration"  Of course this will also make these shortcuts unavailable on Mac. /li /ul  <answer20027> Launchpad-Control is what you're searching for http://chaosspace.de/dev/launchpad-control-hide-apps-from-launchpad/  <answer20034> I had the same issue initially. After upgrading to the latest version of Parallels (which also solved the virtualization issue), all Windows applications were moved to code~/Applications (Parallels)/code at the first start of Parallels and the icons now don't show up in Launchpad any longer.   <answer22958> I found a way to remove those annoying icons.  Download Launchpad Cleaner2. since it's a tryout it lets you only delete the first page and the default icons, like Safari.br So what I did was gathered all the Parallels icons into 3 folders and name them Safari2, then Launchpad Cleaner took it as default and I was able to delete them.  <answer28899> In your Application directory, there's a folder for virtual machine windows programs (it's hidden, or somehow not easily accesible). You can do a global search for the program name ("internet explorer" i.e), and go to the containing folder. Finally, remove the folder entirely.   <answer37656> I had Windows XP installed using Parallels. I got rid of the Parallels trial as I bought VMWare instead.  In order to clean up my LaunchPad I found that I had to find the following directory: "Windows XP Applications" and delete it.  To find where the directory was I typed into spotlight "internet explorer" without the quotation marks.br NOTE: To open the containing folder of "internet explorer" I held down the Command key and click on "internet explorer".  I then dragged the folder "Windows XP Applications" that was containing "internet explorer" to the Trash Bin.  Then I opened a terminal session and typed the following: rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db sudo killall Dock  That cleaned up my LaunchPad.  Note it took about 10 to 15 seconds to for LaunchPad reindex the correct applications.  Doug  <answer101960> To delete for ever, simply go to codeFinder/code - codeApplications/code - codeMy Bootcamp Applications/code.  Remove all links in there, and Launchpad will automatically remove them.  Normally, the links will still come back if you do a refresh reset, but this method should work.  <comment22110> Thanks, I [have just found it myself](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20024/how-to-remove-parallels-icons-from-launchpad-in-lion/20026#20026). Welcome to AskDifferent! <comment22120> So the upgrade solves the issue? Thanks for letting us know. <comment22126> Unfortunately, this only works the first time but then the icons get restored. <comment33218> I didn't find any hidden folder in /Applications, do you remember the name? <comment33236> i think it's something like "windows xx application". But you just need to do a search in Finder with the win app name, you should see the shortcut in the result list, then right click it and choose "open enclosing folder". <comment33249> You can only disable sharing windows applications with Mac. <comment33250> I have PD 6 and all MS icons are only in this folder. <comment33251> I've stop any sharing between Mac and MS (except folders) after installing PD 7 (full screen mode)
