Frequent WindowServer Crash <body> I've been experiencing WindowServer crashes on my 13" Retina MacBook Pro (early 2013 version, running Sierra 10.12.5) for a while now. It happens at random intervals—sometimes a few days between, sometimes less than 24 hours—and basically just looks like I've suddenly been logged out.  I've googled and googled and found plenty about WindowServer issues in general, but nothing specific to my situation, so I'm hoping someone here, who's more familiar with reading crash logs than I am, might be able to diagnose what specifically is causing the problem.  My most recent crash log can be found here, as it's too long for one post to accommodate: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wCvryaEiUmc4gzPTpyzyLhoGQgyI9eGPA5_CerwLIt4  Thanks in advance for any help!
