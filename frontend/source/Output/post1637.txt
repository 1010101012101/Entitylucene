What do I need to do to sell my iPhone 3GS? <body> I've upgraded my iPhone 3GS to iPhone 4 (and my wife's as well). The new phones came with their own US/AT&amp;T microSIM cards and have been activated. So we still have our old phones with the old SIM cards in them. I've deleted the data off of the old phones, and I would like to sell them.  What do I need to do to sell the old phones? Do I remove the SIM from the phone and expect the buyer to put their own SIM in there? How do they go about getting a legit SIM from AT&amp;T to put in the phone? Or do they use the SIM that is in there? How can I be assured the old phones cannot be linked to my current account in any way?  <answer1638> One easy option, if you can use the store credit, is to sell them to Radio Shack for $200 [1].  If you prefer cold hard cash, or think you can do better than $200, there's a market for them on eBay, and it's easy to search for the going rate.  The phones will be easier to sell for more if you can jailbreak and/or unlock them in advance.  (How to do that is best left for another question.)  As for how a conscientious buyer activates your old phone through the proper channels, it's my understanding that once you've upgraded your line, your old phone can simply be brought into any AT&amp;T store and associated with a new account.  I.e., you can &amp; should sell the phone without a SIM.  Once it's been wiped and no longer has your SIM, the phone is no longer linked to you.

I still would, just to be safe though.  I'm actually looking to buy a 3GS for development. I have a 3G and a 4, but would like that as well. So if you're looking to sell, you can reply to this post lol :-).  <answer1640> Gazelle.com specializes in buying and reselling or recycling old gadgets. They pledge to completely remove any user data.  <answer1641> Nextworth seems to be a neat site for selling old electronics.   http://www.nextworth.com/search/1/q/iphone/?live=1   <comment1449> I wouldn't sell it, before they fix their antenna ;-) <comment1450> I was actually going to put a "no antenna jokes" line in the question... <comment1451> The fetch much more than that on eBay, but that is good to know.  http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?rt=nc&LH_Complete=1&_nkw=iphone%203gs%2032gb&_dmpt=PDA_Accessories&_fln=1&_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&_rdc=1 <comment1452> You should also consider Craigslist. I've heard the demand for used, out-of-contract iPhones is high. <comment1453> I've actually successfully sold all three of my prior iPhones on eBay (one 2G and two 3G's) -- but for me, the time, effort, and trouble isn't worth it for the price premium over Radio Shack's offer.  Especially for items like iPhones, there's a non-trivial risk of fraud on eBay; and even if you're eventually made right, the resolution process can be incredibly painful. <comment1454> It's in pristine condition and I would sell it for $350. Write me at chris@abichandani.com if you are interested. <comment1455> An old SIM may no longer be associated with an active line, but my understanding is that it's not actually deactivated -- specifically, if you stick it in a random phone, it will enable you to dial 911 (which you cannot do without a SIM).  I don't really understand how much information it retains, but the fact that it's functional has always led me to remove them before selling, to be safe. <comment1456> Neat idea. But for a perfect condition 32GB 3Gs with all cables, etc, they will pay only $168.
