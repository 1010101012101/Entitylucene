Want to clean up contacts <body> Years ago I thought I was going to be smart and import 6000 contacts to my database. Several mail systems and mail clients later, I would now like to clean this up down to about the 800-1000 that I actually need.   I can identify the ones to delete because they have an address, but no phone or email.  I am using google apps for business, mail &amp; address book.   I thought if I could just get everything in to a mail client that sorts contacts better, I could sort and manually delete. That would synch accross systems and voila - clean. Problem is I need to look for address with no email or phone number associated in a certain zip code.   I made and archive of my contacts. What I am trying to avoid is exporting all, cleaning in excel, then deleting everything and re-importing all.   Tried thunderbird. no go. tried entourage, but it is not importing all my contacts.   <answer128135> You could use Automator to filter the contacts according to that criteria. I haven't actually tried it, and I'm including a screenshot with some of the conditions I'd use just for reference. But still, this might help.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8INBX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment150098> Automator might be useful in clearing contacts to your criteria
