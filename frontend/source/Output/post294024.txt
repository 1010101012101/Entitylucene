Weird pattern on my MacBook Air top surface <body> After unbagging a MacBook Air on the top panel where the Apple logo is some weird patterns​ were generated. I not sure what are those​ .. can someone explain?  The bag just has some black foam material inside.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3IOax.jpg" alt="some pattern"    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/waPuo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I didn't do any photoshopping. I just used a filter to improve the visibility of the pattern in the pics.  Its opacity is too low and if we rub it gets removed.  <comment371102> This is one of the rare Crop Circle MB Airs.
