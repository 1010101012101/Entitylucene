disk data apparently throttled after five minutes' idle time during reversion (converting (backward)) from Core Storage) <body> With pre-release build 17A264c of 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) and 10.12.5 (Sierra) :   ul liafter five minutes' idle time, the throughput drops to less than 4 MB per second (data written, reported by Activity Monitor). /li /ul  High Sierra:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nw755.png" alt="Activity Monitor alongside the Security &amp; Privacy pane of System Preferences"  Later in the day, Sierra:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8YTP.png" alt="Activity Monitor"  Touching a human input device (HID) – keyboard or trackball, for example – is enough to restore normal throughput, but it's potentially tedious.    h2Questions/h2  h3Is there a technical explanation for the drop after five minutes?/h3  I wonder whether it's an undocumented feature of firmware or Core Storage.   h3What might be done to automatically prevent the drop?/h3  I imagine a periodic script. Maybe every four minutes and fifty seconds.    h2Background/h2  The Energy Saver pane of System Preferences contains nothing relevant.   I thought of ControlPlane. As far as I can tell, its evidence sources can not include idle time.   I experimented with Coca (http://coca.willemkempers.nl/) and Don't Sleep! – not expecting either application to prevent the drop in throughput (because I don't associate the drop with sleep, dimming or screen saving); neither application had the required effect.   iAway can respond to an emaway/em state with an AppleScript, but (above) I have no idea what type of script might effectively end that state.   h3Remotely/h3  With an ssh connection to the Mac I can monitor device I/O, for example:   codeiostat -dIw 5/code  – and re: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/105056/8546 I can measure idle time, for example:   codeioreg -c IOHIDSystem | awk '/HIDIdleTime/{print $NF/1000000000;exit}'/code  – but I have not yet found a way to restore normal throughput after a drop.   h2Environment/h2  MacBookPro8,2   ul libooted from an external hard disk drive, Seagate GoFlext Desk, limited (by the Mac) to USB 2.0/li lino battery/li liwired keyboard and trackball (the integral keyboard and trackpad ceased to work shortly after a repair under the MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues). /li /ul  With the disk limited in that way: normal throughput, during reversion, peaks at around 15.3 MB per second.   precodesh-3.2$ date ;

I edited the question to include drive hardware information, and a shot of System Information. From someone else's https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7846726 for a MacBookPro8,2 at first I assumed that _if_ the integral keyboard and trackpad were found, with this Mac, they would be on the same bus as the built-in FaceTime HD camera. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6809981 makes me assume the opposite so I'll shut down the Mac and put the drive on the other bus. Removal from Core Storage world completed, so it might be a while before I can reproduce the dropping environment.
