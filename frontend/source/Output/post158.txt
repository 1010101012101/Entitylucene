I continue using IMAP for mail, and use Exchange for contacts and calendars. Works great! <comment104> Nice, this one looks like it just works! <comment207> @NReilingh why you think is lacking for mail? <comment324> @gsharp I believe there are issues with syncing saved drafts. Google has this information posted in "known limitations." http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=139635 <comment31135> I find it _curious_ that an iOS feature is called "Google Sync" - it's baked into the OS using a combination of Exchange ActiveSync technology and plain old CalDAV for the rest.
