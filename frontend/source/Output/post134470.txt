Prevent iPhone from charging when plugged into a battery powered MacBook Air <body> I would like to prevent my iPhone draining power from my MacBook Air while the laptop is not plugged in and relying on battery power. How would I do this? Note, there doesn't seem to be any "unpowered USB ports" on the MacBook Air, both of them seem to charge my iPhone even when the laptop is not plugged into a power socket...  <answer134471> Assuming the only other reason that you would connect your iPhone to your MacBook Air other than charging would be syncing. As far as I know there is no way to disable to charging aspect although you can work around it by syncing over WiFi rather than cable. Hope this helps!  <answer180619> I don't know if there is a software way to do that, but there is an hardware way:  ol liUse an unpowered USB cable (some company makes it, targeting audiophiles), might need an adapter to male lightning./li liTape/Remove the power plugs on your USB cable./li /ol  Also, not exactly an answer to your question, but maybe to your use-case: Build a binary, then export it to iTunes, then upload via wifi. No debbuger and much less convenient tho.  <comment159144> Thanks, there's another reason, to test apps you are developing. <comment159161> Oh yeah, surprised I forgot that being a developer myself. Sorry about that.
