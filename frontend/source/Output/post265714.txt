Disable the conversion from "" to “” when typing Chinese <body> Every time I type in a quote mark (code"/code), the "smart" Chinese input method would automatically convert it to code“/code or code”/code for me. But compilers and interpreters don't know what code“”/code mean, they can only recognize code"/code.  How can I disable this conversion?  <answer265717> In most Cocoa-based applications, you can disable this by unchecking Edit  Substitutions  Smart Quotes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9jKfI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer265732> In TextEdit, try invoking caps lock before typing quotes.  <comment333152> @Panda I've tried TextEdit(GUI) and vim(CLI). Both of them have done such conversion. <comment333165> Not sure why, but it doesn't seem to work for Chinese input
