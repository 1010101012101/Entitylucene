Is there a tool that identifies which NSControl is under the cursor? <body> I'm looking for a tool that could help me understand the layout of a closed source Mac OS applications in term of Cocoa controls. I saw this for in Firefox with the 'inspect' feature (for HTML/CSS); I don't expect it to work for every application because of the variety of programming languages and custom classes.   <answer53103> I've not come across anything of this sort, howwever the only solution I could think of would be to view the app's package contents and find the NIB files, of which there can be just a few or hundreds, dependant on the app in question.  Using a tool such as NIB Decompiler (although I've never personally used it) to then view the decompiled NIB within InterfaceBuilder/Xcode.  The project has not been updated in a few years and may not be up to date with the latest version of Xcode.  <answer53105> You can use a usability tool from Apple to see the structure of most user interfaces; try the Apple developer tool Accessibility Inspector. I believe it will do what you need.  The latest Xcode download may not include this tool as standard. You may need to download an additional package to find this tool.  <comment60708> That's interesting. I didn't suspect the NIB files would still be present in the compiled application. <comment60709> I have found a sample application in XCode named UIElementInspector. Its bundle name is "Accessibility inspector" and it fits my needs. <comment70029> I'm sorry but questions relating to programming are off-topic for Ask Different. More information can be found in [our FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questions). This type of question belongs on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow), which is a site specifically for programming. <comment70105> Please edit in your end-user rationale for wanting this answered - since development is off topic here, you may not even get an answer, but that at least would make it on topic for this site.
