Live Photos Metadata <body> I've been trying to transition from Apple Photos to a plain folder tree (and then use dropbox). For this to be useful, one needs a good naming scheme.  I did a bit of googling and using Hazel seems like a good way to do it. Unfortunately, apple photos exports files with the "incorrect" creation date. Thus one needs to recover this from the exif data. I found this script, which can be inserted in Hazel without any problem (https://www.macstories.net/reviews/better-dropbox-camera-uploads-with-camerasync/).  precode&lt;?php date_default_timezone_set("Europe/Rome"); $date = exif_read_data($argv[1],"EXIF"); $date = $date["DateTimeOriginal"]; $time = date_parse_from_format("Y:m:d H:i:s",$date); $time = mktime($time["hour"],$time["minute"],$time["second"],$time["month"],$time["day"],$time["year"]); touch($argv[1],$time,$time); ?&gt; /code/pre  This works almost perfectly, the exception being Live Photos. When I "export unmodified original" I get a jpg and a mov. The script parses the jpg correctly, but assigns a bogus date to the mov file.     How can I modify the script above to get it to work for the mov file of a live photo?   The second answer here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32508375/apple-live-photo-file-format) seems to explain how Photos keeps track of the metadata for the mov file, but I have no idea how to use it.  [I also found this alternative script, which uses exiftool, but still produces an bogus date https://www.noodlesoft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=2218]
