Suddenly can't access Mac Mini <body> I'm posting this from Windows laptop, because I lost access to Mac Mini.  Yesterday, everything was fine. I did not upgrade or update. Though I remember Mac asking if I want to update right now and I pushed it further into future. It was either yesterday or few days before. Don't know if it updated when I shut it down.  Today when activating Mac, following happened: - Tiny power light burns, showing Mac Mini is active. - Philips 223V monitor blinks, showing monitor is active, but there is no connection between Mac and monitor.  After waiting long enough, disconnected power, shut Mac down, pushed CMD+R on keyboard, pushed Mac's power button again.  And nothing. Could not even get Recovery Mode.  So right now, I have NO access to Mac. I see it is working, but it seems to have zero connection with monitor. I can't access Recovery Mode, I can't do a thing.  I have no other monitors to attach there and it is Saturday so local Mac support center is also closed for 2 days.  Any ideas what this could be caused from?  <answer292740> While you're unable to emsee/em what's on the screen at present, you'd still be able to use the keyboard to reset the NVRAM and SMC, so I'd try doing that to see if it has any impact.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  Your Mac mini uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM) to store various settings.
