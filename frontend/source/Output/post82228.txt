How to change some information in a shell prompt. <body> I opened my terminal and saw a shell prompt.  precode Last login: Fri Feb 15 15:28:16 on ttys000  john:~ voloda2$  /code/pre  How do I change john to alex?  <answer82237> Add the following line to the end of your code~/.bashrc/code:  codeexport PS1='\u:\W \$ '/code  Your prompt should now be codevoloda2:~ $/code, which is your username, a colon, the current working directory, and a code$/code if you are a regular user, or a code#/code if you are root. For more prompt customization options, type codeman bash/code or visit here for a full list of options.  If you just want to change codejohn/code to codealex/code, then use codeexport PS1='alex:\W \u \$ '/code. codejohn/code is the name of your computer, so if you have appropriate administrator privileges open System Preferences, select Sharing and change the name to whatever you want, and your prompt will automatically update. However, if you are on a network, at work, or using a shared computer, talk to your local system admin before doing this.   <comment94884> "john" is either the user or the computer name. Why do you want to change it? <comment94885> I do not like John. It is a bad guy. <comment94913> Then it sounds more logical to change your computer- and/or username first.
