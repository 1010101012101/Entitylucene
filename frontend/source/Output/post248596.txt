“You don't have permission to save files in the location where screen shots are stored” <body> Every time I try and take a screenshot this appears ^. I've tried looking for the location of my saved screenshots typing in commands into the terminal and  my Desktop folder is unlocked (in Get Info).   This is what was on my terminal:   I typed: codedefaults read com.apple.screencapture location/code  Result: codeThe domain/default pair of (com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist/code  I typed: codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/code  Result: codeCould not write domain com.apple.screencapture; exiting/code  Please help!   <answer248779> grep "truncating history files" /etc/* 2 /dev/null /etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal:     echo -n 'truncating history files...'  <comment308040> Have you tried fixing permissions in Disk Utility? <comment308049> What is the result of `ls -l ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist`?
