Wrong email given when trying to update apps <body> When trying to update my whatsapp version, the email that is provided when required to input my password is incorrect? I am also unable to change it my correct email??  <answer187243> Seems like the app was bought using a different iTunes account. You can display the buyer informations on your Mac using iTunes:  ol liOpen iTunes/li liNavigate to the "Apps" section/tab in the horizintal navigation menu/li liSearch for "WhatsApp" and select it/li liHit codeâŒ˜ + I/code or right click and select "Information"/li liClick on the "File" tab for the buyer information/li /ol  <comment221249> The app belongs to whoever 'bought' it from the iTunes store [even if it was free] & can only be updated by using that account's credentials.
