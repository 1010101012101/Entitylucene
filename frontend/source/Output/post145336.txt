Apple said we can use iMovie to make App Previews, but I can't export the correct size using iMovie <body> I'm trying to create an App Preview for an iPhone app.  I recorded a screen capture of the app in the native resolution of the phone.  Then I imported the video in iMovie and used iMovie to add transitions and text, and to arrange the clips.  According to Apple, App Previews should be 640x1136 for the iPhone 5 portrait size, but the export menu doesn't support this size or any custom sizes.  Apple said we could use iMovie, but this doesn't seem to work. How can I change the export size?   <answer145337> It may be possible to use some other software to crop and re-encode the output, but that would be a messy and troublesome process.  Instead, the solution I came to is this:  ol liDownload a trial of Final Cut Pro from Apple. /li liExport your movie to Final Cut Pro using these instructions./li /ol  I had some trouble on this step (the menu option was grayed out, initially), but eventually resolved it by making sure all the clips were consolidated in the library.  ol start="3" liIn Final Cut Pro, modify the project settings to use the custom resolution: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/reiNl.png" alt="info tab when your project is selected"/li liFollow Apple's instructions for exporting App Previews with Final Cut Pro./li /ol  I believe Apple made a mistake in recommending iMovie during WWDC. Actually, on the new App Preview documentation, they no longer mention iMovie. Perhaps some day they will update iMovie and add support for other export presets.  In the meantime, I would suggest either buying a Final Cut Pro license or using video editing software other than iMovie.   <answer146126> I've encountered the same surprise. Here's a really easy solution:  From within iMovie:  ol liSelect Share from menu bar/li liChoose 'Export using Quicktime'/li /ol  On 'Save Exported File asâ€¦' screen:  ol liSelect 'OPTIONS' (which is toward the bottom of window beside 'Export: Movie to Quicktime')/li /ol  On 'Movie Settings' window:  ol liSelect Video Settings button/li liBe sure compression type = H.264/li liChange Frame Rate to = 30 fps/li liMake Compressor Quality = Best/li liPress OK to confirm/li /ol  Back on 'Movie Settings window:  ol liSelect 'Size' button under Video section/li liOn 'Export Size Settings' screen now/li liSelect 'Dimensions' drop down/li liScroll to bottom and choose 'CUSTOM'/li liYou'll now have the option to input: 640 x 1136 (for iPhone 5 series dimensions)/li liPress OK, OK, then Save/li /ol  <answer152909> iMovie is able to export app previews. I just went through the process.  One downside to using iMovie for making an app preview is that the selection of titles is much more limited than in a regular movie.  In a couple weeks I will find out whether Apple accepts my preview.  https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/imovie/Creating-App-Previews-with-iMovie.pdf  Update: Apple accepted the iMovie-generated app preview.  <answer153547> Make sure you go to File-New App Preview (available on iMovie 10.0.6 on Yosemite).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKHGR.png" alt="New App Preview"  <answer154416> I'm using iMovie 10.0.6 on Yosemite. With this version there is an option "New App Preview" under the File menu. Just click on that to start creating your app preview.  As Josh Adams mentioned there are less title options but they are specific for app previews which is handy.  I created my app preview and when clicking on the Share button, there is a new icon "App Preview" which will export the file in the required format. I was able to upload the file to iTunes Connect.  <answer169377> iMovie as of today (Jan 2015) only lets you create an app preview export at 1920 x 1080, which while great for the iPhone 6+ is useless for creating all the other sizes and aspect ratios needed. I had to bite the bullet and buy FCPX, this allowed me to export at all the resolutions and easily mod the aspect ratio's of the imported raw video.  <answer175417> strongFor exporting:/strong  Once you have created an App Preview project in iMovie (see kokernutz's answer) and finished your movie, you can export from the share menu as shown in this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hThNx.png" alt="App Preview Share Menu"  For some reason the app preview option only showed up when my focus was on the timeline (in other words, if you don't see it, click somewhere on the timeline for your project first).  You can obviously still use the File export to get the same results if you know the right settings (discussed in some of the other answers).  <answer180304> Here is a trick using just iMovie and Quicktime to get the right dimensions.  ol liUse QuickTime to record a short clip from the size of the device you need/li liUse iMovie and insert that clip into a new "App Preview" project/li liAdd your actual video after the short clip/li /ol  Now, any clips that you export will be in the right dimensions.   If you need to hide your short clip, you can shorten it to 0.1 seconds. Put a title over it and delete the text. Now your video starts with 0.1 seconds of a black screen.   <answer182254> Here is how to do it for stronglow cost and really fast/strong.    ol liRecord just one demo from the iPhone 6 plus.  /li liEdit it in iMovie as an App Preview project./li liExport it as a ProRes file/li /ol  You now have your high quality master from which you will produce all other formats, without having to record more demos on other devices and edit them all over again, which is horribly time consuming.  On the Apple Store buy and download strongQuickTime 7 PRO/strong for just 30 dollars.  This is the seventh marvel in the video world and a very well kept secret: it's cheap and will convert to almost any format! Pro guys know this and use it all the time.  ol liOpen your master in QT 7 Pro./li liSelect "export as..." Set it to MPEG-4 Video and press the "Options..." button./li liUse Apple's "App Preview Specifications" to setup the export parameters. The trick when you export to the iPad Format is to check the "Preserve proportions via Letterbox" option". This will add black bars on each side of your iPhone 6+ videos./li /ol  Use your freed up time to make your app better!  <answer188309> strongSometimes the "Video in wrong format" error has nothing to do with your video or format./strong  It's THEIR server.  I had a video that uploaded fine one day and got the ERROR : "Your app video preview is in the wrong format."  I did everything I could to tweak, check, change, re-export etc etc to fix it - thinking that it was me.  It wasn't.  They have server issues and give an error when there's nothing wrong on your end.  strongHOW IT WORKED FOR ME/strong  ul liLogout of iTunes Connect/li liRelax/li liGo to sleep/li liWake up in the morning, relogin to iTC and try again. IT WORKS!  With the exact same video file in the exact same format!!!/li /ul  My steps were to upload the new video.  Once I see the play button in Safari, I played the video all the way through.  Closed that popup.  Save.  Then submit.  I did get that message that says it could take 24 hrs for video to process but I did not get the format error.  Good luck.  Hope this helps someone.  <answer188358> If like me and the OP you did all of the work to create your preview only to find that you can't 'share' it as a preview because you did not start it as a preview then here is the answer.  Start a 'New App Preview' then open your original project - click in the timeline and select all (cmd + a) - copy that (cmd + C) - go to your empty app preview - click in the timeline and - paste (cmd + V).  All your hard work is now in the app preview video.  <answer188782> Add an image to the beginning of the video, e.g. one second splash screen or 0.1 second black/white screen. Make sure the image dimensions match the intended device dimensions. Video added after the image will conform to these dimensions. Change the initial image dimensions to export to other devices.  <answer263667> I just did this for my App Preview created with iMovie. The solution is simple but iMovie does not make it obvious.  All you need to do is at the very beginning of your movie, add a static image that is the correct resolution that Apple is asking for. Here's a reference to those resolution requirements from Apple.  This will mean creating separate videos for each phone size. Fortunately, across all products there are only 3 screen resolutions (6 total for Portrait &amp; Landscape).  To do this:  ol liOpen iMove/li liSelect strongFile  New App Preview/strong/li liAdd the static image for your strongfirst phone size/strong/li liComplete making your video/li liMake a second video by selecting strongFile  New App Preview/strong/li liAdd the static image for your strongsecond phone size/strong/li liGo back to your first video, select all elements of the video (emexcept the first static image/em) and strongCOPY/strong/li liGo to your second video, and strongPASTE/strong all of those elements after the static image/li /ol  That's it! You can check that the video is being created at the correct resolution by clicking the "Settings" button to the top right of the Video Timeline. There is should give you a tooltip and at the top say "App Preview - [emYOUR VIDEO RESOLUTION/em]"  Hope that helps!  <comment172477> This does not work on the new iMovie. There is no export using Quicktime <comment172487> Can you clarify the version of iMovie where this works? <comment189493> iMovie ON YOSEMITE certainly has the ability to create app previews and they cover that in detail in https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-previews/imovie/Creating-App-Previews-with-iMovie.pdf <comment198614> Apple denied our App Preview submitted with these dimensions.Instead requested the following dimensions: 750 x 1334 So follow the previous protocol for exporting a video from within iMovie, using Quicktime, but make your custom dimensions: 750 x 1334 <comment212918> additionally i think the supported export size is always the same of the first video file added to the project. so if you add screen recorded iphone5 footage you will end up with 640x1136 <comment214094> How did you get the required 1334x750 size? <comment214095> How did you get the required 1334x750 size? <comment217074> The app preview clip I generated had resolution of 1080x1920 and was accepted in iTunesConnect. <comment226604> Excellent answer. <comment230690> Make sure you start clean. I copied and paste the edit from the movie format and I still get 1920 x 1080. But if you edit new straight from App Preview format it will be 900 x 1200. <comment304645> I think this is an advertisement for QuickTime, considering it is (as demonstrated by the first answer) completely unnecessary in order to produce the desired result (and doesn't even change the final result in any way, significant or otherwise). <comment306163> I thinks it's a valid recommendation. I've use QT-7 Pro for many years. It was perfect for assembling my preview without dealing with the "nuances" of iMovie. <comment370492> Works like a charm. Thanks <comment370493> What I did was created a new App Preview project, first added a screenshot which is of the correct dimensions and then added the video exported from the other project (this was intended to be a quick fix).
