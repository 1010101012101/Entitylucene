Setting Default Send-From Address on iPhone <body> If I take a photo using the camera app, and then want to share it by email, the default is to send from my icloud email address. I have my gmail set up on my phone using exchange, and that had always been the default until recently (with all that icloud stuff).  How can I set my gmail address as the default send-from address when sharing a photo?  <answer72397> For setting your default email account on an iOS device do the following:  Go to:  Settings - Mail, Contacts, Calendar - and scroll down to strongDefault account/strong.br (Hope I translated it correctly, but I guess it is clear what I mean)  Set the default account to your likings.  <answer72558> I had to go to Settings - iCloud and then turn off mail.   <comment84259> I actually already had this as the default account, and it didnt work.
