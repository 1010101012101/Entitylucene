How do I force iPhoto to download new photos in my Photo Stream? <body> I'm listing some items for sale online, and have taken a bunch of pictures with my iPhone.  About half-way through the process, iPhoto '11 stopped downloading new photos into its local Photo Stream.  I've quit iPhoto and re-opened it.  I've gone into the Photos app on my iPhone and confirmed all the pictures are there.   Is this normal behavior? Is there any way to tell iPhoto to download my pictures?  <answer33038> strongIn iPhoto, turn Photo Stream off then on./strong  Go to Preferences  Photo Stream.  Uncheck "Enable Photo Stream".  Close the preferences window.  Click Photo Stream in the left-hand navigation pane and confirm there are no photos.  Turn Photo Stream back on in preferences (check "Enable Photo Stream").  After a few seconds, iPhoto will start to download all the photos again.  Depending on the number of photos, and your bandwidth, it may take awhile.  <answer48270> I have found a better way. One that doesn't involve resync'ing the entire stream.  ol liQuit iPhoto/li liOpen up Activity Monitor/li liIn the search field enter: codephotostreamagent/code/li liSelect all the codePhotoStreamAgent/code processes listed/li liClick the codeQuit Process/code button/li liIn the confirmation dialog that pops up click the codeQuit/code button/li liConfirm that all the codePhotoStreamAgent/code processes are no longer alive by waiting for the Activity Monitor window to show no processes with that name/li liRe-start iPhoto/li /ol  When you restart iPhoto it will re-start the codePhotoStreamAgent/code process for your iPhoto session and kick off a new Photo Stream sync. You'll get your lastest pictures updated and you won't have to sit through a full re-sync of all your Photo Stream.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dffLb.jpg" alt="Activity Monitor"  Update for Yosemite where the process name has changed to codeiCloud Photos/code.

And yes, since I have a ALOT of streams it took a long while to download and refresh them all.  <comment38836> Sadly, I've not been able to find a better way to get iPhoto 9.2.1 to refresh it's Photo Stream photos. <comment55772> nice! That saved me a lot of time. <comment116612> No marked answer yet? <comment193247> In OSX Yosemite the process is named iCloud-photo's <comment193299> Thank you @user107243! I've updated the answer to include a Yosemite portion. <comment223253> Actually worked for me too. Thanks! <comment234739> As of OS X Yosemite 10.10.4 (at least) this is now `Photos Agent` with the icon matching the new Photos app. <comment234740> Thanks @ColinM.! I've updated the answer! <comment251266> This is perfect!! I've been looking for a solution like this. By the way, from the command-line you can also issue: `sudo pkill cloudphotosd` or `sudo killall cloudphotosd` <comment251269> @Andrew good tips. Added them to the answer. <comment270086> This method worked for me in Photos 1.3 when restarting it and quitting the Photo Stream processes didn't.  If other people have similar results, this answer might should be edited to reflect that. <comment329428> I hope there's a 2016 question for the same thing for `Photos.app` which has (pointlessly) replaced an excellent iPhoto app.
