Domain forwarding in MacOS Sierra <body> I need codesome.domain.com:8000/code to be linked to code162.251.150.150:80/code.  So when I load codesome.domain.com:8000/code in my browser - an actual request should be going to code162.251.150.150:80/code.  I was trying to use codepf.conf/code for that with different settings, but without success:  precodepass out proto tcp from  some.domain.com port 8000 to 162.251.150.150 port 80 nat pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to some.domain.com port 8000 -&gt; 162.251.150.150 port 80 /code/pre  (I've created an alias for codesome.domain.com/code in hosts file along with that)  I have MacOS code10.12.3/code  p.s. I made that working in Ubuntu with following command:  precodesudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -d some.domain.com  -j DNAT --to-destination 162.251.150.150:80 /code/pre  p.p.s. I saw following question  What is the modern way to do port-forwarding on El Capitan? (forward port 80 to 8080)  My question is specific because of domain name need to be specified  <comment345380> Related and almost duplicate: [Murus firewall - redirect an ip to localhost web server](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/267127/murus-firewall-redirect-an-ip-to-localhost-web-server). If you have questions or don't get this to work make a comment @klanomath here and I will write an answer. <comment345395> @klanomath tried    `rdr pass log on lo0 proto tcp from en1 to 10.0.0.1 port 8000 - 162.251.150.150 port 80`  `pass out on en1 route-to lo0 proto tcp from en1 to 10.0.0.1 port 8000 keep state` with some.domain.com linked to 10.0.0.1 in hosts file - didn't work. Could you please help me? (edited - didn't finish comment) <comment345396> Tried and doesn't work for you? <comment345398> @klanomath sorry, just finished comment, please see above
