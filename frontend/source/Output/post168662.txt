Unknown MacBook Air error <body>    OSX Mavericks, MacAir11   My built-in keyboard suddenly does not work anymore. Even when I did not turn on caps lock it stills capitalize all letters for me. I relogged but does not work. strongAfter testing I found out that the kbdRight Shift/kbd is glitched./strong This makes me unable to enter the password of my Mac correctly and leads to the second problem. I don't know if it's because the keys are malfunctioning or I get infected by a virus.  As I cannot log in into my Mac, I have to log in using the Guest User account. But this happens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1jVb.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GZEul.jpg" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q7NSc.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And it made an infinite loop.

Found out that the keyboard problem and the kernel problem is two different things.  Any suggestions why this is happening, and how can I fix this problem?  <answer169053> Problem solved.     Keyboard   The kbdRight Shift/kbd button is stuck as there is dust.
