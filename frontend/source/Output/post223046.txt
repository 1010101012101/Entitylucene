Prolific PL2303 ceased working <body> On my MacBook Air (running 10.11.2), all my Prolific PL2303 USB-RS232 Adapters (USB VID_067B&amp;PID_2303) ceased working out of the blue, literally over night. I have no idea what caused this.  The adapter shows up when running codeioreg -p IOUSB/code as   precode+-o IOUSBHostDevice@14200000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x10000063a, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (37 ms), retain 11&gt; /code/pre  The devices /dev/tty.usbserial and /dev/cu.usbserial are still created, but codescreen /dev/tty.usbserial/code won't work. screen opens without an error, but I can't do nothing. screen does not react to keystrokes.  I tried these adapters with Windows / Putty and everything works as supposed.  I uninstalled the old drivers by running   precodesudo rm -rf /Library/Extensions/ProlificUsbSerial.kext sudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/*PL2303*.* sudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/*ProlificUSbSerial*.* /code/pre  and installed the latest Prolific driver from http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&amp;pcid=41, but no luck.  codesudo dmesg/code shows      PL-2303/X V1.5.0 start, Prolific   No other errors.  Still, no show.   Any ideas?  <answer223092> I have tried everything myself. The only thing I actually got to work was buying drivers from Mac-serial-USB.com I do believe what the website was. After I loaded the new driver from them. It was like 8$ it worked perfect which made me extremely mad because I shouldn't have to pay some random company for a driver that should already work.   <answer223293> Have you disable the SIP in the recovery? I recently updated to 10.11.2 from 10.11. Previously I had disable it but after update, it was enable again by Apple.  ol liRestart laptop, press command+R to go into recovery./li liOpen 'Terminal' in recovery/li licheck SIP status, type csrutil status/li liif it is enable, then disable it by typing csrutil disable/li lireboot/li /ol  hope it helps.  edit: here's a link to understand SIP protection  http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-security-el-captan-rootless/  <answer223339> OK, given that I'm in a hurry and need to configure some devices I discarded all my Prolific based USB adapters and purchased a couple of FTDI based devices, which work flawlessly with El Capitan.  <comment270496> Did you experience the same symptoms as described above? <comment270753> as stated above, I don't have the problem that the kext doesn't get loaded. In fact, the kernel message quoted above states that there aren't any kext related problems, so I don't know how disabling SIP would do any good. <comment319717> Download the new package [PL2303_MacOSX_1.6.1_20160309.zip](http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&pcid=41)
