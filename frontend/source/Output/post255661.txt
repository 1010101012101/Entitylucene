How to temporarily deactivate certain mail accounts ("fetch mails instead of push in")? <body> I want some email accounts to be on "fetch mode", so that my emails do not fly inside my computer during the times I work on project, where those mails would be disturbing. However, I cannot completely close mail, as I have other mail addresses, with mails, that are important and urgent, because they are connected to those projects.   I have in sum 8 accounts, and I want to disable 5 of them temporarily each time I work on my project, where I only need 3 accounts.   In short project breaks, I would be happy to fetch the emails of the 5 accounts, that I don't want to push in.   Furthermore, I already tried to set them offline, but apparently they go online by their selves and than mails fly in.   <comment318442> Why don't you use two different mail client ? <comment318443> Because I really like mail especially with its nice plug ins - and I just have hoped there is a nice solution for this little problem but well - I could do this if there is no better solution <comment318473> Some mail clients have a lot of great features without plugins ;) You can test Newton, Polymail, Airmail... <comment318615> I don't believe there's a way to switch fetch/push settings on a per-account basis without manually disabling the "Include when automatically checking for new messages" option for each account. @MrMojoRisin +1 for AirMail!
