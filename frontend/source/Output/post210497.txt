root permissions <body> After I installed el Capitan, Little Snitch started complaining about codegamed/code trying to phone home. Research in the net revealed various suggestions, including  ul lilogging out from the Game Centre/li liusing codelaunchctl unload/code/li licodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed Disabled -bool true/code/li liadding code&lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;&lt;true/&gt;/code to gamed's plist/li lirename the codegamed/code image/li lietc./li /ul  OK. I wasn't logged into the Game Centre. codelaunchctl unload/code isn't pervasive across reboots (nor is the cruder codekillall -9 gamed/code). codesudo default write.../code had no effect.  So I sudo'ed into code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/code and tried to edit codecom.apple.gamed.plist/code. Try as I would, I couldn't get write permission for the file. The same happened when I tried to rename the codegamed/code image.  What has Apple done to permissions? There don't seem to be any special ACLs on code/System/Library/.../code, but root cannot change files for which root has coderw/code permissions. (This explains presumably why codesudo default write.../code had no effect.)  Has anyone else seen this? Is there any way round it?  Steve  <answer210499> OS X 10.11, El Capitan, introduced System Integrity Protection (SIP).  The contents of code/System/code and a few other paths are now protected and can not be edited. Even coderoot/code user can not edit the contents of these paths.  You can disable SIP but it is generally not recommended:     ol   liReboot your Mac into Recovery Mode by restarting your computer and holding down kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd until the Apple logo appears on your screen./li   liClick Utilities  Terminal./li   liIn the Terminal window, type in codecsrutil disable/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li   liRestart your Mac./li   /ol   <comment254059> It seems to be that : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193368/what-is-the-rootless-feature-in-el-capitan-really <comment254091> It is indeed that. Thank you. I was coming at it from my `gamed` problem, so I didn't conduct the appropriate searches. Apologies.
