Where does Chrome's Gmail Offline store its files on my Mac? <body> I have added strongGmail Offline/strong to Chrome on OS X Mavericks. Where on my Mac are the offline files (such as attachments) and the app itself stored?  Google nor StartPage are very helpful in finding any real answers.  <answer213150> Gmail Offline usually stores its files under your strongprofile path/strong.    You can find your profile path by typing codechrome://version/code in the address bar, and searching for Profile Path.    The path is usually:      /Users/%username%/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/     Alternatively, if you are logged in under the account you want to explore, the path is:     ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/   If you have a Chrome user profile other than the default one, replace Default with that profile name.    You should then look at the "Local Storage" and "Local Extension Settings" directories under that path.   <answer252495> The actual files (attachments etc.) are stored in   precode~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/File System /code/pre  In that folder my gmail files were stored under code009/t//code and then 100 files per subfolder, numbered code00/code and up. Within these "File System" folders all files are numbered in sequence by which you first viewed/downloaded them and they don't have any file endings.  I would assume that unique apps are attributed their own "File System" subfolder by sequence in which you first use them. So gmail files may not alway be in subfolder "009".  <comment257364> Thanks! And the apps are of course in User/Applications/Chrome Apps.
