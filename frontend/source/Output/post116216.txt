Gray folder with circle next to it <body> I've got the strangest problem with some of my folders on an external drive. They folders in the root of the drive show up, but they are grayed out and I can't click them. However if I change viewing mode I can see the files that they contain. Any idea what this could be and how to fix it? I've attached two screenshots of the different events.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oaenq.png" alt="In column mode"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQxs7.png" alt="In list mode"  <answer116219> It's a tag without an assigned colour, and the contents is hidden due to the view options. Change the view options (âŒ˜J) to Sort By and Arrange By Name.
