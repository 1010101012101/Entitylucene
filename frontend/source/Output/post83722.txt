Ruby 2.0.0 fails to install because of openssl <body> I can't install ruby from source, on configuration (em./configure/em) it states  precodeIgnore OpenSSL broken by Apple. Please use another openssl. (e.g. using `configure --with-openssl-dir=/path/to/openssl') Failed to configure openssl. It will not be installed. /code/pre  Even if I use the told parameter. em--with-opt-dir=/usr/local/em doesn't help either. Notice, I installed the latest openssl (1.0.1e) from source too (it's located at /usr/local/ssh).   So later I can't use emgem install/em, it just states:  precodeERROR:  Loading command: install (LoadError)     cannot load such file -- openssl ERROR:  While executing gem ... (NoMethodError)     undefined method `invoke_with_build_args' for nil:NilClass /code/pre  How can I tell the ruby installation to take my installed openssl?  <answer83728> Rather than doing all the building from sources (and having to hunt down any necessary patches) why not try using rvm to build (and manage) your rubies, and homebrew to allow you to build and install the necessary dependencies.  I have used these to get a ruby 2.0.0 build completed earlier today, although I haven't had a chance to check if it's fully functional yet.  <answer83888> Had a similar issue on Tiger (yes, I'm using Ruby 2.0 on a Power Mac G4) â€“ Ruby builds there just fine, but codegem install rails/code fails with "RuntimeError: Unsupported digest algorithm (SHA512).".  Assuming you meant code/usr/local/ssl/code and not code/usr/local/ssh/code for the directory containing OpenSSL 1.0.1e, you should run code./configure/code as such:  code./configure --prefix=/opt/ruby20 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl/code  The configure script will say that --with-openssl-dir is an invalid option.  It's lying.  Add /opt/ruby20/bin (or whatever you set as your prefix) to your PATH and enjoy Ruby 2.0 :)  <answer295496> You need to change the code page of the current terminal window running this code:  precodechcp 1252 /code/pre  <comment96461> I dislike using rvm and homebrew, further I never had any problems building a previous ruby version from source. <comment96564> That worked, great! _configure_ saying it is an invalid option really confused me, i never tried to build with that configuration. And yes i meant ssl - sorry for that. <comment142715> Adam S.: Apple is [deprecating OpenSSL as of 10.7](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7406946/why-is-apple-deprecating-openssl-in-macos-10-7-lion) which is part of the reason that it is broken. <comment204691> In addition to this, I had to configure openssl with the special darwin flag e.g.  ./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc when installing openssl.  Otherwise it didn't provide libraries for ruby to install with (or possibly just put them in a weird location) <comment373123> Welcome to Ask Different.
