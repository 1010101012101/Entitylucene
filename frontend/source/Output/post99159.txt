Only 3 FPS on Mac mini, boot camp, windows 7 <body> Using the GPU test tool from FurMark i get only 3 FPS.   In normal use I notice it when playing fullscreen videos: When the video pans horizontal i get these stripes across the picture.  My setup is like this:  Mac mini 2011 2.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5/ 2 GB DDR3 SDRAM (PC3-10600)/500 GB HD/Intel HD 3000/Thunderbolt OS: windows 7 Tv: Panasonic G10 50" plasma Tv and computer are connected with an 2 meter HDMI cable  I've tried to change the HDMI cable - did not change anything.  What can I try?  <answer104949> Finally! - I worked out what the problem was.   I had followed the speedup-tip:     Head to the Control Panel's Performance Information and Tools section, and choose Adjust  Visual Effects. Here you'll find a long list of effects, but simply choosing "Adjust for  best performance" will turn everything off. You'll feel like you stepped back into a decade ago.   <comment116568> Did you install the bootcamp tools following the Windows 7 install? http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1638 <comment116575> System has been running for 18 moneths without this flickering. Just upgraded to the latest version of bootcamp software you liked to. But the problem persistes :-( <comment123410> Good to hear you've solved it - to represent that on StackExchange, please post your solution as an *answer*, and accept it by checking the adjacent checkmark!
