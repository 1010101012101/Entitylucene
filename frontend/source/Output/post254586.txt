How do you ask Siri to message whatsapp group? <body> I know the new IOS allows you to ask Siri to send a whatsapp message to a person, can Siri message a whatsapp group ?  <answer254592> Due to SiriKit API limitation, Siri can send a message only to a sigle "entity", which could be a contact or an existing group but, actually, you can't write a message to multiple entities in a single action.   <answer282363> I figured out today how to do it.   First, you need to be sure that the name of the group can be easily understand by Siri. As I know from myself some group names are too complex for Siri. It will be simple if the group name is like a person's name.   Second, you need to add the group name to your contacts without any number etc. just create a new empty person with the group name.
