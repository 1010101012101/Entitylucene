Mac mouse acceleration <body> I installed the Logitech driver for my G500 mouse. This driver overrides the standard acceleration curve and leaves it just linear. I want the original one back. But just uninstalling the driver (using the included tool) didn't help.  Before I installed the driver, I already had a program called ControllerMate that shows the acceleration curve. The original one was really good but of course I don't remember each detail. I only wanted to have the driver to use the extra mouse buttons.  <comment281575> This may be too specific, I'm not sure if you'll find a whole lot of answers. <comment281609> Yeah, I guessed so already. Thanks anyway. It by the way is working normally again after reboot. Anyhow, it would be great to get some more details on that since I first like this bit of more control and second I'd like to use the other keys. So I need the Logitech driver.
