Recommendation for simple project/task time tracking app <body> I'm looking for a very simple app to allow me to track my time on particular user-defined strongprojects/strong or strongtasks/strong.   However, my requirement is slightly different to those in questions such as Is there a good time automatic time tracking tool for Mac OS X as I don't need something that will automatically track my time spent in particular applications such as Time Sink or Time Track Pro. Rather, what I want to be able to do in a rough "must have" to "nice to have" order is:  ul liAdd user-defined projects/tasks to a list each with its own timer/li liManually start and stop project/task timers as I switch projects/li liIdle timer to stop recording activity if I leave the computer for a period of time/li liAccess the app from the menubar (ability to hide dock icon would be a bonus too)/li liCreate subtasks from the main project/task/li /ul  So, apologies in advance for the following, but in my head the interface might look something like the following, but again I'm strongtotally open to suggestions/strong:  precodeProject          Time --------------------- Project X        0:32   &lt;Start/Stop Button&gt; Project Y        4:00   &lt;Start/Stop Button&gt; Project Z        1:25         Subtask 1    1:00   &lt;Start/Stop Button&gt;     Subtask 2    0:25   &lt;Start/Stop Button&gt; /code/pre  For example, Harvest looks perfect for what I need, apart from the fact that there's a $12 per month cost. I'm not against paying for an application, but I'd like to avoid ongoing charges if possible.  <answer48179> I'm not entirely sure what you mean, but it looks like On The Job is the application you are looking for. It will cost you money as well, but a one time license will provide you with a full version.   Another (paying) app is Office Time. Great in syncing with multiple platforms (PC, Mac, and iOS) and does a job similar to On The Job, mentioned above.   I can think of a third application which will suit your needs, but I can't remember the name. I'll keep thinking and upate my answer as soon as I know it!  <answer48188> I would check out TSheets time tracker. They have a free single user account, it is simple to set up with your job codes and click back and forth between projects, and although they have an extensive list of time tracking features you can customize your account to be as basic as you'd like. I have been very pleased with this company.   <answer48694> In the end, I found Timecop that does almost everything I wanted: simple project tracking with a variety of configurable reports spanning days, weeks, or months.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q1FQh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Honourable mentions go to Tictoc which does a very similar job to Timecop, and Timing (which also has a free, Lite version). Timing is different in that its a "traditional" application tracker, however, you can create custom projects and drag applications into them, right down to the document level. So you can attribute different documents in a single app to different projects, which is great if you're working on two different projects in Xcode, for example.   <answer100145> I use hr - Task Timer which is very similar to Timecop and Tictoc, but free.  <answer121371> On the Job is good but lacks reporting.  Trying Officetime now and it looks like exactly what I need for non-billing time tracking.  Super simple, inexpensive and has reporting.    <answer178887> Here's another option: Toggl. They offer free and paid plans.  <comment55184> Thanks! Yes, thats the sort of thing I'm after, but perhaps those "enterprise class" apps are a bit overkill for what I need. As its just for my personal projects, I probably won't need all the billing and invoicing features - but they do have task timers and I'm happy to take all suggestions nonetheless :) <comment141474> This is a bit vague, could you add more information?
