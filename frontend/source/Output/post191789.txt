Current line number keeps to be 0 no matter where cursor is <body> Please see the attached to images.  When I change the line the line numbers changes, so that the cursor's line number is always 0, the previous and next line numbers are always 1.  Is it a bug?

Absolute line numbers will count the more traditional way from the top of the file.  <comment227876> I have commented out: "if exists("&relativenumber") "       set relativenumber "       au BufReadPost * set relativenumber "endif
