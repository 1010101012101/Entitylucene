Hide a running app from Dock? <body> Is there a way I can hide a running app's dock icon Mac OS X?  <answer68916> strongImportant Note:/strong In Mac OS X 10.5+ the method explained below only works for apps which are not using the "Code Signing" feature which was introduced in 10.5 to ensure authenticity of running code. The result of applying this method to a signed app differs; it might cause the app to  crash upon starting or results it unexpected behavior.  You can edit the file codeInfo.plist/code contained in the directory of each App (e.g. code/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/Info.plist/code)by adding the following lines:  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt; /code/pre  For example:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;BuildMachineOSBuild&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;11G63&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;CFBundleDevelopmentRegion&lt;/key&gt;          ...         ... &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  When you will start the App you will see the icon just for one second and the it will disappear.  codeDockless/code and codeDock Dodger/code do this change automatically in apps.  <answer79184> ol liThis worked great. I wanted to open Mail every 15 minutes so I created a script in Applescript Editor that looks like this:     repeat   br    tell application "Mail"   br        activate   br        delay 60 * 15   br    end tell   brend repeat   The delay of 60 is 60 seconds and I multiplied it by 15 (=15 minutes)/li liThen in Applescript I clicked "Compile" then "Save" and named it "Mail Every 15" BUT made sure to name it as an Application not as a Script in my Applications folder./li liGo to your Finder and in your Applications folder is your new file "Mail every 15". Right click that file and choose "Show package contents"Contents. br You'll see a file named Info.plist in which you can open the file in your text editor by double clicking./li liOnce you open the file insert the code mentioned above and put just under the "dict" line  Note: Once you start trying to edit it will warn you:  You don’t have permission to write to the folder that the file “Info.plist” is in. You can duplicate this document and edit the duplicate. Only the duplicate will include your changes.  Go ahead and duplicate it and make the 2 line change with the insert. Save the file to your desktop as Info.plist (just like the original file)./li liYour Finder should still be open, if not, reopen it by repeating step 3. Rename the original file, I named it Info-A.plist (just for safe measure. I'm sure you could just move the file to trash but I didn't want to take chances.)/li liI Swapped places with the files (Moved Info.plist from the desktop to the "Mail every 15Contents" folder and moved the Info-A.plist to the desktop)/li liGo to System PreferencesUser &amp; GroupsLogin Items and then I clicked on the + sign to add a login application to start it at boot up or login. Now it opens every 15 minutes and the Icon and App are no longer visible when it opens./li /ol  Hope this helps because I don't know anything about Macs and had to do a lot of research before I finally got it right. This web page was where I was at when I finally got it right so I'm logging this one for future reference.  <comment80073> Sick, is there an app that automates this though ? <comment80074> @Fendi I added two Apps that did that. However I've never tried them with the latest OS X versions. <comment80077> Is there a particular reason that this method is not working with Parallels ? <comment80078> @Fendi I don't know, I'm not a Parallels user so I cannot test it. Sorry! <comment252701> This worked for me when hiding notifications from Spotify dock. One side effect though is the top spotify bar disappears. It seems my machine doesn't know Spotify is running so I can't quit. W/e gets rid of notification numbers
