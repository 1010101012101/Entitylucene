Screen sharing with server fails <body> I am managing a Mac server cluster and I can do screen sharing from my Mac to the cluster without a fuss.  However a colleague of mine receives the following error upon trying to switch on screen sharing:  "The server may not exist or it is unavailible at this time. Check the server name or IP address, check your network connections and then try again"   This leaves me dazzled as we both own the latest version of Mavericks and ssh works perfectly for my colleague and myself...  Is this a known bug? Is there some way I can find out what is going wrong?  Thank you for your help.
