Which cord/hardware senses closure of Macbook pro lid? <body> I replaced the keyboard on my 2011 Macbook Pro, and when I got the computer up and running again, it won't go to sleep when I close the lid.  And once I manually put it to sleep, it won't wake up again unless i press a button on the keyboard (ie, it's not sensitive to me opening the lid).  I have attempted most software-based fixes (eg., resetting SMC, checking for background apps or processes preventing it from sleeping), but it has not affected it, so I am thinking that maybe it's a hardware issue I created when I replaced the keyboard.  Anyone have a guess as to which piece of hardware is responsible for sensing whether lid is open or closed?  The display LVDS cable?  Any help appreciated!  <comment337564> Check [this iFixIt question](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/166231/screen+won't+turn+off+when+closing+lid).
