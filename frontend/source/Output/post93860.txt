Work database with visual interface <body> I need a app that can help me work on a database with visual aid, I don't need it to be in a specific language, is only that I can see the workflow to better understand all the links between tables  <answer93867> There are a few tools that can visually display database schemas. If you're using MySQL, you can use MySQLWorkbench. Commercially, there is the Navicat line of products. I haven't used them though. They are available on the Mac app store.   Looking just now, I see Wikipedia has a page on data modeling tools.  <comment110061> How does a database have a workflow  could you expand on that <comment110063> Thanks, MySQLWorkbench is perfect for what I need
