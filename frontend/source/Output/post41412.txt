Using tmux and pbpaste, pbcopy, and launchctl <body> I have discovered that tmux breaks codepbpaste/code, codepbcopy/code and codelaunchctl/code.  Is there a good way to make it play nice with these tools?  <answer41414> Okay, I found a solution...  Chris Johnsen has a good writeup of what causes this problem on github.  His tools work, but a better solution, if you have homebrew installed to:  precodebrew install reattach-to-user-namespace /code/pre  Then in your code~/.tmux.conf/code add these lines:  precodeset-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l zsh" # or bash bind C-c run "tmux show-buffer | reattach-to-user-namespace pbcopy" bind C-v run "reattach-to-user-namespace pbpaste | tmux load-buffer - &amp;&amp; tmux paste-buffer" /code/pre  The first line ensures your shell can talk to codepbpaste/code, codepbcopy/code and codelaunchctl/code now with no worries.  The second line lets you copy the codetmux/code paste buffer into the Mac's paste buffer by typing kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdb/kbd kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdc/kbd (replace kbdcontrol/kbd-kbdb/kbd with your tmux prefix key).  The third line will directly paste the Mac's paste buffer by typing kbdcontrol-v/kbd.  As a side-effect it copies the Mac's paste buffer into codetmux/code's paste buffer.  I'd prefer if I could nuke codetmux/code's paste buffer entirely and have it paste directly into the Mac`s paste buffer, but... oh well.
