Prevent iOS from closing background app <body> I use an app called "GPS Tracks" to track my movements throughout the day with my iPhone 6 on iOS 9.2.1. The app often shuts down while it is actively recording in the background, which the developer indicated is something that happens when memory runs low.  Is there anything I can do to either 1) prevent iOS from shutting down a specific app for memory reasons or 2) tell iOS which apps to shut down first or 3) be warned when the app is closed by iOS.  I am ready to jailbreak it if necessary.  <comment282999> Why not keep the app open even if it means keeping the screen on or setting Auto-Lock to Never? <comment283012> I use the App all day to record my movements in the background, so this isn't possible.
