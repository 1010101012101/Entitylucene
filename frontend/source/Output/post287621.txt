Keys rebinding lead to strange things <body> Temporary I need to work on Mac but I do not really want to switch no new keybindings. I used to use Karabiner to rebind keys some time ago but at the moment Karabiner is not working with OS X Sierra.  So I changed couple keybindings (copy, paste, cut, etc.) in the system keyboard settings (Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts) to same keys but with Control instead of Command, like on Windows.  Mostly it works OK but in some cases not, for example when I press Ctrl-v instead of codePasting/code it takes my cursor to the end of the text editing field and only If i press Ctrl+v for second time (and cursor must stay in the very end) it actually pastes the text from clipboard. It works the same way in all the applications.  Another problem, in my text editor I binded some operation to Control+/, and it works but every time I press the combination - Mac does it default "dung" sound, like when you trying to do something that is not allowed. Actually it does the sound even without my binding. What does it try to do?  How can I solve it? Thanks.
