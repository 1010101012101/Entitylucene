How do I enable horizontal scroll on a Touchpad in macOS Sierra? <body> I've searched everywhere in the Trackpad settings and am not able to find anything that suggests I can do a horizontal scroll on a MacBook Pro (2015).   Is this possible in macOS?  If not, are there any third party tools that could make this happen?  <answer285743> If you goto System Prefs and then click on General there is a scroll bar setting about mid page. The first setting actually refers to trackpad and mouse. You might try selecting the 'always' option. This may only control the vertical scroll bars but it worth a try.  <comment360846> This doesn't work but thank you!
