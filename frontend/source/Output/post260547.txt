CPU throttled to 0.8GHz due to "GPU LIMIT PROCHOT" <body> Suddenly my iMac (late 2013) started to throttle CPU to 0.80GHz, everything becomes super sluggish. It happens ~5-10 min after a fresh reboot, sometimes it goes back to full speed for short periods, but most of the time stays throttled. I tried to reset SMC, it doesn't seem to help. Also did clean install of Sierra, also did not help...  powermetrics reports that throttling occurs due to "GPU LIMIT PROCHOT", even though temperature is normal on all sensors I could take a peek on.  precode$ sudo thermal levels cpu: 180 gpu: 30 io: 30    $ sudo powermetrics ... **** Processor usage ****  Intel energy model derived package power (CPUs+GT+SA): 2.48W  LLC flushed residency: 65.9%  System Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 27.52% (798.17 Mhz) Package 0 C-state residency: 67.72% (C2: 9.36% C3: 2.08% C6: 56.28% C7: 0.00% )   Performance Limited Due to: GPU LIMIT PROCHOT  Core 0 C-state residency: 83.91% (C3: 0.00% C6: 0.00% C7: 83.91% )  CPU 0 duty cycles/s: active/idle [&lt; 16 us: 92.56/27.35] [&lt; 32 us: 14.86/12.29] [&lt; 64 us: 19.82/76.90] [&lt; 128 us: 32.70/49.35] [&lt; 256 us: 49.15/26.76] [&lt; 512 us: 32.90/34.68] [&lt; 1024 us: 27.15/21.80] [&lt; 2048 us: 5.95/33.30] [&lt; 4096 us: 0.40/36.47] [&lt; 8192 us: 0.20/14.67] [&lt; 16384 us: 55.49/0.00] [&lt; 32768 us: 2.18/0.00] CPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 27.52% (798.17 Mhz)   Core 1 C-state residency: 84.27% (C3: 0.00% C6: 0.00% C7: 84.27% )   CPU 1 duty cycles/s: active/idle [&lt; 16 us: 125.26/30.32] [&lt; 32 us: 6.94/8.92] [&lt; 64 us: 16.05/82.65] [&lt; 128 us: 45.19/44.79] [&lt; 256 us: 30.52/32.31] [&lt; 512 us: 34.29/40.83] [&lt; 1024 us: 21.60/22.99] [&lt; 2048 us: 10.11/30.13] [&lt; 4096 us: 5.75/38.05] [&lt; 8192 us: 9.32/22.99] [&lt; 16384 us: 47.96/0.20] [&lt; 32768 us: 1.39/0.00] CPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 27.52% (798.18 Mhz)   Core 2 C-state residency: 82.53% (C3: 0.02% C6: 0.00% C7: 82.50% )   CPU 2 duty cycles/s: active/idle [&lt; 16 us: 130.81/31.91] [&lt; 32 us: 8.32/3.37] [&lt; 64 us: 19.82/104.84] [&lt; 128 us: 41.42/44.00] [&lt; 256 us: 38.65/33.30] [&lt; 512 us: 34.09/46.38] [&lt; 1024 us: 27.95/20.02] [&lt; 2048 us: 13.48/28.94] [&lt; 4096 us: 6.94/41.03] [&lt; 8192 us: 10.11/24.77] [&lt; 16384 us: 46.38/0.20] [&lt; 32768 us: 0.79/0.00] CPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 27.52% (798.17 Mhz)   Core 3 C-state residency: 86.15% (C3: 0.00% C6: 0.00% C7: 86.15% )   CPU 3 duty cycles/s: active/idle [&lt; 16 us: 105.64/27.95] [&lt; 32 us: 5.95/0.99] [&lt; 64 us: 13.28/80.07] [&lt; 128 us: 39.04/35.48] [&lt; 256 us: 29.93/25.57] [&lt; 512 us: 32.31/36.07] [&lt; 1024 us: 20.41/22.40] [&lt; 2048 us: 4.76/26.95] [&lt; 4096 us: 2.38/34.29] [&lt; 8192 us: 2.58/22.59] [&lt; 16384 us: 54.90/0.00] [&lt; 32768 us: 0.79/0.00] CPU Average frequency as fraction of nominal: 27.52% (798.17 Mhz)  **** SMC sensors **** CPU Thermal level: 180 GPU Thermal level: 30 IO Thermal level: 30 Fan: 2471 rpm CPU die temperature: 38.38 C GPU die temperature: 41.00 C /code/pre  I checked all sensors and there is not a single one reporting temperature higher than 42C. What are those thermal levels based on?  Desperately seeking for any pointers... Thanks in advance!  <comment326261> do the fans rev up when this happens? and did you try resetting the smc as described in this article:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295 <comment326271> fan stays at 1400rpm all the time. I thought there was some issue with the fan and tried to set it manually at max - it did not make any difference to throttling. As for resetting smc - it was the first thing I tried, several times. <comment326273> and did you try executing the apple hardware test as described in this article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257 <comment326283> Yes, also multiple times. It reports no issues <comment326286> Can you try setting the fan speed higher by hand with a program like this: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23049/smcfancontrol ? It is not a solution but it should speed up the machine again. And did you ever change anything on the mac, like a new hdd for instance? <comment326296> Yeah already tried that, been running fan full speed for couple of hours, temperature got down to 38C, but still throttled. And never changed anything inside... <comment327683> And did you change anything on the mac like I asked? Also, please update your question with all the steps you have taken, this makes it easier to help. And would have saved me the time of asking all these questions..
