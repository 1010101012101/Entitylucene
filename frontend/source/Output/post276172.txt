Synchronizing iBooks with iPad/iPhone does not synchronize collections <body> When I synchronize iBooks from my MacBook to my iPhone/iPad via iTunes it synchronizes all my books, but it doesn't synchronize the collections (they are all just dumped into one single collection).  How do I synchronize the collections?  EDIT: the `Settings - Synchronize bookmarks, highlights, and collections across devices" option is enabled.  <answer276204> Go to Settings/Ibooks and turn on "Sync Collections" (also sync bookmarks and comments if you want that too).  <comment347510> Take a look at [this post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/245399/88313).  It's a similar question but doesn't have an accepted answer yet. <comment347516> This [site](https://miapple.me/fixing-ibooks-not-syncing-pdf-files-epub-books-mac-ipad-iphone/) may help. <comment347652> If you mean `Settings - Synchronize bookmarks, highlights, and collections across devices` it is turned on :/
