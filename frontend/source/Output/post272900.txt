In macOS, is there a keyboard shortcut to move windows to other desktops? <body> Mission Control allows for multiple desktop (spaces). Does there exist a keyboard shortcut for moving an application's window from one to another?  <answer272901> You can hold the window with your mouse and use the usual keyboard shortcuts to move the window across desktops.  <answer272902> No, but you can use a third party application, like BetterTouchTool, which allows you to bind key combinations to user defined actions, including moving windows between spaces.  <comment372630> This is the best solution I have found. In BetterTouchTool's preferences, choose "Add New Shortcut.., and then choose "Move Window One Space/Desktop Left|Right" from "Trigger Predefined Action"
