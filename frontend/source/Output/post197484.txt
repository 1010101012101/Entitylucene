itunes 12.1 song into ringtone for iPhone <body> I can't save segment of song as AAC in order to use as ringtone. Stuck at that stage. I am using iTunes 12.1.0.05. There seem to be solutions for earlier iTunes versions. I've edited song to be 30 seconds.  <answer197490> Out of the box the iTunes will have save as MP3.  To change that to AAC, open iTunes preferences:  In the general tab click on the Import settings.  Select AAC  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ft2vb.jpg" alt="aac"  Now  you will have the "Create AAC"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8mglS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Thats it, the rest you know.  <answer200220> As Eric says, you need the file to be converted to .aac &amp; have the extension .m4r.  It also needs to be 40 seconds or less in length.  OK, you could pay 50 bucks to do that - or you could do it for strongfree/strong.  Use Audacity to cut to correct length &amp; export as .aac  Then drop the file onto MakeiPhoneRingtone to convert it for the phone.  Drop the result onto iTunes &amp; sync.  <answer201770> If you have GarageBand ( on you iPhone will be best)  You can create a ringtone using the instruments and recoding features.  Open GarageBand.   ul liClick the (+) symbol to open a new Song/li /ul  .  ul liChoose your instrument or sample./li liPlay something you like while recording. (red button)/li liStop the recording when done. ( I assume you can do an edit if need be.)/li liClick the button ( Triangle pointing down in the top of the menu bar) to go back to My Songs. The song will be saved./li liClick Select and select your song./li liThen click the share button ( Square with arrow pointing up)/li liChoose Ring tone and follow the instructions./li /ul  On the iPhone if you just choose done at the end, the exported file will appear in your ringtones under sounds.
