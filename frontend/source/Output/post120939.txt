Is there any way to make the ipad's front camera view angle wider? <body> Ipad mini front camera viewing angle is so small so if a group of people wants to be in the picture during chat , the ipad mini should be placed meters away. Is there any setting or any app that allow to change or control that? (something like ZOOM out for front camera)  <answer120940> No, there is no software setting to make the front camera wider than it already is. If it is fully zoomed out in the app, then it can't go any further.
