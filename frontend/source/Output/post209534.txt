Notes 4.0 (El Capitan) strikethrough option removed <body> Does anyone know how to apply a strikethrough to text in the new Notes app? It seems the option has been removed entirely from all font menus, contextual menus and even the font palette!  <answer209567> Yeah, the option is a bit well hidden, dunno why. Its called strongStruck through/strong  instead of strikethrough  To get the text formatting in strongNotes 4.0/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUwPy.png" alt="enter image description here"  1) Make a text selection for the emstruck through/em, right click on it  2) Select strongFonts/strong then strongStyles/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EWZPh.png" alt="select the thext for struck through"  3) Use the strongStyle Browser/strong or whatever that is called  to check the strongFavourite Styles/strong and then select strongStruck Through/strong from the dropdown list. Tada!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWiOg.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWow./strong That was strongemreally easy/em/strong and accessible, right? Why not add  another step since all that makes a lot of sense. I guess, this time  Apple struck through the UX.   Here one close-up of the option. I think one can make a Keyboard  shortcut that will make this more ehh sane to use. Maybe there is one already.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qW8fo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240563> I believe that ⇧⌘L is intended to replace striking items through. This provides you with a very nice list that you can check and uncheck items. It is annoying that they would bury the strikethrough, but I do enjoy the checklist a lot more, especially when viewing the notes on my iPhone or iPad.  <answer249706> To add on to PJJ's answer, you can more quickly strike through text with the copy style keyboard shortcut. Select some already struck through text, kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdc/kbd (strongFormat  Font  Copy Style/strong). Then select the text you want to strike through and kbdOpt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdv/kbd (strongFormat  Font  Paste Style/strong).   From: Has anyone figured out a keyboard shortcut to globally strikethrough selected text in any OS X app?  <answer278892> Notes checklists are way cool, but that's only one of many uses for strikestrikeout/strike (errrr .... "struck out").  <comment252800> Wow, thanks! What were they (not) thinking!? <comment252821> Yeah, they don't use lists? Took me a while to figure that out. Will be probably corrected with the next update ;) <comment328783> What a horribly obscure place to hide a formatting feature that lots of people use.  I vaguely remember there being a shortcut in the past using the "-" character in combination with other control characters that would strikethrough selected text.  That, however, doesn't seem to exist anymore.  Would love if they put this in a better place or assigned a shortcut. SMH. <comment363230> Apple definitely "struck" out on this.
