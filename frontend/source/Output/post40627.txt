Is there an audio player with waveform seekbar? <body> I'm looking for a player with seekbar that displays the waveform of the playing song, like http://foobar2000.org + http://foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_wave_seekbar  Specifically, a seekBar is an extension of ProgressBar that adds a draggable thumb and also provides a waveform preview of track in the background of the bar's on-screen area.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UTZrr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40629> h1VirtualDJ Home Version (free)/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3OqJo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40636> Its more of an audio emeditor/em than a emplayer/em, so might not be exactly what you want, but Fission from Rogue Amoeba is an excellent tool that displays the waveform of the loaded audio file. You can zoom in and out of portions of the audio and drag the play point to wherever you wish.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IquIW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40754> Capo  Audacity  GarageBand  SoundCloud app for Mac OS X  These programs all have different purposes. Some are commercial and some are free. Each of them will do what you want.  <answer44085> h1Transitions Player (free)/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HqCle.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44086> h1MIXXX (open source)/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TalKs.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer89821> i have the same question and find this, but is only for windows (my OS).Mi don't know if there is a Mac version or if you can use an emulator http://audiops.codeplex.com/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B02n0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer94656> http://nulloy.com is a player that runs not only on OS X but also Linux and Windows. I'm the developer of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v5myX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer296093> This is more of a workaround, but you can open it with the standard QuickTime player and "trim", and it brings up the waveform of the track.

This sort of view is generally the realm of editors, not playback-only software. <comment45944> @diimdeep I'm not sure what you mean by seekbar. Could you explain this, please? <comment45945> seekBar is an extension of ProgressBar that adds a draggable thumb. waveform seekbar also provides waveform preview of track in background. <comment45946> thanks, but too heavy for me <comment45947> @diimdeep Thanks! BTW: I found this very detailed description @ [wiki.hydrogenaudio.org](http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=Foobar2000:Components/Waveform_Seekbar_(foo_wave_seekbar)). <comment45973> This site covers OS X and iOS. Is it OS X you're focused on here? <comment46049> I'm looking for player, not editor, but thanks anyway <comment48463> A nice web app that provides this functionality is http://soundcloud.com/ it fits all the criteria in your question and is cross-platform and hosted storage. <comment110978> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior.  Re *"you must disclose your affiliation in your answers."* <comment111069> Please forgive my bad manners, never used stackexchange before. <comment197685> Nulloy is great, very quick and light weight. <comment329185> Searching for an answer to this as well.. Nulloy **does not** support the Mac .m4v suffix, and this far, I've seen no .mp4 that does't simply present an error in the application.
