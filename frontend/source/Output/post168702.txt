Switching between open pdfs in Preview without losing your place <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nIEkz.png" alt="Multiple PDFs open in preview"  If I have multiple PDFs open in preview, as shown with the "table of contents" sidebar, if I click on one of the other documents and then return to the current document, it returns me to page 1 instead of the page I'm on (in this case, page 9). Is there any way to have preview return me to the page I'm on?  <answer168707> AFAIK only with a work-around:  ol liadd a bookmark with kbdcmd/kbdkbdD/kbd in your currently visible PDF/li lichoose another PDF read a bit and add a second bookmark there/li liswitch to bookmark view with kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbd5/kbd/li lichoose the bookmark of your first PDF in the sidebarbr You may delete the bookmark using the context menu  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqngP.png" alt="example"/li /ol  <answer168709> This might just be personal preference, but when I am working with multiple PDFs in Preview, I generally have them open in separate windows.  Say you have three PDFs open, each in their own Preview window. Then you can use kbdcmd/kbdkbd~/kbd to switch between active windows. Since they are all open in their own window, you will never lose your place in any of the documents.  The kbdcmd/kbdkbd~/kbd shortcut works for any application you have open, which has more than one window open, AFAIK.  If you are set on keeping all of the PDFs under one Preview window, I think klanomath's suggestion would be your best bet.  <answer270707> Option+Page Up/Down. Or on a Macbook, Fn + Option + Arrow Up/Down  <comment198030> Only if you have the Thumbnails view and then expand. <comment340219> Welcome to Ask Different!  We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.
