battery thermal sensor issue 2009 MBP <body> My macbook has never been water damaged, it has a faulty thermal battery sensor, the battery inside it is factory new. I can only currently run single user mode, as my macbook shuts down 15 seconds after starting in any other fashion. my question is, can i disable the sensor in single user mode? or can i just desolder it from the logic board itself?
