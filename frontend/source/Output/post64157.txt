How much does it cost to service a MacBook Pro battery? <body> I have a mid 2009 MacBook Pro and I just got a message saying that I should service my battery.  I tried to reset SMC and NVRAM but the problem persists and I fear I'll have my battery replaced. How much is Apple going to charge me?  My Mac is out of warranty and I see that the battery capacity is less than 80% than it was originally but apart from that it is working fine  <answer64158> See Replacing the Battery in your MacBook Pro for pricing information in various countries. In your case (Italy) it's 130 or 180â‚¬ depending on screen size.
