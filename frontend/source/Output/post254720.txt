Download El Capitan Installer now that Sierra is out <body> I have recently been having issues with my mac and want to do a clean install. I still have Yosemite and thought it’s a good time to upgrade the OS. However, I am wary of jumping directly to Sierra when it’s so fresh.  My specific circumstances:   ul liSierra emcould/em run on my computer (early 2015 Macbook Pro), but I would prefer to install El Capitan/li liI have not previously downloaded the El Capitan installer/li /ul  I realize apple provided a link to install El Capitan from Snow Leopard. However, when I follow the links to the app store to get the install file, I am met with this message:     This version of OS X 10.11 cannot be installed on this computer.   Is there a way to download the El Capitan installer now that Sierra is out, for more modern computer? Searching El Capitan on the app store yields no results for the installer.  <answer254730> It depends on your circumstances. It can be difficult to find old OS downloads.  If you purchased it previously it will be in the App Store under the codePurchased/code tab.   If your mac came with it pre-installed you may have to go the internet recovery or Recovery HD route, but that would entail wiping your hard drive in order to do the install. You could then migrate your user data from a Time Machine backup or similar.   Alternatively, if you have a bootable backup of your El Cap system (assuming you had it installed) you could reinstall that.   More specific answers will require more specific information from you (it's generally a good idea/helpful to provide more information so that answers can be geared towards your situation and others in the same situation can benefit).   Whatever you do, make sure you have a full working backup (which you have tested) so that you can revert should something fail.   <answer259326> I am not allowed to comment yet, I cannot even up-vote, so I will strongreiterate/strong strongPwdr's/strong first solution - "If you purchased it previously it will be in the App Store under the Purchased tab." Consider this an up-vote.  I also needed the El Capitan installer, and based on Pwdr's answer, I went to my App Store Purchased tab and found the installers for El Capitan, Mavericks, and Mountain Lion. I am downloading all of them.  This issue is a sore spot with me because I wanted to upgrade from Leopard to Lion years ago, but I had to first upgrade to Snow Leopard. The Apple store did not have Snow Leopard anymore, just Lion, and referred me instead to one of their "partners". Why does Apple expect a partner, like B.Buy, to provide better service than themselves? I ended up paying a premium at a Mac store for Snow Leopard ($50) that I used long enough to upgrade to Lion, and then to Mountain Lion.  <answer260068> The following link, opened in Safari, should trigger the App Store to show the El Capitan download even if it is not already in the purchases list.  https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12  I tried the link a few times but my App Store did not open. Maybe it was a server issue on Apples side or maybe it helped already having opened the App Store. Anyway today the link lead me correctly to the El Capitan download in the App Store.  strongUpdate:/strong After that I tried the link a few more times by directly clicking or by copy paste it into the URL-bar. Sometimes it worked but sometimes not. So it seems a matter of retrying until success. Just reloading the page with kbdCmd/kbd+kbdR/kbd did not have the same success rate as clicking into the URL-bar and resubmit the request by hitting Return.  Source of the link is the link of the OP  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886  where it is provided under the words "get El Capitan from the App Store"  strongUpdate2:/strong Here is what someone says on upgrading from Yosemite to El Capitan in an Apple discussion thread:      If you Mac is compatible with Sierra, then you cannot install El   Capitan unless you had previously downloaded it. The version you tried   to install is for those with Macs that cannot run Sierra or still have   Snow Leopard installed. Since your Mac cannot run Snow Leopard either,   there isn't a way for you to get El Capitan.   ... too sad.  So one idea left would be to get an older Mac of a friend. Log in the App Store with your account. Download El Capitan. And finally have access to it via your purchases tab in your account from your newer Mac.   <answer260069> the correct methods to obtain El Capitan are outlined in the above answers, via the Purchased tab. if however they are not working, you could find a public source, such as torrent and verify the Sha1 of the InstallESD.dmg against the link.  codeshasum /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ *.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg/code  for 10.11.6 El Capitan (15G31)  it should return code7739e3f62080000da5d28efa689c53976112a262/code  https://github.com/notpeter/apple-installer-checksums/blob/master/readme.md  <answer260871> FYI, for those having trouble downloading the El Capitan installer from the Mac App Store...  El Capitan will not come up in a keyword search. You need to switch to the Purchased tab and then manually scroll down the list and find it that way. In my case, I had installers in there going back to Lion.  Also note that once you you've downloaded it, you may still be unable to run it, since Apple doesn't let you revert directly to an older OS. You will need to create a bootable installer USB using Terminal:  http://www.macworld.com/article/2981585/operating-systems/how-to-make-a-bootable-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-installer-drive.html  <answer263596> Since MacOS images are digitally signed by Apple, you can safely download El Capitan using eg. BitTorrent (link), as long as you  ol liDon't run the codeInstall OS X El Capitan.app/code file, but only write the OS image it contains (codeContents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg/code) to a USB stick (because, as far as I can gather, only the install image is signed)/li liVerify the digital signature over codeContents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg/code, inside the downloaded codeInstall OS X El Capitan.app/code, as per this answer: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/262914/93129/li /ol  <answer273676> I just installed Mac OS X 10.11 emEl Capitan/em on a Mac with Mac OS X 10.10 emYosemite/em, despite the app store offering me only macOS 10.12 emSierra/em. My method was a variation on Pete's answer as edited from 1 Jan 2017.    ol liFrom the app store, I downloaded macOS 10.12 emSierra/em.

The first time through I didn't do this, but didn't have the OS install in my purchase history. I went through these steps a second time. The App Store refused to let me download again. I logged out of iTunes, which was logged in as a different user, and then the App Store let me download.)/li liOn the Snow Leopard computer, I used Safari to visit the URL from Pete's answer, https://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1147835434?mt=12 . The App Store appeared. It offered OS X El Capitan, release Sep 20, 2016, version 10.11.6. The description says, "this version of OS X El Capitan is for users running OS X Snow Leopard who would like to upgrade to macOS Sierra."/li liI clicked the download button.

Apple are keeping it available because it's a stepping stone from Snow Leopard & for machines that cannot run Sierra <comment317136> @Tetsujin: if you know where El Capitan is available for download (as your comment alludes) please provide an answer to the question. <comment317137> I've voted to close it as a dupe, it's a question that already has an answer. <comment317138> I see, good call. <comment317210> @Tetsujin Thank you for providing the other post. I followed the links on that post but it didn't work for me. I have updated the question for my specific circumstance, per Pwdr's suggestion <comment317241> I really don't know why it would be picky about what it installs on - but this is a new paradigm for Apple, leaving an older OS still available to those who don't have it in their Purchase History. Maybe [I've no evidence either way] it's a different version to the one you'd get from history. A good rule for in future, btw, is always to DL every OS, even if you never install it. that way you can always get it again later. <comment325841> Unfortunately, that link doesn't work. Clicking on "Get" results in the message "This version of OX S 10.11 cannot be installed on this computer."  I don't believe that to be a true limitation; I have a Late 2013 MacBook Pro Retina. <comment325879> @MikeB Maybe Apple disallows this link for Macs where Sierra can be installed. My MBP 13 is from late 2009 and the link works at least after some retries. I never saw the message you and the OP quoted. <comment325881> @MikeB So one idea would be to get an older Mac of a friend. Log in the App Store with your account. Download El Capitain. And finally have access to it via your purchases tab in your account. <comment325884> @MikeB Are you already on Sierra? <comment325886> Here is what apple says in one of its own support threads: https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7716132?start=0&tstart=0 _“If you Mac is compatible with Sierra, then you cannot install El Capitan unless you had previously downloaded it. The version you tried to install is for those with Macs that cannot run Sierra or still have Snow Leopard installed. Since your Mac cannot run Snow Leopard either, there isn't a way for you to get El Capitan.”_ <comment326063> I am not already on Sierra. <comment338367> Why was this downvoted? Short of going to the Genius Bar (hah), this seems like one of the only ways to do this if you don't already have El Capitan in your "Purchased" tab of the App Store. <comment338623> @BrianMorton I suspect people either associate BitTorrent with piracy only, or they don't fully understand digital signatures. If there's a flaw in my approach, I'd certainly like to know. <comment338714> I asked a [similar question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/269505/220592) (and answered it myself), which contains info on how to download the images right from osxapps.itunes.apple.com if people don't like BT :) <comment338847> thanks for that link. I'm finally able to download el capitan - hope it will install now... Worked first go for me BTW...
