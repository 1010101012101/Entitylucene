Early 90s Mac freeware anti-virus program <body> I'm trying to find information about a popular early 90s Macintosh freeware anti-virus program. I can't remember its name. As I recall it installed as an extension and the icon was a frilly black 'V' on a white background. I believe development stopped in the mid-90s in response to the threat of Word macro viruses.  Thanks  <answer189559> strongDisinfectant/strong was a popular freeware antivirus program on the Mac from the 80's until its official retirement at version 3.7.1 in 1998:     Announcement and Press Release May 6, 1998    Updated: October 11, 1998   I regret to announce that I am officially retiring Disinfectant, our free   anti-viral utility for the Macintosh. The current version 3.7.1 is the last   version. Disinfectant will not be updated for the new Autostart 9805 worm or for   any future viruses, worms, or other Macintosh malware.   It's the last antivirus I've used on my Macs. There hasn't been much need.  <comment224827> [Virex](https://books.google.com/books?id=AToEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT31&lpg=PT31&dq=HJC+Software+virex&source=bl&ots=kaGUf4NFtU&sig=BvfNCbeLcQiRfz5MLsNyLjp1lqg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nFZrVeLRN7OxsASb9oCAAQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=HJC%20Software%20virex&f=false), perhaps? I can't find a frilly black V icon, though. <comment224832> Wowâ€¦ early 90's all I can remember is Norton - we weren't so worried back then. We also thought Alta Vista was going to be the search engine of the future... <comment224853> That's it! The icon is a frilly V, but with a no symbol over it. Thanks for this bit of nostalgia
