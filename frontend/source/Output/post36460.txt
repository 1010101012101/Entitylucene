How do I burn a DVD ISO from a MacBook? <body> The MacBook Air can share DVD drives on other Macs. For reading disks this works great. However, I want to burn an ISO to the drive. The drive doesn't show up in Disk Utility. Is it possible to burn ISOs onto a shared drive from a MacBook Air?  <answer36464> Try to insert a empty disk into your mac. Then, share it with you MacBook Air. Now, you should have a new DVD-Icon in the finder sidebar.   It should now show up in the Disk Utility tool!  Or:  strongRight-Click/strong on the ISO-Image, and click strongBurn on CD/DVD/strong after you "connected" the empty CD/DVD to you MacBook Air via DVD-Sharing.   <comment41472> Good question! Just as a side note - in Lion it should be just as easy to copy the media using Lion's AirDrop and then use the other Mac to burn the DVD. <comment41473> @gentmatt you should upvote the question if you think its good :) +1 from me <comment41474> I know. And I really want to! But I've already used my 40 votes today because of all the newcomers! There are so many of them - I really thought that this was spam :D. I feel so dumb. I'll up vote tomorrow, promise! <comment41477> Ask Different was advertised on tuaw.com a few days ago. That'll be the source of the newcomers. :)
