Is there a tool to move all windows from one application to a particular location on a particular monitor <body> I use a couple of external displays with my MacBook Pro.  I like to keep my IDE (IntelliJ) on display 1 and web browser on display 2, and then the terminal on another display.  The issue is when I disconnect from external displays, my window locations are lost.  Is there a tool which can do this?  I already use SizeUp.  Cheers!
