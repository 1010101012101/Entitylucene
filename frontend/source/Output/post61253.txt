Why are my Apple Developer emails blue? <body> In Mail.app, the "Apple Developer" emails I get have a blue background, in the message list.  Why?  And how can I turn this off?  <answer61255> Mail automatically highlights emails from Apple. You can turn this off in the Rules tab of Mail Preferences.  <comment70692> Oh, I see it. I turned off that rule, but it's still blue. <comment70693> Ah, I guess it applies the rule once and the color sticks, so I now have to use Format - Color (command-shift-C) to reset their color to white. <comment70696> Yeah thatâ€™s what happens. Rules are only applied when new email arrives.
