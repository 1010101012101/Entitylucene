iPhone 3g iOS5 brightness problem <body> I have an iPhone 3g with the latest version of iOS installed. All of a sudden the display is is not visible anymore. I'm only able to see something if i put it in direct light, but it's like the brightness is set to the lowest (or even less).  I've checked the Brightness settings: "auto" is turned off and moving the slider doesn't change a thing.  I tried to restart the hardware with no results.  I tried a reset via iTunes. It worked of for a few hours but now the problem is back.  I know for sure that it is not a hardware problem because when I unlock the phone, it "flashes" to full brightness before going dim, so it's not that the hardware is not capable anymore, it's just not doing so.  Any help? Thanks.  <comment37036> Which version of iOS did you install on your iPhone 3G? <comment37209> To follow up on @Globalnomad’s comment: iOS 5 isn’t supported on the iPhone 3G; the last major update was 4.2.1. Did you actually install iOS 5, or something different?
