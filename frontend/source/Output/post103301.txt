How do I control Notification Center in iOS? <body> I have looked for this in different places, but have yet to find a satisfying answer.  Notification Center in iOS (6 and 7) has many different options. But, how are the options related to the updates the app receives in the background?   e.g., i turn notification center off, but leave the badges on for an app. Will the app receive updates in the background? And show in Lock screen, does this work when notification center is off?  Also, how is this all related to the emreal/em data updates an app can receive in iOS 7?  thanks!
