Mac operating system from disc at startup <body> Hello everyone and thank you in advance.  I have just downloaded Linux Ubuntu and put it on a disk. What i want to do is to hold C during the Mac startup so that I can choose to boot my mac through the CD with the Linux Ubuntu operating system. However, I am worried about what will happen when I run my Mac through this CD and I have some questions  ol liHow do I change back between operating systems?/li liWill the startup commands work the same?/li liWhat will happen if I turn my computer off and eject the disk? Will my Mac just launch normally?/li liAny other information about booting from a disk that may be relevant/li /ol  I understand this might seem stupid but please answer if you have any idea of how this whole "boot through CD thing works"! Thank you  <answer62842> ol liJust press Alt/Optn on startup./li liAbsolutely/li liYes/li liThere is noting special, read here on other bootup options/li /ol
