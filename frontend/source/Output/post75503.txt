Replacement for iPod.app on old iPhone 3G with large buttons for play/pause and prev/next track <body> I've dedicated my old iPhone 3G as a Bluetooth audio player.  It works great except for controlling the audio.  I find that the previous and next buttons are too close to the play/pause button on both the lock screen and in iTunes.  I often jump to the next song when I just wanted to pause the current song.  Are there any iOS 4.2.1 apps out there to fit my needs?  I found Big Button Music Player, which is the type of thing I'm looking for, but the current version requires iOS 5 or greater.  Any recommendations for apps to play the music I already have on my phone, and provide a UI with larger buttons?  <answer98179> You can try Track 8 - swipe to change tracks - but I'm not sure whether it is iOS 5 or later.  <comment115270> It works on iOS 5, too. <comment115274> OP is looking for a iOS 4.2.1 solution, Track 8 requires iOS 5. <comment115450> @patrix hence why I said 'not sure whether it is iOS 5 or later' <comment115453> Compatibility info is available in the App Store.
