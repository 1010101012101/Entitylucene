QuickTime Player > Export Clips <body> I've got an mp4 in QuickTime which has been split into several clips.  How do I export these separately as audio tracks?   <answer143606> File Menu  Duplicate [Cmd/Shift/s]br Delete extra clips.br File Menu  Export  Audio Only...  will save as .m4a  Repeat for each clip.  Tedious, but the best I can figure...  <comment169125> That exports the entire mp4. It doesn't export the separate clips. <comment169129> Changed answer to include splitting out each clip. <comment169131> Tedious but does the job. <comment169133> You used to be able to copy/paste a selection to a 'New Video/Audio Recording' & save that, but it seems they updated to allow clips directly to FCP/iMovie. Been a long time since I used video outside FCP.
