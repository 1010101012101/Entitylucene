How can I know external HDD used time? <body> I want to know how long I used my external HDD. The HDD is WD My Book model. How can I know that?  <answer82482> If your disk supports S.M.A.R.T. feature then you can learn it from Disk Utility through clicking to info button after selecting related disk from the disk list.  <comment80131> are you asking how old the unit is (for warranty purposes maybe) or are you trying to find out how much usage your drive has had? <comment80161> And exactly is "usage"? Time powered up, time of all read/writes? <comment80303> @StuWilson Latter one. I wanna know how long the drive being used.
