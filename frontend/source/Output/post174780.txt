How do I search ??_doc.xml file in a specified folder in Finder? <body> I have a lot of code??_doc.xml/code files in a folder, it's like:  precode13_doc.xml 16_doc.xml 87_doc.xml /code/pre  The filenames are all like two digits with code_doc.xml/code combined together.  I want to search them and have them showed in folder, and when I type ??_doc.xml in the search box, I get nothing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oLGhh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there anything wrong with my query? What should I type there?  Thanks  <answer174782> The Finder search box does not support wildcards. You can add additional criteria to narrow down your search, though.  ol liEnter strong_doc/strong in the search field to start a search./li liIn the bar that appears (showing "Search: This Mac" etc) click the plus sign button all the way to the right./li liIn the new row that appears, in the first combobox, select emName/em, then in the next one select emContains/em, then in the empty text box type strong_doc/strong (without wildcards or the file extension)./li liClick the plus sign button all the way to the right of this new row./li liIn the first combobox of the second row, choose emKind/em. In the second combobox, choose emOther/em. In the empty text box type strongxml/strong (without the leading period)./li /ol  This will narrow down your search to files whose names contain strong_doc/strong and whose extensions are strongxml/strong.  <comment205874> Thanks very much. I finally know how my search in Finder works after switching from Windows to OS X for years! <comment205875> You're welcome. There are lots of options to play with there, and you can save a search to use it again quickly in the future.
