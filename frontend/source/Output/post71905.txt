If I remove Apple Loops, will reinstalling Garage Band from the App Store later restore them? <body> I'm attempting to save some space on my new Mac, which had iLife preinstalled. I can confidently delete GarageBand and iMovie for now, since I can easily reinstall them later from the App Store should I need them. However, I'm trepidatious about removing their associated data (which are quite hefty) from code/Library/Application Support/GarageBand/code and code/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/code. Since these are outside the .app, I'm worried that they won't be included along with the App Store bundles. Does anyone know for sure one way or another?  <answer72105> Why don't you just zip them (The Unarchiver is nice) and store them in /Users/Shared until it's clear whether you need them again.  I've always used Shared for folders of Copies, Archives, Removed items, all zipped. Very handy.  <comment83887> Since the goal is to clear up disk space I will definitely be archiving and storing them externally - to be on the safe side. I'm sure I'll be able to answer this question after I've gone through it but I thought I'd ask if anyone had a definitive answer :)
