Make Wine app the default opener <body> I have Notepad which I open with "Wine".br I want to do that when I want to open file .txt, it will be opened by Wine Notepad.  How can I do that?  <answer15745> You will need:  ul limake a custom codelauncher/wrapper/code for the notepad, e.g. codeWineNotepad.app/code/li liand in CMD-I you must change the default application for .txt files to the new launcher - and "change all"/li /ul  how to create the custom launcher is here  <comment17093> only wondering why you want opening Windows Notepad for the text files... <comment17123> Because it's special notepad and I must it :/ <comment17166> thanks for this answer ^__^ but it's pretty hard.. maybe you have something more easy? <comment17167> yes. Install Parallels and the the launcher/wrapper will be created auto-magically... ;) <comment17168> I stuck here: --edit wineLocation if your wine install is not the default locationbr /         set wineLocation to "/usr/local/bin" What the means "wine install"? its at Applications, no? ohh ye and more question: can i get your skype/messenger? :) <comment17169> i'm not an wine user, so don't know what wine you got and where it is installed. Maybe some real wine user will give a better advice. ;) <comment17171> About Parallels: IF i want it, I need to download all window system and my computer will be more slower, thats right? <comment17172> you will need windows - yes. Windows will take some place on your HDD. When you will run parallels will consume memory a processor time. The overhead is approx. 5% (or less), in usual applications - so your windows app will run 5% slower as native. <comment17174> Now.. I need windows 7 :P you know where I can download? <comment27557> Good question, oh by the way, I hate to say it but ..... **This is madness!!!!!!!!!!!** <comment27558> I think [WineBottler](http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/) may help with this. I haven't actually tried it yet, so I can't say for sure. <comment37942> @Daniel You'll need to buy Windows for use in Parallels. Don't steal it.
