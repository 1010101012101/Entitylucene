Using osadecompile to get plain text AppleScript runs certain actions from the script <body> I've been using this solution to decompile AppleScript files before adding them to a Git repository. It basically creates a filter using codeosacompile/code and codeosadecompile/code to convert between plain text source and a compiled AppleScript.  I noticed however, that some applications referenced in the scripts are unexpectedly starting on codegit add/code and the culprit is codeosadecompile/code.  strongExample:/strong  When I run codeosadecompile script.scpt/code against the following script, a Firefox starts up:  precodetell application "Firefox"     open location "https://apple.stackexchange.com" end tell /code/pre  It doesn't open the location specified, however the Firefox process gets started and remains running.  strongQuestions:/strong  ul liIs there anything I can do to avoid this?/li liWhat exactly is happening here? Does the script run in background (other actions  from the scripts - like codesay "something"/code do not seem to run)?/li /ul  <answer268014> I am not sure what the technical reason for this is, but accessing the AppleScript dictionary of some applications seems to require opening them. When I try opening the AppleScript dictionary of Firefox through Script Editor, Firefox will also be opened. When I try opening the dictionary of Keynote v5.3 (iWork'09 version), the app is opened, while when I try this with Keynote v7.0.5, the app is not opened. As Script Editor exhibits the same behavior, I am not sure there's any way to avoid this with codeosadecompile/code.  I did not read the Apple Developer documentation on AppleScript in detail, but I noticed this sentence which also suggests some applications need to be opened to access their AppleScript dictionary while some donâ€™t:     An aete is useful in 10.4 and earlier, in both Carbon and Cocoa applications, to provide a dictionary that scripting languages can use without launching the application.   <comment336384> You are right, the Script Editor also starts Firefox when opening the example script.
