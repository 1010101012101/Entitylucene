How do I switch between multiple channels on the YouTube app for the iPhone? <body> I have two YT channels under the same g-mail ID and I can't for some reason choose between which channel I want to see open on the app. Everytime I sign in, I'm automatically directed to the channel which is not the default channel and I never use.   <answer198767> If you go to the 'Account' screen there should be a little arrow next to your name, if you click on that you should be able to switch channels. As for making it default you may just want to sign out of both accounts and then sign back into them in order of priority. Hope that helps.
