Minimise full screen Steam games in OS X Yosemite <body> Previously, in OS X Mavericks it worked to minimise games, or navigate through open apps with cmd+tab even if the game was opened in full screen but now you can't do that anymore. Pressing cmd+tab doesn't have any effect. Also I can't find any way to minimise the game.  I don't really know whether this problem is only for steam games or any other game, as I don't have any non-steam game.  <answer164737> In my experience it depends on the Game-programmer itself and has nothing to do with Steam, f.e. I recently bought 'Lords of Xulima' on Steam and the Game-Developer has disabled any Non-Fullscreen features.   Sometimes there is a trick though: With the game running, try pressing cmd+alt+esc. That will open the 'force quit'-window which then enables you to use cmd-tab.  Try it with your game.  <answer240322> codeCMD/code+codeH/code seems to work too.  Strangly codeCMD/code+codeM/codedoes not do anything.  <comment193203> Thanks, that's a real nice workaround! Too bad it's not something built in like Windows has...
