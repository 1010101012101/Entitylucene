Partition failed performing a fresh installation <body> I'm trying to partition a samsung ssd and want to perform a fresh OS X snow leopard install from dvd.  When I try to partition the disk in diskutil I get:  precodePartition failed POSIX reports: The operation couldn't be completed. Cannot allocate memory /code/pre  Looked at this link: http://www.cnet.com/au/news/partitioning-usb-hard-drives-that-fail-in-disk-utility-with-posix-error/.  The hardware is a MacBook Pro 2010 and it had Yosemite running for a few months and it would not boot anymore.   Any ideas?  <comment195391> It's kind of a non-answer, but can you connect an external USB drive and just try installing from the DVD to the external drive? That would isolate if the problem is the drive or Mac or the SSD.
