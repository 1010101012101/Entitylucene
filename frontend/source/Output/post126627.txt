Internal Hard Drive Not Visible <body> I have an early 2009 MacBook running OSX 10.9.  Last week, my hard drive crashed.  I bought another and installed OS 10.9.  Everything works.  I do not, however, see the drive's icon on my desktop.  Therefore, I can't open it.  How can I fix this?  Re-booting doesn't fix it.  Thanks!  <answer126631> go to Finder  Preferences  General  Then select  Hard disks under "Show these items on the desktop:"
