Ichat - email not registered with iMessage <body> My family all has some type of mac devices, computers and phones.  We want a family page on iMessage, however when I try and use a gmail email account it says it is not registered with iMessages.  Can I fix this?  <comment319949> Is that the case for every Apple device you try it on?
