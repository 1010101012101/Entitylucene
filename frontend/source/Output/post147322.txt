How to updated OS X theme so it looks like iOS 7 design <body> I saw few people have fancy OS X design that resemble iOS 7 design. I did not find any official information about it on Apple site about Mavericks. Though this theme appears at new Xcode page. I updated OS X but I did not get this design .. and I did not find a way to apply this design via Systems Preferences.  So how would I change my Maverics design?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfYvR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer147323> This is OS X Yosemite, the next version of OS X.   <comment173695> is it possible to install it already? I saw guy was using it. Probably there are some alpha versions... <comment173697> @putinhuylo  go to https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/
