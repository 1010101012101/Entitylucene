How do I change the color in Terminal indicating the use of a dead key? <body> A dead key (a key that does not generate a complete character by itself but modifies the character generated by the key struck immediately after) is indicated with a yellow background to previous the final character.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwQCL.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's perfect when you write black on white, but not when you write white on black, like in some Terminal configurations.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OQ0A3.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is: Where can I change that color?  <answer176486> hr  strongold:/strong I don't know how to fix the dead keys, but there's a better solution (in my opinion), which avoids dead keys altogether. Check out my answer to the question: Accent popup in Terminal.app?.  If you don't like that approach, you might try to dig around in the file codeLibrary/Preferences/com.apple.Terminal.plist/code and see if you can find anything there that might be useful.  hr  strongedit:/strong emReading some of the comments on the original question, I see that this solution will not work for the OP, but I will still keep it as an answer in case anyone else might have this question and find the information useful./em  <answer176487> This isn't a clean fix, but here's a work around:  Keep the Terminal as Black on White but then go to:  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display &gt; Invert Colors /code/pre  Doing this will change your Terminal (and everything else) to White on Black, but also change the yellow dead key to blue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZTbp.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You can also turn Invert Colors on and off using a keyboard shortcut if you turn it on in the keyboard preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/647NP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment205967> What exactly are dead keys? Can you give an example of a dead key? When I press `command`, `ctrl` or any other modifying key there is no yellow background in my terminal. How do I activate 'dead' keys? Are they part of the text encoding? <comment205971> @CousinCocaine I think they mean like accent marks. The way to write Ã© if you don't want to hold down e and then select the character is to press Option-E and then press e. <comment205988> @user24601 yes it is (not for accent marks in my case, as I have a French swiss keyboard, but it for greek accent mark) <comment206066> I noticed that this is a system wide issue, it is not bound to the Terminal only. Another thing is that this feature is already present in 10.6.8. <comment206075> yes, it system wide issue. But the problem appears only on White to Black input... <comment206094> Would it be an alternative for you to rather use the accent popup [as described here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/155483/accent-popup-in-terminal-app)? <comment206097> no, accent popup stop typewriting, and i have to much accent to stop... <comment206961> I don't know whether that color can be changed, but I can tell you that it doesn't happen in iTerm2. <comment206968> I didn't know it. I will try ;) <comment207101> @JayThompson for now iterm2 is doing what I need. I have just to find a French translation. <comment208449> indeed, that's not stupid, but as many time I use terminal in the same I use other software I want to be white on black... iterm2 is for now the better solution.
