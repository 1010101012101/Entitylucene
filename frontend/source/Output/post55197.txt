Can I copy a recovery partition from an HD to an SSD? <body> I installed an SSD in the optical bay of my mid-2009 MacBook Pro. I formatted it and copied most of the files from my HD and it works fine but wound up having no Recovery partition. I followed the instructions at How can I create or recreate a Lion recovery partition? but at the end of the process I get this error:  precodeError (async): File system check on boot helper partition failed (-69840) /code/pre  codediskutil list/code shows me this:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SteveBook2 SSD          239.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot                         650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *750.2 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS SteveBook2 HD           749.3 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3 /code/pre  So it looks like the SSD has a partition, but the Recovery HD is not installed. Is there any way to copy the Recovery partition from the HD to the SSD? I tried using Carbon Copy Cloner but got this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BIHj8.png" alt="Carbon Copy Cloner screenshot"  I'm really hoping to be able to activate Find My Mac.  <answer55427> Ok, I figured it out.  ol liWhat are the purposes and safety to enable the hidden debug menu in Disk Utility?/li liMount both recovery partitions/li liSelect the HD's recovery partition and use Disk Utility's strongRestore/strong function to copy it to the SSD's recovery partition/li liBoot from a USB drive and use the gpt remove/add commands as described at Dmitry Dulepov's blog to change the recovery partition's type from Apple_HFS to Apple_Boot.
