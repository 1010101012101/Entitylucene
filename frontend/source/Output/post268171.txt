What's the meaning of the exclamation point in the triangle next to my Calendars? <body> System details:br OSX 10.11.6 (15G1212)br Calendar Version 8.0 (2092.3)  I have a few Calendar subscriptions shared between my Mac and iPhone, including a few shared with multiple people.  I noticed that on my Mac, when I open Calendar, there are 'exclamation point in a triangle' icons next to two of my groups of calendars.    What are these icons indicating?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KJnaIm.png" alt="Calendar Screenshot with Icons"  <comment336569> That indicates a communication/sync problem.  Try deleting those calendars and re-add them.  That usually solves it.
