Folders disappeared from iCloud Drive following path name change <body> So that GNU Make could access my iCloud Drive folder, I removed the space in 'Mobile Documents'.  So I changed my iCloud Drive path from:  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/ /code/pre  to  precode~/Library/MobileDocuments/ /code/pre  As far as I can tell, my Mac has automatically re-created code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code (ie, it has re-created my iCloud Drive folder).  On my Mac, the only folders that are now showing in code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code are Preview, Numbers and Pages (ie osx and iOS apps).  On my iPhone, I can access my iCloud Drive folder in all apps, but the only apps in which files are syncing via iCloud are Preview, Numbers and Pages. In apps such as Textastic, which I only have installed on my iPhone, the files are no longer syncing via iCloud.  All my apps and their files that were previously in code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code are present in code~/Library/MobileDocuments//code. Therefore, I tried transfering apps and their files present in code~/Library/MobileDocuments//code to code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code, but my Mac said the files are all present in code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code, even though they are not showing.  Can anyone tell how I can revert my changes? Therefore, how can I have all apps and their files returned to iCloud Drive and syncing using iCloud?   <answer179939> Doing things from the code~/Lbrary//code is dangerous, try this:  ol liI would first move all the documents from code~/Library/MobileDocuments//code to your desktop so they are no longer considered iCloud files./li liDelete the code~/Library/MobileDocuments//code folder./li liDelete any and all files from iCloud Drive as normal, not from the Mobile Documents folder. /li liWait a hour or so, then copy the files from your Desktop back into iCloud Drive, again, using the standard method./li /ol
