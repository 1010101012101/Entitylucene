Why does my brew installation not work? <body> I installed brew before, but it does not work now.  When I run codebrew/code, it gives me the error code-bash: brew: command not found/code  So I tried to reinstall using the code   precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  But it gives me another one :     It appears Homebrew is already installed. If your intent is to reinstall you   should do the following before running this installer again:   rm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup   If I use the command coderm -rf /usr/local/Cellar /usr/local/.git &amp;&amp; brew cleanup/code, it gives back the first error : code-bash: brew: command not found/code  What should I do now?  <answer148919> "Command not found" indicates that the codebrew/code binary isn't on one of the directories listed in your PATH environment variable. To check what your path is currently, run codeecho $PATH/code. By default, brew installs to code/usr/local/bin/code. To set the path permanently, you should edit your code~/.bashrc/code file to contain the line codeexport PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"/code.   <answer226696> The FAQ has a section on this and a specific uninstall script, start there to get a clean system and then install again.  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/FAQ.md     To uninstall Homebrew, paste the command below in a terminal prompt.      ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"      Download the uninstall script and run ./uninstall --help to view more uninstall options.   <comment175391> What is your $PATH <comment175397> and check permissions. <comment175477> yes, I already did it. <comment268565> Piping curl to bash/executable prompt.... ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHH <comment268566> Find who specified that as a good idea, and please hit them for me. <comment275289> did you also rebooted your mac? this is mandatory after changes in bash/bashrc/bash_profile <comment275291> @FakeName Its at the top of the Hombrew page so the same people who thought it best to chnage the permissions on /usr/local to one user out of many. It is the idea to make it simpler to do things. <comment275292> @Alessiox no it is not necessary to reboot the mac - only need to start a new Terminal and run from there (or even on most cases resource ~/.bash_profile
