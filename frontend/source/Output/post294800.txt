Brand new MacBook Pro touch bar F4 trouble <body> Just a couple of days into owning a new MacBook Pro (14,3) It seems the f4 key doesn't work if iTunes is open - I searched a bit and people were having this issue in January - Is there a fix / workaround (other than quitting iTunes) ?  It disables f4 on external keyboards too, and takes approx. 30 seconds after iTunes has quit to function correctly again.  100 % reproducible - can't imagine that this has been left unsolved for this many months. any ideas ? thanks !
