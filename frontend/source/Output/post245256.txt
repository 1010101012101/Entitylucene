Xcode 7.2.1 Supporting Files folder missing <body> I am on OS X 10.11.5  and Supporting Files folder is missing  I am following tutorials and they all have that but not in mine  I already tired recreating new projects but it's missing in all of them  Project Creation 1. File  New  Project  iOS .

For Objective-C-based projects, the folder usually contains codemain.m/code and maybe codeInfo.plist/code (with related codestrings/code files).  You can always create your own group named codeSupporting Files/code and put whatever you want into it.  (Note: the codeSupporting Files/code entry never was an actual strongFolder/strong, just a strongGroup/strong in Xcode)
