How to add Folder Actions in Mountain Lion <body> I'm trying to add an Apple Script to my Download directory. From what I read on the Internet I need to copy the script to Macintosh HD - Libraries - Scripts - Folder Action Scripts - however, I don't see this directory on ML, what should I do?  Thanks.  <answer58146> You need to drag it into your personal library, not the system-wide.  ul liSwitch to Finder/li likbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd and enter code~/Library/Scripts/code to open a Finder window/li liIn case there isn't a codeFolder Action Scripts/code folder inside the newly opened window, just create one manually/li liCopy the folder action scripts into the folder called codeFolder Action Scripts/code/li /ul  <comment66871> I don't have the directory ~/Library/Scripts :( <comment66872> Then create this folder as well by just going to `~/Library` in step 2. <comment66873> OK, let me try this. <comment66878> ~/Library is hidden in Finder, you can (among other ways) access it by using kbdShift-Cmd-G/kbd. And yes, your folder actions should be in your home folder (you don't have write access to `/Library/...` anyway). <comment66879> OK, copied it and I can see it in Finder. Now I want to be able to link it to my ~/Downloads folder, I went into Finder Action Setup of ~/Downloads folder, but I can't find the script in the list - what should I do? <comment66881> And what did you mean by "In case there isn't a Folder Action Scripts folder yes, just create one manually"? Isn't the creation of ~/Library/Scripts replaces this? <comment66886> The full path is `~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts` so if `Scripts` missing create both `Scripts` and (inside the newly created folder) `Folder Action Scripts`. Your folder actions then need to be copied into `Folder Action Scripts` <comment66912> You're the MAN! it worked! Thanks! :-)
