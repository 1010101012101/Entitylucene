Highlighting in Preview not visible in other software <body> h3Is there a way to make highlighting done in Preview visible in other software?/h3  In particular interested in whether it can be seen in Adobe Reader.  Really would like to avoid installing Adobe as it requires frequent updates and seems like a resource hog.  br I think this is essentially the reverse of this question: Different ways of displaying documents between Adobe Reader and Preview  <answer223450> I am not quite sure why you have problem seeing in other apps highlighting (and other annotations) made in Preview, but just in case: after you've made all your annotations including highlights, press Cmd + S or File - Save in Preview app. All your additions shall now be visible in any other apps.
