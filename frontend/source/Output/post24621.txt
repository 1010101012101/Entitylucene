How to increase font size of Eclipse globally? <body> I'd like to know how to increase the font size for Eclipse so it adjusts the whole GUI to not look so darn small on my screen.  For NetBeans there is the --font-size switch which can be set in netbeans.conf, is there something similar for Eclipse?  (In case it's useful, I'm on Snow Leopard.)  <answer24638> As far as I know, there's no way to increase the font globally. In Eclipse's emPreferences/em, navigate to General  Appearance  Colors and Fonts.  emDialog font/em is the font used in the dialogs, and emText Font/em used in text editors, etc.  I don't know how to increase the font for the rest of the GUI, though.  <answer35588> Go to Preferences  General  Appearance  Colors and Fonts, expand the "Basic" folder and select "Text Font" and change that to whatever size you like.   For Eclipse strongNeon/strong: To Increase Ctrl + To reduce Ctrl - for Macs, use the command key, not the control key  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqSsU.jpg" alt="shortcut for font eclipse"  <answer51670> Inside the Eclipse.app is a setting for the font size. To make the fonts globally larger edit Eclipse.app » Contents » Eclipse » eclipse.ini and remove the line   code-Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts/code  from the file. Save the file and restart Eclipse.  <answer191983> I have Eclipse installed in a Linux machine. A while ago I did a Linux update and it messed up the fonts on the entire system. All the fonts got larger. So, I went all over the place resizing the fonts for each application.  Guess what?! On the next Linux update, the fonts got back to normal. However, I had to go back and undo all the font resizing that I had previously done on every application. So, when it came time to reset the fonts in Eclipse, I couldn't remember exactly what I did. I went to the following location:  precodeWindow &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Colors and Fonts &gt; Basic &gt; Text Font &gt; Edit /code/pre  No matter what I did on this setting, the font remained the same.  I finally figured out what the problem was. I had also resized the fonts on the following location:  precodeWindow &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Colors and Fonts &gt; Structured Text Editors &gt; Structured Text Editor Text Font (overrides default: Text Font) &gt; Edit /code/pre  Once I edited this setting, the fonts on Eclipse went back to normal.  <answer242926> strongNOTE:/strong For those coming from Google, this change has no effect on later MacOS/Eclipse versions of El Capitan and Mars, respectively. See this related question: Yosemite: How do increase font size of Eclipse globally?  <answer245363> You go to colors and font and go to the java drop down and find java editor and edit the size and it should work as it has for me.  <answer258703> For eclipse luna : edit codeeclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.0.1.v20141126-1957/css/e4_default_gtk.css/code  and add at end of file :  precode* {   font-size:14; }  /code/pre  This will make eclipse keep same font if you switch workspaces  <answer288719> eclipse on Mac, for the font in the tools bar, you have to go to the system preference-display-resolution, and change the system font.  <comment27689> thank you, well it seems i still have to use netbeans <comment59050> @MichaelLange see my reply. <comment87221> This is a reasonable compromise for me.  Eclipse uses so much screen estate on GUI-fluff that this is the only reasonable way to get a lot of _information_ on there too. <comment172197> This actually helps, nice one! <comment183357> Great. This solves also the small size of the interface elements, like the Package Explorer. I was turning blind before... BTW, you know what's fine? I have such line in my eclipse.ini twice, one was commented out and the other not. I wonder why the did that... <comment209676> Does not work at all. I am using Kelper on yosemite. <comment243251> In Mars it's located in Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/eclipse.ini  Also, I found two lines in the .ini file that had this -D definition, so make sure to remove all of them before restart. <comment289621> This only changes the text font. It has no impact on the GUI globally as the OP asked. <comment289624> This should be the accepted answer. This is the only way to increase the GUI fonts in Eclipse on OS X that I've found. <comment302493> How does this improve on or differ to http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/35588/237 <comment304601> In Neon, the .ini file is also in `/Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/eclipse.ini` just like @andrewz commented. Also, there are two lines in the .ini file as well, which you have to remove. <comment326342> I can easily read my code now.  Thanks! <comment332668> Several items are duplicated in that file, in Neon.1 when installed by Oomph installer.-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8, -Dorg.eclipse.swt.internal.carbon.smallFonts, -XstartOnFirstThread. <comment333369> This setting doesn't change the font size with STS in macOS Sierra. <comment349332> I've edited `/Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.1.300.v20161107-1827/css/e4_basestyle.css` and it works on Sierra! <comment359998> Removing the smallfonts option from the eclipse.ini file worked fine for me in Neon on Sierra. Are you sure you removed both occurrences of the option from the file? <comment364641> This only changes the font used in the editor, not globally. <comment364667> `ctrl shift +` also works an was the only way for me to zoom in (eclipse 7.2) <comment366774> works with neon3 and Yosemite. The GUI font size increase was pretty minimal though. At first I though it didn't work. I literally had to take screenshots before/after to realize it did increase. I'd estimate the Package Explorer font went from 4pt to 6pt (from tiny to small). <comment366775> The font size increase is very subtle. Take a screenshot before/after and compare. <comment367963> There's also an application called RDM that let's you choose any screen resolution on Mac, I often use that as a fix for apps with too small fontsizes. Like setting my laptop screen to 1280 x 800 for example.
