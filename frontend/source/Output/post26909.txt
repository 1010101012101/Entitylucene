Prevent mobile Safari from loading the last page when started <body> Whenever I open Safari on both my iPhone and iPad, it starts loading the last webpage that I visited in the past, which is not very convenient.   Is there a way to stop it from doing this?  <answer26911> You could save a bookmark to about:blank (or your desired home page) as an icon in your home screen. Then click that to launch Safari rather than the Safari icon.  To do this:  ul liopen Safari./li liType the url codeabout:blank/code into the URL area and go to that page. The page will, unsurprisingly, be empty./li liPress the share button, and select "Add to Home Screen"/li liAssign a name to this blank page. In your case, you might want to call it Safari./li /ul  (Dan Frakes of MacWorld spells out these steps at http://www.macworld.com/article/159303/2011/04/ios_safari_blank_page.html; thanks to Heng-Cheong Leong for point this out).  Alternately, you could close any pages you had open in Safari before exiting the program.  <comment30750> What is your desired behavior instead of opening to the last page visited? Opening to a home page? A blank page? Your bookmarks? <comment30751> Good point: a blank page I guess, which leaves me free to navigate to whereever i want at that time. <comment30755> I am modifying my answer to reflect this information. <comment30777> Dan Frakes of Macworld.com have written a step-by-step guide on creating the "about:blank" home-screen bookmark at http://www.macworld.com/article/159303/2011/04/ios_safari_blank_page.html
