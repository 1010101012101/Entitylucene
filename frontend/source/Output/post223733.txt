Basically  ul liConnect the iPhone to your computer and launch iTunes/li liTurn the iPhone off (hold down the power button at the top of the iPhone)/li liHold down the sleep/power button and home button together for exactly 10 seconds, then release the power button/li liContinue to hold down the Home button until a message appears in iTunes telling you an iPhone in recover mode has been detected/li /ul  When you are in DFU mode your iPhone screen will be completely black. Even though the screen is black, that doesn’t mean the device can’t be interfaced with either iTunes or a custom firmware client (for jailbreaking, etc).
