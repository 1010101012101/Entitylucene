How can I stream to Airplay and Bluetooth simultaneously? <body> I have an iMac with airport express and I also have a logitech bluetooth speaker adapter.  Seemingly I cannot play through both at the same time.  I have even tried going to the MIDI settings and creating an 'aggregate' audio device but it just flips back after a few seconds of it being selected (to a working method)  EDIT: Snow Leopard 10.6.8  <comment116741> Did you try using the Multiple Output in MIDI ? <comment116751> I can't see where that option is. From screenshots I've seen, that might only be in later versions <comment116753> Sorry, I have the MIDI Version 3.0.5 on os 10.8.
