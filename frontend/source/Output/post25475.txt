Permanently pair Mac with iPhone <body> I have paired a new Macbook Air with my iPhone, however after the Mac is rebooted, it asks me to confirm pairing. Is this a bug in Lion, or can it be permanently paired?  Similar issue with a mouse, but solution didn't help me  Steps to reproduce  ol liSet up Bluetooth device, find iPhone, pair while having iPhone on the hotspot screen/li liDisconnect and connect to device. Works fine./li liReboot Mac/li liConnect to the device from the Bluetooth menu/li /ol  Dialog pops up asking for me to confirm pin. If iPhone is in hotspot screen, it will also pop-up a dialog. I have to tap pair on iPhone then it's back to normal. After that it works until next reboot.  hr  About system:  ul liOSX 10.7.1/li litried iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4/li limacbook air (mid-2011)/li /ul  <comment28832> Can you please edit your question to include how exactly you are trying to pair your iPhone and what version of iOS are running? It would help greatly in troubleshooting. In the meantime, go through Apple's article (it has a list of troubleshooting you can do) and see if it can resolve your problem: http://support.apple.com/kb/ts2756 <comment28835> I've updated question with more details.
