MEvent. Case! on Matlab running on Mac <body> When I try to two-finger scroll in a matlab window, I get the error  precodeMEvent.Case! /code/pre  The proposed solution (as posted on the Matlab forum) seems to work just fine for Matlab running on Linux  precode!synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=0 /code/pre  but it does not work for Matlab running on a Mac.  How can I get matlab to stop giving this error?  <answer249686> The synclient program is a command line tool for accessing Synaptics driver options in Linux, so that's only relevant if you're on a Linux system with a Synaptics touchpad.  On my Mac, I had this problem when using a Magic Mouse to access a Linux desktop remotely via NoMachine/NX. The Magic Mouse has no "button", but instead has a trackpad like surface that can register clicks, taps, swipes, etc. I use a third party tool called MagicPrefs for it (the key use in this context is to enable a "middle button click" effect for Linux), and I found that if I choose "Configure Scrolling" in MagicPrefs, and then disable ALL scrolling behaviors (1/2/3 finger) I no longer can trigger those "MEvent" alerts in MATLAB.  NOTE: disabling all scrolling disables the mousewheel-like scroll, and it turns out only disabling the horizontal/diagonal scrolling seems to be required to avoid the MATLAB issue.
