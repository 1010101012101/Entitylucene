How to recover from deleting Xcode CoreSimulator devices from disk? <body> By mistake I deleted code~/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/code from my Mac so all my Xcode simulators were deleted.  Now none of my Xcode projects run. When I try to, an alert shows that no simulator is selected in select device.  <answer231638> To get back to a vanilla state, quit Xcode, Simulator, Instruments, and any other CoreSimulator clients that you have and run:  precodesudo killall -9 com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService 2&gt; /dev/null rm -rf ~/Library/*/CoreSimulator /code/pre  <answer231641> You can add new simulators inside the Xcode. Simply press kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbd⇧ SHIFT/kbd+kbd2/kbd to open strongDevices/strong window. There on the lower left side you have small "code+/code".   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFFc3.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231774> Finally, I solve my problem by updating Xcode you can solve this problem..   <answer264689> You can download simulator from internet and add it in you Xcode package content or directly select option "DOWNLOAD SIMULATOR" from Xcode.  <comment282277> As I am not a developer I am guessing on this, but did you try re-installing X-Code?
