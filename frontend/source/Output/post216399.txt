Finder does not update <body> I have an issue in a folder were some files, that was recently put there by an installer, does not show in Finder. Files are not hidden (ls -Ol), they show in Terminal, and has the same file permissions as other files in the same folder. The only difference between the files are that they were recently put there by a .pkg installer.  To refresh the state of files in the folder, I need to use the search-function in Finder. After being searched for, the files become visible.  I looked through AD to check if there were others that has the same issue, but the only question I found was this -  Finder does not show files in folders and this What would cause normal files to be hidden from the Finder but not the terminal? - and the answers there did not solve my issue.  Did anyone see the same problem as I did and know how to solve it permanently without needing to use the search-function?  I use Yosemite 10.10.5.  <answer216404> I've heard of this happening before, but can't put my hands on a link right now.  Try this applescript, save it as an Appbr It refreshes the contents of all open Finder windows by switching them to another view then back again.  precodetell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view                   end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment261470> Do the files have a period in front of them? eg: ".MyFile" <comment261471> No, it seems like it could be any filename <comment261472> Ok, have you tried opening Terminal and typing this command?: chflags nohidden /path/to/hidden/file <comment261630> Thanks, but it did not change the visual state of the missing files in Finder. I did not know much about Apple Script - http://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/applescript/info and the Script Editor until now. So Good to learn something else on the way. <comment261632> Thanks for the suggestion @MorganR , but using the chflags utility did not help me. I did not know about the chflags utility. Nice to know if I want to change flags for files.
