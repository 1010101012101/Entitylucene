How to fix blank icons for Download and Documents stacks in the Dock <body> I'm getting blank icons for stacks (e.g. Downloads) and grids (e.g. Documents) in the Dock. Nothing seems to fix it. Have tried relaunching the Finder and even a full reboot, but nothing helps. Any ideas?   There's a question about exactly the same problem from a while back but that's no help as the OP said that upgrading to Mountain Lion fixed his problem.  I'm running Mavericks (10.9.2). Problem started recently, but I can't tie it definitely to the 10.9.2 update.  UPDATE: tried restarting the Dock and that got back 2 or 3 icons, nothing more.  Here's an example of the problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vbMNe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer129009> Try removing PDFs from the stack's contents. subSource/sub  If that doesn't work, try backing up and removing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist/code and relaunching the Dock (codekillall -HUP Dock/code).  <comment151099> Turned out it was a complex Excel spreadsheet in the Downloads folder that was causing the problem. Following the advice in the thread you linked to, the icons *would* appear if I left the stack open for long enough. Once I removed the .xls file, it all went back to normal. My guess is that Dock (or Finder) is taking too long trying to render a miniature version of the file. As you pointed out, this can happen with PDFs too.
