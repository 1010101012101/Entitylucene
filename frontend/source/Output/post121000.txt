Writing a shell script (or something similar) that will execute some commands <body> For my work I use an app called Sublime Text to edit website documents. To open my project in sublime text I drag the folder above the icon and it opens it up in sublime text.  My next step is to run a nodejs script, and after it's run open chrome and navigate to a local url.  My question is - how can I automate that process - meaning I will have a script that I run (command line is fine) that will open the project in sublime text, run the nodejs script (which starts a local web server), open safari to a url.  Is that possible?  Thanks  <answer121005> Yes, this is possible. The two best options for stitching together Mac applications are AppleScript and Automator.  Given your steps, consider exploring the included Automator application: strongApplications  Automator.app/strong  Apple's Mac Basics: Automator support note is a good starting point.  The following strongActions/strong are likely to help:  ul listrongDisplay Webpages/strong for opening your default browser and showing a URL/li listrongRun Shell Script/strong for interacting with node.js/li listrongOpen Finder Items/strong for opening documents in Sublime Text/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PGlPv.png" alt="Automator on OS X 10.9"  <answer121012> Something like this should be fine:  precodeopen -a /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/ Folder/ &amp;&amp; node script.js &amp;&amp; open http://localhost:80 /code/pre  Replace Folder/ with folder path and script to the nodejs script path.  <answer121038> You can write a bash script. Bash script is like windows batch file.  Here is a little example. Open sublime text and type in:  precode#!/bin/bash open -a "Sublime Text 2" node scriptname.js open -a "Safari" http://localhost /code/pre  Save it as script.sh  Then open the terminal and navigate to script folder. Type in next command and hit enter:  precodechmod u+x script.sh /code/pre  then run it:  precode./script.sh /code/pre  More at bash scripts here and here.  <answer123807> You can save the script with a .command extension: this gives you a file you can "double-click" to open it as an application.  Both way's (use .sh or .command as an extension), you have to make the script executable with chmod in Terminal: codechmod u+x ~/MyScript.sh/code.  <comment141071> how do I run this? is there some batch file for mac? <comment141145> Simply paste it in Terminal, or as already explained in the other answer save it in a .sh file.
