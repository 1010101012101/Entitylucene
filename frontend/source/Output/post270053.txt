Can I resume uploading with Google Photos after formatting? <body> My Macbook Pro (Mid 2012) became incredibly slow and I want to make a clean install of macOS Sierra.  I currently have macOS Sierra installed and I ordered Crucial 8GB RAM + Crucial 525GB SSD.  I use the Mac Google Photos client to upload regularly. So now what happens if I format, clean install and then restore my Photo Library?  Is there a way to make it continue with only new photos? Maybe I can backup Google Photos client's settings (which I don't know where are they) so it can be aware of the photos which are already uploaded?  So the Mac is still the main repository of Photos; we use it to unload our phones.  I have more than 125GB photos/videos there and I don't want to upload them all again.  What is the best thing to do to have a clean fast macOS without having to delete Google Photos and upload the whole thing again?  Thanks.  <comment339325> Hi there, current specs of machine could assist in the diagnosis of the issue.
