Slow Terminal on Sierra <body> The strongTerminal app is slow at reacting to input/strong, lag is very noticeable when I press and hold Enter. When I type codebash/code to create a sub-shell it becomes much faster.  I believe this behavior started when I updated to Sierra, but I might be wrong.  Does anyone know why this happens?  <answer282891> I noticed the same effect on Sierra. I discovered a simple solution: the response time improved when I decreased Scrollback (in TerminalPreferencesWindow) from "limit to available memory" to "limit of number of rows to (200 or whatever)"  <comment338958> Do you have any logs or error messages in the console when you open Terminal? This could help diagnose the problem. <comment356553> Although this solution works it looses fuctinnality I use a lot. <comment360084> It's still extremely slow after this solution for me, but definitely noticeably faster than it was.  Thanks for the tip!
