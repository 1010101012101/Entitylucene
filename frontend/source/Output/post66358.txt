Enabling Apache in Mac OS X Mountaion Lion <body> This is my first Mac, it's Mountain Lion, and I know how to enable Apache through Preferences - Sharing - Web Sharing, but how the hell do I do it in Mountain Lion?  I find that that button no longer exists, so what's the Ternimal command to turn it on manually?  <answer66361> To start apachebr codesudo apachectl start/code  This will give you a basic Apache server with a DocumentRoot at  code/Library/WebServer/Documents//code  You can enable things like PHP and virtualhosts by making use of the configuration file, which must be edited as root:br code/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/code  Restart the apache server (like after editing the config file) withbr codesudo apachectl graceful/code  Stop the apache serverbr codesudo apachectl graceful-stop/code  I believe in order to use user directories (like allowing code~/Sites//code to be accessed at codehttp://localhost/~username//code) or to get httpd to run at startup, you will need to do a little tweaking. I unfortunately can't test how easy it is to get the full functionality of the previous versions back since my Apache configs did not come from a "clean" 10.8 install.  <answer85014> To make it permanent you can do this:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist /code/pre  the '-w' option sets it to restart the service on rebooting etc.  <comment78065> Awesome! This is more than enough! Thanks a lot. :) If you do find out how to configure the use of `~/Sites/` then please tell me. ;) <comment78067> Some preliminary poking seems to indicate it has to do with making sure mod_userdir is active and that `/etc/apache2/extras/httpd-userdir.conf` is being properly imported at the end of the main configuration file. If `~/Sites` already exists, that _may_ be all you have to do... <comment78114> OK, I'll check it out then, thanks for all your help. :) <comment78127> The only thing that changed when I unpgraded was my custom *.conf directory was nixed from the /private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf file. I ran `/httpd -S` from Terminal and it pointed out the error of my ways.
