Within Terminal, `date` command outputs a curious prefix where it should'n <body> I am using a Mac Mini running Lion (10.7.5) and zsh 4.3.12 (i386-apple-darwin11.0.1) with oh-my-zsh installed. In the Terminal.app I retrieve the UNIX timestamp using the following command  precodedate +%s /code/pre  It should print out a string of decimal digits - as the time of writing code1357294199/code, however it prints code27m1357294199/code. Notice the code27m/codeprefix. It stays constant aka. does not change with time.  I already tried the following but to no avail  ul liClosed and reopened the Terminal.app/li liRestarted my computer/li /ul  Why does the codedate/code command print this extra prefix and how do I get rid of it?  hr  strongFollow-ups/strong (Note: For the sake of simplicity outputs will use a constant timestamp)  ul liThe command codedate '+%s'/code outputs code27m'1357294199/code/li liCommand code/bin/echo Hello World/code prints codeHello World/code/li licodetype date/code gives codedate is /bin/date/code/li licode/bin/date +%s/code prints code27m'1357294199/code/li /ul  <answer76760> The issue was due to a bug in oh-my-zsh:  ol liThe bug was fixed several months ago: update oh-my-zsh and the issue should be solved./li liIf for any reason you cannot update there is fix on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12321564/date-command-with-zsh) but it involves the editing of codelib/termsupport.zsh/code: remove the 12th line (warning I do not have oh-my-zsh installed and cannot check if the line number is really the correct one)./li /ol  <comment88988> What happens if you run it as `date '+%s`? And what does `/bin/echo Hello World` display? If they show the same problem, try `PS1= date +%s`. <comment88995> patrix, please find the information you requested in the follow-up section as also more about the shell I use <comment88997> Can you tell us the output of `type date`? And can you try `/bin/date +%s`? <comment88998> Matteo, please find the output in follow-ups <comment89002> Which version of oh-my-zsh are you using? The issue was solved several month ago: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/57 <comment89003> Updating to the latest version of oh-my-zsh resolved the problem.
