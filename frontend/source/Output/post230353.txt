How to list the manual sections <body> On my OS X Yosemite, when running codeman man/code I was excepting to see a list of codeMANUAL SECTIONS/code and their number, but I don't. As a Windows user until lately, I'm not familiar with the meaning of the different section numbers that are printed in parenthesis next to the command name.  So how do I list them?  <answer230360> Such information on OS X is instead located in codeman manpages/code, which is also available online here:     strongMANUAL PAGE SECTIONS/strong      The manual is divided into sections. Each section covers a particular subject area. The major manual page sections are:      1      General User Commands      2      System Calls      3      Library Routines (*)      4      Special Files and Sockets      5      File formats and Conventions      6      Games and Fun Stuff      7      Miscellaneous Documentation      8      System Administration      9      Kernel and Programming Style      n      Tcl/Tk   Run codeman manpages/code in Terminal or open that link to read more in-depth information.
