Is there a way to convert dimensions to inches in OS X? <body> When I Get Info on a pdf or an image it gives me the dimensions in points, which is great. I need to know how big an image would be, at full size, in inches. Is there somewhere in OS X where that info is available? I found this question where you can get that info via Preview, but having to open each file is painful.   <answer166816> Open the file in Preview. Press codecommand/code + I to open the Inspector window. You'll find the DPI of the image.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7w5Z.png" alt="General Info Tab of the Inspector"  You should get the required DPI in of the image.  Now launch Spotlight and divide image size in each dimension with the DPI. You should get your answer.  <answer166824> If you use the Preview to open that PDF or Pic then you can look up the original dimensions in Inches.  In Preview go to Tools- Adjust Size  By default it will be in pixels, but just click on the Units and select Inches.  Now it will show the actual size of the original image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giiI1.jpg" alt="Preview size"  <comment195675> He stated that he doesn't want to open files in Preview so this doesn't answer his question. <comment195839> Thanks, but looking for something  in OS X where that info is available. Having to open each file in Preview is a bit painful with more than a few files.
