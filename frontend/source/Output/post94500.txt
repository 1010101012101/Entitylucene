Portable Firefox for Mac <body> If some person tells me how to have a nice portable Firefox on my Mac, this person will have my eternal gratitude.  <answer94545> While I have written a portable version of Google Chrome for Windows, Chrome and Firefox have similar file structure, I'll give this semi tutorial a go..  First, copy your /Applications/Firefox.app to a folder named "Firefox" on a flash drive.  Now, locate a valid user profile for Firefox on your Mac (usually ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/ or  ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ )  Copy a valid profile folder to this "Firefox" folder also.  Next, we will create a Bash script to properly open Portable Firefox, so..  Inside this "Firefox" folder create a "start.sh" with the following lines:  precode /Volumes/&lt;FLASHDRIVENAME&gt;/Firefox/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox -profile /Volumes/&lt;FLASHDRIVENAME&gt;/Firefox/&lt;profile folder&gt; /code/pre  If you execute   precode$ bash /Volumes/&lt;FLASHDRIVENAME&gt;/Firefox/start.sh /code/pre  You should be able to run Firefox on any Mac anywhere.  NOTE: Replace &lt; FLASHDRIVENAME  with the mountable name of your flash drive.  <answer100923> The version Firefox v22 for Mac at http://portableapps.com/node/37665 is stable.  I use it and it works great.    <comment110804> Would this do the job? http://www.freesmug.org/portableapps:firefox <comment110806> @Alex — Alas, no. This link currently has a Firefox 4. Too old for me. We are at the Firefox 20s now.
