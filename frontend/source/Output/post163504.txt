Can I use my 128GB macbook air to temporarily run a 512GB / 1TB back-up? <body> I was thinking what I would do if my macbook pro with 512gb storage failed, the technical service delays would certainly disrupt my workflow severely  I have a macbook air that I use seldomly, in addition to my main macbook pro (the macbook air is my previous macbook)  Is it possible to:  ol liConnect a 512GB external HDD to the macbook air/li liRestore the time machine backup to the macbook air's external hdd/li liUse the macbook air for a while/li liGet another time machine backup from the temporary external hdd setup/li liRestore the time machine backup of (4) to the macbook pro when it arrives from the technical service - therefore restoring the original functionality/setup/li /ol  The steps (2) and (5) are the issue here, as I haven't done any macos restore's and don't know about the process  <comment191469> 2- restore to-select external drive. <comment191470> 4- create new backup to external drive. 5 -use restore with repaired mac and restore to it! If you have same os x on both no problem at all.
