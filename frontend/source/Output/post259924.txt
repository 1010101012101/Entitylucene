iMessage "Start New Conversations From" options different on iPad than iPhone <body> All of a sudden my iPad sends messages showing an email that I never use. For years it worked the same as my phone. Does anyone know how to correct this? When I go to settings, and click on send and receive on my iPad, it now shows 3 email addresses and not phone number. If I sign out, it will not let me send any messages without signing in, using my Apple ID.  <answer259959> The setting you are talking about can be found in     Settings  Messages  Start new conversations from   This will only work if you have signed in with the same Apple ID on both- the iPad and the iPhone.   If you cannot get it to work, try signing out of both devices and signing back in.   <comment325278> I'm struggling to understand how an iPad could have a phone number... "You can be reached at..." Yes. "Send from..." No. <comment325442> @Tetsujin See https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201349#ios. You can set up...tethering, for lack of a better word, so that messages sent from non-iPhone devices are sent from the phone number of the iPhone, to maintain continuity.
