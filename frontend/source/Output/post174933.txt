How to re-enable sync of Microsoft Exchange contacts in Yosemite? <body> About 2 weeks ago, I noticed that my Mac Mail on Yosemite no longer fetches contact information from my Exchange contacts when suggesting email address autocompletes. Under "Internet Accounts" in System Preferences, the Contacts check box automatically unchecks itself whenever I check it. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yr1kH.png" alt="Internet Accounts screenshot" How do I re-enable the sync?
