Cannot control Mac with steam controller while steam is running <body> If I plug my steam controller into my Mac, I can move the mouse, click, right-click, use the arrow keys, and type enter and tab. When I open steam, it stops working. The controller behaves as it should, and I can use it in big picture, but I can't move the mouse with the controller or type anything. I granted Steam accessibility permissions, and it still doesn't work. How do I fix it?  <comment347859> Do you guys know what stack exchange site it should go on then?
