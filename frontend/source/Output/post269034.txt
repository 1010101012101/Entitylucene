Regenerate OpenSSH Host Keys <body> How should I regenerate ssh keys for OSX? The system is running El Capitan if that is relevant information.   (To clarify, I am not asking for codessh-keygen  remote-server/code as a USER but to change the keys inside the serverside-sshd). In Ubuntu-Linux you delete  code/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*/code and codedpkg-reconfigure openssh-server/code.  <answer269048> In Mac, you should be able to delete the code/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*/code too and run codessh-keygen -A/code, which will generate the missing keys.
