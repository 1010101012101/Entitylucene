MacBook is constantly accessing Time Machine disk <body> I thought it was the HVAC system -- it goes on and off once per minute about 1440 times per day.  Then I realized it is actually the external hard drive connected to a MacBook Pro upstairs. The laptop is sleeping. (Whatever happens by default when you walk away from the computer.) The hard drive is configured as an external Time Machine disk.  How can I reduce this unnecessary noise in the house? This is my dad's computer so any "turn it off when you're not using it" solution will surely lead to lost backups.
