SCPlugin icons and menu <body> I installed SCPlugin on my mac for subversion. It works fine but I don't see the icons show status of my files. And I don't have SCPlugin's options in my right click menu bar. Any idea how to fix these?  <answer37448> for the menu bar, there is a workaround that you can start from the top bar of your finder window. it's almost as good as with the right-click context menu.  http://scplugin.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=1525&amp;dsMessageId=2441924  Because of the invisible icons I am also searching for help.  <comment64279> While this may answer the question, [it is best](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to summarize the contents of the link and provide the link for reference.
