Text in cell with URL hidden <body> I'm trying to copy and paste a number (tracking number) from a UPS notification into a cell on Numbers.  I want the number to appear with the link hidden but it keeps pasting the entire URL in the cell.  Excel did this for me and I am new to numbers.  <answer229151> You must not use "copy link" when copying the tracking number. Instead use the text copy (cmd-c) command. If you do so, the number will be pasted, not the underlying link.
