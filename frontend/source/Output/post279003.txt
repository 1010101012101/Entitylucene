Make sure you're using DHCP and no DNS servers are hard coded. Also make sure you don't have some kind of proxy software or VPN running on your computer.  Edit: try connecting your phone via USB and choosing that connection when you turn on hotspot and see if it works  Edit2: original poster posted a screenshot showing a hard coded DNS server. I recommend clicking on all hard coded DNS servers, clicking minus, and removing them.  edit3: the other issue may not be the wifi, but the modem to your internet provider.  <answer285473> Try the following:  ol liOpen network preferences./li liSelect your WiFi card on the left./li liClick "Advanced"/li liClick "Proxies" tab. 5.Enable "Automatic Proxy Configuration"/li liClose Network Preferences/li liQuit Safari./li liReboot your Mac and try again./li /ol  <comment351166> There is no VPN on ATM and under my Configure IPv4, I'm using DHCP. There is no DNS hard coded severs I believe <comment351170> It works when my phone is connected via USB <comment351171> Definitely a config issue with your wifi network connection in settings. <comment351174> Can you post screenshots of all the tabs for your wifi connection under System Preferences? <comment352288> It's Wi-Fi, TCP/IP, DNS, WINS, 802.1x, Proxies, Hardware <comment352289> I don't need a list of them - I want to see a screenshot of each of their contents. Post them as an edit to the original question. <comment352290> The issue is I'm currently on my phone and no access to a computer so I can't insert photos :/ <comment352291> Ok - it will be impossible to make a more educated answer than I posted below until we can see the settings. apple is basically going to do the same if you call or take it in <comment352292> Hmm give me a few I'll try. I said the image is too big when I tried to use it <comment352293> https://imgur.com/a/RlsZW https://imgur.com/a/3XBp6 https://imgur.com/a/NBwHb https://imgur.com/a/PyUDl <comment352294> Hey, could only post two links on the main page so test is above ^ <comment352295> See that DNS server - 192.168.0.1? Click it and click the minus sign at the bottom. You'll see it turn from black to grey. That will fix your problem <comment352296> Hey, I am unable to do that. I can only press the minus button. I can't even click on the DNS server 192.168.0.1 <comment352297> When you say "internet is not working" - when you go into a browser and you see the status bar at the bottom when you try to load a website, which step is it hung up on? Connecting, Resolving host, etc.? <comment352298> On the browser it just keeps on loading while other applications don't work as well. Even if I use personal hotspot (4g) and connect, the internet doesn't work. <comment352299> It says DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET <comment352300> Also not sure if it helps, when I connect my phone, it charges but in settings it says iPhone USB not connected <comment352306> Ok hmmm once again the internet stopped working. Sba I call Apple help desk <comment352321> I have tried all way but nothing has resolved it. It works fine in recovery mode but any time else nothing. Any thing else I can do?
