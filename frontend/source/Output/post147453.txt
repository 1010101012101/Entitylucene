How can I extend the lock screen timeout in iOS? <body> This question is applicable to both iPads and iPhones: how do I extend the lock screen timeout? By that I mean the time from when I see the "slide to unlock" message to when the screen goes black again. Right now when I press a button to wake my device up, I have about four or five seconds to slide the screen to unlock, before it just goes dark again. I would like to extend this timeout if possible. How do I do it?  <answer147463> Without jailbreaking your iPhone there Is no option to change that.   <answer163964> iOS 8 Settings  General  Auto Lock  <answer207402> iOS settings  general  Battery  low power mode  off  iOS settings  general  Auto lock  <answer245627> You can only do it after jail breaking else it's not possible.   <answer264796> I have accidentally found that pushing the on/off button exactly as the lock screen is dimming will keep the lock screen lit. No idea how long it stays on but doing this does prolong lock screen. It lasts at least 6 minutes and possibly forever. I am on iPhone 7. No idea how to set a timer for it though.  <answer267662> Pressing the on/off button as the screen begins to dim is indeed the solution to this "irritation," as first suggested by Wdtony. I just got the iPhone 7 Plus, on which the lock screen dims about two seconds faster than on my iPhone 5, by my "one-one-thousand" reckoning. This also works for the iPhone 5, so presumedly, it also works for the "6" line of iPhones.   <answer272061> Could not find Auto-Lock, search box took me to Display &amp; Brightness and it's there.  You can set to 2, 5, 10,or 15 minutes, or Never.  <comment173849> The possible solution would be to jailbreak the iPad's and iPhones if you need to customize according to your will. <comment302858> Welcome to Ask Different.
