This Apple ID is valid but is not an iCloud account <body> I have reviewed the askdifferent question here: &quot;This Apple ID is valid but is not an iCloud account&quot;  - I hate to open a new question on this topic, but none of the answers or suggestions have worked for me.  I can login to iCloud.com using the ID and can access mail, etc. with no problems.  I have tried logging into iCloud in System Preferences and I get the error in the title.  I have tried adding the iCloud ID to the user in "Users and Groups" and also without the iCloud ID there and I get the same error.  I have rebooted multiple times.  I have applied all available security updates to the system.    I have run out of things to try...

I checked the other post you referenced and one obvious solution not mentioned was to reset your PRAM/NVRAM.  To do this:  ul liShut down your computer completely/li liSwitch it back on and quickly press and hold the kbdCommand/kbdkbdOption/kbdkbdP/kbdkbdR /kbd keys until you hear the startup chime a second time./li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac startup normally /li /ul  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  <comment323644> Thanks for your suggestion.  This is my mother's old macbook and I'll have to talk her through the reset (can't do it with remote desktop).  I'll report back the results. <comment323663> OK, had her do the pram reset and still the same result logging into iCloud.  I know the reset worked since she remarked at how loud the chime sound was than normal.  Unfortunately, I'm stuck again :( <comment323677> Ok, so is there anything your mum can think of that may coincide with this issue? Did she change a password? Did she update OS X Mavericks recently? Anything else she can think of? Also, it's not clear from your question, was she able to log in previously on the MacBook Pro?
