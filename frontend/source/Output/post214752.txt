How to delete original partition <body> I have a question regarding deletion of partitions on a Mac.  Due to some performance issues, I decided to start fresh and created a new partition (NewOSX) on the hard drive, to which I have transferred all the data that I need from my old, original partition (MacintoshHD) along with installing an operating system, downloading apps, etc.  I would now like to go ahead and delete the old partition and merge the disk space into my new setup.  I know this isn’t as simple as deleting the newer partition would be, as the minus sign in the disk utility partition menu is greyed out.    Here is the info of the two partitions that I am referring to:    precodeMacintosh HD          Capacity: 119.2 GB         Used:     47.54 GB          Device:   disk0s2                       NewOSX                     Capacity:  129.35 GB            Used:      34.69  GB                               Device:    disk0s4                            /code/pre  I am wondering if there is (hopefully) a less than super-technical workaround that can accomplish this task.  Thank you.   Note: Though there is 47 GB still on the old partition (MacintoshHD), I no longer need anything from it and it is ready to be wiped clean.  Also, both partitions are running the “El Capitan” operating system.   precodediskutil cs list   No CoreStorage logical volume groups found   sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0   start            size  index  contents             0          1         PMBR             1          1         Pri GPT header             2         32         Pri GPT table            34          6                     40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B        409640  232811696      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     233221336    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     234490872  252636720      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     487127592    1269536      5  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC     488397128          7              488397135         32         Sec GPT table     488397167          1         Sec GPT header   /code/pre  hr  strongUpdate/strong  After having some trouble with Internet Recovery Mode and seeing my system crash a few times during reboot, I decided I didn't want to take any risks and mess around with Recovery HDs at all.  What I ended up doing was wiping Macintosh HD clean, reinstalling the operating system, and then took a few hours to manually transfer data, redo settings, etc., from NewOSX to Macintosh HD.  Then went to disk utility and deleted the NewOSX partition, which of course is a simple procedure.  Thanks for the assistance, wish I had realized the simple solution earlier.    <answer214816> You can do this pretty easily in Disk Utility. Select the hard drive in question (highlighted in blue in this image):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gNtRO.png" alt="disk utility"  and click Partition in the top toolbar. Then select the partition you want to delete, and delete it by clicking the "-" button.  <answer214820> You have several options depending on your resources:  You may either use a Time Machine backup drive/volume (size: at least the used size of emNewOSX/em ~35 GB) or boot to an external disk or Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd and restore disk disk0s4 to disk0s2.  strongRequirements:/strong  ul lia working Internet Recovery Mode/li liand/or a working Recovery HD/li liand/or external drive/li /ul  strongTime Machine method:/strong  ul liBoot to emNewOSX/em (disk0s4) and attach a backup drive.

Why not just back up your data and wipe the entire partition? I suppose if you want to learn how to move things around and you already have a bootable backup that you've tested, the plan of action you propose might be an interesting learning experience.  For anyone that's not sure they can pull off this, Apple posts supported instructions for a wipe and reinstall.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH18869/li /ul  It uses the Recovery Partition to perform the wipe. If you don't run caching server to keep fast access to the installer you downloaded, you can make a USB bootable drive to do the deed as well.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372/li /ul  These are supported and designed to avoid human errors. Also, it ensures you get a clean partition table with a supported Recovery HD partition for ongoing maintenance and efficient management of OS X.  <comment259364> Please open Terminal, enter `diskutil cs list` and `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` and add the result to your question by editing it. <comment259436> The "-" button in partition toolbar is greyed out for the partition that I am looking to delete. <comment259451> Thank you for the detailed response.  I will begin figuring out the time machine option as the second option appears a bit beyond my abilities at this point. <comment259489> Which kind of Mac do you have (e.g. iMac 2013 or MacBookPro10,1)? <comment259607> This is awesome! Despite my "don't do it" answer, it's fun to learn how things work under the hood and [pull a surprising stunt similar to a rabbit from a hat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGxq-c5ihSo) <comment259608> It was an older Macbook7,1 <comment259612> Ok, then the Internet Recovery Mode (and subsequently the Restore 2 method as well as the Time Machine method in my answer) don't work. This IRM requires at least a ~2012 model. <comment259614> Ok that makes sense.
