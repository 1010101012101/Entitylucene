How can I have a custom Pages page size? <body> I'm trying to select, in the Documents tab, an A2 paper size so that it represents better the information that I will be printing out. However, there is no A2 paper size. I am also aware that under the Printing dialog (Paper Handling), there are more document types, but still no A2 size.   Therefore, is there a way to make Pages visualise a custom paper size inside a document, and if yes, what is it?  Specs for reference: MacBook Pro (Retina, Early 2015) running OS X El Capitan v10.11.4 and Pages v5.6.2.  <answer238855> Using custom paper sizes actually falls to the printer driver, via the Page Setup window.  ol liIn Pages, select "Page Setup" from the File menu./li liClick the "Paper Size" menu, and way at the bottom, select "Manage Custom Sizes"./li liThis will present a window where you can define your page dimensions, give it a name, and save it for future use in the Page Setup window.
