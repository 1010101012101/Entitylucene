Crappy 3G USB dongles. Fix? <body> I'm currently using a 3G USB stick to get mobile internet to my mac. I use different kinds and this is the only way to get internet in some places. So I have to use them.  Most of these supply really crappy drivers and the current one (Quick net) crashes my laptop. strongIs there a way to sandbox the driver or something like that?/strong  I don't like the drivers because the lag when restarting, plug really deep into the system and are hard to remove.  <comment79586> Sandboxes don't prevent crashes, they primarily prevent applications from accessing too much data and ressources. <comment79765> sandbox of some kind will protect the OS. I don't care if the driver crashes.
