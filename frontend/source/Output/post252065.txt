Install 1.69f4 (SMC 1.7) on MacbookPro8,1 running Yosemite <body> My MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early 2011) (aka MacBookPro8,1) running OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite has just crossed the 1000 battery cycle count mark.  It now suffers from random shutdowns without me prompting anything. I am sure it is not a software problem.  What I have done:  ul lireset my SMC several times/li lichecked Console.app for code.panic/code files - none exists/li /ul  So I read further and found that Apple says upgrade your SMC to 1.69f4 (SMC 1.7). My current SMC version is strong1.68f99/strong. However, the update installer throws an alert:     The update is not supported by your system.   Turns out the system requirements are      OS X  10.7.5      OS X 10.8.2   but I am running Yosemite. Any advice?  <answer264625> any luck with your issue? I am having SMC related issues on my early 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro (aka MacBookPro8,1) too. Also want to update SMC to 1.69f4 but on Sierra I'm not allowed to.  Curiously, the description for this update on Apple's website doesn't specifically list the 13-inch model. Also curiously, digging into the .pkg file there are 4 other packages, named MacBookProSMCUpdate, MBP18, MBP91 and MBP92, which contain the SMC file for the following models, respectively:  ul liMacBookProSMCUpdate: 2010 17-inch MacBook Pro /li liMBP18: 2010 15-inch MacBook Pro/li liMBP91: 2011 15-inch MacBook Pro/li liMBP92: 2011 17-inch MacBook Pro/li /ul  This info was retrieved from the names of folders/files buried within payload files.  That all seems to indicate that, strongalthough this update is listed on Apple's website as for the early 2011 13-inch MacBook Pro,/strong the software inside is intended to use in other machines. Either that or Apple used totally inconsistent naming for the files and folder inside the package.  With some more digging, I found that I strongemCOULD/em/strong manually install an SMC update through an EFI command-line mode in rEFInd. I have not yet attempted that as I'm aware of the risks and don't want to finish bricking my Mac with a wrong SMC firmware.  So i guess my question is: emHas anyone with the same Mac model successfully updated its SMC firmware with version 1.7 (1.69f4) and can confirm that it is INDEED intended for this Mac model (MacbookPro8,1)?/em  If not, is there any other official word from Apple regarding the right number of the latest SMC update for this model?  Any hints are appreciated!  <comment313536> The KB says "This update is recommended for MacBook Pro (Mid 2010) and MacBook Pro (Early 2011) 15 and 17 inch models." Doesn't mention the 13". Did you check what Firmware you already have? <comment313629> @Tetsujin I current have a SMC version of **1.68f99** <comment331707> Whoops, disregard my previous comment (I misread your post). A less risky approach might be to install 10.7 to an external USB, then install the firmware update from there. You might also check that the EFI boot ROM is up to date, listed here alongside the SMC versions: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518 <comment331825> Thank you for the reply. I'll try that and post the results back here. <comment332105> I tried installing the SMC update from 10.7 and 10.8, to no success. The EFI boot ROM is up to date. I think my last resort is trying from the EFI command-line through rEFInd.Also considering replacing the battery (although I'm convinced that it's an SMC issue â€“ got the MacBook Pro to start up from the battery once, but can't tell how it happened) or taking it to repair (hope they don't make me buy a new logic board). <comment332480> hey @alvaroantonio i did suspect that Apple have some inconsistencies with the `.pkg`s. unfortunately my Mac's battery deteriorated further until it was impossible to not upgrade and so I bought a new battery for my Mac.  my SMC is still at 1.68f99 though <comment332561> hi @hongsy, after you replaced your battery is everything running smooth? does the mac recognise the battery? any problems related to SMC (fan running at full speed all the time, trouble reading battery status, key backlight not working)? I'm considering this may be the only solution now... <comment334523> hey @alvaroantonio, my mac recognises the new battery and there aren't any **new** SMC problems. unfortunately after the battery replacement, I still suffer from my old SMC problem although it is less noticeable. specifically my mac still suffer from unexpected shutdowns (roughly at 7% battery life)
