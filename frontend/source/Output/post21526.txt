How can I use shortcut keys for context menu items? <body> A common workflow on a Windows or Linux PC is to right click on a link in (say) Chrome, then hit "L" to copy the URL to the clipboard.  How can I achieve this on MacOS?  I don't want to have to use the mouse to select the relevant menu item.  <answer21530> This free app  http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/21559/shortcuts  Might help.  <answer21545> Context menus can be navigated in Safari with keyboard shortcuts. E.g pressing C - Enter will jump to copy link.  <comment23884> hmm.  Extra keypress ;-) Doesn't seme to work in Chrome anyway. Thanks. <comment23886> It works for me in Chrome (beta channel) under Lion. It works in all Cocoa apps.  I have to admit though, the implementation is a bit hit and miss and not every command has a keystroke.
