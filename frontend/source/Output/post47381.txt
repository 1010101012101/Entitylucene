Change Snow Leopard Login Wallpaper w/ Terminal <body> I know this is possible as I did it once before.  How do you set the login background wallpaper to something else using terminal?  <answer47385> The login screen background image is located at code/System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg/code â€” you can simply codesudo cp/code another jpeg image to replace it (though I'd recommend backing it up first!).  <answer48003> You can do it using AppleScript:  precodetell application "Finder"      set desktop picture to POSIX file "/path/to/file.jpg" end tell /code/pre  It should be fairly easy to package this in an Automator script.  Alternatively, you can use codedefaults/code:   precodedefaults write com.apple.desktop Background '{default = {ImageFilePath = "/Library/Desktop Pictures/Black &amp; White/Lightning.jpg"; };}' /code/pre  I haven't tested this myself, so you may have to run codekillall Dock/code before this takes effect.  Edit: more information on this and launchd  <comment55423> The question is now to change the login wallpaper, not the desktop wallpaper.  The script you provided only works for the desktop background.
