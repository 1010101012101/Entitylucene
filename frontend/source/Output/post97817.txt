Can I send and receive iMessage on Mac without buying an iPhone? <body> I have an Apple ID.  Macbook Air has iMessage installed.  But I cannot figure why I cannot send and receive iMessage to friends. I can only receive messages from myself.  Can you explain how iMessage will work on Mac?  Thanks.  <answer98519> I will answer my question myself.  This is easy to have a try. You can send an receive iMessage when you are online. To send a message, you only need to set the receiving address an codeApple ID/code, or some phone numbers related to the ID. Of course, you network must be well enough to connect to codeapple/code.
