Safely alter the plist on Calendar.app <body> I want to add code&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt;/code to the plist of Calendar.app like I would other apps because I don't want it in the dock or my task bar. This being a super-special Apple app, I need special permission. Could anyone tell me how to safely do this?  <answer179138> I would just make a copy of the original .plist on your desktop for example. Then copy it a second time, make your changes in this second copy and then drag and drop the edited .plist back to where it came from.   Try out Calendar and see if all is well, if not you can always drag the original copy on the desktop back to where it should be.  <answer179239> To safely alter the file just make a copy or backup of the file and then work with the original:  ul liTo modify the file log-in as a sudoer (usually an admin account) and open Terminal./li liEnter the following to backup the file:  precodesudo cp /Applications/Calendar/Contents/Info.plist /Applications/Calendar/Contents/Info.plist.backup /code/pre  you have to enter your password then./li liOpen nano to modify the plist content:  precodesudo nano /Applications/Calendar/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre/li linow add  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  after the line containing code&lt;dict&gt;/code (usually the 5th line)./li liHit kbdctrl/kbdkbdo/kbd to write the changes to file.
