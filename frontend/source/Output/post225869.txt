Understanding the lost mode "Find my iPhone" <body> So today my iPhone 6 got stolen, it has been off-line since then (10 hours ago), I have turned lost mode in "Find my iPhone".  I had a password (not the 4 digit BS) on the iPhone before...  What are the chances that it will be hacked before it will go online?, anyway I will wait a few more days and then I will wipe it.  Thanks   <answer225876> About the closest thing that could reasonably be expected to the iPhone being "hacked" would be the thief guessing the passcode, and since you said you have a strong passcode, that probably won't happen.  Because of this, you may as well hold off on wiping it; if the thief ever turns it back on you will see it in Find My iPhone and may have a chance of getting it back.
