Calendar application with Skype for Business integration <body> I'm looking for a decent calendar application for Mac with Skype for Business integration. I'm using an Exchange account for e-mail and calendar as well as Skype for Business for a chat and on-line video meetings. I schedule many on-line meetings and looking for an application (besides Outlook for Mac) that would allow easy integration. Another solution would be to schedule on-line meetings using Office365 portal but I don't want to do the same things in two different ways.  Thanks!
