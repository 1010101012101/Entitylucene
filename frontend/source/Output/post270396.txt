Migrating / Syncing iCloud Email to Exchange account <body> I'm trying to migrate all mails and folder from a IMAP email to a another. I selected all the folders and drag them to the new mailbox.  I can see some of the folder but not all the sub-folder, also when I check mailbox detail, the count is not the same.  the issue is I start moving some new mail to the new mailbox only.  How can I get the two mailbox completely synced ?  PS one is from iCloud, the another is from a exchange server.  <answer270409> I find the solution, it's was too obvious, but just Mailbox menu  Export mailbox   and then can move them to correct account :  ~/Library/Mail/V4  (or import them from the menu)
