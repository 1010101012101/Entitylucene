Apple script that closes Apple Remote Desktop <body> First let me say that I have ZERO experience in Apple Scripting. That said, I need to build a Apple Script or whatever is more efficient for that case, that is going to close Apple Remote Desktop after a certain amount of time. I want it to constantly run in the background and when the computer goes idle for 5 minutes, it closes Apple Remote Desktop.   The reason behind this is because we use several Mac workstation at work that are all connected to a network. When the TD department wants to vnc into one computer, Apple Remote Desktop must not be running. Otherwise it won't let us connect. So when our people are done working for a day and they omit to close all their apps, that script would do it for me.  Thanks!!  strongUPDATE/strong  We just found a simpler solution to achieve this. In the preferences of Apple Remote Desktop, in the Security tab, check "Allow control of this computer when this application is running"
