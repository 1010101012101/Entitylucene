Logging out and in resets modifier keys to defaults <body> ol liOpen Keyboard Preferences/li liSet modifier keys (I like to reverse option and command)/li liLog out/li liLog in/li liModifier keys have been reset to defaults/li /ol  I just upgraded from 10.7.5 to 10.8.2, might be related.  Every time I open Keyboard Preferences, I see the following in my console:     System Preferences[570]: [BluetoothHIDDevice][initWithHIDDevice] Unable to get Object ID from IORegistry   .. so that might be related.  <answer70947> ol liUninstalled Intellitype/li liRestarted in safe mode (hold shift)/li liUse Disk Utility to Repair Permissions/li liRestart/li /ol  Seems to have fixed the problem.  Perhaps some config file wasn't writable?  Who knows ..  <comment82014> Does it happen with other user? <comment82152> @Thecafremo yes.  I tried creating a new user and it happens with them as well.
