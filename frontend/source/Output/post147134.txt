Is it possible to schedule my laptop to mute and unmute based on calendar events? <body> I would like my mac (OSX 10.9) to automatically mute during meetings.  I have a fully abstracted calendar, with several sub calendars.   Any apps? Any Automator tricks?  <answer147138> h2Step 1: Automator tasks/h2  Create an Automator task, and save it (take note of the task file location). You probably want a couple Automator tasks in this case (one to mute and one to unmute).  Here's a very basic mute script:  precodeset volume output volume 0 /code/pre  And unmute:  precodeset volume output volume 100 /code/pre  After you've created both Automator task files,  h2Step 2: Scheduling with Calendar.app/h2  Go to Calendar, add an event when you want to mute. In the choices for the "alert", choose emcustom/em and then emOpen File/em. Choose the appropriate task file you created.  Do the same for the unmute event and task.  <answer147155> Open Automator app  Click on Calender and find and Drag the Find Calender Events  Select the Event has attendees! (obviously :) !  On left select the Utilities and find drag the set computer volume to the right.  Run a test in Automator to verify the Mute is activated, and save the file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehlyo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
