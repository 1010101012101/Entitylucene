Can I connect to my Linux server using "Go > Connect to Server"? <body> In Windows I use WinSCP. How can I do this?  <answer61547> It sounds like you're using (S)FTP to connect to your server. Finder doesn't support SFTP and supports read-only access for FTP. You can use Terminal and the command line SFTP client, or you'll need to use a 3rd party app like Cyberduck or Transmit to connect via FTP or SFTP.  The Finder supports AFP, SMB (Windows file sharing), NFS, VNC, and probably a few others I'm forgetting via the emConnect to Server/em window.  Details on supported protocols can be found in Finder Help  <answer61574> You can also use xdav via a command like https://[your xdav server]  Alternatively I recommend Expandrive which works quite transparently as a mounted disc. (The only issue if the disc is large is the possible indexation by Spotlight)  <comment71087> Connect to Server does support FTP. <comment75850> SSH file transfer protocols are SCP or SFTP, which (last I knew) are all that WinSCP supports. Hence the name, Windows Secure Copy. But you're right, The Finder will do standard FTP. <comment208570> @Alex Finder does read-only FTP. You can use the command line sftp client
