Get current client from Airfoil <body> At work we use a Mac mini running Airfoil as an endpoint to stream music through the speakers.  Ideally, I'd like to query that machine to ascertain the name or address of the current client streaming media to it.  I'm happy to do this from another machine on the network, or from an agent on the Mac mini itself. Is this possible?  <answer65968> I appreciate this is not ideal, but when a remote client connects to Airfoil Speakers on my machine, I see a line similar to the following generated in the Console, coming from code/var/log/appfirewall.log/code  precodeFirewall[85]: Allow Airfoil Speakers connecting from 192.168.1.72:52013 to port 5000 proto=6 /code/pre  So potentially you could codecat/code or codetail/code the codeappfirewall.log/code looking for "Airfoil Speakers" using something like  precodecat /var/log/appfirewall.log | grep -i "airfoil speakers connecting" /code/pre  and parse out the IP from the relevant lines.  Alternatively, I notice that Airfoil supports AppleScript so maybe there's something you could do with that. Or you could drop Rogue Ameoba an email, I've always found their support to be excellent.  <comment77529> Do you mean you're using _Airfoil Speakers_ on the endpoint Mac mini? <comment77593> Yes, sorry if that wasn't clear. I'm reasonably tech savvy as a developer, but the layers and layers of magic and abstraction that underpins this is making it quite hard to diagnose describe. I believe that's the technology in question. <comment77674> I might do just that. Thanks. I had a play with their AppleScript API and I suspect that I'm Doing It Wrong (tm). I'll have a look through the logs, hopefully it'll expose the data I need. thanks! <comment78258> Adding a link to the Airfoil software you are using may help others to better understand the context of your question. <comment78336> I'll see what I can find. We're using iTunes as the client in the office, to be honest I suspect that if the protocol isn't open enough that I can just make a query over bonjour what I'm after probably isn't achievable.
