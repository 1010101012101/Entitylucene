Activating iPad after factory reset with non-validated Apple ID <body> Trying to help a friend with an inherited iPad. The non-techie original owner created a Gmail account and a linked Apple ID special for the new iPad. While I can log into the Apple ID using the Gmail address/Apple password he sent on, I cannot log into the Gmail account (password unknown, no recovery address).  The Apple ID was never properly verified on the special Gmail account, and the iPad seemingly won't activate until the account gets verified.  If I update the Apple ID to use a different email address, will it still be possible to activate the iPad?  <comment252629> Well.... I was able to get into the iPad in the end, to my great surprise. I tried to log into iTunes with the unvalidated account. It didn't let me in. Then I tried to log into apple online with the account. It let me halfway in, but was waiting for email validation. Then when I turned off the iPad and turned it back on with iTunes running... the iPad was still requesting activation, but iTunes let me set it up no problem!
