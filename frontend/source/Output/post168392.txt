Partition issues after deleting Core Storage Logical Volume Group. Everything prompts an unmount error. HELP! <body> I followed the instructions on this link (last answer) to delete the Core Storage Logical Volume Group via terminal while pressing Cmd+R during startup. These are the functions I used in terminal:  precodediskutil cs list diskutil cs delete &lt;Logical Volume Group UUID&gt; /code/pre  Now I cannot resize the partition via Disk Utility. The post mentioned that a red error message would appear when selecting the drive, but that didn't happen.  I'm stuck!  When I try entering "diskutil cs list" in Terminal it returns:  precodeNo CoreStorage" logical volume groups found." /code/pre  These are screenshots from the errors in Disk Utility: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v3TgK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After resizing the top partition by dragging down and clicking "Apply", an error message prompts: "Couldn't unmount disk". Also happens after I repair the disk.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d1HwR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  When restarting the computer, a grey screen with error icon appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uF4y7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  <answer168398> Boot into Recovery Mode (hold down Command+R on startup) . Restore your computer or try to partion it through the Recovery HD.  <answer168562> I recommend:  ol liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by  pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into the recovery netboot image which is loaded from an apple server.  /li liIn the opening window choose 'Disk Utility' and erase/format/partition the internal drive. Choose '1 Partition' 'Mac OS Extended (Journaled)' and GUID partition table (available with the 'Option' button). Quit 'Disk Utility'./li liPlug in your Time Machine backup drive./li liStart 'Restore From Time Machine Backup' and recover your old system/li /ol  Instead of recovering your old system after step 2 you may install a new system by clicking on 'Reinstall OS X' and continue later with the steps 3. &amp; 4. and recover your personal data only:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/my0OW.jpg" alt="reinstall OS X"  <comment197682> When I try to Restore, it says that the Recovery HD is locked.  How would I partition through Recovery HD? <comment197752> Rule 1 - don't try to repartition your boot drive, whilst you're booted from it. <comment197848> Tetsujin: Instead of rephrasing the obvious lesson learned, do you have a solution? <comment197850> Try picking through http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/154964/resizing-or-expanding-a-corestorage-volume/154969#154969 or go for Internet Recovery <comment197856> @chrisshon You can't expect two red signed hdds after deleting the CoreStorage volume if you don't have an original or DIY-Fusion drive. Is your volume empty or does it contain some data or a system? <comment197859> @klanomath this is the original drive. What do you mean by "volume"? Before this occurred, I used Migration assistant to restore from a Time machine backup.  Im fine with losing all the data as I can always do another migration. <comment197866> @Tetsujin I was going through the link you posted, but when trying to create a disk image of 'Recovery HD' I get an error prompt: "The disk "Recovery HD" could not be unmounted. Please check that all applications and files are closed on this disk."  Also - When I enter "diskutil cs list" in terminal it returns "No CoreStorage" logical volume groups found." <comment198079> This worked!! Thank you so much!! <comment261052> I don't have time machine
