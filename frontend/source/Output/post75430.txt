Why doesn't tar recognize .iso files, even though the documentation says it should? <body> codeman tar/code says that OS X's codetar/code implementation should be able to extract .iso files.     tar creates and manipulates streaming archive files.  This implementation can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, and strongISO   9660/strong cdrom images and can create tar, pax, cpio, ar, and shar archives.   However, codetar/code gives me the following error:  precode$ tar -xvf test.iso tar: Unrecognized archive format tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors. /code/pre  What's with the discrepancy?  The .iso is created from a .dmg using Apple's codehdiutil/code utility.  codepoweriso/code can extract it without issue.  I'm on OS X 10.7.4.  codetar --version/code reports codebsdtar 2.8.3 - libarchive 2.8.3/code.  <answer75435> Chances are that it is not a pure ISO image so codetar/code may not recognize it. I have tested codetar/code on some random ISO images and it could handle them all, so it's likely specific to that particular image. Note that codehdiutil/code can create non-ISO CDR images so you would have to explicitly tell it to use the ISO format (note that the ISO format is somewhat restrictive, so many CDs use a different format either in addition to ISO or instead of it).  <comment87595> I used `hdiutil convert -format UDTO -o foo foo.dmg`.  I don't see any way to be more specific with the desired output format.  I will try to find some more .iso files to test. <comment87681> I tested it with a couple more files, and it silently failed for them.  There were no error messages, but it didn't extract anything.  Are you sure you're using the same version of `tar` and OS X as I?
