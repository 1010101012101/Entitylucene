How to usb tether a wifi network using iphone <body> I have installed windows 10 on my Mac and the Wi---Fi is interfering with the Bluetooth so I've turned off the Wi-Fi on the Mac.  My iPhone is connected to the Wi-Fi so I want to usb-tether the Wi-Fi to my mac through my iPhone.  But I have noticed that usb-tether is using cellular connection instead of Wi-Fi which costs me money.  Is there a way to usb-tether a Wi-Fi network instead of cellular network?  Android happily do this. After all it is common sense to tether the gateway.  <answer267652> The personal hotspot feature uses the cellular data connection. It's currently not possible to share the Wi-Fi connection from your iPhone without jailbreaking.  If your iPhone is jailbroken you can use Bridge Mode with MyWi.  <comment337698> Is there a jailbreak for iOS 10.2? <comment337703> @neckTwi Not currently, 10.1.x only
