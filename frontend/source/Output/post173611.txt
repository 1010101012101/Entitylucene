Sudo giving dyld problem. Help for a beginner <body> I am new to using a macbook terminal. Initially when I used the terminal for working on Raspberry Pi everything was great. But now when I try to use the terminal and type  sudo  it keeps giving a dyld message. And also rejects my commands. The message is :  dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/sudo) is setuid or setgid  Password:  what do I do? And why has this message started appearing all of a sudden?  Can anyone give a step by step guide on stopping this Thanks a lot:)  <answer197098> On the short term, within a codeTerminal/code enter:  precodeunset DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH /code/pre  and check that:  precode/usr/bin/sudo /code/pre  is working.  Your description let think of an installer which modified your working environment in closed relationship with the X11 environment.  To further analyze where this problem is coming, within a codeTerminal/code search which initialisation file might be working on this environment variable:  precodegrep DYLD ${HOME}/.profile ${HOME}/.bash_profile ${HOME}/.bashrc /code/pre  If you are using anything else than codesh/code or codebash/code as your working shell, search inside the equivalent initialisation files.  <comment204287> What do you mean it rejects your commands? Does that give you an error message too? That's certainly oddâ€”try running `env | grep '^DYLD'` and see what the output is. <comment204302> Did you set DYLD_ environment ? <comment206310> by reject i mean that it keeps displaying the dyld_environment message everytime I try to use sudo. <comment206311> I typed the command and the output was:DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11/lib:/usr/lib:: <comment206312> no I haven't set the environment. <comment235587> Add the information about your DYLD variable within your original question (\[edit] button).
