Wifi: not configured <body> I was removing a wifi network and after removing it, my wifi icon is blank, showing a cross over it, while i hover over it which says strongNot Configured/strong, I googled the problem but didn't find any solution to the problem, I tried reinstalling mavericks, while everything (user, setting and everything remain same) the problem remain same too. What can be the problem? How can I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RgB46.jpg" alt="wifi info"  and img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxDPm.jpg" alt="network info"  <answer135615> As even after installation, your hardware is not functioning, then it certainly HS. Do an Apple Hardware Test in advance mode (could take time)  <answer135622> Rather than removing a Wi-Fi network, it appears you've removed the Wi-Fi service. In OS X prior to 10.10, this means the AirPort shows Not Configured.  To allow configuration of AirPort, you need to add the Wi-Fi service back to the list of services:  ol liGo to System Preferences â†’ Network and click the strong+/strong button to add a service./li liSelect Wi-Fi as the Interface and provide a service name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FKnYY.png" width="422"/li /ol  This will allow configuration through the menu bar item.  <comment160732> Go to about my mac = more info = system report = Network = WiFi and post a print screen <comment160733> @Thomas I edited the question and posted a screenshot, not on PC but from mobile <comment160736> Thanks, could you also provide one with about my mac = more info = system report = Network ? <comment160738> @Thomas  I updated it <comment160831> @Georhe Garside it worked, thanks mate. Should I delete the screenshots from question as it MAC address? <comment160841> @Nofel No problem! You can if you want; it'll still be in the question's revision history though. Flag for a moderator if you want an older revision deleting. <comment369548> @grgarside It works well for macOS Sierra! Thanks a lot.
