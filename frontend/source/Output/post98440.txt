Terminal app no longer automatically recognizes functions in my ~/.profile any more <body> I made some function in my ~/.profile to automate things like SSH connections.  They were working fine until recently.  Now I need to "run" the ~/.profile by doing code. .profile/code each time I open Terminal for my functions to work.  How can fix this to make the functions available at start automatically?  I'm running Mountain Lion 10.8.4.    <answer98443> Does code~/.bash_profile/code exist?  If both code~/.bash_profile/code and code~/.profile/code exist, bash reads only code~/.bash_profile/code when it is invoked as an interactive login shell.  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html:     When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the code--login/code option, it first reads and executes commands from the file code/etc/profile/code, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for code~/.bash_profile/code, code~/.bash_login/code, and code~/.profile/code, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
