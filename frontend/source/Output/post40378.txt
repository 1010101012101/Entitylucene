How do I make Command+Tab only bring the active window for an application to the foreground? <body> When I switch to an application using kbd⌘ + tab/kbd, emall/em the open windows for that application are brought forward (usually covering other windows in other apps that I want to see). I would like only the active/selected window for that application brought forward. Is there a way to accomplish this?  I would be happy to change this globally, as the existing behavior drives me batty.  <answer40394> Apple's solution, like it or not, is to use Exposé or Mission Control (Lion) to switch between windows. kbd⌘ + tab/kbd is considered an application switcher.   There are third party solutions to change this behavior, but I don't have experience with them. There is some discussion about these solutions on this Super User question.  <comment45814> Well, this nails it (sigh). I wish Mission Control were easier to navigate quickly (= 2 keystrokes). Thanks for the pointers to the third party options; I'll check them out.
