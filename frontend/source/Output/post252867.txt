Does macOS Sierra support the new iMessage effects <body> I have the macOS Sierra final beta, but I seem to be unable to send or receive the new iMessage effects.  Such as the Invisible Ink:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gTSr3.png" alt="Invisible Ink"  Is it possible to view these effects on macOS Sierra currently? And if it is, how can I enable it?  <answer252874> Sierra doesn't support all the effects from iOS.  I don't have a definitive list from Apple and I haven't seen one on their site.  On my Sierra I'm missing all the backgrounds and text effects.  I can see any stickers sent to me.  <comment317380> Also, digital touch message don't appear, nor is there even any mention that they were sent. Tapbacks are converted to text: "Laughed at handwritten message" for instance
