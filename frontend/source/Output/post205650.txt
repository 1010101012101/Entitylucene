Send Wired Keyboard Keystrokes Through Bluetooth <body> I'm looking for a way send keystrokes from a strongwired/strong keyboard through bluetooth, preferably with an OS X application. I want to be able to type things on my iPad using this keyboard so I can quickly switch back and forth between it and my computer. Is there an OS X app that can do this?  Note that I'm running OS X 10.10.3 on a 2010 iMac.  <answer205651> h1Type2Phone - $9.99/h1  Any keystrokes you type while Type2Phone is focused will be sent over Bluetooth. You can Command+Tab to and from it as well.
