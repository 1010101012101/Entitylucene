fsck not working to fix corrupted external drive <body> I am using an early 2011 MacBook Pro with the Mavericks OS. I've researched a similar issue on an internal drive but As far as I know, being in Single User mode won't help my situation.   One of my external drives with all my photos stopped working - it does not mount, even though I see it in Disk Utility. Using DU I tried to verify and repair the disk and got this message:  'Invalid B-tree node size'  Following the advice in this link:  I tried to list my drives with the Terminal command  codedf -hl/code  The specificied disk was not in the list When I tried the suggested codetail/code command  codetail -f /var/log/fsck_hfs.log/code  I saw the name of the disk as   precode/dev/rdisk3s2: ** The volume   could not be verified completely. /code/pre  Following that, I used this command (also suggested in the above link)  codesudo fsck_hfs -r -d /dev/disk3s2/code  Instead of the expected proper outcome, what I received was an error message in Terminal as below:  precodeinancs-MacBook-Pro:~ INCA$ sudo fsck_hfs -r -d /dev/disk3s2 Password: journal_replay(/dev/disk3s2) returned 0 ** /dev/rdisk3s2     Using cacheBlockSize=32K cacheTotalBlock=65536 cacheSize=2097152K.    Executing fsck_hfs (version hfs-226.1.1). ** Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.    Invalid B-tree node size (3, 0) ** The volume   could not be verified completely.     volume check failed with error 7      volume type is pure HFS+      primary MDB is at block 0 0x00      alternate MDB is at block 0 0x00      primary VHB is at block 2 0x02      alternate VHB is at block 1464477326 0x574a268e      sector size = 512 0x200      VolumeObject flags = 0x07      total sectors for volume = 1464477328 0x574a2690      total sectors for embedded volume = 0 0x00      CheckHFS returned -1317, fsmodified = 0 /code/pre  What are my options? I have Data Rescue but not Disk Warrior (low on budget these days). Is there a possibility to fix the drive?  If not, and if I can rescue my data and put it on a different disk, is it safe to format the current drive and re-add my photos or should i stay away from this disk?
