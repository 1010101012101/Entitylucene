Safari unresponsive at quit? <body> Every time I hit âŒ˜ + Q in Safari it freezes it completely and goes unresponsive, so far I have done every thing possible to fix this issue. I made a video if you don't understand what I'm talking about. I contacted Apple and they told me to do a Time Machine back up than do a complete OS reinstall. I reinstalled OS X from the recovery menu and than I migrated to my Time Machine back but Safari still doesn't work when I hit quit. I also tried everything here I deleted all the Safari caches, preference files, application saved states. I'm gonna head out to the Apple Store in a bit just wanted to see if I can get some last minute help before I head out.

The message says Im running out of ram but my RAM monitor shows that I have perfectly enough. <comment220714> Oh ya I tried quitting in Safe Mode too but I can't quit there either. Whenever I login with my moms account on the computer its totally fine and everything is normal. <comment220718> Here is the [error message](https://paste.ee/r/GOsyK) from when I Force Quit Safari. <comment220778> This would be my prime suspect.../Applications/Boom 2.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/Boom2Daemon.app/Contents/MacOS/Boom2Daemon <comment220781> Create another user account.
