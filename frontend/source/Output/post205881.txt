Different pricing of apps regarding regions in country <body> My customer asked me the following question:  "Imagine the situation you have an app that costs 0.99$. Is there any way to make this app free in certain area, such as chosen cities in a country? Obviously we would make a deal with city council that they allow this app to be free within the city"  The straightforward answers is "no, this is totally impossible", but after all I decided to ask the community here.   Maybe there is a way to set some promo codes in in app payments? I mean, the app download is free but to use this app after installation you must do some in-app purchase or fill the promo code to use the app for free. And these promo codes would be delivered to citizens in some way.  Do you have any idea how to approach such problem? Or maybe it's even pointless to look for any solution?  Thanks in advance  <answer205898> strongYou can use the promo codes/strong     You can request up to 100 promo codes for every version of your app. To request promo codes for an app version, the versionâ€™s status must be Ready for Sale or Pending Developer Release.   https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/ProvidingPromoCodes.html  strongYou can send gift/strong     Learn how to send iTunes Gifts in the iTunes Store, iBooks Store1, and App Store.
