Reduce email storage space on iCloud <body> Following the instructions here,   https://support.apple.com/kb/PH12795?locale=en_US  I deleted 10 months of old emails and emptied the trash in iCloud.  Before I deleted those emails, I had 2.8GB of space available on iCloud; after deleting them and emptying the trash, I had 1.83GB available.  How can I possible have less space available after deleting 10 months of email at the iCloud site??  Many thanks.  <comment300725> Where are you viewing your iCloud storage?  If this is an iOS device, Settings  General  Storage and iCloud usage  Manage Storage will give details about how your iCloud space is used. <comment300877> Thanks, Tyson.  All is well now.  When I checked back a day later I see that I now have much more free space after deleting those old emails.
