How do I move a window vertically above the menu bar? <body> How can I move a window so that the title bar of the window is above the menu bar?  I've tried using AppleScript…  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     set position of windows to {-100, -100} end tell /code/pre  …and whilst the codex/code variable works, moving the window partially off-screen, the codey/code doesn't, moving the window up to the menu bar and no further.  I've also tried Keyboard Maestro:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BoEO9.png" alt="Move Front Window to Position"  …but have the same problem: the codex/code value works but the codey/code does not.  supThis question is related, but opposite: How do I move a window whose title bar is off-screen?br I want to be able to emcause/em the title bar to be off-screen./sup  <answer123727> Finder does not allow this as a general rule. Sometimes a glitch can make this possible, but relaunching Finder usually rectifies it. There's currently no known way to actually get this to happen as a desired behavior, sorry.  <answer136149> 1) Download and build Megazoomer, or use this binarybr 2) copy codemegazoomer.bundle/code to code/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins//code (you need SIMBL pre-installed)br 3) restart app that you want to maximizebr 4) press kbdCMD/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd or choose Window - Megazoom  Window will be maximized and placed above the menubar so it will take 100% of screen space without actually entering fullscreen mode.  Here is a really big TextEdit.app for your enjoyment (it doesn't support fullscreen out of the box)   http://i.imgur.com/ir4tFQe.png  This plugin will do nothing to Carbon-based applications, since SIMBL will only inject code into Cocoa applications.  <answer136161> the only way to get a window fullscreen (not showing the menubar) is to either go to fullscreen mode or write your own Application using CoreGraphic (like programming a game).  So the Apple window handling (integrated in the OS) doesn't impact cause the Application is drawing it selfs via the graphic driver and not via the OS.  <answer162794> Not really an answer, more a 'don't try this, it doesn't work'  ... one thing strongnot/strong to do is try changing which of 2 screens ought to have the menu bar - unless you want to spend 10 minutes putting all your windows back in the right place  <comment134469> — do you need the titlebar, and is this for all windows, or one in particular? <comment134470> @l'L'l No, I don't need the title bar — I specifically don't want it ;) Just one window, but the ability to change the window if necessary (don't mind changing the code each time). I literally want to replicate the glitch shown in the [screenshot of the linked question](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bZLLe.png), but on purpose, on demand :) <comment134483> Ah yes, I'm familiar with that bug, although it's been a while since I've seen it. I think the key to achieving this might be creating your own glitch in this way. Do you recall when it happens? <comment134485> @l'L'l I've had it once ages ago, when I was switching resolutions, but haven't been able to reproduce it. <comment136219> Does Finder actually allow this really without bugging ? <comment136220> @Matthieu Not quite sure what you mean — it's a bug, but I want to recreate it. <comment154387> And luckily it doesn't! I remember a window opening above my Desktop in OS 7, it was a major pain to get it back in place! <comment161223> George, I have no idea how to contact you directly. Please reopen the question you have previously closed. I just had one more freeze while hotswitching between users. Stuck on a gray screen. I was able to ssh into the machine from the second computer. Killing Windowserver got  my laptop unstuck, but it also killed all GUI apps that resulted in a loss of unsaved changes. I'd love to know better ways of solving such issues. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129754/how-to-get-my-screen-responding-again <comment161227> @Sergei I have voted to re-open the question. For future reference you can contact me in [chat] by pinging me with "@George" <comment161440> SIMBL is really outdated. Using such technology on current operating systems may cause problems. <comment161441> Use [EasySIMBL](https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL) then <comment161702> I don't want an app resizing, just moved up (behind or on top of) the menu bar. <comment161704> I can't get this to work. I have EasySIMBL and it works fine with other SIMBL bundles, but not megazoomer. The menu option doesn't show and the keyboard shortcut doesn't do anything either. Furthermore, I'm not sure this can do what I need anyway? Can a zoomed app then continue to be moved up? <comment161821> No, window can't be moved up any further. Megazoomer works fine for me on 10.9.3 with EasySIMBL. <comment161879> what do you mean with on top of? really above in z-axis or in y-axis? if you mean in y-axis that's not possible if you mean in z then either use the built in fullscreen mode (so the menubar disapears) or as i said you need to rewrite the App so it draws it selfs direct to the screen and doesn't use the os to draw it's content. if the app uses the os to draw it's content the os draw method will also prevent the app from  it's content over the menubar (i really hope it's clear what i tell you this time!) <comment161905> I don't mind if it's in front of the menu bar or behind the menu bar, providing it is moved vertically upwards, beyond the menu bar, [as per the screenshot in the linked question](http://i.stack.imgur.com/bZLLe.png). <comment161907> This won't work and is s bug of Filezilla i think and in my opinion seeing only half of the App doesn't make sens either. I really can't see any possible Situation were i would need an app to act like this. <comment268306> I don't know why this was languishing with zero points: this is actually very good advice. It seems such a simple thing to try … until you have to recover from it. <comment268307> Thanks for the late upvote :) It gave me chance to spot & fix my typo ;-)
