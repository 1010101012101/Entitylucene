How to open a new blank document in Pages from spotlight? <body> How can i open a new blank document in Pages app on Mac OSX Yosemite in Spotlight (and therefore in Alfred)?  Now, when i open Pages it first presents me with New document dialog and then Select Template dialog. Of course i click my way through all the prompts but it would be much more convenient to bring up Spotlight (or better yet Alfred) and just type something like Pages /n and go straight to typing.  <answer202353> Part of the problem can be eliminated by selecting a default template in the strongPreferences/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/owssV.png" alt="Pages preferences"  Then, when opening from strongSpotlight/strong or strongAlfred/strong, a click on the new document button opens your default template.  [Blank in the case of the setting shown above.]  Then, one could create an strongAutomator/strong or strongApplescript/strong workflow that is attached to a service evoked by a keystroke combination.  hr /  Edit: OP @Rusl added this Applescript to a keystroke combination.  precodetell application "Pages"   activate   make new document end tell /code/pre  <comment244068> And Terminal command to do the same would be great, too <comment244378> Thanks for making me think in right direction. Here is the Apple Script that I've bound to a shortcut that will open a blank new Page document. Also, if I run this script from Alfred it will also open a blank new Page document.  `tell application "Pages"     activate     make new document end tell` <comment244396> Great!  I'll add your script to the answer for future reference.
