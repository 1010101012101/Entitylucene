Remove password completely from Macbook Pro Yosemite <body> I am setting up a user and don't want a password. When leaving the new password field blank and hitting OK, the message "your new password is empty" and did not let me proceed.   Can anyone please help on macOS ?  <answer265836> You can use codedscl . -passwd /Users/foo/code.  Don't use codepasswd/code since a 0 char password isn't valid, and won't accept the input of "nothing"  <answer265839> ol liChoose System Preferences from the Apple menu (), then click Users &amp; Groups./li liClick the lock , then enter account password./li liClick Login Options./li liChoose an account from from the “Automatic login” pop-up menu, then enter the password of that account./li /ol  <answer265847> If you are running Sierra (at least that is what I tested) you can remove the password completely: SystemPreferences-Users&amp;Groups-"ChangePasword": enter your Old Password, leave the New Password fields open, it will ask you if you really want to leave these open, do not react and hit Enter.  <comment333351> This doesn't remove a password but enables "Automatic" login".
