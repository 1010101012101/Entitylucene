I have the same settings as you do for Facebook, using Jabber. <comment116302> @Dave pls upvote my query, so that we can have some solution. <comment116541> FWIW, my account periodically has been doing the same thing. I have to go Offline, and come back on in order to resolve back into usernames. I am guessing this must mean there is an issue with Jabber and Facebook interconnectivity, but I cannot verify that.
