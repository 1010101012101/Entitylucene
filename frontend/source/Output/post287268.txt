iMac connected to Wi-Fi but not to the Internet <body> I have a 2009 iMac (24 inch) running El Capitan (10.11.6). For a few days I have not been able to connect to the internet. The Wi-Fi network is connected to the internet because I can access it with my other devices.   I have turned Wi-Fi on and off in System Preferences but that did not help. I can also see a good IP address in System Preferences.  I would appreciate any help.  <answer287271> Try to diagnose your internet connection:  precodeSystem Preferences -&gt; Network -&gt; Assist me… -&gt; Diagnostics… /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5oVxy.png" alt="Network settings"  <comment362658> What is the output of `ifconfig en1`?  Also, please provide the output of `route -n get default`  Please post the results by **editing the original question** <comment362728> That worked! There was a problem with the DNS settings.
