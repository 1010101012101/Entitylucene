Can't drag folder to desktop <body> Since upgrading to Mountain Lion, every time I try to drag a folder to my desktop it only makes an alias. Is there any way to reenable moving regular folders? It's really obnoxious to have to make another directory every time I want to move something for a short while.  <answer91108> ol liTry deleting the Finder preferences (coderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Finder.plist/code)/li liTry to replicate the problem on another user account on the same Mac./li liLook for utilities which change the keyboard behaviour./li /ol  <comment106967> My Mac does not do this, so it is not the standard behaviour. Does pressing alt and cmd while dragging help? <comment106968> Holding command makes it drag the actual folder. I want the default behavior though so I don't need an extra command to do what it should do anyhow. <comment106969> That is a good interim solution though. <comment106988> Did you try log in on as new user ?
