How to reduce bounce time for reminder icon Outlook for Mac 2011? <body> Whenever I have a meeting reminder, it causes the notification icon to pop up in the dock and start bouncing. It seems to bounce for a very long time sometimes before it actually shows me the reminder popup.  h1img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEOSb.png" alt="Office Reminders App in Dock" â†’ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/swSxf.png" alt="Office Reminders Popup"/h1  This is very annoying and not useful. Can I change how long the icon bounces for before showing the alert?  supI am on OS X 10.8.5/sup
