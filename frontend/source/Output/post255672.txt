Back-up restoration via iCloud for WhatsApp's stuck <body> I have just re-downloaded Whatsapp and wanted to restore the chats that I have backed up. However, this occurs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCJzp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  It has been stuck at 99% for the whole evening. I have tried following the guide WhatsApp published online but to no avail.   Is there anything that anyone knows which can help?
