How can I automate GIF to PNG with Preview using AppleScript? <body> I have a GIF file but I can open it only with Preview because it is a little bit ruined (GIMP or other programs does not open it correctly but it works with Preview).  I want to export it to PNG files. As far as I know the only way to do it is:  ol liManually select the next frame/li liFile â†’ Export/li liChoose the right format to export and specify the path/li liClick Save and repeat/li /ol  I'd like to automate it. Some advice?  <answer111586> You would have to use something like php, or a workflow.  There are no AppleScript dictionaries for Preview.  Which means you would not be able to do it in AppleScript.  <answer111587> You could also try using ImageMagick:  precodeconvert -coalesce animation.gif frame%04d.png /code/pre  You can install ImageMagick with codebrew install imagemagick/code or codesudo port install imagemagick/code.  <comment131231> "There are no AppleScript dictionaries for Preview." this is the answer! <comment131232> Preview has actually had a basic AppleScript dictionary by default since 10.9, but there is no "Preview suite" or no commands for manipulating images. <comment131244> Although this doesn't involve Preview as per the OP's question, this will solve your problem. . <comment131255> Probably this automation can be done in GraphicConverter as well.  But still, that is not Preview as required.
