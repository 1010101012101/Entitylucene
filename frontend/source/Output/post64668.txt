How to fetch an AirPort/Wi-Fi password using /usr/bin/security <body> I have been trying to use /usr/bin/security rather than hard coding login/password information into scripts. For example, here's how you get the password for 'pinboard.in'  precodesecurity 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null find-internet-password -gs pinboard.in |\ grep '^password: ' |\ sed 's#^password: "##g ; s#"$##' /code/pre  em(Note: Someone who is better at grep/awk can probably combine those last two lines, just be sure to consider for when a password may have a " in it — or a space.)/em  What I emcan't/em do is figure out how to retrieve the password for a Wi-Fi network if all I know is the SSID.  I have even tried specifying the kind of data I am looking for with code-D/code:  codesecurity 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null find-generic-password -D "AirPort network password" -s MySSIDhere/code  but all I get is this  codesecurity: SecKeychainSearchCopyNext: The specified item could not be found in the keychain./code  All I have found via Google has been about emadding/em SSID password information on the CLI, but I want to emretrieve/em it.  <answer64678> I got my password with  precodesecurity find-generic-password -D "AirPort network password" -a YourSSIDhere -g /code/pre  Main difference is code-a SSID/code. I found that in which field it was stored by letting security take a dump:  precodesecurity dump-keychain /code/pre  <comment75971> Are Wi-Fi passwords stored in the keychain? I don’t think so. <comment75980> Yes, they are... <comment75982> You are not on Mountain Lion I assume, the `sed` doesn't work there anymore (at least not for Skype, different output format). To get rid of the grep use `... | sed '/^password: /s#^...` <comment76167> That's not working for me. <comment76187> @TJLuoma If you could add a little bit more details (what was the output of the command, did you run `security dump-keychain` first, etc.), someone may be able to help you.
