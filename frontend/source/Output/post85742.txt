>console does not work <body> I have enabled the login window so that the username and password must be entered to login to an account. However, when I switch out of my user and type console into the username field, the screen flashes white and nothing happens.  Why is this happening? Can I fix it?  <answer85743> I, too, had this problem. The way I fixed it was to log out of all accounts on my Mac. After this, console login worked flawlessly.    <comment98815> This helped me, thanks!
