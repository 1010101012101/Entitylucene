Two year old Macbook Pro doesn't recognize internal HD after format and NVRAM reset <body> Messed up an Install of Sierra so reformatted the internal SSD (through Command-R boot), and cleared NVRAM.  After this, the computer no longer recognizes the drive.  Could the drive have gone bad at just the wrong moment, or does something need reset?  Model A1494  Update: after resetting the SMC, the laptop sees the drive (looking in Disk Utility after a Command-R boot), but shows it as read only and with SMART status not supported.  <comment320436> UPDATE: Installed Ubuntu from a USB drive and it worked.  Seems the drive works, but MacOS installers won't use it.
