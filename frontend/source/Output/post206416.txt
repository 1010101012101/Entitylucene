AppleScript to export script editor script as application <body> I have a binary that I want wrapped up as an Application, so I thought this was a good use case for AppleScript.   I want to automate how Script Editor lets you export an AppleScript as a .app bundle. This is what I have so far, I'm confused about how to read the libraries dictionary for the script editor.   precodetell application "Script Editor"  set command to "do shell script " &amp; "\"APP_PATH\"" set innard to {contents: command} set Tallgeese to make new document with properties innard save Tallgeese as "application"  end tell /code/pre  <answer206443> You must specify the full path where you want to save this application.  Here is an example that saves it in the "strongApplications/strong" folder of the user.  precodeset appName to "someAppName" set thePath to (path to applications folder from user domain as string with folder creation) &amp; appName &amp; ".app" tell application "Script Editor"     set command to "do shell script " &amp; "\"/bin/ls\""     set innard to {contents:command}     set Tallgeese to make new document with properties innard     compile Tallgeese     save Tallgeese as "application" in thePath     close document 1 -- close the document     -- quit ---- quit the editor end tell /code/pre  <comment248860> I get " Script Editor got an error: Canâ€™t get document "someAppName". (-1728)" with this (just changed app_path to /bin/ls) <comment248864> Try the edited script <comment248865> Yes! Dude you are awesome! Also is there an easy way in Apple Script to add an image for the icon or I can just add that in the app folder with icns. <comment248882> Also, when this app crashes as it will since I'm developing it, where does the debug log or exception information go? Currently I'm not seeing anything on stdout or console's logs
