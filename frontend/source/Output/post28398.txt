Jailbreaking an iPad 2 with iOS 5 <body> Is it possible to jailbreak an iPad 2 running iOS 5? Please let me know if it's possible. If so, how do I do it?  <answer28401> Currently, the answer is no. It is fairly widely known that the A5 is a fairly difficult nut to crack.  References:  ul liThe Dev Team Pwnage tool info/li /ul     The 4.3.1 untether works on all devices that actually support 4.3.1   except for the iPad2:      ul   liiPhone3GS/li   liiPhone4 (GSM)/li   liiPod touch 3G/li   liiPod touch 4G/li   liiPad1/li   liAppleTV 2G (PwnageTool only for now)/li   /ul   ul liCult of Mac Post On iOS 5 Jailbreaks/li /ul     As for the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, both devices run Apple’s new A5   processor, which is proving to be an absolute bitch to jailbreak. Only   the iPad 2 can be jailbroken under iOS 4.3.3 using the userland   JailBreakMe v3 exploit. If the iPad 2 is any example to go by, don’t   expect the iPhone 4S to be jailbroken any time soon.
