Can't connect more than 2 DS3 controllers over Bluetooth <body> I've been trying to get 4 DS3 controllers to connect via Bluetooth to my MacBook Air 2014, but only 2 of them actually connect. The other two are recognized but neither are able to connect.  Before, I believe I've been able to connect 3 of them, but now it no longer works. I am currently on Sierra 10.12, which might be the problem but I'm not sure.  I charged all the batteries before use, so that's not the problem. As for my method of pairing, I press the reset button on the back of the remote, then plug it in to the laptop with USB and wait until the lights flash slowly and the computer sees the controller. Then I disconnect the cable and press the PS button to pair. Rinse and repeat. As I mentioned above, however, pairing stops working past 2 controllers. Any ideas?
