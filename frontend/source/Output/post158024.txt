Why won't my MBP connect to Personal Hotspot via wifi? <body> I have not been able to connect my retina Macbook Pro to my iPhone 5s Personal Hotspot since upgrading to OSX 10.10 (Yosemite).  While I can see the phone in the list of wifi APs under  the "Personal Hotspot" sub-list, attempting to connect to it fails every time, even though the devices are only about two feet from each other.  • I attempted to "forget" the AP and re-add it, but this did not resolve the issue.  • My provider is Verizon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vW8GD.jpg" alt="Failed to enable Personal Hotspot dialogue"  <answer159336> Connected my laptop to a different Hotspot device, then back to my phone. Everything seems to work now. Very strange.  <comment360350> How many Wi-Fi networks do you see on your MacBook Pro under the Wi-Fi top menu? <comment360351> This isn't an answer. Please make a comment to the original wuestion if you see information which might help to avoid you to get the same problem again.
