Clicking "Downloads" in Finder does nothing. How can I repair it? <body> When I click the Downloads item in the Finder, it does nothing.   The previously highlighted item remains highlighted.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dwzsJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I fix this?   If I open a console/bash prompt I can see that code~/Downloads/code exists.  The mode is 755 and I am the owner.  <answer62020> I don't know what the problem was.

Does opening your home folder and then double-clicking the Downloads folder *in the Finder window* work (should open the folder and select Downloads in the sidebar)? <comment71667> Oddly good advice. Sometimes things get wedged in a temporary state, and a reboot or just a pause clears things up. This is why troubleshooting almost always recommends you reboot and make sure the issue is reproducible. Only time will tell if this comes back, but just knowing that it can come and go will help if it does reappear.
