Can I open the menu with keyboard? <body> With PC, alt-something opens the something in the main menu. Does Mac have similar function? For example, is there a way to open View menu as if I click it?  <answer1323> Try kbdCtrl/kbdkbdF2/kbd - that should highlight the Apple-symbol on the main menubar.  edit: The cursor keys and Enter then allow you to navigate, drill-down and ultimately select an item - just as you can on Windows.  also - can't claim credit for this, I learnt it here on the site! What are your favorite Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts?  <comment1113> You can then use arrows and letters to navigate to the other menus and their items. <comment1116> @mankoff - sorry, yeah - good point! I'll edit my answer accordingly. Cheers!
