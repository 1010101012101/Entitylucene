TimeMachine performance issues on OSX Server 10.7.4 <body> we are running OSX Server 10.7.4 on a MAC Pro (Mid 2010). Enabled services are Mail, Calendarserver, Contacts and Websharing.  The Server has a Xeon Quad CPU and 32GB of RAM.  A timecapsule is connected directly via LAN on the second ethernet port.   We are facing really bad performance issues with timemachine.   A timemachine backup takes more than one hour at the 'preparing backup' step. Backing up the data is even slower.   The initial backup (approx 240GB) tool nearly 2 days. Also we encounteres issues with OpenDirectory when the initial backup was running so that people where unable to login to the mail services (imap and smtp).   Another issue we are facing is, that the hourly timemachine backup is really big (10 - 15GB), does anyone have an idea why the backup size is grows that much within an hour?   Is there a way to speed this up?   Thanks in advance.   Any hint on this would be much appreciated.   <comment132097> You may get more specific responses if you can split your single question into multiple questions; one about preparing back up times, and another asking how to determine what is being backed up per Time Machine session.
