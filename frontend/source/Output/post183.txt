What are your favorite Mac OS X keyboard shortcuts? <body> What are your favorite keyboard shortcuts on Mac OS X?  <answer185> kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF2/kbd: Access the menu via the keyboard (Windows kbdalt/kbd+kbdspace/kbd equivalent).  <answer189> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdE/kbd: Put selected text into search clipboard.  Then kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbdG/kbd to find next. In combination with regular copy-paste you can do selective search and replace very quickly and conveniently.  <answer190> kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd8/kbd: High contrast theme.  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd`/kbd (backtick): Cycle through app's windows.  <answer196> Here's a great one (for switchers) I got from the TextMate blog;  Create the folder ~/Library/KeyBindings (if it doesn't already exist) In there, create a key-binding file DefaultKeyBinding.dict In that file, put this text (including all braces &amp; punctuation);  pre {     /* home */     "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";      /* end */     "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";     "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";      /* page up/down */     "\UF72C"  = "pageUp:";     "\UF72D"  = "pageDown:"; } /pre  Save the file, and when you next start a Cocoa app (eg Mail, TextEdit etc) you will find that kbdHome/kbd, kbdEnd/kbd, kbdPg Up/kbd and kbdPg Down/kbd now work as they do on Windows.  It's well worth having a look at the whole of that article - he explains exactly how to make this file and how the bindings work, with information about the other keycodes etc.  <answer200> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd: selective screenshot saved on desktop  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbd4/kbd: selective screenshot  saved in clipboard  <answer202> ul likbdctrl/kbd+kbdA/kbd: Go to the beginning of the line (works in every Cocoa textfield)/li likbdctrl/kbd+kbdE/kbd: Go to the end of the line (works in every Cocoa textfield)/li likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdH/kbd : Pop up the Home folder/li likbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdD/kbd : Pop up the Desktop folder/li /ul  <answer220> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdspace/kbd: activate spotlight.

Specifically (based on frequency of use) kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdH/kbd: Hide application  <answer5786> Zoom shortcuts, very good for presentations:  kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd8/kbd: turn on/off zoom  kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd=/kbd: zoom in  kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd-/kbd: zoom out  <answer7485> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdH/kbd: hide all inactive application windows  This is great for focusing on a single task or works well as a kind of show desktop if you switch to Finder first (providing you have few or no windows open)  <answer7487> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdW/kbd: Close window (or tab).br kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdW/kbd: Close all windows.  <answer7519> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd./kbd: show/hide hidden files on any file dialog  <answer7521> Typing kbd//kbd on any file dialog will give you a "go to folder" dialog, which autocompletes with kbdtab/kbd (you have to wait a second for it to work). This lets you type in the full path, from the root code//code folder.  Extra handy if you want to open from / save to hidden locations or already have the command line path you want to save something in.  This can be also accessed via kbd~/kbd (i.e. the tilde key, to start from your home directory, e.g. code~/Documents/code) or using kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdG/kbd (which starts with the most recently entered directory).  <answer7522> While being in the application switcher (using kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd) cycle to an application by pressing kbd&#x21E5;/kbd or kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd; then - while still holding down kbd&#x2318;/kbd - press the down arrow to see an expose view of the selected app´s windows, including minimized windows. Using the arrow keys navigate to a window you want to bring to the foreground and hit kbd&#x2190;/kbd to select it.  <answer7523> On newer keyboards, invoke Exposé to  ul likbdfn/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show all windows (in the current Space)/li likbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the desktop/li likbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the "current application" windows/li likbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the Exposé preference pane/li /ul  While being in Exposé,   ul licycle through windows with the arrow keys, using return to bring them into focus./li liuse kbd&#x21E5;/kbd and  kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+ kbd&#x21E5;/kbd to cycle through windows by applications (as highlighted in the Dock)/li /ul  <answer7535> Holding down the kbd&#x2325;/kbd while booting to select the startup volume. Holding down kbdC/kbd while booting to boot from a CD/DVD in the drive.  <answer7887> kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd?/kbd: Help-Search, then type any menu item text, can be just a prefix  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdE/kbd: put selected text in search dialog  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdG/kbd and kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdG/kbd: find next/previous  kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd⌃/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd4/kbd: Take a screenshot, press space for whole window screenshot  kbdctrl/kbd + mouse scroller: zoom screen  kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x23CF;/kbd: sleep  <answer8642> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd+kbdspace/kbd+click on a window copies the current window to the desktop.  This is very useful while taking screenshots without the need to crop. The rounded edges stay rounded. Use this with kbdctrl/kbd to copy the image to the clipboard.  <answer11120> For me the life saving shortcut is the quarter increment/decrement of light/sound:  kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd and the increment/decrement light or sound button.  It is extremely useful with LED Cinema Display monitors.  <answer18265> kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2190;/kbd or kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2192;/kbd to move between Mission Control spaces (in Lion).  <answer18270> kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E5;/kbd:  Cycle through applications.  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd`/kbd:  Cycle through the current application's windows.  kbd&#x21E5;/kbd: Auto fill commands and file/directory names in Terminal.  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd: Take a screenshot of a selected area.  kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd3/kbd: Take a screenshot of the whole screen.  <answer36541> kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd Cycles through tabs in a web browser going to the right.    kbdctrl/kbd+kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⇥/kbd Cycles through tabs in a web browser going to the left.   kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&darr;/kbd Goes to the very bottom of a web page or textarea.  kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&uarr; /kbd Goes to the very top of a web page or textarea.    <answer36543> kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd:  Copy selection    kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd: Paste selection    kbd⌘/kbd+kbdX/kbd: Cut selection   <answer38474> kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdEsc ⎋/kbd brings up the force quit dialog, which is handy for killing unresponsive applications. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O6rwj.png" alt="Force quit applications"  kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdShift ⇧/kbd + kbdEsc ⎋/kbd held down for 5 seconds kills the foremost application.  <answer50328> In a text area:br kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd→/kbd the end of the line (like End)br kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + kbd←/kbd the beginning of the line (like Home)br kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbd→/kbd jump forward one wordbr kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbd←/kbd jump back one word    <answer83163> kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdL/kbd   turn the lights off  <answer96421> kbdshift/kbd+kbdF12/kbd or kbdF11/kbd - change sound volume without 'bip' sound  <answer124338> kbdfn/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show all windows (in the current Space)  kbdfn/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the desktop  kbdfn/kbd+kbdctrl/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the "current application" windows  kbdfn/kbd+kbd⌥/kbd+kbdF3/kbd: show the Exposé preference pane  <answer144303> kbd⌘/kbd+kbdalt/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+V   pastes plain text, SUPER useful for copying from web pages or MS Word into email, and leaving the weird formatting behind.  <answer228983> In Finder, kbd⌥/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdP/kbd brings up the full path. If you then hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd in Finder, you can paste the full path of a file or folder into your Terminal or elsewhere by kbd⌘/kbd+kbdV/kbd.  <answer228988> Not wholly keyboard shortcut, but holding down the Option key (kbd&#x2325;/kbd) and bringing up a system menu often provides extensive information. For instance if you are connected to wifi, hold down kbd&#x2325;/kbd and clicking on the network menu will bring up a lot of information (MAC address, IP address, signal strength, emet c/em.) about the current network connection.  Holding kbd&#x2325;/kbd and clicking on the notification icon also sets your notification status to "Do not disturb"---rather useful when discussing something on your screen with colleagues and you don't want to see Messages popping up.  <answer229021> ⌘+z [undo] is my favorite &amp; the one I tell the people I support to remember if they only learn one shortcut.  In Finder it undoes the last operation you just performed from inadvertently beginning to rename a file or folder; or undoing an unintentional drag and drop of a file or folder into the wrong folder or undoing a move to trash operation. In applications many have multiple levels of undo which lets you step backward undoing previous edits or draws. Extremely useful in extricating yourself from sticky situations or just after having made a simple mistake.  <comment131> +1 - This tip alone has just totally justified getting involved in the beta. I don't know how I haven't found this previously, but I have often wanted to access the menu without a mouse. <comment159> The first two are the standard emacs keybindings, and you can use many of the standard emacs keybindings on (all?) Cocoa applications.  `ctrl+t` is a favourite one: for transposing two characters. <comment160> I love ctrl-alt-cmd-8; we used to do that at all the computers to joke people, but if you're working at night it works well too. <comment162> True. Nice one for `ctrl-t` ! <comment165> PS: There's a list of all Mac OS Keyboard Shortcuts available at http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343 <comment202> The kids in our school call it the x-ray mode. <comment502> I tried approaches like this for a while, but then got annoyed by the apps that didn't use the keybindings.  It's probably better to get used to it.  (You won't have it remapped on a school's, library's, or friend's Mac for example.)  I switch between OS X, Windows, and Linux all the time and while it took a little getting used to each of them, spending the time has been worth it. <comment541> +1 for the cmd+backtick shortcut, I've wondered about such a command for a long time! <comment817> It only selects apple menu, but nothing shows up :( <comment902> And then you can move around the menus with the arrow keys, press Enter to expand a menu, and again Enter to run a command. <comment2094> Putting only one shortcut (or a couple of related ones) in each answer will make the poll more useful. <comment2096> Thanks for Shift-Ctrl-Eject, I was looking for something like that. <comment3913> +1 for Cmd+,  Now if I can only remember to use it... <comment3914> @Benjamin:  I disagree.  I've been using a Mac for 3+ years now and still haven't adjusted.  I agree with the concept of adjusting (for instance, Cmd+c instead of Ctrl+c), but I think the home and end thing is just too much for me for whatever reason.  Also, I'm not too concerned with how I will work on friend's or library's computers, since I spend 99% of my time on my own computer.  +1 for an answer that changed the way I use my Mac! <comment5058> Ctrl+F3 focuses the dock (and shows it if it's autohidden) <comment6022> Cmd + shift + ´ on swedish layout <comment8059> @Benjamin: I also disagree. Having used Mac for 7+ years, I still prefer the Windows way for doing pageup/down and moving to end of line. Maybe because I use a "Win" keyboard (Razer BlackWidow) or maybe because I learned to use computer with DOS and later Windows 3.11. But in any case, my hands are used to the WinWay. :) <comment8094> THIS IS AWESOME. And SO MUCH better than Ctrl+Shift+G or whatever it is... (hence why it's so much better). I wish I could up-vote you 230986 times! <comment8549> You can use `kbd` to format keys. I've also added some HTML comments, because there's an unknown character in the last three (at least under Win7). <comment8551> Thanks for the kbd tip :) I removed html comments, while it looks fine on my mac. <comment8556> Depending on you keyboard and key bindings, you might need to press `Ctrl` + `function (fn)` + `F2` <comment8570> Good one! I wish this shortcut also worked in finder windows. <comment9232> As an add on: `Cmd+Shift+4` and then a `space` converts the mouse pointer into a "Camera". Clicking on a window with this "Camera" pointer creates a screenshot of only that window. <comment9245> Noting, of course, that all of these are fully customizable. <comment9654> +1 for Ctrl+Shift+Eject... useful if I leave my computer and want to make the screens turn off quickly. <comment11620> +1 for the photoshop comment :) <comment11918> This is also works with "~" <comment12637> shift command comma is awesome, thanks for that. <comment26841> you should separate the separate keys into different keys :P <comment26864> Ctrl-f3 gives you access to the dock <comment28622> This doesn't seem to work (anymore?) on my late 2011 MacBook Air running 10.7.1. <comment28633> I have not tried in 10.7 yet, but I would be surprised if it is not working. <comment33321> Wow! I've looked for this! <comment39417> Not working here on OS X Lion either. <comment40918> I really want to change this to `alt` <comment41562> +1 Love the sleep all displays!!!!!! <comment43565> Ahhh, thanks. I've been looking for ways to quickly turn off my computer. <comment51922> In Chrome, you can use `⌘` + `⌥` + `←` and `⌘` + `⌥` + `→` to cycle between tabs. <comment57690> I've never been more excited about a forward slash. I'll try and fail to  express my excitement about this shortcut to my wife when I get home. <comment57692> I guess there isn't an alternative for the Sleep all displays for the new MBA's which don't have an eject button anymore? I've setup a Hot Corner which does this, but would prefer a keyboard shortcut. <comment57693> Cmd+Left = Home and Cmd+Right = End. Cmd+Up and Cmd+Down go to the top and bottom of the page, so not a replacement of page up and page down. <comment57767> +1 Excellent find with the '5 second hold to kill'! <comment57783> I use it all the time! <comment58727> It's working again in 10.7.4. <comment80540> Changing the `4` to a `3` makes an image of the whole screen immediately (no mouse selection) if you're into that kinda thing. <comment80541> for anyone confused by this, 'startup volume' refers to the disk/partition to boot the OS from, not the sound level of the startup 'chime'! <comment80574> Was gone in Lion, seems to be back in Mountain Lion. <comment80578> @IainDawson: It came back before, 10.7 is Lion and it's back since version 10.7.4. <comment110367> @DonnaLea, there is alternative. Press power button instead of eject. So it's Ctrl+Shift+Power. <comment111411> I've found that Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E are generally a lot nicer to use than Cmd+Left and Cmd+Right, especially if you change your CapsLock key to Ctrl, and they work in Terminal too. <comment111412> In newer versions of Mac OS, you can also do Cmd+Shift+? to bring up the Help menu directly, and then use its built-in expose to search for a command then select it with the arrow keys. <comment116830> @Senseful You can set the `AppleShowAllFiles` key in `com.apple.Finder` to `true` to enable this in the finder. Then restart the finder. <comment145445> That doesn't turn off any lights. could you elaborate on what exact lights go off and verify it's ⌃⇧L <comment290079> I couldnt get it to work, am I doing something wrong? I go to the relevant finder window and hit this shortcut <comment300326> Awesome!  How can I have not known about this my whole life?
