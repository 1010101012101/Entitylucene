iPhone 4s switches back on immediately after switching off? <body> I dropped my iPhone 4S in a puddle.  After a few days in rice everything was fine, except the battery life sucks and as soon as I power the phone off (completely) the apple logo appears and it turns on once again.   This means that I cannot replace the battery as the phone must be off to replace it.  Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?  <answer290683> This happened to me once, after I got the charging port wet on my iPhone 4s.  I was able to power down my iPhone by having it connected to a power source while going through the shutdown sequence. It would then remain off even if I unplugged the cable.  Of course you could simply let it drain all the way down, especially if battery life is as awful as you say.  <comment367609> If memory serves, iPhone 4S opens from the back, so theoretically you *could* just take off the back cover and unplug  the battery even with the phone on. Im pretty sure I've done this a few times in the past.
