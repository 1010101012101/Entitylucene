Fitbit app doesn't show sleep stages <body> I have a faulty copy of an app stored to the cloud. When I delete it from the phone and try to reinstall it I get a copy of the faulty app from the cloud. How do I delete the copy of the app that is stored on the cloud so that I can install it fresh?  <comment359574> This is an IOS app from Fitbit <comment359594> Have you tried contacting Fitbit support about how to do this on their app? <comment359608> Yes, and they shipped me a replacement device, with no fix. I've tried all the recommendations from the website as well as dealing with support on several occasions. Also, with no fix. <comment359609> I'm of the opinion that the problem is with the app that is installed on my iphone, that is also stored on the icloud. I would like to remove the current version of the app on icloud and reinstall it fresh.
