Chrome suddenly started crashing for half of the pdfs <body> I am not using the Acrobat add-on. It only crashes for certain PDFs, and if I refresh sometimes the PDF will load properly. It crashes even if Chrome is the only application I have running, and the PDF is the only tab.  Here's a few links where my Chrome can't load the PDFs.  http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/courses/348_Spring2014/lectures/introtoml.pdf http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/courses/348_Spring2014/lectures/naivebayes_ai.pdf
