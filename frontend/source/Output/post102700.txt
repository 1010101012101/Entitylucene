How to know which files iTunes could not import? <body> I'm trying to import a large iTunes library from an XML file, but at the end I get a message:     Some songs of "example.xml" file were not imported because they were not found   However, I know that all the songs in the XML really exist (since I've generated it a few minutes before), so how can I know which songs iTunes didn't import? Is there maybe a log somewhere I could look at?  <comment120868> I do not know about the log, but using simple sort by (date, name ect.) on both sides, you can see which one is downloaded and which one is not. <comment120897> Can you diff songs in "recently added" section vs. the song list you are importing and see what is missing?  You should be able to export them in a variety of formats from iTunes.
