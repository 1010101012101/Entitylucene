Newstand for Swift <body> This is a simple one; I've been looking around for a new NewstandKit supported by swift.  Does this exist? Or must I use Obj-C in creating a newstand app?  Thanks, bmckie  <answer159462> All Cocoa libraries available in Objective-C should be available in Swift. NewsstandKit is available in Swift, and can be imported into a project using codeimport NewsstandKit/code. If you'd like more information on the subject, check out Apple's NewsstandKit Framework Reference.
