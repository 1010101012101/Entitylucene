Why can't python find scipy after a pip install? <body> I'm using pip to install python packages on macOS Sierra. When I pip install scipy and try to import it, python can't find the module. However when I pip install numpy and do the same thing, it seems to work. What's going wrong?  <comment338599> Can you post the exact `pip install` commands you used, and the exact Python code you're using to try to import them? Also can you post your PATH environment variable? <comment338644> Hi @Steve  It's nothing at all fancy to install I typed in the command prompt `pip install scipy` Then I opened up python2.7 and imported scipy to see if it worked like so `python` `import scipy` and an import error arose $PATH = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin
