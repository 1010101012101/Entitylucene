Logging MacBook firewall is empty <body> I have enabled the built-in firewall on my MacBook (Sierra v10.12.1), but unfortunately the log files located in /var/log (appfirewall.log and alf.log) stay empty. I contacted Apple Support but they don't know the reason or a solution to this problem. I saw someone with a similar problem and concerns at: Firewall logging enabled, but not recording which isn't resolved.   Any ideas how to handle this one?  <comment371808> Please add your system version by editing your question and adding the proper tag.
