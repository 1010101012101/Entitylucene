Firefox Command+K no longer opens search <body> In Firefox, pressing kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdK/kbd used to open a search page. But as of recent updates, it only focuses the URL bar.  I have the search bar hidden... so this sort of makes sense. However when I want to search for something with periods in it, Firefox treats it as a URL. For example: codedocument.getElementById()/code.  Is there a way to restore the old kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdK/kbd functionality of opening a true search field?  <answer278876> This seems to work, in that it allows you to search in the URL bar for things that Firefox interprets as URLs.  ol liHit Command+K/li liEnter codedocument.getElementById()/code/li liHit the TAB key (or the down key) once to change selection from codehttp://document.getElementById() - Visit/code to codedocument.getElementById() - Search with Google/code/li liHit ENTER/li /ol  <answer278889> The reason you can't make the kbdcommand/kbdkbdK/kbd keyboard shortcut take you to the dedicated search field is because it's not there. So, it now comes to a decision between learning how to use the URL field to conduct the search you want, or getting the dedicated search bar back?   Here are your two options:  ol liLeave it as is and when you conduct a search for something that has periods in it, just use quotation marks. So, instead os searching for codedocument.getElementById()/code, you search for code"document.getElementById()"/code instead./li liRestore the default toolbar by going to strongView  Toolbars  Customize.../strong and in the window that appears, select the Restore Defaults option at bottom-right. This will make the dedicated search field present and allow the kbdcommand/kbdkbdK/kbd keyboard shortcut to work as you want./li /ol  <answer278900> When searching from the URL bar, I prepend a space before search terms containing a code./code. This forces Firefox not to treat the first two words as a domain name. This has worked since even before Firefox 1.0.  In your case though, make sure you have the strongSearch Bar/strong in Firefox’s drawer/“hamburger” menu. Pressing kbd⌘ cmd/kbd kbdK/kbd focuses that search bar for me, without needing to drag it onto the application’s main toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SmfRt.png" alt="Search Menu"  If the strongSearch Bar/strong is missing, open that same menu, and click strongCustomize/strong. Drag the strongSearch Bar/strong from the collection of strongAdditional Tools and Features/strong onto your “hamburger” menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/klHah.png" alt="Customize Menu"  If the strongSearch Bar/strong isn’t available from there, you may need to strongRestore Defaults/strong.  <comment350994> That's fine for CMD+L but I want the dedicated search field back for CMD+K. <comment350995> I'm confused. You want the dedicated search field back, but only when you hit CMD+K? <comment351001> Yes. Command+K used to show the firefox start page. It showed the search field in the middle with the cursor already focused. <comment351003> Thank you for the contribution. However this is not what I was looking for. In a recent previous version of FF the search field did not have to be visible for Command+K to run a dedicated search. <comment351007> In that case, can you clarify how it _did_ work? For example, you have FF open at some website and decide to press Command+K, what happens? Did a dedicated search field appear in the toolbar? Did a popup window appear? Something else? It's not clear to me _how_ it worked if the dedicated search wasn't in your toolbar to begin with. <comment351010> Aah, I'v just seen your comment to Alistair's answer. So Command+K used to just open the FF start page. Hmm... <comment351017> That does work, and it's the closest I can get to the original functionality. However for me that menu is opening on top of the browser window, making it not useful, it's off screen. <comment351018> Thank you everyone for trying to help. It looks like a bug with firefox. I went to file the bug at bugzilla, and saw this is a regression from 3 years ago. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=950014 <comment351019> I moved the menu button around, restarted firefix, and now it seems to work OK. Thank you @Phong! <comment351089> @patrix, I found Phong's answer to be the best and most appropriate. It restored CMD+K to a dedicated search. The only con is it requires at least the firefox menu item to be visible.
