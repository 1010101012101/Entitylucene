Where can I find a map of my MBP french keyboard layout? <body> I just moved to Mac and I need to get used to the keyboard of my Macbook Pro. I've seen images / maps of the QWERTY keyboards but could not find a proper one for French. I want to see what the modifier and options keys does etc. For example finding pipe (|)  was by luck but where the heck are the square brackets?!  Here is my layout:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4OaAz.jpg" alt="French MBP"  <answer15325> To activate the Keyboard Viewer, click on the Input Menu on the right side of your menu bar, and then click on "Show Keyboard Viewer".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xnZ79.png" alt="enter image description here"  Simple as that! :)  <comment16622> If you do not yet have an Input Menu in your menu bar, go to System Preferences  Language and Text  Input Sources to add it.  Probably French OS X has different names for these... <comment16651> Alt+Shift+( et Alt+Shift+). Vindiou not that easy to find :) Good luck if you're stuck coding Objective-C with a french keyboard... I mapped them to F5/F6...
