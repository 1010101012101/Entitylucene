All Photos show more total photos than my Photo app folders. How do I find the “unfiled‘ photos to file them <body> I have a Mac running OS X El Capitan and downloaded from different computers, external drives, tablets etc ALL my photos, 15000 of them. 12000 went into folders and groups that I could easily identify and file.  3,000 are missing in action. It is very hard to pick them out one by one in Moments ( which contains them all). How can I find the un-filed ones to put them in folders please?. Un- filed they are just about lost to me. I have tried everything but admittedly am not very clever about it. Thanks
