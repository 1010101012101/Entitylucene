Macbook Pro Battery Care <body> I found instructions about MacBook battery care, but it made me confused. I received my MacBook Pro yesterday. After unboxing, I used it for some time and then I fully charged the battery. I will be using this laptop as my primary device.  So, my question is, if I use my MacBook about 7-8 hours a day with the charger plugged in, will it be harmful for the battery? What is the recommended way?  <answer106206> To get the most out of your MacBook Pro's battery, follow the Notebook Battery advice from Apple: unplug and use your battery until empty about once a month, then charge back up to full.  If you need help following Apple's advice, use Battery Guardian; it is free and will remind you when to deplete your battery.  <comment124798> @YasirAdnan This article maybe helpful http://gigaom.com/2013/06/22/extend-the-battery-life-of-your-macbook-no-matter-how-old-it-is/
