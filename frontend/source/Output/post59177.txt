How can I permanently disable the Mac keyboard backlight? <body> I'm running Lion, soon to upgrade to Mountain Lion once I can ensure compatibility with installed apps, on an MBPR, and in the meantime I'm being driven crazy by the keyboard backlight. Here's the deal: you may have heard about people who have issues with an undersensitive ambient light sensor, viz.: people turn on "automatically illuminate keyboard in low light" in System Prefs - Keyboard, and then find that the light comes on too frequently.  They are helpfully informed to disable the automatic illumination, and manually to turn the light off using the kbdF5/kbd and kbdF6/kbd keys (actually, technically, the keyboard light down and keyboard light up keys when not using kbdfn/kbd modifier).  Here's the funny thing: I have the "automatically illuminate" setting turned OFF, and I use the keyboard light keys to turn the keyboard light off.  Yet within a second, the light is back on.  Seriously!  Procedures to reproduce:  ol liBe doing anything/li liKeyboard light is on/li liPress keyboard light dim button -- but whatever is reporting the keyboard illumination level thinks the keyboard light is already off: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RLUPU.png" alt="Screenshot displaying keyboard illumination level of 0"/li liPress keyboard light emincrease/em button -- the light actually ends up dimmer, because it increases its illumination to one unit from what it thinks is 0 but is actually something higher./li liPress keyboard light dim button again -- keyboard light switches off for a split second./li li???/li liNo profit. The keyboard demons switched the light back on during step 6, and now the light is on again./li /ol  Once again: I have automatic illumination emDISABLED/em [please don't make me upload another screenshot to prove it:) ].  Frankly, I don't need keyboard illumination. It's occasionally useful in pitch black, but I touch type anyway, so it is usually just an annoying distraction and waste of battery.  So, I'd like to just turn the darn thing off permanently. Terminal commands appreciated!  strongAddendum:/strong Apparently, the behavior does not repeat when plugged into power.  strongAddendum 2:/strong Apparently, the behavior does persist when plugged into power; it just takes longer for the computer to realize that it has stopped annoying me.  <answer59179> I know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but have you tried resetting the pram and smc? That might solve your problem without permanently killing the backlight  <comment68236> Actually, yes, but thanks. I assume (though I don't know a thing about this) that it doesn't make a difference to do so twice.... <comment68237> Depends... On older machines you seemed to have to reset pram several times to really clear it, I know that doesn't sound like it makes alot of sense, but most people observed the same. <comment68239> Interesting. Maybe I will give that a shot sometime in the next few days.
