How to disable "changing a repeating event" dialog in Mac calendar? <body> I have a number of repeating events in Calendar (formerly iCal).  I often make changes to individual ones on-the-go, but every time it asks me this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfl0z.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow can I make the default behaviour change a single event without that dialog appearing?/strong  I suspect there could be a Terminal command I can run.  BONUS: Then, if I want to edit the series, can I still use the codeGet Info/code interface?  <answer295180> Unfortunately it cannot be settled up using CLI settings     defaults  read com.apple.iCal   have no option to change default behaviour. But you can find useful a scripting with AppleScript   <comment257567> Interesting idea. You want to basically never be asked to change all future events? (or are you proposing a script that could automate severing one instance of a repeating event, saving the details and then making a stand alone instance that's not part of the recurring pattern?) <comment260925> @bmike, I think either would work â€” the message is an annoyance 95% of the time for me
