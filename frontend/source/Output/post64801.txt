Prepaid carriers compatible with iPhone 5 <body> I'm about to get an iPhone 5, but if possible I'd love to ditch a contract and get a prepaid plan (and pay for the entire phone without a subsidy).  Are there any prepaid plans which can/should support iPhone 5 (even if they don't do so emofficially/em)?  I'm in the United States.  <answer64835> T-Mobile has announced they will carry the nano-SIM so I suspect it will work with their prepaid plans. We are likely to see tools and instructions for cutting and sanding down SIM's to nano size and then there will be a lot of options. Give it a couple of months to settle out. Unlocked 5's are not likely to be available for a month or two anyway.  <comment76137> Please tell us which country you are in. <comment76144> I'm in the US.  My description is updated.
