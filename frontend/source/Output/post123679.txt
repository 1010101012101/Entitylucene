How to search for emails sent by a specific person in iOS Mail <body> I used to be able to search for emails sent by "Jack Tan" by using the FROM toolbar in the mailbox   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kumOD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After iOS 7 update, it seems the From, All, Subject, and To toolbar has disappeared. It now looks like this when i attempt to search (red bar to indicate the toolbar is gone)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AaVD4.png" alt="enter image description here"  This has not allowed me to search for a specific sender in my Mail. When I attempt to search in my Mail for (e.g. "Jack Tan"), the results will be emails whose content contains "Jack Tan".  strongI want to be able to search for emails sent by "Jack Tan"/strong   <answer123683> Unfortunately Apple has removed this in iOS7. Please also check out this thread about the issue you described.  If you really emneed/em this function right away you have to check for 3rd party apps.  Edit:Some people claim typing; strongfrom: /strong will result in the search you like, but it does not work for me.  <answer123720> You could add "Jack Tan" to the VIP list (at least temporary): it is not a proper solution, but it could help you to locate the messages.  <comment144456> Typing "from :" does not work for me also <comment146522> Would do as workaround I guess, not ideal.
