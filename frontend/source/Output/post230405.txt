Activity Monitor missing process arguments <body> Is there a way to tell Activity Monitor to show me the process arguments the same way ps does for example?  So instead of this (Activity Monitor):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o3yBt.png" alt="ActivityMontior"  I would like to see this (ps):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tJ4P2.png" alt="ps"  If this is impossible in Activity Monitor, is there any other application that can do it? I have tried the latest htop from http://hisham.hm/htop but interestingly it is having the same issue. htop on Linux however was always showing process arguments similar to ps.  <answer284370> To answer my own question: it is not possible to make Activity Monitor show the arguments, however using htop from the "htop" package does exactly what I want:  precode$ brew search htop     htop âœ”     htop-osx  $ htop /code/pre  <comment281221> For the `htop` port, I believe that you need `sudo` to see arguments. As for Activity Manager, I don't believe you can. It's designed to be simple for average users. <comment281226> Even sudo does not help htop, it still displays /usr/bin/java. <comment281357> I would like to correct my comment above, the htop port (brew install htop-osx) does indeed show the arguments using sudo.
