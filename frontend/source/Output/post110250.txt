If I use Apple Tv as a separate display on Mavericks will it transfer sound <body> I want to get an apple tv, so I can wirelessly use my tv as a separate monitor, now with mavericks I know this is supported. I was wondering if this means I can also transfer any sounds from my computer to my tv, otherwise it's sorta not worth getting.  <answer110252> AirPlay mirroring sends video and sound to the connected device.  You can over-ride the sound if needed by selecting an alternate output as well as just send sound to any AirPlay receiver as well.  This is how AirPlay has worked since it started with sound and the video mirroring support keeps adding features as time goes by.  <comment129887> I'm not mirroring though using as a separate space <comment129888> Your sound transfers to the Apple TV upon connecting and then you can over-ride it if needed. The mirror / extend toggle doesn't affect things. I agree that would be less useful if you couldn't get better sound when AirPlay was on. <comment129889> sounds good I'll probably accept this, it would be annoying if they added the support for appletv as a separate display and didn't allow sound to transfer through as well
