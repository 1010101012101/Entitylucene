Keep multiple firmware files in Apple Configurator cache? <body> Is it possible to tell Apple Configurator to not remove existing firmware files in its cache when it downloads a new one?  It seems Apple Configurator only keeps one firmware file (.ipsw) in its codeLibary/Caches/Firmware/code folder. When I work on a device which requires a different firmware file, it downloads it, and then removes the existing file in the codeFirmware/code folder. I was hoping to keep multiple different files there, to be able to quickly switch between different types of devices.  I understand Apple Configurator 2 doesn't allow you to install earlier firmware versions, and I'm not trying to do that. I am working with devices that require different firmware files (e.g. 32 bit vs 64 bit, Touch ID vs no Touch ID), and I don't want to download the files every time I work on a different device.
