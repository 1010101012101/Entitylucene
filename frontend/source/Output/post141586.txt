Mapped keys not working in Finder <body> I am using a keyboard mapping application on Mountain Lion to map combinations like kbdCMD/kbd+v to kbdCTRL/kbd+kbdv/kbd as I'm from a Windows background. However its a bit a hit and miss. For instance Finder still uses kbdCMD/kbd+v as does Ableton.  Does anyone know how to map these keyboard combinations properly?  <comment166853> What keyboard mapping application are you using? Are you aware that you can also set keyboard shortcuts in the System Preferences? Go to `System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - Application Shortcuts` and make a new shortcut for all applications that refers to the menu item `Paste` and is `CTRL+v`. <comment166963> I've done this but in the case of Finder the Menu Item is called "Copy *Filename*" e.g. if the file I was trying to copy was test.txt it would say "Copy test.txt". The menu item name is is changing depending on the filename being copied. I suspect this is what the problem is. Does anyone have a solution? <comment166976> I think the simple question I want to ask is - is there a way of mapping the copy and paste commands across all applications on a Mac so I can use the control key instead of the command key <comment166982> Does [this](http://superuser.com/a/81843/141595) solve it? <comment167150> Yes but it messes up the keyboard layout when using RDP into a Windows Machine so I wrote a script which swaps the keyboard layout so I can quickly change it when I have to work in a virtual machine. I'll see how that works.
