Data being sent to old and new iphone <body> When I bought my iphone 6s the store put the sim card from my 5c into my new phone. I gave my old phone to my granddaughter just for the games that were already on it. When I get info on my new phone the same goes to the 5c as well. This includes photos, text messages, Amber alerts, etc. Can I do something so she can still use the games and take photos of her own (just for fun) and play games but not get my texts?  <answer259321> You should have reset the phone when giving it to someone else. Go to:  ol liSettings/li liGeneral/li liReset/li liErase all content and settings/li /ol  This will ensure that all of your data is removed, and the device is no longer associated with any of your accounts.  <answer259322> On your old phone, go to Settings  Messages and disable iMessage.  On your new phone, go to Settings  Messages and check if text message forwarding is enabled; check what devices are selected as recipients and remove the old phone if it is there.  Better yet, reset the old iPhone:  ul liGo to Settings  General  Reset  Erase All Content and Settings/li liSet up your iPhone as new./li liCreate a new Apple ID to your grand child./li /ul  She will have her own Apple ID to set up iCloud and other services independently (for instance, saving and migrating game progress with her account). You will have separate iCloud accounts and passwords; photos and other personal information that may end up mixed is now on different accounts.  The only disadvantage is that she will have to download the games again and start from scratch.  Optional: Set up Family Sharing.  ul liGo to Settings  iCloud./li liTap Set Up Family Sharing, then tap Get Started./li liConfirm that you want to be the family organizer and that you're signed in with your personal Apple ID./li liFollow the onscreen instructions./li /ul  You can then invite her to your Family:  ul liGo to Settings  iCloud  Family  Add Family Member./li liEnter your family member's name or email address./li liFollow the onscreen instructions. /li /ul  If she is younger than 13, follow the instructions described here: Family Sharing and Apple ID for your child  Setting up Family Sharing will allow you to share games and other apps with her (you don't have to buy them again). You can also set up restrictions if you need to.  <comment324467> This doesn't resolve the issue, though, because without further instructions, how would the OP know she needs to set up a new Apple ID for her granddaughter to actually stop the issue she's having?
