Mono not working <body> I had 2 versions of Mono installed, one via Homebrew, the other downloaded from Mono website (http://www.mono-project.com).  This was causing issues with versions, so I tried removing both.  I uninstalled Homebrew with codebrew uninstall mono/code and the other one with   precodesudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework sudo pkgutil --forget com.xamarin.mono-MDK.pkg sudo rm -rf /etc/paths.d/mono-commands /code/pre  (as per website instructions.)  I then re-downloaded and installed the latest package from http://www.mono-project.com. It installed successfully, but when I try to codemono/code from Terminal, I get code/usr/local/bin/mono: No such file or directory/code  I tried codebrew unlink mono/code and codebrew rm mono/code, but still nothing.  <answer281721> Solution from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32542535/how-to-install-mono-on-macos-so-mono-works-in-terminal  precodeexport PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/Current/bin/:${PATH} /code/pre  <comment354484> I have only used mono once and it was glitchy.  I believe there is Visual Studio(or whatever they call it) for mac now.  That would surely work better. <comment354485> I need it to run other packages, not for development
