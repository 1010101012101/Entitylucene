Where is the sound file of Installer success stored? <body> I've tracked codeInstaller.app/code to be located at code/System/Library/CoreServices//code but I can't find the sound that plays after a successful installation.  I've looked at the following paths:  ul licode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Install.framework/code/li licode/System/Library/CoreServices/Installer.app/code/li licode/System/Library/Sounds/code/li /ul  Where is that sound file located?  <answer245457> The install success sound is usually just your default system notification sound (i.e., Glass or whatever you have set).  If you want to set a custom sound, make sure it's in AIFF format, place it in one of these locations and choose the sound from System Preferences  Sound  Sound Effects  precode/System/Library/Sounds/ /Library/Sounds/ /Users/&lt; username &gt;/Library/Sounds/ /code/pre  <answer245797> The file you are looking for (on El Capitan) is located in: code/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/SharedSupport/SystemSounds/system//code  Specifically, the file is codeburn complete.aif/code (or codeburn failed.aif/code, they're identical).  Older versions of OS X (unknown when it changed) have it at (source): code/System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component/Contents/Resources/SystemSounds/system//code  <comment302586> Can also be *.m4r (MP4 Ringtone Format) <comment302757> I checked the system sounds but it's not any of them. The system sounds are also listed in my initial question in the path `/System/Library/Sounds` <comment303087> Thanks! I would like to know how you tracked this down so I can add it to my mental tools. <comment303088> @radj Looked near the old path which was mentioned in that link (I just updated). Without that information, a common technique for finding files is typing a file type into Finder (if indexed), or running `find [DIR] -type f -name '*.[FILE_EXT]'` in Terminal, using your desired directory and file extension.
