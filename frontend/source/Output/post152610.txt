Memory upgrade for 27" iMac, mid 2011 <body> I recently upgraded the memory in my 27" iMac, mid 2011.  took out the two, 2 gig in the top slots &amp; put in two 8 gig units.  For some reason I wasn't thinking about putting the 2 gig units in the bottom slots.  Is this ok? Will it help any?  Thanks  <answer152612> It will likely work, however many people will advice you to only use matching sticks of RAM.  In other words, if you're going to use 4 sticks, ensure they are all of the speed, capacity, brand, etc.  You wouldn't build a RAID array with mismatched drive manufacturers, speeds, and capacities, why do it with your RAM?  <comment179719> Actually, neither capacity nor brand are important, if speed, ECC etc all match & each *pair* are truly identical. My machine runs perfectly happily on a pair of 1s, a pair of 4s, & a pair of 8s, giving the odd total of 26GB RAM. <comment179739> Thanks guys.  I think I will install them & see how it goes.
