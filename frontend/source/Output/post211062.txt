Repeated crashes of 'suggestd' <body> I've been running OS X 10.11 without issues since it was released — until today, when codesuggestd/code began repeatedly crashing (from every few minutes, up to every 30 seconds).  What is codesuggestd/code and how do I disable it (since it's only function appears to be to crash)?  hr  precodeProcess:               suggestd [23293] Path:                  /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreSuggestions.framework/Versions/A/Support/suggestd Identifier:            suggestd Version:               1.0 (354.10) Code Type:             X86-64 (Native) Parent Process:        ???

That also deleted code~/Library/Suggestions/harvestqueueold/code, which was previously filled by what looked like a bunch of temporary files. I'm going to try turning it back on now and see if the crashes resume.  <comment254785> [looking at this thread at Apple](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7264893), it suggests to do something with your new "`~/Library/Suggestions/`" folder.  However, in my just updated-to-MacOS10.11 machine, I don't have a Suggestions folder in there.  And SIP (System Integrity Protection) is refusing to allow me to create an empty one.  I'm getting tempted to downgrade back to Yosemite. <comment254933> after disabling SIP and managing to create a "`Suggestions`" folder, my constantly appearing crash logs for suggestd stopped.  yay! <comment254988> @MichaelDautermann: Wow, I hope that's not the only fix. I'm reluctant to mess with what Apple just locked down. I worry will create other problems down the road. <comment275937> Are you still on 10.11.0? Have Apple fixed this in a dot update without you messing with SIP? Also ~/Library is **not under SIP restrictions** so what folder are you creating @MichaelDautermann
