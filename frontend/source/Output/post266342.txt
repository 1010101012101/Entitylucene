Turned off whatsapp iCloud backup when it has already started <body> Yesterday I accidentally deleted one of conversations in Whatsapp. So to recover it I decided to restore Whatsapp using iCloud backup. But when I reach the whatsapp chat settings I saw that Whatsapp already has started backing up to iCloud. But I'm 100% sure it was began after the conversation Deletion. So I stopped backup by turning off Mobile data and decided to turn off auto backup.  Note : When I turned the backup off it was at 49%  strongProblem/strong  Since I've turned that off I see last backup as never and total is unknown. I've inserted a screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JL4vA.png" width="280"   So I'm worried that whether I've totally lost that conversation.  I don't know whether I should recover from that backup or not.  What I wanna know ;  1) Is that backup corrupted now?   2) Does whatsapp delete old backup permanently after the recent one uploaded 100% ?  I cannot risk my new conversation details too by recovering iCloud halfly uploaded backup. But if I can download past conversation ( which was deleted accidentally ) I can do something to get new conversation details after recovering through iCloud  Please help me. I have lots more company contact details and information stored in that conversation. I contacted Apple but said to contact whatsapp. Seems like whatsapp is not reachable now because of holidays. Can someone help me please?
