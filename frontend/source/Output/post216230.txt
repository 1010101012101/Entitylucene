The problem seemed to be the corrupt or missing creation date. After setting it manually the folder was acting normal again. I used the codeSetFile/code command from XCode's command line tools. So this should solve the issue:  precodeSetFile -d '12/31/1999 23:59:59' will-not-open /code/pre  <comment261249> All files/folders show Jan24 1984 when copying & until the copy is complete. It's a reference to the date of Steve Jobs' announcement of the first Mac.
