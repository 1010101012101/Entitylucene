Sharing keyboard/mouse via software with another computer? <body> I have my workstation with Windows and a MacBook with Mac OS X which I attach to the same monitor. The monitor provides the switching but I don't want to have two keyboards and two mouses and neither use an external switch (already enough cables).  Is there a solution. The keyboard needs to stay attached to the windows desktop, so it must be a network software solution on the Apple side.  <answer178962> I'm not sure if it will fit this specific use case but if you can forego the shared monitor, you can use a tool like Synergy or Share Mouse.   FWIW, I've used Synergy before across 3 computers and it worked well.
