Unable to access Mac OS X Lion server on web <body> I have the Mac OS X Lion server and am able to view on my iMac, however when I go on a different computer i am unable to see it.  website: wiki.piezosystems.org  <answer41226> If you only want to be able to access the website on your internal network, you can add the IP address of your server to the list of DNS servers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9lld.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment46691> I'm guessing from the limited information here that your DNS is not set up correctly. <comment46692> how should i setup the DNS <comment46693> just put your picture on a sharing site and post a link. You can flag it for a moderator to embed the link if needed or just wait until a reader with edit authority notices the link. In the mean time, do check the server app to try changing the local host name to match wiki.piezosystems.org - I see your DNS for www. but not wiki. so you might need to check DNS records to point to wiki. <comment46695> You probably need to enter a CNAME record for _wiki_ pointing to the server at _piezosystems.org_  FWIW getting DNS **right** is the most important thing in getting your server to work correctly. <comment49492> Yeah and if it's your local host you can't access? I can get access to the default website that comes with the Lion Server but when I add new ones to use as development sites, I can't get to them. It's driving me batty... Every now and then it will work but most of the time it doesn't.
