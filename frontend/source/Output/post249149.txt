dd wont write more than 4.3 Gb <body> I'm following this tutorial: How to create a bootable, persistent Ubuntu USB stick for Mac  I'm using a 64 GB SanDisk USB with a GUID and formatted as FAT32. I'm trying to make a bootable Ubuntu thumb drive with persistence.  When I'm using the following command to write the persistence:  precodedd if=/dev/zero of=/Volumes/USB/casper-rw bs=1m count=X /code/pre  It won't go any higher than 4.3 GB even though the partition is 45 GB.  If I then try to format the device so I have the whole 64Gb instead of parting it, it's still the same.  Anyone who has experienced this before?  <comment308939> how is it formatted? GUID/MBR, FAT16,32, extFS...? <comment308940> sorry... fat32, Guid <comment308941> FAT32 has a 4GB file-size limit... though there's always the possibility the USB is not what it claims to be. Cheap ones from eBay etc can be like that <comment308942> Might be worth testing - http://oss.digirati.com.br/f3/ <comment308945> Thank you Tetsujin i did not know that! what format would you reccomend for this? <comment308990> To format that whole 64GB flash, you can use ExFAT which as has a limitation of 128 peta bytes
