Move notification center to the left <body> Is there a way to move the OsX notification center, or at least the notification alerts, to the left side of the screen?  <answer177547> Simple answer: No. The UI clearly states there is only one location:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nUBWS.png" alt="enter image description here"  and there appear to be no preferences one can set through the UI, or anywhere else, for that matter, to move it elsewhere.
