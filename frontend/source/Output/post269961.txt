AddressBookSourceSync & VPNs <body> My question is in regard to VPN usage, cyber security and AddressBookSourceSync.  I understand that AddressBookSourceSync is a feature of Bonjour, which is used for local networking (forgive my limited understanding, am n00b plz halp). Have already referenced this: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3355782?start=15&amp;tstart=0  I have little snitch installed, and my network monitor very regularly (every few seconds or so) shows "AddressBookSourceSync" firing off.  So, if you were to allow it to call home while using a VPN, wouldn't it call home emthrough/em that VPN connection, thus de-anonymizing (at least partially) VPN activity by showing the IP of the VPN server (and by extension determine which activity came from which computer through numerous investigative techniques, i.e. packet analysis)?  To recapitulate and put concisely:  ol liis AddressBookSourceSync a privacy nuke or vulnerability?/li liif so, is AddressBookSourceSync necessary to the core functionality of OSX?/li liif not, can it be turned off?/li liif so, what are the pros/cons of turning if off?/li /ol
