Why do I need a credit card when I am downloading a free app from the app store on a iPad mini? <body> I am trying to download a free app but it keeps telling me to provide a credit card. I try to avoid it but it won't let me and I don't have a credit card.  How can I use App Store without a credit card?  <answer107997> I don't know of any way to set up an existing Apple ID for use with the App Store without supplying a credit card (or other payment source) (unless it's an iCloud account, I think -- it's not completely consistent). Don't ask me why this is, it makes no sense to me. There are a couple of ways to set up a paymentless account though:  ul liCreate a new Apple ID account as part of the purchase of a free app (see Apple Support article HT2534). You'll need to sign out of your current Apple ID, then start purchasing a free app, and tap Create New Apple ID when asked what ID to use.  This means that your App Store "purchases" will be under a different Apple ID than whatever you have set up under your current ID, but since they're free apps anyway, that's not too big a deal. If you want to purchase non-free apps later, you can always add a credit card (or iTunes gift card or whatever) to your old Apple ID and do those purchases under it, but it may be a bit alloying to have to maintain multiple identities. Note that the new Apple ID will have to be linked to a verified email address (other than the one your current ID is linked to)./li liAdd a credit card to your current Apple ID, "buy" a free app, then change the account's payment type to "none" (see Apple Support article HT1918). Since you never actually buy anything, the card never gets charged. I haven't really experimented with this option, but AIUI you can continue to purchase free apps under the account even after the credit card is removed./li /ul  <answer108000> I don't know the answer to "how can I use App Store without a credit card", but I think I can partly answer the "why" question in your title.  The reason is that credit card, apart from being a source of payment, is also a way to identify your country or region. For instance, with a U.S. credit card you can make purchases in the U.S. App Store, but with a Chinese credit card you can'tâ€”you need to go to the Chinese App Store. Why? Because different countries and regions are subject to different terms of services on the App Store, even for free apps.  I hope the credit card thing isn't all that ridiculous now.  <comment126936> Should I merge this answer onto the existing question on "why" no payment options seem to require a credit card? <comment126944> @bmike: Sure; I didn't see [that question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7036/why-am-i-asked-for-a-credit-card-number-to-download-a-free-app) when I posed my answer here. <comment126947> Perfect - I just wanted a second set of eyes to make sure they are truly duplicate since un-merging is not easy and not something elected moderators can do.
