My Facebook "click to post" in the notification center is not working. (Mac OSX 10.8.3) <body> When i click the "click to tweet" button, it works, but when i click the "click to post", nothing happens---plus my twitter button wont work afterwards. :( so i have to restart my mac again. tried removing my fb account then adding it again, but still doesn't work.  Any solutions?  <comment100325> Try logging off from Faceboom in System Prefrences and log back in. Could be an authentication issue. <comment100342> In your FB set it up to accept the application. In the security log in approvals !
