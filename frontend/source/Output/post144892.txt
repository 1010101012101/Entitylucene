How can I add a ipfw forward rule to little snitch? <body> I use the following rules to connect to my nginx server on a vagrant machine:  precodesudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8080 tcp from any to me 80 sudo ipfw add 100 fwd 127.0.0.1,8090 tcp from any to me 443 /code/pre  after installing little snitch, it seems to have made ipfw useless and i can't figure out how to apply a forward rule to little snitch?  <answer146397> Since ipfw is also removed in Yosemite the solution is to use pf  create a file in /etc/pf.anchors/  e.g. com.myapp  precoderdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 8080 /code/pre  NOTE: Add a trailing line break. Otherwise pf will say you have a syntax error.  edit /etc/pf.conf add right after coderdr-anchor "com.apple/*"/code:  precoderdr-anchor "myapp" /code/pre  and after codeload anchor "com.apple" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.apple"/code:  precodeload anchor "myap" from "/etc/pf.anchors/com.myapp" /code/pre  NOTE: Add a trailing line break. Otherwise pf will say you have a syntax error.  Next, reload the rules into pf by running codesudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf/code  Finally, enable pf by running codesudo pfctl -e/code  Source: https://github.com/basecamp/pow/issues/452  <comment170716> little snitch is blocking it ? the incoming traffic ! <comment170862> no it just seems that it ignores ipfw rules. calling 127.0.0.1:8080 works
