Upgrade this iMac to the latest version of Os X? <body> I have an iMac running 10.5.8. How well/badly do you think it would work if I upgrade to the most recent version of MacOsX (and can I leap there in one go, or do I need to first upgrade to an intermediate version of the operating system)?  Here is what System Profiler tells me:  precode   - Model Name: iMac    - Model Identifier: iMac5,2    - Processor Name: Intel Core 2 Duo    - Processor Speed: 1.83 GHz    - Number Of Processors: 1    - Total Number Of Cores: 2    - L2 Cache: 2 MB    - Memory: 2 GB    - Bus Speed: 667 MHz    - Boot ROM Version: IM52.0090.B09    - SMC Version (system): 1.6f0    - Serial Number (system): W86450CMWV7    - Hardware UUID: 00000000-0000-1000-8000-0016CBA120C3 /code/pre  Thanks for your help.  <answer99606> From Apple's site:     If you’re running OS X Leopard and would like to upgrade to OS X Mountain Lion, first you’ll need to upgrade to OS X Snow Leopard. You can purchase OS X Snow Leopard here.   <answer99607> Gonna be tight, if I was to upgrade to 10.8 on that, I would be looking to max the RAM out to whatever is supported (it's old RAM, shouldn't be at a premium for DDR2 yet), and I would also look to inserting an SSD as the boot disk.  Other than that, the CPU is just fine, it will never fly, but it's faster than my 1.6Ghz Core 2 Duo running in my MBA with 4Gb and an SSD.  <comment117190> That said, I don't think iMac 5,2 can run ML anyway. I'll have to verify that. <comment117191> Duplicate/Related question [Upgrade from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99393/upgrade-from-10-5-8-to-mountain-lion/99395#99395). You have a late 2006, which **cannot run** Mountain Lion. See my answer on the link.
