App Store repeatedly asking me to update <body> I have run into a frustrating problem with my App Store. I recently installed slightly older versions of Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Xcode and App Store prompted me to update them to newer versions. I complied and the apps finally got updated albeit it took me an abnormally long time despite being on a high-speed broadband connection.  However, next time I tried running one of these applications, they seemed to have reverted back to their older versions and App Store automatically started updating them again. I let it complete â€“ ALL OVER AGAIN, hoping it to be the last time I was having to do this. But the same problem again! Why are apps falling back to older versions after being updated through App Store? Is there any workaround?  <answer129789> h1Yes! Absolutely./h1  Please note, I have merely copied verbatim my answer from here and added a clip from here  These instructions are for use in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app  Just open Terminal.app, and follow along!  h2Happy Administrating!/h2  The App Store is simply not suitable for administration. Barely a quasi-package manager, it is not nearly as useful or reliable as real package managers like pkgsrc, FreeBSD ports, aptitude, RPM, macports or even softwareupdate. In my experience, it is unpredictable and a beard for commercial developers to hock their wares. So there is really only one rational and responsible way, as a competent administrator, to work with App Store:  precode sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.store_helper.plist   sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.storeagent.plist   sudo mkdir /System/Library/LaunchAgents\ \(disabled\)/   sudo mv /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.store* /System/Library/LaunchAgents\ \(disabled\)/ /code/pre  And just put it out of your mind, it won't trouble you any longer. ;-)  hr  h2softwareupdate/h2  In order to update your Apple Software, you can use softwareupdate.  precode man softwareupdate           # softwareupdate man page   softwareupdate -h            # softwareupdate help    softwareupdate -l            # list available updates   sudo softwareupdare -i -r    # use this install all recommended updates /code/pre  hr  h3MacPorts/h3  If you're looking for a mature package management solution, for OS X I recommend MacPorts. MacPorts requires an appropriate version of xcode; xcode_5.1.1.dmg is the most recent version for Mavericks.   Get to know  MacPorts  h2Install MacPorts/h2  precode curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2   tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2   cd MacPorts-2.2.1   ./configure   make   sudo make install     # *not war!*   cd ..   rm -rf Macports-*   sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate /code/pre  h3add MacPorts to your $PATH:/h3  precode export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH /code/pre  If for whatever reason you need to remove MacPorts  h3to completely uninstall MacPorts/h3  precode sudo port -dfp uninstall --follow-dependencies installed   sudo port -dfp uninstall all   sudo rm -rf /opt/local     sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/macports* /code/pre  hr  h2Apple Remote Desktop/h2  And/or use ARD instead, though not a package manager, it manages packages, installations, updates, and upgrades, it will do what you want, save you time, and will not let you down:  For Apple Remote Desktop 3, for 10.9:  Check out the admin guide first to convince yourself that this is the way to go:  precodecurl -Ok http://images.apple.com/ca/fr/remotedesktop/pdf/ARD3_AdminGuide.pdf      open ARD3_AdminGuide.pdf /code/pre  Then install:  precodecurl -Ok http://supportdownload.apple.com/download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Mac_OS_X/downloads/031-2845.20140313.rerft/RemoteDesktopAdmin372.dmg  hdiutil attach -quiet -noverify -nobrowse -noautoopen RemoteDesktopAdmin372.dmg  sudo installer -pkg /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.7.2\ Admin\ Update/RemoteDesktopAdmin372.pkg -target / /code/pre  but that might throw a funny error if not running 10.9, or if no previous version of ARD is installed, and if it does, try:  precodepkgutil --expand /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.7.2\ Admin\ Update/RemoteDesktopAdmin372.pkg ARDexpanded/ /code/pre  or to equal effect (either/or here, don't need to use both pkgutil and xar... I'm just being thorough):   precodemkdir ARDexpanded  cd ARDexpanded  xar -xf /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.7.2\ Admin\ Update/RemoteDesktopAdmin372.pkg /code/pre  And we no longer need the disk image attached, so eject it:  precodehdiutil detach -quiet /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.7.2\ Admin\ Update/ /code/pre  And now what you'll see if you  precodecd ARDexpanded/RemoteDesktopAdmin372.pkg/  ls /code/pre  is    precode    Bom         PackageInfo Payload     Scripts /code/pre  What's in the Payload file, which is a cpio archive compressed with gzip, is what you're after. So with a few piped commands we can get to the app bundle:  precodecat Payload | gzip -d - | cpio -id  ls /code/pre  returns:  precode    Applications Bom          Library      PackageInfo  Payload      Scripts /code/pre  And you're nearly done.  precodecp -R Applications/Remote\ Desktop.app /Applications/ /code/pre  Now you have installed Apple Remote Desktop Admin 3.7.2  So all that's left to do is purchase your license:  precodeopen http://store.apple.com/us_smb_78313/product/D6020Z/A/apple-remote-desktop-3-volume-licenses-20-seats-price-is-per-seat /code/pre  Launch /Applications/Remote\ Desktop.app and serialize. And get some work done.  hr  For 10.6 Snow Leopard, you'll need a slightly earlier version of ARD:  precodecurl -Ok http://images.apple.com/ca/fr/remotedesktop/pdf/ARD3_AdminGuide.pdf  curl -Ok http://supportdownload.apple.com/download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/Mac_OS_X/downloads/041-6789.20120917.xD6TR/RemoteDesktopAdmin353.dmg  hdiutil attach -quiet -noverify -nobrowse -noautoopen RemoteDesktopAdmin353.dmg  sudo installer -pkg /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.5.3\ Admin\ Update/RemoteDesktopAdmin353.pkg -target / /code/pre  and if it throws back at you this:  precode    installer: Cannot install on volume / because it is disabled.     installer: This update could not find Remote Desktop on this volume. /code/pre  then try:  precodepkgutil --expand /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.5.3\ Admin\ Update/RemoteDesktopAdmin353.pkg ARD353  hdiutil detach -quiet /Volumes/Apple\ Remote\ Desktop\ 3.5.3\ Admin\ Update /code/pre  drill down to the Payload:  precode    cd ARD353/RemoteDesktopAdmin353.pkg/      ls /code/pre  returns:   precode    Bom         PackageInfo Payload     Scripts /code/pre  So run:  precodecat Payload | gzip -d - | cpio -id  ls /code/pre  returns:   precodeApplications Bom          Library      PackageInfo  Payload      Scripts /code/pre  And you're nearly done:  precodecp -R Applications/Remote\ Desktop.app /Applications/ /code/pre  purchase your license:  precodeopen http://store.apple.com/us_smb_78313/product/D6020Z/A/apple-remote-desktop-3-volume-licenses-20-seats-price-is-per-seat /code/pre  Launch /Applications/Remote\ Desktop.app and serialize. And get something done.  <comment151897> All Greek and Latin to a layman like me  but thanks for your efforts! <comment151906> While this is an excellent answer, it just circumnavigates the OP's question. <comment151908> @ Amit Schandillia: No effort at all, just a bit of cut and paste! @Hawken Rives: I was answering the question "Is there any workaround?" Thx. <comment151909> @chillin: well, that certainly qualifies as a workaround! I should investigate using it for my own comps... <comment151912> If it seems at all like I may have a hidden agenda, I assure it is nothing nefarious, but only to coax Apple into returning administrative control of the System to the home user or the IT staff of the enterprise user by showing what is still possible regardless of Apple's continuing lock downs. The image translators work for the construct program - but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. In my experience, once automation and feature creep reach past a certain point, it begins to aggrivate and work against the possibility of rational computing.
