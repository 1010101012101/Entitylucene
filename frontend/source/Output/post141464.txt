How Do I Change The Colour Of The Apple Icon In The Menu Bar <body> The apple icon in the menu bar is a black gradient (everything on this MacBook Pro seems to be a shade of grey!).  How can I change the icon to use the classic fruit colours instead?  <answer141471> Here's a youtube video that covers how to do this in Mountain Lion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8wqOkrlX5Q  It appears to be the same in mavericks.  The easier way to get to the folders in Finder is click Go  Go to Folder, or hit Shift-Command-G and in the window type code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/LoginUIKit.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LoginUICore.framework/Versions/A/Resources/code and the other folder is code/System/Library/CoreServices/code.  The files in Mavericks seemed to be named codeapple_s1.png/code, codeapple_s1@2x.png/code, codeapple.png/code and codeapple@2x.png/code.  Good luck  <comment166710> Something like this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8wqOkrlX5Q <comment166714> There are some additional challenges in actually editing these files to change the color. <comment166745> Actually, the only part I need to change the Apple Icon in the Menu Bar is to install http://www.sigsoftware.com/classicmenu/ then in the preferences select "Show system Apple menu when: - Mouse within: - Inside" <comment168422> Yeah, there is usually some software out there that does what you want, but sometimes it's fun to get your hands dirty in the system files, lol.
