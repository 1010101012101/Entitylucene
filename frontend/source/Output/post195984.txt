dtrace replacement for fseventer? <body> I think many of us have been disappointed with the effective demise of codefseventer/code.  What is a good codedtrace/code shell based alternative to codefseventer/code that will display all full paths of files being accessed for a defined application?  <answer196170> They're not quite a 100% fit, but if you'd like to monitor file access for an application I find a combination of codeopensnoop/code and codefs_usage/code works well. Only codeopensnoop/code uses DTrace though.  <comment234327> Yeah, I have explored both of those rather heavily, but I fear that I'm not getting full path information at times.  Have you seen any indication of how thorough `opensnoop` actually is as far as actually getting the full and complete paths?  One thing I did not realize before today was that I can actually use `opensnoop` with a `-n name` argument of a not yet existent process name and it will then attach to the process after it is running, which may do the job.
