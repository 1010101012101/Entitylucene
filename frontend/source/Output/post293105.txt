Why does this PDF not render properly on / crash Preview? <body> This pdf, the manual for the R package codeknitr/code (also presumably embuild/em in codeknitr/code, then passed to codetexi2pdf/code), does not render properly on Preview in Mac OS.  The first couple of pages end up being blurred, and the last pages are not rendered at all. After a while, Preview just crashes.  The same can be observed with Skim, though not with Adobe Acrobat on Mac OS.  Any ideas what's going on here?  (I'm also raising an issue over at the codeknitr/code repo, just want to make sure that the problem is reproducible.)  This is:  ul liMacOS 10.12.6/li liPreview 9.0/li liSkim 1.4.29/li liAdobe Acrobat Reader DC 2017.009.20059 (not affected)/li /ul  <comment369813> I just had the same problem.  The file opened fine in Acrobat Reader but not in Preview.  Only 1st 4 pages appeared in Preview and it has problems with the animation on page 6.  Maybe the animation is causing the problem. <comment369815> The PDF works fine for me in Preview 8.1, but the animation on page 6 doesn't work. In Preview 9 I get the same problem as you. Using Adobe Acrobat Pro works fine, although it pauses a little when first opening p6 and auto-playing the animation. <comment369819> Woah since when can pdfs have animations? Also for another data point it works fine in preview 7. I'm assuming it might be related to the pdfkit issues that crop up with every release.
