External Hard Drive Unreadable after Windows 10 Disc Management <body> I was trying to transfer files from my mac formatted external hard drive to a back up drive formatted for PC on a windows 10 computer.  HSF Explorer could not find the hard drive as a device.  I tried to examine the problem in Disc Management and clicked on a number of tabs.  I must have inadvertently changed the format of the hard drive as it is now unreadable on my imac now. The Imac Disc Utilities cannot repair it and the Western Digital Utilities deep scan failed.  The drive has school files, family photos and itunes collection so I hope to regain the files.  Any suggestions?  <comment334771> Can your Windows PC read the files?
