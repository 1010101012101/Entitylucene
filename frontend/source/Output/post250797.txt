Chromecast receiver for OSX <body> Is there a working Chromecast receiver for OSX. ie I could send audio or video from a phone or another PC to stream on there laptop?  I know there were some experiments previously, but not sure anything is working now.  <answer250912> Several options include:  ul liReflector 2/li liAirServer Universal/li /ul  And if you feel brave and are able to compile Python, LeapCast may be an option.   Hope this helps.   <comment332663> looks like LeapCast is no longer work
