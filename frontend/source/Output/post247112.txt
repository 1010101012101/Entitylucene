0 photos and videos taking up 4GB of iCloud space <body> I've seen a similar issue from other people but nothing seems to help.  I got a new iPhone to replace my old one a couple months ago and haven't been able to back it up.  My iCloud storage says it's too full.  I went on iCloud.com (I have a PC, no Mac) and saw it was photos hogging up 3.95GB of space.  I deleted them all off iCloud.com and then went into the deleted photos and deleted them from there.    When I went to manage storage in my iPhone, it stated that 0 photos and 0 videos were taking up 3.95GB of storage.  Huh?  Online, it also shows photos and videos are taking up that much space.  Once again, there are NONE on iCloud, I double checked online.  What is going on?  I don't have a problem just putting any new photos on a junk drive instead of backing them up, but where is all this data being used?  I also checked, the "documents" section is using a few hundred MB, but the bulk is shown to be coming from non-existent photos.
