Why does my MacBook's monitor go to maximum brightness when waking up from sleep? <body> I have my MacBook connected to an external monitor (via HDMI), and the brightness of MacBook monitor is set to 50% of max brightness . I usually put my display to sleep when I leave my computer for a break, and everytime I wake it up, the MacBook monitor will be set to maximum again.   Any idea how do I fix it so that when I wake up the display, I do not need to adjust the screen brightness down again?  I am running Lion on an early 2009 MacBook.  <answer40533> Try to reset the System Management Controller.     h3Resetting the SMC on Mac portables with a battery you can remove/h3      ol   liShut down the computer./li   liDisconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the computer, if it's connected./li   liRemove the battery./li   liPress and hold the power button for 5 seconds./li   liRelease the power button./li   liReconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter./li   liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li   /ol   <comment45854> Will try that once I got home.
