Why is the photo quality terrible in Automator? <body> I am trying to use Automator as a Photo Booth but when I use the codevideo snapshot/code command the photo quality is terrible. The built in camera is fine in other apps such as Skype or Photo Booth? I can't find anything online about this.  <answer99011> I don't know why, but it seems to save the image as a 201x201 pixel tiff file.  You could also install codeimagesnap/code with codebrew install imagesnap/code and then use something like code/usr/local/bin/imagesnap ~/Desktop/$(date +%y%m%d%H%M%S).png/code in a Run Shell Script action.
