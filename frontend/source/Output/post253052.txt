iOS 10 photos removing individual photo from people folders <body> How do I remove a photo that has accidentally been put in the wrong people photo album? I have a photo of my dad (who is now deceased) that has appeared in the album for my father-in-law (who is very much alive). I can't find a way to remove an individual photo from the new people album once it is in it. I don't want to hide the whole album of my father-in-law, just remove this one misfiled photo.   <answer253053> Select your father-in-law from the "People" album, tap the "Select" button in the upper right-hand corner, tap on the mislabeled photo, tap the "Share" icon in the bottom left, then from the list at the bottom of the screen select "Not This Person."  If you need to select multiple photos, check all applicable pictures from the scrollable list at the top of the Share sheet prior to pressing "Not This Person."  <answer269459> As above 'Select your father-in-law from the "People" album, tap the "Select" button in the upper right-hand corner, tap on the mislabeled photo, tap the "Share" icon in the bottom left, then from the list at the bottom of the screen select "Not This Person.".  If you cannot see 'Not This Person' in the list, try swiping left to see more options or tapping 'More'  <answer273198> The "Not This Person" option only shows up if you select the person from the "People" album, and not through the Spotlight search.  <comment315645> Have a screenshot? I'm not seeing the "Not this Person" option (iOS 10.0.1). <comment338468> This doesn't seem to add anything to the accepted answer?
