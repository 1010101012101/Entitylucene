Has the Apple ID asking for a "Non-existing" account been solved? <body> My iPhone and iPad keep asking me to sign in to an old account that is associated with an old email address that is not available anymore. (Old Bell.net email.  I'm using Yahoo now) I tried to use Apple ID to get into it and change the email, but lo &amp; behold, Apple ID says it doesn't exist!  I read that this may be a bug with iCloud, but can't find any more about that or a solution.  I do use another account that  uses my "new" email, but a lot of the time when I try to do something in the App Store, it asks for this old ID! Quite often my devices will ask for the ID out of the blue.  How can I "remove" or make my iPhone/iPad use the "new" ID? It is VERY frustrating.  I have the latest iOS's and all that.br Both devices show the "new" ID as the primary ID, but since the old one doesn't exist I can't even access it to change or remove it! Has this "bug" been addressed and a solution made available? Thanks!  <comment328311> When does the device ask you to sign in? Is it by chance when updating certain apps? Or do you have automatic download of app updates activated?
