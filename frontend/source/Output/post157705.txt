Game Center, can't sign up IOS 6.1.6 Ipod touch 4th gen <body> I have an Ipod touch 4th Gen on ver 6.1.6, it is not jailbroken. Whenever I try to sign in I get these results  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZJYOd.jpg" alt="Logging in"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnPRw.jpg" alt="loading"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sLuiE.jpg" alt="And nothing"  I don't know why it won't work, I have tried factory resetting it, using 3 different Wi-Fi networks, and a bunch of other stuff, but it won't get past that third picture.  I have a old Game Center account, and I can sign in with it, but I refuse to use it because the nickname is hella embarrassing, when I sign in with it I can play games fine, however there is one thing when I try clicking on "account: (my old email)" then "View Account" and then it just loads, then gets stuck on that same green screen I would get stuck on when trying to sign in with my new Apple ID  Edit: I am editing it to show you all what I meant in my last paragraph  Signed in with my old account  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N8ITN.jpg" alt="Signing in"  Selecting "view account" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qGpRZ.jpg" alt="View Account"  and then I get that same blank screen, and it doesn't load anything, I waited for 5 minutes.  So I think both of them stem from the same problem, any help would be appreciated.  <answer157824> Just had this problem with an iPod running iOS 6.1.6.  Here are the steps I followed to fix it.  ol liLog into Game Center on a friend's device (must be iOS 7 or greater)./li liAccept the terms and conditions and create Game Center profile.  Once profile is created, log out of Game Center./li liOn the iOS 6 device, sign out of your Apple account used by your device and then sign back in./li liLaunch Game Center and sign in./li /ol  Basically, iOS 6.1.6 is having issues when new Game Center users need to create their profile for the first time.  <answer157963> I was getting exactly the same issue on my son's 4th Gen touch with IOS 6.1.6. This was a new Games Center ID.  The fix was to log on with a friends Macbook and connect to Games Center on that. It then let me set-up his nickname and complete the account. I then logged out of Games Center.  Following this Games Center on the ipod has been working fine.  <comment185458> The dashed circle near the WiFi symbol in the third screenshot means it is still loading something. Does that persist indefinitely? <comment185461> No it goes away really quickly, usually stays for less then 30 seconds. <comment185820> Okay thanks for the answer, that really sucks though, I never use macs, don't like them, and so I guess I am just screwed, thanks apple :) Edit: actually, could probably borrow my brothers Iphone, and create the profile on there, sign out, and then sign in on mine, stupid solution but it would probably work
