How can I automatically disable WiFi when I connect to an Ethernet network? <body> I would like my WiFi to automatically disconnect when I plug an Ethernet cable into my Mac. How would I go about this?  <answer64454> If you have somehow modified the default service ordering, you can set it again in the network tab using the gear.  This makes the Wi-Fi inactive for internet routing whenever you connect the cable. What you ask is scriptable if you know some programming, but there isn't a simple trigger to actually turn the Wi-Fi radio off at the user level of the OS.  <answer107845> This script on MacOSXHints worked for me up until installing Mavericks (10.9.0) on a new Late 2013 MBP retina 15" - but it did work quite well on my previous two non-retina MBPs before that.  Note that you may need to edit the script to use your correct interface numbers (ie en1).  <comment75682> Could you put some more effort into describing "Cable" and how you have things set up? Ethernet, Cable Modem, some other cable? OS X handles multiple network interfaces without any intervention so it's not clear what you are even trying to accomplish. <comment75684> Cable ethernet, i mean! <comment75715> Do you want to have the entire WiFi system turn off when you connect the Ethernet cable? Also: I edited your question. Is it still correct? <comment123041> The question makes a lot of sense to me: how to turn off the wifi radio when going on to ethernet. There are a lot of busy office wifi environments where it'd be beneficial. <comment211543> Any way to do this on 10.9 and up?  Service order has no effect on my machine. Some operations still default to to WiFi.
