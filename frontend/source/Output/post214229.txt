How to make a Mac forget it ever saw an iOS device? <body> I need this just to be able to test how the machine responds to the first time a device is plugged in - without needing an unlimited supply of 'new' devices.  I connected a 'foreign' iPad [my partner's, not synced to this machine but to her own] to test Photos app's response.  It auto-launched.    Now I want to try again, let it 'see' the device for the first time - so I'm trying to discover what keeps the record of which devices were connected &amp; if I can clean it of just one device without damaging my regular devices' behaviour.  Closest I can find is How do I make iTunes 'forget' a device in Mavericks? which has some discussion regarding Sync Services - but I'm not sure if that's heading in the right direction.  Also relevant - How can I prevent iPhoto from opening everytime I plug my iPad/iPhone? - which is my eventual aim.  <answer222212> I'm not sure exactly, but I can help you figure out which files changed after you plugged in the device.  Hopefully you're comfortable with Terminal.  Start a timer.  Plug in your new device, treat it like you would any other new device - trust it, let it sync, whatever.  Once that's all done, stop your timer, see how long it took and round up in minutes.  Let's assume it took 5:18.  We're going to round up to 6 minutes.  precode$ find ~ -type f -cmin -6 &gt; ~/Desktop/files_modified.txt /code/pre  Now you have a file showing all of the files that changed in the last 6 minutes.  Some of these files are going to be relevant and most aren't: when I ran this experiment I got lots of files changing related to Safari, for example.  Good luck, I hope that helps.  <answer284038> iTunesPreferencesDevices...delete any &amp; all iPhone backups listed here  <comment258618> Perhaps if you un-trust the mac from the iOS device : Settings  General  Reset  Reset Location & Privacy <comment258619> I never 'trusted' it in the first place. The iPad still asks whether to trust on subsequent connections, but the Mac 'knows' it's been seen before & not to launch Photos. <comment261794> Try grep'ing `/Library/` for your device UDID. And `~/Library`. `grep -arF 'UDID' /Library/`. You will likely find iTunes containing data but you probably want to ignore that. Mainly you are looking for a file that may contain a cache of hardware serial numbers, among other information. If it is a plist, it should be easy to edit (and not delete). <comment269260> Nice idea, thank you - my only stumbling block is I ran out of devices it has never seen before. There was only one to go at & I'd already done it before I realised I needed this question answering :( <comment269263> That's fine, create a new user on your machine and do the process there. <comment358187> The device in question never had a backup; it was not my device, not backed to my machine & has never been listed in Devices.
