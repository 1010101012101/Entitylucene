Is there a Safari extension to hide results from a Google search? <body> IMHO one of the most underrated browser extension is Chrome’s Personal Blocklist (by Google). It hides results in your Google search results after you have blocked certain domains them once. Is there a similar extension for Safari? Personal-Search-Result-Blocker, an extension hosted on GitHub, doesn’t work.   <comment157337> Well I could not find one, let us know if you do.
