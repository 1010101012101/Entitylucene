Recommend a network service monitoring application <body> I'm a network administrator for a medium-sized network. I'm looking for a fairly simple piece of software that will alert me (visually, by email, or some other mechanism) when one of the services on my network is down or otherwise unavailable. I don't need anything particularly complicated, just the ability to check if a specific TCP port is open.  In the past, I've used Mars, but this doesn't support on non-PPC Macs. JNM looks to be very similar, but it's a bit too "Java-y" and basic for me - I'd like the application to at least "bounce" the dock icon or beep or something to get my attention.  Ideally I'm looking for something like ServerSentinel, but Mac native. Again, I don't need anything fancy; I don't care about graphing, or network bandwidth, or hardware monitoring, I just want something to get my attention when a service is down, so I can fix it before the phone rings :)  Can anyone suggest software that would do the job?  <comment155319> If you are administrating a network I would not recommend to monitor it on your mac. There are servers for good reasons. Also there are a ton of network monitoring solutions out there depending on your needs. But please, if you do this on a professional level don't use a single mac in your office. Do it like a pro and setup a monitoring server. So I think this questions belongs to serverfault.com
