List of "serveradmin command" commands <body> strongtl;dr/strong: Is there a list of codeserveradmin command *:*/code commands ?  On mac servers, codeserveradmin/code can be quite useful; especially when sending commands to its services, such as codeserveradmin command smb:command = getConnectedUsers/code  Apple's outdated (but still useful) command line guide (pdf link) lists these, but a lot has changed since 10.5 ... notably, samba/afp.  Some commands which worked up until Mavericks no longer work in Yosemite and beyond.    My search for a list returns a good deal of links up until Mavericks; but, that is not so useful.    Is there anywhere which has compiled the commands for newer versions of the OS?  <comment373244> No compilation here but check `sudo serveradmin settings service  service.txt` (with service= web, afp, smb, dns, wiki etc) <comment373247> Yeah, I know about that; but (at least for smb/afp), there's not much correlation between the settings listed and what the commands can (or, past-tense, could) do.  Not holding my breath for Apple to update their server docs. <comment373310> Are you asking to generate a list from a specific version or to find Apples documentation or to find if someone else has reverse engineered the list? <comment373316> What I'm -really- after is if there's a replacement for the AFP/SMB getHistory command that shows throughput over time. But finding a list (official or reverse engineered) seemed like a more general question likely to get a hit somewhere.
