Direct download link to Maverick image <body> I've just bought a used MacBook pro. I would like to install OSX 10.9 Mavericks from scratch, erasing all previous data and settings. I don't have the passwords for the computer, so I can't access the app store and download the image directly.  Is there a direct download link to fetch the flash drive image?   <comment137824> Have you tried resetting the password using the recovery partition to gain access to the machine?  This may be easier than finding someone with a direct link to the Mavericks flash drive image.
