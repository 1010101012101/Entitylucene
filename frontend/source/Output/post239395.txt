< and ^ keys are swapped <body> I'm using a German Keyboard (Lioncast LK20) with OS X 10.11.5. I set the keymap to German and it is displayed correctly in the settings screen. Unfortunately the following two keys are swapped when I type on the keyboard:  &lt; Key (right of SHIFT)br ^ Key (left of 1)  Are there any advanced settings to fix this issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tHAgX.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KrqAP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240051> You can use Ukelele to change the keyboard layout so the meaning of those keys are swapped:  http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;id=ukelele  Note the program is called "Ukelele", not "Ukulele".  <answer240053> You can use strongKarabiner/strong to swap the keys using the following private.xml.  pre class="lang-xml prettyprint-override"code&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Swap Keys&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;private.swapkeys&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::one, KeyCode::two&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::two, KeyCode::one&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  You'll need to find the KeyCode for the keys you want to swap as I don't have a German keyboard to check. You can use EventViewer accessible from Karabiner â†’ Misc to find the KeyCodes. Replace codeone/code with one KeyCode and codetwo/code with the other KeyCode in the above private.xml.  <comment294901> This maybe utterly stupid but you could try getting a small arduino to swap the keys for you where the keyboard would go through a bare USB port connected to the arduino and thorugh out of another USB port into your computer?
