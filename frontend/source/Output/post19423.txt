Accessing events on external drive in iMovie '11 on Lion <body> I have my iMovie events stored on my external harddrive (located in a Synology NAS). It worked like a charm with iMovie '11 on Snow Leopard.  I then received my new MBP with Lion and the external drive is not showing. I cannot thus access my events which is pretty annoying as it prevents me from using the application...  strike Here is what I see in iMovie:/strike(see edit 2 for new state)br strike I previously had my external drive below the Macintosh HD one. /strike  My external drive is correctly mounted before launching iMovie:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3ypwK.png" alt="mounted HDD info"  It has the emiMovie Events/em folder at root level (and as I said, it was correctly detected under same iMovie version on Snow Leopard).  I tried mounting it using afp: but result is the same.  Any help appreciated as I don't get what could have changed between SL and Lion for this.  hr  edit: Same with volume now mounted using NFS:br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7U1hJ.png" alt="NFS Volume"  The list in iMovie stays desperately empty...  hr  edit 2: something new! My NFS mounts are now visible in the list (probably coming from an update of iMovie inbetween).br Problem is that they are still empty and with a yellow warning sign, without any tooltip on it...br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqYb6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer19426> Lion turned off an older and less secure method of authenticating AFP connections, which a lot of third-party vendors of NAS devices were using, including Synology. Synology have made available a beta release of their new firmware which fully supports Lion (as long as your Synology device was made in 2008 or later).  <answer34662> OK, I did me a nice christmas gift by solving this, and quite easily in fact.br It could be considered as workaround only but it saved my life.    Answer: strongsymlink/strong!  Now, in my emMovies/em folder, the emiMovie Events/em folder is pointing to the emiMovie Events/em folder I have on my external harddrive. All my videos are back and I can add videos without issue.    So waiting for the trick to get it work how it should, at least, I can use the application again!  <comment21332> Before posting I upgraded my NAS to the last 3.1 DSM version not seeing there were a 3.2 Beta. I'll try this one. <comment21340> Upgraded to 3.2 beta and still the same issue. When mounted (afp or smb) drive is not showing up in iMovie... :( <comment27692> Now upgraded to final 3.2 version for my NAS and still the same issue (afp, smb or nfs)
