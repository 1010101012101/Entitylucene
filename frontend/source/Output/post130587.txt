LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 - Downloaded app does not start <body> I'm trying to run an application downloaded from the internet (e.g., Jabref) but it seems that it fails silently. When I try to open it by double clicking it, nothing happens. When I use the terminal I get the following message:     LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file .../xxxx.app   I tried several suggestions that I found here like changing permissions and modifying the Info.plist file, but nothing works.  Because it's a Java application, I tried to run it through terminal using      java -cp "CLASSPATH" MAINCLASS    and it works fine.  Just to mention that I get this error not only with this app, but for a few other applications.  Thanks in advance.  <answer130692> The LSOpenURLsWithRole is a function that is used to associate a file with a program. The file you're double clicking on is not actually an application, but a data file.   This is how, for example, when double-clicking a text document, the TextEdit program or another associated app is launched.  You need to associate it with the java runtime, assuming that you have it installed.  If you right-click on the file and select Get Info, the info pane has a section called "Open With:". That should be set to the java runtime.  <answer285182> For anyone coming here who is seeing this issue for a non-Java program: I was getting the same error message when trying to run a .app file which contains a Mach-O executable. Trying to run the executable directly from within the bundle (e.g. codeFoo.app/Contents/MacOS/bar/code) gave me a much better error indicating I was missing a dynamic lib dependency:  codedyld: Library not loaded:/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib/QtWidgets.framework/Versions/5/QtWidgets/code  Something to try if you are seeing this error.
