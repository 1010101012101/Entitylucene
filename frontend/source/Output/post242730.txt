How can I post photos to my iPhone Instagram app from Google Drive? <body> I have Instagram and Google Drive both installed on my iPhone. I want to post on Instagram some photos from Google Drive. Have somebody any ideas how to do that, because in Insta library I have only photos from my iPhone camera.  <answer255992> in gdrive choose the image and in the options menu click send a copy and then open in "copy to Instagram" is a choice  <answer278706> To share a photo from your Google Drive to Instagram on your iPhone, you open the photo you want to share (by tapping on it), on the top right you'll see 3 little dots, tap the dots, and you'll get a list of options.  Choose the 'Open in' option and that will give you the option to share with Facebook etc.  if Instagram isn't there, go to the More option and enable it.  Hope that helps - took me ages to work it out!  <comment298673> I don't have Google Drive so I can't test it, but the latest version of Instagram can be added as an "Activity" under the Share menu for photos. Try going to a photo in Google Drive, tap the Share button, scroll right on the Activity icons (the colorful ones), tap More, enable Instagram if it is disabled, tap Done, then select Instagram from the Share menu. <comment298676> I understood your idea and have Share button in iCloud photos and native iPhone Photo app. But there is no Share button in Google Drive and Google photos. <comment298696> I see, that's the part I wasn't sure about. Is there a reason you don't want to save the photos to your phone then add them to Instagram? <comment298792> It was rather comfortable for me to use Google Drive for PC, laptop and Android tablet. Download edited photos to Drive and post them to Insta with a tablet. Now I think I would save photos directly to iPhone as you advise, thank you.
