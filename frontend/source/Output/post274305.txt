How to disable Better Touch Tool (BTT) inside a specific app? <body> BTT should stop triggering actions whenever I am working in a specific app and BTT should automatically start triggering actions or listening to triggers whenever I move to a different app.  Google search is not giving me any solution.  <answer274311> Click on BTT's menu bar icon, and then select strongDisable BTT for Current App/strong.  To disable specific emglobal actions/em inside a specific app, do this:  ol liOpen BTT and make an action for what you want to prevent. For example, you have a global shortcut strong⌘+F/strong which perhaps opens Alfred, but you don't want it to happen in the Finder. In that case create a new BTT gesture in the Finder and set the trigger to strong⌘+F/strong./li liThen set the action (which happens if you invoke this trigger) to simulate the shortcut strong⌘+F/strong. Essentially you are remapping the shortcut to itself, because per-app shortcuts take priority over global shortcuts./li /ol
