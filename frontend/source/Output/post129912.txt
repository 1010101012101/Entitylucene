After OD Admin is set up, email now signed with wrong certificate <body> I installed and set up OS X Mavericks server at the weekend. As part of the process, I configured Open Directory and used my "@mac.com" email address in the OD Administrator setup.  I now find that when I send email using that address from Mail.app on the server, it is signed using my own (self-authenticated) certificate created as part of setting up Server. Of course, the recipient's mail client warns them that this is from an untrusted source and that causes a lot of confusion.  Sending email using this same address from my non-server MacBook Air doesn't cause this to happen. Sending email on the server from the equivalent "@me.com" address doesn't cause this to happen either.  My knowledge of these things is thin, but it appears that setting up the OD Admin account with this email address has caused Server to modify the authentication away from the default for any mail sent from the server and using the "@mac.com" address.  My question is, regardless of what caused this, how do I change it back? I assume that there is some way to tell Mail.app which certificate to use for a given email account/address, but I don't see how. And, I'm not sure I'd know which certificate I'd tell it to use.
