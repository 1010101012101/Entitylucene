Audio Distortion After 2 Minutes of Music in Stock MBP <body> I have a MBP (13 inch early 2015, running 10.11.4) which after about 2 minutes of producing audio (Skype, Youtube from Firefox, iTunes...) via either the internal speakers or a pair of earbuds starts producing crackling distorted sound. Stopping the music and restarting also restarts the time-to-crackle.  I am unsure how long this has been happening, but there are no USB, Thunderbolt devices, or even the power charge connected as mentioned in this question.  Unlike this question this is a stock machine.  The machine has not been through any physical abuse/drops.  Is this likely to be resolvable as a software problem, or do I need to visit the Apple store for hardware help?  <answer254943> I was experiencing the same issue and was about ready to buy a new set of headphones until I plugged them into my phone and the issue went away.  I rebooted my Mac and let all the programs fully load before closing anything. That seems to have fixed the issue.  <answer256345> This has resolved without a trip to the hardware doctor. Unfortunately I don't know which OSX update caused the fix.  <comment290128> Sounds like a hardware issue, I recommend contacting apple support online.
