How do you adjust the dock bounce animation in OSX? <body> I'd like to adjust the animation for bouncing dock icons in OSX. (I'm running Yosemete 10.10.3) I've already found this article showing how to completely disable the bounce, but I want more control than simply ON/OFF. Is there a way to adjust the animation? Specifically, I want to change:  ul linumber of bounces before it stops ul liRight now, it just bounces forever, until you switch over to that application and deal with whatever it's nagging you about./li /ul/li libounce height/li libounce frequency/li libounce speed/li /ul  Can these things be changed, and if so, how?  <comment228052> I don't think that you can change these aspects of the dock behaviour. In the several years of using and tweaking my laptop with defaults.write commands I did not come across such a customisation. Can't provide hard proof though. <comment228128> I believe "number of bounces" can be controlled by the code/developer of the application that is triggering the notification, but the rest of your requested settings are not configurable. <comment344359> Very annoying feature. I wish no more bouncing in Apple OSX and replaced with notification number, and please sit there silently!
