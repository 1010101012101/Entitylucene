Does anyone have the same problem and have a workaround?  Here is the example of the icon appearing after closing iPhoto:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NwAms.gif" alt=""  <comment184092> I tested some antivirus and best of all by far, was [Avast](http://www.avast.com/en-us/index). By the way, it was also the lightest. <comment184117> If you make your question very specific we can take it off Hold. <comment184119> A useful reference on the general issue is  http://www.reedcorner.net/mmg/ <comment184129> I made the title more specific, I hope this is ok <comment184133> I've tried to make your question more specific to the problem at hand (and voted to re-open). <comment184187> I voted to get it off hold but needs more votes :( <comment184251> Not a big problem because I already removed BD and got Avast as @jherran suggested... so far so great
