Displaying calendar events as text, in the terminal <body> Using Yosemite, is there a way to display events from my calendar in the command line?  I'm aware of the stock calendars apple supplies for things like holidays and such, /usr/share/calendar/ and the command 'calendar' to display events listed in these. Is there a way to do the same thing but list events from my own calendars?  I've found that personal calendars are stored in ~/Library/Calendars but everything I've found within that folder does not work with the 'calendar' command. There are several folders with ambiguous names similar to "D4385-GS57-D352-GA248592.calendar". And some folders contain a lot of *.ics files, which I think are calendar events.  <answer162262> How about something like that:  precode$ find ~/Library/Calendars -name "*.ics" |       xargs grep -h -e "SUMMARY" -e "DTSTAMP" |       sed -E 's/^[A-Z].*:(.*$)/\1/g' |       sed -E 's/^([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})T([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2}).*$/\1-\2-\3 \4:\5:\6/g' Fist’s Birthday 2014-05-16 05:44:20 Secon’s Birthday 2014-07-26 09:58:49 Third’s Birthday 2014-05-16 05:44:20 ... /code/pre  This command will output all events in all your calendars (included subscribed ones).   <answer192982> You should look into icalbuddy http://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/ . This lets you configure what days you want to output, by date/calendar and all fields. It actually interacts great with calendars of all kinds (synced and not) and can be used in terminal, geektool, etc.  <answer211991> I like to use Homebrew to install a version of icalbuddy that works fine with OS X 10.11  precodebrew install ical-buddy  /code/pre  <comment189602> `calendar` doesn't work with *.ics files, see `man calendar` for the supported file format. But I'm curious whether there are some other means to list the content of your calendar in a readable form. <comment189608> @patrix That's right. I read through the man page when I found out about this command. I don't know too much about how the calendars work in modern OS X, but I think the *.ics files are calendar entries. What you mentioned is what I'm looking for, some other means to list the calendar contents in text form. <comment190023> This is great, I'm working through a sed beginners guide right now to learn how this works. I hope to learn enough to filter events by date. Ideally I would like to be able to pass a command that shows events for the current day and maybe five days out. <comment251490> FYI - iCalBuddy is great but there is a bug with OS X 10.11 reported here: https://github.com/ali-rantakari/icalBuddy/issues/14 <comment258020> Homebrew version can now be found at: `brew install ical-buddy`. Note the dash.
