How can I type a backtick using a German keyboard? <body> I am trying to type a backtick (code`/code) using a strongGerman keyboard/strong.  How can I do this?  <answer294308> It can be found at the top-right corner of the keyboard while holding down shift.  Type a space afterwards to exit dead key status.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nzeZQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment371517> Was TomGewecke someone that commented before and deleted it all? This is the first time I'm seeing all of this since my answer... <comment371522> Yes, your keyboard was for Windows, then haykam added an erroneous one for Mac, and after fixing it all the comments no longer made any sense so I deleted mine. <comment371608> @TomGewecke I thought you didn't want Windows. <comment371713> @TomGewecke Please stop trying to twist my words to make it look like I'm wrong. The original image was of a Windows keyboard from Wikipedia. I edited it so that it was a screenshot of the on-screen German keyboard from macOS. However, you said it was too 'erroneous' (even though I replaced a Windows keyboard, which you didn't want) and replaced it again with a diagram of the German macOS keyboard. <comment371755> @haykam For correct keyboard diagrams, you must use https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794  and not screenshots on your machine. <comment371760> @user3439894 Thanks for adding the correct image.
