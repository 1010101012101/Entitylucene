Paste into mail and keep format of pasted text but don't change to that format thereafter <body> This annoyance occurs every time I paste something into an email I am editing in OS X Mail. Here is what happens every time:  ol liI am composing my email in the default format./li liI paste something in, which is in a different format, that I want to preserve. This occurs automatically, and is not a problem at this point./li liThe annoyance occurs when I resume typing after the pasting, and the format has now changed to that of the pasted text and I need to reset it./li /ol  I am hoping there is some simple solution to this annoyance which occurs for me many dozens of times per day.  <answer199489> This is what I do:  ul liWrite the first paragraph./li liWrite part of the the second paragraph./li liGo back to the end of the first paragraph and press kbdreturn/kbd or kbdenter/kbd a couple of times./li liPaste whatever will change the text style into the space you've just created./li /ul  Not very elegant but it does the job.  <comment240386> Thats what I do for a workaround. But not elegant as you say. Thanks.
