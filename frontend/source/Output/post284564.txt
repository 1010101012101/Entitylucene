Why do contents of tags folder disappear from sidebar in Open File dialogs? <body> I use a number of tags on the sidebar to access frequently used folders (i.e. "projects", "people").   At least since El Capitan and on Sierra, I have a problem with Open file dialogs in some applications: If I click on an Tag on the dialogue sidebar, the contents (usually folders) would flash briefly and then disappear. Clicking again makes the contents flash visible briefly again, before dissapearing.  Affected applications include MS Office and Apple's iWork apps. Others like the open dialog in Sublime Text or Skim works as expected.   This problem survived the upgrade to sierra from El Capitan. Any ideas?
