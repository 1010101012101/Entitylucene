Is there a Mac keyboard shortcut to "Select Current Line"? <body> I am looking for a keyboard shortcut that selects the full line (i.e., the text of the line) of the blinking caret cursor in any editable, multi-line text field. Nothing more than just this one line should be selected.  hr  I understand that one can use the following two keyboard shortcuts in succession to accomplish this:  kbdshift/kbd + kbd⬆/kbd   kbdshift/kbd + kbd➡/kbd  However, this does not work in all applications. That is, sometimes this combo highlights the current line emplus/em the previous line, minus the first character of the previous line.  <answer285127> To move the cursor to the start/end of the line, you can use ⌘← and ⌘→.  To select whilst moving the cursor, add ⇧. You need to move the cursor to one end of the line first using strong⌘← or ⌘→, then hold ⇧ and use the opposite ⌘→ or ⌘←/strong.  <answer285129> To select an entire line of editable text, assuming a left justified language...  If the insertion point cursor is at the beginning of the line, press:  ul liCommand–Shift–Right Arrow   ⌘⇧➡/li /ul  If the insertion point cursor is at the end of the line, press:  ul liCommand–Shift–Left Arrow    ⌘⇧⬅/li /ul  If the insertion point cursor is at any other part of the line, press:  ul liCommand–Left Arrow, Command–Shift–Right Arrow   ⌘⬅ ⌘⇧➡  Note that in this previous key sequence set, that you can keep the ⌘ key pressed while pressing/releasing ⬅ then press ⇧➡ so as to eliminate pressing/releasing the ⌘ key twice./li /ul  See the Document shortcuts section in Mac keyboard shortcuts.  <comment359534> Command–Left Arrow, Command–Shift–Right Arrow <comment359535> Great. Do you want to post that as an answer?
