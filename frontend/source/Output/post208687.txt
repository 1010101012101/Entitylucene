Sudden strange keyboard behaviour Mac OS X <body> Suddenly my keyboard is behaving weirdly. Here's some examples of what happening:  ul liLeft command not working at all/li liLeft option + L moves the cursor down one line/li liLeft control + L moves cursor down one line/li liLeft X working sporadically /li liLeft X working sporadically/li liOption + T does what Option + Control + T should do/li liControl + T does what Option + Control + T should do/li /ul  So the problem seems to be concentrated around the bottom left area of the keyboard.  Just before this started happening, I cleaned my keyboard with a damp cloth and also repaired computer's disk using Disk Utility. So I assume one of these things is responsible for issues.  Can anyone suggest a fix?  <comment251701> try another keyboard.  if it works ok, then most likely the original one is damaged. <comment251712> is it your built-in keyboard that's the problem? Definitely not the disk repair, very likely water damage. Plenty of suggestions/tales of woe if you google `macbook keyboard water damage`. <comment251713> I don't know if you wrote _"Left X working sporadically"_ by mistake or it's part of your keyboards strange behaviour. :P Does this also happen when you try it in a new user account? <comment251715> @user14492 did you also notice it was there twice? :) <comment251816> @CupawnTae Right, that's what I was trying to write, I guess my keyboard is broken too. :P <comment251861> @user14492 oh, I assumed you meant the other aspect - what's a "left X"? Is there a "right X"? :-) <comment251952> Took it to Apple store, it's water damaged. I've split coffee on it before and it's been fine. Not sure why a damp cloth has caused water damage.
