iOS 8, iPhone 6 Plus :: Safari :: there was a problem communicating with the secure web proxy server (HTTPS) <body> I am getting error "there was a problem communicating with the secure web proxy server (HTTPS)".  i have to use the proxy server setup to test my web application which is under development. It is kind of a gateway to the web servers. I agree that there is certificate error while accessing proxy over https. there is no alternate to the proxy server setup.  My question is: How do we add exception to this error on iPhone 6 with iOS 8 ? While checking on iPhone 5::iOS 7, safari did inform me about the certificate error and asked if an exception should be added. I said 'Yes' and the page opened successfully thereon. Even for iPad Air 16GB::iOS 9, i was asked to add an exception.  Why is safari on iOS 8 not asking for this exception? Anything in specific to iOS8 because iOS 7 and iOS 9 work good.  there are multiple solution given on stackexchange viz. 1. deleting the profiles 2. reset network settings 3. reset phone  Is there any setting which i need to enable so that i can override certificate errors?  Any help here is greatly appreciated.  Many thanks.  i tried all 3, but no success.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MRZD5.png" alt="The error when i try to browse a page over proxy serever"  <comment259053> Why haven't you upgraded to iOS 9? Is there any particular reason you want to stay with an outdated OS? <comment259358> Well, yes, i have to be on iOS8. as i said it is a test device where i check how my web pages render on iOS8 <comment259697> Ping ... any help here is greatly appreciated
