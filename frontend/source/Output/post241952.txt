Hard drive full with 200GB of used space that I can't find <body> All of a sudden I've run out of space. On my strong250GB/strong hard drive, strong236GB/strong is used up with only strong13GB/strong free.   I used Finder to find big files. Nothing significant.   I used tools like Disk Inventory X, OmniDiskSweeper and Purple Tree, but according to them I've only used up strong40GB/strong.   So somehow strong200GB/strong is used up, but I can't see where.  Time Machine isn't running (and never has). The disk has no partitions.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0xXaW.png" alt="Screenshot of Disk Utility"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8NuzI.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Disk Inventory X"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UHJBx.png" alt="Screenshot of OmniSweeper"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UpYm3.png" alt="Screenshot of Purple Tree"  <answer242156> I scanned my drive with DaisyDisk, and as an administrator. (Instructions) I found strong187GB/strong in the hidden "strong.DocumentsRevisons-V100/strong" folder. These are document versions which the OS autosaves (more info). It appears to be from documents primarily from the app Sketch.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zbbdb.png" alt="Screenshot of DaisyDisk scan"  Here's how I removed the files.   ul liOpen Terminal/li liPaste codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES/code (This makes all hidden files visible)/li liRelaunch Finder. You can hold down "Option" and then right click Finder. Click Relaunch. /li liLook within the folder strongMacintosh HD/.DocumentRevisions-V100//strong (For me there were a number of underlining folders with lots of files within.) /li liDelete the folders and files within./li liEmpty the Trash/li liIn Terminal paste codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO/code . This makes hidden files hidden again. /li liRelaunch Finder again. Click the System Apple top left, then "About this Mac" and then "Storage."

I just tried DaisyDisk. When I scanned as an admin, I found **187GB** in the hidden ".DocumentsRevisons-V100" folder. It's the Autosave version that it seems OS X has started doing.   Why did this happen? What's the best way to deal with it? It looks like some people just delete these files, but how do I prevent it in the future?
