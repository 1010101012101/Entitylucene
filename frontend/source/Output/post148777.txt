To exclude bak files in Finder's search? <body> I create bak files after every Perl operation.  How can you exclude all bak files in your Finder's search?  <answer148849> The answer to this question is to add strong.noindex/strong -extension at the end of .bak. Thank you, Tetsujin! I refer this one liner to do it  precodefind . -name "*\.tex" -exec bash -c 'mv "{}" "{}.noindex"' \; /code/pre  <comment175229> can you persuade it to save the bak files as file.bak.noindex ? If so, that will prevent Spotlight indexing them <comment175230> You could retrospectively add .noindex using this applescript - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/148766/applescript-to-automatically-add-noindex-extension-to-a-file - or even set up Automator to do it. <comment175238> I didn't know my script would spread this fast :).
