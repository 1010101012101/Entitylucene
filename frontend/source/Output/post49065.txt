How to tune the iTunes and App Store to remember the password for a very long time? <body> By default iTunes and App Store are remembering your password only for 15 minutes and this is really annoying for someone that keeps the access to his computer safe anyway.  I am almost sure that these could me change by tuning a plist files from the command line. What is the secret command to make it code-1/code instead of code15/code? ;)  <answer49070> Enabling automatic downloads can help, but it's highly unlikely that this is simply a preference on the client. I would presume (but haven't reverse engineered) that the server is signaling the purchases that require a password either by signing a certificate with a short expiration time or upon each "purchase."   <comment56160> Possible. But without more inside information, I would presume the simpler implementation of the client just remembering (and forgetting) the password. Wasn't this something that recently changed *via an iOS (i.e. client-side) update*.
