Battery indicator is stuck on one number <body> I have an iPhone 4s and the battery indicator is stuck on one number no matter how long I charge it.  If I turn the phone off and then try to put it it on again it won't happen it will say the phone needs charging, even if it has been on the charger for an hour.  <comment148515> Hold powerbutton and homebutton till you see the Apple icon and the device will do a hardware reset <comment148531> Is the phone actually charging? When you plug the cable into a low-power usb port sometimes the phone simply doesn't charge.
