How to bring an application made in Automator to the foreground upon launch? <body> I've created an application with AppleScript in Automator.  I've created a Service in Automator which launches the aforementioned app.  The Service is triggered by a keyboard shortcut.  The problem is that upon launch, the application's dialog box has a light gray top bar. I have to click anywhere on the dialog for the dialog to turn to the darker gray, which shows that the app is now selected.  Is it possible for my application to do this automatically?  <answer261609> Have a look at the codeactivate/code emcommand/em in the AppleScript Language Guide Commands Reference.     activate  Brings an application to the front, and opens it if it is on the local computer and not already running.   I'd add codeactivate me/code after the start of the codeon run/code emhandler/em.  <comment327587> Do you have an `activate` _command_ after the start of the `on run` _handler_? (In the app, not the service.) <comment327588> No, there is no `activate` _command_ in the entire app. Also, the issue occurs with every one of my Services and it occurs even if I run the Service manually (via the "Services" menu in the top left corner of the screen). <comment327632> `activate me` solves the problem. I wonder why this is not the default behavior of AppleScript applications.
