Multiple color Labels in the Finder toolbar <body> In my finder toolbar, I have the color label drop-down. I would like to have multiple instances of it with different colors pre-selected. However it isn't possible to even add more than one instance of 'label' to the toolbar, so basically what I'm asking is:  ul liIs there a 'hacky' way to add it anyway, and if so, can it have different colors pre-selected?/li liIf above isn't possible, does anyone know of a software that will achieve this? I have not found one yet./li /ul  <comment111187> I have not been able to find anything to add more color labels as well. Have you found a way to do this? Thank you. <comment112161> Nope, haven't found a thing. As far as I can tell, it isn't possible.
