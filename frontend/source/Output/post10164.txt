Unable to install from downloaded disk image file <body> My Mac G4 (running OS X 10.3.9) won't install from any .dmg file I download. It keeps popping up a message: "name of setup &amp; no mountable file system" or "application file cannot be found". Is there some setting I need to change to get around this problem as I need to install some extra programs urgently.  <answer10174> I think a lot of the DMGs that you find on the internets today are compressed, which older disk utilities may not support. You might be SOL here  =\ (unless you upgrade or has another computer with a newer OS)  <answer10182> It is likely the disk images do not support Mac OS X 10.3.9.  The command line tool used to create disk images is called hdiutil. This hdiutil manual page documents the DMG format's history and compatibility with older editions of Mac OS X.  hdiutil manual page  <comment10550> Poorly worded question. Need more info.
