Trackpad on Late 2016 MBP Stops Working When USB Gamepad Is Attached or ControllerMate Is Running <body> I have been user ControllerMate to optimize my workflow when using an external keyboard to trigger macros with Keyboard Maestro.  This worked very well until recently, when I installed an update for ControllerMate.  Now, when ControllerMate is running, the built-in trackpad of my MacBook Pro (late 2016) stops working. When I quit the application, the trackpad is functional again.  I thought it was an issue with ControllerMate, so I posted on their support forum, so far without any useful feedback.  Then I noticed that the same thing – non-functional trackpad – happens when I attach a gamepad controller via USB (GameSir G3).  strongCan somebody give me advice how to troubleshoot and perhaps find a fix for this problem?/strong  <answer288562> strongFixed/strong  The problem was that apparently installing the new version of ControllerMate somehow checked the preference “System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse &amp; Trackpad  Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present”. I turned it off again and everything works fine now.   Thanks @toma for pointing it out in the comments!  <comment364328> Did you check the setting in System Preferences  Accessibility  Mouse & Trackpad  Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present?
