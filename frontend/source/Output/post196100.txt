Why is iCloud Music Library silently deactivating itself? <body> The most relevant post is this one: iCloud Music Library can&#39;t be enabled However in my case, I don't get any error back, it simply disables iCloud Library by itself, seconds after I enable it and click either "merge" or "replace". The same thing happening on my iPhone and Mac (iTunes), it throws no error but it doesn't do anything either.  Has anyone else encountered this?  PS: Regardless of the number of attempts, it still won't turn on. I also bought more iCloud space, same issue.
