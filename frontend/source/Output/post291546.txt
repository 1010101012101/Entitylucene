Can two apps in one iPhone can be connected to same peripheral? <body> I have to connect two apps to Bluetooth band (peripheral) at the same time and in same device. Please Guide.  <answer291550> The Bluetooth connection is established between the phone and the device - the device does not exclusively connect to an individual application.   To answer the question a Bluetooth device can be used with multiple apps that are designed to work with it. For example, a Bluetooth speaker works with the Music app, it also works with YouTube etc.   Your device may have limitations that I am not aware of but without more information I can only tell you know Bluetooth works
