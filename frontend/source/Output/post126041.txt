Get iTerm session by tty name <body> I want to run a command within an iTerm2 session like this:  precodetell application "iTerm"   tell session id "/dev/ttys020"     exec command "ls"   end end /code/pre  But I get the following error (with and without '/dev' in the tty name)  precode227:255: execution error: iTerm got an error: Canâ€™t get session id "/dev/ttys020". (-1728) /code/pre  The name is the one given by the codetty/code. I also run this script to make sure that I am using the right id:  precode  tell application "iTerm"     tell the current terminal         tell the current session             display dialog (get id)         end     end   end  /code/pre  Actually, I am not sure if the command must be sent to a strongsession/strong or to a strongterminal/strong, but I cannot manage to find a tty and send a command to it.
