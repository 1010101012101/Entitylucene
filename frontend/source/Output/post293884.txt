Having trouble changing user's local account picture from command line <body> I want to be able to change a user's local account picture from the command line.  I've tried this:   precodedscl . -delete /Users/Admin Picture dscl . -delete /Users/Admin JPEGPhoto dscl . -create /Users/Admin Picture /Baseball.jpg /code/pre  The above works to set the user's "Picture" attribute to "/Baseball.jpg" with the following result:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VkBFA.png" alt="Example"  As shown in the picture, Admin's 'icon' to the left is now a baseball, but the main profile picture- the one that appears at the user login screen- is blank.  That's the picture I'm trying to change.  It looks like I can accomplish this by editing the "JPEGPhoto" attribute. However, "JPEGPhoto" stores JPEG images as text, which looks like this:  precodeffd8ffe0 00104a46 49460001 01000048 00480000 ffe1004c 45786966 00004d4d 002a0000 /code/pre  Except a whole lot longer.  I converted "Baseball.jpg" to that and now have a 1.6 MB text file "Baseball.txt"  So I try this:  precodedscl . -create /Users/Admin JPEGPhoto `cat Baseball.txt` /code/pre  But since the file is so big, I get   precode-bash: /usr/bin/sudo: Argument list too long /code/pre  So I tried this:  precodefor i in `cat Baseball.txt`; do dscl . -append /Users/Admin JPEGPhoto $i; done /code/pre  That appends each word in the file to JPEGPhoto, one at a time.  It works, but takes over an hour to finish... too long.  I tried using the 'split' utility to split Baseball.txt into smaller files- but 'split' works using lines or bytes. The file is all one line, and splitting by bytes splits words in the middle.  Any ideas?  Alternatively, does anyone know where the actual dscl attributes are stored so I can just edit the files directly?
