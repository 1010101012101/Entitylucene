How do I circumvent the versioning system to run an outdated MacOSX application? <body> I have iMovie HD 6.03. I want it to run on Yosemite. The application icon itself has a "circle-slash-do-not-run" icon superimposed on the iMovie icon. When I double click the icon a dialog pops up saying that it can't run.  I can dig into the application package itself and run the actual compiled executable; this tells me that the application itself can run but something in the packaging is preventing iMovie from running.  strongHow do I tweak the application packaging so that iMovie 6.0.3 can run on Yosemite?/strong I expect to edit a plist or something.  <answer193161> This should do the trick :   In Finder :   ul liRight click on the App = View Package Contents/li liOpen codeContents/MacOS/iMovie HD/code/li /ul  <comment230096> +1. I had to do something similar for iPhoto recently, and ended up creating an Automator action that ran the equivalent iPhoto command as a bash script, which I now keep on my dock where iPhoto used to be. <comment230557> In my description I noted that I'm already doing this. Quote: 'I can dig into the application package itself...' I'm looking for a way to circumvent the versioning system. @scottishwildcat has a better suggestion...
