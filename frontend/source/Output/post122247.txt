Taking a screenshot of a tooltip <body> I am attempting to take a screenshot of a tooltip that appears when a user hovers over it, and immediately disappears upon any key press or cursor movement.  Unfortunately, this means the typical shortcut I use for screenshots (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbd4/kbd) causes the element to disappear.  Is there any way I can capture this tooltip, preferably without installing any third party software?  <answer122248> kbd⌘/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd3/kbd should do the trick, it captures the entire screen.  The only downsides are that it doesn't grab the cursor as well and depending on what you want you may have to crop it a bit in Preview afterwards.  That's how I grabbed this image.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HOmic.png" alt="Screenshot showing active tooltip"  <answer122252> You can do this with the Capture  Timed Screen option in the Grab utility. After starting the timer, you'll have 10 seconds to get back to what you want a shot of (including getting the tooltip to reappear).  Also, you can use the Grab application's preferences to control whether (&amp; how) the mouse pointer appears in the shot. What it doesn't let you do is choose which region to take a shot of, it just grabs the entire screen; you'll have to crop it appropriately yourself.  <answer122254> You can do this using the screencapture CLI:  precodescreencapture -T 5 -C ~/Desktop/screencapture.png /code/pre  supDefine a delay using code-T &lt;seconds&gt;/code. Use code-C/code to capture the cursor too./sup  Add code-i/code to capture interactively. This uses the normal capture region selection available from ⌘⇧4, however you can combine this with code-T/code to add a delay so that it captures the tooltip in the region.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fXlA.gif" alt=""  <answer122293> If you only want the tooltip in the screenshot (without capturing anything else in the background), a faster way would be to use the keyboard shortcut kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbd4/kbd, then position the crosshair over the tooltip, then press kbdspace/kbd (the crosshair should now turn into a camera). Then simply click on the tooltip, and you’ll get a nice screenshot of it with a transparent background and even its shadow to boot!  An example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQVfJ.png" alt="tooltip_HiDPI"  <answer123119> Weird. I had no trouble with (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd+kbd4/kbd) in Safari (7.0.2).  This was taken from this site.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AY0m6.png" alt="screen capture"  <answer145267> I was having the same issue &amp; discovered that the 'disappearing' screen shots were being saved to Dropbox.   Can't remember setting up that save-to destination... But worth a look if the answers above don't help. Only a problem on my MacBook Air running 10.9.4  <answer229535> The trick is simple, you have to keep press (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdSHIFT/kbd) first. Then hover mouse to make tool tip appear and press (kbd4/kbd).  <answer255983> strongSimple way to do this : a small trick/strong   precode 1. just open you screen , for which you want to take screen shot   2. point to tool-tip , it will show that tooltip .  3  then capture whole screen by Command+Shift+3  4. preview above captured image , and expand to full screen   5. now use Command+Shift+4 to capture tool-tip /code/pre  <comment142638> Thanks, seems like it would be a good solution, however, as soon as I hit ⌘, the tooltip disappears from the screen.  This is the case for Stackexchange as well.  Maybe it's my browser?  edit: Tried the same thing in Chrome, and the tooltip remains.  Thanks! <comment142640> Ah cool, didn't realize the tooltip behavior could be dictated by the browser.  I almost always use Safari so I hadn't noticed it before. <comment142643> Thanks, I didn't know about Grab.  Seems like a great solution to keep the cursor in the picture. <comment143757> I discovered earlier that this is actually browser specific behavior.  See my first comment on the accepted answer. <comment157494> Oh wow, I've needed to know this forever <comment301219> Some great answers here, but for my use case, this turned out to be the simple trick I needed ! <comment305607> This was the simplest. Perfect. <comment346017> This is really nice, but only seems to work in Safari for me - not in Chrome. <comment359101> Tried a couple of solutions which worked great. But this is the simplest. <comment361082> Doesn't seem to work for external screens
