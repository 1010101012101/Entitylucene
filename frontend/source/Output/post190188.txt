Mirror parts of screen to external monitor <body> I'd like to mirror/clone separate parts of my iMac screen to smaller external displays.   For me the best solution would be to draw a frame on top of the iMac display and let that special frame show up on a smaller external display.  Is this possible? How can I do this?  <answer191974> There are tools for doing this which are visual aids like zooming and following the mouse around, maybe they might work?  <comment225703> would screen sharing work for that? <comment225754> I've never seen anything that can do this. You can ADD a screen to the Mac but I am unsure if this is even possible. However wiser people than me may know of something...
