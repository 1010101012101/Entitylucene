Garageband—how to change volume of a region (not whole track)? <body> In garageband I have one audio track with many regions. I'd like to adjust the volume for each region. Is there an easy way to do that, or do I have to make a new track each time, and adjust the tracks volume?  <answer283839> Finally found the answer, not very intuitive but cool once you know.  There's a button to toggle 'automation'. Once that's on you can select from a dropdown whether you want to change volume, echo, reverb, etc. Then you click on the actual waves on the track and a coloured line will appear. Clicking along the line creates break points, and you can move either points or the line segments between points to shift the volume. It's not based on regions—you can adjust it anywhere.

Now you do.
