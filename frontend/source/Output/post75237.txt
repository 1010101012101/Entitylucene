Renew for OpenAFS does not work <body> I use OSX 10.8.2 and OpenAFS 1.6.1a. Even I have checked "Enable auto-renew", the ticket allways expires. My settings:  ul liSeconds before expire to renew: 4000/li liTicket renewal check frequency: 3600/li /ul  In my understanding, with that setting AFS should always a renew strongbefore/strong expiring. Do I miss something or is there a bug in OpenAFS?  PS: The tag does not fit very well, but no AFS or OpenAFS tag exists.
