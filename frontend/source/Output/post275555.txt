Deleting photos in Recycle folder <body> If I delete all photos in the recycle folder, will those photos delete from camera roll or any other folder it may be in?   <comment346655> Photos in the Recently Deleted are not shown in Camera Roll and other folders. <comment346672> Welcome to Ask Different. Unfortunately, your question lacks enough detail for anyone here to answer definitively. At present, it's not clear what _recycle folder_ you're talking about? Is this within a particular app? Within a particular OS (e.g. macOS Sierra, iOS 10, etc)?
