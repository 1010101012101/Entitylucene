Looking for advice setting up a new Mac Mini with Lion Server <body> I am setting up a new Mac Mini server which will serve as a web server (with Apache and MySQL) as well as some other pieces of functionality.  I have seen little on securing OS X for such a scenario (I am running Lion - and this is not Lion Sever).    I assume it is recommended to use ipfw as opposed to the application firewall.  I also assume that it makes sense to lock down SSH (put it on a non-standard port and use certificate authentication).  However, should I also lock down screen sharing (and force an SSH tunnel for this)?  Any tips on this are welcome.  <answer23041> Although written for 10.5, this guide by Daniel Cuthbert (PDF) is fairly comprehensive and largely still applies to Lion.  Closing off screen sharing and tunneling it (if you need it at all) through SSH is probably a good idea.  Standard rules apply:  ul liOnly open absolutely necessary ports to the outside world/li liKeep your software up to date/li liDisable any unused services &amp; Apache modules/li liDisable any listeners you don't need, rebind those you do need to localhost only if they're not needed outside (codelsof -i/code is your friend)/li liCheck that your firewall is really working as expected (codenmap/code from an outside host)/li /ul  Mac specific things:  ul liMake sure the console is password protected, locks if you're using screensharing and doesn't auto-login on startup/li liYou may want to enable verbose boot messages by default, it'll make debugging easier in case things go bad: codesudo nvram boot-args="-v"/code/li /ul  <comment25703> Don't use LDAP for user authentication until it actually checks more than whether any text is entered in the user field.
