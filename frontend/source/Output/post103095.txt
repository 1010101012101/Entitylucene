How can I troubleshoot an iTunes install problem? <body> I'm having a hard time trying to install iTunes on my Windows 7.  After reading some sites like this, this or this, I can`t go further then trying to install, and failing after few seconds, without any meaningful error message.  In some blog I have even found the the command-line switch     iTunes64Setup.exe /l*v c:\log.txt    to generate a log, but it doesn't give me any useful information. And since my wife is getting bored with her iThings that can't be connected to the iTunes, I ask you...  ... where can I find more troubleshoot information? Is there some e-mail at Apple that would analyze my .log and help me ?  emEdit:/em  ul lithere is no Apple folder in Program Files or Program Files (x86)/li lithere is no Apple software installed in the computer/li /ul  emEdit 2:/em  The end of the log says:     Property(C): INSTALL_ASUW = 1      Property(C): INSTALL_BONJOUR = 1      === Log parado: 25/09/2013  21:26:57 ===      MSI (c) (6C:F8) [21:26:57:117]: Note: 1: 1708       MSI (c) (6C:F8) [21:26:57:117]: Transforming table Error.

Was the admin user of the Windows 7 that was corrupted, somehow. Created a new one and everything works.  This way this question got a kind of off-topic, so I'll flag it to be deleted in few days.  <comment121361> What is the message you get ? or the log ? maybe we can see something in it to help you. <comment124559> It's a question about using Apple software. It's on-topic here.
