iPad 2 develops "ghost touch" after replacing glass panel <body> I have a 16 GB iPad 2 GSM which I accidentally dropped on the floor face-down and the glass panel developed huge cracks. In India, Apple does not replace any part of the iDevices, and doing this voids the Indian warranty. So I got my glass panel/digitizer replaced from a cellphone repair shop, and it worked nicely for some months.   When it came back from the shop, there is a very small yellowish aura that can be seen on one particular spot of the screen, and I hope that it is not a serious issue. (It has decreased since then-now barely visible.)  But my iPad has developed a "ghost touch"-it's interpreting a touch when nobody-or nothing-is even touching the screen. It is happening near the centre of the screen. So, even without my interference, my iPad is launching apps, typing gibberish into the keyboard or making Timberman chop wood continuously on the left side and die.  What should I do? Apple does not repair any iDevice in India, and since I don't live in a metropolis, these cellphone repair shops are my only way to get it fixed.  <comment168978> Hello? Anybody out there?
