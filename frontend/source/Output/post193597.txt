Latest version of Firefox Portable for Mac <body> I would like to know what is the latest version of Firefox Portable for Mac. I just found versions from 2011-2013 and they seem pretty old. By the way, these softwares are not from the official developer (Mozilla).  <answer193622> I do not know what Firefox Portable for Mac is, but I am running a current version of Firefox on my Macs, you can get it from here: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=sem2015Q2&amp;utm_term=fast+web+browser&amp;utm_content=speed1  Firefox discusses portable here https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/973932  <answer193718> Like you said there are no up-to-date Portable Firefox for OSX at the moment.   In order to have this to work, it would require to modify the source code to modifiy the directory where Firefox store it's tmp/config files.   <comment230960> Hey, thanks for your answer, but I need this program for Mac: http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable <comment230990> Thanks @Matthieu Riegler - In that case, how can I install two versions of normal Firefox in my Mac? <comment231042> Did you connect there with your Mac? When I do it presents me with a Mac version. In fact I downloaded Firefox 38.0.5.dmg from there a few minutes ago before I replied to you. <comment231115> Yes, it can be downloaded for Mac, but I need a portable version, not the normal Firefox. <comment231278> Sorry Alex,  good luck :)
