How do I transfer my iOS developer profile to another computer? <body> I got a new MBP and would like to transfer my certificates and profiles from my old computer.  According to TN 2250, under "Transferring Your Identities," I need to transfer three sets of items:  ul liall iPhone Developer certificates in your keychain/li liall iPhone Distribution certificates in your keychain/li liall Provisioning Profiles in the Xcode Organizer  Devices tab  Provisioning Profiles section under "Library"/li /ul  TN 2250 suggests I click a link entitled "Transfer Your Developer Profile to Another Computer" to find out how to do said transfer, but that link effectively gives a 404 and refreshes to a page called "About Xcode"  How do I transfer my developer profile to another computer?  My old machine is running OS X 10.6.8 and Xcode 4.2 (4C199).br The new machine is running OS X 10.7.4 and Xcode 4.3.3 (4E3002).  <answer57060> You need to export your private key from Key Chain access of Mac OSX in which certificates are running successfully or from which developer certificate made and download certificates from Apple Developer Portal, it will work as it works for me.  <answer57064> You can do this from within Xcode.  From the Organiser, on the devices tab, you can export your developer profile to a file which you can then import into Xcode on another computer.  The step by step process is explained in http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/080-Manage_Your_Devices/manage_devices.html near the bottom in the section entitled strongTransfer Your Developer Profile to Another Computer/strong  Note that if you don't have a Teams section in your Organizer - Devices, you can just drag and drop the password-protected Developer profiles export-file, onto the Xcode icon in the toolbar. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qigyy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104221> Import/Export works differently in Xcode 5+. This Apple Developer guide shows you how to do it.  Your account is shown under strongXcode/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongAccounts/strong, and can be exported by clicking the gear icon (img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rockU.png" width="10") in the lower-left.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wKI1O.png" alt="Exporting Your Developer Profile"  <comment65525> And in the "About XCode" user guide you'll find this page (last section): http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/080-Manage_Your_Devices/manage_devices.html <comment65529> ah wait; I don't have a "Teams" section in Organizer - Devices. <comment65530> Do you have a profiles section? with Import Export buttons along the bottom. <comment65531> Xcode 4 makes the process a lot easier, allowing you to wrap up your dev profile along with your public and private keys and import them into Xcode on another machine without having to go to the KeyChain and pull them out one by one. <comment65532> Ah! "Developer profile" under library!  thanks! <comment65538> Ah, this is traditional method which I am doing since I started development. You may right Xcode 4 providing those process which I learned today. <comment65539> I'm one step closer, but now getting a different error; thanks for your help! <comment65585> thank you for pointing that out; I hadn't seen it (obviously).  :-) <comment247416> The **step by step** link no longer exists now. <comment257770> Will this work If both computers are logged in with the [same] developer account? <comment319696> Somebody any idea? I want to work on my iOS project from my mac-mini AND macbook with the same account. does this work?
