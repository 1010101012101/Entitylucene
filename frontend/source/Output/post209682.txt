El Capitan incompatible with Mad Catz Editor <body> I upgraded my Macbook Pro to OSX 10.11 El Capitan but sadly the mapping software for my Mad Catz Mouse (M.M.O.7) does not start anymore.

Does anyone have a workaround ?   I contacted the Mad Catz team via Facebook and Twitter 2 days ago and I still have no answer.  <answer209698> Because of the new security implemented in El Capitan (see here), and if Mad Katz installs stuff in protected directories (such as code/usr/bin/code), chances are the upgrade hosed the mouse.  Look in   code/Library/SystemMigration/History/Migration-something-about-your-computer/QuarantineRoot/code  and see if there is anything about the mouse.  This is likely, especially if the mouse required a kernel extension to actually function.  In this case you have to wait until Mad Katz release a compatible upgrade... or you might want to disable the extra protection and reinstate the kernel extension.  <answer211396> I'm having the same issue, in a chat with Madcatz support they stated to come up with a new driver by end of this year - still a bit to suffer unfortunately.  Installing USB overdrive and controller mate are too much for me to achieve a little bump in functionality.   <answer211956> You asked for a workaround and I am giving you a WORKING workaround  ol liUninstall Mad Catz Editor/li liInstall USB Drive (I am not sure if this step is optional)/li liDisable everything in USB Drive/li liClick on Status, see Mad Catz R.A.T.9 Wireless Mouse in the list of currently handled by the USB Overdrive window/li liLaunch Controller Mate. See how you can know remap the wheel (favorite thing about the mouse!) to anything you want./li /ol  I have the wheel remapped to zoom in/out, and the side buttons to Volume Up/Down  <comment252943> Please put all info on this site and not pastebin <comment252960> @Mark : I would love to but output is too large. Why does it bother you that it is on pastebin? <comment253173> The referenced content on pastern.com might disappear, also it forces people to go through an extra hop just to understand the problem. That's why it is preferable to have questions/answers stand on their own. <comment255930> What is "UBS Drive" which needs to be installed in step 2? And I don't think the step can be optional if you proceed to disable everything in it in the next step <comment255998> sorry can't comment but it's re above workaround. Firstly it's called USB Overdrive and is a paid software, the instruction is confusing when the installation is optional ;) Controller mate is again another 3rd party software which I'm not familiar with. I gave Overdrive a try but didn't work for me as the status doesn't show the RAT 7 (but my apple keyboard). I have currently uninstalled madcatz editor and navigate dashboard and mission control with keyboard and shortcuts. The only thing which is not properly working is mouse hover over links. I rather wait for madcatz then messing up the sys <comment256903> I'm sorry @XavierHaniquaut I cannot answer because of my reputation but I had the same and I was able to solve it, deleting the folder ~/Library/Application\ Support/Smart\ Technology. Open your terminal and digit `sudo rm -R ~/Library/Application\ Support/Smart\ Technology` then open the editor again <comment256947> @Serluca : Thanks that is a bit nicer, I managed to reopen the editor, but its not really stable. And I lost my previous config. I edited my post to show your answer. <comment256948> @XavierHaniquaut I contacted them as well, seems that they are working on a new version <comment256954> Please do not edit the question to include (partial) answers. <comment256955> @serluca Can you post this as an answer please? There is no reputation requirement regarding answers, so unless you are blocked from answering in general answering should be possible. <comment256957> @patrix 10 points required to answer this question, this is my first day and I'm not allowed to do it. Sorry <comment256963> @serluca you have 101 reputation <comment257082> @patrix I know, but is not my fault, look http://cl.ly/image/322w3b3p462T nothing that I can do... <comment271142> Contacted them before Christmas and they said (quoting literally): "Please, be informed that we are working on a new software version that is 10.11 version. Still nothing.   He hope to release it in the first part of 2016." <comment276058> As of 2/10/16 they are still working on it but no date has been given for its completion. <comment291779> I think he would like to say "USB Overdrive", a device driver (+ software) which handles USB controlers (mouse, keyboard, etc.)
