"Could not verify InAppPurchase with AppStore" after successful purchase by Beta Tester <body> I have developed an App on Xamarin and I have published it to TestFlight with configuration set to "Appstore | iPhone". As an internal tester I am testing the app and during a purchase scenario when I click Buy, it says "Your purchase was successful", but when I click OK, an error is thrown [file attached] saying "Could not verify InAppPurchase with the AppStore. (CIAP002)".   ul liIs it because, the account is of a beta tester?  /li liOr is it because of the build configuration "App Store | iPhone", that I have selected? /li liOr something else? Please help, thanks in advance. /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qILpp.png" alt="Here is the screenshot of the error"
