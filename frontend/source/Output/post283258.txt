Backed up files seem to be same regardless of date <body> Trying to restore a file from TM I found that files as they appeared on even the oldest backup that TM had to offer me, were the same as files on my hard drive as they were changed or created just yesterday. How is that possible?  Certainly seems to be contrary to the whole purpose of backing up.  Clue for me?  <comment357082> How were you reaching the file? "Enter Time Machine" or manually? How far back does TM say it can go? TM prefs will give the earliest date possible to retrieve from. [& an ancillary to that - how big is your TM drive relative to the data it needs to store?] <comment357235> Have you encountered this problem before and, if so, what was the cause of it and how did you solve it?  Thank you. <comment357350> You didn't answer any of my questions :/
