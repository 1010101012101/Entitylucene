Shuffle by album disk in iTunes <body> How I shuffle by disk in iTunes?  Would I mean is if an album has 5 disks,  I like each disk to treated as a separate album only for shuffling purposes.  I think setting the sort album  to  disk number i.e.  codealbum name disk 1/code but this had no effect.  N.b.  this is strongnot/strong the same as shuffle by album.  Update: Changing the album title would work  but this would mean in the album view I have the same album multiple times, so I would prefer not to do that.  <comment210808> Untested, but you might have to change the album names themselves to reflect which disk; then it will treat them separately. <comment210968> That would work, but would mean in the album view I have the same album multiple times
