I currently have OS 10.6 want to upgrade OS <body> I currently have OS 10.6 - Safari and other browsers are no longer supported. My problem is I have Adobe CS4 Design and web software and I don't have a few thousand dollars hanging about to upgrade CS4 SO..... Does Lion work with Adobe CS4 - or should I just start saving my pennies for more expensive software? I had heard that OS 10.6 was the highest OS I could get with CS4.  <answer247490> It looks like you can use CS4 with Mavericks according to Adobe's site.     Is Adobe aware of any major issues, bugs, or odd user experiences when   using CS5, CS4, or CS3 products with Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9)?      Yes, Adobe Drive could cause the opening or saving of files to take   longer. See Files open, save slowly for more information.   <comment305424> I'm sure I'm not the first person to suggest this to you, but consider upgrading to Creative Cloud. I was in the same boat you are - I had the CS3 Master Collection, and couldn't afford to replace it. I waited until Adobe had a promotion, and I have the Creative Cloud "All Apps" package and I'm paying $29/mo. The price for one app is currently $20/mo. Being able to upgrade my OS -and- my Adobe products has been well worth it. <comment305434> Not sure about CS4, but I have CS5 or 5.5 and when I upgraded from 10.7 to 10.11, I had a little trouble at first and had to download special legacy Java, but it's pretty much fine now. <comment305439> Thank you - I was hoping that even upgrading to OS 10.7 (Lion) would be enough to be able to use browsers, I have been anxious about messing up what I have - and even 29 a month is a stretch for a retired person on a budget. CS4 works just fine and dandy for my needs - but then when you can't use the internet reliably because the browser isn't supported by your OS system - well - it's downright depressing! <comment305461> Be sure you do a backup first, just in case something, anything, goes wrong.
