Numbers Lookup Finding incorrect values <body> I have many tables with two columns (key-value style) and I want to combine all the values in a single table. I lookup key in a first column and insert a value from the second one. I've encountered an issue when a wrong key is looked up. Here is a simple example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hRBHZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  The codeRBYourselfNotUsedRule/code is not present in Table 1 and 271 belongs to codeRBVariableReferencedOnceRule/code. Does anybody have an idea why codeRBVariableReferencedOnceRule/code was looked up for codeRBYourselfNotUsedRule/code?  <answer282432> strongFrom Apple's Documentation:/strong     LOOKUP(search-for, search-where, result-values) search-for: The value   to find. search-value can contain any value.      search-where: The collection containing the values to be searched.   search-where can contain any values.      result-values: An optional collection containing the value to be   returned based on the search. result-values can contain any values.   If the codeLOOKUP/code function can't find the codesearch-for/code value, the function matches the largest value in codesearch-where/code that is less than or equal to codesearch-for/code.  This is why, when the formula cannot find the match, it returns the closest thing it can find.    You may need to use a more powerful function such as codeVLOOKUP/code or the combination codeINDEX(MATCH())/code     strongNotes/strongbr   VLOOKUP compares a search value to the values in the leftmost   column of a specified collection. Unless an exact match is required,   the row containing the largest left-column value that is less than or   equal to the search value is selected. Then, the value from the   specified column in that row is returned by the function. If an exact   match is required and none of the leftmost-column values match the   search value, the function returns an error.   When opting for the exact match, you could wrap the formula in a codeIFERROR()/code function to catch the "no match" error and return whatever you specify.  i.e.: code""/code empty string or other message. code"No Match"/code as a example.
