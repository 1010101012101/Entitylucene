How do I download a URL using Applescript <body> I used to be able to download URLs from an Applescript, but I lost the Applescript. I want to enter a URL: i.e.: "http://wpclassic.com/go.php?http://www.revolutiontwo.com/download/tv.zip" and have it prompt for a place to put the file.  <answer21247> precodeset the URLs to the text returned of (display dialog "Enter the URLs you would like to download. If you have more than one, separate them with commas please:" default answer "") set the destination to (choose folder with prompt "Choose the folder you want to download the URLs to:") set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "," repeat with this_URL in the URLs     tell application "URL Access Scripting" to download this_URL to the destination with progress and unpacking end repeat set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "" /code/pre  If you are using Lion, the above code won't work (Apple removed codeURL Access Scripting/code for some reason). Use the shell command codecurl/code instead, as shown below:  precodeset the URLs to the text returned of (display dialog "Enter the URLs you would like to download. If you have more than one, separate them with commas please:" default answer "") set the destination to (choose folder with prompt "Choose the folder you want to download the URLs to:") set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "," repeat with this_URL in the URLs       do shell script "curl -L " &amp; this_URL &amp; " -o " &amp; POSIX path of the destination  end repeat set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "" /code/pre  <comment23010> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18487/where-did-url-access-scripting-app-go-in-lion <comment23386> Just so you know...there should be a parenthese on the first line after "default answer""". <comment23425> @daviesgeek Wow did not see that. Thanks I will fix it. :) <comment23438> You are very welcome. <comment27219> AppleScript Editor gives me: error "URL Access Scripting got an error: Unsupported scheme" number -30774 <comment28556> @ghoppe Sort of, but I'm using SL. <comment43361> I think this worked. I will have to check to see if it did. <comment43768> Just before the curl line, I get a syntax error: Expected “end” but found unknown token. Anyone know why?
