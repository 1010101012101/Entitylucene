Looking for non Apple Music app for iOS that uses Box and equalizer <body> I'm sick of Apple Music. They hold my music files hostage because I don't own a computer, I only own Apple devices - iPad and iPhone. Apple's music app will only play music I bought from Apple. I have many, many other files. I have all my files in Box and in the Google Music app. It's ok and a good place to store my music but the iOS app doesn't have an equalizer and I'm finding the sound a bit lacking. I'm hoping someone here has some suggestions for a music app that will let me access my music from Box and has an equalizer OR if there's a way to use an equalizer outside of the Google app that will still work with its playback. I'm assuming Apple's equalizer only works when playing back music in its own app.
