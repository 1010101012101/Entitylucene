Using "&" and "|" in SSHPass script <body> I am making a script for my parents on their Mac's so that they can SSH into my Linux computer, and send commands, create popups etc.  This is one of my commands:  precodesshpass -p Password ssh maliciouzzhd@10.0.0.1 export DISPLAY=:0 &amp; mate-session-save --force-logout /code/pre  My problem is that the Mac treats the "&amp;" as not in the sshpass script, and executes the argument after using the Mac terminal, no SSH.  So  precodesshpass -p Password ssh maliciouzzhd@10.0.0.1 export DISPLAY=:0 &amp; mate-session-save --force-logout /code/pre  would execute  precodeexport DISPLAY=:0 /code/pre  in the SSH session, but  precodemate-session-save --force-logout /code/pre  would be executed in the Mac terminal.  If anyone could help me out with this, it would be greatly appreciated.  <answer271504> SSH accepts single argument as a command, not multiple ones, so the command line should look like this (note the quotes):  precodesshpass -p Password ssh maliciouzzhd@10.0.0.1 "export DISPLAY=:0 &amp; mate-session-save --force-logout" /code/pre  But the general idea might not work, because you didn't allow X11 forwarding (add code-Y/code switch to the codessh/code).  <comment341271> Thanks, it works, but it is now saying `Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused` <comment341272> Do you have X server installed on your mac? <comment341273> How do I check? I'm not use to Mac, its my parents <comment341274> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341 -- you need to install XQuartz manually <comment341276> Wait... I am trying to control my Linux laptop through SSH from my Mac, do I need XQuartz on my Mac too? My Linux definitely has XServer stuff on it. <comment341277> Yes, you need X server on the mac, if you want to show windows from your Linux system.
