contact groups not syncing with google <body> using 10.9.2. I had all my contacts in various groups on my mac. I uploaded to iCloud in order to import into google. The groups designations did not seem to go with the contacts to iCloud, so when i imported to google, none were in any groups.  Now when i set my mac to sync via google contacts, all the contacts are there but no groups.  Question: 1) can you get the group designations in mac to upload to iCloud 2) How can you have groups sync between google and mac.  thanks, Rick
