Where is the official Apple documentation for the Terminal App? I need a list of escape sequences <body> codeTerminal.app/code does not implement all codexterm/code sequences. I need to get the complete list of what it does implement. Is it available anywhere?  <answer90905> I'm not really sure that this is what you want, but...  Terminal - Preferences... - Settings - (select your default theme) - Keyboard.  Here you can see – and edit – a list of shortcuts. See also the "advanced" tab of the same panel.  <answer90907> This is a bit vague... what sequences are NOT implemented?  One simple solution would be to see if iTerm2 is a better fit to your needs.  Incidentally, have you tried:  precode~$ cat .bashrc export TERM=xterm-256color /code/pre  (I am setting my TERM to xterm-256color in my bashrc, so that I get a number of xterm-256color behaviour by default).  Having said that, a few google inspired links that you might find useful, or not, depending on the sequences you are looking for:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1375184?start=0&amp;tstart=0  http://taoofmac.com/space/apps/Terminal  <comment106725> in Terminal window hit the TAB twice, it display with a list of all commands, about 1400 of them :( <comment106727> @Buscar웃 those are the shell commands. Th OP is asking for the sequences to move the cursor which are emitted by commands etc <comment106794> The sequence that is not implemented is the one that changes the background color without having to clear the screen. I want each prompt to change the color so I know from screen color which machine I'm ssh'ed into.  I just checked and iTerm2 does not handle it. Here is the reference: http://superuser.com/questions/592090/change-xterm-change-background-color-without-clearing-the-screen/593228?noredirect=1#comment729128_593228 <comment106869> This is a tough one.  Are you ssh-ing from mac to Linux, from Linux to Mac or from Mac to Mac? <comment106870> it occurs to me that you might want to change the colour of the user@hostname rather than the background -- it would require setting it up in the bash or whatever shell setting you use, but it would need to be done just once. <comment106913> Actually, no. I really want the background changed, not the prompt. I got it working with applescript and the first hop, but the subsequent hops don't change.
