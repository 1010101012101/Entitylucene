Switch music playing from iPod to Mac when getting home <body> is there a way to automatically 'transfer' the music you hear on your iPod touch (4. generation) to the Mac?  What I want to do:  I am listening to music while I am on my way back home. I get home and my iPod touch connects to my access point. My Mac is awake and could be directed to play music via Remote on my iPod touch.  Can I sync both devices so they play the same song at the same time, so I can turn off my iPod and put away my headphones, but continue listening via my Mac?  <answer188572> Funny question - never loose the flow...  The only way I see is that you install a tool like Airfoil and have your Mac simulate an AirPlay device. Then once you get home and your iPod is logged into your WiFi you could select your Mac as the speaker.  <comment223197> The idea sounds good. Let's see if there will come any further replies. <comment223420> I tried it. The demo supports just 10 minutes until it adds noise, but thats not the problem. Until then I have a new song started on my Mac :D  The only problem I have is that I have to switch the AirPlay device. Is there a way to do this automatically? <comment223422> @Frozn You mean that you have to select the AirPlay speakers? Well now I'm out. Get an iPhone, VPN to your home, start iTunes with the remote app ;)
