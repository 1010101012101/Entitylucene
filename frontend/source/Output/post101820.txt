How do I prevent search terms from being copied between applications? <body> If I have a search field open in Xcode and Safari at the same time, switching between the apps will copy the search term from one app to the other.  To reproduce this:  ol liOpen a webpage in Safari, and press Cmd-F to search the page, but don't type anything/li liGo to the Find Navigator in Xcode, and type "xcodesearch"/li liUse the app switcher to go to Safari/li /ol  "xcodesearch" ends up in Safari's Find search field. Is there a setting that controls this? I don't want this to happen.  OS X 10.8.4, MacBook Air  <answer113718> To give you an answer the best I can with the research I've done. This is a relatively new addition in the OS. If I am not mistaken since 10.8 and what happened is Apple changed the Helper daemon.  I do not know of a way to configure the helperd parameters. My recommendation is to give Apple feedback via http://apple.com/feedback/ and ask that they give the ability to toggle it or remove it all together.  Additionally ask the mad scientists here to include the functionality  http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html  <comment126100> Came here to ask the same question. Happening between Coda and Text Wrangler for me. So annoying. Have you found a solution? <comment126252> Sorry, I don't have a solution yet. I haven't updated to Mavericks, so I don't know if the situation is different there. <comment209653> *It's not a bug, it's a feature !* Seriously, this feature appeared quite a few years ago. So there is a solution : downgrade to a quite old system, maybe Jaguar. I don't advise it. <comment209658> This "shared search" feature was added quite a few years ago. It is older than Mac OS X 10.8. I am almost sure that this feature is it *at least as old as Mac OS X 10.6*.
