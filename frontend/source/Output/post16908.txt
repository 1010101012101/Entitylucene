Mac webcam - get the device <body> How do I access my default video camera on my mac? I know on Linux it is /dev/video0 but my Mac does not have that. I'm trying to capture my webcam into ffmpeg  precodeffmpeg -i /dev/video0 /code/pre  But it won't work because /dev/video0 doesn't exist.  <answer16910> Unfortunately, it appears that ffmpeg can't record using the iSight, as reported in a ffmpeg-users thread.  Really a shame that Apple doesn't expose this functionality!  <answer19852> Macs use the AVFoundation framework to expose the camera programatically.  You'll want to start with the StopNGo sample project if you've got a copy of Xcode. (and just browsing the source may help figure if you care to go down that path without needing Xcode to make a decision)  It would be a big security risk to expose that API to the terminal on every mac by default, but someone may have writen a bridge you could use.   You might need to ask that specifically on the programming sites. Your query looking for an equivalent to attaching a pre-existing device is advanced consumer and on-topic here. Getting into API usage is generally off topic even when the simple "consumer" answer is "no - the equivalent video device isn't available on Mac OS X"  <comment21829> Technically, the API for calling the camera exists in the Aqua layer, so you would have to negotiate that entire framework. It's a huge security risk so I doubt it will ever be made as easy as `/dev/videoX`, but I've been way wrong before :-) <comment21835> Also - why not expand the question to say what you want to do - there might be many built in tools that do what you want to do even if your familiar tool is missing. You might be looking for a knife and some matches when the mac has delivery service and you could straight out just order a pizza. <comment25717> Some great programs that help in capture video have popped up over there [command line control of the built in camera](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/18160/command-line-control-of-the-built-in-camera)
