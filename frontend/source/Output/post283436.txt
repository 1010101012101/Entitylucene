How to use EasyFind (or a similar application) to search inside ~/Library? <body> I would like to use EasyFind to search inside the folder code~/Library/Application\ Support/Anki2//code. Unfortunately, the codeLibrary/code subfolder is not listed under the home folder in the codeSelect A Folder.../code dialog box. Is there a way around it? Alternatively, is there another file-searching GUI-based application that will enable me to search inside said folder?  <answer283510> The simplest way is to just tell EasyFind to search the entire drive for invisibles.  It's not very efficient, but it's very easy.  Alternatively, it will search any folder you drag to the 'location' drop menu.    For a folder which is normally hidden, such as ~/Library, there are several methods to reveal it.  ul liFinder  Go Menu - hold kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd &amp; the User Library will be revealed in the menubr sup From comments, this may be yet another of those commands that changes by System Language. Adding Shift may apparently be necessary in some languages./sup/li liUse the Go To Folder... command from the Go Menu or kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd  &amp; type code~/Library/codebr You can always go to any invisible folder this way, however deeply it's nested, for instance code~/Library/Application Support/Anki2//code.

Press enter after you've entered your pass. If you want to hide that folder again: `sudo chflags hidden "/Library"`. Note that even thought it is hidden, you can still open that folder in finder if you do `Go  Go to Folder...` and enter `/Library`. <comment357433> ^ Note it's ~/Library not /Library. It probably doesn't need `sudo` either, as it's your own folder. <comment357434> Nor does it need the quotes -  `chflags nohidden ~/Library` rather than `chflags nohidden "~/Library"` <comment357470> Thanks. Very exhaustive. I'd like to comment about your first bullet point. In my system it's not enough to hold down Opt ⌥; you need to hold down Shift ⇧ too. <comment357471> Odd. Never heard of that. adding opt or shift can often make alternative menus appear, but for me using both does nothing. I'm on UK English, what are you on?
