Upgrade from 10.5.8 to Mountain Lion <body> Is it possible for me with a 2007 iMac running Leopard (2.16 Ghz Intel 2 Duo and 2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM) to upgrade to Mountain Lion? If not, is there any later version I can upgrade to? If I can upgrade to Mountain Lion, do I need to install an earlier version first? And if so, how do I do this?   <answer99395> h2Edit/h2  As pointed out by Kent, an iMac with a 2.16 Ghz Intel 2 Duo seems to be like an iMac (Late 2006) instead of an iMac (Mid 2007).  Technical Specs for iMac (Late 2006)  Technical Specs for iMac (Late 2007)  Therefore, you can only run Lion. Unfortunately, finding a legitimate copy of Lion could be a little tricky if you haven’t already purchased it. If you search for OS X Lion in the Mac App Store you’ll only find Mountain Lion, and Apple no longer sells an OS X Lion USB Thumb Drive (part number MD256Z/A) in its online store. One of your options is to buy from Amazon or another online retailer.  Or, get Snow Leopard.  h2Original Post/h2  You have to install Snow Leopard first and then Mountain Lion.  h2OS X Mountain Lion system requirements/h2  To install Mountain Lion, you need one of these Macs:  precode**iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)** (Yours) MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer) MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer) MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer) Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer) Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer) Xserve (Early 2009) /code/pre  Your Mac needs:  precodeOS X v10.6.8 or OS X Lion already installed 2 GB or more of memory 8 GB or more of available space /code/pre  Your model must have a 64-bit EFI boot ROM.  An easy way to tell if you are running a K64 kernel is to use the uname command-line program. The "x86_64" in the excerpt below means that we are running a 64-bit kernel. If the output showed "i386" instead, that would mean a 32-bit kernel.  codeuname -a Darwin... root:xnu-1456.1.25~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64/code  Therefore, you need to upgrade to Snow Leopard first.  h2Other Things/h2  AirDrop and AirPlay will strongnot/strong work on your computer.  h2Sources/h2  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5444  hr  h2Alternate Way/h2  It is empossible/em, but not necessarily legal, to install Mountain Lion over Leopard.  You can look at this.  <answer99441> The cut-off for Mountain Lion compatibility is mid-2007 iMacs.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5444  It looks like yours is before that (2.16 GHz was the last rev of white plastic models).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_(Intel-based)  You might be able to acquire a USB installer for 10.7 -- (http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mac-Lion-Thumb-Drive/dp/B0089FELB2 for example) but, you will still have the same problems mentioned in sameetandpotatoes comment.  <comment116932> In addition to AirDrop not working, AirPlay also will not. <comment116934> @sameetandpotatoes uname gives: Darwin my-computer-1259.local 9.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 9.8.0: Wed Jul 15 16:55:01 PDT 2009; root:xnu-1228.15.4~1/RELEASE_I386 i386 <comment116936> Your computer is running a 32-bit kernel. If your computer does not boot into the 64-bit kernel automatically you can force it to by restarting and holding down the "6" and "4" keys after the chime. Re-run the above command in Terminal. If you don't see "x86_64" then your model does not have a 64-bit EFI boot ROM and cannot boot Mountain Lion. <comment116990> I think the 2.16GHz iMac is a late-2006 model; not mid-2007. <comment116991> Kent, you are right. I just checked the Apple Support pages. Thank you for noticing; I will update my answer.
