How can I make a folder and its contents automatically owned by two people? <body> Ok, in the code/Users/Shared//code folder I have my codeDropBox/code folder.  I have read/write permissions set for me and my wife (shared computer).  However, if she creates a folder/file in the DropBox folder, I can see it but I have to type in my password to delete or edit it.  And she has to do the same if I create something.  How can I make it so that if she creates a file/folder in the DropBox folder, we both automatically are the owners?  It doesn't seem to me that the codeShared/code folder does a very good job of, well, SHARING.  Even though I have set both of our accounts as read/write on Shared and all contents.  This is driving me insane.    Thanks.  <answer77013> I think that batter solution for that will be installing on other computer another instance of dropbox app? You can use your same credentials or other (with sharing enabled within dropbox site).   It will enable other computer to access files when your computer will be sleep/off.    <answer77014> You can solve this problem using group permissions. What you want is to have a file mode creation mask set such that group read, write, and execute permissions are automatically set for each file when a file is created. This can be accomplished using the codeumask/code command inside your startup script such as code~/.bash_profile/code. To set coderw/code permissions on all files, coderwx/code on all directories, that you both create, use  precode# Set the umask such that user and group can read, write, and execute. umask u=rwx,g=rwx,o= /code/pre  Furthermore, you may want to set everything in the Dropbox to have at a minimum coderw/code group permissions for files and coderwx/code permissions for folders. You can accomplish this using  precodechmod -R g+r,g+w /Users/Shared /code/pre  for files and use  precodechmod -R g+x /Users/Shared/FOLDER /code/pre  for folders. You can view the existing permissions in the terminal using  precodels -l /Users/Shared /code/pre  where the coderwx/code permissions are arranged in order of owner, group, and other.  <answer77015> OS X has two main levels of file-level credential control:  ul liusers/li ligroups/li /ul  Right now, it sounds like your wife has "ownership" of the dropbox folder, much to your frustration.  To rectify this, you will want to use the Users and Groups preference panel to either   ol liem(if everyone who uses the computer can have access to the dropbox folder)/em proceed to the last step, using the strongeveryone/strong access control group./li liem(if you have multiple people using the computer, but only you and your wife can have access to the dropbox folder)/em create a new group, perhaps called strongDropbox/strong, and  add you and your wife's accounts to this group./li liem(if both you and your wife understand the power of being Administrator, and both you and your wife would be the only Administrator on this computer)/em add both your and your wife's account to the strongAdministers/strong group./li liSet the permissions on the Dropbox folder to give full control to this group from 1 through 3. ul liIn Finder, select the Dropbox folder and press CMD-I (Get Info). /li liYou might need to unlock the panel if you see the locked padlock in the lower right corner.

I've given the same procedure using the graphical interface. <comment89327> Thanks, @TomUnderhill, for adding some alternative ways to go about this using the GUI.
