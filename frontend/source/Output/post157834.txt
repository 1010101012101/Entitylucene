how to add the white border and 'peeling' shadow to a photo in Pages? <body> It's been a while since I used Pages, but the last time I used it, I dragged and dropped a photo into a blank document and there were options to add nice borders to the photo.  Specifically, I added an effect which made the photo look like it was peeling off the page on the left and right side, and there was a shadow underneath each corner giving it a 3d appearance.  I can't for the life of me find that feature in Pages (using Page '09).  <answer157844> I'm not sure it's the same effect you're looking for, but to apply different borders in Pages I followed these steps:  ol liPlace the picture where you want it in your document/li liOpen the codeInspector/code by holding kbdCMD/kbd+kbdI/kbd/li liGo to the codeGraphic/code tab: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TDcYj.png" alt="enter image description here"  /li liGo to the codeStroke/code menu and choose codePicture Frame/code from the drop-down menu. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hzpu.png" alt="enter image description here"  /li liNow you can choose a picture frame and alter its appearance by using the codeScale/code slider./li /ol
