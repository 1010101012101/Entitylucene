How to get F-keys of Apple Keyboard to behave like F-keys in Windows? <body> When using an Apple keyboard in Windows using Bootcamp drivers, how can I change the behaviour of kbdF1-12/kbd so that they are normally just kbdF1-12/kbd and the special functionality (play, pause, brightness control etc.) is available using kbdfn/kbd+kbdF1-12/kbd?  <comment254089> Are you on Windows 10? It looks that OS may be having issues. Otherwise, it's probably a driver issue. <comment254093> Windows 7. What issues are you thinking of? I think the OS and keyboard are operating as documented at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202676 but I would like to override the defaults wrt. function keys.  That is, have all function keys act like function keys, and only invoke the media/special functions with fn.
