How do I change my language to spanish on Pages 8? <body> My computer is a PowerPC running Pages 08. I am now living in Spain and would like to know how to change the language.  I would like to have Pages 08 in English, but I would like it to spell check in Spanish.  <answer217883> Inspector  Text  More  Language  <comment260601> What version of OS X are you running?  You just change it to spanish and Pages will be in Spanish.  Or are you talking about spellcheck? <comment263358> I have edited my question.
