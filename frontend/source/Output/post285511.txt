Force screensharing to open new session <body> I'm looking for a setup where any new screen sharing (VNC) connection to macOS Sierra will create a new session, instead of sharing the session with the user that is physically logged in.  What I got so far is this: if I activate the legacy VNC support (using a shared password), then connecting using a VNC client will not attempt to take over the existing session, but create a new one.  The problem with that behavior is: when nobody is logged in, connecting through VNC will take over the regular desktop, so somebody with physical access will be able to see what's going on. I'd rather prefer a "strict" terminal server mode where the user is guaranteed to get a session that doesn't get shared.  How can I achieve such a setup?
