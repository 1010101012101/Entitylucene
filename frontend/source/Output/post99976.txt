Lost Data on Macbook Pro <body> After I could not boot my Macbook Pro (OS X Lion 10.7.5) I tried to run safe boot. I thought it worked, but only thing it did was booting the mac without any data i used to have. All the software is there. It's like a brand new mac with full applications. My storage seems as full as before so I know the data is somewhere inside my Macbook. How can I find them? (I'm still logged in as I always were and there seems to be no other accounts)  P.S: I know the ways that requires payment, but I (with my ignorant logic) conclude that since my storage is still seems full with everything I have I may not need it.   Edit: ALSO i downloaded data rescue demo to scan. But for some reason my HD can't be scanned. When I tried Disk Warrior it says "Directory cannot be rebuild because this is the startup disk"  <answer99983> search your computer with Grand Prespective and it will show you your entire mac, and what and where the data is  <comment117632> Did you have a look at your Trash? Did you try to use Spotlight to search for some file names/content you remember? <comment117633> Yes I did. Trash is empty and spotlight doesn't come up with anything @patrix <comment117673> no problem glad i could be of assistance
