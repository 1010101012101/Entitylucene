Lion - customize toolbar <body> In Snow Leopard you could right click an application toolbar icon and select "Remove item", this is no longer possible in Lion. If I select "Customize toolbar" I get the customization panel, but it's not possible to do any changes.  Anyone know if this is a bug or intentional?  Any way around it?  <answer20159> Have you tried, when in Customize Toolbar, to drag the items out of the actual toolbar? It works for me in Safari.  <answer20163> kbdâŒ˜CMD/kbd-drag to get the item out of the toolbar.  <comment37140> same here.. (10.7.2)
