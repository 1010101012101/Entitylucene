How to get Apple TV to start an iPhoto slideshow in the middle? <body> I have a photo album in iPhoto '11.  To stream it to my Apple TV (3rd gen), I open iTunes '11 and do emFile/em  emHome Sharing/em  emChoose Photos to Share with Apple TV/em.  I select my photo album from the list and click emSync/em.  Now on Apple TV, I choose emComputers/em  emRobert's Library/em  emPhotos/em  My Photo Album.  I see a screen of thumbnails, all photos in the album.  I go to the top of the screen, choose emSlideshow/em  emStart Slideshow/em, and the slideshow starts from the first photo.  My problem is, I was showing the slideshow to my family (216 photos), and half way through we got interrupted by dinner so I stopped the slideshow.  Later, we sat down again to watch the rest, but there doesn't appear to be a way to start the slideshow from where we left off.  I tried navigating the thumbnails to the last photo we saw, and select it, but that only provides for viewing individual photos and I have to manually next-next-next through the photos to watch them.  Is there any way to start the slideshow from a specific photo in the album?  Any info or suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks!  <answer96897> Make a new album in iphoto with the remaining photos and start on appleTV that album  <answer221032> You can use third party apps now and those make it easier to create and show slideshows from the middle. One in particular that I like is Slidez but there are others such as Storehouse. Go to the App Store and do a search from your Apple TV. Good luck.  <comment269518> Thanks for the good workaround suggestion.
