EFI automounts on startup <body> After upgrading to the newest El Capitan from 10.10. to 10.11.1 - I guess - the normally invisible EFI partition appears on the desktop as a regular volume on different machines, if I choose to show the volumes in the finder preferences.   When I start "First Aid" with Disk utility the EFI partition get ejected, but on the next start they will appear again. I can boot in Recovery Mode and El Capitan seems to work fine (as fine as it can).  But how can I get OS X not to autoload the EFI partition and hide it again?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LqbQW.jpg&lt;br" alt="visible volumes desktop"     Admins Mac Pro:~ admin$ diskutil info /Volumes/EFIbr   Device Identifier:        disk0s1br   Device Node:              /dev/disk0s1br   Whole:                    Nobr   Part of Whole:            disk0br   Device / Media Name:      EFI System Partitionbr   Volume Name:              EFIbr   Mounted:                  Yesbr   Mount Point:              /Volumes/EFIbr   File System Personality:  MS-DOS FAT32br   Type (Bundle):            msdosbr   Name (User Visible):      MS-DOS (FAT32)br   Partition Type:           EFIbr   OS Can Be Installed:      Nobr   Media Type:               Genericbr   Protocol:                 SATAbr   SMART Status:             Verifiedbr   Volume UUID:              0E239BC6-F960-3107-89CF-1C97F78BB46Bbr   Disk / Partition UUID:    BF3A02F5-1B7F-4F5C-9E27-2C3378181F53br   Total Size:               209.7 MB (209715200 Bytes) (exactly 409600 512-Byte-Units)br   Volume Free Space:        181.5 MB (181542912 Bytes) (exactly 354576 512-Byte-Units)br   Device Block Size:        512 Bytesbr   Allocation Block Size:    512 Bytesbr   Read-Only Media:          Nobr   Read-Only Volume:         Nobr   Device Location:          Internalbr   Removable Media:          Nobr   Solid State:              Nobr   <answer217648> Since El Capitan this is the behavior of Workgroupmanager for local accounts if you enable to manage internal harddrives to be only readable for some users. It doesn't matter which user logs in. If there is only one user managed, the EFI partition will show up on start for all useres. Disabling this in Workgroupmanager again hides the EFI partition, too.  Since Workgroupmanager was lastly updated on Mavericks it is still possible to manage e.g. USB shares to be only readable without having to install a OSX Server, as there is no on board solution for managing user accounts more differentiated than with System preferences.  <comment263113> Actually this helped me, even it is my own answer...
