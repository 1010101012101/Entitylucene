How can I change sound depth and frequency characteristics in GarageBand? <body> How can I change depth (bits) and frequency (kHzs) characteristics when recording session in GarageBand?  If I can't then what are the default values?  <answer11073> You cannot change depth and frequency of the recorded samples, even when changing the input settings in the codeAudio MIDI Setup.app/code (this is the way to change playback and recording settings for sound devices). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvtpU.png" alt="Audio Devices setup in Audio MIDI Setup.app" The default values for Garage Band are 44kHz, 16 bit, stereo. They are kept in AIFF format. You can explore them by right-clicking your garage band project and choosing codeShow package contents/code. The recorded files are kept in the codeMedia/code folder.  emEdit (added Logic 9):/embr In Logic 9 you can change the sampling rate (frequency) from the codeProject Settings/code window, codeAudio/code tab. Explained in the Logic 9 Manual - Setting the Sample rate. To change the bit depth you should go to codePreferences/code - codeAudio/code and check/uncheck code24 bit recording/code (It's checked by default). It's covered in the Logic 9 Manual - Setting the project bit depth.  <answer192498> Using TechTools Pro you can manipulate the default audio frequency.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kEb8S.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment11567> Thanks, brilliant answer. And maybe you know, could I change those values in Logic? <comment11568> @NR4TR I don't have Logic, but it's in the manual - yes you can. I'll edit my answer. <comment11639> Cool, thanks again. It's a pity that I cannot upvote again :)
