Strange bar in bottom of my desktop (El Capitan, MBP end 2015) <body> Something similar has been reported before, but that was resolved after quitting all applications and restarting the computer.  My bar stays after restarting, also it might look like a scrollbar, but there is nothing to scroll to begin with as I have placed the Dock on the left side of my screen for the purpose of this screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uHTEA.png" alt="strange bar on desktop El Capitan MBP"  Anyone has any idea what it is and/or tip to make it go away?  <comment269499> Screenshot resolution is not enough to see clearly. And beside, you have so many apps running (in menubar), probably this black bar belongs to one of them? <comment269612> @ranklord I changed the image to one where you can better see it. It does not belong to any apps. If I quit everything, it still shows.
