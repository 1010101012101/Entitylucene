Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.0.dylib <body> I'm trying to use subversion, SVN, through the terminal on my Mac OS X 10.10, Yosemite. I installed Xcode and the Developer tools, and I installed svn via homebrew. whenever I try to run svn, I receive this error:    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeJakes-MacBook-Pro:~ JakeEvans$ brew install svn ==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/subversion-1.8.13.yosemite Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/subversion-1.8.13.yosemite.bottle.tar.gz ==&gt; Pouring subversion-1.8.13.yosemite.bottle.1.tar.gz ==&gt; Caveats svntools have been installed to:   /usr/local/opt/subversion/libexec  Bash completion has been installed to:   /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d ==&gt; Summary  /usr/local/Cellar/subversion/1.8.13: 116 files, 9.2M Jakes-MacBook-Pro:~ JakeEvans$ svn dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/lib/libaprutil-1.0.dylib   Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/svn   Reason: image not found Trace/BPT trap: 5 /code/pre  I've done everything I can possibly think of, including attempting to install apache, php55, and some other things that I've found suggested elsewhere on the internet, and either they've installed correctly but I'm still left with the issue, or I get to the point where I am ready to use the 'make' command, but the make process fails, due to some sort of error with the makefile:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code(Cannot find %, or something like Makefile:78: *** multiple target patterns.  Stop.).  /code/pre  I'm pretty new to the whole linux/unix thing, and actually have only owned a mac for about 3 months now, so I'm at a loss.  <answer197992> There is no absolute need to install subversion, codesvn/code, via codehomebrew/code. Try removing the homebrew edition using:  precodebrew uninstall svn /code/pre  Then launch a new Terminal.app window and enter the command:  precodesvn --version /code/pre  If you have Xcode's command line tools installed, the command should work.  If this does not work, see Xcode 4.4 and later install Command Line Tools for how to install Xcode and the tools.  I mention using a new Terminal.app window because when each window is created, your code.bash_profile/code is run and the command line environment is set up. The environment can change after installing and removing software. Those changes may not be noticed until a new terminal session is begun.  h2Beyond Xcode's Subversion/h2  The subversion included with Xcode is typically a little out of date. Usable but not the absolute latest version.  If you emneed/em features introduced with the latest subversion, then consider using homebrew or MacPorts to install your own subversion.  h2Which binary?/h2  Given that multiple versions of svn have been installed, and that your codePATH/code may be altered, try running:  precodewhich svn /code/pre  This will show you the full path to the first binary found matching the name codesvn/code.  The following command will print the search paths used when looking for matching binaries:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  <comment236820> Thanks for the clear answer, but it's not working. I did exactly what you said by uninstalling homebrew's svn, and I already had the command line tools installed. When I typed 'svn' the console said 'command not found'. I think I messed with the path at one point. I instead typed '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/svn', and received the original error message. <comment236821> Trying creating a new user account and trying the `svn --version` command. Does it work in the other account? If so, the problem is likely in your `.bash_profile` or `PATH` environment. <comment236831> Tried that: created a new user through the GUI with admin rights, closed the terminal window, opened a new one, and typed 'su testuser', entered the password, then typed svn --version... same error message. <comment236834> Try logging in as the new user. `su username` is close but not equivalent. If the error continues, it is likely the system wide svn binary has been overwritten. <comment236844> Graham, I did that, same error. Guess I can try uninstalling the command line tools and re-installing... I'll try that in the meantime. <comment236847> Uninstalled and reinstalled. No change, still the same exact error.
