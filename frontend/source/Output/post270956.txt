Way to send Computer audio wirelessly (wifi or bluetooth) to iOS device to be heard on its speakers? <body>    Inspired by this question over on Ask Ubuntu:      A method to send Ubuntu's (16.04) audio over WiFi to iOS (10.2) device?   Is there a way to stream audio from another computer (whether it's Linux, Mac, or Windows) to an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) such that the audio can play over the iOS device?  I know there are solutions for Android or such, but was curious if there's a solution or method to do this with iOS devices.  <answer271082> You can buy a bluetooth to audio jack adapter:  https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Stereo-Adapter-Transmitter/dp/B00RHKYX7W  This way you should be able to use it as an amplifier using Garage Band amp on your iPhone.  It should work just like so:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkL0bIx-ESk
