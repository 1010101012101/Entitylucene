Will a crontab job wake OS X up from sleep? <body> Since OS X has its own task scheduler, launchd, it appears that crontab is a relic.   Hence I'm wondering: Will a cron job (crontab) wake OS X up from sleep?  In case it matters, I'm on Yosemite 10.10.5.  Why I'm not switching to launchd? Laziness:  precode&gt; man launchctl | wc      463    2975   27730 &gt; man crontab | wc       72     433    3577 /code/pre  The man page is a lot larger, and crontab does everything I need.  <answer228775> codecron/code doesn't execute while the computer is asleep. So codecron/code can't wake your system.

A little testing should show you, as an example, if waking the Mac from sleep at 2:55AM with `pmset`, a `cron` job set for 3:00AM will run as expected. <comment279011> Have you tried it?
