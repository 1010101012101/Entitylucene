iMac 2011 disconnects from wifi frequently <body> Around every 5 minutes my iMac 2011 disconnects from the wifi.  It is running 10.9.5.  I don't think that this is a hardware problem because I can get the wifi to work again by disconnecting then reconnecting.  This only happens on the iMac, not on any other devices.  This has happened before, it stopped eventually.  Please help.   <comment335200> If you boot into Recovery Mode or Safe Mode, are you able to connect to the network reliably? <comment335641> yes, I think @Allan
