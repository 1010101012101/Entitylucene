Setting print size preset in AppleScript <body> I've been using Folder Actions to automate printing photos taken from OS X built-in Photo Booth software. The AppleScript I use is as follows:  precodeon adding folder items to this_folder after receiving added_items     try         tell application "Canon iP2700 series"             activate             print added_items             quit         end tell     end try end adding folder items to /code/pre  Is there anyway I can set the print job to use a preset size using strongAppleScript/strong or maybe strongchange the defaults/strong so that AppleScript prints uses that size by default?  I've noticed that they use the size at:  System Preferences  Printers &amp; Scanners  Default paper size  But I require the printer to print at 75x105mm which is not in any preset.  <answer188758> If I say anything that you already know I apologize.  It all starts with your printer capability.  Does the Canon supports that size?  Open a app like TextEdit and use the "Page Setup".  Now select your printer and select the print size if available. If not available use the Manage Custom Size and add new size (+) and the dimensions.  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HIgRA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Set it up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AXvDl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Now go to Print (in TextEdit) and select the Printer &amp; Scanner preferences and select default size.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qLTzw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  size img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPGTl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment223496> Yes, I can print the custom size I want via print dialog just fine. I am attempting to do the same thing using only AppleScript. <comment223499> Now when you use your AppleScript to print it will print in that selected size. <comment223501> Oh. Sorry, I missed out a portion of your answer. I'm gonna try it out. Thanks so much
