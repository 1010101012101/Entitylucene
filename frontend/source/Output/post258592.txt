Why did my entire Safari window just roll around in a circle? <body> At the time it happened I was typing the phrase code(rollback changes/code into a text field, and I think I accidentatlly hit command during typing that. The entire window rotated 360Â°, fairly slowly.  I can't repeat it.  <comment323300> It may have just been the contents of the window, so possibly it is an easter egg in the site I was on, which was [toggl](http://toggl.com).
