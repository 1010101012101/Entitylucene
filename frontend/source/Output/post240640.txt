Bootcamp - Lost 200GB as Bootcamp froze on "while partitioned" for 5~ hours <body> I was installing Windows 10 via Bootcamp on my iMac (27-inch, Late 2013) running OS X El Capitan - Version 10.11.4.   What happen was yesterday Bootcamp froze on "while partitioned" for around 5 hours. This slowed my computer considerably down and upon research online I found this amount of time was not normal and as I knew little about Bootcamp I force quit it (I realise that was really stupid, but it happened). I then found that I lost 200GB of hard drive space not being shown in disk utility or anything, currently when using Bootcamp the error which comes up is "The disk could not be partitioned".   I tried multiple fixes online such as looking through disk utility and going into some sort of white and black text mode and typing stuff in.  EDIT: Command I wrote in when holding Command + S during startup was codesbin/fsck -fy/code   Here is the partition map of disk0:  precode    start       size  index  contents         0          1         PMBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2         32         Pri GPT table        34          6                 40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640  236306352      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 236715992     262144      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 236978136          7          236978143         32         Sec GPT table 236978175          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  partition map of disk1:  precode     start        size  index  contents          0           1         PMBR          1           1         Pri GPT header          2          32         Pri GPT table         34           6                  40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     409640  5858853728      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 5859263368     1269760      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 5860533128           7          5860533135          32         Sec GPT table 5860533167           1         Sec GPT header` /code/pre  codediskutil cs list/code output:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 11B03F1B-D92D-4B61-BCC9-F134E39E6C5B     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         3120721960960 B (3.1 TB)     Free Space:   201535127552 B (201.5 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 3F02FF76-C5DF-4DBA-8F1F-86FE1A350A01     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120988852224 B (121.0 GB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume C6C852A4-FC2B-4C57-9A28-72B833CF80F0     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    1     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     2999733108736 B (3.0 TB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 7EA46506-2092-46DE-9D8C-67CCD88D1A8A         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         None         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume F121E76E-FDD4-405A-8566-1122FD35BC5F             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          2912999964672 B (2.9 TB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS             LVG Type:              Fusion, Sparse /code/pre  <answer243081> The 200 GB of your hard drive spaces were partially formatted with NTFS and went unrecognized due to a failed installation. There are couple of options which may work out. strongFirst/strong: A fresh install of the OS X after you have backed up the Macintosh HDD. strongSecond/strong, a third party software that can reformat the 200 GB of HDD space to OS X Extended Journaled.  <comment295860> Possible duplicate of [Lost hard drive space to Boot Camp](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/223833/lost-hard-drive-space-to-boot-camp) <comment295885> Please remove your older comments. The internals of your Logical Volume Group 11B03F... got corrupted. AFAIK this won't affect your currently working OS X logical volume F121E76E.... But you can't repair nor resize the logical volume or logical volume group. the only solution I know of is backing up your data, recreating the Fusion drive and restoring your data. <comment295952> Deleted them, but I have a hard drive but it doesn't have enough space for everything on my Mac. Would it be possible to run Bootcamp from the hard drive? @klanomath <comment295953> AFAIR/K you can install Windows with the BootCamp Assistant only from the internal disk to the internal disk. So installing OS X on the external disk and booting to it to run BCA and install Windows on a second partition of the external disk won't work. <comment295956> Well that's terrible for me, thanks anyway though. You tried to help and I thank you for that, now all I can do is regret my decision of quitting bootcamp. <comment295957> Hmm get a 3 TB (~$110) or 4 TB (~$150) external hard drive and configure it as Time Machine backup drive.
