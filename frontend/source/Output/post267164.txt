iOS 'convert to pdf' tools produce incomplete conversions <body> On Mac, the print dialog 'Save to pdf' features captures all types of images and image-like things.   On iPad, the tools I have tried run into problems, e.g.:  ol liOn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable, no MathML is included in the conversion or only that which appears on the first page or two./li liOn http://www.businessinsider.com/7-gifs-trigonometry-sine-cosine-2013-5, the animated gifs are properly converted to single static images, but surrounding text is lost./li /ol  Do any tools work properly on these webpages?  <answer267347> I posted similarly to ipadforums, received a suggestion from twerpoet, and pursued that path to identify some solutions that worked for the above web pages.
