What are your "must-have" MacPorts? <body> I hate to be all cliché with yet another "best [something]" question, but I am genuinely interested in what you most often install with MacPorts. When you get a new Mac, which ports do you first install?  So far, I've installed strongwget/strong and strongwatch/strong, since I find those to be very useful on Linux machines. I also installed strongwine/strong and strongwinetricks/strong to run a Windows program or two. And earlier today I started playing with Scala, so I installed the strongscala28/strong port.  emTip: to see your installed ports, use the codeport installed/code command./em  <answer5191> I just compile from source, since all of the important programs build easily on Mac OS X these days. Here's a great article on the advantages of building your own stuff vs. using package managers.  Having said that, here's my quick list:  ul liMercurial /li liGit/li liGNU Privacy Guard 1.4.x/li liffmpeg/li liMySQL Best directions I've seen for building 32 or 64-bit MySQL on Mac OS X: DIYMacServer/li /ul  <answer5193> First thing I do is update to the latest bash version... then I usually grab some updated versions of utilities:  ul ligrep/li lisudo/li liman/li liinfo (although i had to go with the fink version for this, macports is bugged)/li ligdiff/li /ul  Then on to my development tools like subversion, git, vim, macvim, python3, etc.  I heart MacPorts :P  <answer6564> In no particular order:  ul ligit - git/li lisigning-party - GnuPG key signing utils, pulls in GnuPG as well/li lintop - A Unix tool that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does./li lisslscan - sslscan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the ciphers that are supported/li liwatch - execute a program periodically, showing output fullscreen/li linmap - Network port scan to see what ports are open/li licoreutils GNU coreutils.

Please vote to reopen or ask on [meta] if it's not clear how this can be kept current by editing and community care. <comment83574> @bmike I don't understand - will it somehow be better maintained in a closed state, or are you "giving up" on it? (if the latter, why not just delete it then?) As a fellow mod, I would have thought community wiki would be enough. <comment83609> Non-trusted users aren't seeing the "broken windows" that we as moderators do (by design). If you'd like a discussion, please ask on [meta] and we can go into details on what we're doing / why / and how this question fits into our process. <comment211820> instead of ~~oh-my-zsh~~, try prezto instead <comment234442> +1 for bash-completion. I was wanting something like that.
