How can I get a Fluid.app SSB to go back using a two finger swipe? <body> When using Firefox and Safari, I have become accustomed to using a two-finger gesture to go backwards or forwards.   It's a drag that I can't get this to work on my Fluid.app SSBs.   Does anyone know a way?   <answer144874> I use the BetterTouch Tool application to handle two-finger swipe gestures with my Fluid SSBs. It works for me but you do have to set it up for each SSB, not just Fluid itself. Thankfully there is a copy gestures option.
