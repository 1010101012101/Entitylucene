What is the real meaning of the "WiFi strength" indictor? <body> In the WiFi list, I see full signal for my WiFi. Since I'm quite far away from the access point and the WiFi works poorly, I double checked the signal strength with WiFi Diagnostics. This tool tells me - no surprise - that I have a weak signal.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ujKcF.png" alt="WiFi strength symbol"  The symbol indicates full signal strength, even though I have a week signal. What is this symbol good for then?  <answer221407> it is just a bug of the icon at manu bar, if logging out and back is not working or even rebooting your mac, try this:  ol liClick the icon- turn wi-fi off- then turn it back on again/li liDo a reboot 3 Reset the router (unplug it from the mains and leave the capacitors to drain for half an hour or so)/li liDo an SMC reset which appertains to 'unusual system behaviour' like yours Intel-based Macs: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC)/li liThere is some advice on plists here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4149916 but it concerns an aberration post-Mavericks install with regards to the presence of an exclamation mark on the icon. Apple hid the library a couple of upgrades ago so if you want to go this route eventually then hold the alt key down whilst clicking Go on the Finder menu bar./li /ol  source: Mac Forums
