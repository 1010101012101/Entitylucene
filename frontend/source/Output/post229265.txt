OS X Safari: Disable private browsing entirely? <body> Is there a way to disable private browsing entirely in OS X 10.11 Safari? I found some older sites where you could edit MainMenu.nib in XCode, but that turned out not to be possible. You are supposed to 'Show Package Contents' on Safari, and find it in the folder codeContents/Resources/English.lproj/code and edit MainMenu.nib, but it is not there. And I also read some other place not to bother, because it is compiled.  <answer252554> I had the same question. Couldn't find any answers even after talking with an apple tech engineer. Basically they don't want you screwing around with their stuff. So I gave up and decided to use google chrome because I found a way to disable incognito mode on youtube.  Here's what I did. Well here is my work around. Silly you can't just edit the plist in safari to hide private browsing from the mainmenu.nib but this works too. 1. download google chrome 2. use this youtube video https://youtu.be/qF6UmSrR6ZQ and the free application pref setter to disable/hide incognito mode (the equivalent to private browsing in safari). Unlike safari, this way actually allows you to change the plist and disable incognito mode. Just a note - you need to use the IncognitoModeAvailability and then set it to Integer then set it to 1.  3. use this website's http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/05/disable-rootless-system-integrity-protection-mac-os-x/ instructions to disable SIP on OS X El Capitan. 4. after the reboot you can find the safari application, right click, unlock the padlock on the bottom right, and set all of the permissions to "no access" or "read only". Then if you try to access safari nothing will happen.  5. Use google chrome, which after following steps 1 &amp; 2 no longer has incognito mode as an option.  <comment279668> Anything an admin does can be undone by another admin, so whatever is it you're trying to do would have to be on a Standard account. What exactly are you trying to achieve? <comment279673> Since OS X 10.11 has System Integrity Protection - the steps may depend on the exact version of Safari and OS X. Might you edit that into the body and/or explain what specific nib you can't edit or find? <comment279678> @Tetsujin: I want to make it at least a lot harder to enter private browsing. I want to _not_ be able to make a new window with private browsing. <comment314270> This doesn't answer the question about how to disable private browsing in Safari.
