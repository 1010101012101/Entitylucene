Can I underclock/undervolt my 2014 MacBook Pro Retina? <body> Is there any software out there that can do this for i5/i7 processors? Or perhaps editing the config file?  <comment209031> underclock is automatic, just lower the demand. what is undervolt? <comment209318> Both clock speed and voltage adjustments are automatic but i'd like some manual control so I can lower or lock those settings.  *undervolting is the process of setting the voltage lower than the stock voltage.
