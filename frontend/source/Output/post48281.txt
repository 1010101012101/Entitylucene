Does TextWrangler 4 break BBAutoComplete 1.5.3? <body> I just installed TextWrangler 4, and now when I try to use BBAutoComplete version 1.5.3, I get the error message seen below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJ58k.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a workaround to make BBAutoComplete work with TextWrangler 4?  <answer48282> Yes, it breaks version 1.5.3, and yes, there's a workaround. But now it's unnecessary, because version 1.5.4 has been released and it solves the problem.  If for some reason you want to still use 1.5.3, you can do the following:  In the script code~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Scripts/BBAutoComplete/code, there is a function codecanCompleteInWindow(w)/code. This function needs to be modified to work with TextWrangler 4.  Open the script in AppleScript Editor.  As it ships, there is a function in the script that reads  precodeon canCompleteInWindow(w)     tell application "TextWrangler"         return class of w is in {text window, disk browser window}     end tell end canCompleteInWindow /code/pre  Change it so it reads   precodeon canCompleteInWindow(w)     tell application "TextWrangler"         return class of w is in {text window, disk browser window, project window}     end tell end canCompleteInWindow /code/pre  Save the script. BBAutoComplete should now work with TextWrangler 4.  <comment56876> This is addressed in BBAutoComplete 1.5.4, which also includes other improvements to the script. http://c-command.com/blog/2012/04/25/bbautocomplete-1-5-4/ <comment56877> @MichaelTsai Thanks.
