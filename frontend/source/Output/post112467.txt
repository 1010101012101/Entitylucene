How to disable profanity filtering on iOS 7? <body> Recently upgraded from iOS 5 to 7, and noticed that if I receive an email containing a curse word, it's replaced with "(BLOCK)". Any way to disable this behavior and et back my F bombs?  <answer112470> strongiOS does not do profanity filtering in incoming emails/strong like your example.  Such filtering will be done elsewhere, either by the sender's mail server or your mail server, before the email gets to your device.  <comment132055> Are you sure this is caused by iOS? Could be your email provider as well (or the provider on sender side). <comment132249> Mail is from gmail to gmail, and the profanity is visible if I look t the mail on a computer (using gmail web interface).
