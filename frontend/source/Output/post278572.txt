Sync iOS device from terminal <body> Since I work with Xcode and plug in and out iOS devices multiple times per day, I don't want iTunes to automatically backup them every time I plug them in. But at the same time I would like to have a daily backup of the devices.  So I was wondering - is there a way to trigger iOS sync with a terminal command, so then it can be scheduled to run every day?  <answer278580> ol liFind your device Product ID and Vendor ID from System Information.app in the Utilities folder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eTH9a.png" alt=""/li liRun the following  precode/System/L*/Priv*/MobileD*/V*/A/reenumerate_ios_devices vendorid productid /code/pre  Replace ‘vendorid’ with your Vendor ID and ‘productid’ with your Product ID./li /ol  <comment350571> Check [this very old article](https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/16/terminal-tip-syncing-your-iphone-or-ipod-touch-from-the-command/).
