Using built-in apps or command on OS X, is there a way to limit iTunes download and webpage upload speed? <body> There are two situations I found useful to limit download and upload speed on a Mac:  ol liiTunes download of a movie -- I don't want that to use a lot of bandwidth but want maybe 50% or 70% of bandwidth allocated to the download./li liWhen uploading something big on a website, such as uploading a video to YouTube, I don't want the upload to use most of the bandwidth, because when upload speed is used to the max, download speed will become minimal./li /ol  Without using some heavy duty app such as Network Link Conditioner, which is part of Xcode, is there a way just to say, limit all upload to 100kb/s, and all download speed to 1MB/s on a Mac?
