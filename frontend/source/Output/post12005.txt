How do I play a YouTube video in the background on my iPad? <body> I like to 'listen' to YouTube video in the background while I am surfing on my desktop. However, I cannot do this on the iPad as, as soon as I switch from YouTube video to the browser, the video pauses. Is there a solution for this either in the form of an app or a website?  <answer12010> Try the following steps :  1: Start the video from YouTube whilst in Safari.  2: Hit Home key once. You'll exit Safari and playback will stop.  3: Double-tap Home key to bring up the app-switcher. Slide to the right to bring up background audio controls. The icon on the right side will show whichever program you last used with background audio: Safari.  4: Press Play. Youtube audio will resume playback.  <answer40031> One simple solution that I use is to simply convert and download the video to an mp3. Then you can save it and play it back anytime. There is a great new tool that will let you convert and download YouTube videos right from your browser. This is free although you will need to create an account and login to use it.

I assumed it wouldn't work with videos. <comment46983> Welcome to Ask Different!

Nice find.
