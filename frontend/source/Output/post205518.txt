Trying to share a contact group on iPhone? <body> On my laptop, using my iCloud account, I have created a Contact Group for my iPhone.   I'm trying to make it easy to send text announcements to the Football Team.  How do I share or export that Contact Group with another iPhone user?  <answer205546> This doesn't work on Chrome for Mac, so it may be the same on Windows &amp; require that you use a different browser to achieve it...  ul liGo to https://www.icloud.com/#contacts  /li liIn the left column, select your required group  /li liGear menu, bottom left -br Select All, thenbr Export vCard/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IdjXy.png" alt="enter image description here"  The exported file contains all the contact details for that group of contacts.br This can be shared.  Whether that data can then be used to send a single text may be dependent on your carrier.  <comment247791> Select all the contacts and drag them to finder. It will create a .vcf file you can send to others. <comment247793> HI... is "FINDER" on a MAC -- I have an HP Laptop. are you "selecting" all the contacts on icloud or on the iphone? <comment247794> @FOOTBALL MOM Finder is on the Mac, so that solution doesn't apply to you. <comment247795> Please don't use all caps. Sorry, by default I assume you have a Mac. If you have the contacts on your phone, you can just send them to others. If there are a lot (to many to send manually) then you'd have to figure something out. What are you using to sort your contacts on your computer? <comment247796> icloud in Chrome.... <comment247797> How many contacts are there? Are there too many to send one by one? <comment247798> @FOOTBALLMOM IronCraftMan means you go on your iPhone, and separately send all of the contacts in that group to someone. <comment247799> there are 24 contacts -- you cannot send a group text (manually) with more than 10 contacts -- thus making the coach send 3 texts everytime --  by texting the entire team -- in one group -- it would alleviate al that, <comment247800> Wait, are you trying to say you want to text everyone in that group, or send the group's information to other people? <comment247801> I don't believe you can text a group. Why do you need to send the contacts out in the first place? <comment247806> @IronCraftMan do you need a program? "Coach", "team", "FOOTBALL MOM".... Do you really need to ask why?  I get it... Unfortunate football mom, what you want doesn't exist yet.... Apple.con/feedback and suggest it <comment247919> @Tyson I'm not asking why you want to send out the messages, just why you were asking to send out all of the contact cards.
