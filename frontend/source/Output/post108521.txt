install libsoup on macbook pro <body> I have a shell script from a open source project, when I run it in terminal, I get the following error:  precode./configure: line 17678: syntax error near unexpected token `soup,' ./configure: line 17678: `  PKG_CHECK_MODULES(soup, libsoup-2.4)' /code/pre  I googled on ineternet, someone encountered a similar problem, he suggested to install stronglibsoup development package/strong which might fix this problem. Then, I found the libsoup link.   But I am not sure how to install stronglibsoup/strong on my MacBook ? Anyone could help me?  <answer108523> Using macport (see the link for download &amp; installation) :   codesudo port install libsoup/code
