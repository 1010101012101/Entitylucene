Changing OS X behaviour after crash recovery <body> OS X tends to try and help out and reopen everything to just the way it was before it crashed. I mean this in two ways:    ol liIf an app running within OS X crashes, OS X will remember the last working state of the app and resume at that point next time you launch the app.  Example: Safari crashes because I've shamelessly opened way too many tabs and windows again. The next time I launch Safari I tax the system severely and fight to be able close windows or even force quit again./li liIf OS X itself crashes, the computer automatically restarts and loads OS X again, at which point every application, web page, and document that was open at time are simultaneously reloaded./li /ol  How can I prevent or alter the way such situations are handled?  <answer182828> To your first question:  Open System Preference -General settings, and select following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SlvCO.jpg" alt="do not open"  To your second question: (actually we do not like to have more than one question, but since they are related...) that is a Safari settings.
