UPS present check from command line <body> System Preferences in Sierra seems to know when a UPS is present. How do I check this from the command line?  <answer272090> Parsing the output of codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType/code provides a line status codeUPS Installed : Yes | No/code which seems to be flipping with me (un)plugging the USB cable from the UPS.  <answer272091> Use the command codesystem_profiler SPPowerDataType | grep "UPS Installed"/code.  This will return something along the lines of codeUPS Installed: No/code  <answer272093> You can use Power Manager's codepmctl/code tool to check for a connected UPS, see Scripting Batteries and UPS on Mac OS X.  codepmctl/code can output in a range of formats to make scripted parsing easier, use the code-f/code flag for this:  ul liJSON/li liperl/li liXML/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p2Uwf.jpg" alt="Power Manager scripting UPS"  Alternatively, you could search the output of codesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType/code to find the matching UPS.  I wrote Power Manager, so feel free to ask technical questions.  <comment342050> Is this supposed to be part of your question? Perhaps you should edit the question to add this as extra detail and delete this as an answer. <comment342079> No. It's the answer to my question, which I found minutes after posting the question :)
