How to change desktop wallpaper for all virtual desktops? <body> I have six virtual desktops and want to change a desktop wallpaper for all of them at once. There is no such option when using System Preferences, so I have to change a wallpaper only for one desktop and repeat this six times.  Is there any way for process automation?  <answer71072> Set the wallpaper for Desktop 1, delete all other desktops, then recreate them. New desktops created always share Desktop 1â€™s wallpaper.
