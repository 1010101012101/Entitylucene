iPhone 5s internal storage is full <body> When I connect my iPhone to my pc, it shows that the internal storage of the phone is almost full, however when I click the subfolders, there are no photos or videos inside the folders to delete.  How can I delete what I can't find?  <answer148730> If you are talking about using windows explorer to delete files, that would be of no help. Windows Explorer can ONLY see photos and videos. It treats the phone as a camera and can only see such.  Use iTunes to manage the storage of the device. It will even give you a breakdown of whats using the most on the phone.  Alternatively you can go to codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Usage -&gt; Manage Storage/code on the phone itself and delete some stuff from there.
