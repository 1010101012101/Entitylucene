Creating an event from Last Imported in Photos.app <body> How do I make an event from my last import using Photos? Does Photos only use albums rather than events? Is it still possible to merge events?  <answer180637> Photos uses Albums instead of Events and you can create an Album from the last imported by selecting all in the Last Imported album and clicking the strong+/strong icon on the toolbar. Albums are merged by selecting the contents of one, copying it to another, then deleting the first.
