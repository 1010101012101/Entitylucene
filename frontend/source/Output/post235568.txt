Merge partitions with Macintosh HD <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UeN8c.png" alt="diskutil list"   This is my diskutil list.  I wish to merge Misc (disk0s4) with Macintosh HD (disk0s2) leaving only Macintosh HD (disk0s2). Normally I would use this command to merge the two disks:  precodediskutil mergePartitions HFS+ Macintosh HD disk0s2 disk0s4 /code/pre  But, I am not sure whether this command will format my Macintosh HD which I do not want. Misc (disk0s4) is already formatted and thus empty. But Macintosh HD (disk0s2) can not get erased.  Can I securely use the command to merge the two disks?  System information: OS X El Capitan, version 10.11.3  <answer235571> The command codediskutil mergePartitions HFS+ Name disk0sx disk0sy/code will merge strongall/strong disk slices from disk0sx to disk0sy while only data on the first disk partition in the command (i.e. disk0sx) won't be erased. In your case disk0s2, disk0s3 and disk0s4 will be merged into disk0s2. Consequently you will lose your Recover HD partition.  If the volume name contains spaces use quotes: codediskutil mergePartitions HFS+ "Macintosh HD" disk0s2 disk0s4/code.  I never had a problem merging slices like this but it's always beneficial to have a working (Time Machine) backup.  hr  To recreate your Recovery HD after merging it to disk0s2 either reinstall your current system or use a tool like RecoveryPartitionCreator 3.8.  <answer235580> precodediskutil  erasevolume  "Free Space"  ""  /dev/disk0s4 diskutil  resizevolume  /dev/disk0s2  R /code/pre  The first command will remove partition code/dev/disk0s4/code.  The second command will move code/dev/disk0s3/code to the bottom of codedisk0/code while resizing code/dev/disk0s2/code to maximum size.  <comment288152> Okay, I am currently using time machine to make a backup to an external harddrive to make up for the lost recovery disk. After the merge, I assume I can make a new recovery partition?  You reply answered my question completely. Thank you. <comment288153> Would it be possible to change the identifier associated with "Recovery HD"?  That is, if I changed Recovery HD from disk0s3 to disk0s5 the Recovery HD wouldn't be between the two slices disk0s2 and disk0s4. <comment288154> @Emil_S Reinstalling your current system (e.g. 10.11.4) should rebuild the Recovery HD partition without touching your data. Depending on your setup [RecoveryPartitionCreator 3.8](http://musings.silvertooth.us/downloads-2/) may also work.
