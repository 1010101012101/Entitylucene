How to get users hashed password <body> I am playing about with 'John the ripper' to see how easily my password can be cracked. The only issue i I cannot seem to fin the hashed password.  Things I've tried.  ul liReading hash from code/etc/passwd/code - Result: No user found/li licodesudo dscl . -read /Users/&lt;user&gt;/ | grep GeneratedUID | cut -c15-/code codecat /var/db/shadow/hash/&lt;Result From First Command&gt; | cut -c169-216/code - Result: directory 'shadow' does not exist/li liSome others (forgotten what they were. Had similar issues./li /ul  This also didn't work for me.  Would like to know where the password hash is for my user so I can test out JTR.br Thanks in advanced.  bEdit:/bbrbr When I do codesudo defaults read /var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/Test.plist ShadowHashData|tr -dc 0-9a-f|xxd -r -p|plutil -convert xml1 - -o -/code I get 2 hashescode'zcvUSru/AH3YNusqitC14z8dm8iX9dZTRzKKkv+oMODQQ9CG79yGmsjo8s13UCSIZ6TmE/U2krMC7KzxgafDwVkOq0eJ1F6aYFUBex649rUnj/58jhCp7Lgt5vWYN95SrDQwMKEYkFXkHM/Ieg0GsnCJnZwem4ugfSnU2fKCquE=/code and codeweXOBzKgCTzoeamwRXZ8vLNQNrHyCyFk/ZD2Bc/Vb6c=/code However when I put 'Test:' in a text file and do code./john &lt;file&gt;/code It gives me 'No password hashes loaded'.  Is this an issue with how I'm using John The Ripper or am I getting the wrong hashes?  Note: This was a test user and this is not my real password hashed. The encrypted password is 'password'  <comment238477> The [link](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/186893/os-x-10-9-where-are-password-hashes-stored?rq=1) you mentioned worked fine for me on a Yosemite system - I assume you replaced `username` with the correct username for the user in question? <comment238542> @mjturner That doesn't work for me. Look at my edit for more info. <comment238572> Which version of John the Ripper are you running? Not all versions support 10.7 and later salted SHA-512 hashes... See the [documentation](http://www.openwall.com/john/doc/) for more information - you need a **-jumbo** edition. <comment238579> @mjturner What do you mean a jumbo edition? Do you have to pay for it? I will tell you my version when I next get a chance. <comment238633> The **-jumbo** editions are community-supported editions that add additional features. If you check the [list of downloads](http://www.openwall.com/john/) you will see them listed there. No, you don't have to pay for such releases - they're open source.
