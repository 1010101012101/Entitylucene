Go to beginning of text field in Mac. <body> What's the keyboard combination to use to go to the very beginning of a text field?  Tried kbdFn/kbd+kbdUp/kbd and it scrolls the document up but doesn't move the cursor.   <answer55059> kbdCommand/kbd+kbdUp/kbd strongor/strong kbdCommand/kbd+kbdLeft/kbd will take you to the beginning of the text field, while kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDown/kbd strongor/strong kbdCommand/kbd+kbdRight/kbd will take you to the end of it.  <answer55072> Use kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdA/kbd to move to the beginning of the text field, and kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdE/kbd to move to the end. This works in all Cocoa-based apps.  <comment63180> Command+Right won't take you to the beginning of a multi-line text field, but Command+Up will.
