Is it possible to change the birthday format in calender? <body> I’m showing the address book birthday’s in the calendar app but I hate that every thing I can see ist “xx. birthday of N…“ and not mor because the labels are to narrow. To see who’s birthday it is I need to click on the event.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1NRGp.png" alt="calendar"  Is it possible to an other fromat like code&lt;name&gt; (&lt;xx&gt;. Birthday)/code   <answer68857> No, but you can turn off the iCal birthday calendar and download Dates 2 iCal 2 which allows you to sync birthdays (and anniversaries) and customize the text to your preference.  <comment79988> Thanks. Seems to work fine, but other ways are still welcome …
