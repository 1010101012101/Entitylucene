Force iCloud pictures to temporarily save to iPhone <body> I work with an application that loads pictures from iPhones. Unfortunately, many newer iPhones seem to have iCloud enabled and codeOptimize iPhone Storage/code turned on, and my application isn't able to find pictures which are stored in iCloud (my app uses the Camera Roll, as noted in this question). The application is still able to access photos which are stored locally on the device - for example, photos downloaded from e-mail messages are loaded correctly.  I don't have authorization to disable iCloud syncing on these devices, either temporarily or permanently. I also don't want to enable codeDownload and Keep Originals/code as some of these devices have thousands of photos that would need to be redownloaded, and I don't have an available WiFi connection for them to use. Instead, is there a way I can resync specific photos from iCloud to be stored on the device? I have heard just viewing the picture on the device should be enough to force a resync, but from what I've seen so far that isn't the case.
