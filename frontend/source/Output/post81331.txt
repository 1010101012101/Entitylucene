How to convert my music to ringtones for the Iphone 5 <body> I am trying to convert some of my favourite music files to ringtones on my iPhone 5. It has been pretty confusing maneuvering iTunes to do so, so I'm looking for a much easier way to do so.  I connect my iPhone (iOS 6.0.2) to a PC running iTunes 11.0.1.12.  <answer81334> Check out this tutorial, it walks you through it. http://www.gottabemobile.com/2011/10/26/ios-5-how-to-create-custom-ringtones-and-alerts-for-the-iphone/  <answer81340> I use Rogue Amoeba's Fission. It's not cheap, but it's useful for all kinds of audio editing, and it makes ringtones very easily.  <answer81368> GarageBand can do it. Import a song, select a 30-second range, export it as a ringtone.   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1358  Edit:just saw the PC bit.  Haven't tried it, but there's an app:  https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/ringtone-maker-make-free-ringtones/id390929278?mt=8  And a website: www.iringer.net/
