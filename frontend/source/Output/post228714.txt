Blue and white rectangle <body> I just restarted my MacBook Pro and I am now getting a blue and white rectangle near the top right corner of my screen. Does anyone know what this is or what is causing it?  MacBook Pro Retina 15-inch, Late 2013, Version 10.11.3.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o0xa4.png" alt="enter image description here"  After restarting my laptop again, the box was not there immediately, but showed up before everything was fully loaded in a slightly different location.  I am unable to click on the box, and trying to drag it just creates the regular selection box as if nothing is there.  strongUpdate/strong: I ran Apple's diagnostics and it claimed there is nothing wrong with the machine itself.  strongUpdate 2/strong: I attempted to restart my machine into safe mode a couple times but it did not seem to work. It looked like a normal load sequence, just hanging before asking for my login credentials. However, after a regular login, I no longer seem to have this issue. Hopefully it stays this way.  <answer228717> Here's a list of steps to possibly resolve your problem:  ol liReset Finder: This is a basic step, just open up codeForce Quit Applications/code by calling code⌘-⌥-esc/code and then press finder and reset it./li liOpen codeTerminal/code and enter the command codekillall Finder/code. If it goes away then it's a problem with finder. /li liOpen Activity Monitor: If there is anything irregular open in activity monitor just close it. strongHowever/strong, be emvery/em careful with Activity Monitor. It's easy to close something that will crash your machine. /li /ol  <comment278925> Please add your system version. Additionally restart your Mac pressing the Shift key (= Safe Mode) and report the result. <comment278926> You can use "Accessibility Inspector" from Xcode and try to track the App responsible of showing this window (maybe from AXApplication accessibilityLabel). <comment278929> @MateuszSzlosek Accessibility Inspector shows no additional or different information from the desktop itself. <comment278934> Looks like better touch tool to me? <comment278950> You're welcome to post suggestions as answers in most cases. I've edited your answer to remove the "maybe this should be a comment" statement. <comment278951> This rectangle looks like it's from [BetterSnapTool](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12). <comment278952> I have neither BetterSnapTool nor BetterTouchTool. <comment278954> As stated in an update, I'm not currently having this issue. I also had a call with apple support and they had me reset the NVRAM. I'm really not sure what I should do with this question. <comment278955> @JustinWood Booting to Safe Mode wasn't intended to solve your problem. It just stops any non-Apple kernel extension and some start-up items. Ruling out an OS X operating system problem facilitates the search for the real culprit <comment278956> @klanomath I know. I was unable to actually get into safe mode though, so I can't give any information as to whether this was still occurring in safe mode. <comment278957> Thank you! I wasn't 100% sure on the rules as I'm new to Ask Different.
