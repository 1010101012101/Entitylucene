How to navigate iTunes with the Apple IR Remote <body> With the death of Front Row, I need an alternative 10' interface to iTunes.  My IR Remote will let me pause/play the current media, and of course the volume.  But I can't seem to navigate the library with nothing but the IR remote.  I know I can use the Remote software on an Touch / iPad, but it 10x the price of an IR remote, you're kidding right?  <answer18411> You could try an app like Plex. It has a music component and is designed to be operated by a remote.  <answer18423> I just want to tell you that you don't have to miss Front row at least for now, because as far as I know you still can run Front row with Lion by copying these files from your Snow Leopard to Lion  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Front Row.app /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/BackRow.framework /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/iPhotoAccess.framework /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.RemoteUI.plist /Applications/Front Row.app /code/pre  Please refer the following links for more info.  http://www.mac-hatter.com/blog/frontrowenablerforlion  http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/21/how-to-install-front-row-on-lion/  <comment20122> Perhaps I'm mistaken, but Plex looks like an ITunes alternative, which is not what I'm looking for.  I have all my media already tucked away in the iTunes Library, which FrontRow was aware of. <comment20123> @Ralph It can connect to your iTunes library and play stuff from there <comment20136> Apparently not after updating to iTunes 10.4, but thanks. <comment20140> Not an answer, but you could install [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/).
