Using my Time capsule to improve WiFi from my network supplied modem <body> We've recently moved house and now I have a Macbook Pro, a 2009 Time Capsule and an ADSL modem/router from our network supplier, Telstra. The Telstra modem doesn't have enough grunt/range to reach another room for me to use my iPad there. In a previous house we connected the Time Capsule to another type of Telstra modem by Ethernet cable and the Time Capsule acted as router. It sent the signal throughout a two storey house. Can I do the same with this setup and what do I have do on the Macbook to make it all work?  <answer247545> It is certainly possible to set up your Time Capsule as your sole router even when your modem is a router/modem combo.  h2Setup/h2  strongPart 1: setting up the Time Capsule normally/strong  ol liDownload Airport Utility on your Mac (if you already have downloaded it, ensure it's version 5.3 or later)./li liConnect your Telstra modem to the WAN port of your Time Capsule via an Ethernet cable./li liConnect the Time Capsule's power cable to an AC outlet./li liOpen the Airport Utility app on your Mac (search Spotlight for it or go to the codeUtilities/code subfolder of your codeApplications/code folder)./li liThe Time Capsule will have an initial name (such as "Time Capsule fea88c").

It's the how I need. <comment305422> Roger :). I'll post a guide for you tomorrow. <comment305469> Ok, I've posted a detailed guide for you. Please let me know how it works! <comment305550> Fantastic. Thanks. That's sorted the Time Capsule to be the WiFi. Now I have to get stronger WiFi to other rooms through brick walls. The TC is a bit weak. I've been told to get a Powerline that connects Time Capsule and another Wifi device in the other room. I already have a Powerline from modem to Foxtel. <comment305576> Nice. Glad I could help (you can click the checkmark if you think my answer helped you!). Using an extender can be unreliable, especially in a big house with brick walls like you have, and speeds will still drop off between the TC and the extender. Certainly try it, but if it doesn't work too well (there ended up being tons of reliability issues when I did a very similar setup in my apartment), a mesh network would probably help. Though expensive, [Eero](https://eero.com) works amazingly for me (you get 3 boxes and they all wirelessly talk to each other to make a mesh network)!
