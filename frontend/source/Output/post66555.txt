Screensaver greyed out in Mountain Lion <body> Recently upgraded to Mountain Lion, noticed my screensaver has stopped coming on (on mains, my laptop will quite happily sit awake and idling for 4+ hours.   My power saver settings are on 15 minutes to sleep, sharing is disabled on everything, and for some reason my screensaver time has been greyed out - I hadn't noticed that before and was wondering if it had any fundamental causes?  The laptop is a Late 2011 MBP 13, connected to a NAS drive (but not actively, same happens when disconnected). Connected to an external display, no apps in the background.  <comment78335> In addition to no screensaver, it also doesn't sleep? <comment78382> Indeed. It'll just sit idling for hours - I left it doing some FTP operations last night, in the hope that it would sleep on completion - it didn't. <comment78388> @iampearce what is your screensaver currently set to? is it a built in or third party screen saver? <comment78399> Built in, tiled images coming from a folder. I don't have caffeine or anything else like that enabled which would block it, either. <comment78402> Since it doesn't even sleep after 15 minutes of no activity, maybe there is always activity ... something is going on all the time. <comment78503> But the screensaver time option is greyed out. Something is clearly blocking it?
