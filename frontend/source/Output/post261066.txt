Lost partitions during OS X Lion reinstall <body> I have a 2012 mac mini, and I want to reinitialize it.  So I tried to follow the instructions here:  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904  Started up from Internet Recovery, erased the existing partitions and chose Reinstall macOS. During the reinstallation phase, something went wrong, and now I can't see the original partitions anymore. The originals size of the disk was 500gb, but now it seems that the partition on which I was trying to reinstall macOS is completely lost.  If from the Internet Recovery, I try to inspect the partitions, this is what I see:  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list            /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                        *1.4 GB     disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map                         30.7 KB    disk1s1    2:         Apple_Driver_ATAPI                         2.0 KB     disk1s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Mac OS X Base System    1.4 GB     disk1s3 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk2 /dev/disk3    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk3 /dev/disk4    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk4 /dev/disk5    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk5 /dev/disk6    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk6 /dev/disk7    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *6.3 MB     disk7 /dev/disk8    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *2.1 MB     disk8 /dev/disk9    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk9 /dev/disk10    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk10 /dev/disk11    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *524.3 KB   disk11 /dev/disk12    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            untitled               *1.0 MB     disk12 -bash-3.2#  /code/pre  ul liI have no idea of what are the various disk2 to disk12./li liIs there any way that I can restore the missing 500gb partition?/li /ul  <comment326882> disk1 is a expanded basic netboot image - all other disks are temporary RAM disks holding volatile data. Your internal disk should be disk0. I recommend to reboot to Internet Recovery Mode and check if it reappears...
