How to list audio card IDs from terminal <body> I am developing a script which deals with sound recording.  As user potentially can have multiple sound cards attached, I would like to give him/her a chance to select desired one. The software I use for actual recording asks for numeric "Device ID".  Is there any way to retreive list of Device IDs along with soundcards' names from command line (terminal)?  <answer181329> I have found out that typing codesystem_profiler SPAudioDataType -xml/code does the job and lists all necessary information. It is solved :)  <answer244425> codesystem_profiler/code is the tool in mac OS to show hw or sw configuraion.  Get the datatye you want to look for using code--listDataTypes/code.  precode$ system_profiler -listDataTypes | grep Audio SPAudioDataType /code/pre  Then fire the command,   precode$ system_profiler SPAudioDataType Audio:      Intel High Definition Audio:        Audio ID: 128          Headphone:            Connection: Combination Output          Speaker:            Connection: Internal          External Microphone / iPhone Headset:            Connection: Combination Output          Internal Microphone:            Connection: Internal          S/PDIF Optical Digital Audio Output:            Connection: Combination Output          HDMI / DisplayPort Output:            Connection: Display      Devices:          Built-in Microphone:            Default Input Device: Yes           Input Channels: 2           Manufacturer: Apple Inc.
