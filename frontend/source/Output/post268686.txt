How can you print an email in gmail app on iPad <body> How can you print an email using gmail app on iPad  <answer268694> It appears that you can't print from the app on iOS.      Unfortunately, you can no longer print using the Google Cloud Print.   You would have to go to the site and print it from there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AIeHO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment337408> Please check out this [link](http://bfy.tw/9SUg).  I also suggest taking a look at [How do I ask a good question?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) from our [Help Center](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help) <comment337429> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because while it's clear what the OP is asking, it's also clear that the OP didn't do the most basic amount of research on the topic.
