How does one use different languages in Pages headers and footers? <body> [strongEDIT/strong]  I'm afraid this language feature is gone in Pages 5.*  How does one use different languages in Pages headers and footers?br I don't need spell checking but language switching (for headers and footers in an automatic language different from the system language)  Google (and forums) says:br em"Inspector  Text  More  Language"/em and create custom style.  But... I have no "language" tab in emInspector - Text - More/em  When I select text I see:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uzt4h.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  (In OS X/Preferences I already selected multiple languages for spell checking)  System: strongEl Capitan/strongbr Pages: strong5.6.1/strong  <answer222131> Pages 5 can no longer tag text according to language, to have this feature you must go back to using Pages 4.   For spellcheck, you select the dictionary via Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar.  <answer231216> I'm writing in Polish. In Pages version 5.6:  ul liSelect all the text/li liGo to strongEdit  Spelling and Grammar/strong/li liAt the bottom of small window you may select your language./li /ul  Voila!  <answer283081> ul liHighlight the section of page number/li liGo to Document/li liSection/li liFormat/li /ul  Voila!  <comment282327> This answer just duplicates the previous one, and it's not even correct, because you can't see the dictionary unless you go a layer further down than Spelling and Grammar.
