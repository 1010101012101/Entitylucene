Triggers on specifc applications in Keyboard Maestro <body> How can I tell Keyboard Maestro to only enable a given trigger (e.g. a hot key) when a specific application is active?  For example, I would like a specific macro/hotkey that pastes without formatting to only be active when I am editing a document in Word or TextEdit.  <answer119993> ol liCreate a Macro Group (File → New Macro Group or ⌘⇧N)./li liSet the Macro Group to only be available in certain applications:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSdW3.png" width="300" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vgcdg.png" width="250"/li liDrag macros to the macro group./li /ol  <comment290127> Aaaaa, superb, thank you very much.
