IOAccelSurface2 error floods console macOS 10.12 Sierra <body> I have a MB Pro that is locking up afer about 30 minutes. When I open console I find this message but cant figure out what is causing the problem.     fault 12:14:37.463057 -0700 kernel IOReturn   IOAccelSurface2::surface_unlock_options(enum eLockType, uint32_t):   surface is not locked.   <answer260221> I noticed the exact same error popping up if a TeamViewer Session is established. An internet search brings up this discussion.  Propably, its an incompatibility bug for TeamViewer 11 with Sierra.  precodeProblem 10:31:54.180203 +0100   kernel  IOReturn IOAccelSurface2::surface_unlock_options(enum eLockType, uint32_t): surface is not locked.

That solved it for me.  <answer295300> We had a user at our company that was having some performance issues on their Mac. So I connected remotely via Timbuktu and took a look at their console. I noticed a constant flood of similar errors:  fault   11:48:36.982151 -0500   kernel  IOReturn IOAccelSurface2::surface_unlock_options(enum eLockType, uint32_t): surface is not locked.  So I removed TeamViewer but the errors persisted. After spending about an hour trying to resolve the problem I discovered that the console flood was a "red herring". The flood was being triggered by Timbuktu and my remote connection to the computer. As soon as I disconnected the user told me that the console flood stopped.
