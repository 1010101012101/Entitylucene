How do I make the mouse click at current location using AppleScript? <body> So I've been trying to make a program using AppleScript, but there's one thing that's been teasing me for some time now - How do I make the mouse click at current location bwithout using Mouse Keys/b?brbr Also, is it possible to simulate a blong/b click (that means I set the length of it)?  <answer266792> You can simulate a mouse click with AppleScript code like this:  precodetell application "System Events"   click at {123,456} end tell /code/pre  This means to simulate a click of the mouse at coordinate (123,456).  To click at the current location you'll need to first find the current location of the mouse pointer, if you don't know it already. This is not easily done with AppleScript itself, so a neat way is to use the third party tool "MouseTools".  You can download it for free here.  On the download webpage you'll find an AppleScript example for getting the current mouse coordinates.  <answer266852> Wouldn't it be much more convenient to be able to do everything right in script editor?  You should definitely grab the AppleScript toolbox. It has scripting commands to get your mouse location and mouse clicking.  AppleScript Toolbox is a scripting addition/AppleScript-plugin (a.k.a. “OSAX”) providing commands not available in regular AppleScript.  <comment334578> is it capable of long clicking? <comment334580> also, you said it isn't easily done, does that mean it **is** possible w/out MouseTools? it'd be awesome if it worked on other computers which don't have MT downloaded, else I'd have to bundle it w/ my program <comment334581> and one more thing - you seem smart about AppleScript - would you please check out my unanswered questions? I have a feeling you might know the answers - thanks <comment334597> @ProkopHanzl It is both easily done and possible yes. I said it was not easy WITHOUT MouseTools (or similar), but with MouseTools it is very easy. Without MouseTools you would have to find your own solution. <comment334598> @ProkopHanzl Regarding your other, non-related questions - I have no real experience with AppleScript, so you'll have to look elsewhere for answers. <comment334608> OK, thanks for all the help, marking this as a worked-for-me.
