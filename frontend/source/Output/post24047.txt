In Lion's new Mail.app, is it possible to change the font size of the mailbox list? <body> I have a small screen and MANY email mailboxes. I'd like to make the side panel font size smaller, but I can't find an option for it. Is there one?  (I can change the font size in messages and in the message list--that's not what I'm talking about.)  <answer24062> This thread says System Preferences - General controls it.  <answer85934> this was already answered, but you can go to Mail.app  Preferences  Fonts and Colors  Message List font to change this.  <comment27235> Thanks. I don't like the answer (gives you very little control!) but it is something at least...
