"Unable to load the Parallels driver" after upgrade to Lion <body> I have Parallels Desktop 6 (strong6.0.11994/strong) installed and after an upgrade to Lion, whenever I start Parallels, I get these two messages:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUHDj.png" alt="Your virtual machine may run slow because virtualization is disabled on your Mac"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQoZc.png" alt="Unable to load the Parallels driver. Restart your Mac and try again."  Then strongParallels Virtual Machines/strong window appears but neither of them can be started.br How do I fix this?  <answer20031> You don't have the Lion compatible version of Parallels installed! The current version is 6.0.12094.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/laOqn.png" alt="Parallels About Screen"  You can download the latest version from Parallel's download page or use strongCheck for Updates.../strong in strongParallels Desktop/strong menu.  <answer20032> There are several solutions to this problem.    The easiest, and permanent solution is to strongupgrade the Parallels to the latest build/strong.br strongThe upgrade is free for existing version 6 users./strongbr The official KB article says:     Parallels Desktop 6 for Mac (build strong12094 and higher/strong) is compatible with Lion.   To upgrade, go to the download page or click strongCheck for Updates.../strong in strongParallels Desktop/strong menu:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h91cg.png" alt="Check for Updates..."  If you don't yet want to upgrade, you can use a workaround below:  ol liLaunch strongAppleScript Editor/strong (it's in strongUtilities/strong folder)/li liCreate a new file (strongFile  New/strong)/li liCopy and paste this into the editor:     do shell script "for x in prl_hypervisor prl_hid_hook prl_usb_connect prl_netbridge prl_vnic; dobr   sudo kextutil -q \"/Library/Parallels/Parallels Service.app/Contents/Kexts/10.6/$x.kext\"br   done" with administrator privilegesbr   do shell script "open -a \"/Applications/Parallels Desktop.app\"" /li liSelect strongFile  Save/strong, call it strongParallels Desktop Launcher/strong, put it in the strongApplications/strong folder and set type to strongApplication/strong:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jsNZO.png" alt="Parallels Desktop 6 Lion workaround"  The new launcher will appear in your strongApplications/strong folder and you will be able to use it strongto start Parallels/strong. You will need to enter your password once before the start because the script needs administrative privileges.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/045PX.png" alt="Parallels Desktop 6 Lion launcher"  Note that there are also strongother problems/strong with Lion incompatibility in versions prior to 6.0.12094 and this only fixes startup. I also had a problem with Parallels virtual machine window being only briefly visible during Spaces transition, as if it were above all windows in the system. Apparently, I had strongCoherence/strong mode set by default, and there seem to issues with it on the older versions. I fixed the problem by clicking the red Parallels icon in the menu bar and choosing strongExit Coherence/strong:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYTO7.png" alt="Exit Coherence"  To fix the same issue with Parallels configuration window not appearing, I had to change strongAssign to/strong from strongNone/strong to strongAll Desktops/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCBZ5.png" alt="Parallels configuration window is invisible fix"  <comment22121> One question pops into my mind: why would one go this extremely complicated way over installing a free update that solves the issue? Is it the download size? <comment22124> @mwidmann: I edited the answer to reflect that the upgrade is free for the existing v6 users. Personally, I use 3G via my cell operator for the internet connection and I already exceeded the 2GB traffic limit so a temporary workaround helps a huge. <comment22125> Thank you for clarifying! @dan-abramov <comment22875> Some people around do not want to register, and you can't get updates if you don't register. For me the procedure above solved the problem. Many thanks!
