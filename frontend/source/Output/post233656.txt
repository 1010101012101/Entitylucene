How can I turn off iCloud storage space warning notifications? <body> I've been getting many pop-up and email notifications about my meager iCloud storage space (on OS X even though I only really use iCloud with iOS). There's no chance that I'll upgrade so how can I turn off these reminder notifs?   <answer233661> Notifications pop-up when your iCloud is configured for back-up data. You can disable this and have your iPod, iPad or iPhone backed up to your computer instead.  Here:     iCloud automatically backs up your iOS device information daily over   Wi-Fi when your device is turned on, locked, and connected to a power   source.      strongBack up automatically/strong      On your iOS 9 or iOS 8 device: Go to Settings    iCloud  Backup, then turn on iCloud Backup.      On your iOS 7 device: Go to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup, then   turn on iCloud Backup.      strongBack up manually/strong      On your iOS 9 or iOS 8 device: Go to Settings    iCloud  Backup, then tap Back Up Now.      On your iOS 7 device: Go to Settings  iCloud  Storage &amp; Backup, then   tap Back Up Now.      For information about messages that may appear while backing up, see   the Apple Support article Get help backing up your device in iCloud.      Important:   If you don’t back up your iOS device to iCloud for 180   days or more, Apple reserves the right to delete your device’s iCloud   backups. For information, see iCloud Terms and Conditions.   <answer252601> I think your options are limited here.  ol liTurn off iCloud Backup altogether.br Some info on how to selectively or collectively switch off iCloud is here: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2613?locale=en_GB&amp;viewlocale=en_US/li liBack up less, e.g. by deciding not to back up your camera roll.
