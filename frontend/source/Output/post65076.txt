How do I hide a software update? <body> I need to hide a software update in Mountain Lion, so that when I press "update all" this piece of software is skipped.   I followed the directions here but am unable to make it work in Mountain Lion.. no matter if I left or right click with or without any modifier key, I'm unable to bring up the menu to suppress the update.   <comment76424> I can get that to work for 10.8.2, but not for Xcode 4.5. Maybe it is only for system updates?
