Refresh timing of Google Contacts Sync on iOS? <body> I'm working on a CRM (based on web application), using Google Contacts API.  My iPhone’s contacts are linked through my strongGmail/strong account.   I tried to find the refresh timing between my iPhone’s contacts and the Google servers, but I can’t find it.  Does anyone know what it is? Under Settings, it says: emNew data will be pushed to your iPhone from the server strongwhen possible/strong./em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qNqTT.jpg" width="375"  <answer288106> Your Gmail account is setup to use emFetch/em, which you have scheduled codeEvery 30 minutes/code.  Your iPhone will thus sync contacts with your Gmail account every 30 minutes. You may set this to codeEvery 15 minutes/code if you would like more responsiveness. Note that it may then take emup to/em 15 minutes for your contacts to update, although it could happen much faster.   codeNew data will be pushed to your iPhone from the server when possible/code is only an explanation for what emPush/em does, and not a blanket statement for every account you have setup.  As you can see from the list underneath it, only strongiCloud/strong is configured to use emPush/em updates. strongHoliday Calendar/strong and strongGmail/strong are both configured to use emFetch/em, which operates on the schedule you select at the bottom.  The reason for this is iOS simply does not support emPush/em with Gmail. In fact as of iOS 10 you can only use IMAP emPush/em with strongiCloud/strong and strongYahoo/strong accounts. Apple has never explained this limitation, which does not exist on macOS. It is possible there was a partnership between Apple and Yahoo, since Steve Jobs made a big deal out of providing emPush/em email with Yahoo during the iPhone’s original reveal.  However, as of  iOS 11 it appears that any IMAP server that supports IDLE (including strongGmail/strong) will finally work with emPush/em.  <comment363769> Can you explain why is this set to fetch ? <comment363833> Clearer, thanks!
