Moving Folders using iCloud <body> Can I move ENTIRE folders (Pages documents, Numbers spreadsheets, photos) to iCloud, or do I have to move each separately...documents to Pages app, spreadsheets to Numbers app and photos to iPhoto?  I have 10.7.5 OS...can I move entire Folder on new Mountain Lion OS?  Thanks.  <answer65757> This isn't the "supported" procedure, but there's a good chance it will work to move a large number of documents to iCloud.  You still have to move documents kind by kind, but not within particular programs.  In the Finder, select the documents (not a folder; the Pages (for instance) that are emin/em the folder) that you want moved to iCloud.  Select strongCopy/strong from the strongEdit/strong menu.  Press kbd⌘/kbdkbd⇧/kbdkbdG/kbd to Go to Folder.  Type code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code  If the folder codecom~apple~Pages/code exists, double-click it; if not, create it then double-click it.  Select strongPaste/strong from the strongEdit/strong menu.  Repeat for the different kinds of files you want to open in their respective apps via iCloud.
