Can the folder being used by a Finder smart folder, be changed? <body> Smart folders are great, but what if you want to duplicate the criteria used in one, and apply it to a different parent folder?  This is exactly what I'd like to do, but I can't find any way to change the directory being used by the smart folder.  You can change all the various criteria of what to search for, but not the emlocation/em of said search, as far as I can tell.  Is it possible to change the folder being searched in by a smart folder?  If so, how?
