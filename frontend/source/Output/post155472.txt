What's wrong with the Weather widget on OS X 10.10 Yosemite? <body> I have a little problem with the Weather widget in Notification Center in Yosemite. It appears to be missing some of the info from the server.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pj0WB.png" width="284" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7KbK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer171955> With 10.10.2 update this problem fixed.  <comment182904> Where is the app from (I can't see it on my Yosemite machine) <comment182906> It's native in notifications, like on iOS. <comment182907> What info do you think is missing <comment182922> Just update the screenshot above with question signs. Percentage is nonsense, but the missing weather symbol on Friday - is strange, because in Weather Channel site it's normal. <comment182932> On my notifications all fields are filled in (except the one above sunset I think) - does this always happen and is it the same fields? <comment183057> Answer to your question: I add new screenshot above: on the left side the situation today, on the right - after few minutes. All is very strange. Also trying to turn off the geolocation and add town by myself - didn't help, change town to another - the same.
