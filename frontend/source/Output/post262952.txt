nobody user in terminal <body> What's codenobody/code phrase in strongTerminal/strong (and strongiTerm/strong)? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYnPT.png" alt="enter image description here"  It sometimes changes to my Mac name.

This also explains why sometimes you see the name you set yourself.  Check out Why is my host name wrong at the Terminal prompt when connected to a public WiFi network?
