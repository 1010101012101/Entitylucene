Multiplayer between iOS9 and iOS10 <body> ul liOne of my friends, Alice, has an strongiPad 2nd/strong gen with strongiOS9.3.5/strong installed on it. /li liMy other friend, Bob, has an strongiPad 4th/strong gen, recently strongiOS10.0.1/strong installed on it. /li /ul  The Game Center app was removed when Bob upgraded to strongiOS10/strong, and he can't friend Alice or accept her friend request. Alice can't receive the Game Invite Link from Bob because strongiOS9/strong thinks it's an iCloud document, opening it in Safari.  How can Alice and Bob play online multiplayer games (e.g. Super Stickman Golf 2) over the internet together?  <comment315260> What happens when the link loads in Safari? Anything? Based on what I've read, in iOS 10 the invite would appear as a rich message (basically showing that it's Game Center and allowing launching directly), but it sounds like it should degrade gracefully in that in prior versions, you just get a link (something like https://www.icloud.com/share/0pVZ0ltWfeGmc806iDQMQ8w8A) in Messages that once tapped accepts the invite. At that point you might need to launch the game manually. Has that been tried? <comment315771> Bob can try to connect his account on Alice's phone to accept the invite ? <comment315837> @Tubedogg It just comes up as a document that iCloud can't open. <comment315841> @MrMojoRisin Thanks for fixing up the question! They've already tried that; it seems the entire Game Center system is down. Bob thinks it might be an IP block, because Dave's iOS9 device couldn't friend Alice either.
