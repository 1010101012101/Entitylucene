Setting up Lion Server on iMac but can't get remote access to the server via my associated domain name <body> I have been following wegotserved.com tutorial on setting up Lion Server and have hit a wall.  I have static IP address which is associated with my domain name.  When I try to access my domain through any browser I get:  "Forbidden You don't have permission to access / on this server. Apache/2.2.20 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.20 OpenSSL/0.9.8r DAV/2 Server at [my domain name] Port 443"  Web sharing is set up in sys prefs and identifies my domain name (i.e. the server knows who it is meant to be).  Any ideas?  Thanks  Tom  <comment37968> What happens when you visit it locally? Thats a pretty standard apache forbidden page, which can mean anything from the route where you are requesting it doesnt have permissions, to the page you are requesting is not allowed to be accessible to the public. What do you see in /var/log probably under apache2?
