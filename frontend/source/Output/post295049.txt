Don't know Apple ID password, security question and not able to access email! PLEASE HELP! <body> So, I have an IPad and an iPod touch. After getting a smartphone (which was an android) I completely forgot about my Apple devices until I was cleaning and found them. My iPad didn't have a password on it so I'm able to somewhat use it. My iPod had a password that I can't figure out for the life of me. For now I gave up on my iPod. But my iPad keeps asking for my Apple ID and that's where we run into my complicated problem. I don't remember my password,the answer to the security question and it seems the email account that was my Apple ID got deleted. if you know how to get ,y iPad back to normal please, please, please answer in detail below. Thank you in advance.   <comment372407> Please contact Apple Support.
