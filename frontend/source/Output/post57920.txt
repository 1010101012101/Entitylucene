iPhone connect to internet over WiFi using PPPoE <body> Is there a way to connect my iPhone 4S to the Internet with WiFi when the connection is using the PPPoE protocol?  <answer57956> Do you mean emto connect to the wireless router/em itself and get internet access this way?  According to Apple Support Forums,     Generally people will have a router establish the PPPoE connection and then share it with the devices on the local network.   Do you have a computer or another device already connected to the local network? If so, you might be able to share the connection off one of these devices as a separate Wi-Fi connection.  <answer64337> You could try using Connectify to redistribute the computer's connection over WiFi, not sure if it works on OS X though, check it out: google connectify.  <comment67260> I would like the connect to the wireless router and then start connection to the internet using a pppoe username/password. I cannot change the settings of my router as it is blocked by the provider. Sharing the pppoe connection wirelessly from my macbook doesnt seem to work as I cannot share a (wireless) pppoe using the "sharing" part of the settings. <comment75523> Thanks for this tip. Was more looking for a homebrew iphone app to not be needing to use a laptop. This sharing tool might work; havent checked it yet. Question for me can be closed, have new internet connection without pppoe <comment76302> Connectify is, unfortunately, Windows-only.
