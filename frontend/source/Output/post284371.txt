Encrypted USB stick not mountable after canceling password <body> Mac Mini, El Capitan 10.11.6. I have a small USB thumbdrive formatted as "OS X Extended (Journaled, Encrypted)" that I keep connected to my keyboard. When I put the Mac to sleep, the drive gets unmounted and normally asks for the password to re-mount after I wake the Mac. I don't need the drive all the time and re-typing the password gets tedious, so I often cancel the password dialog.  Normally, when I cancel out of the password dialog, the drive is listed as "offline" in the codediskutil list/code output or in Disk Utility, which allows me to mount it manually when I need it.  But I'm encountering situations where this fails, e.g.:   ul liWake, password dialog pops up, with dialog still open I check codediskutil list/code and see the drive listed,  cancel password dialog, codediskutil list/code again, drive has completely vanished, therefore attempts to mount like codediskutil corestorage unlockvolume [drive ID]/code fail./li liWake, password dialog pops up, I actually want to use the drive so enter password, correct password rejected (UI dialog shakes briefly and remains), with dialog still open I check codediskutil list/code and drive does NOT show at all even though the password dialog is still on screen, cancel dialog and as before any attempts to mount fail./li /ul  At this point, I can only unplug and replug the drive. I'd very much like to avoid that; first it's annoying, second I'm worried that frequent replugging will wear out drive and socket. Also, those two cases don't always happen, maybe 30% of the time.  What would cause OS X to completely lose track of the drive? And is there a way to make OS X find the drive again even if it doesn't show up at all under codediskutil list/code? Like a software-simulated un/replug?
