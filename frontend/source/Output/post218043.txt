iPhone app updates stuck with iOS 9 <body> I find that when I click "update all" in my iPhone 4S the downloads seem to start and then when they are completed, it stays stuck once the apps are fully downloaded.  I update through wifi, so it's not due to data restrictions.  The blue circles with the "stop" sign inside stayed like this for more than one hour. In the end I stopped them all and had to start and launch each update manually, which isn't ideal, and what I always end up doing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfrHT.png" alt="enter image description here"  PS: This is iOS 9.1  <answer218045> This was a bug in iOS9 that I thought they addressed in 9.1. Are you up to date?  What used to work for me is like you said, tapping the stop button and re-trying the updates individually.  <comment263563> But the bug is happening on iOS 9.1 in this current situation, my "software is up to date"
