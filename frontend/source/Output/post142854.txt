Print Without Margins in Omnigraffle <body> I have an Omnigraffle canvas sized at the exact size of U.S. letter format (8.5 X 11 in). I want it to print out without any margins, but can't seem to find the correct settings to do so. I have set the canvas size and page setup properly, but the page always prints out with a small margin on all four sides.  <answer142861> Did you set the margins to 0 under the document inspector?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kLGpp.png" alt="document inspector OmniGrafle"  strongEdit:/strong never mind this step, you already had it set under Page Setup     Also, make sure to select borderless by going to strongPaper Handling  select emScale to fit paper size/em  emUS Letter Borderless/em/strong      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qZKRR.png" alt="printer options pane"   <comment168279> Thank you! That resolved my problem by setting the margins in the document inspector.
