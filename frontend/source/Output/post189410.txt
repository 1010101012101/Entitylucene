Bash Terminal Environment variables = dollar sign <body> I think I'm having trouble with environment variables (I'm trying to install seismic unix, the make install doesn't work, and I think that environment variables are the problem). The makefile calls a new directory, $NEWDIR  I established a new directory (mynewdir) and created NEWDIR in my .bash_profile   precodeexport NEWDIR=/Users/me/mynewdir /code/pre  Then checking it:  precodeecho $NEWDIR /Users/me/mynewdir   /code/pre  (this works)  precodecd $NEWDIR -bash: cd: /Users/me/mynewdir: No such file or directory /code/pre  (not working - why?)  precodecd /Users/me/mynewdir /code/pre  (this works! edit: had an $ in front of /Users and this was a typo)  Any ideas?  <comment224616> Are you sure it's `cd $/Users/me/mynewdir` (with the `$`)? <comment224618> There doesn't seem to be a $NEWDIR in the makefile (at least not in the src package I've just downloaded), which error message are you getting on `make install`? <comment224633> Does `cd "$NEWDIR"` work? <comment224859> Thanks for the input.  You have to make a new directory in which you put the package (and source file).  In my case, it's actually called /cwpsu and the pointer is $CWPROOT - I'm just just /mynewdir and $NEWDIR as examples here.  But anyway - I've troubleshot this issue, but the makefile still does not work.  Here's my solution: <comment224861> export NEWDIR = /Users/me/newdir  - does not work (exactly as detailed above) <comment224862> BUT... NEWDIR = /Users/me/newdir .... (new line)....                            export NEWDIR ..... (this DOES work, e.g. cd $NEWDIR now works) .... <comment224863> How do you get the code box to appear in the comments?  Totally not clear in the instructions, and I've tried about 10 permutations. <comment224868> Problem solved - YES - the environment variables WERE a problem, and then (once fixed) the 2nd problem during installation was me hitting return too many times (instead of y for a y/n question) and having the makefile abort.  Thanks all for the comments, cheers. <comment225141> Code boxes are added by putting text between backticks (shift+tilde on a U.S. standard keyboard).  `\`text goes here\``
