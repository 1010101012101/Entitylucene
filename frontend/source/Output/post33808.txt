In Macbook Pro 17", what's the difference between processors? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cow1f.png" alt="enter image description here"  What's the difference between processors here, other than 0.1GHz? Are there actual model numbers given for the processors so I can look them up on Intel's website? I'd like to see the real differences, and information seems sparse on the Apple store page. Is it worth $250 for the difference?   <answer33815> ol li2.5 GHz (2860QM) ul li2.5GHz base clock, 3.6GHz max TurboBoost clock./li li8MB cache./li liBus/core ratio: 25./li /ul/li li2.4 GHz (2760QM)  ul li2.4GHz base clock, 3.5GHz max TurboBoost clock./li li6MB cache./li liBus/core ratio: 24./li /ul/li /ol  You can compare the features side-by-side here.  The actual difference is strong4x0.1 GHz/strong.   The links will tell you that there is strongno difference besides the clock speed, cache and bus/core ratio/strong. Exactly the same specifications for advanced technologies, memory and expansions.  According to this source there is a strong5.2% difference in performance/strong. 7987 vs 7592 with PassMark.  <answer33816> The 2.4 GHz CPU only has 6 MB of L3 cache (in comparison to the 2.5 GHz' 8 MB) in addition to the infinitesimal clock speed increase. Is it worth an additional $250? I would say no, but for those looking to eek out as much speed as possible, perhaps.  I'm not aware of any benchmarks that compared these two processors, but I can't imagine anything above a 2-3% difference, but that is just an educated guess.
