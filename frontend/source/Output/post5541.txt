Why can't i activate facetime on my ipod touch <body> i have a new ipod touch and i am on a wifi connection but whenever i try to use facetime i get this error:  "Can't connect to facetime, please check your network"  <answer5545> i found the answer.  you have to go into:  Settingsbr WIFI and click on your wireless router and change the DNS to 8.8.8.8  <comment5704> You set the DNS to the Google's DNS. It was then probably DNS-related but could also work with other DNS as I think (and I hope) that Google is not the only DNS pointing correctly ro the facetime servers! :)
