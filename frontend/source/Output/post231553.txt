MacBook Air not contacting Wi-Fi with NETGEAR Extender <body> My MacBook Air is not connecting to Wi-Fi through NETGEAR Extender whilst all other device do, such as MacBook Pro, Apple TV and iPad.  I tried to:  ul liDelete all Network configurations from System Preferences./li liReset SMC./li liReset PRAM./li liChange channel on NETGEAR to channel 48./li liDisable password access on NETGEAR./li /ul  MacBook Air OSX 10.8.5 13 inches Ending 2010  Any help please?  <answer231579> Change the authentication method from WPA2 Personal to WPA or WEP. If the Air is older it may not be compatible.  <comment282821> Do you have your router set up to use MAC filtering by chance? <comment283163> Other devices work fine such as a MacBook Pro, iPad, Apple TV, and other devices. <comment283165> I will tryâ€¦ although I even tried to set the connection without password at all ...and all devices work fine whilst the Mac Book Air does not!!! <comment283580> You just have to work through all the possibilities.  If everything else is eliminated then it would point to the Airport card.  But if the Macbook Air works on other networks there would be no point changing this.
