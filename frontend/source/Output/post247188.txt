Add urls to a list via Automator <body> What is the simplest way to append a list of urls with a selected URL when browsing either chrome or safari. I tried to do this with automator and it was easy to achieve by creating a service with a strongWrite Text to File/strong action (from an add on package). But it does not add a new line after each entry. It doesn't even write a space after an entry. So you end up with a file like  precodehttp://example./Ahttp://example.com/Bhttp://example.com/Chttp://example.com/Dhttp://example.com/Ehttp://example.com/F /code/pre  My next attempt to use a strongSplit Text/strong action somehow resulted in 100 new files being created, each containing a single URL. strongcode(&gt;_&lt;)/code/strong    What I'm trying to achieve is:  ul liSelect a URL in the browser's (chrome or safari) address bar/li liRight click the highlighted URL to get to the services menu /li liClick on the created service (we'll call it strongAdd to List/strong)/li liAdd the selected URL to text file in the Home folder followed by a new line./li /ul  The desired output being:     precodehttp://example.com/A http://example.com/B http://example.com/C http://example.com/D http://example.com/E http://example.com/F /code/pre  Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thank you.  <answer247370> This seems like an effective solution. A single Automator strongRun AppleScript/strong action with the following script:   precodeset text item delimiters to linefeed set my_list to "/Users/username/Documents/URL_list.txt" tell application "Google_Chrome" to set new_items to (get the URL of the active tab in window 1) as string do shell script "echo  " &amp; quoted form of new_items &amp; " &gt;&gt;  " &amp; quoted form of my_list  display dialog new_items with title "Added to the list" /code/pre  ul liSave as a service/li liService receives selected strongURLs/strong/li liInput is strongonly URLs/strong (probably doesn't matter)/li liTested and working in both Safari and Google Chrome  ul liIf using Safari change the codeget the URL of the active tab in window 1/code to codeget the URL of the current tab in window 1/code. Just to clarify: use strongcodeactive tab/code/strong for Chrome and use strongcodecurrent tab/code/strong for Safari./li liIf you have several windows and tabs open and want to grab every URL to populate a list: codetell application "Google_Chrome" to set new_items to (get the URL of the tabs in every window) as string/code /li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRApf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment304979> Can you add a screenshot of the Automator workflow you have so far? <comment304990> I should have kept asking the duck before submitting the question. I think I solved it with applescript but I'd be happy to post screen shots of the previous workflow and / or the current applescript solution. <comment304993> Great! Just answer your own question with the solution you've found then, and accept it :-)
