Adding Line Break to Email Body Content of Mail.app Message Generated in AppleScript <body> I'm currently using the below script to send out an email with a specified subject, attachment, and body message:  precodeon run argv     set theSubject to (item 1 of argv)     set theAttachmentFile to (item 2 of argv)     set theContent to (item 3 of argv)      tell application "Mail"          set theAddress to {"test@gmail.com"} -- the receiver          set theSignatureName to "Test" -- the signature name              set msg to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:theSubject, content:theContent, visible:true}          tell msg             repeat with i from 1 to count theAddress                 make new to recipient at end of every to recipient with properties {address:item i of theAddress}             end repeat         end tell         tell msg to make new attachment with properties {file name:theAttachmentFile as alias}          set message signature of msg to signature theSignatureName          send msg     end tell end run /code/pre  I have been executing the script in the Mac Terminal using:  codeosascript /Users/dwm8/Desktop/email.scpt "Test" "dwm8:test.pdf" "Test Message Here"/code  However, I would like to make a small change in regards to the body message of the email I send out. Instead of sending out the message  codeTest Message Here/code  I would like the body of the email to say  codeTest Message Here/code  where I am able to specify where I want a line break. Does anyone know how I can implement this into my existing script? Thanks for the help!  <answer214982> If you interactively type the message, then your shell should allow you to continue a string on a newline, as long as you don't close the quote.  For example, type this and the outgoing message will have three lines.  precodeosascript /Users/dwm8/Desktop/email.scpt "Test" "dwm8:test.pdf" "Test &gt; Message &gt; Here" /code/pre  You can do the same thing in a .sh script,   precode#!/bin/sh osascript /Users/dwm8/Desktop/email.scpt "Test" "dwm8:test.pdf" "Test Message Here" /code/pre  <comment259769> Unfortunately, the message is previously written and is being passed through automatically. Is there any way to, say, replace each space in my string with a line break?
