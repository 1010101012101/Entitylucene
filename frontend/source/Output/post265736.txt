autocompletion in Go To Folder fails on "-" (dash) <body> I would like to fix this weird behavior.  Let's say you have the following dir structure:  precode~/projects/empty » tree . ├── sub-folder └── sub-folder2  2 directories, 0 files /code/pre  If I write codesub-fol/code in strongGo To Folder/strong and then press tab, this is what happens:  img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/a1p4nuijkmyqfh9/ss-2016-12-21T14-41-10.png?dl=0" alt=""  img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/c81dsaf0lvgbtf8/ss-2016-12-21T14-43-08.png?dl=0" alt=""  img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/i5y1yvdxdy1maaq/ss-2016-12-21T14-43-38.png?dl=0" alt=""  I have to manually remove the extra code-sub/code to be able to go to that folder.  I think this only happens when:  ol liYou have two or more directories with dashes and the same prefix./li liYou try to autocomplete after the dash./li /ol
