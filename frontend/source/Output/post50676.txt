OS X Lion mysterious user cron job just does echo "PATH is $PATH" <body> OS X Lion 10.7.3.  Console view of system.log shows log entries for cron jobs defined in my user crontab as expected. Follow this link to view a copy of my user crontab if you want.  I inspected code/usr/local/cron/tab/code as root and the system copy of my crontab is also as expected (the job entries are exactly the same as what I see when I do crontab -e).  Here's my question: every now and again I see a message like this in system.log:  emMay  7 02:36:17 echo mcook[70156]: mcook cron job PATH is /Users/mcook/local/bin:/Users/mcook/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home/bin:.:/Users/mcook/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/X11/bin/em  I am puzzled because I can't find a matching cron tab entry for this. It's my user name, but none of the cron jobs I have in my user cron table just says emecho "PATH is $PATH"/em. The message appears at odd times, but I can't see an obvious pattern: yesterday at 04:23:59, today at 02:36:17 and 02:47:22  Where else can I look to find out where this is coming from? Could the cause be some old data hanging around in some code.plist/code somewhere?  My crontab says "The periodic and atrun jobs have moved to launchd jobs see /System/Library/LaunchDaemons". I checked those and the files in code/etc/periodic/code but I still did not find a possible cause.  Does someone have other suggestions as to where this might come from?  <answer50677> codelaunchd/code holds files in code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code for individual users.  <comment58099> I only have these in ~/Library/LaunchAgents:  com.adobe.ARM.*.plist* com.apple.AddressBook.ScheduledSync.PHXCardDAVSource.*.plist (two) org.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist* <comment58101> I found the answer to my own silly question.  Found the following redundant statement in my own shell script nsu-syslog (part of my weird and wonderful [nsu][1] utility that I run from X nearly every time I start it):  `logger mcook cron job PATH is $PATH`  At one time I tried running that script as a cron job (see the last job, commented out, in my user crontab listing). You can't start an xterm from a cron job, of course.   I'm not advertising, honest. Just having a senior moment.
