Unable to erase, reformat, or repartition USB drive <body> This afternoon I attempted to mount a .iso of Windows 7 to a bootable USB drive. It's about 370GiB, so more than enough to store it. I did the following to get myself into this mess. Note,code/sda/disk2/code is the right disk.  precodemightybee at mightybook.T-mobile.com in [~]    12:06:27 › sudo dd if=/Users/mightybee/Desktop/en_windows_10_multiple_editions_version_1511_x64_dvd_7223712.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m 12:10:21 › diskutil eject /dev/disk2 /code/pre  After that, I was left with a disk that was reformatted to look like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XOBHB.png" alt="diskutil"  The disk is not bootable and doesn't do what I wanted it to do. Furthermore, the disk is actually un-reformattable, unreadable, and practically unusable. When I run eraseDisk, I get this:  precodediskutil eraseDisk FAT32 WINSEVEN /dev/disk2  Unable to begin erase operation: The target disk is too small for this operation (-69771) /code/pre  So my question is this: How do I regain the ability to erase and try another method to write to this disk?  <answer240347> Your command should work if your disk looks something like mine below (note disk1 vs disk2):  precodediskutil list disk1 /dev/disk1 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +1.5 GB     disk1    1:       Microsoft Basic Data WINSEVEN                1.5 GB     disk1s1 /code/pre  I would unmount the disk as opposed to ejecting it next time.  precodediskutil unmountDisk disk2 /code/pre  You can pull the drive and reconnect it and see if a lower level erase is possible.  precodediskutil eraseVolume FAT32 WIN8 /dev/disk2s1 /code/pre  I would expect you to use FAT32 with codeeraseVolume/code as opposed to codeeraseDisk/code so you might need to repartition things first and then try erasing the volume or recreating it.  precodediskutil partitionDisk disk2 1 MBR FAT32 WINSEVEN R /code/pre  After the above command - you should have something similar to the below with the exception of disk2 replacing disk1  precode$ diskutil partitionDisk disk1 1 MBR FAT32 WINSEVEN R Started partitioning on disk1 Unmounting disk Creating the partition map Waiting for the disks to reappear Formatting disk1s1 as MS-DOS (FAT32) with name WINSEVEN 512 bytes per physical sector /dev/rdisk1s1: 2923976 sectors in 365497 FAT32 clusters (4096 bytes/cluster) bps=512 spc=8 res=32 nft=2 mid=0xf8 spt=32 hds=255 hid=2 drv=0x80 bsec=2929726 bspf=2856 rdcl=2 infs=1 bkbs=6 Mounting disk Finished partitioning on disk1 /dev/disk1 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        +1.5 GB     disk1    1:                 DOS_FAT_32 WINSEVEN                1.5 GB     disk1s1 /code/pre  <comment295353> What happens when you click the erase control in the screen capture above? What is the exact command for "eraseDisk" - I'm presuming it's diskutil. <comment295354> Sorry about the cutoff: you're right, the full command for eraseDisk is diskutil. I was using DiskUtility.app just to display some info about the disk. Clicking erase (and using any format) returns an error with 'Name Invalid'. I tried using the FAT32 naming convention of all caps and it still returned that message. <comment330227> Thanks. In case anyone comes searching, if you see "Error creating partition map: The target disk is too small for this operation (-69771)", then you should do `diskutil unmountDisk disk3` first and then it works. Stupid error message.
