MacBook Pro 7,1 (Mid 2010) 13 inch - Random overheat and shutdown, kernel error <body> Was using my laptop (MacBook Pro 13 inch, Mid 2010, macOS Sierra 10.12.3) normally as usual during classes. Before the initial overheat and shutdown, while I was carrying the laptop with the lid open, the laptop's screen went blank, dark without anything on the screen, but the laptop was still powered on. I just performed a forced shutdown, shrugging it off as a random problem.  A while later, after closing the laptop, putting it into sleep, and putting it in a bag, I realized that the laptop was severely overheating and making beeping sounds. I immediately forced a shutdown, and rebooted, and upon boot, got this error message regarding a kernel panic:  precodeAnonymous UUID:       B1B00A1E-40EE-32D5-355E-EFF615C8D15C  Mon Mar  6 09:51:10

unnaturally slowing down, even slower then the usual slowdowns that I have seen. Creating new tabs, launching programs, all lead into the "beachball of death" for a while.  Is this 6~7 year old laptop done for, or is it a fixable problem? If you need more technical information about the laptop, or if I run into any additional issues, I'll keep the post updated.  <answer275364> strong[This answer not final until this sentence removed]/strong  As you probably know, troubleshooting is a process of elimination and can require quite a bit of patience.  The first things I'd do in your situation are reset your NVRAM, reset your SMC, and perhaps try booting in Safe Mode.  strongReset NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). It may be worth you also resetting this. Here’s how to:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  Once you've reset your NVRAM, proceed to reset your SMC as well.  strongReset SMC/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the strongleft/strong side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Once you're booted back in, take a note of how your MBP is running. If the symptoms persist, proceed to boot into Safe Mode.  strongBoot into Safe Mode/strong  Follow these steps boot your MBP into Safe Mode:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice. Also, it will take longer than usual to boot.)/li liTake a note of what happens (i.e. Are you still experiencing the same issues, etc)/li liOnce you've used your Mac long enough to know if it's working any better, exit Safe Mode by restart your Mac as normal./li liAfter booting your Mac normally, take a note again of what happens (i.e. Are you still experiencing the same issues, etc)/li /ol  Let me know how you went and we'll go from there.  strongAs an aside/strong  In your question you ask emIs this 6~7 year old laptop done for, or is it a fixable problem?/em  Time will only tell whether your issue is fixable, but I see you only have 4GB RAM installed, so from the point of view of whether your laptop is emdone/em it certainly has the capacity to be upgraded. In fact, it can support up to 16GB RAM (although only 8GB officially).   Also, your 13" model was not affected by the the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) GPU issues that resulted in a recall by Apple. So, at this stage, I wouldn't give up on your MBP just yet.  <comment346385> I've added an answer as a starting point for troubleshooting your issues. However, could you provide details of how much free space you have on your drive? <comment346395> 143GB is left. Also, from this crash report, can you tell me, or give an estimate, of what actually went wrong with the computer? <comment346400> It's really too early to say with any certainty. However, if both the NVRAM and SMC reset don't resolve it **and** you find that in Safe Mode it seems to work fine/better, then the first thing I'd try is removing Steam. If Safe Mode makes no difference, then we proceed to some hardware testing. On a positive note, having 143GB free is a good thing, especially since you don't really have much RAM. <comment346403> Right, after resetting the NVRAM and SMC, as well as Safe Mode, it seems that the overheating had stopped somewhat, but the severe slowdowns are still here to stay. Dunno if it's just the hardware limitations of my system, but the slowdowns seem even more severe then usual. <comment346434> Never mind, laptop overheats when it's closed, in a bag. Doesn't seem to overheat when it's out and running though. Also think the overheating issues are a bit random, sometimes happening and sometimes not.
