voice reading web pages (news articles) on the iPhone and Mac <body> I am looking for an app or a method to easily read aloud web pages (especially news articles) that I find on the web.  I read possible 20-50 news articles a day and most of them I would just like to listen to being read by an electronic voice.  I have actually had some success using the built in accessibility features of the mac - however I find them clumsy and difficult to use.  Notes how I used to use the accessibility features:  ol liI would make the set the text to voice short cut to #s /li liI would highlight the text by selecting it in the browser/li liI would then #s to start reading the text/li /ol  Problems with this approach:  ol liThere is no easy way to pause the reading of the text/li liThe the select + read is rather cumbersome/li liThere is no way to batch the reads /li liThere is no queue of reads ... like you can't throw stuff conveniently in the the read queue /li /ol  Actually what I am looking for is a getpocket.com equivalent of text-to-speech.  <answer91885> Have you tried the service "Add to iTunes as a spoken track"? You can easily assign a keyboard shortcut to it an then manage the tracks with iTunes.  I found this tutorial on youtube.  <comment107902> The accessibility features you mention are what people usually use for this kind of thing. Can you describe in a bit more detail why you consider them clumsy/difficult and what a "good" solution/UI would look like for you? <comment107908> @patrix, I added notes as you requested.
