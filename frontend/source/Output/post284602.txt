Is there a way to download or save voice recordings from messenger? <body> Is it possible to download or save a voice recording sent via facebook messenger?  I can't find ANY reference on Google or elsewhere as to how to do this. Seems if you record it from iPhone (Messenger app), it must be stored somewhere - I was hoping it would auto-save to Voice Memos app, but no such luck.  <answer284603> You can't do this on your iPhone itself, but you can on messenger.com on a Mac.  ol liOpen messenger.com in Safari and navigate to the voice recording./li liOpen the Web Inspector from the Develop menu (enable from Preferences â†’ Advanced) and choose the Network tab./li liPlay the voice recording./li liA new row will be added to the Network tab. Double-click the file and it will download./li /ol
