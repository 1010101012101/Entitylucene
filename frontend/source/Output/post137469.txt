What's a way to run an automator/bash/applescript command right when a laptop starts charging and right when it stops being charged? <body> I'm trying to automate running a background application only when my laptop is charging to save battery.   So it will launch when I plug the laptop in, and quit when I take it out.  <answer138815> One option is a third party product like the one discussed here or the free SleepWatcher.  Another option is to write a script to query the status using codeioreg/code.
