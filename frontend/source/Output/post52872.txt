iTunes permissions on second drive <body> I upgraded my mac to use an SSD for System and Applications and moved Users to a second HDD. iTunes will not allow me to authorize.   Here are my paths:  precode/Mac/... (System, etc)  /Volumes/Pig/Users/   /Volumes/Pig/Users/arrow   /Volumes/Pig/Users/Shared   /Volumes/Pig/Users/wildcat /code/pre  Currently permissions on Pig are 755 system:wheel on /Pig, /Pig/Users, and /Pig/Users/Shared.  Error on starting iTunes:   precodeYou do not have enough access privileges for this operation /code/pre  Error on authorization attempt:  precodeThere was an error storing your authorization information on this computer.  The required directory was not found or has a permissions error. Correct this permissions problem and try again, or deauthorize this computer if the permissions cannot be changed. /code/pre  This computer was previously authorized. I've deauthorized everything in my account so now we're starting zero. I've also followed the Apple Support Article regarding this issue. http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1277?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  I understand the gist of what's going on here, I'm just not sure how permissions need to be set up on the second HDD to accommodate iTunes.   Thanks~~  <answer53061> Here's the deal w/ iTunes in regards to moving your Users directory to a separate drive or partition; it turns out that the Shared directory emmust/em remain on the system drive. For example, in my context the path should be code/Mac/Users/Shared/code where 'Mac' is my system drive. The other users stay in code/Volumes/Pig/Users/.../code, i.e., arrow and wildcat.  I believe the permissions I listed above are incorrect and they've since been changed to:  /Volumes/Pig - 644 system:admin  /Volumes/Pig/Users - 644 system:admin  /Mac/Users/Shared - 777 arrow:admin  Correcting the permissions to their current settings didn't solve the problem on it's own, moving Shared to the same drive as the iTunes binary did.   <comment60507> Need more information to correctly diagnose what's going on. For example, do you get an error when you try to authorize? Also, how many computers/users have you authorized with that specific Apple ID? <comment60547> I've updated my original question with a bit more detail. Thanks~~
