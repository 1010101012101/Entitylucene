Corrupted photos library on my Mac Book Pro <body> In order to save space on my MacBook Pro, I created a photo library on an external network drive. It's been working fine for about a year until I tried to access the same library from a mac mini, where the mac mini tries to update the library and hung at 5%, so I force-quit the Photos application.  Now, when I come back to my Mac Book Pro and tried to access the same photo library, I got an error which says codeThis is an Unsupported Library: This Library is from a newer version of Photos â€“ Please upgrade the app./code  So, naturally I tried to repair the photo library via command+option when clicking on the Photos app. But while Mac tried to repair it, it tells me this: codePhotos was unable to repair permissions on your library./code  So, I am stuck!  I am still able to see the strongMasters/strong folder via "Show Package Content" on the network drive and see the pictures and videos, and this strongMasters/strong folder uses nearly 314GB on disk.  Is there any other approach to get this Photos app to be able to use my photo library?  If not, can I create a new photo library and then drop my old strongMasters/strong folder to the new photo library?  Please help. Thanks a lot!
