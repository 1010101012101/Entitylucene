How to add a second display (and let it be recognized) on a mac-mini? <body> I have 2 displays that I use on my early 2009 mac mini running Yosemite. Unfortunately only the first display profile (Samsung PL2202W) is shown. This profile has a maximum resolution of 1680 * 1050. The other display (Iiyama PL B2409HDS) is capable of showing higher resolutions (upto 1920 * 1080). But these options are not shown.  How can I add the second screen so that the mac mini recognizes it?  <comment195278> What cables are you using? From Everymac - *This model simultaneously supports 1920x1200 on a DVI or VGA display using the Mini-DVI port and 2560x1600 on a dual-link DVI display using the Mini DisplayPort (with an optional Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter). <comment195279> Which port did you connect the Iiyama to? Does the Iiyama show the full range of available resolutions if you connect to the other display connector?
