How can I disable the notifications prompt in Safari? <body> Safari for Mavericks has a website notifications feature allowing sites to send push notifications.  I never want to be prompted for this.  How can I disable the prompt for all websites, forever?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttOrE.png" alt="Safari 7 websites notification prompt"  <answer106447> Go to strongSystem Preferences  Notifications  Safari/strong, and then disable it from there. This will disable notifications for Safari, but I don't know if the prompt will stop. You have some more settings in Safari itself, but that's more management.  <answer106563> There seems to be no way to do it. I am thinking of using a plugin to block this code from running. It seems to be related to window.safari.pushNotification.permission in source code.   <answer114493> strongUpdate:/strong Since the release of Safari 7.0.3 Apple finally gives us an option to turn off safari notification prompts. Yeah ! To disable safari notifications go to Preferences within Safari. Click the notifications tab and uncheck "Allow websites to ask for permission to send push notifications". And voilà.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JR8dX.png" alt="disabling safari notification prompt"  strongUpdate end./strong  strongThe explanation below is only valid for versions of Safari before 7.0.3/strong  Apple obviously forgot the option to disable the notification thing in Safari altogether. Anyway this works, but is not for the faint of heart.  pre Stop Safari Open Terminal cd ~/Library/Safari chmod 000 RemoteNotifications/ /pre  That's it.  The chmod 000 just makes the directory RemoteNotifications inaccessible. To make it accessible again (and to re-enable notifications in Safari) just do the above again but use 755 instead of 000 in the chmod command.  I just figured it out, so please be welcome to try it out yourself. Please don't blame me if your OS explodes in your face. Which will probably not happen.  strongUpdate:/strong As lined out in Renés comment below, it is also possible to change the access rights via Finder.  <answer120720> I tried everything but finally got this  this is amazing and it worked http://forums.adobe.com/message/5791174  <answer125718> The proposed answer of chmod 000 RemoteNotifications does work, but unfortunately console is spewed with many failed attempts to access files in the directory.  The messages are all being logged by a process called SafariNotificationAgent which appears to be the single source of grief.  This process can be stopped entirely using:   precodelaunchctl remove com.apple.SafariNotificationAgent /code/pre  OS updates might turn this back on, but I'd rather it not even be wasting system resources trying to access a folder for a feature that I never wanted in the first place.  <answer129011> precodedefaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari CanPromptForPushNotifications -boolean NO /code/pre  <answer174040> To add on to existing answers:  Maybe after some time the second part of the accepted answer is outdated. It didn't stop the process. I had to go to activity monitor to find the process in the file system.   So I ended doing   precodesudo tcsh chmod 000 /usr/libexec/SafariNotificationAgent /code/pre  Works perfectly so far. The process doesn't run anymore when I restart Safari.  <comment125347> This didn't address my question. <comment135996> It is possible. See my answer. <comment135997> I'm now using this for quite some time. So far no problems. <comment137214> This works. I didn't use the `chmod` command though, but went to the `RemoteNotifications` folder with Finder, opened the folder info (⌘-I), and changed the permissions of my own username to `Read only`. No more prompts and the notifications pane in Safari settings remains empty. Perfect. <comment141674> Have you tried my proposed solution ? <comment147701> The linked forum page does not answer the original question. <comment151034> @itsafire Rather than simply stating a post is wrong, explaining _how_ it's wrong or confusing often helps others more than the simple vote. What you did was fine, but just as the post itself is too brief, your comment would work better if more detailed. <comment151116> thanks @bmike: The forum page is addressing a problem concerning the installation of an Adobe product which fails because the process 'safarinotification' is running. <comment325093> This does not answer the original question at all.
