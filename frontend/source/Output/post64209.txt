Where have the folders from public.me.com been moved to? <body> Has the content that people made publicly accessible at http://public.me.com/ been moved somewhere, so that it can be accessed from the web?  Can the content still be accessed with WebDAV as before?  <answer64212> Apple has terminated all Mobile Me services in Summer 2012, data stored on Mobile Me servers has been deleted in the meantime (or at least is not accessible any more).  There was an initiative to archive public content, you may find what you are looking for there.
