How can I remove duplicated items in the install updates list? <body> I just tried to install the OS X 10.10.3 update from the App Store. My internet is slow and after several hours, it finally finished.  It asked to restart, and I accepted.  But nothing happened.  I clicked the "Update" button again, and told it to restart several times, to no avail.  After a few tries, it started the strongwhole download again!!!!/strong  I cancelled it (I'll have to try again tomorrow), but now my Installed Updates list shows this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6dD8e.png" alt="Repeated updates listed" And I don't know how to remove all the duplicate entries... or just a good installation of the update!! This is my first Mac, and is a serious negative experience for me... Other OS beta releases aren't this bad!! Any idea on how I can fix it?  strongEDIT:/strong I was able to install the update with the combo updater, but the repeated updates are still appearing.  Does anyone have any idea what file I can edit to get it listed only once?  <answer180319> Something, somewhere, didn't register correctly.  Possibly someone maybe able to figure out exactly which receipt or App Store file to find, however, it would be far simpler &amp; possibly safer to just get the standalone OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 Combo Updater &amp; run it again; because you don't know what else didn't happen as planned either &amp; the Combo will make sure everything since 10.10.0 is correctly updated.  You can use a download manager to fetch it, too &amp; it will then be resumable if the download halts for any reason.br - examples at Download Manager for Mac OS X [though Speed Download, arguably the best, is discontinued.]  <comment214246> I'm downloading the Combo Updater. Thanks for your answer!! We'll see how it goes :) <comment214248> Wish you luck :) <comment290628> The combo updater installed the update correctly, and the duplicate updates eventually went away as newer updates pushed them down.
