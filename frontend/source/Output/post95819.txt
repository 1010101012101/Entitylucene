MBP Lock screen hotkey without sleeping? <body> I'd like to press a key combo to get my computer to the lock screen. In Windows the shortcut was Windows key + L. On Mac I press CMD+ALT+Power which turns the laptop off and puts it into sleep. I want to just have it go to the lock screen with the monitor staying on.   <answer95824> First, you should enable requiring the password when the screen saver or display sleep begins.  To do that go to   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hLID.png" alt="screenshot of Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General"  Now, when you press the key combination kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdpower/kbd (kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd⏏/kbd on some systems) to put the screen to sleep, it will also lock the screen.  <answer95869> You can add the Lock Screen to your Menubar.  ul liIn Spotlight (kbd⌘/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd) search for codeKeychain Access/code/li liOpen Preferences (kbd⌘/kbd + kbd,/kbd)/li liCheck codeShow keychain status in menu bar/code This will show a lock in your Menu Bar with an option codeLock Screen/code  (Optional) /li licodeSystem Preferences/code  codeKeyboard/code  codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code or codeKeyboard/code Tab/li liIn the codeApp Shortcuts/code or codeApplication Shortcuts/code section, add a new item for codeAll Applications/code with the Menu Title of codeLock Screen/code and a Keyboard shortcut that you like. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXWWn.png" alt="Example"/li /ul  This way you don't have to change your Screensaver timeout and you can lock your machine much like you do in windows. Note that You may also need to Logout and back in for any changes to the shortcut to take effect.  <answer95875> I use BetterTouchTool to do just this. Once downloaded and running:  ul liClick the "Keyboard" tab and select "Global" in the left-hand "Select Application" pane/li liClick "+ Add new keyboard shortcut" at the bottom of the shortcut list/li liClick the "Keyboard shortcut" recording field and hold down the keys you wish to use for the shortcut, I use KBD⌘/KBD + KBDL/KBD (which feels most like the Windows key + L on Windows systems)/li liClick the "Trigger predefined action" dropdown and select "Open application/file/script..."/li liNavigate to /System/Library/Frameworks/Screensaver.framework/Versions/A/Resources and select "ScreenSaverEngine.app" and click "Open"/li /ul  Now hitting KBD⌘/KBD + KBDL/KBD will trigger the screensaver (and lock the computer, provided you followed the advice in the answer from @Buscar 웃 above to require the password when the screen saver or display sleep begins). You can also set BetterTouchTool to launch when the computer starts so your hotkey always works.  <answer95989> Quoting myself from https://github.com/tjluoma/lockscreen:  ol liDownload and install FastScripts (which is free for up to 10 keyboard shortcuts)/li liDownload and install LockScreen.scpt and save it to ~/Library/Scripts/ (you may have to create that folder if you haven't used it before./li liAssign the keyboard shortcut of your choice to codeLockScreen.scpt/code within FastScripts preferences:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gsWJp.jpg" alt="FastScripts preferences screenshot"  Note: while the OP did not want to sleep the screen display, that can easily be done too. Just download Sleep Display and install it to /Applications/ and use SleepAndLockScreen.scpt instead of codeLockScreen.scpt/code.  <answer95995> Logging out to the fast user switching screen:  ul liAdd a shell alias or a keyboard shortcut for code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend/code./li liEnable the fast user switching menu from the Users &amp; Groups preference pane, and then select Login Window… from the menu./li liUse the lock action in Alfred./li /ul  Locking the screen:  ul liCheck "Require password immediately after sleep or screen saver begins" in the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane. You can then lock the computer manually by pressing control-shift-eject to turn off displays, by pressing option-command-eject to go to sleep, or by running codeopen -a ScreenSaverEngine/code./li liEnable the Keychain menu extra in the preferences of Keychain Access, and then select Lock Screen from the menu./li /ul  <answer196191> There is a wonderful tool Karabiner that can help you with this (and many more):  Properties-Misc&amp;Uninstall - private.xml  precode&lt;root&gt; &lt;!-- Place this file to ~/Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml --&gt;   &lt;item&gt;       &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Screensaver Lock screen (Ctrl-Cmd-L)&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;myconfig.lock&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::L, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L,                                 KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_APP_ScreenSaverEngine&lt;/autogen&gt;       &lt;/item&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then activate the codeScreensaver Lock screen (Ctrl-Cmd-L)/code in the codeChange Key/code screen.  <answer238122> I have finally figured out how to do this:  precodepmset displaysleepnow /code/pre  That will actually put the display to sleep without suspending the entire machine.  Amazing how hard it is to figure out how to do something so basic.  <comment112460> I think [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64/is-there-a-quick-way-to-lock-my-mac) might help. <comment112643> Yeah, I don't want it blacking my screen and keyboard out. I thought I made that clear in the OP. <comment247159> A small addition for Yosemite. To add the keyboard shortcut as in the second half of hoss' answer go to `System Preferences` - `Keyboard` - `Shortcuts`, click on `App Shortcuts` - `All Applications` and then add the keyboard shortcut as above. <comment247248> Thanks, I have updated the answer to include the language change between versions. <comment252883> A slight typing mistake .."Show Status in Menu Bar" should be "Show keychain status in menu bar". <comment252944> Depends on the version of the OS, apple likes to change the language slightly between releases. However you are right, starting from at least 10.9 it was changed to 'Show keychain status in menu bar' <comment268970> Another option that I use is the free quick launcher Alfred (free), which includes a Lock command. https://www.alfredapp.com/ <comment291946> Finally, thank you very much. <comment292264> @eveo this is the same as control+shift+eject. Display sleep, but not computer sleep. <comment344917> Mac OS X seems to have different ways of doing everything, which is kind of frustrating. I want to like it, but one of the huge benefits of Windows is having common APIs for many different types of operations (eg. WMI, performance metrics, etc.). <comment347548> Is there an equivalent for the MacBook (which doesn't have an eject key)? On my Sierra 10.12.3, the Ctrl+Shift+Power shortcut puts the laptop to sleep. I see that because the VPN gets disconnected. This doesn't happen for "pmset displaysleepnow". <comment355664> Also, to make it so you can run this with a keystroke, use Automator to create a service. I did something like this https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/03/howto-build-mac-os-x-services-with-automator-and-shell-scripting/ Once you have that you can give it a shortcut in the Keyboard settings. And totally non-intuitive, of course. I've had to reconfigure my macbook twice and each time I had to go google this up again.
