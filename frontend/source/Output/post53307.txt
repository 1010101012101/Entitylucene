Subscribe to RSS feed in Mail app (iOS 5.1.1) <body> In Lion's Mail app, I can subscribe to RSS feeds and have them show up in the inbox.  Can I do the same with the Mail app in iOS 5.1.1?  <answer53308> No, the iOS mail app does not double as an RSS reader. Fortunately, however, there are many great RSS apps in the app store, my personal favorite is Reeder (iPhone, iPad).  <comment60948> Pity.  Thanks for the answer. <comment60965> just curious, do you genuinely like using Mail.app as your RSS reader? <comment60983> Yep.  Why run a separate app?  Mail's already open. <comment60986> Fair enough. I run Sparrow (both on iOS and OSX) for mail and Reeder for RSS. I like single purpose software.
