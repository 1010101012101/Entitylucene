How do I move my IPhone backup from one machine to another? <body> I used to sync my IPhone to my Macbook air using ITunes. All my Apps and other stuff like music and podcast were fully backed up there.  Recently I bought a new mac mini and now I want to create a full backup of my Iphone there. However after, authorizing and fully syncing I noticed that only recently installed Apps were showing up.   How can I get a full backup on the Mac Mini like how I used to have in my Macbook air ?  P/S - I do not backup my Apps on ICloud. Thanks.  <answer211966> Find device backups in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/  strongTo locate a specific backup:/strong  ol liGo to iTunes  Preferences. /li liClick Devices. /li liControl-click the backup you want and select Show in Finder./li /ol  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204215  hr  strongHow to back up your devices using iCloud or iTunes/strong  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977
