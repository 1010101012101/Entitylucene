How to clean install Mac OS X on an iMac G5 with new HDD? <body> I have bought an old iMac G5 (A1145, iSight 20") from a friend and there was no OS installed on it. So now I want to make a clean/new OS X installation. I created an install USB (with Tiger 10.4.6) and boot from it. The Installer went well but there was no HDD to select at [Select a Destination] screen. So I opened Disk Utility (DU) to see what happened and found that DU did not recognize my HDD instantly, I had to wait about 10 minutes or more and finally DU can see it. I tried to erase the disk but it took so long to operate and showed the error message "Disk erase failed: operation timed out". I guessed that the HDD may get damaged so I bought a new SATA HDD (Seagate, 160GB, 7200rpm) and replaced it with the old one. Try to boot from USB again and now it stuck at the grey screen with the Apple logo (no spinning icon).   strongUpdate/strong: Try to replace the new HDD by the old one again and I can boot into the Installer, but there still no HDD to select either in [Select a Destination] or [Disk Utility].  I have 4 Tiger Install CDs (10.4.11, copied, not original) and have it installed successfully on my iMac G4. But when I try to boot from these CDs on the G5 it just stuck at the gray screen with  icon and the spinning icon.  Now here's what I want:  ul liinstall OS X Tiger (or Leopard) on 20" iMac G5/li /ul  What I already have:  ul lian iMac G4 runs Tiger 10.4/li lia 17" iMac G5 runs Tiger 10.4/li lian Intel Macbook run 10.6/li lia Firewire-FireWire cable/li li4 Tiger Install CDs/li lian 8GB USB 3 stick with Tiger Installer/li /ul  Is there anyway to clone MacOS from the iMac G4/G5-17" to the iMacG5-20"? I've heard somewhere about install MacOS to an iMac by booting from a Firewire Disk, but I dont have a one. Can I boot my iMacG5 using G4's CDs or 17"G5's USB via FireWire cable? Please help!  My appreciate! Thanks for your time!  <answer296283> It depends on what install medium you mean with "Tiger". 10.4.2 itself is likely not compatible in its stock version. 10.4.2 shipped with the machine might have special "enablers"  or drivers to make them viable. You'd have to source an install CD for the actual machine to go that 'original' route.  Tiger 10.4.3 is then the first stock version able to run as is. Any later version of the installer CDs up to Leopard  10.5.8 should boot without issues.  Therefore any version of PPC Tiger 10.4.3 up to Leopard 10.5.8 installed on another machine should be clonable to the G5 iMac.   You can also boot one machine from the other machine via Firewire-cable: Using FireWire to connect the other drives is the fastest method to do that. If another Mac with Firewire is available (your G4) then you do not need an external drive. You can boot your source Mac normally and start the destination iMac in Target Disk Mode (just press code&lt;t&gt;/code on boot).   Connect normally booting G4 as source via FireWire to destination G5 powered off. Then boot G5 in Target Disk Mode. Disk Utility on the G4 should now see the G5's internal drive as an external disk.  Target Disk Mode works the other way around: first power on G4 while holding code&lt;t&gt;/code, when the Firewire symbol appears connect the Firewire cable to the G5. Power on the G5 holding code&lt;Opt&gt;/code. You should then be able to select the G4 as the startup drive for you G5 and boot from there.   Nobody except the seller can know for sure in what condition the original HDD was/is. But since you already replaced it and swapped the drives around: This is a difficult procedure on these machines. Damaging something in there seems not unlikely. But if the drives are viable in other machines it would be time to do two things: Check if the iMac boots a full system over Firewire. That might give you already a quite usable machine. Try this either via external disk or with Target Disk Mode. This is to rule out any surprises that may have been introduced by using the USB boot hack via OpenFirmware. Check the hard drive cable. That may have gone bad and then would need a replacement.  Since you already went into OpenFirmware: resetting PRAM/NVRAM might be worth trying.   Booting an Apple Hardware Test or Debian GNU Linux PPC CD (latest Jessie iso) might give you more detailed info on the perhaps now questionable hardware.   If the above suggestions do not work for you: The most common hardware failures related to your symptoms are bad connections on the cables, bad cables or capacitors that did not age well. Cable and capacitors are cheap. But quite nasty to replace in this machine.  <comment374203> Minimum OS is 10.4.2 [max 10.5.8] - what's on your CDs? I very much doubt you'll get it to boot from a USB, btw - that's hard enough to do on the early Intels. <comment374205> @Tetsujin : Actually, I can get it boot from a USB (via open firmware). <comment374206> Ah - I've no experience with open firmware at all. <comment374214> Thanks for your answer. I've updated my question. I can boot into the Installer (from USB) with the old HDD plugged in, but Disk Utility doesn't see it. Try to install the new HDD, the Installer stuck at the screen with Apple logo and do nothing. <comment374222> What's the model of the HDD you used to replace the dead one?  The G5 uses SATA I, but drives should be backward compatatible.  Also, try FreeBSD to see if it's a OS X issue.  [I did it on an XServe](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/43560/install-linux-on-ppc-mac-no-cd-drive/260810#260810) so the procedure should be the same <comment374237> Currently this question evolved into 'how to get into the installation process'. / Troubleshoot the drive being not recognized. A 'clean install' is currently not the next step.
