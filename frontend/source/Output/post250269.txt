What is OBS iPod Touch <body> Today I found an old iPod Touch and it seems like something is wrong with it so I boot it into recovery mode and try to restore it with iTunes. But there are something wrong and I have to manually restore it with the IPSW file. Now I am at ipsw.me and stuck while trying to identify what device this is. I went to checkcoverage.apple.com and enter my iPod Touch's serial number. It tells me it is OBS iPod Touch. Here's the result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p8w9i.png" alt="Check coverage result"  Here's a picture of the iPod Touch if it helps:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z9juN.jpg" alt="iPod Touch"  <comment310689> "Obsolete", which I guess isn't really that helpful :/ iTunes ought to be able to find the correct ipsw for it, btw. & telling us what the "something wrong" is may help too. <comment310732> @Tetsujin Good guess:) This iPod can only boot to recovery. When I plug it into iTunes, it just says iPod. I think it is attempting to download iOS 3.1.3 but it can't. <comment310742> well, only Touch whose last iOS is 3.1.3 is the original, 1st gen, so that might narrow it down a bit ;-) <comment310819> @Tetsujin OK, thanks
