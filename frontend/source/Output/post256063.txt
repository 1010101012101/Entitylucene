Problem with cmd + tab now that I've loaded macOS Sierra <body> Loaded macOS Sierra this morning. Now, once VMWare is running, cmd+tab switches me back to the mac environment but system immediately and automatically switches me back to vm. Result? Can't access mac environment when vm is running. Help?  <answer256066> Apparently, Sierra set the keyboard preference to a loop. Turned that off and everything worked as usual. (Detailed path: system preferenceskeyboardshortcutsinput sources) Both boxes were checked. I unchecked both.   <answer263237> Force quit Dock from Activity Monitor. Dock automatically restarts, and Cmnd+Tab should now work. Some glitch with Dock, it seems. Worked for me.
