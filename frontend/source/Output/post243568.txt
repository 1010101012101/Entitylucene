Apple Trackpad Causing Long Keypress Events <body> In the last day my Apple Magic Trackpad has started to cause long keypress events when I type on the keyboard.  For example, pressing 'a' in a browser menu bar will cause the accent popup to appear. Pressing 'cmd+t' will cause emmultiple/em tabs to open, and causes the 'File' menu to noticeably flicker as if being selected.  This even happens on the login screen. It is impossible to for to log in if trackpad is enabled, since each keypress produces multiple entries in my password.  Is anyone familiar with this situation and a potential fix?  <answer280208> I have the same issue - still not managed to find a fix - I only noticed by chance when the keyboard issue went away if I disconnected the magic trackpad.  <comment299975> The only time I've heard of similar issues is when the battery is going bad and swelling.  The battery sits under the trackpad and when it swells it causes trackpad problems. <comment299978> This is the older trackpad, with removable batteries. I've replaced them already and the problem persists. Previous batters had no visible damage. This certainly is odd - it seems very counter that the trackpad would be reproducing keyboard events. <comment352404> Welcome to Ask Different.
