Speak screen saying "one dollar?" <body> Every few sentences, the phone speaks a phrase that sounds like "one dollar." It's not in the text of the screen. Anyone know what this is?  This also happens on the Uber driver app when it’s speaking instructions. It’s the weirdest thing. It happens on multiple web sites (not just Uber.com), though not all.  I was thinking maybe it has something to do with HTML tags ???  I also found this question:  say command says wrong text (for some voices) and am not sure if it's related. I don't have special voices installed on my phone. I'm just using the female voice.     strongListen here:/strong      https://soundcloud.com/user-339437908/one-dollar#t=0:04      Recorded from https://www.uber.com/a/drive-pp/?exp=nyc      Note that the phrase "one dollar" is spoken quite a few times throughout the recording and those words do not appear anywhere in the   text.   strongOr/strong     strongTest it out yourself:/strong      Go to SettingsGeneralAccessibilitySpeech and enable "Speak Screen".   Then try it here: https://www.uber.com/a/drive-pp/?exp=nyc   hr  ** strongEdit:/strong **  I was digging around and I noticed I was using the "female voice" setting under Siri, but the Accessibility settings have options for multiple voices. Using some of the other voices, the extra words were not spoken, making this question very much related to the linked question. However, the linked question refers to a specific word being spoken as a different word. I am concerned with why this extra phrase is being inserted into the text. The bounty remains and I hope someone can answer. And until then I'll be using the Australian voices because they don't exhibit this behavior.  <answer290993> I can't really get the code of the web page/app, but checking older/similar JavaScript/PHP code of uber.com it seems to be a hick-up of the Text-to-Speech framework which probably stumbles over a snippet similar to code..."common.step-to-main-content":"Skip to $1".../code with $1 being a positional or a formal parameter with the "value": emmain_content/em or emmain content/em.  The above code (without $1 but with emmain content/em) can be found in uber.com/drive/new-york/ (Google Cache).  hr  I'm no coder so I might use the wrong terms...  <answer293578> h2Resolved/h2  This was a strongbug/strong in strongiOS 11 beta/strong 3 (and possibly 1 and 2). It was reported as happening in other apps on phones running the beta.  This post reports it as a bug with AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.  strongAs of beta 4, this seems to have been corrected/strong. If you are still experiencing this issue, upgrade to latest beta.  <comment366866> Welcome to Ask Different! Do you happen to have a recording of it that you can share? <comment366867> @Glorfindel I can make one. How do I share it? <comment366868> Some sites on the Stack Exchange network have a semi-built-in option for this: https://video.meta.stackexchange.com/a/176/17390. So uploading to SoundCloud and posting the link here is the best option. <comment366870> @Glorfindel thx, I will try later on today <comment366879> Adding an URL to a page showing this behavior would also be helpful <comment366880> @patrix Yes, added <comment367283> This is "Skip to $1..."  and $1 is a [formal parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments). <comment367284> @klanomath Interesting. What does it mean and why is it adding it to the spoken words? <comment367286> @Shades It's probably in the PHP code and works as a placeholder: [What do $1 and $2 mean?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15754611/what-do-1-and-2-mean). I don't have access to the US-site right now - I'm always redirected to the German site - and can't really prove it. I will use a US-VPN access later today and check this. <comment367287> This also happens in [Carrot Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-talking-forecast-robot/id961390574?mt=8) <comment367370> I’m pretty sure the word “skip” is part of the menu. If you listen to the entire recording, the phrase “one dollar” is spoken multiple times without the word “skip.” I like the line of thinking here though <comment367372> @Shades All the text spoken *near* $1 in your soundcloud example can be found in the Google Cache link. The other occurrences of $1 are probably related to a/the user name. Checking the surrounding code it isn't as obvious though. I may be wrong the value of $1 in my answer though... <comment367377> Yes, it does in fact look like there are parameters embedded into the HTML as was my original thinking. There is ${parameter} all over the place. <comment367378> +1 while I do more research on this
