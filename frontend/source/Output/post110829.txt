Command Line Tips and Tricks <body> == strongWhat are the most useful Unix shell "one-liners" that you use?/strong &lt;&lt;==  Here are a couple of mine to get the conversation started:  h21. Repeat the previous command with a substring replacement:/h2  emSyntax/em:  precode^before^after^ /code/pre  emExample/em:  You entered:  precodegit clonr https://unbelievablylongurl.org/projectdirectory/evenmoreprojects/project.git /code/pre  Use this:  precode^clonr^clone^ /code/pre  And your command will be re-run with the replaced substring:  precodegit clone http://unbelievablylongurl.org/projectdirectory/evenmoreprojects/project.git /code/pre  h22. Repeat the previous command with an additional string/character/h2  emShell Idiom/em:  precode!! /code/pre  emExample/em:  You ran a command that requires superuser privileges on your box.  Re-run the command without retyping it like this:  precodesudo !! /code/pre  <comment130475> You're about four years late to this... Welcome to the site. I would encourage you to ask about 10 very specific questions with a problem you are trying to solve before attempting a "survey question". The community is peculiar about which they embrace and which they extinguish with great rapidity even where there isn't a duplicate. <comment130476> I have unprotected the linked question so you can add your examples here as answers if they aren't already covered. <comment130478> Excellent, thank much for your responses.  My apologies for the duplication of the previous question.  I read through the responses to the question there and it seemed that there were a combination of shell scripts, functions, variables, bash settings, etc.  I was hoping to have a bit more targeted conversation about useful, elegant single line shell commands.  Will add these to that thread. Best, -C <comment130498> If there's a different problem, go ahead and edit this to make it clear what problem is being solved here (as opposed to a "greatest hits") and we can look at reopening it. No worries - closing is just a temporary chance to edit and reopen if there is a better way to phrase this. <comment130502> Thanks Mike.  I appreciate your help.  Will gain some street cred and then may try to broach this topic again.
