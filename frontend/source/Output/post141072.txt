Cannot install MacVim 7.4 on OS X Maverick 10.9.4? <body> I have codebrew/code installed (v 0.9.5) along with Xcode (Version 5.1.1 (5B1008)). When I attempt to install MacVim like so I encounter the following error message:  precode$ brew install macvim ==&gt; Downloading https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/archive/snapshot-73.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/macvim-7.4-73.tar.gz ==&gt; ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-multibyte --with-macarchs=x86_64 - ==&gt; make make[1]: *** [objects/os_mac_conv.o] Error 1 make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs.... 1 error generated. make[1]: *** [objects/os_macosx.o] Error 1 make: *** [first] Error 2  READ THIS: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting  These open issues may also help: macvim failed to build on 10.9 because of x11 (https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/30253) /code/pre  How can I resolve this issue?   strongNOTE:/strong Much of what I've found seems to state that I need to install some command line component to Xcode but I wasn't able to figure out what this actually entailed.  <answer141073> I solved this issue thanks to the following tip I found as to how to install Xcode from the MacPorts page.  emexcerpt/em     2.1.1. Install Xcode on OS X 10.9 or later      Download the latest version of Xcode from the Apple developer   website or get it using the Mac App Store.        Once you have Xcode installed, open a terminal, run codexcode-select --install/code, and click the Install button to install the required command line developer tools. Don't worry if you see a message telling   you the software cannot be installed because it is not currently   available from the Software Update Server. This usually means you   already have the latest version installed. You can also get the   command line tools from the Apple developer website.   The key piece of information was to run this command:  precode$ xcode-select --install /code/pre  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UGNov.png" alt="ss#1"  After installing the command line tools you should be able to successfully install codemacvim/code using codebrew/code.  precode$ brew install macvim ==&gt; Downloading https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/archive/snapshot-73.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/macvim-7.4-73.tar.gz ==&gt; ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-multibyte --with-macarchs=x86_64 - ==&gt; make ==&gt; Caveats .app bundles were installed.
