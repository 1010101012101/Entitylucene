How do I destroy postfix on mac os x <body> I see these two log statements non-stop in my console logs.. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HnU8l.png" alt="postfix error"  I have previously tried to eliminate postfix using this command  precodesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist /code/pre  and  precodesudo launchctl remove /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postfix.master.plist /code/pre  But it keeps coming back to life after every reboot.  Do I really need postfix? I am a regular GMail user and I don't need any system apps to send emails.  I tried using the instructions at  How can I revert my etc/postfix/main.cf file? to reset my postfix configuration to the stock version with the hope that it might start working normally but it did not help.  <comment307614> Did you see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/180070/org-postfix-master-service-exited-with-abnormal-code-1 ? <comment307622> Tried it. No luck. I have to find out where it logs its problems. Not much in console. <comment307623> I just added a root crontab entry to shut it down. :)
