How do I add the LaunchPad Icon to the Dock after upgrading fom Snow Leopard to Mavericks? <body> I have upgraded a Snow Leopard system to Mavericks. I expected to see the LaunchPad icon (spaceship icon used to launch installed apps) on the Dock, but it is not there.  How do I add that icon? I have it on a Lion system and I also see screenshots of Mavericks that have it so I don't think it's gone.  <answer106523> The codeLaunchpad.app/code is located in your code/Application/code Folder.  You can either  ul linavigate with the Finder to your code/Application/code Folder and drag it to your dock/li lisearch codeLaunchpad.app/code in Spotlight and CMD+Click the App. Your Finder will open and you can drag the App to your dock/li /ul  <comment125071> Sorry, it seems I had my blinders on. I looked in the Application folder before I asked the question and it was not there. I looked again later and it was there.
