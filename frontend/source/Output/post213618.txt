Fusion drive unavailable after HD erase <body> I wanted to erase the 3 TB Fusion HD on my iMac in order to install a clean system and start from scratch. The erase went fine except right at the end when it said something about core storage... (which I failed to capture, sorry)... and now the machine behaves as though the drive only sort of half exists.  ul liThere is no 'sub-disk' when I look with Disk Utility - i.e., there is no indented drive listed below "Macintosh HD"/li liThe "Erase" tab is absent in Disk Utility/li liAll partition options are greyed out in Disk Utility/li liI can boot in Recovery Mode, but I can't reinstall OS X because there is no drive available - it asks me to select a disk, but no disks are listed/li lidiskutil sees the drive fine (screenshots below)/li /ul  In case it's not clear from the images, distil cs list shows:  precodeLogical Volume Group C970ADA-0D05-42AA-9E9C-403ED0E5335 Name: Macintosh HD Status: Online (3.1Tb)      Physical Volume 7DAE3935-D0AD-42AE-AE2A-F6001F09187     Index: 0     Disk: disk0s2     (120Gb)      Physical Volume BA37C009-F93C-4EAF-9EF3-9C19772BD91C     Index: 1     Disk: disk1s2     (3Tb) /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLtN9.jpg" alt="diskutil cs list screenshot"  diskutil list shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUOaT.jpg" alt="diskutil list screenshot"  <answer213620> You probably deleted your Logical Volume and the superior  Logical Volume Family.  To create a new one boot to Recovery Mode, open Terminal and simply enter:  precodediskutil cs list #to get the lvgUUID (UUID of the Logical Volume Group) diskutil cs createVolume lvgUUID type name size /code/pre  or in your case:  precodediskutil cs createVolume C970ADA-0D05-42AA-9E9C-403ED0E5335 jhfs+ "Macintosh HD" 100% /code/pre  <comment257902> Hi There. Massively appreciate the advice. <comment257903> Will let you know if it works. <comment257904> I get an answer saying "the ice (100) must be followed by a letter suffix"... Maybe there was one but it got cut off? I can only see half of that last zero in your post... <comment257907> Just found the percent sign on the end! Let's see if it works now... <comment257908> SUCCESS! You are completely awesome. Many, many thanks. All the best, <comment257909> @RichardBurke-Ward You're welcome ;-)
