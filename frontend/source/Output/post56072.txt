Enable "standby mode" for MacBook Pros <body> I can't get my 2012 13" MacBook Pro to standby (note: NOT regular sleep, see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4392).  My pmset -g results are:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1 AC Power        -1* Currently in use:  standbydelay   1800  standby    1  womp       0  halfdim    0  panicrestart   157680000  hibernatefile  /var/vm/sleepimage  sms        0  networkoversleep   0  disksleep  0  sleep      0  hibernatemode  3  ttyskeepawake  0  displaysleep   10  acwake     0  lidwake    1 /code/pre  Anyone has any idea what might go wrong which would prevent standby? Note: regular sleep works fine, but it does not enter standby after a period of time. I also reset the PRAM and SMC.  <answer56079> I don't think it's supported on your 13" MacBook Pro. From the KB article you linked (emphasis mine):     Apple Portables that support standby mode are:      ul   liMacBook Air (Mid 2010) and later/li   liMacBook Pro (emRetina, Mid 2012/em)/li   /ul   I parse the text in italics to mean the Mid 2012 Retina MacBook Pro, not "Mid 2012 MBP emand/em Retina MBP". This is further corroborated by the reference to the flash storage later on, which is only included by default on the MacBook Air and Retina MBP.  <answer65858> I can get my mid-2012 15" MBP to standby. Actually I got it to work after reading this post. I noticed the requirements for standby to work in the doc http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4392  My previous failed attempts were with my USB wireless mouse plugged in. So I removed USB receiver and detach power then close the lid, then after about 5 mins my MBP went to hibernate. Here's my pmset settings:  precode# pmset -g custom Battery Power:  lidwake              1  standbydelay         300  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  gpuswitch            2  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  displaysleep         2  sleep                10  acwake               0  halfdim              1  sms                  1  lessbright           1  disksleep            10 AC Power:  lidwake              1  standbydelay         300  standby              1  ttyskeepawake        1  hibernatemode        3  gpuswitch            2  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  womp                 0  displaysleep         10  networkoversleep     0  sleep                0  acwake               0  halfdim              1  sms                  1  disksleep            10 /code/pre  strongNeed to mention that I replaced the original apple internal hard disk with a SSD disk. Not sure if this is a critical factor./strong  <answer96459> By the way, my Macbook Pro (non-Retina and with normal HDD) can hibernate (hibernatemode 25) and standby (hibernatemode 3 standby 1).   For standby, it only does so if power is disconnected and there are no USB devices attached.  <comment64389> CanuckSkier is correct - the terminology is from [this site](http://support.apple.com/manuals/#macbookpro) where it's clear (retina, date) is different from (date). No non-retina MacBook Pro support this standby mode today. It's not yet clear if Mountain Lion and [Power Nap](http://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/features.html?siclientid=5899&sessguid=bb738736-3cd4-4bb3-af1e-45d1150ff1dd&userguid=bb738736-3cd4-4bb3-af1e-45d1150ff1dd&permguid=bb738736-3cd4-4bb3-af1e-45d1150ff1dd#powernap) will expand the list of "standby" eligible hardware. <comment64394> I think you might be wrong. From the pmset man page: "The setting **standby** will be visible in pmset -g if the feature **is supported on this machine**". Why would it be visible in pmset -g if it's not supported for my machine? <comment64396> I think the standby option in `pmset` is similar, but unrelated to the standby function in that article. As noted in [man pmset](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pmset.1.html), it's related to the hibernation. If you google around, you can also see plenty of evidence of `standby` getting set to 1 on pre-2012 MBPs as well. <comment64398> What makes you believe they are different? The functionality is the same (save RAM to disk after a period of regular sleep). Even if different, shouldn't either the `pmset` `standby` or the `article` `standby` work? <comment78560> What exactly (which commands) did you do to change the settings?
