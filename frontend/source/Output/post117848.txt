What are some tips to keep a leather iPhone 5S case looking good? <body> Purchased a Project Red case. It looked fairly dirty within a week, but had a cool worn feel to it. Now a few months in it looks disgusting. Any good tips on keeping it clean? I put some Allen Edmonds Leather Lotion on it but it didn't seem to help anything.  <comment137576> I'm also getting to the point where I need to attempt a deep cleaning or get a new case. It will be interesting if cleaning with detergent or a suede brush is effective. My guess is skin oils and whatever particulate materials it has attracted has coated the case and prevent the red dye from reflecting light as it did when new.
