Why are iChat and FaceTime separate programs? <body> What might be the idea behind this?  <answer9142> First and foremost because they use different protocols.   FaceTime was created as an implementation of a new protocol for video calls. Apple has pledged to release this protocol/format in the future with hopes of other software vendors adopting it so there is opportunity for interoperability.  iChat uses a variety of protocols for chat interaction, most of which were originally designed to carry text as a payload. Video in most cases was something added to these protocols after the fact.  Consider iChat the 'legacy' way of handling video and FaceTime the new way.  <comment9655> Hang on, lemme just call Steve. <comment9656> Sorry, I voted to close this question. This is no the place to speculate on Apple's business strategy. And there's no way somebody will have a definite answer. <comment9657> @Lo√Øc Wolff - I can imagine Steve's email response. Something like: "Because they are." <comment35536> Welcome to Ask Different! We can't answer for Apple's decisions. Answers to this will be based on speculation.
