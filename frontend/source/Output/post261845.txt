how to find shortcuts on mac <body> I am trying to find shortcuts for the apps I am use. I know I can go to the preferences of a an app and then go into the 'key bindings' to see its shortcut. However I want to hover over a specific button/menu item of an app and then find out what shortcut I can use to access that button.   Is there anyway to do that on a mac? I want to know this in general, but  learning to do this for Xcode would also suffice.  <comment327932> You can go into each menu, it displays the keyboard shortcut for each command. <comment327933> On a menu yes, but for actual buttons inside the app, no.
