How can I find my Java directory in 10.8.3? <body> I'm trying to run a Lejos application on an NXT. For it to work I need to set up a profile page with the path of Java. I know that Java doesn't come pre-installed on my Mac version, so I downloaded a .dmg to install it. I kept looking for what path the installer used, but I never found it.  I know that java is installed because I ran  precodejava -version  /code/pre  on terminal, but still can't find the path. Anyone else know how?  <answer92880> use "which" in terminal when you want to find the directory of a command:  precodewhich java /code/pre  returns  precode/usr/bin/java /code/pre  <answer92881> The command codewhich java/code will tell you where the codejava/code binary is within your code$PATH/code.  <comment108950> Thank you! Now to actually get to work. <comment108952> What exactly does the path need to tell Lejos?  Where to find the java compiler?
