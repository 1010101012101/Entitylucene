iTunes not working propperly with TSSTcorp CDDVD Device <body> I've installed a TSSTcorp CDDVDW SH-216AB Device on my PC (the only DVD drive).  Now I installed iTunes and it shows up the known Error Message   precodeDie Registrierungseinträge für die iTunes-Treiber zum Import und Brennen von CDs und DVDs fehlen. /code/pre  This means that the iTunes-Drivers for import and burning from CDs and DVDs are missing. My Problem with that is that my iPhone/iPad are not shown in iTunes.  Googling gave me the answer to add a Registry Item (Tutorial, German). I did so and it worked, the Message did not show up again. But I still cannot connect any iDevice with iTunes. Seeing the Device Manager in Windows, a warning sign gets shown at the TSSTcorp CDDVD Device. Removing the Registry Item and Re-Mounting the TSSTcorp Drive solves this problem - but then the Error Message on iTunes shows up again.  There must be an incompatibility or something with the CDDVD Drive and iTunes. Are there any commonly known solution for this problem? What should I do? I also followed all Steps on Apple Tutorials on how to make iPhones get shown in iTunes, didn't work either.  <comment77894> Are you running Windows or OS X? <comment77912> @SamuelEGiddins a PC was mentioned in the question <comment77936> do you have an HP printer, Logitech hardware/software, or burning software (like Roxio)? <comment77939> Umm yes there is a HP Printer PSC 1410 (very old model), and I am running Windows 7 <comment78079> Reinstall iTunes and report back the results. Also check if your CD/DVD drive came with a driver CD. If it did, install a driver. EDIT: Wait, I just realised I am the stupidest person on all of Ask Different. Does the CD/DVD drive work with other stuff like watching movies and stuff? <comment78197> I remember that these things caused iTunes driver issues...on an iOS device and will try to get back to you with a more complete answer, but I would try what @duci9y said in the mean time <comment78210> The cd/dvd drive works completely well, and I reinstalled iTunes several Times :/ <comment78289> after the fixed registry entries, did you make sure to press return (leaving one newline) after the last one you entered? <comment78479> Yes, I did. I actually tried it again, same result...
