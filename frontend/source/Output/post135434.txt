Wireless Diagnostics: what does "_handleLinkEvent: Got an error trying to queyer WiFi for power. Resetting state variables" mean? <body> I have a Macbook Pro (model 10,1) running OS X 10.9.3 (13D65) with a wireless problem; it keeps dropping connection. That is, it emsays/em it's connected, but if you ping a host...even localhost...the packets aren't returned for a period of time, then it comes up, only to lose connection after a few seconds, then it stays down for awhile before cycling back up again. If you turn off the wireless, it can ping localhost just fine. And a wired Ethernet connection works fine.  While troubleshooting I found this line in the logs:  _handleLinkEvent: Got an error trying to queyer WiFi for power. Resetting state variables.  That makes me suspect a hardware issue with the Airport card, but I can't seem to find documentation about that error anywhere. Does anyone know what would cause this or if there's another cause beyond hardware failure?  <answer135437> Example on my MBA 10.9.3  precode6/18/14 01:48:14.000 kernel[0]: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Sleep  6/18/14 01:48:16.000 kernel[0]: AirPort: Link Down on en0.

Summary: 0 Ierrs, 0 Oerrs. <comment160534> @Buscarì›ƒ so basically that error is just some status detritus, nothing that helps diagnose if it's software, software settings, or hardware problem. <comment223362> did you fix the problem? experiencing the same thing <comment256863> You suggested running `Airport -I`, but there is no `Airport` command in the path. Is it part of a specific package that needs to be run with full path?
