toggle playPause for iPhoto, script problem, probably global variable <body> I need toggle playPause for iPhoto, so I wrote this script  precodeglobal isPaused try     get isPaused on error     set isPaused to false end try tell application "iPhoto"     if slideshow running then         if isPaused then             resume slideshow         else             pause slideshow             set isPaused to true         end if     else         start slideshow     end if end tell /code/pre  I sent this command via ssh (with osascript -e '%s') and resume feature doesn't work (start and pause work correctly).  so I wrote helper script  precodetry     get toggle on error     set toggle to false end try tell application "iPhoto"     if toggle then         start slideshow     else         set toggle to true     end if end tell /code/pre  it works correctly when I run it via AppleScript editor, but not if I run this code via ssh.  [edited] I run scripts exactly this way:  precodeosascript -e 'try get toggle on error set toggle to false end try tell application "iPhoto" if toggle then start slideshow else set toggle to true end if end tell' /code/pre  <answer120037> I solved my problem, global variable was reset, now I store variable in file, here is the code:  precodeset thePath to (get path to scripts folder from user domain as text) &amp; â€œmyTempFile.scpt"  script theData     property IsPaused : missing value end script  try     set theData to load script file thePath on error     set IsPaused of theData to false end try  tell application "iPhoto"     if slideshow running then         if isPaused of theData then             resume slideshow         set isPaused of theData to false         else             pause slideshow             set isPaused of theData to true         end if     else         start slideshow     set isPaused of theData to false     end if end tell  store script theData in file thePath replacing yes return IsPaused of theData /code/pre  <comment139898> Could we see the exact ssh and osascript command as you enter it into the command line. <comment139899> I have just added it in my question
