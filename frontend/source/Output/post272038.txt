MacBook Pro 2016: Keyboard key stuck – how to remove key? <body> emRegularly/em different keys on my new MacBook Pro (2016) are stuck. I assume little pieces of dirt or small crumbs interfere with the mechanics. With older Mac keyboards, I occasionally removed individual keys for cleaning. As the keyboard of the current model was redesigned, it seems much harder to do so now and I can’t find any tutorials.  So: How do I remove (and reinstall) a key of a MacBook Pro (2016)?  <answer275833> I had the same issue with a stuck / spongy Enter key, and after reading through this Reddit thread I just did what people were suggesting there – strongstrongly blow air on it and keep on hammering the key at the same time/strong – and it fixed the issue, they key is nice and clicky again!  <answer287835> Be aware that damage to the keyboard trying to fix it, should be the last option as this will void any warranty.  It can be handed in to your local Apple for a review or follow Apple's own guide for removing dirt under your Macbook.

I think that it's not only a matter of dust, but a general problem for the new generation <comment349042> Thank you for your answer. I tried it and it didn’t help me. (I felt somewhat stupid about having to do this to an expensive device like this after such a short period of time). Others may succeed in trying so. I will go to the Apple Store as soon as possible. <comment350404> I've received a new laptop after four failed replacement keyboards.. More than one month for the support. The new laptop looks better, even if there is one key (dash sign) that seems also stuck from time to time. I guess that it's bad engineering and poor quality, I need to live with that. <comment359346> Helped me!! Thank you! <comment363468> Thanks for your answer. I assume there is dirt that can't be handled this way. (As this kind of dirt never occurred to me in two decades of owning notebooks before, it seems to be a keyboard mechanism issue.) <comment366569> Just sorted mine this way too, cheers.
