Changing the system language globally <body> I just installed Mac OS X Lion on an iMac.  I noticed that the system language during installation and log in screen is Spanish (my primary language). But, once inside (desktop, etc) is English.  I want strongeverything/strong to be in English. Including the log in screen etc. How do I change that?  <answer18159> You can use this link How to change the language of the login window, I hope it will help you.
