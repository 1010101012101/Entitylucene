Xcode: debug step into key conflict (F7) <body> I'm trying to debug using Xcode and how can I use Step Into (F7 key) with an external keyboard (not available FN key)? If I click F7 iTunes restart current song...   Any clue?  <answer202122> Check "Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys" in Keyboard Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Hua4.png" alt="Keyboard Preferences"  <comment243762> ....uh... after probably 6 years or more I actually looked at the my external Apple keyboard and I've found the "fn" key...... btw, thanks!
