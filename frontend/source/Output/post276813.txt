Right-click for Creating a New Document - How? <body> I am comfortable with creating new documents from command line on OS X (in my case El Capitan), but I wanted to explore the possibility to have Windows-like option to create a new document on right click. I have found the below script and I know that it needs running from Automator  Workflow  Run AppleScript:   precodeset doc_list to {"Add new..."} tell application "Finder"     if not (exists folder "NewHere" of folder (path to application support from user domain)) then         display dialog "This is the first time you've run NewHere." &amp; return &amp; return &amp; "Files added to the list are located at" &amp; return &amp; "~/Library/Application Support/NewHere" &amp; return &amp; "Removing a file from this folder removes it from the list."         make new folder at folder (path to application support from user domain) with properties {name:"NewHere"}     else         try             set doc_list to doc_list &amp; name of every file of folder "NewHere" of folder (path to application support from user domain) as list         end try     end if     set my_file to choose from list doc_list with prompt "Choose a document to place here"     if result is not false then         set my_file to item 1 of my_file as string         if my_file is "Add new..." then             set new_file to choose file             duplicate file new_file to folder "NewHere" of folder (path to application support from user domain) with replacing             set my_name to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a name for the new file." default answer (name of new_file as text))             my do_it((name of new_file as text), my_name)         else             set my_name to text returned of (display dialog "Enter a name for the new file." default answer my_file)             my do_it(my_file, my_name)         end if     end if end tell  on do_it(my_file, my_name)     tell application "Finder" to set my_dest to (folder of the front window) as text     set my_dest to my_dest &amp; my_name as text     set my_origin to (path to application support from user domain) &amp; "NewHere:" &amp; my_file as text     do shell script "cp " &amp; quoted form of (POSIX path of my_origin) &amp; " " &amp; quoted form of (POSIX path of my_dest)     tell application "Finder" to open my_dest as alias end do_it /code/pre  It prompts me with a windows saying, "Choose a document to place here". What am I supposed to do to have the script working?   <answer276827> Here is an strongAppleScript/strong I use as an strongAppleScript/strong emapplication/em so I can assign it the strongTextEdit/strong emicon/em and place it in the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong. Then it's available to create a new text document at whatever location strongFinder/strong is set to, that one has write permissions to. In other words, if one tries to create a new text document at a location that is only write accessible to e.g. coderoot/code or any location one does not have specific write permissions to, then one is notified upon trying to create the new text document.  The emcode/em checks to see if a file of the same name already exists and if so notifies and brings back the strongSave As:/strong emdialog box/em.  Open strong(Apple)Script Editor/strong and copy and paste the emcode/em below into the empty window and save it as strongCreate New Text File Here.app/strong. Make sure you select strongApplication/strong for strongFile Format:/strong in the strongSave As:/strong emdialog box/em.  Before adding it to the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong, you'll want to change it's icon to that of which is used by strongTextEdit/strong. You can open the strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em for each app and then copy and paste the one from strongTextEdit.app/strong to the one in strongCreate New Text File Here.app/strong. Note that this is the icon displayed in the top left corner of the strongGet Info/strong emsheet/em.  Now that it has a nicer icon, drag and drop the new app to the location on the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong you'd like for it to be.  To use, just click the strongCreate New Text File Here.app/strong emicon/em in the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong and you'll be prompted for a name and the a new text document file will be created and opened from the current location of the strongFinder/strong emwindow/em.  hr  precodeon run     my createNewTextFile() end run   on createNewTextFile()      tell application "Finder"         activate         set the currentFolder to (folder of the front window as alias)     end tell      tell me         activate         set fileName to ""         repeat while fileName = ""             display dialog "Save As:" with title "Create New Text File Here" default answer fileName buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} default button 2             set fileName to text returned of the result         end repeat         if fileName contains ".txt" then             set newTextFile to POSIX path of currentFolder &amp; fileName         else             set newTextFile to POSIX path of currentFolder &amp; fileName &amp; ".txt"         end if      end tell      tell application "Finder"         set itExists to (exists newTextFile as POSIX file)     end tell      tell me         activate         if itExists is false then             try                 do shell script "touch \"" &amp; newTextFile &amp; "\"; open \"" &amp; newTextFile &amp; "\""             on error                 display dialog "Cannot create the \"" &amp; newTextFile &amp; "\" file at this location!..." with title "Cannot Create File" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 with icon stop             end try         else             display dialog "The \"" &amp; newTextFile &amp; "\" file already exists!..." with title "File Already Exists" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 giving up after 5             my createNewTextFile()         end if     end tell  end createNewTextFile /code/pre  hr  Note that this emcode/em could also be used in strongAutomator/strong for a emService workflow/em, however I've found that I'm already in strongFinder/strong when I want to create a new text document and it's just easier to click the strongCreate New Text File Here.app/strong emicon/em in the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong then to emright-click/em and choose from the already over populated strongServices/strong emcontext menu/em that I have.  Additionally, if you modify the emcode/em once the emscript/em is saved as an application and placed in the strongToolbar/strong of strongFinder/strong, then you'll have to remove the icon from the strongToolbar/strong and then drag and drop the newly saved strongCreate New Text File Here.app/strong in order for it to work properly.  <answer277069> I have a script I run in the Finder with a keyboard shortcut from FastScripts (kbd⇧/kbdkbd⌃/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdN/kbd) that pops-up a pick-list of file templates (stored in a template folder).  To add new templates just place them in that folder.  Posted on StackExchange a few years ago: How to create a text file in a folder  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPUHd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  -ccs  <answer291303> I've been using New File Menu from the Mac App Store to create new files via right-click, &amp; it works just fine. It comes with 30 or so templates, but you can also create your own. Seems like it’s a lot easier solution.   You can find info about it at https://langui.net/new-file-menu/ &amp; at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/new-file-menu/id1064959555?mt=12.   <comment348456> That _script_, the AppleScript _code_ in your question, in no way provides for a "Windows-like option to create a new document on right click" even if wrapped in an Automator Service workflow. <comment348458> I was looking for something like this: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100509134904820
