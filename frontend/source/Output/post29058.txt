Remove extra icons on startup <body> I used to have two iMacs running Lion connected to each other via Firewire.  On starting up a computer, two icons representing both computers would appear. I would select one and type in the password.  Now I have sold one of the computers but both icons still appear on start-up, requiring me to choose one.  How do I eliminate the unnecessary start-up icon?  <comment33380> I don't think posting your e-mail address is necessary, you *can* click something about e-mail alerts for answers. <comment33382> Could you possibly take a picture of the selection screen? <comment33389> Yes please post a picture - I'm quite curious as to how you were "selecting a machine" as opposed to just booting one iMac and connecting to the other one via Firewire Target Disk Mode. <comment33399> Or do you have two bootable partitions (Bootcamp maybe) on your Mac?
