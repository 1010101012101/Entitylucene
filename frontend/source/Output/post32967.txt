Interrupted Mac App Store Download - Xcode <body> After losing my connection while downloading Xcode 4.2.1, the App Store has removed it from available updates and under purchases it says I am up to date (even though the date of the my installed version is before the latest update date). I have tried to do:  precodedefaults write com.apple.appstore ShowDebugMenu -bool true /code/pre  And then use the Debug menu item after restarting the App Store using these instructions:  http://www.ryanragle.com/index.php?/site/comments/where-does-the-mac-app-store-download-temp-files-to  Is there any other way to directly download 4.2.1 or to force the App Store to clear its cache, short of removing Xcode entirely?  <answer32984> Click on Purchases by keeping the ⌥ key pressed (option key). It will need 10 seconds to initiate the tab (more or less), but afterwards you'll be able to re-download any purchased app.  <comment37746> I found that too in the link above, but it still shows all my purchases with "installed" next to the old xcode. <comment37751> Even if you wait a lot of time with the ⌥ key pressed? And what about the "Check for unfinished downloads" menu item? <comment37758> nope, it saws all purchases complete. I think you need to uninstall before you can install a purchase... <comment170008> i know this will seem too obvious, but it saved me with a botched mavericks. could there be an 'install xcode' app in your applicaitons folder -- or something similar?
