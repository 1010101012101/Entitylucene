How do I automatically add podcast episodes to my iPod Touch 5 from my iTunes 12 instead of having to get them from the cloud? <body> I have subscribed to a podcast added several of the older episodes to iTunes 12 on my PC and downloaded them from the cloud. Before syncing my iPod Touch 5, I have selected the that podcast to be added to the iPod. The episode appears on my iPod, but requires that I also click the cloud button to download it to my iPod. This is more than frustrating considering the number of episodes and that I don't always have WiFi connectivity when I want to listen to the podcast.  So, is there a way to tell iTunes 12 on my PC (or the iPod) that when I select an episode to listen to, please automatically download it to my iPod without requiring me to click the cloud button?  BTW, it does seem to automatically download the most recent episode for subscribed podcasts. So the problem is when selecting past episodes to listen to.
