Working with 16:9 footage in FCE 4 <body> I have 16:9 footage that I am working with in FCE 4. When I drop the footage into a sequence, the viewing area is 4:3. Then when I export it, I export it as 16:9, and it looks like stretched 4:3. Help! How do I fix this problem? Is there a setting that I need to change? I have already tried changing both the video clip settings and the sequence settings to anamorphic. That didn't help; it looked like stretched 4:3.  <answer23922> You are looking for strongemAnamorphic/em/strong.  To make a sequence anamorphic, right click on it and select strongemItem Properties.../em/strong In the resulting window, check strongemAnamorphic/em/strong (or the space where the check should be). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeSSh.png" alt="FCE sequence settings" To permanently change this setting for all future sequences, select strongemDV-NTSC Anamorphic/em/strong under strongemFinal Cut Express  Easy Setup.../em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EIKKY.png" alt="fce easy setup"  <comment26710> That makes the footage look like stretched 4:3
