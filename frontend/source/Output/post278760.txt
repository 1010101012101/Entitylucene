queue and crossfade apple music on iPad <body> I would like to do a pretty simple thing and I feel like apple's walled garden again doesn't let me.  For a little party I would like to play music that I preloaded onto my iPad from Apple music.  I would like to   ol liqueue new songs while the music is playing on the iPad/li liautomatically adjust song playback volume to the same level/li licrossfade between the songs/li /ol  This are pretty basic requirements for any party where people are supposed to dance.  iTunes on iOS lets me do 1. and 2. but not 3. I have not found an app that lets me do all three things. It looks like no app can playback the DRMed Apple Music songs.  For example this app would habe been perfect. But it can't playback the DRMed songs. Very frustrating!
