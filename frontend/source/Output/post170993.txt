Macbook Pro TrackPad not clicking <body> I'm using a macbook pro, now the TrackPad could not be "clicked" when I press the bottom right corner.   I couldn't do the "right click" now.  This is awkward.  I know that in System Preference - TrackPad, I could set the "Tap to click", but then I couldn't use the three fingers swipe to toggle different screens.  Any idea to fix it?  <answer170995> Depending on your macbook pro model you should see a small screw on it inside the computer. Just do 1/4 turn left or right to adjust click on the trackpad  <answer171002> Have you tried four/three fingers and/or two finger tap/click?  Settings have an option to change between four/three fingers for swiping between full screen apps and has a two finger tap or click option too.  In my opinion Macbook pros have a large right click corners. too large for me and can accidently click with the palm of my hand.  <answer210250> This video recommends resetting the SMC:  ol liTurn off your computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe adapter./li liPress Shift-Option-Control, on the left side of the keyboard, and the power button, at the same time and hold it for 5 seconds./li liLet go of all the buttons./li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  <answer251182> Sometimes its just your magic mouse is sitting somewhere, maybe in your bag and triggering a click. Make sure you turn off the bluetooth.   <answer259874> Magic Mouse connected in the laptop bag! Make sure to check bluetooth connections!  <answer282868> Bend your trackpad from the opposite side of your mac, and you will find the clicking works again.( and fail again in several minutes)  <comment227532> It is also worth noting that on most models, if the battery has began swelling, it can prevent clicking. <comment288342> This worked great. For some reason, I was unable to physically touch-down and feel the 'click`, but after doing the above, everything returned to normal. <comment340194> Not quite sure of the logic as to why this works (thought it was a hardware fail), but it did work for me too! Thanks so much <comment366432> @TGYK: I've heard about the battery-swelling thing too, but I haven't been able to find a good source that verifies that it is a real problem and/or what to do about it. I'm also wondering how the temperature of the computer or the ambient-air affects swelling. I experience the trackpad-clicking issue intermittently, but I'm on my second battery. It's not clear if/how the new battery affected the issue. <comment366433> @nizx: Your solution sounds intriguing. It would be helpful to see a photo (or other details) that illustrates exactly how to access and locate the screw that can be adjusted. <comment371747> Mine was not even clicking physically, after this it started Amazing!.
