Why Did Time Machine Delete My Old Backups? <body> I recently upgraded my hard drive from the stock Hitachi 250GB to a Western Digital 320GB. I restored from Time Machine.  I plugged in my hard drive today and left my hard drive to back up. Surprisingly, when I came back, the backups were being deleted.   Why?   It was the same installation. Now my unrecoverable backups are gone.   <answer11263> After a full restore, a full backup is preformed (always). It's by design. This is also documented on the wonderful Podini - About Time Machine site, section TM is doing a full backup for no good reason. Other circumstances, that may trigger full backup, are listed too.  I quote:     strongAnd Time Machine may do a full backup after any of the following:/strongbr    * A full restore, whether from Time Machine or a "clone" (probably)   <comment11776> Were you (close to) out of space on the external drive? <comment11780> The signature likely changed with the new drive, but my experience is that it wouldn't back up rather than deleting them. Perhaps it is different if using Time Machine without a Time Capsule? Not having to deal with multiple machines, maybe it just overwrites what is there if the signature is different? Just a guess. <comment11800> Nathan - 90GB left on the HD.
