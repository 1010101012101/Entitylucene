Keyboard shortcut for "Show Desktop" <body> What is the OS X equivalent of kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdAlt/kbd+kbdD/kbd for Linux or kbdWin/kbd+kbdD/kbd for Windows to show the desktop.  Tried to search but didn't get some feasible answer.  <answer83641> The kbdF11/kbd key shows the desktop by default.  If you would like to change it, you can in the keyboard preference pane under keyboard shortcuts, Mission Control. Feel free to make it kbdCtrl/kbd-kbdAlt/kbd-kbdD/kbd or kbdFn/kbd-kbdD/kbd  Be aware that the function keys normally map to volume control / brightness, so you have to hold the kbdfn/kbd key down to get kbdF11/kbd to be kbdF11/kbd instead of kbd/kbd em(the best I can do for the volume down icon that coexists on the key labeled F11.)/em
