MBA6,2 10.11 faulty temp sensor 230~300% kernel_task problem <body> Problem started after I sprayed some water during shower. Fan runs on 6500rpm as soon as I log on and kernel task stays on 230~300% even though laptop is not even warm.  So I ran HWmonitor and it reads 128 celcius degree for Memory module 1 proximity, airport Proximity, mainboard proximity, Heatpipe in and out going air.  So I am guessing that is why machine is getting throttle to protect itself.  Things I have done so far:  VRAM,SMC reset(prob misspelled it): it worked and machine worked normal sometimes but not anymore.  removing Mac-7DF21CB3ED6977E5.plist: sounded promising but did not work for me.  running apple hardware diagnosis, it suggested me to get a new battery.  I am thinking about unloading whole /System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/ but I doubt it would help.  I would more appreciate a quick fix something like disable or fool thermosensors or tweak system file to fool the machine.  I've done sysdiagnosis but there are too much logs and not sure which logs to provide for now.  I'll be doing several more sysdiagnosis just in case someone ask. I'll readily provide log if you need em.  Thanks in advance.  <comment265163> I'd look at this answer & think againâ€¦ http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/219097/85275
