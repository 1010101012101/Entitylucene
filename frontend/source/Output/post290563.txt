Changed User ID Whilst Logged In (Still Logged in Now) <body> I was changing some settings when I came across the user id in the accounts section. For some inexplicable reason I thought it meant my emnetwork/em User ID, ie what I would identify to a router with. No idea why I thought this. Anyway.  I changed my User ID. I am still logged in. I cannot open any programs, including terminal, to try and change it back.  Currently open  programs include: Finder (downloads folder), Firefox, Sublime and Outlook.   Currently I'm afraid to reboot. However I do have access to several other Windows/Linux machines and lots of flash drives if I need to download/install/prep a live boot/etc.  I need to figure out how to change my User ID back.  Solution I'm currently trying to work: I have a file explorer open. I have sublime open.   If I can find where OS X stores the User ID, I might be able to navigate to it and change it back to whatever it's supposed to be (501 I think?).  If anyone else has any ideas or solutions, I am all ears. In any case, I will post an update when it's solved one way or the other.  Edit: Update (since I said I would). The problem has been solved, Klanomath's solution below worked perfectly first time through. Thank you!  <answer290569> Reboot your Mac to Single User Mode (kbdcmd/kbdkbdS/kbd while booting) and enter at the prompt:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /sbin/mount -uw / /code/pre  Launch opendirectoryd:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  You will get some error messages - repeatedly.  Then enter (replacing emusername/em with your real user name):  precodedscl . -read /Users/username UniqueID /code/pre  You should get something like 272 (if you changed it to 272 accidentally)  Now change it back to 501 again and check the result:  precodedscl . -change /Users/username UniqueID 272 501 dscl . -read /Users/username UniqueID /code/pre  which should yield the original 501.  Then enter codeexit/code and boot to your GUI or better: reboot your Mac immediately with codeshutdown -r now/code to avoid errors based on the premature launch of opendirectoryd. I got some kextunload errors trying to shut down/reboot after booting directly to the GUI.  <comment366780> I changed the user id to 272. I know it's Sierra and recent, but not exactly what version as it won't let me open system preferences or "about this mac" <comment366786> Oh you rock! Fixed, thank you so much! <comment366788> Will do, thanks again!
