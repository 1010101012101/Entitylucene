Is the /Developer directory still needed for Xcode in OS X Mavericks? <body> The new Xcode is code.app/code and all the package contents are with it, inside the applications folder. Can I just delete code/Developer/code?  <answer114339> strongYes, you can delete this folder./strong  The new /Developer is located in /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer, so /Developer can be deleted.  <answer122528> As of Xcode 4.3, the /Developer directory is no longer needed.  See: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/Articles/xcode_4_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/1006-SW1  <answer138902> Xcode prior to 4.3, which is when Apple transitioned to a single repackaged code.app/code for their developer tools, also shipped with an codeuninstall-devtools/code command line utility. It takes a look at any receipts of Xcode installs on your system and reports that it's removing things like caches, as well. Invoke as:  codesudo /Developer/Library/uninstall-devtools/code  to do a complete removal of all pre-4.3 Xcode remnants on your system.  <comment133996> I'm commenting because I can't recall the exact XCode version where this changed, but I'm pretty certain this has been the case for a while now. Apple switched it shortly after they moved XCode dissemination to the App Store. Which makes sense because it'd be easier to maintain and update if it's self-contained. <comment163694> keep in mind that there may still exist some older build scripts which look for the Developer tools like xcodebuild in /Developer. The simplest way to go around errors caused by this is to symlink /Applications/Xcode.app/Developer to /Developer. <comment163857> The suggestion above is horrible, especially in this case as it aims to support legacy structure that is now obsolete. Altering files in .app directories breaks code signing (can test using `code sign`) and is reversed upon upgrading the package anyway. <comment163859> Note that this does affect certain components required by 4.3 <comment264826> It changed starting with version 4.3.
