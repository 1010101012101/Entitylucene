Upgrading to Snow Leopard without optical drive <body> I am currently running 10.4- Tiger.  I never updated because my optical drive went out and I never got it fixed. I called Apple and they said that I could upgrade to Snow Leopard, but not Lion.  So I have purchased Snow Leopard, but don't know how to load it.  Here's what I've tried:  1) Remote Install- from an imac and mac mini.  It won't recognize the connection.  2) I made an .iso of my Snow Leopard disc in disc utility.  I put it on a flash drive and tried to boot.  No going. I also tried to mount the .cdr directly from my desktop.  It goes through the beginning prompts and then says that I need to reboot to begin installation.  I suppose when it reboots, it loses the mount and doesn't begin the installation.    Long story short, any suggestions?  <answer25081> Instead of USB, use FireWire target disc mode - it generally works better than USB on older Macs. On the non-install machine, pop in a Snow Leopard DVD and restart while holding down the T key with both machines connected via FireWire.  If you just have an ISO, create a new partition on the non-install machine and copy the iso to that partition via Disk Utility.   <answer25083> You will need a USB drive (8GB) and access to another Mac. You can use any external drive instead of a USB drive, but be aware that you'll have to format the drive and you'll loose any content on it.  ul liInsert the Snow Leopard DVD and the USB drive into a Mac with a working optical drive/li liStart 'Disk Utility'.

I don't believe that you can actually perform the upgrade this way, but you can at least use it to create a formatted flash drive startup "disk" by following the steps in the solution above.  <comment28330> I've used this strategy to create a bootable SL "recovery" partition  on my internal drive so I never have any worries and it works beautifully. +1!
