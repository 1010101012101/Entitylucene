Safari Tabs not working properly <body> Over the past week or so, my Safari has been acting wonky. I work from home, online, and frequently have multiple tabs open. Lately, when I open a new tab and type in a url, something happens and the url I've just typed takes over one of the existing tabs I had on a different page. It's frustrating because I had the existing tab on a different page for a reason. Then the new tab ends up with nothing on it. How do I stop this from happening?  <comment340889> Try closing all the windows & relaunch, then from History, 'Reopen all windows from last session'. See if it freshes it up. <comment344516> I've been having the same issues happening for the past month or two. Seems to happen when I open multiple tabs consecutively where one overrides the other.
