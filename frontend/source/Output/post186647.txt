Volume encryption takes *hours*, is it possible to fix it? <body> I'm encrypting an emempty/em volume. Internet articles say that is must be almost instant â€” but it's not the case. It's probably doing a kind of wipe (securely erasing free space), but if I really don't need this, how can I disable this behavior?  <comment220388> Which articles say that it must be almost instant? From a security point of view, it kind of makes sense to fill up an encrypted drive with random value. <comment220397> @patrix But (in my case) it was already encrypted before erasing/repartitioning. What's the profit from wiping it again? There should be an option to disable this. <comment220398> @patrix [this](http://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-encrypt-one-volume-on-a-drive-in-os-x/) is an example of such article. <comment220437> Encrypting a disk is one of those times you really don't want to be trying to force it to stop. I'd just wait it out, then examine afterwards.
