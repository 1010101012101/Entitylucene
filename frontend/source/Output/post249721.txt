Format values in text cell <body> I have a chart with two percentage columns (min, max), and a third which is supposed to show the min-max range in absolute values. I use the formula code=A2*60&amp;" - "&amp;B2*60/code in cell codeC2/code. The expected result is (for an absolute max of 60):  precodeMin      | Max     | Range 33.3%    | 50.0%   | 20 - 30 /code/pre  Here's what I get:  precodeMin      | Max     | Range 33.3%    | 50.0%   | 2000.0% - 3000.0% /code/pre  The percentage columns are formatted to display a percentage value with one decimal, and this format is somewhat applied to the text.  If I change the formula to code=A2*$C$1&amp;" - "&amp;B2*$C$1/code, I get:  precodeMin      | Max     | 60 33.3%    | 50.0%   | 20.000 - 30.000 /code/pre  For every format on codeC1/code I get 3 decimals in the expression, except if I set the format to only one decimal in codeC1/code, I really get one decimal in the expression.  Question:Â How do I choose how the numbers are displayed in codeC2/code?  <answer249941> Using extra cells (which can be hidden) appears to be the only way I have found to control the emAutomatic/em formatting that strongNumbers/strong applies.  In separate cells for each desired number, do the calculation. codeA2*60/code then in another cell, codeB2*60/code  In your codeRange/code column, concatenate the results.  So if the cells containing code20/code and code30/code are in codeE2/code and codeF2/code then codeRange/code would have this formula:  codeE2 &amp; " - " &amp; F2/code  or:  codeconcatenate(E2," - ",F2)/code  Then if desired, hide E and F columns.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MXKud.png" alt="Formula results"  <comment309859> Can't you play with number formatter on the toolbar at the top? There should be options for data type, number of decimal places etc <comment309890> It has absolutely no effect on the cell with the formula. <comment309902> Hmmm odd I'll have a look in a bit
