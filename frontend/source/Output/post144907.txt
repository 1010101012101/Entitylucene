Ipad Air totally unresponsive <body> I was just using it and I let the screen go off and now it will  not do anything. I tried plugging it into a computer. It won't turn on or off. The battery was not low.   <answer144908> Typically, you still follow the traditional steps which does let you charge it for at least 30 minutes just to be sure the battery indication wasn't stuck at an incorrect reading:  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/TS3274/li /ul  If none of the steps there work, you'll need to take it in for hardware service or a replacement.  <comment170698> Try holding `Home` + `Power` button for a while. <comment170700> I tried plugging it into a computer but it doesn't even come up with the little thing either. Plus I had it on the charger ALL last night. It's been unplugged for 2 hours. <comment170701> Got it. Thanks!
