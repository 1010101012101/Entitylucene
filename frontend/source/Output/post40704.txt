Homebrew installed libraries, how do I use them? <body> I'm a bit confused.  I've installed a bunch of libraries (e.g. codevtk/code, codegsl/code,...) that I need for a  c++ project for school. I used homebrew to install them (luckily there were formulas available).  My question is, does Homebrew link these into code/usr/include/code or something comparable? Or is this something I would need to do manually?   Homebrew usually does this kind of stuff for executables, yet I can't seem the find the libraries anywhere other than in the code/usr/local/Cellar/.../code directories. I have a bunch of libraries installed so I can't simply use -L/... for each of them.  <answer40737> They are usually linked in code/usr/local/lib/code. If they are not there, try codebrew link &lt;library-you-are-installing&gt;/code; that should solve it.  <comment46060> Shouldn't whatever is in the `Cellar` be linked to the `/usr/local`? If it is a project, then I'd suggest using a Makefile; it would make things easier, does it not? <comment46079> didn't know that thanks!
