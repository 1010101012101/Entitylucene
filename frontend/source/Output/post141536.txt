Office for Mac 2011 Font Tahoma working but not showing in font list <body> I have the following problem: Using office for mac 2011 on Mac Os 10.9.4, I can use the font Tahoma in Word and Excel, but it doesn't show in the list, where you have to pick the font. If I just manually click into the list and write Tahoma, it works and I am able to use the Tahoma font.  Other applications, like TextEdit, show Tahoma and I am able to use it just from picking it from the font list.  I found lots of guides here one AskDifferent, as well as on the apple support forums and some other forums. Things I checked and tried:  ul liThe folder /Library/Fonts contains "Tahoma Bold.ttf" and "Tahoma.ttf"/li liThe folder /Library/Fonts/Microsoft doesn't contain any Tahoma fonts/li liI tried to copy the two fonts also to /Library/Fonts/Microsoft - this didn't work/li liI used font book to check the fonts and search for duplicates, everything was alright/li liI booted Mac Os using safe mode (holding shift) to reset the font cache, this didn't help either/li liMicrosoft Office is up to date, no new updates are available/li /ul  The strange thing is, that the font was showing before. Probably it was removed from the list during some previous updates.  Do you have some ideas, what else I could try? Thanks in advance!  <answer141553> Microsoft's applications use their own font cache. You could try deleting the cache and launch one of the applications again. It should just generate a new cache file.  You will find the cache file named "Office Font Cache" in "~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Office/Preferences/Office 2011".  <comment167153> thanks for the clue! Unfortunately it didn't work, I deleted the file, relaunched Word but it still doesn't show Tahoma in the font selection list. <comment225650> Just to add, I've had three separate users with this same issue.  All running Mavericks, all running Office 2011.  More than likely this is a bug with Microsoft Office 2011.
