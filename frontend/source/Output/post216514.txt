Is there an app to Control the Brightness of an External Monitor? <body> At the moment I use an app called "Dimmer than dim", it works fine, it lets me darken the monitor screen. But if I want to use an app full screen, Dimmer's effect disappears.  Google search, shows that there are many apps like Dimmer, but which one would work in full screen?   The F1 and F2 keys don't work for my external monitor.  My monitor doesn't have brightness controls.  <comment261662> Can't you just use F1 and F2? <comment261664> @Arc676 No, it doesn't work for my external monitor <comment261665> Does your monitor have any brightness controls? Or was the point to look for _software_ that could control your monitor brightness? <comment261669> @Arc676 No it doesn't have any controls. Yes, that was the point.
