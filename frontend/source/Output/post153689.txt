Can I delete things safely from ~/Library? <body> I am running out of storage space on my 2011 MacBook Air. I was thinking I should clean up before I contemplate adding more storage.  I notice though, that while I have ~30 GB in ~/Documents, ~2 in ~/Movies, ~10 ~/Pictures, I strongalso/strong have ~70 GB in the ~/Library folder.  What can I safely delete (if anything), and what is the best method to delete from this folder?  Here is the result of the codecd ~/Library; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16/code script:  precode46559   Developer 26874   Application Support 23941   Mail 4822    Containers 2030    MobileDevice 1524    Logs 1430    Caches 1371    iTunes 1032    Mobile Documents 229     Safari 65      Dragon Profile.ddictateprofile 40      Keychains 35      Preferences 33      Internet Plug-Ins 29      Mail Downloads 26      Autosave Information /code/pre  <answer153692> ~/Library is where all your apps store their prefs, how you want them to work for you.  It would generally be unwise to start playing in there without being certain of what you are doing....  That said, some apps can store large cache files in there, others may be folders for apps you long-since deleted - those would be safe candidates.  70GB is a pretty big lib, btw, mine is only 30GB &amp; I'm a heavy user.  I'd still be very, very careful in there, but maybe try something like Grand Perspective to see what the largest users are. (There's another similar tool I can't right now remember the name of. If someone remembers &amp; drops it in comments, that would be very nice)  Another way to hone down the largest users would be...  ul liOpen the ~/Library folder, set to List View/li liHit Cmd/J for View Options &amp; set to 'Calculate all sizes' [this may take a while]/li liBack in the ~/Lib folder, set to sort by Size from the column headers./li liApplication Support is usually the largest by quite some margin, so /li liCmd/double click that &amp; repeat the process.../li /ul  <answer153695> If you’ve deleted applications/programs, and they have leftovers in the Library/Application Support/ folder, then it is emprobably/em safe to clean out that program’s Library/Application Support/ subfolder. If, for example, I wanted to remove Firefox’s old data after uninstalling, I would go to Finder’s search box and type codefirefox/code. Make sure the search is set to codeThis Mac/code, then click the plus button underneath the search box to add codeSystem Files/code and codeare included/code. You’ll get a mix of small files and directories as a result (ideally). The folders are what you want to focus on. Clicking on a folder should show its path at the bottom of the finder window. If a Firefox folder is in USER/Library/Application Support/ I just delete the folder. Deleting the folder will also delete its content, so you may see your total number of search results drop as a consequence.  That being said, be careful. If in doubt, don’t delete it without referring to that programs documentation.  <answer153726> To see which folders inside code~/Library/code use most of the space, run something like  precodecd ~/Library; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16 /code/pre  in Terminal which gives you the 16 folders using the most space.  Specific cleanup actions afterwards depend on the folders found.  <comment180895> Can you open Terminal, enter `cd ~/Library; du -sm * | sort -rn | head -16` and add the result to your answer (by editing it)? This will give us an idea about which part of your Library folder eats the most space. <comment180900> wow - 50 GB in Dev... I've 3. But I don't really dev; I'll leave that to @patrix , my answer can probably go, as can the other 2 so far posted. <comment180902> Looks like I need to see what's happening in the dev folders and clean my mail box. @Patrix. Thanks for the focus. If you write the script as an answer, I can probably accept it <comment180905> hmm. while the above shows the results of the shell script, looking at the list through Finder shows a different picture.. App Support: 26GB, Developer: 20GB (still a lot), and Mail: 14GB.. strange <comment180908> Thanks to you all. Working through the dev folder is showing that in it's Xcode derived data folder, there is a slew of old project files. Projects long deleted. I will report this as a radar issue. <comment180912> If you’ve deleted applications/programs, and they have leftovers in the **Library/Application Support** folder, then it is probably safe to clean out that program’s **Library/Application Support** subfolder <comment180915> Good idea for an edit. Thank you. <comment180944> cheaper than buying a new drive :) <comment180967> Are you thinking of [OmniDiskSweeper](http://www.omnigroup.com/download/latest/OmniDiskSweeper)?
