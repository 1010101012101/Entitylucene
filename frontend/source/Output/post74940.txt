Can't do anything with external hard drive, “.Trashes” is probably the boogyman <body> I bought an external Samsung hard drive today. But I'm not able to do anything with it. Here are the problems I'm having:  ul liI can't put anything on the hard drive. Finder gets stuck at 'preparing copying files'/li liI can delete anything on the hard drive emsystem files/em, except the folder ".Trashes". It gives error 'Unexpected error: -50'/li liI tried to empty the trash can, but nothing changes./li liI set the file permission on the .Trashes to read/write everyone, doesn't change a thing/li liTrying to format the whole drive with Disk Utility, but quits at start, because the drive cannot be deactivated./li /ul  I've tried a few terminal commands   precodesudo -s -r rf /Volumes/Untitled\ 1/.Trashes` //Directory not empty   -r rf /Volumes/Untitled\ 1/.Trashes` //No permissions /code/pre  Also  precodecd /Volumes ls -al cd name_of_partition ls -al rm -rf .Trashes /code/pre  Again: Permission error.  Also:  ul liI can't change drive permissions via Disk Utility, via the button 'recover drive permissions', because it is 'blank'/li /ul  One thing that really bothers me: I really want to format the partition, but every time it says 'Disk cannot be deactivated', when trying to recover, wipe or format.  I really can't figure out how to delete .Trashes, format the drive or get the damn thing working.   Any suggestions?  <answer85750> I had the same problem today. After trying everything sudo I could do under the sun, manually trying to remove the .Trashes file through finder, etc I wound up just reformatting the drive.   The reformat took significantly less time than me trying to figure out how to get the drive empty. Probably better for the drive, anyway.  <comment87045> I don't know the exact steps, but maybe you do or someone else does. If you use a bootable OS X installer, there is a menu option to open Disk Utility. At that point, the drive should be fully configurable. When you write "deactivated", I assume you mean unmounted. Hope this helps.
