How do I stop iTunes from automatically opening when I browse an app on apple.com? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0hClw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Like when I go to one of these pages iTunes strongautomatically/strong opens up. It's really annoying. How can I disable this?  <answer227848> This does not happen for me on El Capitan. When I search for an app, Evernote for example, the first Google result is the app listing on iTunes. (Screenshot below.) If I want to download the app, I have to click the blue View in iTunes button below the app icon. iTunes is never opened until View in iTunes is clicked. What version of OS X are you running? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UQiYb.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer227863> https://gigaom.com/2010/03/15/how-to-stop-itunes-web-links-from-opening-itunes/  It looks like the browser you are using is chrome, so follow these steps  ol liGo to chrome://settings/contentExceptions#javascript/li liadd itunes.apple.com and mark "Block"/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iL0LH.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you want to see the app without seeing the "Opening the iTunes Store." page, visit The iTunes Link Maker and see if you can find the app on there.   (that was my solution before, but it seems now iTunes preview shows the app with a "Opening the iTunes Store." banner. By disabling Javascript on that page, you won't see the banner)  <comment277736> Let me know if I got the browser wrong, and I'll edit the answer. The link that I provided has the solutions for Firefox and Safari too. If they don't work, research on disabling Javascript for certain websites / iTunes <comment340239> Unfortunately this happens for me on macOS Sierra.
