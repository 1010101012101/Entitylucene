Charging issue MacBook Pro (late 2009) <body> I came home one day and the battery on my MacBook was dead. I plugged it in and the light stayed green.   After doing some research I reset the SMC and that didn't work. It caused the light to blink though. After playing with it for a while (removing the battery connection and such) I got it to turn on.   The battery stats said to service the battery so I purchased a new one.   After installing the new battery I am able to get it to charge by basically messing with it until it works.   What could cause this? Cleaning the leads on both sides of the connector seems to help, but I still have to mess with it to get it to work. Turning off the computer before I plug it in seems to help also.   I just want to be able to plug my Mac in when it needs to charge.   <comment142248> Could it be the Charger ? <comment142266> I was thinking charger too. You're using the same voltage charger your MBP came with? <comment142897> Yeah, I'm using the same original charger. I just haven't had the chance to test it with a different charger yet, and I don't want to spend the money unless I know for sure. All of the forums I have checked with people having the same symptoms tried a new charger and it didn't work. That is why I am so skeptical about buying a new charger without testing it first.
