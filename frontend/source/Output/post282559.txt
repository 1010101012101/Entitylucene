Present Keynote without showing editor <body> The scenario is that I have a computer whose screen is being projected and visible to an audience. Is it possible to start a Keynote presentation without showing the editor (and thus all the text on the first slide) to the audience? I know Microsoft Powerpoint lets you export a presentation so that opening it immediately starts the presentation. Can Keynote do this?  <answer282560> Go to the Document inspector and enable Automatically play upon open.                                               img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TtezT.png" width="271"  <comment356141> That works but it still flashes up the editor before playing the presentation, which is a bit annoying.
