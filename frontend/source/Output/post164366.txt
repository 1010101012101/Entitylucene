Is it possible to create (and save) a fluid app with multiple tabs? <body> I use Fluid to make webapps that I want open all the time function more like independant native apps, so they're not lost in a tab in my browser.  And Fluid allows for tabbed browsing, so I can choose to open another tab for a link, say, if I don't want to open it in my main (non-fluid) browser:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0faiM.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I can't find any way to emsave/em multiple tabs as the Fluid App's home page, like you can on any web browser.  I want the app to automaticially open two tabs, so one fluid app can be for chat, but have a tab for two different chat rooms, one for Trello, but with tabs for a couple of boards, etc.  Am I missing some way to do this?  <answer164397> Developer of Fluid here. Although there's no explicit support for this, it can sorta be accomplished by:  ol liLaunch your Fluid App and set up the windows and tabs you would like to appear on launch./li liEnsure that the following preference is emenabled/em:  Preferences  Behavior  On startup restore windows and tabs from last time/li liQuit and relaunch your Fluid App, and you'll see the same windows and tabs are open./li /ol  <answer223661> So obviously a bit late here, but I found a workaround for those that really want this.  You will need access to a HTTP server (it may work with file:// urls, but I have not checked).  What you will do is create a HTML file that spawns tabs with the windows you want to launch, then closes itself.  Steps:  ul liAdd your domain to the whitelist tab, as well as the domains of the sites you want to open./li liIn the Security tab, uncheck "Block pop-ups"/li liAdd a file on your server with the following content.  In my case, I used it to open multiple Slack windows (yes I know they support multiple accounts, but this was better for me):  precode&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;     window.open('https://a.slack.com', 'a');     window.open('https://b.slack.com', 'b');     window.close(); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loading Slack...&lt;/p&gt; /code/pre/li liLink to that file as your startup page./li /ul  <comment192733> you'll just need to remember to set the tabs up like you want each time you quit. <comment192978> Todd, that's a great workaround for my needs.  And not much makes me love a product more than when I see its devs actively responding to questions on our sites - thanks a ton. <comment240593> My new Fluid app defaulted to a whitelist, and would open the new URL I wanted in an external browser until I added it to this whitelist.
