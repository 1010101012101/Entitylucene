iHeartRadio not working on CarPlay <body> I am having a weird issue with CarPlay in my 2017 Chevy Colorado.  The iHeartRadio app was working just fine when I originally hooked it up to my truck.  The second time I hooked it up the app just kept loading and wouldn't play any music.  The third time I hooked it up the app doesn't even start.  Very weird.  Wondering how/if this can be fixed?  The app works just fine when my phone is not connected to my truck, when it is connected the app doesn't work.  All other app's work just fine.  I have an iPhone 6 Plus with iOS 10.3.2
