Is there a presentation mode on mac? <body> When watching a video, or making a presentation, is there an option or a tool to disable all screensaving, energy savings and all? Regardless of if the power is plugged, I'd like to keep the screen fully on.  I know I can manually adjust the settings everytime. But is there a "presentation" mode, in addition to "battery" and "power adapter" modes? Or a tool to achieve this?  Thanks  <answer4874> The best 3rd-party based solution for you is to use Caffeine.     emstrongAbout Caffeine:/em/strong   A tiny program that   puts an icon in the right side of your   menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac   from automatically going to sleep,   dimming the screen or starting screen   savers. Click it again to go back.   Hold down the Command key while   clicking to show the menu.   <answer4877> Nothing built-in to the OS, but MarcoPolo can be used to do what you want.  <comment4959> Caffeine does what the user requested, but I would suggest that the question was incomplete. When in presentation mode, you also want to make sure to either shut down the network, or shut down certain apps that use the network. You don't want an IM popping up mid-presentation... <comment4962> true sometimes, but when your presentation uses the network, that can be problematic :) <comment266418> While using Caffeine or a similar solution, you can stop notifications from popping up using the Do Not Disturb function built into OS X 10.8 and later. It's accessible from the notificaton centre found in the top-right: swipe down with two fingers to reveal the option.
