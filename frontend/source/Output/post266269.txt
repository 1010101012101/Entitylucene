Select correct app on connecting camera <body> How do you prevent Apple Photos from opening on connecting a camera.  I prefer to download all my work to Lightroom 3.   <answer266325> You can use Image Capture [in Applications] to dictate which photo app [or none at all] will open when you attach any photographic device, phone, camera, SD/CF card etc  I have mine set so that Image Capture itself launches when I insert a camera card, but ignores when my iPhone is connected.
