ClickLock: Enable Drag after Long Click <body> I am new user of Macbook and I love it, but  I need ClickLock feature (Like on Windows Mouse Settings) because I have cerebral palsy and I can't drag normally.  strongThe idea of ClickLock feature:/strong Long click (~30ms) to enable dragging and click to turn of.  Any ideas how to do it?  The best, Lukasz   <answer217446> I trust that the emDrag Lock/em feature should derelict what you need. You can activate it in the system preferences. I would also suggest that you have a look at this discussion that explains how the drag and lock an similar options work.  <comment262859> Thank  you for answer, however it isn`t exactly what I need because the DragLock works only for touch, but not click.
