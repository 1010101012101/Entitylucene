Homebrew mutt(1) file permission weirdness <body> I just installed mutt ('brew install mutt') running as myself (uid=501(john)), no sudo.  It seems to have worked, but now I've got a couple of weird permission problems.  ol liWhen I run mutt, email always appears new and I can't delete it.  When I try, the screen flashes (visual bell, I guess) and I get "Mailbox is read-only".  The mailbox appears to be /var/mail/john, and codels/code gives me this:  precode-rw-------  1 john  mail  607 Jun 24 11:25 /var/mail/john /code/pre  (I'm not in the codemail/code group.  Should I be?)/li liWhen I run mutt as another user on the system, I get different errors.  precodesudo su - conrad /code/pre  Now my uid (as given by id(1)) is 502 (conrad).  This time when I run mutt, as before (just plain codemutt/code on the command line), I get slightly different errors:  precode/Users/conrad/.mbox: No such file or directory (errno = 2) /code/pre  (If I supply code-f /var/mail/conrad/code then I go back to case 1.)  If I use codesudo/code to run mutt, then everything's copacetic, but that doesn't seem right./li /ol  How do I fix this?  I guess I'm asking two questions:  ol liHow do I fix the file permission issue?/li liHow do I make mutt, when run as another user besides the one that installed it, by default read from code/var/mail/*username*/code instead of code/Users/*username*/.mbox/code?/li /ol  My software is running the specific versions:  precodeDeimos$ sw_vers ProductName:    Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.10.3 BuildVersion:   14D136  Deimos$ brew info mutt | head -1 mutt: stable 1.5.23 (bottled), HEAD /code/pre  <answer192933> OK. I'll try to answer both questions and if you need a follow on question to get progress that's fine as well.  ol liDon't su between users to test things that are broken. It's far better to let OS X allow fast user switching and get a real, honest terminal open for the new user to test/li liAll you should need to do is have the user used to set up homebrew allow group read and execute permissions to the programs in /usr/local/bin for a group that contains all the users on the system./li /ol  By default, I have /usr/local owned by user 501 and controlled by group admin (80). You could either codechown -R 501:staff /usr/local/*/code or add the users you want to the admin group and keep the homebrew files accessible to admin users.  Worst case, fire up a new user account and tell us what you get when you execute mutt on that user without codesu/code - just logging in directly to that account.  <answer193067> Ok, I still don't know what's going on with the code.mbox/code thing.  I suspect that's a mutt/mail config issue of some sort.  BUT... I have a solution for the inability to write /var/mail/emusername/em.  http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100609140550467  precodedseditgroup -o edit -u john -p -a john -t user mail dseditgroup -o edit -u john -p -a conrad -t user mail /code/pre  (john is the admin user)  I added both users in question to the codemail/code group and now both users can use codemutt/code (no command-line arguments) to read their mail spool.  (As an expedient hack to get rid of the visual flag/error message for .mbox, I did:  precodetouch ~/.mbox chmod go-rwx ~/.mbox /code/pre  )  <comment229765> Could you let us know your versions? `sw_vers` and `brew info mutt | head -1` would help us narrow down what you need. This seems to be several issues and questions and you might need some winnowing down to one initial problem. <comment229768> Info supplied in edit (thanks). <comment229782> I'll try that the next time I have physical access to the Mac. <comment229946> Logged on at home.  Now both users see the "no .mbox" error, and (still) neither user can access /var/mail/username. Consistency! I'll post what worked for me as an answer.
