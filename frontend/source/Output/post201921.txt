Computer or iPhone glitch <body> My computer recognizes my iPhone 5 but not my iPhone 4 and yet both are recognized by iTunes.  I've tried all the received suggestions: restarting the computer and iPhone 4, changing the USB cable, changing ports- but to no avail.  <answer202132> Your iPhone 4 needs to generate a pairing record and trust the computer.  First go through each of the steps. Don't skip steps and do them in order.  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095  If you don't see this message when you try to sync the phone over USB with iTunes, then you can remove all pairing records as follows:  ol liBack up iPhone 4 (to the cloud or a computer)/li liErase iPhone 4 (settings - erase all content and settings)/li liRestore the backup to iPhone 4/li liConnect iPhone 4 to the computer over USB and be sure you Trust when prompted on the iPhone./li /ol  If the above doesn't work, then restore the phone and repeat the third and further steps above.  <comment243483> Your question is unclear.  Is iTunes running on this same computer?  Meaning iTunes on computer#1 recognizes both my iPhone 4 and 5, but the computer doesn't?  What specifically are you expecting the computer to recognize? <comment243772> Yes, iTunes is running and recognizes my computer. What I'd like to see is my iPhone 4 icon appear on my computer so that I can add or download pics
