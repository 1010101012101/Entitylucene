Restoring deleted iTunes 12 user music libraries <body> After having updated iTunes, my entire music library disappeared. What can I do to restore it?  <answer200918> When iTunes updated, whether automatically or under your permission, it replaced its data which contained information on getting your music. None of the music that you have downloaded via iTunes, or even added into iTunes from a CD won't appear. What only appears is links to stream anything that has been purchased from iTunes, even though it may still exist on your computer.  To fix this, do the following:  ol liNavigate to your computer's music folder.  This is normally the folder called "Music". On Mac OS X computers, you can type this in Terminal:  precodeopen music /code/pre  This should open your music folder.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGmrt.png" alt="User Music Folder"/li liNavigate to the iTunes folder  In the music folder, you should see an "iTunes" folder, which has a few files. Locate the codeiTunes Library.itl/code file. Rename it to codeiTunes Library (corrupt).itl/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4o9Hd.png" alt="User iTunes folder"/li liLocate the missing user library  Next, there should be a folder called codePrevious iTunes Libraries/code. Inside this folder, should be a few files, which are called codeiTunes Library/code followed by the date. Choose the latest file (The order is Year-Month-Day. e.g. code2015-08-18/code for August 18th 2015). Copy the file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Utk9o.png" alt="User Copy iTunes Lib Backup"/li liPlace the user library back to its proper spot  Now that you've copied the iTunes library that holds all the information about your real music libraries, we need to place it back where it belongs. Go back to the folder where you renamed a file to codeiTunes Library (corrupt).itl/code. Paste the copied library here, and rename it to codeiTunes Library.itl/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qOPh3.png" alt="User Corrupt Library Rename" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l6yj4.png" alt="User Proper Library Rename"/li liRestart iTunes and Voila!
