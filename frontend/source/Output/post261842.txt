Cannot boot from usb <body> Recently I replaced the optical drive to SSD to make a fusion drive in my Macbook Pro 13 inch 2012. The hardware installation was successful and it is recognized in Disk Utility. I made a Sierra bootable drive on my 8GB USB drive with DiskMaker X.  The problem is I can't see the USB drive in the boot manager (press option when power up). I'm sure that the USB port in my mac is working. I can see my Time Machine drive in the boot manager and my USB drive after the boot from the original HDD with sierra. I can't make a fusion drive when I can't boot from USB. What can I do?  <answer261848> I would recommend you to try to use another method of creating the bootable USB drive, like another tool Install Disk Creator.  The best option though is not to use any 3rd party tool (you're not sure if it supports the latest version of MacOS) and use terminal instead. Official documentation is here and you can find a more detailed guide for example on this website.  <answer261852> h2Try creating the USB Installer via Terminal.app/h2  ol liDownload Sierra from the Mac App Store and leave it in your Applications Folder/li liReformat your USB stick to HFS+ Journaled and name it Untitled/li liFrom Terminal copy and paste this   precodesudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app /code/pre/li /ol  That's it!  <comment327915> Are you sure that your version of Diskmaker X supports MacOS Sierra? Did you get any error messages when creating a bootable drive? <comment327919> I tried before. Still cant. <comment328014> The latest version of Diskmaker X claim that they support Sierra. I didn't get any error messages. <comment328063> What if you try different USB drive?
