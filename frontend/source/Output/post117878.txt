Mount NTFS on OS X <body> I am having trouble mounting one of my NTFS drives in OS X.  I've added the following entry to my fstab with the 'vifs' command.  precodeUUID=UUID_FROM_DISK_UTILITY /data ntfs rw,auto,nobrowse /code/pre  I have created the /data mountpoint with 'mkdir /data' and attempted to mount with 'mount -a'.  I get the following error:  precodemount_ntfs: UUID=UUID_FROM_DISK_UTILITY on /data: No such file or directory /code/pre  Edit: I can mount with the disk utility, but not from the terminal.  What am I missing?  <answer117879> I've only ever mounted NTFS drives in code/Volumes//code so what happens if you replace the code/data/code with codenone/code and allow the System to choose the mount name?  <answer181264> http://sourceforge.net/projects/native-ntfs-osx/files/  Native solution.
