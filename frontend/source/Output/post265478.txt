Export all photos/video from Mac Photos in a YYYY\MM-DD-Album Name format? <body> I'm trying to extract all my photos/videos from Photos to keep a backup independent of a specific app/service. How do I export emALL/em (even in no albums) photos/video from Mac Photos in a code\YYYY\MM-DD-album_name_if_exists\filename.jpg/mp4/mov/code format?  I suspect I might need some AppleScript here especially to extract the date or album name info.  <comment332824> There is similar question (with answers) though there is no automation to the export part there. So I would keep this question as it has different specifics.
