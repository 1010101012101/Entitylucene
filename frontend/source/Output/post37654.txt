How do I install a Theme in Keynote? <body> I just downloaded several themes that I want to use. They are in code/Library/Application Support/Keynote/Themes//code but I don't see them in the Theme Chooser screen.   Does anyone know what else I should be doing to install them?  Thanks!  <answer37759> Typically they should be in:   precode~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Keynote/Themes/ /code/pre  You can copy yours there and they should show up; or when choosing a theme you can add them by navigating to the folder yours are in:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TOdZa.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer88119> This is different in Keynote '09.  The method I found that works comes from https://discussions.apple.com/message/8789217#8789217     It appears Apple has changed the way Keynote '09 accesses Themes.  If   you leave your 3rd party themes the way they were, Keynote '09 can't   seem to handle it and the theme chooser does not open or work   properly.      Apple's standard themes are now imbedded in the package contents of   Keynote. (if you don't know what that means, don't worry. For those   that care opt click show package contents ...   Keynotecontentsresourcesthemes). You will have to find the third   party themes you want to use. They may be located in the library    application support folder  iWork  Themes or somewhere like that   depending upon how you set it up before.      Once you find the themes, I suggest moving them to a place like the   desktop or your documents folder.      Once that has been done, Quit Keynote. Find the theme you want to   "import" Double click on it. Keynote '09 should open. Once it is open,   go to FileSave Theme.... you will be presented with the option to   name the theme and store it in a folder here   HDUsersHomeLibraryApplication SupportiWorkKeynoteThemes.      Once you have saved it, quit keynote. Open Keynote and go to the theme   chooser. Your new "imported" theme will be at the bottom after all of   the Apple standard themes.      Repeat for each theme you want to import.   That might be overkill, but it did work for me.  <answer210695> When you open a template or a common keynote file, you can use the option File â†’ Save theme... This puts your file in the necessary directory automatically and adds information about your theme to the welcome screen.
