Double Click to Open Program Mac <body> If I click on a .txt file, what exactly happens in order for Mac OS X to open my txt file with the Default Program (TextEdit in my case). In other words where does Mac OS look/what exact steps are involved to determine what my default program is and to open that file ? Where can this look up /process potentially/most likely be broken and how can I troubleshoot if Mac won't open the default program. Not for all programs but for one specific program ?   <answer137214> Rebuilding Launch Service Database did the trick:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  More details here:   http://www.maclife.com/article/howtos/how_rebuild_launchservices_remove_duplicates_open_menu  <answer137226> Here are the steps to configure application association in Mac OSX:   ul liFind the file type(s) that you want to change the application to open with/li liGet Info about a file that is of that file type, say a .mov/li liClick the ‘Open With’ arrow to expand an application list/li liChoose the application you want all files of this type to open with/li liClick “Change All” and then “Continue” when the confirmation dialog appears/li /ul  For a visual representation of the above steps, check out:   Change File Associations in Mac OS X  Information source: osxdaily.com   <comment163025> Sorry. Basically TextEdit did not open files with double click anymore (But if launched via Spotlight yes). This seemed such a random error and I wanted to understand the underlying logic of the launch process better. Therefore this question. <comment163032> Thank you for the notification.
