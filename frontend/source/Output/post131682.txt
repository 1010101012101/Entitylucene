Is it possible to remove Web Searches from Spotlight? <body> when I am searching anything with spotlight a category emWeb Searches/em appears at the bottom of the results. Clicking these links Safari opens and would search the web or wikipedia. But I never use these web searches and I would like to remove them.  Removing emWebpages/em from the spotlight system preferences did not help.  I found several instructions on removing emDeveloper/em and emOthers/em, or to rate the dictionary results up.  All these make use of code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spotlight.plist/code.  Maybe it is possible using this file, but I was not able to find out the proper value for the emname/em key in order to remove the emWeb Searches/em category. Or maybe there is another solution to this problem?  Any suggestions? I am using OS X Mavericks 10.9.3, btw.
