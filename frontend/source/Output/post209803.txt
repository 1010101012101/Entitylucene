How do I remove "nearby cocktail bars" on iOS 9? <body> A friend of mine in AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) asked me if I knew of a way to remove "nearby bars" from his iPhone. This appears when you swipe left and the built in Maps feature displays this.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VGXKP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer209819> You can open settings - general - Spotlight Search, then turn off maps. This is a workaround, but it will not give you gas stations or anything of that type either.  <comment253115> I wonder if you set some parental restrictions of that would be suppressed. <comment253145> I just sent [feedback](http://www.apple.com/feedback) to Apple suggesting this should be removable.  Specifically mentioning those in recovery thru AA.  The more people that send feedback the faster it will be addressed.
