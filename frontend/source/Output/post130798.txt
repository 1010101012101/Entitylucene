How to switch Preview's full screen default setting from "two-pages" to "continuous scroll"? <body> Whenever I open a pdf, Preview.app opens it in "continuous scroll" mode. However, when going into fullscreen mode, it switches to "two-pages" when, really, I want it to use whatever view mode I had it, in this case: "continuous scroll".  Anyone know how to remedy this? Or perhaps suggest an alternative to Preview.app?  I'm on Mavericks OSX 10.9.2.  <answer130913> As you know, per your question, the preferences in the Preview app only apply to documents when first opened. It seems that OS X has a built in default view for full screen documents. I tried a couple things...  ol liI opened a PDF to Full Screen and set the view to Continuous to see if this would stick and that view would be chosen next time I went full screen. Not the case./li liI searched every preference file related to Preview (also using 10.9.2) and found no setting even indirectly related to a view setting specifically when in full screen./li /ol  I'd say, doing what you want is either not possible at all or at best it'd require getting into a preference setting somewhere you wouldn't want to poke around with. My guess would be it's a setting inside Preview.app's package contents. Fooling around in there can get hairy  As an alternative to setting a new default, the keyboard shortcut to switch to Continuous view is:  precodeCMD+1 /code/pre  So you can just quickly hit that each time you go full screen and the view changes immediately. It's not exactly what you wanted, but it's a very fast alternative.  Hope that helps!  <answer209389> MacJournal is an exceptional blogging application, that I use for gathering snippets because it's far superior to Evernote, that has scalable and editable full screen viewing (light blue and dark grey or whatever combo you wish.

I tried searching for anything from `defaults read com.apple.Preview` to no avail. I'll opt to use the shortcut: `CMD+1`. Hopefully this is resolved on the next major OSX release. <comment213473> I am annoyed by the same thing. Sometimes I wonder what the heck the developers thought.... <comment293081> Fwiw, if there IS a setting inside Preview.app's package contents (or any other location I "shouldn't be messing with"), I would very much like to know about it. <comment348864> There's already an answer that suggests exactly what you suggest.
