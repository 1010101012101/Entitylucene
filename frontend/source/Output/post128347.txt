how to opn jnlp files automatically after download <body> I need to open JNLP files automatically after download just like in windows how can I do that I'm using OS X Mavericks  <answer128366> You could try this  ul liright click a jnlp file/li lichose "Open With"/li liselect "Other"/li linavigate to "System", "Library", "CoreServices"/li liscroll the list and pick "Java Web Start" (you may need to chose "Enable All Applications" in order to make that choice possible./li litick the "Always Open With" box./li /ul  It is not recommended to have a generic set up to open files downloaded from the web.  But you can set up a exception.   Specify the Folder for the jnpl files download.   Then create a Folder action to   1- monitor for new files  2-open them  <comment150686> but still its not opening automatically after download <comment150690> For security reason that is blocked. But it depends, so which Browser do you use for download? <comment150691> I used Safari for download
