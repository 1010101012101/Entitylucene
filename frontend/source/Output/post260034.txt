Fake VIP in Mail <body> Ok, so a company I did business with once has been haranguing me to sign up again using various email addresses. Their latest trick is to send emails (5 so far) and somehow put their name in my VIP list. I don't know strongemhow/em/strong the heck they did this. How I can stop them??   Thanks.
