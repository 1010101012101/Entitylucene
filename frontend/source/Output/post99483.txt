iOS and Macbook Pro/Air unable to join wifi network unless Network Isolation is enabled? <body> I have a Netgear WNDR3700v3 wifi router, broadcasting two networks, one at 2.4GHz and another at 5GHz.  I have found that iPhone AND Macbook devices are unable to join the 2.4GHz network (timeout error) unless the "Enable Wireless Isolation" option is enabled - 5GHz network works fine (obviously not for iPhones though since 5GHz is unsupported). I'm not entirely sure what the option does apart from prevent multicast/zeroconf on that interface.  I am using the following wifi settings for the 2.4Ghz network:  ul liRegion: EUROPE/li liEnable Wireless Isolation: ON/li liEnable SSID Broadcast: ON/li liChannel: AUTO/li liMode: Up to 300Mbps/li liSecurity: WPA2-PSK [AES]/li /ul  It's worth noting that I have disabled the built-in DHCP server on the router, and instead use an Ubuntu-based DHCP server instead.  Any ideas as to why this might be a problem?  <comment117092> It is a safety feature provided by Netgear. Check they instructions how to use it.
