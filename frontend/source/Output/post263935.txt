My mac is randomly renaming files on a shared folder <body> So this is an odd one. My Mac running El Capitan is randomly renaming files and folders that I open or save on a shared network drive (DROBO). The files are a random string of Upper and Lower case letters, numbers and the tilde symbol. However, I can see the filenames correctly, anyone else on the network see the random characters, this includes other Macs and PCs.  Does any one have any suggestions?  <comment330808> Can you give some details about the way you connect to the Drobo? <comment330825> @jstarek, thanks for the reply. I'm using the standard Finder Network shortcut
