How to force Safari resolve local URLs (localhost:9000, 127.0.0.1:3000 etc) on proxy? <body> I have a SOCKS5 proxy. I have a use-case, in which I want to route all traffic (even local URLs) via my proxy.  It works on Chrome &amp; Firefox. However, on Safari, it resolves the local URLs locally.  For codelocalhost/code, I have hacked around modifying my code/etc/hosts/code file, pointing localhost to my proxy server's IP.  Am not sure how to do the same for code127.0.0.1/code. Also, is there a better way to do the same for codelocalhost/code?  <comment290862> If you have to route localhost /127.0.0.1 traffic to a proxy there's something wrong with your use-case. <comment291013> @klanomath - My use-case is to provide https://www.browserstack.com/local-testing for Safari..
