How do I give it back?  <answer9140> http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/  Contact customer support via e-mail and hopefully you can get a refund.  <answer9143> You can dispute the purchase within iTunes.   ul liGo to iTunes Store, view your Account (login if needed). /li liFind and click on Purchase History./li liClick on the arrow next to the purchase to see the details/li liClick on the report a Problem Button/li liClick on the Report a Problem link next to the Playlist/Album in question. /li liSelect the Problem from the dropdown ( I inadvertently purchased this playlist)/li liFill in any comments. /li liHit Submit/li /ul  This will send the request off to Apple Customer Support and they should credit you back. I have not done this myself, but a co-worker has and said it worked fine. They will likely flag your account though if this becomes a common thing.  <comment9658> I have done this before and they are usually pretty helpful, as long as you do it straight away.
