How can I display the individual windows associated with a dock icon? <body> Say I'm working on a project and I am using Chrome and I have multiple profiles and/or windows open simultaneously. For example:  ul liPersonal Chrome Profile with Google Mail and Calendar open./li liWork Chrome Profile with Google Mail and Calendar open./li liA separate window using the work profile that has live updating results from changes I am making in Adobe Brackets./li liA separate window using the personal profile that is used for searching Google, Bing, etc./li /ul  Right now I have a single Chrome icon with a . under it indicating that there are multiple windows open. But what I can't see without a right click is what windows are open in Chrome. I'd like to have a mini-picture of each window (not tab) I have open in Chrome show up as an icon on the dock.  Is there any way to accomplish this? I'd also be open to alternative software, etc.  <comment326100> What about the F10 key (Expos√©)? For me, that shows all of the Windows of the application that has the focus.
