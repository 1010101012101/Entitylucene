How to delete all from the Voice Memos app on iOS? <body> I need to delete strongall/strong the tracks from Voice Memos in order to free up memory on my device. Deleting tracks one at a time is not an option since I have hundreds of them. I am using an iPod touch 4G.  <answer85911> Open the app and you'll find a little symbol with 3 horizontal stripes in the right bottom corner. You'll get a list and you can tap the memo and click "delete" right afterwards.  Or in iTunes you can select all voice memo's after you've synced them to your PC and delete them from there.  <comment99202> This is not the right answer. <comment99228> As in which way couldn't help you this? <comment99291> First part deletes items one at a time - I need to delete all. Second part deletes tracks off the PC, not off the iOS device. <comment99292> Sync again and they'll be removed <comment117118> @ted.strauss, did the resync do the trick?
