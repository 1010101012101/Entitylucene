How to remove root certificates from iOS 10? <body> How can I remove third-party root certificates under codeSettings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings/code that I've installed earlier without erasing all contents and settings from my device?  Resetting "network settings" and "all settings" doesn't do the job. I'm not asking about emulator and I don't have jailbroken device.
