How can I hide calendars from Siri? <body> When I open the Calendar app, I have some hidden calendars which I don't normally want to see.  But when I ask Siri what meetings I have, she shows me all the events. I don't need to know what my family is doing when I ask about my own meetings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TOXLom.png" alt="Screenshot of Siri" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nYj3Sm.png" alt="Screenshot of Calendar"  How can I hide some calendars from Siri?  <answer263625> Short answer: No.   No, at this moment it is not possible to hide calendars from Siri. I highly recommend you send this feedback to Apple.   A workaround would be to use a second calendar app to show the calendars of your family and use the normal calendar app only for your own calendars.   <comment330278> Unfortunately, all my calendars are with google calendar. I'll look for a work around, perhaps sharing one calendar wit another account and using that account with Calendar.app. <comment330280> There we go - I've got the google calendar app. I disabled the calendars showing with my gmail account (left mail etc enabled) and then used the iCal link to subscribe to it manually. I can't edit events, but I can always do that in google calendar. Thanks! <comment330284> Glad I could get you in the right direction :-)
