My service fails with error "WorkflowServiceRunner received error running Workflow Service". How to diagnose? <body> I'm following the instructions in the answer to emHow can I add a due date to OS X Reminders?/em , to set up a Service which creates a Reminder entry with a due date. I used Automator to create a workflow, with the single step "New Reminders Item", and saved this as code/Users/me/Library/Services/New reminder with Due.workflow/code.   When I select text, then run this Service from the app's Services menu, an alert box appears, saying:     The action "New Reminders Item" encountered an error. [Show Workflow] [OK]   The Console shows an error message like:     2017-03-18 22:36:10.084 WorkflowServiceRunner[4697]:   WorkflowServiceRunner received error running Workflow Service at   /Users/me/Library/Services/New reminder with Due.workflow: The action   “New Reminders Item” encountered an error.   I was hopeful about finding an AppleScript syntax error induced by Automator, as in SO answer to emApple Automator Applescript action giving “could not connect action” error/em, but my Workflow appears not to contain AppleScript. It appears to be a bundle directory containing files codedocument.wflow/code and codeInfo.plist/code. There was no AppleScript code that I could see.  How do I diagnose this error?  How can I find out what error the WorkflowServiceRunner received?   I am running Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11.6.
