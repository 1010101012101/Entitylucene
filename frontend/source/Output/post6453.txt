Is it possible to hide all theme related packages from Cydia? <body> Cydia is spammed by too many skinning tweaks and it is real hard to browse for more interesting applications.  Do you know a way to make Cydia hide the theme-related packages?  <answer6460> Cydia  Sections  Edit  Turn the toggle to "Off" next to the "Theme" sections.  <comment6784> Thanks, that's cool, I can filter the "noise" this way and focus on more interesting things. <comment44080> Incorrect. Themes still show in search results even when you turn all Theme sections off.
