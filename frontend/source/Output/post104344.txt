How to completely remove homebrew? <body> I am seeking for the equivalent of  precodervm implode /code/pre  In the Ruby rvm world codervm implode/code completely uninstalls everything ruby related installed via rvm, including rvm too.  Is there anything similar for homebrew? Or do I have to remove each package, then remove code/usr/local/Cellar/code and look around for any other remains that have not been dealt with automatically?  <answer104346> Use this script to uninstall homebrew completely. It's safer to run each command separately, especially the strongcd `brew --prefix`/strong to check if it suceeds.  From the homebrew FAQ:       How do I uninstall Homebrew?      If you installed to /usr/local then you can use the script in this gist to uninstall — it will only remove Homebrew and the stuff Homebrew installed leaving anything else in /usr/local alone.      Provided you haven’t put anything else in Homebrew’s prefix (brew --prefix), you can generally just rm -rf that directory. This is because Homebrew won’t touch files outside its prefix.   <comment122827> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/82807/how-to-cleanly-remove-homebrew
