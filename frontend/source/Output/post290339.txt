"Missing" iCloud storage <body> A month ago suddenly 35GB of my iCloud storage was claimed by Documentsimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CFE8z.png" alt="..." Instead of the normal 22GB which I stil can see in Finderimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KEnxX.png" alt="..."  And if I click "Manage" in System Preferences it just says unknown: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6EtW.png" alt="enter image description here"  So my question is: How can I reclaim the  "missing" GB?  Edit: Manage storage on my iPhone, documents isn't present img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KACKy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment366779> Please try checking your iCloud usage on an iPhone, apps tend to be the culprits in the documents area <comment366864> What does settingsIcloudstoragemanage storage say?    See https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204247 <comment366865> Edit at the end of the original question... <comment367623> What information does it give on the right panel when you select "Documents and Data" on the left? <comment367667> @RushilSrivastava When I click "Documents and Data" nothing happens , the text in the right side of the window still says: Select an app on the left to manage documents and data. <comment367670> @RushilSrivastava when I got back to my computer the list in "Manage" appeared like it should, but 13.2 GB is still missing... <comment367906> Interesting. What do you mean by 13.2 GB missing? Are the documents and data not accounting for the 13.2 GB? <comment367947> @RushilSrivastava  If I summarize the numbers that appeared in "manage" it's still 13.2 GB away from the 45.28GB that iOS/macOS reports I'm using. <comment367948> I know this may sound pretty simple, have you tried: logging out of iCloud account, then restarting your computer, and finally relogging back into your iCloud account? <comment367962> @RushilSrivastava I have tried that...
