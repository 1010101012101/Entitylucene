How can I change the language for dictation on the fly? <body> With English not being my first language, I usually need support for at least two languages when using features like auto-correct and dictation.  strongIs it possible to toggle the language which is used for dictation via a shortcut?/strong  As of now, I always have to manually navigate through the menus in the System Preferences which if far from convenient. I've tried to see if there are any pre-defined actions in Automator, but found none.  <answer59328> I found a thread in which the following Applescript was contained:  precodetell application "System Events" to set p to (path to frontmost application) as string tell application "System Preferences"     activate     reveal anchor "Dictation" of pane "com.apple.preference.speech" end tell tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         tell pop up button 1 of tab group 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech"             click             if (get value of attribute "AXValue") contains "English (United States)" then                 click menu item "German" of menu 1                 say "Dictation set to German"             else if (get value of attribute "AXValue") contains "German" then                 click menu item "English (United States)" of menu 1                 say "Dictation set to English"             end if         end tell     end tell end tell quit application "System Preferences" activate application p /code/pre  I tested it out and it works. All you have to do is change "German" to the language of your choice.  Additionally, may I suggest an application called FastScripts, which allows you to run the applescript either from the top menu bar or from a keyboard shortcut.  Hope this solved your problem!  <answer59335> You could either edit property lists that store the setting and reopen the DictationIM process:  precode#!/bin/bash  k="com.apple.speech.recognition.AppleSpeechRecognition.prefs DictationIMLocaleIdentifier" if [[ "$(defaults read $k)" == en-US ]]; then   defaults write $k fr-FR   defaults write com.apple.assistant "Session Language" fr-FR else   defaults write $k en-US    defaults write com.apple.assistant "Session Language" en-US fi killall -HUP DictationIM /code/pre  Or use UI scripting:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "Dictation" of pane "com.apple.preference.speech" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences"     tell pop up button 1 of tab group 1 of window 1         click         if value is "English (United States)" then             click menu item "French" of menu 1         else             click menu item "English (United States)" of menu 1         end if     end tell end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  Both scripts are copied from my answer to How to use applescript to toggle the language setting of new dictation tool (10.8) - Stack Overflow.  <answer76345> check this http://fouquet.me/apps/dictationswitcher/ is very nice. I Hope this help  <answer84054> Not sure if this helps but someone developped a "Dictation Switcher" a little utility that sits in your Mac's menu bar and makes using Dictation even easier. it can be found here: http://fouquet.me/apps/dictationswitcher/  Understand you had the pleasure to write your own script but just in case, I thought this might help...  :-)  <answer259367> On OSX El Capitan I had difficulty getting the script by user495470 to work and likewise with the code from pasawaya. I ended up modifying the code from pasawaya to include:  precoderepeat until exists tab group 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech" end repeat /code/pre  Here's the full slightly modified script which works perfectly for me:  precodetell application "System Events" to set currentWindow to (path to frontmost application) as string tell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "Dictation" of pane "com.apple.preference.speech" end tell tell application "System Events"     tell process "System Preferences"         repeat until exists tab group 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech"         end repeat         tell pop up button 1 of tab group 1 of window "Dictation &amp; Speech"             click             if (get value of attribute "AXValue") contains "English" then                 click menu item "Danish (Denmark)" of menu 1                 say "Dictation Danish"             else if (get value of attribute "AXValue") contains "Danish" then                 click menu item "English (United Kingdom)" of menu 1                 say "Dictation English"             end if         end tell     end tell end tell quit application "System Preferences" activate application currentWindow /code/pre  <comment68365> To be honest, this solution is not very beautiful (I don't like seeing the preferences being opened and all that...), but it works so I'll go with this for know. Thanks for sharing this! I'm already using FastScripts, so this is fine. <comment68371> There seems to be an error with the syntax. ",“ or "]“ expected. <comment68372> `-eq` doesn't work for string IIRC. <comment68373> You can leave out the `activate`, it will work just as well and not show the window. <comment68375> @DanielBeck You're right. I edited the scripts and also removed the `activate` from the AppleScript. <comment96755> Awesome! Thank you very much.
