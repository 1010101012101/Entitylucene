Is there any way to rename app name in lauchpad? <body> I have 3 eclipses installed on my mac eclipse jee, eclipse for android and eclipse for php. all three eclipses are cooming in launchpad with the name eclipse. Is there any way i can rename app name like  eclipse jee, eclipse php, eclipse android in launchapad?  <answer68376> You can by using an Administrator account and renaming the apps in Finder. LaunchPad will show the changed name accordingly.  There also is this app, which seems to make renaming items and other operations in LaunchPad possible. Unfortunately, it seems to be discontinued, so try it at your own risk.  Finally, if you are comfortable with SQLite databases and SQL, you could manually make the necessary changes in the LaunchPad database. I'd advise you to first back up your database before you start tinkering with it. You can use the built-in codesqlite3/code command-line client to manipulate this database. You'll want to find the appropriate records in the codeapps/code table, and update their codetitle/code field.  <answer288281> Create a symbolic link of your Launchpad app:  precodeln -s Launchpad.app Launchpad_renamed.app /code/pre  <comment79410> yeah actually that's my next question. I have a doubt if i rename the .app file, i think some features may not work. <comment79411> That shouldn't be a problem, but the easiest way to find out is test it. You can always change the name back. <comment79414> hmmmm i have renamed .app files. i will updated when i will get any prob. <comment79418> @Vivart, I added some alternative solutions if just renaming the apps does not work for you. <comment230333> Hi, I can't rename the application itself. Is there a way to rename the LaunchPad shortcut only? Are there any alternatives to the application you linked? Thank You. <comment364083> The question is about how to rename apps *on* the Launchpad, not the Launchpad app itself.
