Hide the status bar on an iPhone <body> Is it possible to hide the status bar (battery indicator, time, etc.) on an iPhone? I can't find any indication of this in settings but I can't figure out if it's just not possible or if I'm looking in the wrong place. I went into Settings and looked in General and Display.  When I search for this I keep getting StackOverflow answers about hiding (or showing) the status bar programmatically. I want to know if there's a way to do this on the device itself.  The phone I'm trying to do this on is an iPhone 5, if it matters.  <answer179199> No it's not possible to hide it on an unjailbroken iPhone.   <answer269057> Hold your power button down until the "slide to power off" option appears. Slide it halfway and keep your finger there. Wait till you get a notification and click it without lifting your finger that's holding the slide to power off switch halfway. And it's gone.   <comment212378> Is there any official documentation on this I should have been able to find or is it that I didn't find anything because the option doesn't exist? <comment212391> The option does not exist in the UI. Apps can hide the status bar, however, if designed to.
