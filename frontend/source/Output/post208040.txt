iPhone 5 Updates Frozen <body> I have an iPhone 5. I have apps that are updating but never finish. I tried restarting. I tried some examples on this website. I waited days for it to refresh. Nothing seems to work. The "Updates All" is greyed out. You can't select it. Recently upgraded to iOS9 9.0.1(13A404).  <answer208041> I would connect your phone to a computer, open iTunes and delete the apps from there that are not updating properly. Once this is done, simply unplug your phone from your computer and re-download those applications.   <answer208053> If the previous answer doesn't work re: deleting the hung apps, your next best bet would be to do a factory restore and reload from backup - it almost sounds like the upgrade partially failed.  Instructions for doing this can be found on Apple's site
