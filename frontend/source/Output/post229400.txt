How do I install OpenSSL in ElCaptain if my HomeBrew it's broken? <body> After an upgrade from 10.10 to 10.11, my rails environment was broken.  I've removed the broken open-source projects/files and now I'm trying to install HomeBrew.  But I receive this message:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" curl: (77) SSL: can't load CA certificate file /System/Library/OpenSSL/certs/cert.pem /code/pre  But to install OpenSSL, I need homebrew. So, I'm stuck.  How can I get around this issue?  <answer229406> You can curl without SSL by removing the ‘s’ from ‘https’:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  Additionally, you could just point a web browser to the page, http://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install and save the code to code/tmp/brew.rb/code as a text file and then run it  precoderuby -e /tmp/brew.rb /code/pre  <comment279854> Hi @bmike. It worked! But,when I try to install OpenSSL following [this](https://solitum.net/openssl-os-x-el-capitan-and-brew/), it returns this message: https://gist.github.com/e210f21b90db0b5e4215 <comment279855> @Cleyton Good - so there's progress. I would start a new post with brew doctor output. <comment279856> @bmike No need. I found the solution: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/32065#issuecomment-54260865 . Thanks man! <comment279857> Woah @Cleyton - I hope to live to see the day when environment variables can no longer cause this sort of pain.
