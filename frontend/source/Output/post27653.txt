How can I configure autofs with indirect map using sshfs? <body> How can I configure autofs with an indirect map using sshfs?  What I've done so far:  ul liadded code/servers auto_sshfs/code to code/etc/auto_master/code/li licreated code/etc/auto_sshfs/code with code* -fstype=sshfs &amp;://code/li liRan codesudo automount -vc/code /li /ul  I'm assuming that either I have fstype flag incorrect, in the wrong place or I some how need to let autofs know of sshfs.
