Disable simcard or phone on Verizon iPhone 4 <body> I have Verizon CDMA iPhone 4 iOS 7 jailbroken, with no simcard slot. I'm using it as an iPod, because there is no Verizon in my country and I would like it to stop looking for signal, because it's draining battery.  ul liI used Airplane mode but I want GPS to work./li liI read Is there an app to disable everything but GPS on iPhone? and I thought that taking out sim card is the best solucion, but I cant do this because there is no sim card slot./li liI thought that i can set up a SIM PIN and then just not type it and phone will have sim locked, but there is no option like that in settings. I don't know why â€” maybe it's because there is no signal?/li /ul  I would like to install some tweak which would allow me to create a pin code on this phone or disable the SIM card.  <comment139852> possible duplicate of [Is there an app to disable everything but GPS on iPhone?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6898/is-there-an-app-to-disable-everything-but-gps-on-iphone) <comment139984> Quote taken directly from the top answer on that question, "If jailbroken, SBSettings allows one to turn off everything: Data, Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G, Edge, Phone, SSH, etc. but leave GPS enabled."
