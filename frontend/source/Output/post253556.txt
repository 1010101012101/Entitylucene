Apple Siri text issue <body> When I dictate a text message to Siri and she sends it the message comes back with this code em$!!$/em . The message does not go through and this is also happening on my iPad as well.  Is this a carrier issue or an apple issue?  How do I fix it?  <comment315518> Does the message you through if you send it manually via Messages? <comment315812> Yes, no issues sending it manually through messages.  it only happens when I dictate to Siri and then tell her to send.  Now it sometimes works and some times doesn't, just a few days ago it was every time.
