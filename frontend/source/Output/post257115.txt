Move an Item from a Parent Folder to its Subfolder <body> I was wondering if anyone could help me with a script that will move a file/files from a parent folder into its subfolder.  That's it.  I have seen scripts that will move files up into their parent folders, but nothing for moving them down one peg.  Is this possible?  <answer257179> It's not perfect but the following will mostly work. Assumptions:  • The source directory is /Users/admin/Desktop/test (can be edited)  • The nested destination directory is Archive  precode#!/bin/bash  oldIFS=$IFS IFS=$(/bin/echo -en "\n\b")  dir="/Users/admin/Desktop/test"  if [ -d $dir/Archive ] ; then     for FILE in `/bin/ls $dir | /usr/bin/grep -v Archive` ; do         /bin/echo "Moving $FILE"         /bin/mv $dir/$FILE $dir/Archive/$FILE     done     else         /bin/echo "Folder $dir/Archive does not exist" fi  IFS=$oldIFS /code/pre  Note that if you have other files with "Archive" in the name they'll be skipped, too.. I'm sure there's a better way.  <answer257188> Why get complicated.  precodecd /Users/admin/Desktop/test &amp;&amp; mkdir -p Archive &amp;&amp; find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv -nv {} Archive \; /code/pre  Pros:  ul liHandles spaces, special characters, or even newlines in filenames correctly./li liExits if it can't get to the codetest/code directory./li liExits if the codeArchive/code directory doesn't exist and can't be created./li liTells you what files it's moving./li liDoesn't overwrite existing files with the same name./li liIs actually a one-liner, just broken up for readability:  precodecd /Users/admin/Desktop/test &amp;&amp; mkdir -p Archive &amp;&amp; find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv -nv {} Archive \; /code/pre/li /ul  <comment320908> Is the subfolder a predictable name, or can it vary essentially randomly? <comment320914> The subfolder is always the same name, and it resides within a folder on the Finder <comment321051> 1. [Don't parse `ls`.](http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/128985/135943)  Just never do it.  2. [Quote your shell variables.](http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/131766/135943)  3. [`printf` is better than `echo`](http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/65803/135943), particularly when you need to use escape sequences. <comment321136> WOW!  Thanks, all!  I'll work with these today and see how it goes! <comment321170> lol- I have a long way to go.. Thanks for the tips!
