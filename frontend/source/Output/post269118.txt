Now i'm having a problem as one of the user "user52842" and here https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7306485?start=0&amp;tstart=0; I can't login. I reboot multiple times (it keeps on saying wrong password), tried su &amp; and sudo, changed the password via system preferences. Also, it the user folder is not created. I have no problem creating or deleting users but i can't login to a user once created.  Thanks in advance for the help  <comment338115> So did you verify the cause is the same as "user52842"? Because rebooting multiple times, su & sudo, and changing the password will not resolve the problem described by "user52842". I can't see a consistent logic flow in your question. <comment338135> You're right, maybe the reason me and user52842 are unable to login is not the same however we still have one thing in common which is we can't login. My question is, am i doing something wrong? When i create the user thru system preferences i have no problem login. The problem only occurs when user is created thru terminal. The user does exist but he can't be access no matter what <comment338142> The script you included works ok.
