How can I revoke an applications access to keychain passwords from the command-line? <body> Applications can be granted permanent unprompted access to passwords. You can add and revoke these privileges using the Keychain Access utility.  (See this answer)  I'd like to be able to revoke from the command-line. Is this possible?  Specifically, my problem is that I'm creating a password in a shell script and storing it in the keychain using the codesecurity add-generic-password .../code command. This works fine, but because the codesecurity/code application created the password, it's automatically granted free reading privileges. I want it to prompt every time.
