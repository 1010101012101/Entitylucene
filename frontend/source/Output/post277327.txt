If you connect to a Wi-Fi network, go to Settings  Photos and verify that it says "Updated just now" or "Updated [some time recently]." If it does not say this, leave it on this page for a while and see whether it changes to some form of "Uploading."  <comment349158> It says updated at 0942, although time is now 0713. Not sure which day it is about.
