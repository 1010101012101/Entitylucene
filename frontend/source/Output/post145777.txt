I'm unable to launch Xcode 6.0.1 <body> I have downloaded the new Xcode Xcode 6.0.1 a few hours ago. But when I'm trying to launch the app, the programm bounces on my Dock during about 30 seconds. Once it stops, it seems to be not launched. But when I click on the icon, apparently I can close it, even if it is not open, as you can see on the attached screenshot.  Do you have similar problem, or it's only on my computer? Thank you for your help.  I'm working on a Mac-mini, with OS X 10.9.4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69kjl.png" alt="A screenshot of my dock"  <comment171803> Could You post Console log?

I've restarted my computer, reinstalled the application after closing all the others, and Xcode now has completed his installation. Thank you! <comment171812> Good:) next time before launching Xcode downloaded from developer.apple.com, You can remove quarantine with `xattr -c /path/to/Xcode.app`. This will also speed up first launch.
