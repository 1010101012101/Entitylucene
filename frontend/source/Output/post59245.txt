How to make the Backspace key to take me to the previous page in Safari 6? <body> kbdBackspace/kbd/kbdDelete ⌫/kbd no longer works as a back button in Safari 6.  How to make the Backspace key to take me to the previous page in Safari 6?  <answer59246> Apple removed the backspace (probably to prevent users that wanted to edit a form field to accidentally go to the previous page)  You've got a number of options:  ul liUse the kbdcommand/kbd + kbd&lt;-/kbd shortcut for back. /li liUse the 2 finger swipe gesture (push the webpage to the right)/li liInstall the BringBackDelete safari extension./li /ul  <answer59250> I actually asked a similar question (but more broad so this isn't a duplicate). I got this as an answer (it works, I tested it):  Write the below line in terminal:     defaults write com.apple.Safari com.apple.Safari.ContentPageGroupIdentifier.WebKit2BackspaceKeyNavigationEnabled -bool YES   Then restart Safari.  Hope this helps!  <answer59251> Type this into your Terminal.app:  codedefaults write com.apple.Safari NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Back" "⌫" /code  <comment68308> That would also disable the default shortcut (⌘[). <comment68326> But it would at least enable backspace, which is what OP wants. <comment68460> The hidden preference would also restore ⇧⌫ for forward.
