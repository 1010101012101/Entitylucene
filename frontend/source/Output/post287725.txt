How can I set iCloud Keychain in case if I changed a phone number? <body> I could not set up my iCloud Keychain as I changed my phone number. It seems that once you log in to your iCloud Keychain, you can change the phone number.  However, I have not logged in to the iCloud keychain yet. And all of my devices (MacBook on Sierra, iPhone 7 on iOS 11, iPad Pro on iOS 10) don't set up the iCloud keychain for the same reason.  And the problem is that I could not log in to the iCloud keychain in the first place as the phone number is the old one and I don't have any phone number any longer.  In this case, can I still log in to it even if the phone number has been changed and no device has been logged in?
