How can I install the utility program "free" on Mac OSX Sierra? <body> How do I install the program codefree/code on macOS Sierra?  codefree/code prints memory usage to the terminal like codetop/code, but it just prints out once and works nicely with codeawk/code and codesed/code.  NB: I usually just Google this type of thing, but the program's name "free" means I get hits for all sorts of alternative meanings of the word.  I've tried codebrew install coreutils/code but I don't get codefree/code or codegfree/code in my code$PATH/code.  <comment350503> Thanks!  Never would have found that on a search <comment350509> [Wikipedia - GNU Core utilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities#Capabilities) <comment350521> @klanomath, Why have you linked to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities#Capabilities in a comment? <comment350551> To show you the commands/binaries in GNU Coreutils. <comment350604> @klanomath,  Ahh, I see.  That wasn't clear without the context, but it was still a nice mic drop comment.
