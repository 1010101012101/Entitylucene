How do I make OS X say something when it finds the word "burning" in Console? <body> How do I make OS X monitor the Console and say something when it finds the word "burning" in there?  <answer249672> Use the following command:  precodesyslog -w|while read l;do [[ $l = *'burning'* ]]&amp;&amp;say the bush is on fire but was not consumed by the flames;done /code/pre  codesyslog -w/code is a shorter alternative to codetail -f /var/log/system.log/code. If you need another log use codetail -f /path/to/logfile/code instead.  <comment309780> What is the point of this? You can search the console for a keyword. <comment310124> I can, but I want to be alerted when a specific entry appears, while I'm doing something else.
