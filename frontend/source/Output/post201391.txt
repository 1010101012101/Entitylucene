How to access previous support articles? <body> I picked up an older G5 with a PowerPC for software testing. Its not booting, and I am experiencing the issues described at 3 Beep on Powermac G5 on the Apple Forums. Unfortunately, the links provided for support articles were broken by Apple's webmaster. For example, this was cited at least 5 times, and it appears to be the canonical reference for this issue on the G5:  ul lihttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=302527/li /ul  Now, here's the best part. On the new support site, there is no search box. So it appears I can't even search for it based on the previous article number.  How do I reference previous support articles on the redesigned site?  <answer201403> If you are lost on the Apple support globe and its new appearance and older forum links are leading to nowhere, the wayback machine may be helpful:  About the Power Mac G5 (Late 2005) diagnostic LEDs  This support article doesn't mention beeps but only flashes and colors.  BTW the Apple support site still features searches:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rflb1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The result is not very helpful though, despite the fact that the article is still available in the archive. I haven't been able to find it in the 100 listed results.  <answer201407> There's always archive.org's Wayback Machine. Of course, the archive doesn't necessarily have a copy the site or page you're looking for, and sometimes images and other resources are not available, but it's worth a shot.   In this case, it looks like you're in luck!   hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0Q8z.png" alt="led image chart"  hr  I'm with you, though -- Apple's support content not as well preserved as it ought to be.
