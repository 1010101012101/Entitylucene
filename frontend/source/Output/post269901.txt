How to change the current directory in a file/open requester [file-picker] by clicking an open Finder window below? <body> Years ago I've seen a great UX solution on a Mac:  ul liin a program, say, a text editor, I choose File/Open menu,/li lithe file open dialog comes up, with a default directory, e.g. Desktop,/li liI click on a Finder window, or the desktop itself, and the open dialog directory changes to the clicked window./li /ul  I found it pretty useful, because the user opens directories in Finder because he or she actually works with them, and it's trivial that he or she will open/save stuff in one of these directories.  Is there such extension out there, or my false memory is kidding with me?  <answer269905> I can imagine this to be the UX solution you've seen:  h2Favorite folders in the Finder sidebar/h2  ol liShow the sidebar. Choose strongView  Show Sidebar/strong. (If Show Sidebar is dimmed, choose View  Show Toolbar.)/li listrongAdd a folder/strong: Hold down the Command (⌘) key, then drag the item to the Favorites section./li /ol  If you don’t see the Favorites section, go to Finder  Preferences  Sidebar, then select at least one item in the section.  Is this the solution you were looking for?  hr  Original answer  To navigate to a folder in the "file/open dialog" that is already open in Finder.app do this:  (I assume that both the Finder window and the "file/open dialog" are visible on the same screen/space)  ol listrongClick and hold the folder/strong icon of the folder you want to go to and…/li liDrag the strongicon into the "file/open dialog/strong" and release the mouse./li liDone./li /ol  <answer269949> I think the app you're looking for is Default Folder Xbr It does a myriad other things, but clicking in an open Finder window on the desktop will take the dialog to it [even if not visible behind another app or window]  It will 'bookmark' folders, historically or as Favourites &amp; you can set up different sets for different apps &amp; workflows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VHS0t.png" alt="enter image description here"  Well worth the price imho; I've been using it since before they added the 'X' to the title, in OS 9 &amp; earlier. I consider it one of my 'cannot live without' utilities.br emNo affiliation, just a long-time happy user./em  Copy/paste of their Main Features section...     strongDirectory Assistant/strongbr   Access your recent, favorite, and open folders from DFX's toolbar.

I'll edit my answer in a few hours. I. The meantime: in Finder.app show the left sidebar. You'll see a section called "favorites". Drag your folders onto it. Now you can click any of your bookmarked folders to go there instantly. :)
