iphone showing strange dates in all apps <body> This issue is being faced since quite a while on my iPhone 5c since iOS 9 upgrade. All the dates wherever applicable are getting displayed are something not-in-human understandable format. I tried complete restore, waited for updates till 9.3, also have asked for apple authorized service center. None helped. They said, its not a product fault. Attaching screenshots. these screenshots are old, but the issue still presists.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n26HE.jpg" width="280"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3AE0o.jpg" width="280"   <answer245501> A quick search into your issue shows you may have your Calendar set as "Buddhist".  You can check this and change that setting by going to the Settings app - General - Language &amp; Region - Scroll down to Region Formats - Tap Calendar - Make sure it's set to Gregorian.  Try that and see if that fixes it?

Being in the US, I have Gregorian selected, with Japanese and Buddhist as options. Make sure your iPhone is set for the correct region, then select another non-Gregorian calendar format, then select Gregorian again. What happens? <comment302667> That resolved the issue.
