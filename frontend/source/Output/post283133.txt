macOS numbers formula range problem <body> I can't seem to find the equivalent of:  precodeH2:2 /code/pre  In macOS Numbers app. This statement in a formula tells that the formula should take the cells from H2 to the end of the row into consideration.  I can't set it to a constant value, since the rows are constantly increasing, so I need a dynamic value.  EDIT: This is what I was using in Google Sheets:  precode=COUNTIF(I3:3, 0) /code/pre  <answer283134> Just give the column name. This: codeSUM(H2;)/code should give you the sum of all values in column H2. You do not need to provide a range.   <answer283144> As of version version 4.1.1 (4338), unfortunately with strongNumbers/strong one can define the entire row, but not from a specific column forward.  So, while codeCOUNTIF(I3:3, 0)/code will resolve to an error, codeCOUNTIF(3:3, 0)/code will work regardless of the row's length. (Increasing columns)  Example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DoAt9.png" alt="COUNTIF(row, condition) example"  This would be a good feature suggestion for Apple.    <comment356917> I don't need values from the whole row. I need the function to count the data from a specific point of the row to its end. So doing the same for the row (SUM(h2)) won't work. <comment356918> Just to be sure I understand, the row (horizontally) or column (vertically)?  You mention increasing rows so that is what is confusing. If the rows increase That does not affect another row, increasing columns would. Would love to help if we can, please clarify perhaps with an example table. Cheers
