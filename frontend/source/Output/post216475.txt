Pages won't open a file created in pages <body> A file created in Apple's Pages won't open after it's been created: the required index.xml file is missing.  This has become a more frequent problem as seemingly more of my Pages files won't open.  However some other Pages files do open.  Why will this software create a file then later refuse to open it?  I have a 2009 iMac, OS Yosemite 10.10.5.   <comment261607> How many versions of Pages do you have? One in Applications & also one in Applications/iWork? <comment262214> Thanks for responding. Wow!  If I open Pages from the dock I have  Pages '09 v 4.1.  If I open a document in Finder, that is if I can open a document in Finder - I still have at least one I know that works - I have Pages v 5.6.1.  What's that about?  I don't believe I have iWork. <comment262224> Was what I suspected, you have 2 versions. The older one presumably is having difficulty opening documents saved by the later one. 5.6.1 is current, 4.1 is well out of date [even for a v4] Pretty sure the fix is going to be find the old one & trash it [or at least compress it just in case, then trash the original] You might look for doubled versions of Keynote & Numbers too. <comment262445> Thank you for your help with this.  I will see if I can figure out how to delete the older version while keeping the newer.  Here's hoping the newer version will open all of my documents.
