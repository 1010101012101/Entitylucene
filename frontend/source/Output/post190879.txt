What is "sperion"? <body> I'm cleaning up my boot drive &amp; have come across a unix executable file located @ /private/tmp/sperion about which I can't seem to find any information at all. What is "sperion"?   This may be an unrelated question/problem but that private folder sperion is in img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYxYe.png" alt="/private/tmp/sperion"is visible &amp; I am consistently told that I do not have permission to chflags it hidden even with myself listed as having full permissions over the folder and the drive.  <answer190889> It's a part of the software licensing service,  Nalperion  Unless you know what app you have that  uses it for licensing, then maybe the simplest way to find out would be to kill the Nalperion service from Activity Monitor &amp; wait til one app complains.   <comment227247> Thank you! I had Color Efex Pro 4 installed, which uses Nalperion for "security". I removed all of it.
