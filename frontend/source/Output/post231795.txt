Pitched song from Garageband not the same on iPhone <body> I have changed the pitch of a song i Garageband and shared it with iTunes on my macbook, where it sounds "perfect".  I have put the song on the iCloud Library to listen to it on my runninglist (cloud playlist) - but it is no longer the pitched version of the song but the original song that's playing.  How do i fix this?
