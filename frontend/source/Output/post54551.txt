Is there any way to view saved wifi passwords on the iPhone? <body> I've previously connected to a wifi network on my iPhone but I've no way of finding out the password. So is there any way to view saved wifi passwords on the iPhone?  <answer54565> If you have a jailbroken iPhone, check out Wifi Passwords on Cydia.  <answer54572> Unfortunately, on the iPhone it is not possible to access this information.  The passwords are kept on your phone in a safe place that is not accessible through any regular means on the phone.  This is done for your protection, if you were to lose your iPhone and someone picked it up, the passwords that are stored on it would be up for grabs.  This would lead to a lot of security problems.    I would recommend apps like 1password or the many other pieces of software out there that do the same thing to keep your passwords safe and backed up. I have way to many passwords to remember and it has been a life saver.  1Password even has the ability to back up your passwords to dropbox just in case something happens to your phone and you need to access it from somewhere else.  There are a lot of different password managing apps out there, just find the right one for you.    As gtm above me stated, there is a way to access your passwords but it is through jailbreaking. I do not recommend jailbreaking, that is something that you have to make the decision on for yourself. Jailbreaking is not for everyone.  I know this may not have been the answer you were looking for, we have all been there when we forget a password and there isn't a way to retrieve it.  The easier thing you can do is just reset the password on your router and make sure to keep that password safe.  I hope this answer helps somewhat.  <answer106042> 1) If you have a Mac connected to the same network, you can find the stored password in it's Keychain using the codeKeychain Access/code app (link)  2) If the router is an Apple Airport based device, you may be able to log straight into it via Airport Utility (available on Mac and iOS) to see the password at source  3) If you are on iOS7, then you can use iCloud Keychain Syncing to allow the stored password on your iPad to be synced elsewhere (assuming you have a Mac too), allowing you to then read it in your Keychain as per point 1.  In the screenshot shown, most of these  WiFi networks are in other cities that only my iPhone has connected to:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eiS2F.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer202585> as answered by stuffe, one of the possibilities is to use keychain syncing.   there are 2 requirements  ol liphone must have the wifi password already/li licomputer must be able to access the internet/li /ol  if your iPhone is able to use "personal hotspot", then you can do this:  ol liturn on personal hotspot/li liconnect computer to personal hotspot - this will initiate the keychain sync, which will then populate the key/password in the app/li liturn off personal hotspot/li liconnect to the wifi with the new populated key/password /li /ol  <answer229424> Using the Keychain app is a great way to organize your passwords. With Keychain you can access all passwords (including Wi-Fi passwords) from your Mac. But the Jailbreak tweak WiFi Passwords from Cydia is the best one for viewing passwords directly on your iPhone.  You just need to open the App and you can see all wifi passwords that are stored in your iPhone. Then you can share the passwords with your friends in public places. That's cool app.  Credits: http://www.unlockboot.com/2016/02/how-to-view-saved-wifi-passwords-on.html  <answer290430> As of iOS 11 (beta) it seems that it is possible to request the password from another device via bluetooth.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rSYZA.png" alt="Request access"  <comment81288> Wifi password works for me on 3gs with iso 4.1 <comment145296> On 3): does Mavericks actually allow that? [The support article on iCloud Keychain](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4644) has no mention of wifi passwords. <comment145297> Yup, my iCloud Keychain on my Mac is full of WiFi passwords (or "AirPort network password"s) from other people's homes where I have connected my iPhone in the past, and from where I certainly have not taken my iMac :) <comment157907> Working on iPad, iOS 6.1.2 <comment166278> While protecting passwords in general is a good thing, I think many would agree with me that the benefit of being able to view wifi passwords outweighs the security "risks" of these being discovered by someone who steals your phone. Maybe I'm wrong. <comment166279> @chaiguy I agree completely, there should be a way to do this. On an Apple computer in OSX it is possible because you can go to your keychain, authenticate yourself with your admin password and view your passwords that are saved. But since iOS doesn't make a user set a password for their user account so it isn't possible to keep that data safe and still viewable at the same time. I was just trying to be more informative than just saying "No, there isn't. (Unless you jailbreak)". Because in short, there isn't a way, on just the iPhone itself (without Jailbreak) to view saved wifi pass codes. <comment212984> Excellent tip, thanks! Working on iPhone 4 with iOS 7.1.2. <comment263228> It is not a security feature, otherwise being able to check your Safari passwords on the phone (after authentication) would be a complete security bug. <comment312185> simple and functional if you are indeed jailbroken. tks.
