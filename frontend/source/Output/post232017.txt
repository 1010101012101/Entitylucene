I have El Capitan and can not install a DMG file <body> I get an error message that says:     Warning. The following disk images couldn't be opened.br   Image Reason SurveillanceClient.dmg invalid checksum   Does anyone have ideas on how to install this file?  <answer232018> In this YouTube video, they teach you how to fix this. Anyway, after El Capitan, Disk Utility has been completely changed, so now, in order to disable the checksum verification, you can just open a Terminal window and type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.frameworks.diskimages skip-verify -bool true /code/pre  Then open again your .dmg. Now it should work.  <comment283434> You need to check that the download has not corrupted the file - a good site should have a checksum allowing you to check this <comment283436> But you should not disable the checksum check - without knowing why it was corrupted first - do you want a Trojan? <comment283440> Ok i got the file to mount and the installation to open but at the end of the install it says Instillation Failed , the Installer encountered an error that caused the installation to fail. Contact software manufacturer for assistance. I contacted them and they swear it's apples fault. Any ideas? <comment283444> Open Disc Utility  Images  Verify  Select your .dmg file. What's the result of this operation? <comment283448> Operation failed with status 116
