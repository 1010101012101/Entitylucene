External USB drive partitions not mounted or mounted readonly <body> On my MacOS Sierra I use a Maxtor M3 1TB USB 3.0 external drive, the drive contains two HFS partitions and it is always plugged to the macmini. In the last three years the disk worked very well but in the last months sometimes the partitions aren't mounted or only one is mounted or worse they are mounted read-only. From the disk util application I can reactivate the partitions and everything start working again but this behaviour is very strange.  The problem occurs randomly so I can't understand how to fix it, any idea?  <comment357017> *Total guess, with no data to back me up* - the thermal calibration is out; so it works when hot but not cold [or vice versa]. I have no clue how to fix that; I've always considered it time to change the drive. <comment357020> Thanks for your hint, maybe it's the time to buy an external SSD
