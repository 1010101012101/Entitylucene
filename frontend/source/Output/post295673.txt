Sometimes when I right (ctrl) click on a file icon I get a the spinning beachball <body> which is telling me my finder has hung (again).  It wont relaunch from the task bar. In fact relaunching from the icon on the task bar makes everything disappear including all desktop icons. It will not always restart from the Apple menu so usually restart using codesudo shutdown -r now/code.  BUT even while the ball is spinning I can launch and quit apps, open and close files from with those apps and do virtually every task that does not need the Finder.  This has been going on for some time. I have re-installed 10.11.6 (15G1510) - 2 x 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon.  So far I not found a common repeatable action that will make it happen.   Sometimes it will happen as soon as I cold start other times I can work for a couple of hours before. I seems to take longer to re-occur after have restarted using the terminal command.   Update:  Its a MacPro (Early 2009) with ATI Radeon HD 5770 1024 MB and 2 displays, 32gig RAM. OS is on a OWC Mercury Accelsior PCIe 480Gb SSD: I did a clean install but not on a reformatted drive.   I did not bother with this info 1st time around as I felt this is a fairly generic problem relating to a preference file that has become corrupt but which and where is the $1M question?  <comment373426> There's lots of details missing from here like what model Mac Pro, how much memory, if you did a clean-install or simply restore from a backup.  What error messages, if any are you seeing in `/var/log/system.log`?   Please understand that this question reads like "My check engine light sometimes comes on when I drive.  Sometimes after a cold start and sometimes after driving. I restart the car to fix it.  What are your thoughts?"  without telling us the car, the configuration, or any other relevant specifics. <comment373480> What are you seeing in /var/log/system.log; especially around the time the crash  happens.  Is there any error messages?  Have you tried running [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201257).  Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected.  You may need Disk 2 of the Installer disk. <comment373529> "AC adapter" on a Mac Pro? <comment373665> It's just happened again: Essentially I cannot either ctrl or right click on an icon without losing the finder: Console[2465]: Failed to connect (_consoleX) outlet from (NSApplication) to (ConsoleX): missing setter or instance variable
