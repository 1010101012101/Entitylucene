Broken icon in iOS <body> I have installed the Outlook app in my iPad mini and after some update the icon doesn't display correctly. Right now it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R99fM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Is there any way of solving this without waiting for another update or reinstalling the app?  <answer231591> Your best bet is to delete it. I would then shut down and then power the phone back up. Then re-download it from the App Store.  As iPhones run what is essentially a "simplified" version of OS X there are lot less options when it comes to troubleshooting as you don't really have ready access to the underpinnings of IOS the way you do OS X.  <comment282805> Probably not, but let's hear what the rest of the community has to say. BTW, IMO Outlook is not very good. <comment282839> Depends what you want it for... IMO, it's a better Gmail client than the Gmail app.
