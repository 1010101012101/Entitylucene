How to restore the Mavericks version of the sound effect for the volume button for Yosemite? <body> I just upgraded my MacBook to Yosemite, and the new sound effect for the volume button is just awful. Is there a way to change out the sound file so I can hear the old version on Yosemite?  <answer153617> It can be done, although you need to find the Mavericks volume feedback sound file. The filename is "volume.aiff" and (for both Mavericks and Yosemite) it is located in: /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources  Find the Mavericks volume feedback sound file and put it on your Desktop for easy access.  Open the Terminal and navigate to the folder containing the sound file:  precodecd /System/Library/LoginPlugins/BezelServices.loginPlugin/Contents/Resources /code/pre  Create a backup of the original file in case you want to reverse the changes:  precodesudo cp volume.aiff volume.aiff.bak /code/pre  Provide the password when prompted.  Now copy in the Mavericks sound file placed on your Desktop:  precodesudo cp ~/Desktop/volume.aiff ./ /code/pre  Restart  <answer288031> This works perfectly AFTER you boot into recovery (by holding kbdCMD/kbd+kbdR/kbd at boot up).  From there open Terminal (under the Utilities menu) and enter codecsrutil disable/code (to disable System Integrity Protection).   Once you do that there are no issues though I would recommend you repeat the above process when done and enter codecsrutil enable/code into Terminal to enable System Integrity Protection.  <comment180804> possible duplicate of [Where is the OS X Volume Change Feedback Sound File located?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151068/where-is-the-os-x-volume-change-feedback-sound-file-located) <comment180805> This allows me to find the new sound, do you have any idea where i can find the old one in order to replace it ? <comment180806> See if you can find someone who hasn't updated yet; it's in the same place. Note that no-one yet has reported swapping it back actually works, but it's quite possibly a case of replacing one with the other. <comment180809> @Rogue here's the `volume.aiff` file from Mavericks:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13617105/volume.aiff <comment247129> The Dropbox link to obtain the old Maverick Volume sound file does not; probably expired. Here is a fresh link where to obtain the file to replace the new sound file you might not like (like me!): http://forums.macrumors.com/attachments/volume-aiff-zip.487154/ <comment288151> Tried this on El Capitan (with sudo) and still got:  `cp: volume.aiff.bak: Operation not permitted`
