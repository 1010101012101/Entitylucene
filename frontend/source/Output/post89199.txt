Select statements in Apple Numbers '09 <body> I've got a table as follows  precode| Name       | Year  | Price | |____________|_______|_______| | Foo        | 2013  | $10   | | Bar        | 2009  | $3    | | Baz        | 2010  | $100  | /code/pre  What I'd really like to be able to do is a codeselect * from table where [Year] &lt;= CurrentYear/code  Since this is a spreadsheet and not a database, I'm wondering if there's any way to do this? Is there any way to do select statements in Numbers '09?  <answer89201> No SQL or database connections plug into a Numbers file, so you would need to export it and get the data into a SQLite database on the filesystem or otherwise get it into something that has SQL query.  <comment252246> Good question to ask oneself: How would I do this in Excel?  Perhaps an INDEX(Match) type of query.  It appears that you want to return the entire record? (each field)
