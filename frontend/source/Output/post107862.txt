FileVault2 effect on speeds <body> I would like to know what kind of speed implications using FileVault2 would have on my MBPr (late 2013). As there are much faster SSD's in these machines I want to know whether there is a noticeable speed difference compared older generations.  <answer107878> I've used FileVault 2 on my mid - 2012 retina MBPro. It's been awhile since I activated FileVault 2, but I've seen little to no real performance hit once I activated FV2.  There are some more objective tests available such as here.  <answer107880> I have a 512GB Apple SSD in late-2011 MBP (custom order). I do not have benchmarks but I did not notice any visible slow downs.
