How to disable Macbook Pro internal display when using external monitors <body> I have a Late 2011 Macbook Pro 13" (running Lion - OS 10.7.4) which I use with a dual external monitor setup. I have two 21" LCDs that I use as external monitors. One uses the built in Mini Display Port on the Macbook Pro and the other is connected via a USB to DVI adapter (Diamond DVILink).  The problem I am having is with the 13" built in display of the Macbook Pro. I would like it to remain closed and unused (I prefer the dual monitors at same resolution), however I cannot seem to "disable" the display in the display preferences applet. So even though the Macbook Pro lid is closed the operating system still makes use of the display, even though the apple logo on the back of the display is unlit. I have tried to move the laptop screen off out of the way in display preferences but I find when I "sleep" my setup that any applications that remain open move to the laptop screen. This makes it difficult to locate the application windows when resuming from sleep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wl6mv.png" alt="Display Preferences"  Does anyone know of a way to disable the laptop built in display so it is not seen by the OS when external monitors are being used?  <answer56841> You should be able to close the lid and use an USB mouse/keyboard to awaken the computer to only use the external display.  The interesting thing here, is that you use an USB-graphcis adapter too.  That software may confuse this process.  I would suggest just using the native graphics ports to begin with and see if you can make it work, and then add the USB-adapter.  <answer56926> On 10.6 an earlier, the internal display stayed disabled even after opening the lid. There's a firmware variable that restores that behavior:  precodesudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0" /code/pre  I don't know if it would help in this case though. You don't have to reboot when changing display configurations.  <answer87394> I use a very naive solution on a Macbook Air mid-2012: instead of using clamshell mode (closing the lid), I just press the brighness down button until the lowest level. For my surprise, the lowest level turns off the internal display. I don't know if this works for others models, but it works well for me.  <answer161541> Turning the brightness down as suggested above turns the monitor off on my MacBook Pro - mid 2014 model. Keeping the lid open allows better dissipation of heat and keeps the fan noise to a minimum so this is my preferred mode of working.  <answer188647> I have Mac book Pro Retina 13 late 2013 and turning brightness down to the end made my lid off with two external monitors connected one via hdmi another one via thunderbolt port. As @Mikey said closing lid and using external monitors can cause serious heat problem for lap top it's true and i asked apple support directly for making sure. it's better to let it be open and using external monitors.  <answer194336> There's a tool that allows you to disable internal display: https://github.com/Eun/DisableMonitor.  I've been using it with success in the same scenario.  Disclaimer: I'm not a maintainer, so I fear I won't be able to provide support in case of any problems. Please use github issues.  <comment65273> Have you installed any software that could keep the display from sleeping? <comment65274> No I haven't. Also, the display does "appear" to be sleeping as the backlit Apple logo is turned off on the back of the lid. <comment65275> Just to clarify .. I do have the lid of the Macbook Pro closed. <comment65276> You may have to remove the DisplayLink software initially. <comment65363> The Apple logo on the back is lit by the same light that lights the display on the front; no light from the Apple logo just means that the light is off, same as if you turned the brightness all the way down (to off). It does not indicate display sleep, as the display can (and does) continue to update while the light is off. <comment65656> Perhaps your right about the DisplayLink software. I may have to save for a Macbook Pro with Multiple Thunderbird and/or HDMI ports. <comment65685> Do some experiments before jumping to conclusions <comment68228> How does one disable the internal display when the lid is closed? <comment68230> I have seen this in other posts but really did not want to have to reboot the computer each time when switching between external display and internal only display. Perhaps I am wrong, but shouldn't there be a way to disable the internal display completely when an external monitor is attached? <comment68304> That should be the default behavior, but something's wrong in your case. Have you already tried uninstalling the DisplayLink software? Or connecting the laptop to other external displays to see if it's specific to your current displays? <comment68464> According to a [comment in a related question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41345/closing-lid-for-clamshell-doesnt-make-external-monitor-primary-under-10-7-3-on#comment46946_41393) the issue might be fixed in Mountain Lion. <comment82367> Confirmed working with latest Macbook Air (June, 2012). To zap the NVRAM next boot press: CMD-OPT-P-R or reset with  "sudo nvram -d boot-args". <comment102145> Without closing the lid? No. You can break the internal screen to force the laptop not use it though. LOL <comment355007> This turns off the built-in display, but does not prevent the cursor from wandering off into it. Does "clamshell mode" prevent that?
