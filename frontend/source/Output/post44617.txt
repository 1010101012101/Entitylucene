Change to an different keyboard layout when entering passwords <body> I've just bought the Ipad 2, all my existing passwords that I need to use (mails web services etc) are in Arabic characters.  I have added the Arabic Keyboard and am able to use it in normal text fields, but I cannot switch to it when I try to type into a password field.  If I already have the Arabic keyboard selected when typing a username, it switches back to the normal keyboard when I move to the password field.  Because of this I am unable to log into anything which uses an Arabic password.  I tried with Safari and Opera Mini browser.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer44618> Have you tried hitting this key?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iMIIq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Or you can try this free app which will allow you to use an Arabic keyboard on your iPad.  strongEDIT:/strongbr Here is a great walk trough on how to do this...  <answer44638> I can see that this is likely to be very restrictive until you find a solution, so I offer this workaround to ease things while other answers come in.  If you enter your password into your username field, then select it, copy it, and type over the top with your actual user name, you can then paste the password into the password field..  This is 3 extra taps overall, but will at least allow you to use your logins in the meantime.  <comment50716> the key doesn't show up when typing a password, this is the problem <comment50717> Have you selected multiple languages in Settings  Keyboard  International (I'm not 100% of the naming since I don't have an English iDevice with me at the moment) <comment50718> I have already the Arabic keyboard layout on the system, I'm using Ipad2 so no need to this app in my case <comment50719> Yes i have both English and Arabic keyboards added <comment50720> And you don't see a global key next to your space bar? <comment50721> yes ! just in the password fields <comment50722> So, every time you would like to enter a password, the keyboard switches back to English? <comment50724> exactly, even if i typed on the other fields with the Arabic layout <comment50738> My guess is that due to the calligraphic nature of Arabic text, it's hard for the system to decide exactly what constitutes a "character" for the hiding-passwords-with-bullets feature. However, the more I think about that, the less likely it seems! <comment50780> @Michiel  Do YOU see the globe key when you are in a password field?
