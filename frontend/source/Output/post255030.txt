How do I move an app entirely from an iPod to an iPhone <body> I have a game I wanted to play on a different device, my new iPhone, but it isn't that new and I already have too much stuff on it to even reset it.  How do I move that app? And remember, no resetting.  <answer255032> You can download the app again from the App Store under the Updates tab  Purchased and searching for its name.  Your data/progress in the app will not transfer unless:  ul liIt uses iCloud for data storage and you are signed in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on both devices, or it uses a developer-specific way of syncing to a cloud service/li liYou backup the iPod, reset the iPhone to factory settings and restore the backup/li /ul  Otherwise, your progress in the game will be lost. There is no way to transfer data for a single app between devices.
