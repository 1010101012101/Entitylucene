QuickLook generator for markdown only recognises *.markdown <body> I have started using markdown for simple texts, writing in TextWrangler. I am quite happy to use Finder and QuickLook to preview the file and have installed the QLMarkdown.qlgenerator but it only works with files using the codemarkdown/code extension. The codeInfo.plist/code indicates that it should work with codemdown/code, codemd/code, `text and more.  Does anyone know how to get QuickLook working?   <answer158450> The installation instructions say to run codeqlmanage -r/code in Terminal if it doesn't automatically start working. I just installed and didn't have to.  <comment139977> I got this as a different fork and it works with .md for me. http://mdk.org.pl/2009/2/10/quicklook-for-markdown  Did you restart or logout? I think I had to at least logout/in for it to recognize .md <comment139985> The version linked to above is older by some years but I tried it anyway. I logged out etc but no joy.
