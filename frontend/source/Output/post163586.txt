How to print on a Yosemite managed printer from a Panther Mac? <body> A couple I know have two computers I'm supporting - one is a iMac which I recently upgraded from Snow Leopard (10.6) to Yosemite (10.10).  The printer is attached to this machine.  The other computer, unfortunately, is a 450MHz Power Mac G4 (AGP graphics) running the last version of Panther (10.3.9).  Surprisingly, the 14-year-old computer still works and is actively being used (primarily for AppleWorks documents, which is another "ugh").  Before the iMac was upgraded, I had done emsomething/em to it which let the Power Mac see the shared printer.  I suspect it had to do with CUPS, but I could be wrong.  Ever since the upgrade to Yosemite, the Power Mac has been unable to print, and I can't seem to recreate the old setup.  My question resumed in one sentence is:  strongHow do I share a printer emfrom/em a Mac running Yosemite emto/em one running Panther, so that the Panther one can print?/strong    <answer193328> For clarity I will name your Power Mac G4 running Panther: codePant/code and your iMac running Yosemite: codeYose/code.  codeYosemite/code has problem to print in an IPv4 environment (see: How to make shared printing works on Yosemite within an IPv4 only network?. On the other hand codePanther/code is able to run codeIPv6/code.  h2Check IPv6/h2  Hence the 1rst point to check to be able to print from codePant/code is that Ipv6 is up and running. If codePant/code and codeYose/code are connected through Ethernet, you will check this with (this is a command to enter within codeTerminal/code):  precodeifconfig en0 /code/pre  and you should get an output containing a line starting as:  precodeinet6 fe80:: /code/pre  Which prooves that codePant/code has an IPv6 address and is IPv6 connected. If they are connected through AirPort, you have to check the same output with:  precodeifconfig en1 /code/pre  If codePant/code doesn't have an IPv6 address, you will have to modify its network configuration through:  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Network /code/pre  select codeAdvanced.../code and under the codeTCP/IP/code window, select  precodeConfigure IPv6: Automatically /code/pre  Click kbdOK/kbd, kbdApply/kbd. Check that IPv6 is now up and running.  h2Check cupsd/h2  If you just enabled IPv6 for the 1st time on codePant/code then you will have to restart codecupsd/code so that it will be able to talk this protocol.  The easiest way is to simply restart codePant/code. (But if you prefer to understand what you modify clearly, to restart codecupsd/code is sufficient).  You will now have to check that codecupsd/code is able to talk IPv6. (If I would had a Panther running Mac at hand I would have answered directly, but I don't).  Here are the command to type within codeTerminal/code to perform this checking:  precodeps ax | egrep '[ /](PID|cupsd)' /code/pre  will display you 2 lines as:  precode  PID   TT  STAT      TIME COMMAND 76864   ??  Ss     0:00.26 /usr/sbin/cupsd -l /code/pre  where the number codePID/code is the proces id of the codecupsd/code daemon.  Use this process id (here 76864) to check if this daemon is talking IPv6 through the help of codelsof/code as follows:  precode/usr/bin/sudo lsof -p 76864 | egrep '(COMMAND|IPv)' /code/pre  This is a priviledged command, hence you have to use codesudo/code which will ask you your user password. This command should give you an output very similar to:  pre COMMAND   PID USER   FD     TYPE             DEVICE  SIZE/OFF      NODE NAME cupsd   76864 root    9u    IPv4 0x9007abdfc3bf58ad       0t0       TCP localhost:ipp (LISTEN) cupsd   76864 root   15u    IPv6 0x9007abdfb88bf0cd       0t0       TCP localhost:ipp (LISTEN) /pre  If you have a line where codeTYPE/code == codeIPv6/code then the codecupsd/code on codePant/code is talking IPv6.  h2Restart the sharing/h2  If you just enabled IPv6 for the 1st time on codePant/code then you will have to enable from fresh the sharing on codeYose/code so that codePant/code will see it correctly through the IPv6 channel.  On codeYose/code open  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Sharing /code/pre  stop codePrinter Sharing/code, wait for codePrinter Sharing: Off/code to display, and restart it.  On codePant/code add a new printer, and you should see a new one to add and configure on codeYose/code.  h2Disclaimer/h2  This is a blind receipe (I don't have a Panther to fully check it). I tried to avoid at most dangerous modifications on MacOS.  Any feedback would be appreciated to improve this draft answer.  <comment191586> both need Bonjour/Rendezvous running. Yosemite needs discoveryd to not be blocked on the firewall. <comment191601> I would assume that turning on printer sharing would take care of that.  Am I wrong? <comment191624> Enabling Printer Sharing and sharing the printer - System Prefs-Sharing, and System Prefs- Print & Scan, respectively - on the iMac should let the G4 see and use the printer. CUPS would provide the driver if you don't have the printer-specific driver installed on either machine. <comment193572> @douggro - Update: I tried exactly that and even with the printer driver installed, it couldn't see it.  I was just going to "Add Printer" from the printer menu, which seemed like the correct place.  Any other suggestions? <comment193639> Yes, you may have to go that route, i.e. adding the printer manually. The Bonjour shared printer auto-discovery was added in Leopard or Snow Leopard (can't remember which - I know it works in SnowLep) <comment229887> Did you find a way to solve this problem? <comment229890> I hit a ≠ problem but which might help to figure out a more general problem. I have a network conf. described in this question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/188399/22003 . `Alice` & `Bob` were both running Mountain lion (10.8) and `Printer Sharing` was used. Since I upgraded Bob to Yosemite (10.10) `Printer Sharing` is not anymore working. Since I am hunting the origin of the problem. <comment229891> Could you add the output of `ifconfig en1` on your Panther Mac? I am now convinced that `Bonjour` is broken on Yosemite above IPv4, and pretty sure that Panther doesn't talk IPv6. <comment229967> @danielAzuelos - Sorry, I never did get it working.  I'll give it a try the next time I'm over their house and add the output.
