Is there any way to change the output filename for qlmanage? <body> Is there any way to specify the output filename and directory that qlmanage uses?  We are using codeqlmanage/code to convert word documents to HTML, and it writes codePreview.html/code to its temp directory.  You can specify the output directory with code-o/code, so right now we create a new directory for each file we write, which works fine, but... not optimal.    No mention of such a facility in the command line options, but i thought i'd ask in case there is some undocumented trick.  thanks,  ian.  <answer13350> You can use codetextutil/code to convert Word documents to HTML and specify the output filename; it uses a different converter, though, which may not be acceptable for your uses.  With regard to codeqlmanage/code, you're abusing Quick Look here already.  The output is a directory, not a file, which is only designed for Quick Look to consume.  That codePreview.html/code is a fixed filename is by design; otherwise the Quick Look displayer wouldn't know where to start.  That you're able to extract the HTML output yourself is a nice side effect, nothing more.  <comment14090> Thanks Nicholas, that is what i expected, but thought i'd ask.  The quality of the HTML that qlmanage creates is pretty excellent, do you know if textutil uses the same libraries? <comment14091> Nope (I addressed this in my the first sentence of my response).  Apple has 3 different Office importers/exporters: the doc/docx I/O in Cocoa Text (which is what textutil uses), the iWork importers/exporters (*Compatibility.framework, which you'll find in the bundles of each iWork app), and the Quick Look/iOS previewers (the private OfficeImport.framework).  The latter two share quite a bit of code, and tend to be more robust/capable because they support the iWork feature set rather than just that of Cocoa Text. <comment14092> Ok, thanks for your expertise!
