Yosemite Finder Column View Modified Timestamp <body> Upon updating to Yosemite, My finder column view preview window displays the Modified and Last Opened options as "Today" or "Yesterday" etc. I need to see emwhat time/em yesterday in the column view without the extra step of having to Get File Info. Is there a way to get an actual timestamp to display in the column view? I see no option in settings for this.  <answer158274> I see now that enlarging the preview area allows room for the timestamp to show.   <answer158277> If you select "Show View Options" in the Finder (codeView -&gt; Show View Options/code or kbdCmd/kbd+kbdJ/kbd) and look towards the bottom, there is an option codeUse relative dates/code. Uncheck this.
