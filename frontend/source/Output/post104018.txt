Why is the Xcode icon red? <body> Today I noticed a very odd thing: the Xcode app icon on my system has changed to red. It seems really odd as the entire icon is the same, just that the color is red!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nOjWo.png" alt="Red Xcode App Icon"  <comment122497> Did you follow the tips given at http://www.reigndesign.com/blog/how-to-add-a-custom-dock-icon-to-xcode-to-distinguish-multiple-versions/ or perhaps download a copy from someone who did?  The icon looks exactly like the sample at http://skelimon.tumblr.com <comment122498> What version of OS X are you running? Might be relevant. <comment122499> @AlanShutko - I didn't do anything like this <comment122500> @ChristianCorrea - I am on 10.8.5, I just updated the SMC update yesterday before that it seemed fine. <comment122503> Does clicking on the icon launches the app? Have you tried removing the dock icon and re-adding it? <comment122506> I tried to remove it and place it back again, still the same. I checked in the Application folder and it's still the same, So it's not just on the dock <comment122520> Turns out that it was a prank by a coworker, I will be removing the question!
