Resizing Macintosh HD partition to use free space <body> I recently deleted a partition and have 60GB of free space. I would like for my main partition to use that, but whenever I go to resize it, I get the error "You canâ€™t perform this resize unless it has a booter". img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KEcQW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer176895> This Ask Different post has what you're looking for. Don't go looking for an "answer," the author for some reason decided to write his own answer in the "question" post. The method worked perfectly (and non-destructively, but you should always take a backup anyway, just in case) for me!   Paraphrased:     ol   liReboot in Recovery Mode by holding down Command-R as your Mac starts up./li   liOpen Terminal (from the Utilities section of the Menu Bar)./li   liRun the command, codediskutil cs list/code/li   liTake the Logical Volume ID (a long string of letters and numbers) 10 lines up from the bottom of that command's output, and use it in the command:      codediskutil cs revert [Logical Volume ID]/code/li   liThis should convert the CoreStorage Logical Volume to a normal disk partition./li   liRun codediskutil cs list/code again, and you should receive a "No CoreStorage logical volume groups found" message./li   liNow you should be able to resize your partition normally through Disk Utility./li   /ol   Good luck!  <comment261013> wow it worked like a charm <comment283429> Thanks thanks thanks man, this message saved me :)
