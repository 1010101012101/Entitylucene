App Store Keeps Pushing The Same Updates <body> I've got the following apps installed:  Text Wrangler 4.5.12 XCode 6.1.1 Microsoft Remote Desktop 8.0.12  I've installed the updates no less than 7 times in total in an attempt to get rid of this and it's still trying to push the same versions on me.  I was hoping that the recent OS X NTP Security Update would have fixed this (I was thinking that the date issue might be the cause) but these updates have just appeared again.  What can I do to stop this ridiculous situation?  <comment220305> I am having the same issue, have you ever found a solution? I think it updates but fails to mark them as updated somehow. My updates are for Skitch, Telegram, iMovie, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, Xcode, Cobook and I checked all of them, they seem to be up to date. <comment220342> I uninstalled the apps completely and started again.
