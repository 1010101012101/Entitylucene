How to add the function to change the colour of a cell on numbers after a certain date has been passed <body> I am using Numbers on Mac and I am trying to get cells to change colour once a date has been passed, this is to keep track of warranty's of certain products, I want the cells to be green while the date in the cell is a future date and then change the red once the date in the cell has passed the current date.  How do I do this?  <answer268063> This is a good use for strongConditional Highlighting/strong.  ul liSelect the cells that contain your date values./li liIn the strongInspector/strong select the strongCell/strong tab/li liWith all the cells still selected, click the strongConditional Highlighting.../strong button./li liYou will select strongAdd a Rule.../strong/li liAdd rule emDate is before.../em Date is before the date 1 days ago | Red Fill./li liAdd rule emDate is after.../em Date is after the date 0 days from now | Green Fill./li /ul  Experiment with custom styles to get the look you want.  This could also be expanded with additional rules to fine tune.  For example changing the colour to Yellow if the warranty expires in the next 2 months.  For further information on how to use strongConditional Formatting/strong check out Apple's Support Documentation.  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNEGQ.png" alt="Table with cells formatted to show dates past and future" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cbrc5.png" alt="Conditional Formatting Rules"
