See all Apple Hidden Files <body> I came from Windows 2 years ago and I knew there were hidden files in all OS's. As Windows has the simple option to show them to you, I supposed that if I contacted Apple support they would tell me how to show hidden files. But they simply told me they didn't exist at Mac OS. So I had to find the answer myself.  But today I was browsing some files with the terminal, I did codels -l -a/code to see all files (including those hidden) in a list and I saw kind of a different file that began with a dot and an underscore (code._/code). I could see in the Finder all files except that one.   So my question is: strongWhy can't I see that file (e.g. code._hello/code) in the Finder if I have already configured it to show me all files, including the hidden ones?/strong Is that another kind of hidden file which I'm not aware of?   <answer143897> There are 2 kinds of hidden files on codeOS X/code.  Files starting with code./code are normally hidden in Unix (including OS X) or Linux systems, but can easily be shown e.g. by codels -la/code.  In addition certain files (or directories) are hidden by OS X apps ( code~/Library/code is one example) and generally files inside codebundles/code (such as .apps) are not normally visible.  It is easy to show hidden files in Finder (by changing settings codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE/code). This then applies to all files.  Finder addons such as codeTotalFinder/code make changing this easier and Finder alternatives such as QuollEyeTree http://binnie.id.au/QuollEyeTree.html let you toggle this for individual directories and show both kinds of hidden files.  <comment169485> see this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14980/why-are-dot-underscore-files-created-and-how-can-i-avoid-them <comment169487> @MateuszSzloesk thank you, that was useful but I don't understand yet why doesn't finder show them. I just wanna know that, I don't actually wanna see them :) <comment169493> It's not visible in Finder, because informations are stored as extended attributes (Finder "merges" them into original file). You can see them with `ls -la@` or using `xattr` command. <comment169502> Ah ok. Thanks @MateuszSzlosek <comment169509> OP was not asking how He can see hidden files but why He can't see `._*` files in Finder.
