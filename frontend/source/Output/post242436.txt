My iPhone only shows the Wi-Fi symbol even when I'm using data? <body> I noticed when I was checking a notification the other day that even when I was using 4G or LTE data, my phone just showed the Wi-Fi symbol, even when I turned Wi-Fi fully off. I am on an iPhone 5.  <answer248250> I just noticed the same thing. I see the 5 bars then my carrier then where I would normally see LTE, 3G etc I see the wifi symbol. When wifi is turned off that symbol grays out. It used to go away.  I can no longer tell if I am on LTE or a lesser signal.   <comment298204> Have you tried a restart? <comment298229> And screenshot of top of home screen plus what you see in settings app might help. <comment307522> Welcome to Ask Different!
