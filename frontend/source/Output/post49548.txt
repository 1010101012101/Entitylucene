Is there any way to access Google Tasks on iPhone? <body> How do I access Google Tasks on my iPhone or, even better, sync them with the iPhone's Reminders app?  <answer49549> You might consider searching the App Store. A few that turned up were:  ul liGoTasks (Google Tasks Client)/li ligTasks HD /li liGeeTasks, the Google Tasks App. /li /ul  <answer49551> One of the best ways to access Google Tasks is via the webapp. Here is the iPhone version:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BqKK6.jpg" alt=""  And the standard basic HTML view:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFuoS.jpg" alt=""  Hope that helps!  <answer49786> There is a number of native iPhone apps in the App Store that allow syncing with Google Tasks. They are better than using Google Tasks web site because they all allow offline access, so you don't have to wait for the web site to load.  In particular, I recommend the app that I myself wrote - GeeTasks.  I don't think you will find a way to integrate with Reminders, as there is presently no API published by Apple to access Reminders.  <comment56728> Please expand your answer.
