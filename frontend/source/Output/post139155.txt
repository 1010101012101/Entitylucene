How to use automator to create a service which converts an ebook (using calibre commands) <body> I am trying to figure out a way to be able to right-click on an code.epub/code file and convert it to a code.mobi/code file. Currently (thanks to calibre command tools) I can to the following within the terminal  precodeebook-convert test.epub test.mobi /code/pre  So  the fist file name codetest.epub/code is the original, existing file, and the second file name codetest.mobi/code is that it will be converted to.  Is it possible to create a service from automator which could allow we to right-click on the original codetest.mobi/code file and then just convert it?  Thanks  <answer139198>  Open Automator, choose the service template, change "Service receives selected" to "files or folders", add a Run Shell Script action, change "Pass input" to "as arguments", and change the command to:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codefor f;do /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert "$f" "${f%.*}.mobi";done /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNNIC.png" alt=""  Or if you add  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"code2mobi() {   for f; do     /Applications/calibre.app/Contents/MacOS/ebook-convert "$f" "${f%.*}.mobi"   done } /code/pre  to a shell configuration file like code~/.bash_profile/code, you can run code2mobi /path/to/file.epub/code in a shell.
