How to disable autohidden menu opening with full screen apps? <body> I'd like to disable the menu-bar when in a fullscreen app such as Firefox. It's getting in the way when I try to click on tabs with the mouse. How can I do this? Any reasonable alternative, such as fixing it in place, will also help me.  <comment121426> There is a hidden preference for the duration of the animation for showing and hiding the menu bar and tool bar in full screen: `defaults write -g NSToolbarFullScreenAnimationDuration -float 999999999; killall Dock`. That command is not usable though, because once the animation starts, the application won't respond to any keyboard or mouse events. The preference also only applies to applications like Safari where there is a toolbar attached to the menu bar in full screen (like Safari, but not Firefox).
