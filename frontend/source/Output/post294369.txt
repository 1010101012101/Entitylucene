How to start playing first song in playlist after all songs are over? <body> I listen to music on my Mac every day. However after a playlist ends, playback stops and I have to hit codePlay/code manually to start playing the playlist again from the beginning.  Is there anyway to restart a playlist automatically after it has finished playing the last song?  <answer294372> Simply enable strongRepeat/strong → codeAll/code. Right-click strongiTunes/strong on your Dock, and the option will appear.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wItLT.jpg" alt="Repeat All"  There are several other locations, such as the menu bar item strongControls/strong → strongRepeat/strong → codeAll/code, or this icon at the top of your iTunes window, opposite the album art: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2ZP6.png" alt="Repeat"  <comment371573> Make sure that Shuffle is not checked on if you want to play from the very first song in the playlist. Otherwise random song will be played.
