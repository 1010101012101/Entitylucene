Screenshot area to clipboard (Control + Command + Shift + 4) doesn't work <body> According to the Mac support docs, I should be able to use codeCommand-Shift-Control-4/code to take an area screenshot to the clipboard.    This doesn't work.  What am I doing wrong?  Whether I use an external keyboard or not it doesn't work.    codeCommand-Shift-4/code works just fine.  I'm on 10.11.6  <answer253802> Things to check...  ul liThe receiving app can accept the format, .png by default.  /li liThe buffer hasn't been replaced with other content, text etc.  /li liIf kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd 3 /kbd would work to capture the entire screen to clipboard.  /li liThat the key commands are on &amp; set to defaults in System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Screen Shots &amp; also that resetting to defaults doesn't generate an orange warning triangle that another shortcut is using the same key command./li /ul  <comment315875> Are you certain that where you're pasting it can accept it, & that you performed no other clipboard action in between? It's not something I normally use, but tested to Photoshop just fine. Also confirmed copying some text afterwards will kill the image in the buffer <comment315876> Yes, if I copy an image from the browser it works just fine.  Also, the crosshairs never change as they do with `Command-Shift-4`. <comment315877> hmm... does cmd/shift/ctrl/3 work to grab the entire screen? I'm thinking key conflict [but idk where] <comment315878> No, that doesn't work either, although `Command-Shift-3` works fine. <comment315880> Checked they're enabled in sys prefs/Keyboard/shortcuts/screen shots? [You can tell I'm running out of ideas ;) <comment315882> Ah!  Thank you!  New to mac.  I didn't see what it was, but I hit "Restore Defaults" and that fixed it. <comment315884> for the sake of completeness, let me throw some of that into an answer... just in case anyone Googles it in future...
