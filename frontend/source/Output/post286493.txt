Syncing FInder smart folder with images to iPhone <body> I created a smart folder using Finder containing images that I would like to sync to my iPhone. When I opened iTunes and tried to select that folder to sync images into my iPhone, the folder was grey and I was unable to select it.  Does any workaround exist that makes it possible for me to accomplish this synchronization?  <answer287228> I wrote this python script that searches for all files with a blue label (color 4) in a directory and copies it to a regular folder instead of a smart folder.  precode#!/usr/bin/python # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  import os  // You can add several label searches and put them into separate "smart" directories configuration = [             { "color": "4", "location": "/Absolute/path/to/destination directory" }         ]  for config in configuration:     color = config["color"]     location = config["location"]      os.system("mdfind -onlyin /Absolute/path/to/search/directory -literal 'kMDItemFSLabel = 4' &gt; /tmp/favs.txt")     os.system("rsync -a --progress --no-relative --files-from=/tmp/favs.txt  / \""+location+"\"")     files_list = os.listdir(location)     for file in files_list:         if not file in open('/tmp/favs.txt').read():             print("Removing "+file)             try:                 os.remove(location+file)             except OSError:                 pass /code/pre  This script only searches for labels, and not all the other functionality a smart folder can have. For something like this, I would recommend Hazel which is an app where you can make rules for e.g. copying files to a directory based on criteria.
