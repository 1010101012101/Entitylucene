How to connect to an already open Terminal session on another Mac <body> I am running Mac OS X 10.7 on a MBP and OS X 10.8 on a Mac Mini. I can connect to the Mini via ssh without any issues.br I am running GNS3 (Network simulation) on the Mini and have configured it so that when I connect to one of my routers via the console, a Terminal window is opened.  On Linux I can connect to a remote terminal sessions if it's using screen or by connecting to the tty.  strongI would like to connect to the remote Terminal already open on my Mini from my MBP./strong  Do I need to run the equivalent of screen to be able to do this?  When I do a ps -aux on the Mini I get:  precode885   0.0  0.4  2622240  18368   ??  S     2:19pm   0:16.27 /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/Contents/MacOS/Terminal -psn_0_561289 /code/pre  Is there a way to connect to this terminal from a remote computer when I am connected via ssh?    What does -psn_0_561289 mean?   Can this identifier be used to connect to this terminal?  <answer110441> Screen is the best way to do it.  The command is available under both Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.8.  I configured the console sessions in GNS3 to use Terminal and screen with the following command:  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e 'tell application "terminal" to do script with command "screen telnet %h %p ; exit"' /code/pre  This can be found in strongGNS3PreferencesGeneralTerminal Settings/strong  Then I list the screen sessions in my remote ssh session with the command:  codescreen -list/code  and... finally connect to the required router with:  codescreen -D -r &lt;name of session obtained with "screen -list" above&gt;/code  <comment130091> The equivalent of screen on the Mac is screen. Have you tried doing it the same way you do it on Linux? <comment130093> Indeed, I have just posted my own answer. Thanks for the comment.
