How to change master of an existing slide in Keynote 6.0? <body> In Keynote 5.x there was a toolbar button where I could change the master of an existing slide. This would keep the content of the slide, but would change the layout to the new master.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tz8tu.png" alt="enter image description here"  I can not find this functionality in Keynote 6.x anymore. I tried to configure the toolbar - but no "Master" button is there. I looked through all menues. And even the context menu of the slide.  Any hints where this functionality is gone?  <answer111913> Ah! A few more minutes of "seeking" - and I found out where Apple moved the functionality.   For all desperate - here the solution:  ol liMake sure you clicked on the slide-overview (on the left), so that the slide gets a yellow borderbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UleRp.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThen far-away on the right select the "Format" button. Then below it you will see the current master slide for the selected slide. With a small grey triangle on the right. Click this triangle and a pop over will allow you to change the master of the current slide.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H7AKo.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Hope this helps someone in the future...  <answer116393> I found I also had to delete the background on the imported slide.  I clicked the background, clicked the Unlock button on the Arrange panel, and then hit the delete key to delete the background.  <comment357595> Thank you! That's crazy â€” should be a right-click option.
