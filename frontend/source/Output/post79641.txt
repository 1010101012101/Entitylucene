However, without a built in speaker and mic, you can't use it for talking...  And, unfortunately, it doesn't force the call through the handsfree :(  <answer157758> The Apple Watch, which will be released early 2015.  <comment91920> Are you looking for something technical here or is this just a "shopping" question where you seek a list of products that are commercially available that fit your criteria? Any bluetooth device with handsfree functionality, speaker, mic and a button clearly will allow calls to be answered. <comment91994> As I have seen many watches supporting Android, I am looking for some technical details and I also would like to know about the product with these features. <comment94226> AFAIK Pebble will only show you who is calling, but you can't answer or reject the call from the watch <comment94672> If you found a solution to your question please add it as answer below (and rollback your edit to the question) to keep the site in Q&A format. There might be other answers in the future as well and it will just confuse people if one answer is already included in the question. <comment96912> @ Dirty-flow :Using Pebble you can accept the call but you should have another HFP device to proceed further as pebble does not have inbuilt speaker and microphone
