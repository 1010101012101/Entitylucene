From the command line, how do I tell if a particular VPN connection is up? <body> Suppose that I have multiple VPN connections configured in System Preferences/Network.  How do I tell if a particular one (identified by the service name in System Preferences/Network) is up, strongon the command line/strong in OS X Mavericks?  <answer145722> If you know the network address range, you could use "ifconfig" and parse the output to see if an interface is up and running with an IP in the appropriate range.  <comment171408> "Netstat -i" will do it <comment171410> `netstat -i` shows the interface name, which is just `ppp0`, not the service name as seen in System Preferences/Network. <comment171412> you mean the SSID ? <comment171413> use the "airport -I" for that, it will list the SSID name <comment171416> This has nothing to do with SSID or WiFi. I'm talking about VPN connections, which could be tunnelled over wired LAN or WiFi alike.  If you configure a VPN connection in System Preferences/Network, you have to give it a service name, just like the rest of your network connections ("Wi-Fi", "Bluetooth PAN", "Thunderbolt Bridget", etc). I'm talking about *that* service name. <comment171439> `system_profiler -nospawn SPNetworkDataType` Will list interfaces. If You add `-xml` it'll be printed in XML format, so that You can parse it. <comment171460> @MateuszSzlosek Nice! This edges towards a complete solution. Given that the output of that command is in plist format, would it actually be available and queryable through the `defaults` command? <comment171744> That's actually what I would like to avoid. Given that the IP address is assigned by the VPN server, relying on an address range would not be the most reliable way.
