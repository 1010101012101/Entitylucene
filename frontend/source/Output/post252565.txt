My SATA hardrive was ejected, and is unable to be remounted due to issues <body> I have a Mac Pro 2012, so it's running Mountain Lion :( but it has a few partitioned drives. I have tower 1 and tower 2. Tower 2 just recently froze my computer, this has most of my videos for editing, so losing it would be quite the shame. I restarted the computer and the tower 2 icon on the left side was gone. I tried repairing it in Disk Utility, and then also in Terminal. This is the response I'm getting from my trusty ole Apple:  precodeLast login: Tue Sep 13 18:34:11 on ttys001 DAJ-ROMMs-Mac-Pro:~ andrew$ diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk1  Repairing the partition map might erase disk1s1, proceed?

I always end up on this response. I would really like to continue my editing, so if this rings a bell for anyone, I'd be forever grateful.  precodeLast login: Wed Sep 14 14:03:44 on ttys000 sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1       start        size  index  contents          0           1         PMBR          1           1         Pri GPT header          2          32         Pri GPT table         34           6                  40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     409640  1953115495          1953525135          32         Sec GPT table 1953525167           1         Sec GPT header gpt show: /dev/disk2: Suspicious MBR at sector 0      start        size  index  contents          0           1         MBR          1           1         Pri GPT header          2          32         Pri GPT table         34      411614              411648  1953112064      2  GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 1953523712        1423          1953525135          32         Sec GPT table 1953525167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer252807> To determine what's wrong with your hard drives or volumes you first have to get an overview. The best tools to get this are codediskutil/code and codegpt/code â€“ both command line tools which have to be executed in Terminal.app.  Open Terminal.app and enter:  precodediskutil list /code/pre  To execute a command you always have to enter the kbdEnter/kbd key.  The command above will yield something like this (depending on the number of disks in your Mac):  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2    2:       Microsoft Basic Data tower 1                 1.0 TB     disk2s2 /code/pre  The example shows the following:  ul lidisk0 is your system drive containing an EFI partition (disk0s1), your main system volume "Macintosh HD" (disk0s2)  and a recovery volume (disk0s3). All partitions sizes (0.2 GB + 499 GB + 0.7 GB) add up to the total size of the disk (500 GB)/li lidisk1 is a 1 TB drive only containing an EFI with a size of 200 MB and with 999.8 GB empty space/li lidisk2 is a 1 TB drive containing one 1 TB volume probably formatted to FAT32, ExFAT or NTFS/li /ul  Now one can deduce that the missing volume emtower 2/em once resided on disk1.  strongAfter a reboot the disk identifiers of the second and the third disk may be exchanged! So always execute codediskutil list/code before manipulating partition tables!/strong  To get a closer look on disk1 use codegpt/code:  precodesudo gpt -r show /dev/disk1 /code/pre  This will reveal:  precode      start        size  index  contents          0           1         PMBR          1           1         Pri GPT header          2          32         Pri GPT table         34           6                  40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B     409640  1953115495          1953525135          32         Sec GPT table 1953525167           1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  This means:  ul liThe disk has a GUID partition table (GPT)/li liThe first partition (index = 1) is an EFI type partition (C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B), starting at block 40 and with a size of of 409600 blocks (~209.7 MB)/li liStarting at block 409640 1953115495 blocks (~1 TB) of the disk are not allocated to a partition./li /ul  You can assume that your "lost" partition (with the volume name emtower 2/em) once resided here.  After adding a partition it has to be formatted and a file system has to be created. The file system may be (beyond others): HFS+, ExFAT or NTFS  If you know the previous file system you can continue restoring a partition. If you don't know the file system you can determine it by searching for typical file system headers.  To determine a previous HFSJ volume use:  precodesudo hexdump /dev/disk1 | grep "48 46 53 4a" /code/pre  This will search for the string "HFSJ" on your raw disk. After getting the first results simply enter kbdctrl/kbdkbdC/kbd to abort the command.  On your type of disk you should get the following results:  precodec805400 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff ca13e00 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff ca40e00 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff ... /code/pre  Here the important line is the first one: codec805400 48 2b 00 04 80 00 20 00 48 46 53 4a 00 00 01 ff/code with c805400 being the offset in hex. Converted with a hex2dec service this means an offset of Byte 209736704 (dividing this by 512 Bytes/block, the result is equal to block 409642). Typically the 3rd block of an HFSJ volume contains the string "HFSJ". So you have found the beginning of an HFSJ volume: block 409640 (emBlockF/em).  The end of an HFSJ volume can be found accordingly because the 3rd last block contains the last HFSJ occurrence:  precodesudo hexdump -s 930g /dev/disk1 | grep "48 46 53 4a" /code/pre  The option -s means: Skip offset bytes from the beginning of the input.  With the last offset (and doing the math like above) you can determine the last block (emBlockL)/em of the previous HFSJ volume by simply adding 2 blocks. The size of the HFSJ volume is then (BlockL-BlockF).  With all necessary data gathered you can now try to restore the lost volume emtower 2/em with the codesudo gpt add .../code command.  To add a partition entry you have to execute:  precodesudo gpt add -i number -b number -s number -t type diskX /code/pre  with  ul li-i index number/li li-b number of the first block/li li-s size in blocks/li li-t partition type/li /ul  I don't know neither the first offset nor the second offset of your volume emtower 2/em, but the command below may work and the entered sizes are probable defaults:  precodesudo gpt add -2 -b 409640 -s 1952443704 -t 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC /dev/disk1 /code/pre  After adding this entry in the partition table the volume should be mounted automatically.  Check the disk and the volume with:  precodediskutil verifyDisk disk1 diskutil verifyVolume disk1s2 /code/pre  If a repair is necessary use the "prefix" repair instead of verify!  hr  If you have any questions or can't find the string "HFSJ" please add a comment with em@klanomath/em!  <comment314453> Thank you. Yeah it's reading syntax error ^ <comment314536> Done! that looks a little more promising <comment314538> You should first enter `diskutil list`. The command lists all available hard drives and their partitions. One volume should have the name tower 2. If the volume name is missing and only tower1 is visible you have to determine the bogus volume/device by the exclusion principle: E.g having installed 3 hard drives: one with 500 GB and two with 1 TB and you are missing a 1 TB volume this excludes the 500 GB drive (probably disk0). <comment314539> With 2 x 1TB drives left, one shows the volume name *tower 1* (e.g with the device name disk2) and the other one shows nothing you can deduce that *tower 2* was on the only possible device name left: disk1. Entering in Terminal `sudo gpt -r show diskX` then means replace X  either by 1 or 2. So the resulting command is then `sudo gpt -r show disk1` **or** `sudo gpt -r show disk2`. <comment314548> Just for fun, why are you running Mountain Lion? <comment314935> I got this response when I input all of that. (Thank you by the way. This is unbelievable help you're giving. It truly means a lot.) <comment314936> Last login: Fri Sep 16 21:06:42 on ttys001 DAJ-ROMMs-Mac-Pro:~ andrewrommelfanger$ sudo gpt add usage: gpt add [-b lba] [-i index] [-s lba] [-t uuid] device ...
