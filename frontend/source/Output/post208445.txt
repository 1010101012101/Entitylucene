Photos app wants to upload my library to iCloud once again <body> After I upgraded to OS X EL Capitan, I need to turn iCloud Photo Library once again on my Macbook Pro, but once I tap on codeiCloud Photo library/code checkbox the Photos a[[ wants to upload my images once again. But every image now exist in my iCloud Photo Library. I do not want to upload this once again.  I had 5GB, my library was 25GB, So I bought a new plan with 50GB for 1$ per month. Now It wants to upload 25GB once again, but there is not enough space, so it redirect me to upgrade my iCloud storage plan to 200GB. I do not want that. All I need is to turn iCloud Photo Library on my mac once again. Is it possible? How can I do that?  What does it mean?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhOKD.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer209438> Had same problem, steps to start syncing again:  ol liopen system preferences/li liiCloud/li licontrol.../li lilocate your Media data and click delete/li liit will be marked as deleted and available for download during 30 days, free space will show all of your space/li ligo to Photos/li liSettings.../li liclick [x] iCloud/li linow it will turn on/li ligo back to System preferences/li liiCloud/li liControl.../li lilocate your Media data and click Cancel Delete/li libe happy/li lilet me know if that helped ;)/li /ol  <comment252630> Thx for reply, I will try this soon...:)
