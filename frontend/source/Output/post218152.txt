Disable Rootless on Headless Mac <body> I understand that the way to disable rootless is through the Recovery Partition. However, I have a remote, headless Mac with an attached bootable clone drive that I access via Screen Sharing. Can I either:  a) Boot into the recovery partition using the command line?  or   b) Boot into the clone and change the rootless status of the HD from there?  <answer248434> If codecsrutil disable/code doesn't work, you can try to disable it via boot args, e.g.  precodesudo nvram boot-args="rootless=0" /code/pre  then codereboot/code  <comment320506> This does not work using OS X El Capita.
