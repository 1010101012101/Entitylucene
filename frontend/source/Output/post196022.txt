Backwards Compatibility for Snow Leopard software on Yosemite <body> I have just upgraded to Yosemite due to a mac crash, my older mac installation ran Snow Leopard.  My issue is I have software which I have paid for that is compatible with Snow Leopard, however it doesn't run on Yosemite.  A good example is below screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIZs7.png" alt="enter image description here"  The solution which the software provider suggests is to upgrade for $200, that is alot of money to spend so I am searching for backward compatibility options for running older programs designed for Snow Leopard on Yosemite.  Does anything like this exist?  <comment234062> Have You tried to change `/System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist` file as suggested on https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/cant-install-komplete-7-on-yosemite.230992/ ? (You'll need to use `sudo` to change the plist).
