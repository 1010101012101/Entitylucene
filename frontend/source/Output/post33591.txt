How can I move the Downloads toolbar button in Safari 5.1 and newer on OS X? <body> In Safari 5.1 on my Mac, the Downloads button appears on the toolbar at the right of the search bar when you download a file for the first time:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qp1x2.png" alt=""  I want to move that button elsewhere on the toolbar, so I open strongView  Customize Toolbar.../strong and drag it to where I want it. The other toolbar controls move to make way for the new spot, but when I drop it, nothing changes; the Downloads button returns to its original position.  Interestingly, I don't have this problem on Safari 5.1 on Windows; I can move the button anywhere I want. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with these observations:  ul liThe list of downloads appears as a window on Windows, but as a popover on OS X./li liThe Downloads button appears by itself in the Customize Toolbar window on Windows, but not on OS X, where it only appears in the default toolbar set instead./li /ul  How can I reposition the Downloads button in Safari on OS X?  <answer33618> Drag the other controls around it; as long as you don’t grab the Downloads button itself this will work.  <answer58365> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vHzyV.png" alt=""  I managed it—look at the picture above! Right-click → Customise Toolbar and move the URL bar out, then move it back in on the right.  <comment38295> Until they fix it, you can't. <comment38296> @Gerry: So it's a bug? <comment38326> I'd say so, but it's not officially confirmed afaik. Always the remote possibility it is a 'feature'. <comment38349> Yep, it works. Makes it seem even more of a bug that I can't drag the button itself. <comment172931> Please explain how you did that.
