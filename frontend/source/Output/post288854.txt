Apple Mail lost signature and filter rules <body> I use Apple Mail since 2004, am now on macOS Sierra (10.12.5), iMac Late 2015, Mail Version 10.3.  About two weeks ago I noticed my strongmail signatures/strong were no longer available. Later I saw my strongmail rules/strong stronghad gone/strong too, filter settings like "all IEEE news to the newspaper folder" was no longer there.   I did not install any new software; emI did notice some hangs on my iMac/em, had to restart it on about three occasions (pressing power button for 10 seconds), used disk utility to check the drive. I think I don't use iCloud mail, but I changed a setting in iCloud (use iCloud Drive to sync files) recently. I use gmail and four 'private' services, all over IMAP. To guard against viruses and the like I use F-Secure.  I have time machine backups, can recover files from there â€” emwhat files in ~/Library do I need to recover?/em
