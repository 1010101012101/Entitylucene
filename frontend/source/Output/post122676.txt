AppleScript working until placed in cron; causing Chrome to go unresponsive <body> Good afternoon.  Question: I have a simple apple script telling Google Chrome to open, go to a URL, and enter presentation mode...  precodetell application "Google Chrome"     activate     make new window     set myURL to "http://myURL.php"     tell window 1 to make new tab with properties {URL:myURL}     tell window 1 to enter presentation mode end tell /code/pre  Running in AppleScript editor, it behaves correctly.  From CLI, it also behaves correctly...  precode/usr/bin/osascript /&lt;fqpn&gt;/openURL.scpt /code/pre  but if I take that snippet and put it in my cron, it fails to go to fullscreen and Chrome becomes unresponsive, requiring a force quit.  I get the following error in /var/mail:  precode/&lt;fqpn&gt;/openURL.scpt:725:748: execution error: Google Chrome got an error: AppleEvent handler failed. (-10000) /code/pre  I have no ~/.* files on this account (OSX 10.9.2), so I tried sourcing my /etc/profile first in my crontab, but no effect.  Any ideas what my problem is?  -Chris  <answer123002> Using the same applescript; I moved over to launchd; using a generic template pulled from  http://launched.zerowidth.com/  and everything behaved just as expected.  I'm not sure emwhat/em I was missing in my cron environment; but the answer seems to be to avoid crontabs for simple applescripts for now..
