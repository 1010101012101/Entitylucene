How do I get calls organized by phone number? <body> Hi I would like to organize my recent call list by number instead of the default sorting by date. Or I would like to see the list of previous calls &amp; messages with a phone number.  Currently I am just going back in history to see if I received a call from someone in the past couple days. It will be great if order by phone number/contact option is available  I am using Iphone 5, iOS 8.4.0  Android phones are able to do this. It is quite useful  <answer201763> Generally speaking, please include hardware and software information, e.g. iPhone 4s, iOS 7.1.2, when asking questions as not all features are available in all models and iOS versions.  That said, I do not believe you have a choice, at least I don't on my iPhone in the Phone app, however I have an app on my MacBook Pro (also available for Windows) called iMazing that I can sort my call history by All and Contact and by Date, Contact, Duration and Number.  I can also export to Text or CSV files.  There may be a third-party iOS App that can do what you want right on the iPhone.  callLog may be a possibility.  <comment243255> It should be mandatory to include hardware/OS/software details. I'm sure there's a meta question for that, of course... <comment243256> That does not currently appear to be an option in iOS. <comment243307> Nice answers here: http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1141/i-think-system-specifications-should-show-as-signature/1147. Maybe it is not such a good idea after all. It's just tiresome to ask for details on almost half of the questions. <comment243408> I need an app on the phone, not on the desktop <comment243415> @adam, Did you miss where I said "There may be a third-party iOS App that can do what you want right on the iPhone. callLog may be a possibility." which included a hyperlink to callLog?
