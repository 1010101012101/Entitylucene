Modify iMovie app to launch holding Option <body> Managing macs in a lab environment. Need a way to modify the iMovie app so that when a user clicks on the app it will launch directly to a screen asking the user to set the location of their new iMovie Library.  This is normally done by holding OPTION on startup, but in a highly trafficked lab it's impossible to teach every user this method.  Upon logging out of the mac, the user's profile and iMovie projects are erased...and iMovie doesn't allow me to set a default location.  I've played with the idea of planting a blank, read-only iMovie project in the dock, so that when a user clicks on the iMovie icon they receive an error message saying that the project is read-only and they must create a new library.  Downside is that this method doesn't work if the user selects iMovie from a location other than the dock; or if the user closes iMovie and reopens it they will not receive the prompt to start a new library; and I don't want users greeted with an error message.  strongtl;dr/strong:  want iMovie to begin with a prompt asking the user to create a new library without having to hold OPTION.
