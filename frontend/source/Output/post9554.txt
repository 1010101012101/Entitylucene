iPhone's 3G usage counter <body> Maybe this is silly but...  How can I find out the 3G usage on my iPhone 4? (like a counter telling how many Mbytes I have been moving over the 3G network)  <answer9556> 3G data usage is listed in the General Application under Usage.  But you can also download AT&amp;T's app or Vodafone's app to check it from their perspective as well.  <answer9569> As Michael pointed out you can use the usage stats in Settings to find this out although I would be surprised if your carrier doesn't provide you with this information.  What network are you on? Most of them even have apps which tell you your call/text/data limits when logged in (or at least they do here in the UK).  <comment10013> Ok, that's a start. Now I need to monthly reset the statistics. So I need an app for that...I'll check with my carrier (Vodafone) like you suggested. Thanks <comment10027> I'm on Vodafone. They probably do have this info somewhere.... <comment10029> Try logging onto your mobile account or searching the appstore for MyVodaphone. I haven't used it myself but it's there...
