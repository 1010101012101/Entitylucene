How Do I Type with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)? <body> How Do I Type with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)? I need to type in Phonetics, but I cannot find a keyboard. I tried the IPA Unicode 6.2 keyboard, but it did not work. It installed, but when I selected it, I could only type the normal english-latin characters. I cannot use copy/paste sites like This, as I need to type a lot.  I am using a MacBook Pro, With Sierra  <answer261020> You should normally not have a problem making the IPA keyboard work. It uses "dead keys" to create the IPA characters. A “dead key” is a key that does not generate a character, but rather changes the character generated by a following keystroke. For example, in the IPA keyboard, to get the “ə”,you would type the dead key “=” followed by the “e” (=e).  Charts showing the how all the IPA characters are made this way can be found in this PDF.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rITvu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer261028> If the standard IPA layout doesn't work for you, I would suggest making a custom keyboard layout with Ukelele (or if you prefer text-based editing, KeyLayoutMaker).  Alternatively, if you don't need quite the level of speed that can offer, you can simply use the Character Palette (Edit  Emoji and Symbols) to type the characters by double-clicking them. To get the "Phonetic Alphabet" pane to show up, customize which are visible with the gear icon in the top left.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vdCyv.png" alt="character palette"  <comment326819> Tried it. not working, anyway, can you explain how these deadkeys work in your answer? <comment326846> Thank you for your answer. It really helped me. I was frustrated typing through the emoji symbols. <comment326848> It sure works ok for me.  What happens when you type the sequence =w =e =r =t =y =u =i =o =p ?  Do you not get ʍəɹθʏɯɪɒʘ ?  What app are you using?
