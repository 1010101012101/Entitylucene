How can a bring the windows of an application on the primary display? <body> For some reason my Air still uses its own LCD when the lid is closed, so that I often find that an apps windows are all on a display that I cannot see.  Is there any way of bringing them to the primary display without randomly clicking and dragging in the hope of hitting a title bar?  <answer32201> Although the issue is rather strange, you can always take a look at some of the utilities suggested in this stack exchange question. I personally use SizeUp so I'm able to move windows from one display to the other at will (something I do fairly often).  <answer32209> System Preferences  “Displays” prefpane  “Gather Windows” button at the bottom right corner.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8UhI.png" alt="Displays System Preferences"  You can access the Displays prefpane faster by hitting kbdalt/kbd and the function key that changes display brightness (exact name depends on your model, so I won't give any here).  <answer32239> This is also possible to do using Hyperdock. The preview windows that show up when hovering an application in the dock can be dragged out to wherever you'd like them. This also works across spaces.  <comment36930> Gather Windows only fetchs the monitor windows ( http://stackoverflow.com/q/360551/97777 ). Does it do more for you? <comment36931> Thanks for the `Alt` hint. I've been using Quicksilver and typing `displays` blindly! <comment36933> @DuncanMcGregor Oh sorry, I replied from memory, since I don't have any external screen to test with at the moment  :(  I really thought it gathered _all_ windows. Well, I'm pretty sure there's a way to do this, since I remember having had the problem, but then I can't find out without having test material. Sorry for the misleading answer! <comment36936> I'm pretty sure that at one time it did gather all windows, as just the prefs ones are pretty useless, but ho hum. <comment36989> I'll check it out thanks
