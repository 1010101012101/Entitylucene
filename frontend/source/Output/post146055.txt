Is there a way to order all the files and folders automatically? <body> I am new to OS X, but there's one thing that annoys me a little bit, which is that every time I have to emclean up/em all the files (by name, for example) because they are always pasted in an unordered way.  I would not like to lose time to order them every time I change the content of the folders.  <answer146056> Instead of using Clean Up By, use strongArrange By/strong. This both cleans up the layout and sets the default sort order for the folder for the future so that any modifications to the folder will update the sort order.  <comment172092> I assume this is Finder - if so use list or grid format <comment172093> *grgarside* Is this applied also to sub-folders right? <comment172101> @cell That depends. You can force it to be default though by setting up a folder how you wish, then press âŒ˜J and click Use as Defaults.
