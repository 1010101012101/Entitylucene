Where is the insert key on a MacBook Air? <body> I am trying to edit a line of code within a program that I use for work.  I need to use the kbdinsert/kbd key to be able to add additional spaces that I can then type letters, numbers or characters.  How to get this function to work on my MacBook Air?  <answer29475> It depends on the physical keyboard and on the keyboard layout. You can try...  kbdctrl/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbdM/kbd OR  kbdctrl/kbd+kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#x232B;/kbd  <answer40206> On the latest Macbook Air 13" kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x232B;/kbd works.  <answer50520> kbdFN/kbd + kbdReturn/kbd = kbdInsert/kbd  (MacBook Air 13)  Also Works on MacBook Pro.  <answer69287> kbdFN/kbd + kbdReturn/kbd works for me to insert.  <answer80911> I need the insert key in the Midnight Commander (MC) running in Terminal and in Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) when connecting to my Windows PC.  For Midnight Commander the answer is Ctrl+T.  For RDP I did not find better solution than to use a free program on Windows AutoHotkey and map the key to chosen key combination, for instance this macro maps the Insert key to Ctrl+Alt+I :  strong^!i::/strongbr/ strongSend {INSERT}/strong  Answer found on Microsoft forum  <answer169371> I posted a possible answer to this question in a similar question topic on StackExchange:  How do I simulate the Insert key in Windows on a MacBook Pro?  In it, I'm explaining how to re-map the key combination codeFn+Ctrl/code to codeInsert/code using Karabiner.  <comment33988> What program are you using on your MBA that requires an insert key?  In that program are you certain that the Insert key will do what you expect on your MBA? Try plugging in a PC-style USB keyboard and pressing Insert in the program; does it work as expected? <comment67695> What country / language keyboard are you using? <comment72850> fn-return is normally enter. <comment80882> Your answer here is merely a repeat of an existing answer.  If you don't have an original answer, don't answer.  Instead, mark up the existing answer that you agree with.  (Though in this case, I don't think it's right.) <comment114277> This actually worked for me, also MBA 2013.  Upvote. <comment114278> Worked for me, MBA 2013 <comment136548> This worked for me on an MBA 2013, running Windows <comment142898> Same here on an MBA 2013 using ArchLinux. <comment212501> Please don't accept this bug and complain on https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/5296f0ac-2ccd-45a7-b722-3d5e46bd475c/microsoft-remote-desktop-for-mac-insert-key?forum=winRDc -- that's the only way to get the needed attention and have it fixed! <comment216982> Finally, something that worked. CTRL+FN+M worked on my MacBook Pro (4,1). Everything else failed. <comment247134> This should be the accepted answer. Worked for me on a 2012 Macbook Pro on Windows 10 (via Bootcamp). <comment314455> Related: [Simulate INSERT key in Mac OS X](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/169130/22781)
