Finding the file that's modified when you run a terminal command? <body> I want to know what file is modified when I run a terminal command like:  precode osascript -e "set Volume 0.5" /code/pre  Is there a way to do this? I'm thinking maybe a command that looks for recently modified files in setting directories.   <answer272570> In general, you can use ‘opensnoop’ which will list files being accessed in realtime. You'll need to disable SIP to use this command.  precodesudo opensnoop /code/pre  To use opensnoop on a specific process such as osascript, use  precodesudo opensnoop -n osascript /code/pre  For that specific command, no file is modified. It's setting the current volume, that's all.
