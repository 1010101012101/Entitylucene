How do I clear my Bash history in OS X? <body> How do I clear my Bash history in Mac OS X?  I've entered a few "errors" and just want to clear them off. How do I do that?  <answer129277> To clear it, just delete the code~/.bash_history/code file. If you want to just remove the offending lines you can open code~/.bash_history/code in the editor of your choice. For me, this would be  precodeemacs ~/.bash_history /code/pre  and then going to the beginning of each bad line and pressing kbdcontrol ^/kbd+kbdK/kbd.  Or your can just fill your code.bash_history/code with empty. Run this: (including the code&gt;/code)  precode &gt; ~/.bash_history /code/pre  <answer132096> You can run:  precodehistory -c /code/pre  I use it often, so I made an alias to codehc/code.  <answer132100> To view your bash history enter the command:  precodehistory /code/pre  You will get an index of your history.  You can clear your entire history like so:  precodehistory -c /code/pre  You can clear the 45th item in your history like so:  precodehistory -d 45 /code/pre  (get you can see the history item numbers by executing the codehistory/code command)  <comment155249> Just to note, this works for clearing history from the current shell while my answer is for sessions that have already been closed.
