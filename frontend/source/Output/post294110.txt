Devices connect to iPhone via WiFi tethering cannot see each other <body> I've been experimenting with different ways of transferring files between Android and iOS devices while "in the field" away from WiFi networks and internet access. Nothing I've found works as well as AirDrop, but apps like InstaShare, Dukto, and Feem all work decently well emif/em you have a WiFi network to connect to. Since WiFi isn't always available in the field, I thought that I could just create a WiFi hotspot on my iPhone, connect my Android device to the network, and use Feem/InstaShare/Dukto to transfer the files.  This is where things get interesting. If I create a WiFi network on my Android device (Nexus 7 2013 running Android 7.1 Lineage OS) and connect my iPhone to that network the devices can see each other and exchange data. If I create a WiFi network on my iPhone and connect my Android device to that network the devices emcannot/em see each other.  Is there a way to allow devices to "see" each other on a WiFi network created by an iPhone?
