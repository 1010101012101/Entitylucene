How to reset your keyboard on OS X 10.10.4 <body> My keyboard number pad has been messed up ever since I installed OS X 10.10.4.   The numbers type as follows:    when I press "1" increase volume key goes up as well.    When I press "2" the ' key comes up as well.    "3" some wired key.   "4" ] comes up.   "5" [ comes up.   And "6" the equals sign comes up.   And vice versa for the concurrent keys. 7 and 8 as well as their shift keys work fine, 9 highlights everything in shift and goes to the beginning.   I've tried a reinstall and a separate Bluetooth apple wireless keyboard I have seems to work fine.   Please help I've scoured the Internet for answers, nothing has worked.  <answer195627> You would have to open up your mac and unplug the keyboard cord power up the mac and then plug it would be a hard reset  <comment233566> When a separate keyboard works fine, it often indicates that the problem keyboard has physical damage. <comment233572> what is your setting for the keyboard input source ? <comment233573> The Bluetooth keyboard does not have a numbers pad section. <comment233583> This answer doesn't really make any sense, could you perhaps try using some punctuation in there? <comment233720> Excuse me, I meant the number section above the letters. <comment233821> The setting is US English
