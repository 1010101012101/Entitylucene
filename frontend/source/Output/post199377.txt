Turning Off Notifications While Presenting <body> On Yosemite how can I turn off notifications on Yosemite while presenting or showing the screen to someone?  I know I can set the do not disturb for a time period but I was wondering if there is just an on off switch without having to set a time.  <answer199381> You can either use the System preferences- Notifications- and use one of the options there that suits your need to turn OFF.  Or you can use keyboard shortcuts, in the syst pref- keyboard- shortcuts, and assign a short cut that will turn On/Off the Notification (keyboard is faster) but you have to remember the short cut.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgE8o.jpg" alt="do not disturb"  There is also this method https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/154563/46541  <answer199391> ul liSimplest way is kbdOption (⌥)/kbd + kbdClick/kbd Notification Centre button; top right corner. It should make the NC dim. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70bJU.png" alt="On" ⟶ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MAJVn.png" alt="Off"/li liOpen NC then go to Today tab scroll up, it should show Do Not Disturb button, just turn it on.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/96wQV.png" alt="Do Not Disturb"/li li@Buscar웃 said you can also turn on the keyboard shortcut./li /ul  <comment239967> did you try the Syst pref - Notifications, in there either use the Do Not Disturb -time or the when Mirroring ect... <comment239968> That's it!  I was looking on the Notifications tab.  But they put the Do Not Disturb switch on the Today tab for some strange reason. <comment239969> You can also use a keyboard shortcut-- find it in syst pref -keyboard shortcuts (and set it to what you like) to turn on/off.
