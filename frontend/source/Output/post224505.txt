Is it impossible to delete/move a file named "␀" on mac? <body> When I try to move, rename, or delete a file named code␀/codein Finder, I get this error message:     The operation can't be completed, because an unexpected error occured (error code -50).   With codemv/code, coderm/code or codefind -delete/code in Terminal  precode rm: /Library/␀: Invalid argument  mv: rename /Library/␀ to /tmp/␀: Invalid argument  find: -delete: unlink(/Library/␀): Invalid argument /code/pre  Can I move or delete this file in Mac OS X or do I have to use another operating system?  I even tried creating a file with this name in code/tmp/code and it has not gone away since 8 reboots.  <answer224517> You can attempt to remove the file by its inode number. List the files in /Library with the code-i/code option  precodels -il /Library /code/pre  The first column is the inode number of the file. Then use codefind/code   precodefind /Library -inum XXXXXXX -delete /code/pre  where XXXXXX is the inode number of the file.  <answer225880> This seems to be a 10.11 only problem, so it's impossible to delete on 10.11 at least, but you can very likely delete this on any OS X version other than 10.11, (I tried 10.4 and 10.10, and I could delete files with this character).  <comment272295> Can you run `ls -b` or `ls -B` on the file to see the specific character codes? <comment273910> I don't know why my comment was deleted, but this just passes the filename to unlink, giving me the same "Invalid argument" error. <comment274212> How did you get this file? If you didn't create it, it's probably an important file used by the OS that you don't *want* to delete. <comment274215> @gardenhead I created it myself. <comment309895> Which command or program did you use to create this file? <comment309896> The bug is on the creation side. Otherwise many commands would fail on a Unix environment. For example `find -print0`, `xargs`...
