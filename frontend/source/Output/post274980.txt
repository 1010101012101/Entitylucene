iPhone 7 Plus not appearing on Airdrop <body> So I just got myself a new iPhone 7 Plus and I am having some issues with Airdrop. While I can send files to other devices just fine, the other devices cannot see my iPhone. Airdrop is turned on for Everyone and I already tried rebooting the device. Maybe there's some other setting that I am missing?  <answer275000> Try going into Settings  General  Reset  Reset network settings.  That will also clear out any remembered WiFi networks so you will have to re-authenticate. But I have found that doing this often fixes a variety of network-bound problems.  <answer275008> Erasing all contents and settings and setting up the device as a new iPhone did the trick. (It had been previously restored from a 6S backup).  <comment345851> Is bluetooth and Wifi turned on as you're doing this? <comment345854> Yes, and Airdrop is sending files just fine. The problem is when I try to send files from other devices to my iPhone. <comment345865> Unfortunately, this didn't work. <comment345869> If you can't see the person or the device that you're trying to AirDrop to, check the following: • Check that both of you have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned on. If either of you have Personal Hotspot on, turn it off. • Make sure that the person you're sending to is nearby. You can't AirDrop to users who are out of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi range. • If the other person’s AirDrop receiving setting is set to Contacts Only, and you’re not in their Contacts, have them set their AirDrop receiving setting to Everyone.
