Bypassing it is practically impossible unless you are the original purchaser.  ul liHow can I bypass Activation Lock?/li /ul  See that thread for how to get a hold of Apple's support, but basically you either need to re-enter the locking user account and password or you need the person that controls that account to log in themselves to http://icloud.apple.com and remove the lock against this hardware.  ol liRegain control of the account that was used before to lock the iPhone/li liUnlock that device with that previous account/li liActivate the iPhone with your account to lock it to yours/li /ol  <answer212071> My iPhone has been unlocked. the problem was Apple id in I cloud was different of Apple id in I tunes.  and both of apple id was very similar because first character of both was "m" , so iTunes show me i can unlock with "m....@gmail.com" i could not recognize maybe owner of mobile has entered 2 apple id, one in I cloud and another one in tunes, so after checking his email we understood he had 2 apple id. we entered second apple id and now it is unlock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SBjma.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment255300> i check my activation lock status by IMEI, it is on .is there any email or site that we can fill that and submit the form for check/review of locking. actually i got Password of my iphone by Tel Conversation and entered 3 times mistake password, after that i got the correct appleid and pawword by SMS, so i am sure this appleid and password i use to sign in to itunes is correct and is for owner (my friend), if you know some email address or contact point with apple for unlocking this iphone ,please send to me.
