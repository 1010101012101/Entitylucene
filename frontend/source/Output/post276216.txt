I have a Wacom CTE-640 and cannot get it to run properly/find a driver for it <body> I have a Wacom Graphire 4 CTE-640, silver. It reacts as though the pen is always down, no matter how I try to use it. The area responds, but I have to lift my hand completely for the pen to stop.   I am running Mac OS X El Capitan on a MacBook Pro.  <answer276223> The Wacom Graphire 4 CTE-640 is quite an old model (over 10 years I think), so you can't really expect Wacom to continue updating drivers for newer versions of macOS.  That said, have you tried using the PenTablet 5.3.3-3 driver for Mac OS X? This is the last official driver for your model and was released to support Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8. If not, it may be worth giving it a go (or, if you have, removing it and re-installing it).  strongPotential workaround/strong  If installing the above driver doesn't seem to work, there's also a potential workaround that emmay/em get it to work. With the above driver installed, do as follows:  ol liOn your MBP, go to Apple  System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/li liSelect your user account in the left-hand pane/li liEnsure the padlock at bottom-left is strongnot/strong locked/li liClick on the Login Items tab on the right-hand side/li liNow go to System Preference  Hide Others/li liNow select the Finder from your Dock (usually left-most icon)/li liPress and hold down the kbdoption/kbd key/li liWhile keeping the kbdoption/kbd key down, click on the Go menu and select Library/li liThis will open a new Finder window displaying the Library folder/li liWithin this folder, find and open the Application Support folder/li liNow you will need to see if you can find the driver that you've previously installed. Look for a emTablet/em folder or emWacom/em folder and open that. If you see something like emWacomTabletDriver/em, then drag it to the Login Items window you previously opened at Step 4/li liExit System Preferences/li liReboot your MBP to see if it now loads the driver/li /ol  strongNote:/strong I have not used the above process for your particular tablet, but I have helped others with other Wacom tablets and this has worked in some cases.
