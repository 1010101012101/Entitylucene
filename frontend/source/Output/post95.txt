Sync iPhone with multiple Macs <body> Is it possible to sync an iPhone with multiple computers? I know the music will be restricted, and I don't mind. I want the contacts, bookmarks, etc. to be in sync across my home iMac and my MacBook.  <answer101> The best way to synchronize contacts and bookmarks between several Mac and/or iPhone is to use MobileMe (now iCloud). It will sync all as you need where you want.  <answer205> You can have your music synced to one computer and contacts synced to another - no problem.  <answer221> You actually don't have to buy MobileMe to sync contacts and calendar to multiple Macs and multiple iOS devices. This can be accomplished with only a free Google account. If you want more details on how to set it up, please ask.  As far as I know, there is no way to sync bookmarks without MobileMe.  <answer2633> Actually, I just answered the question to how to keep your device's music library synchronized with 2 machines as well: Sync iTunes U between 2 Macs via an iPod  <answer2642> One way to partly solve this (without paying for MobileMe) is by syncing certain data between different computers using Dropbox. (This approach was suggested in a Super User question about syncing home folders that I asked a year ago.)  To sync strongcontacts/strong, for example, share AddressBook's application data between your Macs like this:  ol liMove the folder code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/code (on the computer where you have the data) to your Dropbox./li liOn each computer you wish to sync, create a symlink from code~/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/code to that folder in your Dropbox./li /ol  These screenshots show what the setup looks like on one of my computers:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HCC21.png" alt="alt text" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nal2n.png" alt="alt text"  (If you need more detailed instructions, please let me know!)  For strongbookmarks/strong, you'd need to share some Safari application data (I don't know which files/folders exactly as I haven't done that myself).  Obviously this isn't optimal, but once you set it up, it works pretty well. I think Apple is sooner or later going to provide better (cloud-based, even wireless) sync across multiple devices (also to those who're not paying extra for the service). Well, at any rate they emshould/em, as they are lagging behind Google quite badly in this respect.  <comment169> That's not really what was asked though -- it wouldn't keep contacts on the phone and two different computers all in sync. <comment2336> Oh, if you don't use Dropbox yet, feel free to use this [referral link](http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI4OTY2OTE5) when signing up â€” that way you get 2.25GB (instead of 2GB) to start with. :)
