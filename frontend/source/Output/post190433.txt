Google Chrome Web Browser Keeps Causing My MacBook To Crash <body> Chrome seems to be causing my macbook to crash, like, constantly. I don't mean chrome is crashing but my entire computer.  I think it has something to do with OpenCL but that's just wild speculation. I can't find my logs (ATM) but I remember I kept seeing fatal OpenCL errors connection to chrome and them subsequent computer crashes [read: wipe-outs].  There seems to be a lot of Chrome + OS problems: bing search.  ul liAny ideas how to get crome working properly on OS?!/li /ul
