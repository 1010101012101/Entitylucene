Encryption apps or password managers for iPhone without cloud or Internet connection <body> Is there an encryption app or password manager available for iPhone that doesn't have a cloud connection or that can be disconnected from the cloud and the Internet?  <answer164129> I use 1password (https://agilebits.com/onepassword) for a long time already. Especially because it syncs very well across all my devices :) However you can install iPhone only app and set in the Settings - Sync Service - Disable Sync.
