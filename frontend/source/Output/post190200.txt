Why does mDNSResponder make Ansible run slowly? <body> I upgraded my OS to OS X 10.10.4, which swaps discoveryd for mDNSResponder. My Ansible playbooks, which previously ran normally, now run incredibly slowly - tasks that took seconds previously now take several minutes.  Turning off mDNSResponder appears to solve the issue. Why might this be?  Notably, regular SSH connections work normally when mDNSResponder is running, it's just Ansible that runs slowly.
