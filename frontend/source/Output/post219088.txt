Activate desktop using Applescript <body> Basically, I have this short script to "clean up" the desktop. This is the code:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "Finder" to activate desktop     delay 0.1     tell process "Finder" to click menu item "Clean Up" of menu "View" of menu bar item "View" of front menu bar end tell /code/pre  The script works fine when there are no Finder windows open. However, if there is at least one Finder window, when the line codetell application "Finder" to activate desktop/code is run, it will make that window active, rather than the desktop.  What is the reason for this? And what is the correct way to put the focus on the desktop (same effect as clicking on the desktop image)?  (Doing this on El Capitan)  <answer219183> You could tell Finder to minimise all it's windows by:  precodetell every window     set collapsed to true end tell /code/pre  Then codeactivate desktop/code and the usual.  <answer220536> Here is some code I could make work on my "Capitan":  precodetell application "System Events"   tell application "Finder" to activate   repeat while (value of attribute "AXfocused" of group 1 of scroll area of Â¬      process "Finder" is {false})         keystroke "&lt;" using command down   end repeat end tell /code/pre  The repeat-loop checks whether "group 1 of scroll area" --which to my surprise em"is" Desktop/em-- is "AXFocused" (meaning finder's active "window").br emIf NOT/em so, it keystrokes "cmd &lt;" (on a German keyboard), which is identical to finder's:br &lt;menu: "Windows" / "Next window" menu item.br You will see some or all of your windows embrought to front ONCE/em.     em(I tried all kinds of "clicks", "selects" and the like beforehands  to no avail ...)/em  <comment267279> Thanks! This the best solution I have seen so far. I order to make it work for any keyboard, I replaced `keystroke "" using command down` with `tell process "Finder" to click menu item "Cycle Through Windows" of menu "Window" of menu bar item "Window" of front menu bar`
