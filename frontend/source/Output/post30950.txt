Where did the "hide the toolbar" thingy go on OS X Lion? <body> On OS X Snow Leopard, there was an option to hide the toolbar in many applications, such as  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jBGRq.png" alt="toolbar thingy"  but I don't have that option on Lion anymoreimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qNgkt.png" alt="lion macvim"  This isn't MacVim specific issue, I don't see it in Adium and many other applications too. Did the button just disappear? Is there any way to show ita again?  <answer30954> I don't think there's a way to make the toolbar capsule widget thingy show up again.  However, if you want to hide the toolbar, you can right-click on the empty toolbar area and choose the "Hide Toolbar" option:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qn4pr.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also go to the View menu and choose "Hide Toolbar" from there.  It may also have a keyboard shortcut of kbdcmd/kbd-kbdopt/kbd-kbdt/kbd.  <answer41877> Right click and "Hide Toolbar" works for most apps. I couldn't get it to work with MacVim but this should:  Add the following to your .vimrc:  precodeif has("gui_running")     set guioptions=egmrt endif /code/pre  test it out via:  precode:set guioptions=egmrt /code/pre  <comment47504> It was called the "lozenge"
