 How can I reset the answers of the security questions of my Apple ID? <body> I forgot the answers of the security questions. Not that I seriously need to do it now, but there might be a problem if I need to answer those in future.  I still remember my password.  How can I reset the answers of the security questions?  <answer60667> You don't need to remember the answers to your security questions to edit them. As long as you know the password to the account you can log at AppleID.apple.com at the Manage Account link and click on the security and passwords option on the left and change your questions. (I've just tested it on my account with no problems).   <answer71494> There is no way to reset your Apple ID security questions online after the Mat Honan hack and its aftermath.  I was able to reset my security questions by calling Apple Support on the phone, emprovided I could remember at least one out of three/em.  However if you can't remember any of the three, you might have trouble.  <answer71833> If you know your password to your Apple ID and have set up a second email address, you can reset your security questions by logging into the web site https://appleid.apple.com even if you can't answer the security questions that normally are required to make changes to the existing security questions.  Once you have logged in, click 'Password and Security'.  Then click/tap the link in the lower right that says strongForgot your answers? Send reset security info email to m * * * *@monsters.edu/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFPzt.png" alt="reset security info for Apple ID"  You will get an email with a link to reset not only the security questions and answers, but correct your birth date which can be used to verity your identity when you are calling Apple or trying to reset a password.  h2img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Adbka.jpg" alt="Email for Apple ID security info reset"/h2  I don't have an Apple ID without a recovery email, so perhaps if you have not entered that second email, you might not be able to send the reset email and might need to contact Apple directly for help with your Apple ID. I know of people that have gotten things reset over the phone even after the Mat Honan incident where his account was compromised over the phone with Apple's assistance.  <comment69823> Are you talking about your AppleID? If so you remember your password you can edit these questions at appleid.apple.com <comment69827> I can't. I've to answer the old questions first to edit them. <comment69833> When I click on Password and Security option, it just ask me two of the three security question and a continue button, I can't go through them, unless I answer them. <comment69853> That's quite interesting. I logged into my other AppleID (a non iCloud one) and I got the same as you. I guess you'll have to call AppleCare if you don't know the answers - although I hear they've suspended any password resets over the phone for the moment. <comment83048> Nope, you have to answer the questions to change them. Which is impossible if you can't remember them... <comment83214> That means I have to live with forgotten answers, though I can always reset password through email, if I ever forgot it. Thanks for the info. <comment83256> if you ever need to provision a new iOS device, it will force you to answer the security questions. So you'll be stuck eventually. <comment83419> I don't know if Apple has changed things in the last 48 hours, but was just able to reset my security questions and answers with only my ID/password as a self-service change using the web. See my answer to this question for specifics... <comment83434> I've 4 email id added with the apple id, but still I can't see the link to reset the security question. Can you please add another screenshot for the location of the reset link? Thanks <comment102590> Jeff's answer is wrong.  This one is right (I just added a missing step that may have tripped up Creator.   I get the "Forgot your answers? Send reset security info email to..." message. (Or perhaps Jeff was treated differently because he was using a browser/from an IP he hadn't used with his Apple ID before.) <comment102613> This scenario very likely may have changed over time: when this happened to me recently, Apple Support sent a code to my iPhone, and had me generate and read back a code on the Apple ID site while signed in. This was apparently sufficient authentication for them to reset my questions, despite my not remembering any. <comment252795> Jeff's answer isn't wrong for me.  I can get in, change my password, hell, even update my credit card information after being logged into the App Store.  But it won't let me change my security questions without already knowing my security questions.
