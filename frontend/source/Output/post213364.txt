customize system launchagent arguments in el capitan <body> Is there any way to work around the inability to customize launchagent plists in El Capitan emwithout/em completely disabling system integrity protection?   Specifically, I was sad to find that my ssh-agent timeout had been removed, and horrified that I couldn't put it back. I see other q&amp;a on how to reboot in recovery mode and disable SIP, but that seems a bit drastic... is there some other workaround?  I don't have great knowledge around launchctl as a whole; is there a way to set a code-t/code option some other way than editing code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.openbsd.ssh-agent.plist/code?  Can I disable the system-configured agent and set it up under code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code? Would that lose any functionality compared to the system agent?  <comment257595> Why don't you just disable SIP, apply all necessary adjustments and reenable SIP afterwards again? <comment257597> I'm hoping to avoid needing multiple reboots to and from recovery mode just to change the default ssh-agent timeout. Obviously that is a solution... but it has a strong "theres _gotta_ be a better way to do this" smell to it.
