How to remove or filter the 3 second videos that live photos create from the movies view in Photos app on Mac? <body> This seems like the silliest thing, but when I import my photos from iPhone to Mac, all the live photos show up as both the proper 'moving photos' (in photos view), and as 3 second videos clips (when showing movies through a smart album or the 'movies' left selection).  This is extremely annoying when trying to find actual videos through a smart album as they have the same extension (.mov) as real videos, and I can't find a way to filter by length or resolution in smart albums.
