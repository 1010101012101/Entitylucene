How to down-clock RAM? <body> My Mac (strongMid 2009- MacBookPro5,5/strong) stronglaptop/strong installing OS strong10.8.2/strong.  Currently, it is using strong2 x 1GB (1066 Mhz)/strong.  My friend gave me strong2 x 2GB (1600 Mhz)/strong of his 2012 Mac.  strongAfter installing 2 x 2GB (1600 Mhz)/strong on my Mac, it can strikenot/strike boot but can not start OS. This is the error that show on strikeboot/strike start up screen:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMGr6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But it is strongpossible/strong to install strong1x 1GB (1066) + 1x 2GB (1600)/strong. The system can strongdown-clock/strong it to strongboth 1066 Mhz/strong. But what i still have 1 x 1GB (1066) + 1x 2GB (1600) strongleft/strong!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vVJKo.png" alt="3GB @ 1066 Mhz"  strongMy question is:/strong Any strongbetter/strong solution than using 1x 1GB (1066) + 1x 2GB (1600)?   strongMore certainly, is there any way to install 2 x 1600 Mhz? (even down-clocking to 1066 is accepted)./strong (currently, 2x1600 Mhz can not startup OS).  Edit 1: 4 RAM are healthy.  <answer275951> I recently ran in to a similar issue when trying to squeeze a little more life out of an old iMac. I could only get 800mhz DIMM's but the specs say it needs 667mhz. I can interchange 1x 667mhz DIMM with 1x800mhz DIMM but a single 800mhz DIMM or two 800mhz DIMMs result in a failure to boot.  My hunch was that the motherboard emthinks/em it can run at 800mhz so doesn't downclock it to 667mhz unless there is a slow DIMM in one of the slots forcing it to.  I did some research, and discovered the timing information is set in the SPD data stored on an EEPROM on the DIMM. I booted an Ubuntu 16.10 liveUSB on the iMac, codeapt-get install/codeed codei2c-tools/code, codemodprobe/codeed the codei2c-i801/code module to enable the SMBus (which talks to the DIMM EEPROM) and read out the SPD of a working and a too-fast DIMM with codei2cget/code. After a lot more research, I merged the timing information from the working DIMM in to the SPD of the too-fast (but larger) DIMM. codedecode-dimms/code can calculate the correct CRC. I then wrote the modified data back to the fast DIMM with codei2cset/code.  I can now pair that down-clocked DIMM with an unmodified 800mhz DIMM, and the system correctly downclocks  the memory bus to 667mhz and boots.  <comment92874> Relevant: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/42101/can-i-use-16gb-ddr3-1600mhz-ram-in-an-early-macbook-pro-8-2/42104#42104 <comment92909> Yep. A faster ram is always capable to speed down to lower frequences ... <comment92929> @MatthieuRiegler: My question is: how to do it. I am very appreciate the answer about how to down-clock 2x1600 to 1066 on this system? Because currently, i can not start my system with 2x2GB. <comment92945> It should do it automaticaly. It's not the ram it self who desides at which speed it runs. <comment92951> I've posted an answer that is incorrect. But it should do it automatically, if not, it's problem with the module.
