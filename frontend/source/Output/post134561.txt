Command to close terminal window <body> When I want to close a window I type codeexit/code :  precode mbp-thomas in ~ ○ → exit logout  [Opération terminée] /code/pre  Then kbdcmd/kbd + kbdw/kbd to close the window.

I'll try it right now <comment159248> @glennjackman post it as an answer, you'll win +25 <comment159751> He did not ask how to quit terminal.  This is not answer to his question. <comment159924> While the question already has a great answer, a quick tip on the side: `CTRL-D` does the same as typing `exit` and hitting `ENTER`, but is much quicker. Also works when logging off a remote server in an SSH session. <comment160161> True, and while it is technically and semantically different, for all intents and purposes, that is what's happening, except if there are multiple instances open (or wants an app without window processes running).
