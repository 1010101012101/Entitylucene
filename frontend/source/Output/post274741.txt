Kernel Extension Not Loaded <body> I built a self-made kernel extension (named codeKAuthTest.kext/code) and would like to test it out. So in a VM running macOS 10.12.3, I did the followings:  ul lidisable SIP by running codecsrutil disable/code in recovery mode, and reboot./li lidisable kext signing check by running codesudo nvram kext-dev-mode=1/code and reboot/li ligive it permission: codesudo chown -R root:wheel KAuthTest.kext/code/li /ul  Then I load it using codesudo kextload KAuthTest.kext/code.  However,  ol liin the system log, I didn't see the log from its start function/li liwhen I run codekextstat | grep -v com.apple/code to see all third party kexts, I didn't see my kernel extension./li /ol  So did I miss something? How I can successfully load this into the kernel?  Note:  ol licodekextutil -n -print-diagnostics KAuthTest.kext/code gives this:     Diagnostics for KAuthTest.kext:   Code Signing Failure: code signature is invalid   KAuthTest.kext appears to be loadable (including linkage for on-disk libraries). /li liI did try rebooting, but still no luck/li /ol
