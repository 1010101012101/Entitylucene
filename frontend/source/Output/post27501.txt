Is the font in Messages.app changed in iOS5? <body> The fonts in the Messages app look much better in iOS5 than in iOS4, and wanted to confirm it. I couldn't find any discussion or note about this online. I don't have a phone running iOS4 around to compare myself.  Has it really changed? Any sources?  <answer27504> Same font, but Apple added a very subtle text-shadow and tweaked the bubble reflection. That's the difference.  strongiOS 4/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQiDN.png" alt="iOS 4"  strongiOS 5/strong img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DaCqd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment31648> Yep, the text shadow was indeed what was causing the text to stand out. Thanks for the screen shots! <comment32884> What a horrible message on iOS 5...
