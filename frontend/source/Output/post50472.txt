Launch agents not lauching at system startup <body> I have several plist files in the folder code~/Library/LaunchAgents/code. They all have the same permissions but two of them (dotjs and pow) are not launching at login, even if they have the key codeRunAtLoad/code set to codetrue/code. Does anyone know why they are not loading?   (I'm using Lion 10.7.3.)  EDIT:  I am able to launch the files manually with the command: codelaunchctl load -w cx.pow.powd.plist/code for example.  <comment57897> Have you checked the Console logs (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app)? There maybe some error messages in there that will give you a clue. <comment57899> They're not supposed to run at startup. They are supposed to run when you log in. <comment57908> @HaraldHanche-Olsen Unless I've misunderstood what you meant, isn't that exactly when user launch agents run - when the user logs in? <comment57912> @HaraldHanche-Olsen yeah sorry, that's what I meant. <comment57914> @binarybob No messages in the console. Also, i'm able to launch them manually with `launchctl load -w cx.pow.powd.plist`.
