OS X reinstallation and Amazon software. <body> I just purchased a second hand, 2-Week old MacBook Air. I downloaded the strongMac Office/strong from Amazon. When installing, I'm prompted to enter an strongAdministrator Password/strong, which I still don't have, as the guy who sold me the computer has not yet given it to me.  So, can I reinstall the computer without this password? And if so, will I be able to re-download the Office file from strongAmazon Software Library/strong? And, would this reinstallation solve my problem of not having the computer's Administrator Password?  <answer68690> I the first place, there are strongways/strong of strongresetting/strong the strongAdministrator's Password/strong.   Answering your questions, strongyes/strong, you can reinstall the computer without this password. Just follow strongApple's/strong instructions.   And, strongyes/strong, you'll be able to emre-download/em the software from Amazon, as stated in its strongHelp Page:/strong     You can download an unlimited number of times for personal use. To re-download, go to Your Games and Software Library through the "Your Digital Items" link at the top of the screen and click the download button.   And, again, strongyes/strong, making a clean installation will make a new strongAdministrator/strong user, with a new password which will be chosen by you.  strongNote/strong: Both of the links regarding OS X reference Lion, as you never stated which version of OS X you are using. These instructions, though, will work for Mountain Lion too.
