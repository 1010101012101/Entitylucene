How to remote control my grandmother's iPad <body> My grandmother has an iPad 2 with iOS 9.3.5. Due to old age and Parkinsons, she's sometimes having issues using it for very basic tasks. We (her daughter and grandkids) want to be able to somehow remote control it, to help her with things like opening attachments to emails, finding her sister's blog in the bookmarks, and so on. We would like to be able to see the screen so we can give her better instructions over the phone, and be able to click things for her.  Between us, we have two laptops with Windows 10, an iPad with iOS 10.2 and a MacBook Pro with iOS 10.12.1. Being able to remote control it from any one of these devices would be sufficient.  What is the easiest way to do this?  <comment334192> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question belongs on another site in the Stack Exchange network <comment334193> @lemonslice Could you help me migrate it? <comment334194> Sorry I tried to but was not able to (not authorized I guess) <comment334195> @lemonslice I'll repost there, and you can vote to close this one instead :)
