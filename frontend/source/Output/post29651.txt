Change an AT&T iPhone 3G to another provider? <body> How can I change my no-longer under AT&amp;T service iPhone 3G to my new sprint service? Sprint doesn't use sim cards.   <answer29656> You can't.  AT&amp;T and Sprint use incompatible technologies.  <comment34046> Exactly. The iPhone 3G does not have compatible hardware. <comment87766> You can port the number to a sprint iPhone or select a phone that works with spring. AT&T is now unlocking phones, so you should be able to sell your AT&T iPhone for decent money - even in late 2012 and an iPhone 3G.
