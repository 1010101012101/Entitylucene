Imported Calendar into Google Cal and processes are consuming massive CPU for hours <body> I'm consolidating calendars and on the step of importing an exported iCal file into a Google Calendar int he Apple Calendar app. The file is only 1.8MB and at first it imported and all seemed fine. I spot-checked the some of the calendar entries and they looked good.  So, I changed the destination calendar color in Fantastical (btw, I'm using Apple Calendar to to the importing/exporting, not Fantastical) and it seemed to have kicked off a hellstorm of run-away processes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxXfy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, I'm now getting these errors in the Apple Calendar app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MjYt.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/86LpS.png" alt="enter image description here"  After about an hour, I rebooted, thinking there might be some of loop the process are stuck it, or some deadlock or race condition, but once the machine was back, the processes started right back up and has been running like this for another 45 mins or so.  I turned off the Google calendar in Internet Settings and rebooted, and the issue stopped. However, I'm not 100% sure all my entries were properly imported, so I re-imported the calendar again and make sure not to tough any calendars in the process. Once again, those processes went wild for a few hours and now it is just the codesoagent/code and codecallservicesd/code processes consuming 100% CPU each.  Lastly, I've noticed that Messages started to take 100% CPU in both attempts of the import, so I closed it. Not sure why that would happen.  What could be the issue?
