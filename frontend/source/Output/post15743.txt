Can I enable file removal in the open window on OS X? <body> Can I enable file removal in the open window on OS X?  The open or save dialogs do not allow you do do many opeations, like removing a file or renaming it.   Is there any hidden codedefaults/code preference that could enable this?  <answer15746> I've been using Default Folder X (35$) for years to add this capability, among many others.  <comment17130> An excellent product from an excellent (and long standing) developer.
