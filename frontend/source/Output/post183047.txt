OS X terminal "open" command and keeping focus on the command line <body> I appreciate the "open" terminal command to launch OS X apps. When invoking the open command for any purpose, it is overwhelmingly likely that I will have at least one other command I would like to type into the terminal before tending to the application I have just summoned.  How do I keep focus on the terminal when using the emopen/em command?  <answer183050> Use the code-g/code flag.  From the codeman/code page:     code-g  Do not bring the application to the foreground./code   Example: To open the folder at your current path, behind the current Terminal window:  precodeopen . -g /code/pre  hr  As a side note, it is often better to manually peruse the documentation for new commands, as the verbiage may be different from what you expect:     i.e. "Do not bring the application to the foreground." vs. "Maintain terminal window focus."   <comment218089> Instead of piping through grep, have you just read the manage for open? <comment218092> In deed I missed the -g option when I read through it the first time. I only started grepping when I ran out of ideas. Thank you. <comment218093> Thanks, I did give the man page a good read through, though apparently I fell short of a good perusal. I did try a few others other than 'focus', like 'background', but 'foreground' never occurred to me. <comment218095> No worries!  It happens to the best of us! :)
