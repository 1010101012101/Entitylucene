Mail, Contacts, and Calendar missing on iPad <body> I deleted Mail, Contacts and Calendar in Settings on my iPad 2.  I can't find how to retrieve them.  <answer285230> You have to search the apps that you deleted on the App Store and reistall them   <comment359635> Your question is unclear since you can't delete a portion of the settings menu, however in more recent iOS version what was once called "Mail, Contacts, Calendars" as a single item is now 3 items.  Is that your issue? <comment359651> If not in the settings menu, did you delete the apps themselves?
