Pop Up Button always has the same value in AppleScript <body> I have a Pop Up Button in Xcode with multiple choices, they are All, 1, 2 3, etc. to 15.  In my AppleScript code I call it ItemPicker:  precodeproperty ItemPicker : missing value /code/pre  I have made a Referencing Outlet from "ItemPicker" to Delegate. When I use the value later in the code, I do this:  precodeset multiple to ItemPicker's stringValue() as string /code/pre  But for some reason, codemultiple/code is always code1/code.  How do I fix this?  <answer296102> Have you checked out Stefan's answer to this question on MacScripter?  He says to make a handler like this:  precodeon didSelectItem:sender     log sender's titleOfSelectedItem() as text end didSelectItem /code/pre  Then connect the handler to the selector on the popup button.  Link to MacScripter article: http://macscripter.net/viewtopic.php?id=43906  <answer296202> I solved it. You have to set it to codeindexOfSelectedItem()/code instead of codestringValue()/code.  So instead:  precodeset multiple to ((ItemPicker's indexOfSelectedItem()) as string) as integer /code/pre
