How can I remove a "shared" drive from my Mac? <body> How can I remove a "shared" drive from Finder left bar (and my Mac mini late 2012 computer) under macOS Sierra 10.12.6?   I've tried all the suggestions I can find online, but nothing seems to work. It is a drive called “intel_ce_linux”, and I first saw it after my new Internet Service Provider technician "installed" and checked my new Internet modem. How can I get rid of it completely (i.e. not just hide), please?  I think the guy mentioned something like Bonjour (pardon my French…) while checking the modem, but I am not sure…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/clMrA.png" alt="This is what I see in my Finder"  <answer292978> Unless you can turn off the modem's shared drive the only way to prevent that from showing up is to turn off all "Bonjour computers" from showing up in the sidebar.  ol liGo to Finder and open a new window.  /li liGo to the finder menu and select "Preferences..."  /li liClick the sidebar icon at the top of the Finder Preferences window /li liUn-check "Bonjour Computers" and close that window./li /ol  Note that will remove any shared device from the sidebar including Windows PCs, other Macs, NAS devices and the like that support auto discovery via TCP.  <comment369628> Please add the  modem model. <comment369653> Thank you @klanomath!
