Global shortcut to have finder open my home directory <body> New Mac/OSX user here. Thanks to google I've come up with this automator script:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Finder"         activate         make new Finder window to home     end tell      # return input end run /code/pre  I saved this as code~/Library/Services/New Finder Window Home.workflow/code.  In codeSystem Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts/Services/General/New Finder Window Home/code I assigned it a new shortcut key kbdALT/kbd+kbdCMD/kbd+kbde/kbd. It's supposed to mimic kbdWin/kbd+kbde/kbd key on Windows.  On every application I see this script in the top menu in code&lt;App name&gt;/Services/New Finder Window Home/code and pressing that combination works.  strongExcept in Finder itself/strong  In Finder itself, this script does nothing. I would like to behave it the same way as everywhere else: just open me my home directory.  strongSolution thanks to Thomas/strong  It seems I need to assigned this to the codeService/code strongand/strong as part of the codeApp Shortcuts/code with the same shortcut (would be great if someone could explain that too).  <answer135490> Go in codeSystem Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts/AppShortcut/code then add a shortcut for finder with the desired menu name (Home I think) and put your keybidding kbdalt/kbd+kbdcmd/kbd+kbde/kbd and voil√†  <answer183017> Hey man I found this thread after searching how to do this exact thing. I figured it out and thought I'd post it here for any who might be having the same trouble. I am running 10.10.2 btw.  The solution is to have the service receiving 'no input'. That way you can just hit the shortcut and it won't be waiting for something to process, which was causing it to not do anything.  Once you save this, go back to System Preferences/Keyboard/Shortcuts. Navigate to Services and scroll to the bottom. You should see the service in a category called General. Assign a shortcut and it should now work.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/q13FuB4.png" alt="This is what your AppleScript should look like"
