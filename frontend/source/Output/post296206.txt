App for mac that automatically rearranges apps when I plug in to an external monitor <body> I'm looking for an app for my mac that automatically rearranges apps when I plug in to an external monitor.  An app that let's me arrange windows in certain positions and save them as configurations that I can select later to reposition them.  Something a lot like Stay (I've tried in the past) but with multiple named configurations that I could apply. Stay also doesn't work with Adobe's Create Suite of tools.  <comment374117> @Allan Somewhat of a duplicate, but the title of that question is not so good and the circumstances there are pretty specific. Also this OP has requirements not satisfied by *Stay*. I think this one should be open. <comment374145> There's a much better dupe somewhere, with lots of alternatives... I'm hunting...
