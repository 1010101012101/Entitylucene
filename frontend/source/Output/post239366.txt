Does Google Maps iOS have voice navigation <body> I have been using Google Maps iOS (Australia) and i have never received voice navigation. Is this supported? And if so is it supported in Australia? And if so once again, where should I check to get this working. I am using an iPhone 6Plus.  <answer239368> Yes, voice navigation is available in Google Maps for Australia.   To enable it:  ul liMake sure you have the most-recent version of iOS. /li liMake sure codeNotifications/code for the app are turned on./li liIn the app, after you've started the navigation, tap on the 3 vertical dots on the bottom-right of the screen/li liIn the panel that slides up make sure codeMute/code is codeOff/code./li /ul  Doing all this will allow you to hear the turn-by-turn navigation prompts.   Here's a Google support site with additional information.
