Print HTML to PDF while retaining hyperlinks <body> I'm trying to create a PDF document from an HTML document.  Of course it's easy to do this using the built-in PDF Printer, however, this does not retain hyperlinks.  I've tried wkhtmltopdf which looked very promising, but it crashes on every attempt.  Is anyone aware of any other options for generating a PDF document from an HTML document while retaining URL links?  <answer15023> You can do this using Adobe Acrobat.  In Acrobat, go to File- Create PDF- From File. Select your HTML doc, let it do a bit of work, and then use File- Save As to save it.  All hyperlinks will be intact.  <answer15067> Found an answer over on SuperUser.com: wkpdf  Free, works perfectly. All hyperlinks retained.  <answer59373> The built-in Safari browser seems to do this when you do codeFile -&gt; Print -&gt; PDF -&gt; Save as PDF/code, it works for me as of Version 6 of Mac Safari.  <answer156299> I have tried dompdf in the past and has worked very well for me. dompdf PHP  <answer270044> Check out the "Save as PDF" browser plugins:  Chrome plugin: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kpdjmbiefanbdgnkcikhllpmjnnllbbc  Firefox plugin: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-as-pdf/  Both are free, but developed by a commercial company http://pdfcrowd.com. I tried the FF plugin, and except for some minor layout overlapping in the converted PDF document, all hyperlinks were clickable and working.  <comment16234> I can't confirm if this works, but something you might consider is converting from HTML to LaTeX. Then convert from LaTeX to PDF since LaTeX is a common way to create hyperlinks in a PDF. <comment16271> Thanks for your answer. Is there a non-$200 option? <comment16292> @Ian I'm sure there is, but I haven't seen it yet. <comment16293> After looking for two days, I've yet to find one, for Mac or Windows, that retains hyperlinks that have anchor text. Very strange. <comment68421> True, and this has worked in the same nice way in older versions too. [OmniWeb](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omniweb/) did so too, but I have not used that for years, so things might have changed. <comment68769> Does it retain the hyperlinks for you? <comment97250> Also good is wkhtmltopdf. Both of these tools are available via Homebrew on Mac OS. <comment210776> no longer installs; author seems to have purposefully disabled installation in anticipation of future incompatibility; WTF? <comment210777> Is there a way to automate this, like what wkpdf used to offer? <comment210781> There is an incompatibility with Yosemite from what I gather. <comment308465> @Ian For me this retains "external" hyperlinks, but not links to within-page named anchors.
