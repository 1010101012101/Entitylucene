Do MacBooks have a true "Hibernate" option? <body> I've recently switched from Windows to a MacBook pro. In Windows, there are the following shutdown options:  ul listrongStandby/strong - the machine goes into a "light sleep" from which it can awaken very quickly (like, in a few seconds), but plenty of energy is consumed./li listrongHibernate/strong - the OS dumps the current system state (including the contents of the RAM) to a file, then turns the machine off. Wakeup takes longer than from standby, but there is no latent energy consumption. /li listrongShut down/strong - the OS shuts down, and the machine is turned off. /li /ul  In OS X, what I can see is  ul listrongSleep/strong - seems equivalent to standby, or an even lighter form of sleep as Mail seems to even continue to poll for new email? /li listrongShutdown and restore/strong all apps on next start - turns off machine, seems to start the OS from scratch and restart alls apps - from what I can tell, it's emnot/em hibernation/li listrongShutdown/strong and don't restore apps - shut down/li /ul  is this correct, and does OS X not have a true "hibernate" mode that can write its state to disk? Because that's what I'm looking for really. There's talk of a "Safe Sleep" mode on the Internets, but I can't see it in my OS X menu. Is it hidden in 10.7?  <answer51726> Yes, it has a hibernate option. Apple calls it codeSafe Sleep/code. When you put the Mac to sleep, OS X dumps the RAM onto the disk and goes to normal sleep (like Windows's Standby). When the battery is too weak to hold the RAM in standby, the computer is turned off. Then it's in the mode you call hibernation which is technically called "ACPI mode S4" or "Suspend-To-Disk".  You can force "Suspend-To-Disk" by disabling the standard sleep via SmartSleep or via codepmset/code on the command line. Its man page has a lot of information on codeSafe Sleep/code.  <answer51729> When newer laptops are put to sleep, they should save the contents of the RAM to code/var/vm/sleepimage/code but keep the RAM powered as well. Desktop Macs should just use normal sleep mode by default.  codeman pmset/code:  precodehibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.  hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.  hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of memory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you should use this setting. /code/pre  ul li0 (traditional sleep mode): fast wake up and sleep, saves disk space/li li3 (default safe sleep mode): fast wake up and sleep, state is kept when losing power/li li25 (hibernation): saves energy, state is kept when losing power/li /ul  You can see which mode your Mac uses with codepmset -g | grep hibernatemode/code and change it with codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode $mode/code.  Some newer Macs support a standby mode on 10.8 and later. Even if codehibernatemode/code was set to 3, they power off memory after a bit over an hour of sleep.  <answer51744> Expanding on Max Ried's answer above, I've been using this free app to enable hibernation on my macs for at least the last 5 years: Hibernate by Patrick Stein.  I set it to "hibernate only" mode, and every time I put my mac to "Sleep," it instead skips straight to codeSafeSleep./code  So far I haven't had any issues that I can prove were caused directly by this app; that is to say my computer rarely crashes or hangs, and I repeatedly "Hibernate" it when I need to take my laptop someplace with me (rather than shutting it down) often for weeks at a time without issue.  I should mention that my newest mac is a 4-5 year old MacBook Pro, so I have not tested this app on newer machines.  <answer124341> Also, the original poster notes that sleeping OS X machines continue to periodically check mail, etc. This is a feature on new-ish machines (it debuted in the 2011 MacBook Air) called PowerNap. In effect, the computer wakes periodically and briefly from sleep in order to handle recurring tasks.   A summary from Apple's http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5394:     While sleeping, Power Nap allows your Mac to do things like periodically check for new mail, calendar, and other iCloud updates. When plugged into AC power, Power Nap can also perform things like Time Machine backups to an AirPort Time Capsule and download OS X software updates while your Mac sleeps.      When your compatible Mac goes to sleep, Power Nap still works to do the following:      Mail - Receive new messages.   Contacts - Your Contacts update with any changes you may have made on another device.   Calendar - Receive new invitations and calendar updates.   Reminders - Reminders updates with any changes you may have made on another device.   Notes - Notes updates with any changes you may have made on another device.   Documents in your iCloud account -  iCloud pushes any edits you made to a document to your Mac notebook.   Photo Stream - Your Photo Stream updates with new photos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.   Find My Mac - Locate a lost Mac notebook even when itâ€™s sleeping.   VPN on demand - Corporate email updates securely.   Mobile Device Management - Remotely lock and wipe the computer.       Power Nap does more when your Mac is plugged in to an AC outlet:      Downloads software updates   Backs up with Time Machine   Performs Spotlight indexing   Continues background downloads of Mac App Store items, including software updates   Updates Help Center content    Wake on Wireless support for Apple and third party wireless base stations   <comment59113> Yes, look here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/377/14994 <comment59114> Actually, it's not that much battery drained while in Sleep mode neither on MacBooks or other laptops. Additionally starting with Windows Vista the OS dumps the memory content onto the disk even if you go to standard standby so you can remove the battery of cut off the power adapter. Of course only unless you disable it. <comment145412> It is best to include a link to the source when quoting if possible. <comment145413> @dwightk Thanks for the edit and the constructive criticism. <comment145416> This is very interesting (I've been wondering about why my Macbook always has the latest E-Mails even though it was supposed to be sleeping), but I don't really see how it is related to this specific question? <comment161040> For the actual `pmset` commands, see here: http://superuser.com/a/630985/73619 <comment252588> Useful to have the extra note on standby mode, though sometimes I think it doesn't kick in and the Mac exhausts its battery before hibernating. <comment297523> The link shows that Power Nap is actually available on the MacBook Air (Late 2010) and later, given OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.2 or later. <comment314695> So, to hibernate my Mac, I'd first set hibernatemode=25 and then either close my lid or give the command `pmset sleepnow`. And then remember to put hibernatemode back the way it was when I next wake up? Too bad there's no `pmset hibernatenow` command. <comment346475> What is the difference between 'Shutdown and restore' and 'Hibernate' option mentioned above? <comment346551> @genonymous What do you mean with "shutdown and restore"?
