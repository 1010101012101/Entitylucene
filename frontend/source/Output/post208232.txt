Copy text that only selectable with 3 fingers tap <body> On my Mac Yosemite 10.10.5, I can tap 3 fingers to lookup for a word. That lookup could select text from virtually anywhere. I would like to copy that text to clipboard instead of doing lookup. How could I do that?  <answer208244> Just right click and copy. Or highlight the word(s) and press command-C  <comment251424> Three finger tap can select text from Label, which normally won't let you highlight with simple left/right click action.
