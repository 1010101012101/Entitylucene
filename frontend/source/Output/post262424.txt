IPad Air won't play any videos now <body> My ipad now won't play ny videos at all from any site. Netflix, Safari, youtube app, youtube in safari, iMovie, Pinnacle studio pro all do not even play videos after the update.   My software is up to date with the latest update, I just checked it today.  I've cleared my network settings, cookies, history, rebooted the ipad and tried five different networks.  I don't know what else to try. It's been like this for four weeks now.   Any suggestions would be greatT  <answer262427> First make a backup using iTunes or iCloud. As Apple Support suggest their first solution would be do a Network settings reset. I think that what you said you have done already . If you have already done that, they said to reset all settings. That would probably solve your problem. If that ain't help either just do a Erase all content and settings reset. If neither of them work properly, you have to take that into Apple support center.  Before do any of these reset, I highly recommend to backup device.
