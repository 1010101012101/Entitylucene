Silencing "Your disk is almost full" notification <body> After upgrading to macOS Sierra, I'm getting the notification that "Your disk is almost full. Save space by optimizing storage.":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvec6.png" alt="macOS notification"  The options appear to be to store my files in iCloud, automatically delete files, or manually delete files:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GofyN.png" alt="enter image description here"  My problem/irritation is that I have 80GB free of my 440GB volume.  The question: strongis there a way to silence this notification in a (semi-)permanent fashion/strong, or to change the threshold it uses for the notification?  <answer254788> I think this notification is a bug.  I have 760GB free on my drive (a 1TB drive) and still get this same notification every morning since upgrading to Sierra.  I enabled Optimize Storage (but not Store in iCloud).  <answer275380> Some desperate suggestions for desperate times:  ol liI see you have 132 GB of applications. Is it possible that you have some items in there that were downloaded from the App Store and therefore could be deleted? Things like OS Installation apps, etc. This does not emspecifically/em address your question, but might help you figure out where the threshold is./li liIf you have (or can get) a spare disk that's at least as big as you currently have, then try installing the same OS and then using Migration Assistant to copy the data from your current disk (A) to the new one (B). Boot from B and see if you get the same error message. (The process should take about 1 hour for OS install, 2 hours for Migration. Ish)/li /ol  hope you can figure something out.  <answer282813> The solution to disabling the "almost full" and "full" notification is to disable the daemon responsible for it:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.diskspaced.plist /code/pre  Alternatively, if you only want to prevent the "almost full" from appearing so often then you can lower the GB threshold via:  precodeminFreeSpace (int) - minimal free size in GB. Default: 20 /code/pre  The default 20GB is too high for small SSDs and a possible bug causes the alert to be shown every day rather than just once, so as a workaround you can lower the free space before the alert appears, e.g. to 10GB:  precodedefaults write com.apple.diskspaced minFreeSpace 10 /code/pre  The daemon only reads its prefs on startup so you need to restart it if you have system integrity turned off:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.diskspaced.plist launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.diskspaced.plist /code/pre  Otherwise kill it:  precodekillall diskspaced /code/pre  In case you are interested in the other preferences for these disk alerts you can view some of them using the help param:  precode/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/StorageManagement.framework/Versions/A/Resources/diskspaced help ---   Domain: com.apple.diskspaced   Supported keys:   debugLog (BOOL) - log additional debug information. Default: NO   checkAllVolumes (BOOL) - check all volumes. Default: NO   minDiskSize (int) - minimal disk size in GB. Default: 128   minFreeSpace (int) - minimal free size in GB. Default: 20   minPurgeableSpace (int) - minimal purgeabe space size in GB. Default: 20 ---   Commands: removeAllNotifications - Removes all scheduled and delivered user notificiations. /code/pre  And here are a couple of hidden ones:  precodewarningInterval (integer default 0) lastWarningDate (string e.g. 2017-05-05 16:48:29 +0000) /code/pre  I didn't look too closely at but it is possible setting the last warning date to a date in the future would also prevent the alert displaying.  <answer294132> h3Disabling on macOS Sierra and beyond/h3  On Sierra this command didn't work for me:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.diskspaced.plist /code/pre  due to emSystem Integrity Protection/em engaged, so to stop the codediskspaced/code service, run:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.diskspaced /code/pre  supNote: Use codestart/code to start again or codelist/code to see the details (e.g. its codePID/code)./sup  If the service is restarting after a while, try the following command to stop it:  precodekillall -STOP diskspaced /code/pre  hr  h3Changing warning level and interval/h3  To change the user's default settings, here are some example commands:  precodedefaults write com.apple.diskspaced freeSpaceWarningLevel 1 defaults write com.apple.diskspaced warningInterval 3600 defaults write com.apple.diskspaced debugLog 1 defaults write com.apple.diskspaced checkAllVolumes 0 /code/pre  Then restart the service:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.diskspaced &amp;&amp; launchctl start com.apple.diskspaced /code/pre  To see the loaded settings, run codediskspaced/code, e.g.:  precode$(find /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks -name diskspaced -print -quit) 2017-08-04 18:32:27.943 diskspaced[92401:12312556] FreeSpaceWarningLevel: 1 2017-08-04 18:32:27.943 diskspaced[92401:12312556] WarningInterval: 3600 2017-08-04 18:32:27.943 diskspaced[92401:12312556] Check All Volumes: NO /code/pre  h3Notes/h3  I believe parameters mentioned by @malhal no longer exist. Here is a simple command to test this:  precode$ grep -A6 debugLog &lt;(strings $(find /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks -name diskspaced -print -quit)) debugLog freeSpaceWarningLevel FreeSpaceWarningLevel: %ld warningInterval WarningInterval: %ld checkAllVolumes Check All Volumes: %@ /code/pre  h3Troubleshooting/h3  Check the logs by this command for any warnings:  precodegrep com.apple.diskspaced /var/log/system.log /code/pre  <comment330145> The same here: "You only have 17.57 GB of storage. Save space by optimizing storage." on my Macbook Pro flash storage. Ridiculous. <comment339949> There's a system process called `deleted` that purges caches and whenever it does, it sends a `CACHE_DELETE_PURGEABLE_UPDATED` distributed notification to all apps. Whenever that notification is sent, the "Your disk is almost full" notification shows up, so I think it's a bug in some app that's listening for that distributed notification. <comment346410> A few suggestion, though some make me cringe. But, when things are annoying, sometimes you have to try them. <comment346505> I don't need more space, and the current file usage is reasonable. I just want the notification to stop, because it is premature. <comment346610> I understand that, but sometimes computers get a bit wonky and actively *doing* something - like moving, deleting, re-creating, etc. - can jog the system back into doing the right thing, even if "nothing has changed."  I'm just trying to offer suggestions to help you troubleshoot and/or solve the problem. <comment347220> Excuse me, but why the downvotes? The suggestions are real and ones I've done in the past when nothing else seemed to be working. I prefaced my reply saying it was desperate measures.... <comment347249> @inket How does one watch these notifications?
