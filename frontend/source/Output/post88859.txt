And is your concern whether it's possible to make an operating system run on hardware not listed as supported, or whether it will reliably run on all the listed hardware? Also, your tags suggest you're talking about OS X Mountain Lion, but the body of the question doesn't. The answer may indeed vary whether you're talking about iOS or OS X and what version thereof. <comment104177> @DanielLawson Clarified. <comment104178> The linked page lists a lot of requirements, which specific one troubles you? <comment104181> @patrix I want know if I can get away with installing it on a mini older than 2009. Nothing specific in mind. I'm browsing eBay. <comment104182> Then please update your question accordingly to get useable answers. Otherwise it is awfully broad.
