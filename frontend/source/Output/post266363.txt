Keep having to reset SMC to get MBA to start <body> This happens quite frequently, and even having done the alt-option-shift and start method of resetting SMC it still won't turn on.  Is this a battery problem, a shutdown problem, or something else? I'm up to date with apps, although I haven't installed macOS Sierra (still running Yosemite).  <comment333994> What is your battery life like? (How long does your battery last?) How many cycles are on it? Have you run Apple Hardware Test? What were the results?
