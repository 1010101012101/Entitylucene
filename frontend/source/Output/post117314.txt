How to run programs from an external hard drive on MacBook Pro? <body> I need to know how to install and run applications from an external hard drive on my MacBook Pro.  <answer117319> You just need to copy the application to the external drive. Mac apps can actually run from anywhere, it is merely convention to keep them in the /Applications folder.  Of course all the preferences will still be in your home Library folder but the app will be on the external drive.  <comment137106> You might clarify this a bit.  Are you wanting to install the third party applications in a way that they reside on the external hard drive or are you wanting to run the MacBook Pro from a system on the external hard drive?
