iTunes 11: Default Podcast settings <body> I would like to change the default settings for all podcasts.   I know you can edit each one of them individually, but I would like to change the default for all to "Download All" and  keep "All episodes".  <answer84129> ul liRight-click on any podcast and select emSettings/em. Or if you are in list view, select the settings button in the lower-left corner:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cIBT2.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liIn the emSettings for:/em drop-down list, select emPodcast Defaults/em, then select emDownload all/em and emAll episodes/em:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NuPhA.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liMake sure that all of your desired podcasts are using the new default settings by selecting each one from the drop-down list and checking that the  emUse Default Settings/em checkbox is checked:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6xAG.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjXT0.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Update:/h2  iTunes 11.1.2 adds a new dialog for changing podcast settings. Select strongSettings/strong and select strongDefaults.../strong to change the default podcast settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GrstE.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Update:/h2  In iTunes 12.4.3.1 go to codePodcasts/code, and click codeDefaults/code at the bottom of the list of your podcasts. Then you can set the default settings for all your podcasts (changed settings will also apply to existing ones if they're still set to default settings).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGBII.png" alt="screenshot" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/coOva.png" alt="screenshot" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WHSDY.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer179375> patrix,  Try selecting NONE of the podcasts. Click on an empty spot in iTunes and then change "Settings..." That should change the defaults for podcasts you subscribe to in the future.  <comment97131> Legend! Thanks Bryan. <comment110675> For cryin' out loud. I can't believe how far they buried this down. <comment124441> The latest version of iTunes 11 changed this dialog completely. There is no "Settings for:" selector anymore, the dialog only contains settings for the selected podcast. *Now* how do we set the default settings?!! :-P
