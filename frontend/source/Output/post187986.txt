Custom keyboard I created with ukalele not working <body> I created a custom layout with Ukalele. This file is here: http://www.filedropper.com/koray1  The filename is: koray1.keylayout  I copied this file to /Library/Keyboard Layouts  However I do not see it available for selecting:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8yBMz.png" alt="enter image description here"  What am I doing wrong?  <answer188024> The Keyboard Name is not set correctly.  It duplicates one already in use by the system.  Instead you should make it koray1.  <comment222365> Did you login/logout?  Check the Other category?  Use the same thing for the Keyboard Name?  In any case, a good place to ask for help is the Ukelele group  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ukelele-users <comment222366> @TomGewecke Yes I did restart, logout login etc.. Nothing works. <comment222382> But your keyboard name is not Koray.  It's Turkish qwerty pc, which duplicates one already present in the system.  Try fixing that. <comment222397> @TomGewecke how do I change the name of the keyboard <comment222408> Look in the Ukelele menus for an item like Set Keyboard Name. <comment222412> @TomGewecke Thank you very much, this solved it.
