Automator > modifying an URL before downloading it? <body> I'm trying to automate a download process for images on multiple webpages.  So far, my actions are :   ol li"Ask for text"  i paste multiple URLs/li li"Extract URLs from Text"/li li"Get Image URLs from Webpage" (I get all images)/li li"Filter URLs" (I filter the one i want, for instance the ones ending with "_small.jpg") /li li"Download URLs"./li /ol  It works fine, but I'd like to download the images ending with "_large.jpg", which are not present on the webpages I submit in 1).  So how would I go from 4) to 5) while changing the URL, i.e. replacing "_small.jpg" by "_large.jpg" ?  Thank you  <answer96052> Using shell scripting, you could do something like this:  precodewget $(curl $(&lt;urls.txt) | grep -o 'http[^"]*_small.jpg' | sed 's/_small/_large/') /code/pre  <comment112760> `wget` is not installed by default as far as I know <comment112766> What language are you scripting this in?
