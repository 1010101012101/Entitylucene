Safari 6 “Debug” menu: explain choices? <body> There are certain menu items in the Safari 6 Debug menu which I want to understand.    First, I’ll list the menu items; then, the information I would like to know for each of the items; and finally, I’ll post screenshots of the Debug menu and its submenus for context.  br  h1Specific menu items I’m interested in:/h1  ul listrongUse Buffered Windows/strong/li listrongUse Single-process Windows/strong/li liAll items under strongDrawing/Compositing Flags ►/strong/li liAll items under strongMiscellaneous Flags ►/strong/li /ul  br  h1Wanted Information/h1  ul liwhat the menu item does/li liuse cases where it would help performance/li liuse cases where it would hinder performance/li liuse cases where performance would probably not be affected/li /ul  br  h1Screenshots of the strongDebug/strong Menu/h1  Screenshots from Safari 6.  ul listrongDebug/strong:brimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cwo7U.png" alt="Safari 6 Debug menu screenshot"/li li(submenu) strongDrawing/Compositing Flags ►/strong:brimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUmaP.png" alt="Drawing/Compositing Flags submenu"/li li(submenu) strongMiscellaneous Flags ►/strong:brimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pJtDT.png" alt="Miscellaneous Flags submenu"/li /ul  <answer74100> strongUse Buffered Windows/strong : br / br / for each window, there will be another window that is off screen. The reason for this is that when the window the user is interacting with needs updating (ie, you move the mouse over the window) the WindowServer simply needs to copy the damaged region from the offscreen window and blast it over to the visible one. Similarly when the content of your window changes, applications are only supposed to update the region that changed. This drawing is performed on the buffer, which then is copied over to the 'visible' window. br /br / strongUse Single-process Windows/strong: br / br / puts all open tabs inside a single safari proccess instead of several ones.  <comment87001> Thanks so much for your helpful answer!  I appreciate it.  Two things: (1) I take it that means that default behavior is for each Safari window to get its own process—correct? (2) Do you know anything about the items under **Drawing/Compositing Flags** or **Miscellaneous Flags** menus? <comment87151> unfortuantly i don't know alot about it, thats why i've made it into a community wiki. i will ask around if some people can help you with this <comment161706> @Zearin in case you haven't already seen it, check for details about process/window mapping here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106866/has-anyone-figured-out-how-to-identify-the-unique-page-of-each-separate-safari-w
