How to send only "work" related requests over vpn for El Capitan (10.11) <body> I have configured a new VPN connection (Type - Cisco IPSec) for work using network preferences and it works.  How can I stay connected to my codework vpn/code and direct only my codework traffic/code through vpn?  Given that I already know that all of my work related requests fall under specific ip-range say, code10.0.0.0/8/code, how can I direct my non-work web traffic to not use the work vpn?  If possible, please provide an effective way to verify the setup as well.  <answer237147> You should talk to the VPN administrator.  Typically, the decision about what traffic is routed to your network is made by the VPN server since there are security implications to allowing the device to send only some traffic down the tunnel.  We use Cisco VPN and we do not allow clients to do what you describe because it opens a potential hole in our network security.    <comment290121> Related and potential answer: http://superuser.com/questions/4904/how-to-selectively-route-network-traffic-through-vpn-on-mac-os-x-leopard <comment290307> ^^ tried that already.
