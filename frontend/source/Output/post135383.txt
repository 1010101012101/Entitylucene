What is the quickest way to send some text from desktop\laptop to iPhone? <body> I usually send emails to myself, but I wonder if there is a better way to share something quickly from my PC\laptop to iPhone.  <answer135389> I usually use notes or reminders which sync over iCloud. If you are using Windows + iPhone you could try using something like Evernote. It avoids your mailbox from cluttering up, but I doubt it's any quicker than mailing.  <answer135423> If you are on Mavericks, notes has iCloud support.  However, I prefer Evernote. It's available for all major platforms.  <answer135425> h2Scribe/h2  I haven't used Scribe, but it does look promising. Install their app on your Mac and its companion app on your iPhone, then press kbdcommand/kbd kbdshift/kbd kbdX/kbd to send the text selected on your Mac to your iPhone. The iOS app keeps a history of sent items too.  <answer135438> I use Messages - it is built-in to OSX and you can drag and drop text and images really easily.  <comment160519> Quicker or more easy? What do you use it for? <comment160606> Can you expand on this? Who do you send messages to? <comment160607> Myself! That is, either to my iPhone number or my Email address on which my iPhone receives iMessages. I press the `Compose new message` button at the top of `Messages` and fill in the `To` field with my own number or Email address, then I can drag images and drop them onto `Messages`, or paste text into the message window at the bottom. <comment160608> Cool! I didn't know you could send them to yourself. Good tip. <comment160623> @Dillon You can vote for my answer if you like it ;-)
