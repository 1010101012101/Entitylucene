How do I re-enable double tap to highlight on my trackpad? <body> I recently did a fresh install of 10.8. Prior to this install, I could rapidly tap twice on my touchpad and, on the second tap, drag the pointer to highlight text. Now, with this new install, that feature is missing. I tried looking in the trackpad settings but couldn't find anything to re-enable this feature.  <answer64671> I have searched all locations which come to mind for enabling such a setting, but without success:  ul liSystem Preferences &#x2192; Trackpad/li liSystem Preferences &#x2192; Accessibility &#x2192; Keyboard/li liSystem Preferences &#x2192; Keyboard/li /ul  Therefore, I suggest the following alternative:br strongSystem Preferences&#x2192;Trackpad&#x2192;Point &amp; Click&#x2192;Three Finger Drag/strong  This way you can highlight text without delay by using three finger touch. If you need to highlight lots of text, you can release one of the three fingers and continue to move the cursor down with that finger.  <answer79072> Here is the answer to your question:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong/li liSelect strongAccessibility/strong/li liSelect strongMouse &amp; Trackpad/strong/li liSelect strongTrackpad Options/strong/li liSelect strongEnable dragging withoug Drag Lock/strong/li /ol  <answer81262> I was annoyed myself, and found out the answer in the end:  ol liSystem Preferences  Universal Access  Mouse and Trackpad  Trackpad Options/li liClick the check box that says "Dragging" and you should be all set./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ehL3B.png" alt="enter image description here"  For more details see this CNET article.  By the way, the exact method to perform this action has changed slightly with Mountain Lion.  <comment75958> What I think is even better is the option *Three Finger Drag* in **System Preferences-Trackpad**. This way you can highlight text without delay. If you need to highlight lots of text, you can release one of the three fingers and continue to move the cursor down with that finger. <comment75963> @gentmatt You should make that an answer. It's clearly the best option. <comment76065> It's nice that there's an alternative but I'm really looking to enable my existing behavior since it's instinctive and I'm annoyed every time it doesn't work. <comment91395> While trying to figure this out I unselected tap to click in trackpad settings which disabled your 5th step. I use accessibility daily and never enabled the accessibility option, till messing with the trackpad options. odd <comment167268> Just did this on 10.9. Dialog looks different of course but works just fine. <comment195067> @gentmatt I personaly find that the three finger drag is unusable compared to OP's question.
