Keep two Macports installations in sync <body> I've got two Macs, an iMac and a Macbook Pro. I do web development work on both, my data is synced with a local cloud solution. But how do I keep my Macports installations in sync? At the moment I try two manually install the very same packages, but with all the port variants I'd hope for a more sophisticated solution.  <answer146572> You could pipe the output of codeport echo active/code to a file on one machine, sync the output to the other machine, and run codeport install/code for each line.  That would be just the most naive solution, mainly not handling "merge conflicts".
