how to turn off my keyboard on my macbook? <body> the "a" button is busted and behaves as if it's constantly being pressed down. I have a wired keyboard ready to use but I can't figure out how to turn off the keyboard here. I tried codeControl/code + codeF1/code after enabling "Use all F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys" but that's not doing anything.  This "a" problem is making it incredibly difficult to code.  <answer286259> You can try 2 options  ol liThis free app KeyboardCleanTool, I do not have an external keyboard so I don't know if it disables too./li liRunning the following commands.   ul liDisable:  precodesudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/ /code/pre/li liEnable:  precodesudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBTopCase.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBTCKeyboard.kext/ /code/pre/li /ul/li /ol  Although when you disable the keyboard the following message shows up, the keyboard remains disabled:  precode(kernel) Can't unload kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard; classes have instances: (kernel)     Kext com.apple.driver.AppleUSBTCKeyboard class AppleUSBTCKeyboard has 1 instance.

There's an option under the devices menu to disable the build-in keyboard while another keyboard is selected, which should do exactly what you want.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tk4TV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment361124> By the way I'm using macOS Sierra 10.12.5
