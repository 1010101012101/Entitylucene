Why can't I use iCloud to backup? <body> I am trying to sync my iPad running iOS 8.0.2 with my iCloud account and it keeps telling me that I need more space. I have deleted everything I can and deselected every single app from the backup but it still says I need 5.1gb of space.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZqgY.jpg" alt="Screen Shot showing 5gb free and 5.1gb needed"  If I try clicking back up I get the following error  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fgWI3.jpg" alt="iCloud fail error message"  I have only one device, my iPad, linked to iCloud. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  <comment174117> If you go to "Show all Apps", are there any left which are selected? <comment174158> Hi @patrix, no, I have deselected every app in the list.
