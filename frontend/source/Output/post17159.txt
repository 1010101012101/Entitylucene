Newer generations have better battery life. This should be slightly more (+2 to +4 hours) than the video playback battery life of the device listed below:  ul li1st generation: 5 hrs/li li2nd generation: 6 hrs/li li3rd generation: 6 hrs/li li4th generation: 7 hrs/li /ul  It is modest in comparison to the battery life the kindle has.  precodeDoes iTouch Kindle have the english dictionary function like Amazon Kindle? /code/pre  Yes it does. When you need to look up a word, select it and long press. The first time, the dictionary will download over a wi-fi connection. The second time on, it will look up the word without the need of an internet connection. Personnally, I've found the dictionary to not be very extensive.  precodeDoes iTouch Kindle also support audible? /code/pre  Not sure what you're asking for here. I've never used a feature that has read out the content to me from the Kindle iPod touch and haven't seen an option for it either.  precodeWhich device is easier to use and read? /code/pre  Definitely the Kindle device, since you're comparing which is better to read with.  precodeAre there other differences between Amazon Kindle3 and iTouch Kindle? /code/pre  ul liSupported formats: The iPod touch Kindle 2.7 doesn't support common formats like epub and pdf./li liReadability: The Kindle is larger and more suitable for reading. It's E Ink Pearl technology which displays everything in gray-scale, reduces glare and doesn't strain the eyes during long uses./li liAdditional functions: The iPod touch can do much more that be a e-book reader. The number of apps available on the app store extends it capability. You also have the option to replace the Kindle on the iPod touch with other e-book reader apps like iBooks./li /ul  <comment18670> ummm they are two completely different devices. No comparison at all. http://www.blogkindle.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/kindle-and-iphone.jpg <comment18722> Thank you very much for your good and helpful answer! Audible is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible.com . I heard that Amazon Kindle started to support it recently. But I haven't used it yet. I agree it's very important that the device `doesn't strain the eyes during long uses`. But iTouch is smaller and more portable and I can use iTouch easily even during brushing teeth, eating lunch, or walking. So if possible I wanna replace Amazon Kindle with iTouch Kindle. <comment18723> Cool. But I'm recommending the iBooks app as well (for pdf and epub formats). Try it.
