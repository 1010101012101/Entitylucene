How to encrypt zip file and filenames via command line? <body> Using command line on Mac, I know that I can encrypt a directory with the following command:  precodezip -er Directory.zip /path/to/directory /code/pre  However, this does not encrypt the filenames themselves. If someone runs:  precodeunzip Directory.zip /code/pre  and repeatedly enters a wrong password, the unzip command will loop through all of the contained filenames until the correct password is entered. Sample output:  precodeunzip Directory.zip  Archive:  Directory.zip    creating: Directory/ [Directory.zip] Directory/sensitive-file-name-1 password:  password incorrect--reenter:  password incorrect--reenter:     skipping: Directory/sensitive-file-name-1  incorrect password [Directory.zip] Directory/sensitive-file-name-2 password:  password incorrect--reenter:  password incorrect--reenter:     skipping: Directory/sensitive-file-name-2  incorrect password [Directory.zip] Directory/sensitive-file-name-3 password:  password incorrect--reenter:  password incorrect--reenter:     skipping: Directory/sensitive-file-name-3  incorrect password /code/pre  and so on.  Using command line on Mac, is there a way to zip a directory with encryption while also encrypting or hiding the filenames themselves?  Thank you.
