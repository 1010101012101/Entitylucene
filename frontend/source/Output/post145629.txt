Tumblr mail notification in ipad <body> For reblog likes and new follower instill got the notification but why not for new mail or new ask? I mean I can not get any notifications when I receive a new fanmail and ask or answers from my tumblr, I only get notification for reblog, likes, and new followers, but tumblr app in iPad is always like never let me know when I get fanmail in my inbox, so sometimes it's annoying since friends ask something then I just don't know if there's something comes into my tumblr inbox.  Can I get these additional notifications using tumblr with my iPad running iOS 7?  <comment171654> I'm in iOS 7 but yea still no notification for tumblr inbox and yeah I'm clueless
