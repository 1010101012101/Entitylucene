How do I sync contacts between 2 iCloud accounts with iOS 8? <body> I have one iCloud account, and my wife has another.  I have an iPhone, and so does she.  It's easy to share calendars in iOS 8, and I'd like to do something similar with our contacts.  How can we keep our contacts synchronized between the two accounts/devices?  <answer148364> Found this on a forum today.  Suppose a husband and wife want to share contacts.  In codeSettings &gt; iCloud/code, the husband adds his account.  In it, he emmust/em sync contacts; he can also sync whatever else he wants.  In codeSettings &gt; iCloud/code, the wife adds her account.  In it, she emcannot/em sync contacts, but she can sync whatever else she wants.  In codeSettings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars/code, she adds her husband's account. In it, the emonly/em thing she syncs is contacts.  That's it.   <answer261847> We have found the best way to share contacts and keep them synced in real time is to both use the same icloud account.  <comment327920> Hello Richard, welcome to Stack Exchange. As it stands, your answer is pretty hard to follow; could you edit it to add some line breaks and remove information that is irrelevant to the question?
