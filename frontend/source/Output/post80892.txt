Font smoothing randomly turning off <body> Recently my fonts turned a little too "crispy" in the sense that they looked a somewhat flattened and pixely. Exactly this problem, in fact:  Weird Font Smoothing Issue  After noticing it, I went ahead and typed the default smoothing into Terminal.  http://osxdaily.com/2012/06/09/mac-screen-blurry-optimize-troubleshoot-font-smoothing-os-x/  Ever since then it's been fine, but it has happened again. I was on Snow Leopard (when it first happened) and now am on Mountain Lion. Is there any way I could permanently set it so this doesn't happen again? Perhaps there is a corrupt preference file or something like that I could replace?  I recently did a Hackintosh build for my friend and he had the same issue upon install. The command in Terminal fixed it, but I never excepted this kind of a thing to happen on my Macbook Proâ€“ let alone nearly 4 years after having it.
