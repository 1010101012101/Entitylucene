Can I pair an iPhone 4S to Apple TV? <body> Can I pair an iPhone 4S to Apple TV (no longer activated with Verizon) or can I connect the iPhone strongdirectly/strong to Apple TV to get an HDMI output?  <answer201988> As far as I know, that is impossible. But, you can use the Lightning to HDMI adapter or AirPlay to an Apple TV.  <comment243577> Define "pair". If you mean stream videos and music to it, then yes, you can definitely do that. It's called Airplay and you access it in Control Center.
