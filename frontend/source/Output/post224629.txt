How can I run a shell script with admin privileges from Applescript? <body> I am writing an Applescript that aims to automate the install (add to root keychain) and 'Always Trust' setting by simply launching the Applescript. I'm stuck with how to get the admin user authenticated with the authentication popup?  Here is my code so far:  precodetry     set question to display dialog "To Install Click 'Continue'" &amp; return &amp; "You will be prompted to enter an administartor password!" buttons {"Close", "Continue"} default button 2     set answer to button returned of question     if answer is equal to "Continue" then         do shell script ("sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Desktop/MyWiFiCertificate.crt")     else if answer is equal to "Close" then         display dialog "You have cancelled the WiFi Certificate installation." buttons {"Exit"} default button 1     end if on error errorMsg     display dialog errorMsg end try /code/pre  However, I get this error  precodesudo: no tty present and no askpass program specified". /code/pre  I'm guessing it is because of the fact that the operation can not be authenticated by the admin user. I'd be grateful if anyone who has automated this process before could refine my code to enable the user to authenticate and automatically 'Always Trust' the WiFi Certificate.  <answer224640> You can pass administrator privileges to a line of AppleScript which requires administrator privileges by appending "with administrator privileges":  precodedo shell script "security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Desktop/MyWiFiCertificate.crt" with administrator privileges /code/pre  <comment272437> The answers to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/156544/how-to-open-a-shell-script-in-a-new-terminal-window-and-run-it-with-administrato might help here. <comment272463> Is `sudo` still required then? <comment272464> @patrix Yes, not ever investigated why though. Guess that's something I could look into and add into this answer. <comment272519> @grgarside That seems to have solved it for me, I now get the authentication prompt and looking at the Keychain it is set to 'Always Trust' just as I wanted. But I can't see where in the command it defines 'Always Trust'? <comment272543> @grgarside Sudo is definitely NOT required. Apple specifically recommends against using it in conjunction with "with administrator privileges". Quoted from https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2065/_index.html : Note: Using sudo(8) with with administrator privileges is generally unnecessary and creates security holes; simply remove the "sudo". <comment272580> @William Fair enough, thanks! <comment272581> @Pro It's "Always Trust" unless you specifically specify otherwise.
