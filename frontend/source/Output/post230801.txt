Unlocking and locking mac screen via ssh <body> Is there a way to unlock and lock screen from command line, via ssh? I know code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend/code command, but it doesn't seem to work via ssh. The perfect solution would be a command, that I could type logged via ssh and it would unlock the screen or lock it back again, so I don't need to tell anybody my password, if he wants to use it. Is there any builtin tool, that would provide such functionality?  <answer230912> There are many ways to lock and unlock your Mac via SSH. The easiest and probably the fastest way is to use codeosascript/code (applescript).   h2Locking Mac/h2  To do this, log in via ssh and type in  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to sleep' /code/pre  You can switch Finder for System Events, but that means more characters to type.  h2Unlocking Mac/h2  To wake your Mac is a little harder.  There are two ways to do this.  You can use codeosascript/code again.  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to key code 123' /code/pre  This tells it to keystroke the left arrow key which should wake your Mac up from sleep.  You can also use the codepmset/code command.   precodepmset schedule wake "mm/dd/yyyy 00:00:00" /code/pre  Use a date and time that has already passed.  Of course you will need to keystroke your password via Applescript, e.g.  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "System Events" keystroke "password"' /code/pre  An alternative to this could be the Remote Wake Up app for Mac, but I am not sure if you can put a password in.  <comment281978> I know, about the ability to make osx sleep remotely. I have been looking for something, that will just lock the screen, not put the computer to sleep. Something like win + L on windows, but via ssh. Also, I cant get to work this unlocking script. <comment338935> Check [this answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/159440/221083) (I'm using this method, and it works flawlessly).
