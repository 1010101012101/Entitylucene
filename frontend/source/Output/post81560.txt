Unable to start Dropbox due to permission errors <body> I installed Dropbox 1.6.16 and am running OS 10.7.5 (Lion). I continue to get this message and don't know how to fix:     Couldn't start Dropbox      This is usually because of permissions error. Errors can also be caused by your home folder being stored on a network share.   I am the only person using this Mac and I don't have a network so this message doesn't make sense to me.  How can I get Dropbox to work for me?  <answer81562> Have you tried any of the following?  ol liReinstall Dropbox. /li liRepair Permissions/li liCreate a new user on your computer and try dropbox from there?/li /ol  Otherwise a closer inspection to the System.log might help.  <answer81586> Are you an administrator? If you are, try Chown and Chmod  Type the following into Terminal:  codesudo chown -R yourUsername /Users/yourusername/Dropbox/code  codesudo chmod -R 700 /Users/yourusername/Dropbox/code  If that doesn't work I'd run codediskutil repairPermissions //code  If those don't work, I would reinstall Dropbox.  <answer81587> Try starting Dropbox using the command line.  ul liOpen Terminal (search for 'Terminal' in Spotlight)./li liType codecd /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/code then press kbdReturn/kbd./li liType code./Dropbox/code then press kbdReturn/kbd./li liReport back with any error messages./li /ul  If you want to try something else while you are waiting for us to get back to you, repeat the above commands, with the exception of codeopen Dropbox/code. Instead, continue on with the following steps:  ul liType codecd /Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS//code. (Just press kbdReturn/kbd at the end of every command...)/li liType codels -la/code. You should see four records. We are interested in the bottom two. To the left of "Dropbox" and "python", you should see code-rwxr-xr-x/code. These are the permissions for the files. If the pattern you see doesn't match what I have posted here, there is a problem with the permissions. (If so, report back here for the next step. If not, keep going through this list.)/li liIf the permissions were fine in the previous step, we can check a few other places. Type codecd ..//code to return to the above directory./li liType codecd Frameworks/code./li liType codels -la/code. The top two files (with actual names) should have the permissions codedrwxr-xr-x/code. The bottom three files should have the permissions code-rwxr-xr-x/code. (Report back if they are different.)/li liType codecd ..//code again./li liType codels -la/code. The permissions this time shouldn't make much difference to the app, but we may as well check them. They should be as follows:  precode drwxr-xr-x   9 user  admin   306 30 Jan 12:59 . drwxr-xr-x@  3 user  admin   102 30 Jan 12:59 .. lrwxr-xr-x   1 user  admin    28 30 Jan 12:59 CodeResources - _CodeSignature/CodeResources drwxr-xr-x   7 user  admin   238 30 Jan 12:59 Frameworks -rw-r--r--   1 user  admin  2647 21 Jan 09:09 Info.plist drwxr-xr-x   4 user  admin   136 21 Jan 09:09 MacOS -rw-r--r--   1 user  admin     8 21 Jan 09:09 PkgInfo drwxr-xr-x  74 user  admin  2516 21 Jan 09:09 Resources drwxr-xr-x   3 user  admin   102 21 Jan 09:09 _CodeSignature /code/pre/li liOnce again, if you notice any of the permissions are different, let me know which ones are different, and I will give you detailed instructions on how to change them./li /ul  <answer86296> From http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20130315064419386     It turns out that Dropbox has a hidden feature to fix such things. Open the Dropbox preferences, click on Account, then press the Option key. The Unlink This Computer button will change to Fix Permissions. Click that button and let Dropbox go through your files.   <answer132594> All you have to do is:  ol liUnlock home user/li liRight click on home user name and click on emGet info/em/li liGo to emGeneral/em and un-tick strongLocked/strong/li liHope your dropbox work as usual/li /ol  <answer157183> I had same problem. This helped me to fix issue:  Remove hidden dropbox folder '.dropbox' in user's root folder (Users/YourUsername/.dropbox)  You can do it by running this command in terminal:  precodesudo rm -r .dropbox /code/pre  Then simply erase everything what is left in Applications folder and make a fresh install.  I found this solution here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6318381  <answer158959> I saw the same error message and had the same issue where Dropbox wouldn't start on my laptop so I couldn't access the hidden Fix Permissions feature. I tried fixing the permissions manually with Terminal. I also tried uninstalling and installing. I also tried removing the code.dropbox/code folder in my root folder. Nothing worked.  Finally, unlinking and relinking my laptop remotely via the Dropbox website fixed it. When I started Dropbox again, I signed in and my Dropbox folder started syncing again. Article on Dropbox's help site walks through the steps and has suggestions for how to relink the files if the Dropbox location has changed.  Good luck!  <comment184710> The problem is Dropbox won't start, yet your solution requires that you start Dropbox? How did this get upvoted? <comment184798> please specify in your answer what to erase in the application folder! <comment186862> @scaba Perhaps this other answer explains how to unlink better from the dropbox web site... http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/158959/5472
