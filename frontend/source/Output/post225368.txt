OSX 10.11 incorrectly sees application as powerPC <body> I have built and successfully run an application on codeOSX 10.11/code. Then I decided to create a bundle for the app and launched it successfully.  Then I moved the bundle to the codeApplications/code folder and it did not start anymore displaying the popup:     'You can’t open the application “CodeBlocks” because PowerPC applications are no longer supported'   Obviously this isn't a PowerPC application.  Renaming the app, copying it to other locations restarting the mac did not solve the issue.  I'm using:      MacBook Air (13-inch Mid 2011), OS X El Capitan (10.11.3)   How can I prevent this error from being thrown?  <answer261750> strongI reproduced this error on OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 and found a workaround:/strong  Error:     You can't open the application "Open_todo_in_vim" because PowerPC applications are no longer supported   Picture: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ywe23.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow to Reproduce the error:/strong  Full reproduction instructions found here: https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/shell-script-mac-apps  strongJist:/strong  Save this as appify.sh  precode#!/usr/bin/env bash  APPNAME=${2:-$(basename "${1}" '.sh')}; DIR="${APPNAME}.app/Contents/MacOS";  if [ -a "${APPNAME}.app" ]; then     echo "${PWD}/${APPNAME}.app already exists :(";     exit 1; fi;  mkdir -p "${DIR}"; cp "${1}" "${DIR}/${APPNAME}"; chmod +x "${DIR}/${APPNAME}";  echo "${PWD}/$APPNAME.app"; /code/pre  Save it as /usr/local/bin/appify.sh, which requires root privileges give it executable permissions and then run it like so:  precode$ appify your-shell-script.sh "Your App Name" /code/pre  Double click on "Your App Name".    Observe the error shown above.  h2Why is this annoying error happening?/h2  It's a combination of many reasons:  ol liSafety: The developers over at Apple are fighting cybercrime with scripts in the background replacing your docked items.  Roadblocks make successful viruses of yesteryear hit a brick wall.  This is one of those walls./li liMoney: The developers over at Apple want you to use their applications, not the applications you found over the internet because every app you use is a potential attack vector from unscrupulous developers worldwide./li liProtecting users from themselves: Apple developers only want power users to created docked items, you don't want novices figuring out "Hey!  Anyone can drag codesome_low_level_guts_script.sh/code to the OSX dock and it solves my problem!  Apple prevents this for the same reason parents keep bleach under the sink behind locked doors when toddlers are around.  /li /ol  h2Hacky Workaround so you can run your script without the PowerPC application error:/h2  I found the answer that explains how to execute Shell Scripts from the OS X Dock here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21048589/445131  strongJist of Hacky workaround/strong  ol liCreate your shell script codewhatever.sh/code/li liMake your shell script executable./li liRename your whatever.sh to have a code.app/code suffix: codewhatever.sh.app/code/li liDrag codewhatever.sh.app/code to the OSX dock./li liRename your script back to codewhatever.sh/code./li liRight-click the file in Finder, and click the "Get Info" option./li liAt the bottom of the window, set the shell script to open with the terminal./li /ol  And the error mentioned at top no longer occurs.  Double clicking the file on the OSX dock runs the shell script as expected without error.  <comment273449> This happened to me, only with Spotify. I couldn't fix it either... <comment273478> Maybe try to restart Your Mac or move this app out of `Applications` directory. This is probably ElCapitan bug. <comment273479> I have done both, it didn't work <comment327767> The reasons don't make sense there are many open source apps which are free
