MacBook 12" mirroring on iMac <body> I have an old MacBook Air, which, when using Thunderbolt cable, I am able to mirror the screen on my iMac.  However, I cannot do the same for my newer MacBook 12".  Any ideas?  <answer234634> Ensure that under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Displays &gt; Arrangement/code (this tab emonly/em shows up strongif your computer detects an external display/strong), the "Mirror Displays" checkbox at the bottom is checked.  This checkbox determines whether your secondary display will act as an "extension" or as a mirror of your primary.  <comment286981> What I mean is that there is no cabling that allows this and not a software related problem. <comment286984> There might be external third party USB-C to VGA, or USB-C to Thunderbolt (which you can adapt to Thunderbolt to VGA) <comment287203> still does not make me see from the macbook 12 inch on the imac
