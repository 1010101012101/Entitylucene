How do I automatically reconnect to wifi when the connection is lost? <body> I'm on OS X 10.6. When I'm downloading a torrent, the connection is sometimes lost.  And because of this, the download stops too, and the only solution I found to reconnect is to manually turn off the WiFi and turn it back on.  Is there a program or trick to restore the network connection automatically?   <answer13550> While this doesn't solve your problem immediately, I can say that I had the exact same issue with my iMac and OS X 10.6. My solution? Get a new router. From that point on, the wireless connection was emfar/em more stable, and while the issue itself exists (say I make a lot of changes in the router that requires the connection to drop -- my iMac won't always reconnect), the router itself seems to make a big deal in the connectivity. (I went after one of the newer N routers; my previous router was a G router.)  Other things to try (before shelling out $$$):  ul liMake sure your router's firmware is up-to-date (Mine was, unfortunately)/li liSee if you can install a custom firmware (like DD-WRT) that might solve the problem (this is really dependent upon router type, so not all routers are supported)/li /ul  <comment14402> Before buying a new router - you should check that your current router has the latest software applied. I had a Netgear router previously that lost wifi connections regularly - once I applied latest software - it ran for months without issues. <comment14442> Good idea; I'd forgot to mention that. For my router, it was already on the latest firmware, and since it was a b/g device and I wanted to have N speeds for the Mac, I figured it was time to upgrade anyway.
