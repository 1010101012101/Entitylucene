Transferring from a Samsung Galaxy to a Mac <body> Is it ok to connect a Samsung Galaxy to a Mac for transferring photos? I'm not sure if it is ok to do this with two different brands.  <answer263593> Yes it is 100% fine. You can use whatever software you want to do the transfer.  <answer265922> I also have a galaxy and a mac, and it doesn't work for me. I'd recommend this mimic of airdrop, called Airdroid. Very straightforward. You go to  http://web.airdroid.com/ then install the app on your galaxy, scan a QR code displayed on the website then transfer whatever. Logins optional, whole process takes 2-3 minutes each time.  <answer265923> Zero problem. Just use the USB cable and transfer the files, or go by bluetooth if you have the time. Both work flawless. Airdrop also works if you want to use an app and transfer over wlan. If you use the USB cable, you will get a lot of mac files on your Galaxy's SD card file system, like a file called ".DS_Store" in each folder. This doesn't hurt, but you might want to remove them or wonder where they came from.  <comment330241> Fantastic, will get straight on it. Appreciate the prompt advice!
