Prevent notifications from other apps when specific app is running <body> I have a GPS app (Waze) and when it runs, I don't want to recieve any notifications from Messages, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc.  Actually I don't want to recieve any notifications except phone calls. Is it possible to be in a "Driving mode" on my phone?   <answer293466> "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode will be available in iOS 11. So a few more months patience and you have the feature you want.      “It’s all about keeping your eyes on the road,” Apple Senior Vice   President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said when   introducing the feature at WWDC in June. “When you’re driving, you   don’t need to respond to these kind of messages. In fact, you don’t   need to see them"   Your iPhone will detect when it's in a driving car and put your phone on "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode. You can also manually turn it on/off via Control Centre.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVSVc.jpg" alt="Control Centre"  <comment370312> Great. Too bad it'll be lost in a sea of inscrutable little icons arranged haphazardly on the screen... <comment370327> For most part it will work automatically. When your iPhone detects it's in a moving vehicle it will turn on "Do Not Disturb While Driving" mode. <comment370348> What if I'm a passenger? I don't want to lose notifications when I'm not driving :/ <comment370439> You get an alert to verify if you are an passenger or not.
