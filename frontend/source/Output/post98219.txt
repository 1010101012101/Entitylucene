Ctrl key on Microsoft keyboard does not map to Mac's command <body> I am just settling in a new job and what I got on my hardware setup is a Mac with a Microsoft keyboard.  This support page indicates that the kbdControl/kbd key on my PC keyboard should be mapping to Mac's kbdCommand/kbd key but it does not (e.g. kbdCtrl/kbdkbdC/kbd/kbdV/kbd does not work).    How can I fix this?  <answer98220> The Control key on your PC keyboard maps to your Mac's Control key.  The Windows key on your PC keyboard maps to your Mac's Command key.  When using a PC keyboard you would use kbdwindows key/kbdkbdC/kbd to copy and kbdwindows key/kbdkbdV/kbd to paste, etc.  You can set universal keyboard shortcuts in strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Application Shortcuts  All Applications/strong, you can enter menu values (Save, Copy, Paste, etc) and then assign new key combinations to them.  In the example below I've set kbdcontrol/kbdkbdC/kbd to copy and kbdcontrol/kbdkbdU/kbd to paste.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VgpM2.png" alt="Example"  <answer98221> I think this is unclear text on the MS site. The text says     the keyboard shortcuts that you use map to different keys   which is not what you read and quoted it as. It means the keyboard short cut you type  in windows maps to a different keyboard shortcut in OSX.  What the text means that instead of typing kbdctrl/kbdkbdc/kbd on Windows you type kbdcmd/kbdkbdc/kbd on OSX  <answer129163> Use this software. https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/  It lets you remap keys on your Mac. I just used it on my Microsoft keyboard and it worked. It's better than just changing the shortcuts for copy/paste because almost every shortcut on the Mac uses those two keys.  Also, after I remapped my keys, I popped out the keys and put them in the similar Mac spots. Windows Key = Apple Key placement, Alt Key = Option Key placement.  I've added an image that shows my exact settings. Yours should be similar.  Now I just need to find a apple logo sticker to place over the windows logo ;-)  Enjoy.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDQZx.png" alt="Settings"  <answer230005> I run into same issue: At work I have to use Windows and at home I use a Mac. I'm sick of having different shortcuts for these basic tasks. Here is my solution for it:  Go to your User folder on your Mac and open the Library directory.  Here you create a "KeyBindings" folder.  Then navigate into that folder: (Your User folder)/Library/KeyBindings/  Create a file "DefaultKeyBinding.dict" with following lines:  precode"^v" = "paste:"; "^c" = "copy:"; "^x" = "cut:"; "^z" = "undo:"; /code/pre  Save everything and restart your Mac.  Now, you will have CTRL + x/c/v/z working like it is on a Windows machine.  BE AWARE: This will overwrite whatever Apple has configured for these shortcuts. For instance CTRL + v is a standard shortcut for page down, which will not work anymore.  <comment115325> can that be changed ? <comment115326> @amphibient It can, in "System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  All Applications" you can enter menu values (Save, Copy, Paste, etc) and then assign new key combinations to them. <comment151181> You actually don't need to get KeyRemap4Macbook. You can do it just as well in [System Preferences  Keyboard  Modifier Keys](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ATCiL.png).
