How to display more than 100 podast on the list? <body> Since I've downloaded iTunes 11, I noticed that when I click on list, its only display the last 100 podcasts download, they are still in my computer because when I click on podcast I can see the previous podcast, but I need the list display because I've put some note beside to know at what time the music is nice.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pLYN.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So, if anyone knows how to display more than 100 podcast on the list, please you welcome :)  Thanks  <comment94664> Which list are you referring to? Maybe just put a screenshot on a sharing site and add a link as a comment here, somebody with enough reputation will then edit it into the question. <comment94667> Hi, here is a screenshot : http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/987/itunese.jpg as you see, when i click on list, only the last 100 last podcast are displayed, i have podcast weekly since 2007 and with list i can not see them all, i need this feature cause as you see, i put some note (like time with nice music) thanks a lot <comment94835> no one knows? :(
