Will superdrive work on Macbook Air with Ubuntu? <body> I have a Macbook Air on which I am considering installing Ubuntu 14.  I bought the Mac mainly because of the great hardware.  I got a live copy of Ubuntu working from a USB stick and I am now just testing to see if everything works.  My Soulmate bluetooth device works fine.  My external Western Digital USB harddrive works fine.  My Apple Superdrive does not seem to work.  I figured this might be because I have not actually installed and added the third party support.    Anyone get their Superdrive working under Ubuntu on a Macbook Air?  <answer146030> Some tweaks needed.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
