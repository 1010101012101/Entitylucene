How can I make a playlist of podcasts I have started but not finished <body> Right now I have smart playlists that surface the podcasts I most want to listen to.  I sort them by release date, and generally all is good, but there are times when I start a podcast, am interrupted, and then download new podcasts, and lose track of the fact that I have a partially listened to podcast hanging out waiting for completion.  Is there a smart playlist filter similar to the play count (which counts completed plays) but that counts play "starts"?   Failing that, since itunes obviously knows where I left off... since it resumes play at the point I left off, is there a filter that can be set on the "time remaining" or something?  And failing that, is that "time remaining" / "time played until" available in applescript ... in which case I could write a script to hijack some other filterable feature.  (i.e. I never use the "skips" count, so I could write a script to set that to 1 for podcasts I've started without finishing, and 0 otherwise, and then make my playlist filter on that)
