Move defunct gmail ActiveSync calendar entries (iOS) to gmail cal <body> My father-in-law set up gmail ActiveSync on an old iPhone a long time ago and continues to add calendar dates to it even though it is defunct. He's upgraded iPhones to a 6s but still has that old account as his default.   strongQuestion/strong: How do I get those calendar entries off of a non-syncing account and move them to a regular google calendar account?  <answer242029> The best method I found was to purchase and use iExplorer. I backed up the phone and then exported as vCards and calendar files to the attached computer. Then I imported them into google calendar and contacts for them (they were moving to Android).
