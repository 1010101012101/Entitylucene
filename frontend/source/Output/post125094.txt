How does Font Book.app determine the "Design style" for a Smart Collection? <body> In Font Book.app one of the criteria for creating a Smart Collection is "Design style".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMccc.png" alt="Font Book.app Smart Collection dialog"  How does Font Book.app determine whether or not a given font falls into one of the available categories?  <answer125097> That kind of info is often included in the metadata of the font file itself, especially in OTF files. It is usually the type designer or foundry that categorizes the font in the first place.  <answer166359> OK, I think I figured it out...  Opening a font in RoboFont, I scoured all the obscure meta-info available and finally found the entry that seems to correspond to what FontBook uses for the emDesign Style/em in the section called Panose (a term I had never heard of!).  Long story short... FontBook seems to probably use the codeProportion/code to determine the style.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zoht0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment146392> Could you go into a bit more detail? I've read about some of the various OpenType tables but haven't grokked which tables would indicate that a font is monospaced for example. <comment194978> Such a good question!  There is DEFINITELY no meta info embedded in these fonts that "matches up" with these "styles".  It must be embedded in some undocumented "database" used by FontBook, or provided by some Apple "service".
