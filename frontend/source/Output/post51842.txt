Why is Growl showing redundant notifications for Keka? <body> Whenever I carry out an action in Keka, such as extraction or compression, I receive three Growl notifications. All are identical, but only one has the correct icon (Keka's icon) while the other two seem to display a missing icon.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZWJ2.png" alt="Example"  I've checked Growl and there's only one Keka entry.  I'm running Growl 1.3.3 and Keka 1.0.1 (not App Store version).  <answer51843> It would appear to be an issue with Keka not Growl, I've just updated Keka to 1.0.2 and the issue is resolved.     Changes in version 1.0.2 (10/04/2012)      ul   liFixed and issue with password protected rar files (Thanks to Clayman feedback) [Ticket 45]/li   liFixed double notification with Growl 1.3+ (Thanks to all the feedback to Chris and MacUpdate users!)
