MDM Multiple Domains <body> I have a Server running Mavericks, all works fine. My domain is server.myawesome.com, of which Im managing all my devices successfully using profile manager.  Is it possible to run a second Domain for another sister company on the same server? Say on server.mysexy.com? Would it run independently? I realise that the OD master would probably need to service both systems. But that would be easy to manage with groups.  Any ideas?
