MacBook Pro 13 with Retina display consumes 10% battery overnight with the lid closed, is this normal? <body> I bought a MacBook Pro 13 Retina nearly a month ago. Talking to a friend he told me that is not normal for this pc to consume 10% battery over night with the lid closed and with "Power Nap" disabled.  Is it true? And if it is in fact true, is this problem covered by the warranty?   This is the log what i get from the codepmset -g log | grep ' Wake '/code command  precode2016-09-22 23:05:30 +0300 Wake Requests         [*proc=mDNSResponder request=Maintenance inDelta=7198]

The logs are in line with developer notes for events available to make the computer wake up, and log that it is "slow", so far example, as OzzieSpin said in a comment above, your computer is waking up emabnormally/em--unless (as also several comments above discussed, it is trying to connect with something)--for example verify, strongbluetooth is off,/strong strongnothing is connect to the computer in any way/strong, including the strongSD card slot/strong,the computer was strongnot connected/strong to any type of server e.g. smb shared-drives or ldap, and there are no programs at all running (emyes/em, including Safari, or Drop Box, which emboth could cause exactly these symtoms/em), including those you don't expect (see for example your "start-up" items under emUsers &amp; Groups/em in System Preferences, and $USER/Library/LaunchAgents). Would you please post the output of codesudo ifconfig/code?  strongYou can verify this by looking at this nearly identical post on Apple's website/strong, where the OP comes back after receiving Apple support, and decides that the strongissue was an incompatible wireless access point or router/strong, and a firmware upgrade on the router solved the issue, apparently.  strongThat link as well as this one, contains long lists of things you need to check, directly from Apple,/strong and      I would be surprised if your issue doesn't go away after walking   through those posts alone.   Moving on a bit further, the usual action, if I had not seen those posts would be to reset your SMC (instructions by model, here), and PRAM. Plug in your laptop to the wall, close all applications/save your data, then hold down kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd and press the power button. The screen should turn off instantly. Then, wait 10 seconds. Next, while it is off, hold kbdCmd/kbd+kbdOpt/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd then press the power button. Keep holding those buttons until you hear the chime, the screen lights up, then turns off again.  After ensuring you'd turned off services (see the links above), and then reset the hardware, you could mostly eliminate the computer as the sole source of the issue.  As a side note here, since Sierra literally just came out, then depending on your situation, you might wait until the bugs are worked out a bit before upgrading.    <answer261766> I was suffering the same issue before, my MBP 2015's battery was draining slowly but when I don't use it so frequently, this caused so much pain. This method helped me so much, now I can go out with my mac with %20 charge and make my day. There is a significant difference between MacBook Pro 2015 and the previous models of MacBook Pros. You can check these settings by this command line;  precodeioreg -l | grep IOPlatformFeatureDefaults /code/pre  Output on your mac would be like this;  precode{"TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep"=Yes,"DNDWhileDisplaySleeps"=No,"TCPKeepAliveExpirationTimeout"=43200,"NotificationWake"=Yes} /code/pre  To make your MBP sleep deep like the old versions you should first restart your computer into recovery mode. To do that you should restart your mac and hold CMD+R until you hear the start up sound. After that open terminal and type this;  precodecsrutil disable /code/pre  Then restart your MacBook again. Go to this destination, you can access inside kext files by right click-Show Package Contents  precode/System/Library/Extensions/IOPlatformPluginFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/X86PlatformPlugin.kext/Contents/Resources /code/pre  Find your board id with:  precodeioreg -l | awk '/board-id/{print $4}' | sed 's/[&lt;"&gt;]//g' /code/pre  Open &#60;your_board_id&#62;.plist (e.g. Mac-E43C1C25D4880AD6.plist) file by a text editor and edit these settings just like these;  precode&lt;key&gt;TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; &lt;key&gt;NotificationWake&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; &lt;key&gt;DNDWhileDisplaySleeps&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  TCPKeepAliveDuringSleep keeps your MacBook connections open when its sleeping, so it keep Wifi connected. NotificationWake wakes your Mac randomly to check notifications especially make this one false. DNDWhileDisplaySleeps means "Do not disturb on sleep"; MacBook does get disturbed by notifications when its asleep.  My personal opinion is this process should be done by every 2015+ MacBook users. Because MacBooks are not cellphones that ring for notifications. Apple should have made a toggle button for this.  Do not forget to enable System Integrity Protection again. You should restart into recovery mode and on terminal type "csrutil enable" and restart.  strongUPDATE:/strong This reportedly no longer works with the latest versions of MacOS.

Type this into terminal:  codesudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 0/code  After you enter your password for sudo it gives you a warning saying some features may not work properly but it disables internet during sleep.  You can check it works by running:  codepmset -g/code  Which should show "codetcpkeepalive 0/code"  And you can of course reverse it at any time by running:  codesudo pmset -b tcpkeepalive 1/code  Simple!  Note: You can also force your Mac not to connect to the Internet when it's asleep even when connected to a power supply, if you like: codesudo pmset -a tcpkeepalive 0/code. Personally I don't mind as long as it's not using my battery, so code-b/code is fine for me.  <comment315828> Sitting overnight with the lid closed it should consume almost 0 battery.  Make sure you've reviewed your Power settings and see if anything is running overnight.  Also, check if you have anything connecting to the MBP that could be reaching-out to it at night and causing it to wake-up and respond. <comment316092> I did review my power settings, I also updated to sierra and but nothing changed. And because I updated to sierra now i cant do syslog for some reasons :/ <comment316193> Looks like your MBP is waking up to show some sort of notification, are there any notifications on the screen when you wake the machine up in the morning? <comment316199> Just the weather one i think, havent checked as i dont really use this feature! Do you think i should go in "do not disturb" mode? <comment316519> What's all those com_apple_driver_AppleUSBCardReaderDriverNub messages?  Is there something connected via USB? <comment316530> "Sitting overnight" is a pretty subjective term.  For me, that means 2am to 6am.  Can you be more specific?  How old is the MBP?  What model? From your logs, it's waking every 20 mins or so to check something over WiFi which requires power.  So far, things look somewhat "normal" <comment316533> Well, in this case overnigh is  from 23:00 to 8:00. And it's a Macbook Pro 13 retina and is just 1month old thats whats actually bothering me so much. It shouldnt loose so much bat at such a young age... <comment317395> I formated (deleted and reinstalled the os from apple servers) all together. But i still see the same logs, do you think i still should reset my SMC? <comment317424> @p3rand0r Why not? See if it works. <comment317574> resetting the smc is a not-normally-needed, but fairly routine maintainance task.  Do it, but also did you read the links I posted?  This, also you reinstalling OSX likely doesn't matter if you have an incompatible wi-fi access point or some other external issue, from something communicating (or trying to) with your computer. <comment317664> @forgotstackxpassword yes i did, even though is true i have a D-Link router  , i cannot upgrade its firmware as its already on the latest one. And I ordered a new one. But by the time ill have it i wanted to try something more just in case, hence the os reinstalling. Just to be sure its not hardware based, because in the link you gave me someone said they had the same problem and went to apple and they change it for a cpu sensor going bad, but all the others said it was software based thats why i was doubting is not the router, lets see if with the new one the problem persist <comment317677> cool, thanks for the update, glad it was a bit helpful so far <comment317719> @forgotstackxpassword no, thank you! sorry for the trouble but at the price a pc like this comes its not normal to have this kind of problems from 0 day, and the thing is that i dont know, in case apple fixes my pc if they give another pc to work with as i have a lot of work to do <comment317724> @fbara no nothing, all program closed and no usb or cables attached ... <comment317808> @forgotstackxpassword Tried with another router (CISCO) still the same problem... <comment317827> Have you considered installing 10.10? (unless you need software that runs only on 10.11 or "better", such as xcode) <comment317953> That is good you got a new router.  I added to the first paragraph of the answer a few more tips, plus summary of comments above.  If you could post ifconfig or any other logs of what the network is doing at those times it might be a last-minute save for you! cheers <comment317956> I did add to the answer below with more things you should confirm.  The comments here from others are right-on, it's obviously connecting to something, but also it could be broken, for example a search on google for "AppleUSBCardReaderDriverNub" yields completely nothing for me. <comment317957> I saw [this thread on Apple's site](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7010693?start=165&tstart=0) and it's similar to your issue.  There's about 15 pages of info, too much for me to review.  Maybe you'll find helpful info there? <comment319008> hi p3rand0r please keep us all updated how it is going <comment319569> @forgotstackxpassword sorry for the delay, i busy lately, so long story short i talked to an apple senior costumer support more on the updated post! <comment319590> Yes, thanks; running the programs "Drop Box" and Safari, would definitely cause Network traffic!  That's really valuable info; make sure Drop box is completely uninstalled, from `/Applications` or any where else, and that nothing Drop Box-related is in `$USER/LaunchAgents,` `$USER/LaunchDaemons,` `/Library/LaunchAgents,` or `/Library/LaunchDaemons,` or Start Up Items in your Users & Groups setting for your users.  Just post or search more if you need help to completely get rid of Drop Box. <comment328162> That sounds like a really innovative solution!  I am not going to check it out, but it looks like really nice info to share ,+1 <comment329124> That is indeed a solution, but the thing that is really bothering me is why some Macbooks Pro have this problem and why some don't. My friend has the exam same Macbook configuration with almost the same exact softwares (classmate) and yet he doesn't have this problem... <comment329497> I really don't know why but actually, this is not a problem. Some Macbooks are just configured to check notifications while asleep. I guess 2015 and later MacBooks have this configuration on default, I got 2005 13" mbp purchased in 2016 june from a UK Apple store. <comment329499> not 2005, 2015 :) <comment343849> Works on mbp 2016 tb. <comment351074> Works on mbp 13" 2015. <comment352408> Done that, the problem still persist ! <comment364352> This apparently stopped working with MacOS 10.12.4, but according to Apple just enabling Do Not Disturb should be enough to disable it checking for messages in sleep mode: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25743 No idea if it does or not, though. <comment364353> See here for information on how this stopped working with 10.12.4: https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-if-your-2015-or-2016-mbp-has-some-battery-drain-while-sleeping-here-is-the-fix.2026702/page-3#post-24519234 <comment364355> According to Apple this IS normal for all 2015+ MBPs: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25743
