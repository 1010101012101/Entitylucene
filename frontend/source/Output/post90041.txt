What is the benefit of using a PM200 cable to connect an EIZO monitor ta a macbook? <body> My girlfriend bought an EIZO CG223W screen and uses it for now with my apple DVI-MiniDisplay-connector, when i don't need it. She could buy her own connector, but as well could buy a PM200 cable. brNow I'm a bit confused by the info on internet regarding the benefits of the PM200 cable vs. Apples DVI-MiniDisplay-connector:  ol lithe speed and color-quality/colordepth of the PM seems to be faster, but in realworld: how much will you notice?/li lican you use the monitors' USB-ports only with a PM200 cable?/li lican you daisy-chain a 3rd monitor only when using PM200?/li /ol  (I have e-mailed Eizo already regarding this question, but didn't find an  answer yet.)  <answer90385> Eizo (Netherlands) kindly and answered by e-mail. In short: brstrongfor using this monitor with a macbook, there is no advantage using the PM200-cable compared to an Apple mini-display - DVI connector./strong  More in detail: (excuse me for poor english: I used google translate)  ol liThe PM200 is a cable DisplayPort cable. By using this cable you can use the EIZO CG223W-BK to give 10 bit per color (1025 tones per Red, Green or Blue). 10 Bit Color depth is as far as we know not possible on a Mac because the graphics cards do not support 10 Bit capability combined with Photoshop.   To make display 10 bit color depth you should use this configuration:  ul liUse OS or Windows 7 (older Windows OS)/li liUse DisplayPort/li liUse of good quality DisplayPort cable/li liGraphics card must support 10 bit/li liApplication (software) must support 10 bit/li liApplication requires graphics card with 10 bit support   The application and the graphics card must therefore communicate in a certain way and we only know this possibility when using windows in combination with Photoshop CS6./li /ul/li liNo, the PM200 cable can only be used as a signal cable (like the DVI cable). To use hard drives and printers via the monitor always be a USB cable required. To calibrate you have this USB connection is also required./li liNo, the monitor can not signal to another spot or third monitor. Serial looping will not go./li /ol
