iPhone upgrade without deleting data <body> I have a iPhone 4, which is IOS 4.3.3. Now i need to upgrade it to the latest OS version, WITHOUT deleting any data. I have not tried to update my phone contacts in the last few years fearing it would delete the data. Can someone help me out?  <answer91627> Upgrades aren't supposed to delete data, but you can't really test if your data is corrupt, so you need to perform and test your backup if you fear losing data.  You might want to test your backup on a new device (borrow one from a friend) before your upgrade yours to see how your exact data does on the current "latest" OS.  That way you can wait or correct things (sync elsewhere, back up to paper, fix the corruption, etcâ€¦) before you upgrade.  Again, you could just upgrade and cross your fingers, but it's more about your data than the upgrade causing millions of people to lose data. Only the people with problems in their specific device or settings/data have issues when upgrading and it's hard to know if you are going to experience pain until attempting the task.  <answer91629> Okay, let me walk you through it step-by-step. The first thing we'll need to do is sync. Then we will backup, and then put the new OS on.  h2Syncing/h2  ol liTake your iPhone and plug it into your computer (using the charging cable that came with it)(it should have a USB, and iPhone connector)/li liIf iTunes does not automatically pop-up on your computer screen within 1 minute of pluging in, click the icon for iTunes on your computer./li liIn iTunes, your iPhone should pop-up after a few minutes. strongMake sure that you are syncing all that you will want when the whole process is over.
