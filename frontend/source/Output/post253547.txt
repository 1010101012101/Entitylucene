Remember item order in Menu bar between reboots <body> macOS Sierra added ability to rearrange items in the Menu bar, however after rebooting computer they reset to their previous order.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/byH89.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm not using Bartender or any Menu bar controlling apps.  How can I make icon order permanent?  <comment316130> It may require updates for those apps to be compatible. <comment316142> I don't think it's possible without a 3rd-party solution.  They store the order of the icons and restore that order upon reboot. <comment318259> a link 3rd party app to do that would be a great answer to my question. <comment319184> This is most likely a macOS Sierra bug, see iStat Menu's known issues: https://bjango.com/help/istatmenus5/knownissues/ <comment323400> O boy you have like 500 items in the top bar :/ <comment342755> @romaninsh Why not use Bartender then?
