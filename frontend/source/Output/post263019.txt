Is there a side effect when software update kills and relaunches Dock <body> We are working on a software update and need to relaunch Dock. We wanted to know if there is a side effect of this operation?  What I could see is that if someone is working on multiple apps and windows minimised, all will be focussed again on restart.  My main concern is: strongWill there be any loss of data for the user for example if software is updating in the background without user knowing it and an update restarts Dock?/strong
