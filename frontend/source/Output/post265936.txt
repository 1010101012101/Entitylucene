Spark showing Pins I don't want <body> I am using Spark email client on OS X. It retrieves my email from Gmail. Some emails are pinned when they arrive to the inbox. With some emails, when I reply, the reply is pinned and appears in my inbox.   I do not want any emails to be pinned unless I specifically press the pin icon in the mail, which I rarely do. How can I stop the auto-pinning?  <comment333455> I believe the pinning is taking place in gmail, not Spark. Spark simply displays a message differently if it has been pinned. The manual pinning I understand and it is up to me. Gmail pinning has something to do with Gmail's inspection of the mail and determine if something is important. If it is, then it pins it. I could be wrong, but that is what I think is happening. The question is how to stop the auto-pinning.
