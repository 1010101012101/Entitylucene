Why can't I update from Mountain Lion DP4? <body> My MacBook somehow stuck on Mountain Lion Developer Preview 4 (Build 12A256). I downloaded the Golden Master as well as the retail .dmg and tried to install them. The computer does stuff, restarts, but is still on 12A256. I also don't get the 10.8.1 Update in the App Store and if I download it manually and try to install it all I get is:     OS X update cannot be installed on this disk. This volume does not meet the requirements for this update   Do you have any idea how I get out of this mess without a clean install (because that's kind of tricky because I have 2 hard drives)?  <answer63202> After resetting my PRAM using kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd at boot I could install the update using a bootable USB drive.  <answer63535> Try running disk utility on your hard drive first then try the update.  Take a look at this link, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1782  <comment72872> That’s odd. I installed retail over DP 4, and it works flawlessly. The only difference was that I installed from a USB drive, rather than the traditional app based method. <comment72977> Thanks, using an USB-Stick I got some interesting log files and after some googling I found out I had to reset my PRAM. <comment72980> Will you accept that as an answer? <comment73480> As I wrote resetting my PRAM worked for me :) <comment73520> You know, on unknown reason reseting PRAM does not work for me... <comment77121> While the link you posted may answer the question, [it is best](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to summarize the contents of the link in your answer, then provide the link for reference.
