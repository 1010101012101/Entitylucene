Help! Lost admin password for Mac OS X server 10.9 <body> While our netwrokd administrator was admitted to a hospital for an emergency surgery (he is now in coma), being as a temporary delegate, I was ordered by our Institution to turn OFF Mail funciton and to change the admin account password for Mac OS X Server 10.9.2 for security reasons. While changing the password, I took a memo for the new password, but later it turned out to be wrong! My stupidity.  After restart, I cannot open codeServer.app/code that controls Mail service because it requires the unknown new password.  Currently Mail service is OFF (it had been turned OFF for security reason before password change), but I' going to need to turn it ON soon after the order is lifted. To do that, however, I need the new password. Luckily, the server still provides access to the Internet. Thus I can still ask you.  Thanks to the following instruction, I find a way to reset the admin password. http://fixedbyvonnie.com/2013/09/how-to-reset-the-admin-password-on-your-mac-without-a-disk/#.Uz5eM8cT-pe  I carried out a test of the same procedure on another Mac (10.9.2). In the test, although coderesetpassword/code command in codeRecovery Mode/code successfully updated the account password, it didn't update codedefault Keychain password/code at the same time.   After restart, the OS asks if I want to update 'default Kecyhain password'. To update it, I need to enter the older Keychain password that I don't know. If I skip the update, Keychain asks passwords repeatedly, and without the old Keychain password, I can't launch and open codeKeychain Access/code.  Then I found this. It says you can reset the Keychain password by codeKeychain First Aid/code. https://discussions.apple.com/message/24171670#24171670  However, in my test, codeKeychain First Aid/code still asks the older Keychain password, so this doesn't work.  In short, I can update the admin password, but not the Keychain password without knowing the old password. So if I carry out this on the server machine, The Server won't run properly and would ask passwords over and over again.  On the test Mac I tried to activate coderoot/code user, hoping the root user could change Keychain password without knowing the old Keychain password. But I couldn't access to the "login" Keychain of the account in question from the root account.  Does anyone know a work-around?  Is there a way to reset the codedefault Keychain password/code without the old Keychain password?  Or, is there a way to know the old Keychain password? Probably not.  Or, do you think codeTimeMachine/code can undo my failure in changing the admin password and recover the old admin password?  During this mail shutdown period, I assume many people have asked his health status by email. It's an emergency and I really need your help!  <answer126620> In conclusion, TimeMachine recovery of the entire system to the status before changing admin password worked well. I recovered the old admin password and it worked for Keychain Access as well.  In details; Just in case the recovery doesn't work and I lose the TimeMachine backups somehow, I copied the TimeMachine backup to another external drive. To do that, however, I needed admin password. So, first I had to reset the admin password.  Note: In my case, the destination for TimeMachine backup was a local partition (probably), so I didn't need network password to access it. strongIf it were in network, for example, you would need password that has been lost at step 8./strong Then this procedure may not work for you. Before actually try the following steps, it may be good to see if you need password for system recovery, following http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14185 (step 5 in this page is the key), but just cancel when you are asked to choose date and time.  ol liOpen the codeTime Machine/code pane in codeSystem Preferences/code.

Select the login keychain from the left side and then go to the codeFile/code menu and choose codeDelete Keychain “login”/code. When prompted, choose codeDelete References/code to allow the keychain file to stay on your hard drive for future re-activation.  <comment148135> I'll go for a Time Machine restore <comment148158> Thanks. I'm now looking up TimeMachine instructions. <comment148192> Your keychain is encrypted: you can’t decrypt it without the right password. Your best chance is indeed to recover a former version of your keychain, to which you know the password. Best wishes to your colleague. <comment148275> Cheers, that seems it. I'll try System recovery with TimeMachine.
