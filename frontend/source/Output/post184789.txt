Need Reminder Application to notify every X minutes during the day <body> Can one advise an application that can notify me each 1 hr 30 minutes during the day (let's say I can specify it to be from 10 AM till 11 PM). I've tried Alarmed, Beep me, AidaReminder but all of them can not handle this simple task with almost no effort of the user.  The point is: if I want to arrange my everyday life and get used to:  ul liTake pills at certain time/li liSmoke just 1 time in 2.5 hr/li liHave meals at a certain time/li liTake work breaks once in every 45 minutes that are lasting for 10 minutes/li liPlan to go to a gym every 3 days/li liGo to swimming pool every 2 days/li liPay rent every 15th day of every month/li lietc./li /ul  I know most there is a calendar and simple alarm for most of those tasks, for productivity at work there is pomodoro technique, for tasks like repeating an event (let's say allowing me to smoke once in 2.5 hr) I still have not found a good solution.  I want everything to be in one place. I need an app that I can say:  ul liRepeat event every 2 hours 25 minutes from 10 AM to 4 PM/li liRemind me to pay rent every 15th day at 10 AM/li liAfter every 45 minutes ask me to take an action and go to a 10 minutes break, notify when break is over and ask me to take action to get back to the work or postpone/li /ul  Is there any good app that meet those exact problems?  emstrongDisclaimer/strong/em: I've read the tour and I've found this question might be considered as falling into category of codeQuestions that are primarily opinion-based/code, but I want to point this out: I've listed emexact/em application responsibilities, so that's it: the application is meet the requirement or not, no place for subjectivity.  <answer184798> Take a look at Due. It has a Mac version as well, and I've not seen a more powerful timer app.  <answer275802> Your reminders to Go the the Gym, Pay Rent, Go Swimming, Take Pills and Have Meals can all be done easily using the Calendar while creating a daily or monthly reminder.   You can set an alert to take a break but you need to set the exact time and then when the break should end, e.g. you can set a smoke break for 10am and that break will end at 10:18am; something like that and you can repeat the break every day. However, there isn't a way to repeat the break every 2 hours, etc. You will need to manually enter the start time of the break and then request a daily repeat of the same break using the same time.   Personally, I need a way to set an alert that begins when I start it and lasts for 5 minutes and then repeats every 5 minutes until I stop it manually, but I haven't found anything that can do this.  <comment219158> Why exactly is setting up calendar entries not an option for you? <comment219343> Calendar app can not take care of repetitive tasks with arbitrary repetition time. Task: I want an even to beep every 15 seconds during the day. How this is done in Calendar app? <comment219345> This seems to be the closest to what I want. It also comes with this named timer notion. Like it so far.
