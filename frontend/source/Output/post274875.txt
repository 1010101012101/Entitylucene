Macbook pro crashes Whenever installing Matlab 2016? <body> Okay so, I have a emMacbook Pro mid-2012 macOS Sierra 8GB of RAM, 256GB SSD/em. I need Matlab for my work. And whenever I put Matlab on installation it does install up to strongem60%/em/strong but in it sixties somewhere the Mac crashes. Showing me a gray background saying "You are seeing this screen because of a problem with your mac...". I cannot understand where is the problem.   There is another problem. That is, my mac wont will work properly if I used it as long as I want then turn it off and wait for an hour or so to start it again. If I start it up right-away it would show a prohibition symbol on bootup and in verbose mode would say strongem"Read Error--Kernel Cache Read error"/em/strong  <answer274908> You never mentioned which version of MATLAB you were running.  However, the 9.0 (R2016a) doesn't mention Sierra at all and the R2016b which does list Sierra support has it as "limited."    First thing I would do is verify that your version of MATLAB is compatible with Sierra.  Secondly, a read error is indicative of a drive error.  It could be a corruption of the file or it could be a physical error.  You need to at least run First Aid on your drive to see if there are any problems.  <comment345899> Yes thanks, i did run first aid on the only drive that i have and it says, **problems were found with partition map that might prevent booting**.. Can you tell me what to do next? <comment345906> That would be a new question because on this site, it's one topic per question.  However, a [quick search](http://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=problems+found+partition+prevent+booting)  lists a number of similar problems and solutions.  If one of those questions/answers don't solve your issue, go ahead and open up a new question.
