How to change the default domain suffix for iPad Pro on screen keyboard? <body> As title, how can I change the default domain suffix to code.com/code for my iPad Pro on screen keyboard (Safari browser) as shown below? Because I use the suffix code.com/code more than other domain suffix. Every time I type the URL, I required to hold the code.co.uk/code key in order to get code.com/code which is quite inconvenient. I try google search but I didn't get any related result. Any solution? Sorry for my bad English.

It can't be changed independently of this. The .com TLD is used on the US keyboard. To change to a US keyboard, go to Settings → Keyboards → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard → English, then use the globe button to switch keyboards.
