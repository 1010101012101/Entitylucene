How to send two keystrokes that repeat in AppleScript? <body> I have something like  precodetell application "System Events"  set x to "x"  delay 1  repeat  delay 3  keystroke x  end repeat  set y to "y"  delay 1  repeat  delay 5  keystroke y  end repeat  end tell /code/pre  but it never keystrokes y, it only keystrokes x, and when I reverse it it waits 5 second to do y first, but I just want x to repeat every 3 seconds and y every 5 seconds.  <answer291278> You didn't specify how many times the loop will run. You can try something like this:  precodetell application "System Events"     set x to "x"     repeat 3 times         keystroke x         delay 3     end repeat     set y to "y"     repeat 5 times         keystroke y         delay 5     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <answer291282> I figured it out, you have to add the keystrokes to the same repeat  so  precoderepeat  keystroke "x"  delay 3  keystroke "y"  delay 5  end repeat /code/pre  <comment367753> But I want to go them consecutively, like it does x every 3 seconds, then y every 5 seconds, then it repeats again. <comment367754> Ok never mind I figured it out, you have to add the keystrokes in the same repeat. I'm so stupid ahaha
