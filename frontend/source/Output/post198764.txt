Change refresh rate/resolution on Seiki 4k using Mac Pro via HDMI? <body> I have a late 2014 (current model) Mac Pro and I use a Seiki 50 inch 4k TV to for that computer (the seiki does 30hz at 4k and should do 120 at 1080p). I use the HDMI port on the Mac Pro to directly connect to HDMI on the TV. I have seen others with this model on the internet where their settings menu has the option of refresh rate (mine picture below), I do not have this option or others they had like brightness.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILiS5.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to fix this (for example I believe the other person was using the display port instead of the HDMI, would that make a difference?), thank you.  Here is the link to the other person with the refresh rate option available (just scroll down a little and you will see it).
