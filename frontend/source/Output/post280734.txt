How can I copy application settings from one user account to the other on the same machine? <body> I have two user accounts (a work and personal account) on my MacBook Pro 5,3 with OS X 10.11.6. On both I use the same Logitech MX Master mouse in combination with the Logitech Options application. I would like to keep the settings (scroll speed, pointer speed, etc...) in sync such that I do not have to do the setup on each account.  How can I copy settings stored by an application (Logitech Options in this case) on one account to the other?  h3Attempts/h3  I have looked in code~/Library/Application Support/Logitech/Options/code. There I find 4 code.xml/code files. However, changing a setting in Logitech Options does not change the Date Modified of these files. Hence I think these files do not store the settings.  I have also run codelsof | grep -i logitech/code when Logitech Options is open. Unfortunately I only find files in my user directory related to the saved state of the application (code~Library/Saved Application State/com.logitech.Logi-Options.savedState//code). My understanding is that these relate to the window state of the application, not to the settings stored by it.  <answer280738> Most, but not all, applications save some settings in a code.plist/code file in code~/Library/Preferences/code.  Look for and appropriately named file containing the name of the application in question.  Copy this file to the same location under a different User's Home folder.  Note that you may have to adjust permissions on the file for the other User Account to read/write to the file.  <comment353118> Have you looked for an appropriate `.plist` file in `~/Library/Preferences` that might belong to Logitech? <comment353120> I did not. But that seems to be the answer. I found a file `com.logitech.manager.setting.0006b017.plist` which changed its modification date after I changed the settings. Make it an answer so I can accept it :)
