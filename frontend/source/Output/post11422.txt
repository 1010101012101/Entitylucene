Can I remap UP and DOWN arrow keys in Aperture? <body> I want to remap the up and down arrow keys, from strongMove Selection Up/strong and strongMove Selection Down/strong to strongIncrease Rating/strong and strongDecrease Rating/strong.  That way, it would be really instant to move between photos with the left/right arrows, and adjust the rating with the up/down arrows.  Unfortunately, the strongCommands/strong window does not let you edit these specific actions.  Does anyone knows if there is any workaround on this?  <answer11771> Did you try to assign them via the System Preferences? Go to the Keyboard Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard panel, and select Application Shortcuts. You can then add your own shortcuts. You can add any Menu text and assign it a shortcut. Beware to spell out the menu text exactly as it appears in the actual menu.  <answer11843> So, using a little plist trickery, I've managed to re-assign those keys.  The steps I took are the following:  ul liAperture  Commands..  Customize/li liDuplicate current command set and name it "MySet"/li liExport &amp; delete the current set/li liOpen it with Property List Editor/li liFind and Delete: MoveSelectionUp and MoveSelectionDown entries/li liSave and exit/li liImport it via Aperture  Commands..  Import/li liSelect it via Aperture  Commands..  Custom commands set/li /ul  So now the UP &amp; DOWN arrow keys are free to assign whatever you like (in my case Increase &amp; Decrease rating feels like the way to go!)  <comment12312> Unfortunately, it seems that Aperture override those settings :(
