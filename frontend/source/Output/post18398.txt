You use the Music and the Video app that come pre-installed on your device and connect to your home-shared iTunes library. It's as easy as that.  If you then download bazillions of other Apps that have similar icons and do similar things it's not really Apple's fault, is it? <comment92369> You can enable WiFi-synchronization and then the iPad will synchronize over WiFi when it is on the same network as iTunes and attached to power. <comment92370> Could you flesh this out with some more detail?
