Multiple applications using a serial port to mirror data <body> I am trying to achieve something similar to Creating a virtual serial port, for the exact same reason. I have NMEA data coming in over a TCP connection from my an app on my iPhone. I want to feed that NMEA into google earth. However, no matter how I try to create a "virtual" serial port, nothing works (google earth doesn't recognize it as a real serial port).  So I, much like the conclusion in the article I linked, gave up. But now I have purchased an Adafruit FTDI friend for a completely different project. But I realized "Hey, can't you create a loopback serial by just connecting TX and RX together?" Well, yes, you can. And yes, google earth sees the FTDI friend.  So my question is basically, is there a way to have one application pull the data from that TCP connection coming from my phone, and have it spit it out the FTDI Friend, then have google earth listening to the FTDI Friend as well, pulling out the NMEA data?  So far I have been fetching the NMEA data by just doing codecurl http://ip-of-my-iphone:11000//code. I've tried codecurl http://ip-of-my-iphone:11000/ &gt; /dev/tty.usbserial-(serial # of FTDI friend)/code, and a variant of the same command using codecu.usbserial/code instead of codetty.usbserial/code, then in both cases, setting google earth to scan for NMEA data, but it doesn't pick anything up. If it matters, google earth only seems to be looking on the codecu/code devices. I feel like I am either missing a step here, or doing something wrong.
