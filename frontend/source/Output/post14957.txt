Can you run Samba on Snow Leopard workstations? <body> it appears that Samba functionality is restricted to the server edition of OS X 10.6 - is there a workaround or third-party solution?  <answer14958> File sharing is available on the client under System PreferencesSharingFile Sharing.   You can then select what to share. Once you've done that click the options button. And select the third option shown in the image below.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lASFW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment16123> ie samba is part of standard Snow Leopard not just the server. <comment20864> Would I be right in thinking this functionality to configure SMB shares is new to SL? I certainly haven't bothered to look behind the File Sharing option since the days of Tiger. Many thanks for posting :-) <comment21634> It's been around since tiger, but leopard/sl gave you better sharing options.
