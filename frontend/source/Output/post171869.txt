Use smart folder as Finders default folder <body> Does anybody know how to setup a smart folder as Finders default folder?  If I try to select the smart folder in Finder settings, the "choose" button is deactivated like the screenshot shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ss9qB.png" alt="Finder settings"  <answer171870> Finder preferences doesn't allow this. You need to set the preference yourself:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder NewWindowTargetPath -string "file:///Users/path" /code/pre  supRequires log out and log in./sup  <comment202274> Unfortunately not working for me, i tried `defaults write com.apple.finder NewWindowTargetPath -string "/Users/"` and a new Finder windows defaults to `/Users/paul` (I restarte the Finder app)  Another question: Since the smart folder ist just a ".savedSearch" file, do I have to point "NewWindowTargetPath" directly to the file? <comment282504> I can confirm this does not work <comment282550> @mliqu Apologies, I missed the `file://` prefix, can you try again? <comment282551> @bassgang Yes, you should be able to point this at a ‘.savedSearch’. I missed the `file://` prefix — see the edit. <comment282553> @grgarside thanks for replying, still not working for me, here is what i am doing: `defaults write com.apple.finder NewWindowTargetPath -string "file://Users/mliqu/Library/Saved Searches/Recent Folders.savedSearch"` <comment282555> @mliqu I tried this including the file prefix and it works fine for me, 10.11.4b7. I'm not sure what else to suggest, apologies again. <comment282556> @grgarside oh, well, i'm on 10.11.3, hope that is the issue... thanks for trying!
