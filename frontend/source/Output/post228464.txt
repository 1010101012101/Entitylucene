What are the color and transparency of the OS X menubar <body> I want to have an application I'm writing mirror the color and transparency set for the OS X menubar, but there doesn't seem to be any way to find the exact values besides trial and error.  Does anyone have a complete listing, for all four possible combinations of enabled/disabled dark mode and transparency?  Edit: I'm trying to find the rgba values of the menu bar background color for each of the four possible combinations  <answer228487> You can use code/Applications/Utilities/Digital\ Color\ Meter.app/code to get the RGB value of any pixel shown on your monitor.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0XyTm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment278612> That does not help me find the color of the menu bar background because of its transparency. <comment278614> Don't the RGB values in transparency mode depend on the desktop background/picture you are using? <comment278624> Yes, but I want my application to work regardless of the desktop background picture set. <comment278626> How can you know this beforehand then? <comment278630> It's why I'm asking for the ARGB value of the menubar background (depending on transparency/dark mode settings) - so I can have my application result in the same color when over the same desktop background picture. <comment278638> It's more if an effect depends on what's in the background. What are you gonna use it for? Possible answer http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/20711/how-to-re-create-this-ios7-blur-effect
