Permanently remove icons from Dock <body> I have Maps, Photos and iBooks icons returning to my dock after a reboot even though I removed them several times already. Is there some way to remove them? They seem to be set as defaults, can I change these defaults somehow?  <answer227276> The property list is most likely corrupted. The following emwill reset the dock to it’s default/em, but it should subsequently allow you to modify it and have it work properly.  ul liOpen Finder. Hold down kbdshift/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd+kbdG/kbd to open a “Go To Folder” window./li liEnter the following path: code~/Library/Preferences/code  ul liWithin the folder, move any file starting with the string codecom.apple.dock/code to your Trash. /li liNavigate to code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/code as well. Remove any file starting with codecom.apple.dock/code in the same manner./li /ul/li liLog out of your account and log back in. The dock should be reset to default./li liNow, attempt to modify it:  ul liRemove the unwanted dock icon(s)/li liReboot, log back in to make sure the modifications are preserved./li /ul/li /ul  hr  Note that I'm assuming you are running 10.10 or higher.  <answer261933> This answers it partially. When I encountered the same problem on El Capitan, these steps solved it.  ol liDisable System Integrity Protection./li licodesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "delete:add-app" /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.dockfixup.plist sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "delete:add-doc" /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/com.apple.dockfixup.plist /code/li liRe-enable System Integrity Protection./li /ol  I referred to another discussion for PlistBuddy  <comment276035> What version of OS X are you running? <comment276038> I am running 10.11.3 <comment276041> The dock reset its position from left side to bottom after I deleted the files, but the dock icons still return after the reboot. Is it possible I have some device policy that is enforcing them (this is a work macbook). <comment276079> @gruszczy Possible, but unlikely. Are you an admin. on the machine? I suggest logging in another user account and seeing if the behavior persists (Guest should suffice) in order to try and at least isolate the issue. <comment276088> In an earlier version, I had to make Dock changes that could not be done by GUI.  I had to change the plist, but since Dock on exit write the plist with its current state, I had to kill -9 as soon as I had made the changes. <comment276089> njboot: I can't seem to be able to log in as a guest. There isn't any option anywhere. But I discovered that I don't need to reboot, it's enough to log out + log in for the icons to appear again. <comment276090> WGroleau: Could you walk me through the process of what you did? <comment277541> @gruszczy if your account has admin. privileges, then you can create a new account to test the behavior (System Preferences  User Accounts). If you aren’t, I suggest having whomever is (the IT dept at your work) troubleshoot the issue. <comment341109> Thanks! This was exactly what I was looking for. At first I didnt get it to work, but that was because I'd forgotten sudo (PlistBuddy fails silently if you do...) <comment372041> Thanks for the detailed instructions. This finally worked, after I had tried several other approaches.
