Why can't I add more options to the search in Finder? <body> I used to be able to click on the + next to save. After I upgraded to Yosemite, the + now became a - and I can't add exact match anymore. Any idea?  Thanks  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N6WXC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer200327> Start your Search from anywhere else except "All My Files"  I don't know why, but that has no +br possibly because it's already a smart list, under the skin  <answer209619> This is a bit late, but it's because you are searching from the "all my files" view. Try clicking another folder and then initiating a search.
