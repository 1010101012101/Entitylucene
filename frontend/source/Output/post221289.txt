Can a faulty HDMI cable damage macbook <body> I tried to connect my rMBP mid-2014 to a TV through an HDMI cable. I first plugged the cable to the TV. when plugging the other end of the cable to the HDMI port on the macbook, I heard some crackling noise (as if it did not fit well). Then, I saw that the TV was listed on displays but I never managed to get the secondary desktop displayed on the TV. Then, I unplugged the cable and saw that some pins in the end of the cable that I plugged to the macbook were crooked. Might I have possibly damaged my computer?  note: diagnostics did not find any issues.  <comment267934> You are going to get a yes answer and a no answer. Why not take a picture of the Mac port and/or the cable to show the bent pins. Also, in the end our opinions don't matter as much as you testing the Mac with a different/good cable to know if it's working or not. <comment267939> what you are saying makes a lot of sense. thanks!
