The Insert key without 3rd party apps on MacBook Air in VirtualBox running Linux <body> h2Hardware setup/h2  I use MacBook Air with what seems to be an English international keyboard layout. My Input Sources are set to emPolish - Pro/em in the Keyboard settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W0lBw.png" alt="English international keyboard layout MacBook Air"  h2Software setup/h2  I run Debian 8.6.0 in a VirtualBox with a dwm window manager and xterm as the default terminal app there. The way copy and pasting works there is to select the text and press either emInsert/em or the middle mouse bottom to paste the selection elsewhere.  My problem is that I cannot find a way to simulate pressing either of them. Is there a way to do it on MacBook Air with any 3rd party apps to remap my keyboard? I'm just looking for a way to copy and paste text in Debian Linux running inside the VirtualBox.  Here's what I've tried so far:  h3Insert key:/h3  ul likbdfn/kbdkbdEnter/kbd/li likbdfn/kbdkbdEnter/kbd, kbdfn/kbdkbdEnter/kbd/li likbdfn/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdEnter/kbd/li likbdControl/kbdkbdfn/kbdkbdm/kbd/li likbdfn/kbdkbdm/kbd (emprints codem/code obviously/em)/li likbdControl/kbdkbdfn/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdm/kbd/li likbdControl/kbdkbdfn/kbdkbd&#x232B;/kbd (emprints code5~/code/em)/li likbdControl/kbdkbdfn/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd&#x232B;/kbd (emprints code6~/code/em)/li likbdfn/kbdkbdi/kbd (emprints codei/code obviously/em)/li /ul  Neither of which work.  h3Middle mouse button:/h3  ul liPress the touchpad with two fingers simultaneously./li liPress the touchpad with two fingers simultaneously holding kbdShift/kbd./li /ul  Neither of which work.  h3References:/h3  ul liWhere is the insert key on a MacBook Air?/li liHow do I simulate the Insert key in Windows on a MacBook Pro?/li liInsert key on keyboard for Macbook Air Mountain Lion OS/li /ul  <answer262770> emIt is not what I am looking for but it is a fine solution for the time being.

I decided to remap codekeycode 104/code to Insert with codexmodmap -e "keycode 104 = Insert"/code.  As a result I am able to paste with kbdfn/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbdRight Alt/kbdkbdEnter/kbd.  h3References/h3  ul liMissing Apple MacBook Keys: How to map the INSERT key in Linux/VirtualBox/li lixmodmap on ArchWiki/li liRemap the insert key/li /ul
