Why might cellular data usage be attributed to Siri even when Siri is disabled? <body> I always have Siri turned off. Yet, looking at the usage data reported under em/Settings/Cellular/SystemServices/em I observed the following:  strongJuly/strongbr Siri = 3.5-MBbr Hotspot = 1,300-MB  strongAugust/strong (as of the 25th)br Siri = 1-MBbr HotSpot = 25-MB  ol liIs there an (easy to understand) reason why in one month, at least 1-MB of data usage is logged under Siri when Siri is turned off?/li liAs observed in my data, surely there is a causation between HotSpot usage and an increase in data usage attributed to Siri even when Siri is turned off?/li /ol  Of course, this is not a big deal. Just curious.  <comment374342> Do you use Siri App Suggestions? This could be the culprit. <comment374367> No. In July I never visited the App Store. While tethering, I watched every MB used and then observed Siri was unfairly being assigned cellular usage. But, it doesn't matter. thanks! <comment374440> It isnâ€™t the App Store that uses Siri, it is your device. Take a look at [this screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/oVjBH)
