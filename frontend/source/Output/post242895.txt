Forcing an app to clean itself? <body> I've been swiping around the home screen on my iPhone when I see the text under the Facebook logo switch to codecleaning.../code, but it's nothing that I made it do, is there any way to tell an app to clean itself?  <answer242897> I found this OS X Daily article that should answer your question.  Basically, when storage is low, iOS detects apps that take up a lot of space with old caches and temporary files and automatically delete them. It's perfectly normal. The user can't force iOS to clean apps, though.  <comment298917> "Cleaning..."? I've never heard of apps being cleaned. Is your iPhone Jailbroken? <comment298918> Nope.  It's not jail broken.  Maybe only Facebook does it. <comment298919> Do you have anything installed under Settings  General  Profiles & Device Management? <comment298920> Just an certificate. <comment298921> And you intentionally installed it and know what it's for, right? <comment298922> That's correct. I knowingly installed it. <comment298923> Can you post a screenshot of the home screen? <comment298925> No I can't, it happens very quickly. <comment298926> But there isn't a way to force it?  Thanks Apple! <comment298927> @leeand00 You should suggest it to Apple. <comment298928> How do you do that?  And something tells me it would be against their business model. <comment298931> @leeand00 It kind of is, but it wouldn't hurt to suggest it at http://www.apple.com/feedback/ if it's a feature you really want.
