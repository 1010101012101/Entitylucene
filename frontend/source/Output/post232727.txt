Make Sidebar items in Finder larger without affecting any other application <body> h3Background/h3  I'd like to make items in the Finder's Sidebar larger like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5D0B1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Theoretically, you can do it like this:  ol liOpen emSystem Preferences/em./li liOpen emGeneral/em./li liSet emSidebar icon size:/em to emMedium/em or emLarge/em./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nN3lE.png" alt="enter image description here"  h3Problem/h3  Unfortunately, it affects not only the Sidebar in Finder but also in iTunes and so on.  Is it possible to make Sidebar items larger for Finder exclusively?  <comment284568> I don't believe so, or at least not built in to OS X. <comment284580> @Appelflapper. I thought so. Maybe someone will come up with a nice software solution for that.
