Is using a key shortcut for restart (Cmd + Ctrl + Power) bad in any way? <body> I restart my Mac (for various reasons) often, about once a day. Recently I found about the key shortcut to do this: codeCmd/code + codeCtrl/code + codePower/code. I really like this because it's fast and avoids that annoying prompt about "reopening windows when coming back".  My question: is using key shortcut codeCmd/code + codeCtrl/code + codePower/code forceful, aggressive or potentially damaging in any way (like losing recent data)? Or, it is the same thing as doing it by clicking the menu options ( - Restart... - Restart).  <answer173746> kbdCommand/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbdPower button/kbd will force a restart without any intervention from the system. Applications will not be closed in a proper way and everything that is not yet written to disk will be lost.  strongIt is definitely not safe./strong  You could use kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdControl/kbd + kbdPower button/kbd to shutdown and then kbdPower button/kbd to start.     Quit all apps (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then shut down the computer   <answer173750> If you want to be able to Restart strongwithout/strong the dialog, by key-command…br an alternative, which is not truly intuitive, is to set up a key combo frombr System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts.  For example, you add Restart… as a combobr …which irritatingly then puts another Restart into the  menu (it also does the same for Shutdown.)  So, the fix is then to add a second shortcut for Restart itself - which must be different to the first one, of course.

I'm guessing typo. <comment204432> @Tetsujin Not really the other one also have option in the combination <comment204433> A combo for a safe restart already exists: Command-Option-Control-Power button (Quit all apps (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then shut down the computer) <comment204434> Confused me - it specifically says both… Command-Control-power button Force the Mac to restart  Command-Control-Power button Quit all apps (after giving you a chance to save changes to open documents), then restart the computer <comment204436> That's shutdown, not restart, though. I don't have a power button on my keyboard, so I've always had my own combos set up anyway.
