Localhost Forbidden <body> I've read many posts and articles on how to fix this but I'm at a loss as to why nothing I try is working!  I have a number of vhosts setup in my document root which are working fine but for some reason I can't get access to localhost itself, permissions look ok to me i.e. _www has full access to document root and all subfolders  Below is an excerpt from my https.conf:  precodeDocumentRoot "/Users/cduve/sites"  &lt;Directory /&gt;     Options FollowSymLinks     AllowOverride None     Order deny,allow     Deny from all &lt;/Directory&gt;  &lt;Directory "/Users/cduve/sites"&gt;     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all &lt;/Directory&gt; /code/pre  And a screenshot of the finder info for "/Users/cduve/sites":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FGFCE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer110736> I managed to solve this by checking the error_log file using the codetail -f/code command which included the following error:  precode[client 127.0.0.1] mod_hfs_apple: Mis-cased URI or unacceptable Unicode in URI: /users/cduve/sites/, wants: /Users/cduve/Sites/ /code/pre  The above error made me fix the case of the document root, the next error encountered was:internal server error so going back to the error_log:  precode[crit] [client ::1] configuration error: couldn't perform authentication. AuthType not set!: /  /code/pre  Which was solved by commenting out codeRequire all granted/code in https.conf  The original set up was on a MBP using the following steps.  The virtual host set up was done as per: http://www.coolestguidesontheplanet.com/downtown/how-set-virtual-hosts-apache-mac-osx-109-mavericks-and-osx-108-mountain-lion  <comment129894> What is the permission on the parent folder `/Users/cduve/` ?? <comment129895> Oh -- and, you probably need "Sites" instead of "sites" in the apache config files.  If that works, let me know, and I'll put it in the answer section below. <comment129896> @Kent Tried 'Sites' but no joy, funny thing is the  vhosts are subdirectories of sites and they work fine but if I try to access them with localhost/vhost1 etc. it's forbidden... Permissions for cduve are rw for cduve r for staff and no access everyone <comment129906> In order to see the subdirectories, then _www (or one of its groups) must also be able to read from the parent directory.  The easiest way would be to give everyone read permission of /Users/cduve <comment129912> @Kent Yeah I'll try that now but I'm a bit confused because the vhosts are subdirectories and they work fine! <comment129920> @Kent Unfortunately it didn't work! <comment130019> Well, now I'm stumped.  What happens if you make a simple file in /Users/cduve/test.html and try to access `localhost/test.html` with the browser? <comment130034> @Kent since localhost is set to /Users/cduve/Sites, I'm assuming you meant create /Users/cduve/Sites/test.html I tried that but still forbidden... If I put the same file in one of the subdirectories e.g. Sites/testsite/test.html no problem! The vhost is set to local.testsite.com which points to Sites/testsite <comment130392> How about when you use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost? <comment130395> @deesbek Same thing... <comment130396> oki mate, what web server are you running, what os 10.7, 10.8? on a mini, MBP? I would be keen to test and help you. <comment130397> @Deesbek Thanks man appreciate it! I'm running 10.9 on MBP <comment130398> ... and the webserver? Apache? Tomcat? versions? how was it set up? <comment130399> I would also have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/41185/10733 and post the output <comment130400> @Deesbek Apache I followed this [guide] (http://www.coolestguidesontheplanet.com/downtown/get-apache-mysql-php-and-phpmyadmin-working-osx-109-mavericks) to set it up. Output from terminal was `!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN" htmlhead title403 Forbidden/title /headbody h1Forbidden/h1 You don't have permission to access / on this server. /body/html` <comment130401> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11527/discussion-between-deesbek-and-doovers) <comment183510> Just to point out here, the default error log is at `/var/log/apache2/error_log`
