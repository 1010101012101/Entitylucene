How could passwords on OSX keychain for one user end up in another? <body> Our home MacBook has two users on it: my wife's and mine.  This morning we noticed when logged in as my wife's user that in the KeyChain Access it has all of my web passwords.  Including passwords I only use on my work laptop.  How is this possible?  To clarify exactly what's going on let's define some things:  ul liMacBooks ul liHome-macbook/li liHusband-work-macbook/li /ul/li liApple/iTunes accounts ul liWife-apple-account/li liHusband-apple-account/li /ul/li liOSX users on home-macbook ul liWife-osx-user (uses Wife-apple-account)/li liHusband-osx-user (uses Husband-apple-account)/li /ul/li liOSX users on work-macbook ul liEmployee-osx user (uses Husband-apple-account)/li /ul/li /ul  So this is what happened exactly:  On Home-macbook, logged in as Wife-osx-user, we could see passwords in the KeyChain Access program that were emonly/em emever/em emused/em on work-macbook as Employee-osx.  Now if Employee-osx passwords showed up on Home-macbook when logged into Husband-osx-user, that could make some sense.  But why are the passwords being shared between users?  Are they linked through OSX somehow and can I turn that off?  One important note is that this home-macbook was recently upgraded from Snow Leopard to Yosemite.  strongUpdate/strong  When I delete these passwords from the KeyChain Access app, they almost immediately are re-added automatically!  How can I stop this?!  <answer168972> The problem is that I have logged into Chrome under wife-osx-user.  Chrome saves passwords into keychain.   And then keychain makes those available to Safari.  Not AT ALL the desired behavior but I suppose it makes some sense.  <comment198389> Under the iCloud system Preference which user is logged in on the work-macbook and Home-macbook <comment198394> On Work-macbook the iCloud user is Husband-apple-account.  On home-macbook logged in as wife-osx-user, iCloud is not logged in.  ///something else freaky happening too, adding info above
