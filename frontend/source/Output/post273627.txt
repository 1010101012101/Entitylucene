Intel HD Graphics 6000 problem on Windows 10 <body> I have installed Windows 10 on external SSD (Windows to go feature). After that, i've installed WindowsSupport Drivers from Boot Camp. All devices work properly  except display. Display is flickering, there are artifacts. When i am disabling Intel HD Graphics driver in Device Manager, everything become normal, but graphical performace is low. I've tried installing older version of driver, but there are same flickering. What's the problem? How to fix this?
