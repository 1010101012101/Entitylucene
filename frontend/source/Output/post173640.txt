How to re-open a conversation? <body> So I can close a conversation in Messages on my Mac and it handily disappears.  I can't seem to figure out how to re-open that conversation manually (as opposed to getting a new message in that conversation, that is).  Closing means on the left panel of Messages. Hover over a person. An X appears in the middle of their "card" on the right. Click it. This closes the conversation and does not delete it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubfhW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know if reopening these conversations is possible?  <answer173641> emLate Edit:/em This is all dependant on you having "Save history when conversations are closed" checked in Messages prefs - otherwise you can find the conversation, but not rejoin it to your main chat window.  You cannot directly re-open the last conversation you had from the app itself, if you already closed it by hitting the x.  You need to dig in history, it's located at code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.ichat/Data/Library/Messages/code  Conversations are stored by date. You only need to find any one instance of the conversation you are looking for.  Double-clicking that file will reopen it in a separate window in Messages.br Keep that window open, or the next step fails.  To persuade it to reattach to the main windowâ€¦  Scroll down your conversations list - it will have reappeared in last place.  Select it, it will appear to be empty, but will fill as soon as you click it.  You can now close the extra window.  <answer174302> Easier still: just compose a new message to the person with whom you deleted the conversation, and as you hit enter to auto-complete the name, "poof!", the whole conversation reappears.  You don't need to send them any message.  <comment204292> Yeah, I wasn't asking how to start a new message.  And hitting the X doesn't "trash" it... it just hides it until the next new message is received or sent.  What I'm looking for is a way to re-open it without having to send (or receive) a new message. <comment204294> tweaked answer... <comment204297> Actually, I found a better method, answer tweaked again <comment204347> Finally - method 4, works every time. Edited again. <comment205283> That worked once for me... but then I couldn't get it to work again, even for the same person it originally worked for.
