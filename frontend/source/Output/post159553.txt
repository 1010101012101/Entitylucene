Switch to another app's active window only <body> Command+Tab and Command+Shift+Tab - toggles between apps  Command+` and Command+Shift+` - toggles between windows of the currently active app  Is there a way to switch to another app but only to the most recently active window (so that it doesn't dredge up the rest of the app's windows)?  I have multiple windows open for some apps and having this would be very handy especially if I have one has limited screen space.  If not available, is there a way to create such a shortcut through System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts for all applications?  Thanks!  <answer159927> There seem to be two proprietary programs that do solve this problem, but there isn't a way to set it up yourself using a keyboard shortcut.  The two apps are Witch (as suggested by Buscarì›ƒ) and Contexts, in case someone wanted to check them both out. Witch costs $14, and Contexts costs $9.  I'm trying both to see which one fits my needs most as both offer a free trial.  http://manytricks.com/witch/  https://contexts.co  <comment187500> did you look at this ? http://manytricks.com/witch/ <comment187508> No, thanks for showing it to me. I'll give it a test drive. Do you have any experience with using it?
