Bypass proxy settings for these Hosts & Domains not working (SOCKS proxy) <body> I have tested following two formats and both of them do not work:  ol licode223.223.192.0/20, 223.240.0.0/13, 223.248.0.0/14, 223.252.128.0/17, 223.254.0.0/16, 223.255.0.0/17, 223.255.236.0/22, 223.255.252.0/23/code/li licode223.223.192.0, 223.240.0.0, 223.248.0.0, 223.252.128.0, 223.254.0.0, 223.255.0.0, 223.255.236.0, 223.255.252.0/code/li /ol  What did I do wrong? I tried using domain and it works. I used the following formats in combination:  ol licode*.google.com/code/li licodegoogle.com/code/li /ol  <comment361589> format might be x.y/subnet. My default says `*.local, 169.254/16` <comment361690> @Tetsujin i don't want to bypass `*.local` or `169.254/16`. I want to bypass a list of hosts. <comment361787> ...which might be what I was saying... read again. <comment361901> Ohhh, right. it must be x.y/subnet. Okay, that kinda sucks.
