How to find Apple ID given my Game Center ID? <body> I remember my Game Center account ID. How do I find out what my Apple ID is? I tried to use all of my emails to recover my Apple ID but none of them work or they pull up old info for my other devices.  <answer156997> Are you unable to process any purchases on iTunes or the App Store? If you are on Mac, you might also find your ID using the Keychain Access application located in strong/Applications/Utilities/strong.  <comment184607> So you forgot the email address that your Apple ID was linked to? In: the email address you use to log in? If so, was it an Apple email address (zzz@icloud.com and others) or your default email address? <comment221073> If you forgot the email address, you should (on an iPhone or iPad) be able to open settings then click Game Center. The Apple ID email will be at the top of the page.
