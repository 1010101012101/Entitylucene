PF Port forwarding not working <body> I have the following rule in a file in code/etc/pf.anchors//code  precoderdr pass on lo0 inet proto {udp,tcp} from any to self port 25 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 1025 /code/pre  The intention is to forward all local traffic to port 25 onto port 1025, this is so sent emails can be captured before they are sent for testing email delivery on websites locally.  I then have added coderdr-anchor "foo"/code and codeload anchor "foo" from "/etc/pf.anchors/foo"/code into code/etc/pf.conf/code.  When I run codepfctl -v -n -f /etc/pf.conf/code I get the following:  precodeLoading anchor foo from /etc/pf.anchors/foo rdr pass on lo0 inet proto udp from any to 127.0.0.1 port = 25 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 1025 rdr pass on lo0 inet proto udp from any to 10.0.1.3 port = 25 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 1025 rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 127.0.0.1 port = 25 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 1025 rdr pass on lo0 inet proto tcp from any to 10.0.1.3 port = 25 -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port 1025 /code/pre  So it looks as if it should be working, however if I run an codenmap/code scan on the port it says closed, or if I send a test email with codeecho "This is the body of a text test-mail" | mail -s "Email test" test@test.com/code the email is not caught, but also doesn't seem to get sent.  The most strange thing is that I have pretty much the same configuration for codepf/code on my work mac and the forwarding works fine.   Any ideas would be great as I don't even really know how to debug this issue.  <answer171472> Turns out that I'm special and the issue wasn't with codepf/code at all. The problem was that postfix wasn't started! It'd still be interesting to know a way to test port forwarding though if anybody knows a tool for that.  <comment243330> You should mark your answer as the correct answer.
