How can I force sync my new Google contacts to Google? <body> I have already configured a Google account on my iPhone (now running iOS 10.0.1) a couple of years ago. Google is the default account for my new contacts. Some time ago I added the Two Factor Authentication to Google, but forgot to update the iPhone settings for Google. As a result, I have a ton of new contacts on my iPhone in the Google Contacts Group that have not been synced with the Google server (since it kept telling me that the credentials were not valid anymore for connecting to the Google servers). Now I have fixed this connection issue, but I have all these new "Google" contacts on my iPhone and they are not being pushed to Google. The only way I found to force a sync is to manually change each new/old contact and only then the contact is uploaded to Google.  Is there a way to force the iPhone to push to Google all the existing Google contacts (so it's not migrating iCloud contacts to Google or vice versa) without having to manually edit each one of them?
