FaceTime status of failed connection in unstable network condition <body> If there is a glitch in the network and an incoming FaceTime call did not go through (and recipient was actively waiting for the call), is it possible to show up in red as a missed call on the FaceTime receiver side?  This occurred with two iPhone 6 phones. No Mac computers or other devices were involved.   <comment315034> Your question is really not coherent, more stream of consciousness - but yes, if a phone isn't in range of a signal at the time a call is made, then it may report inaccurate information. If another compatible device was at that time able to receive the call - i.e., a Mac on & connected to the internet, then it would accurately report the missed call. Edge case, a Mac just on the edge of being able to bluetooth to the phone but not fully... Mac says missed call, phone doesn't.
