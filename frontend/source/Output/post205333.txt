Apple Backup Restore to Android <body> After reading the articles in the the latest Apple event (September/15) I remember reading something about Apple introducing the ability to restore backed up media/contacts to an Android device. I am not sure if this is an IOS 9 feature or an ICloud feature.  Since I read this I cannot find the original article or any other reference to this functionality.  Perhaps someone read or saw something about this and could provide me with a link or more details.  <answer205334> As if Apple would ever provide a way for you to leave them.  What you may be thinking of is Apple's Move to iOS app that went live on Google Play on September 16th (also iOS 9's release date), which lets you transfer everything from an Android to a new iDevice, not the other way around.  <comment247598> Thanks yes this must be it http://www.engadget.com/2015/06/08/apple-move-to-ios/ I must of misread.
