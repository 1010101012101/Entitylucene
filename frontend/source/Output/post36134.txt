Can I quickly delete all local music? <body> I subscribe to iTunes Match. I recently did a massive song metadata (tag/ID3) update without using iTunes itself. This appears to have updated the metadata in iCloud, but another issue appeared.  In my Music list, for albums that changed more significantly, they are now listed twice. Once without a Cloud icon (the previously downloaded version), and one with a Cloud icon. There are many of these albums, and identifying them and manually deleting them has become cumbersome.  Is there a function within iOS to allow me to delete all locally downloaded music? Essentially resetting the Music library state?  <answer36176> Be aware! If you delete the one without the iCloud symbol, there might be a chance you'll get an "File not found"-error when trying to play the song in the iCloud!  <answer36238> Go to Settings; Tap on codeGeneral/code  codeUsage/code  codeMusic/code, then swipe across codeAll Music/code and tap the delete button that appeared.  That should delete all your local music.  <comment41246> If you're having troubles with duplicates, you can use File  Display Duplicates... then COMMAND+A, Delete... to delete all duplicates <comment41266> There is no Command+A on an iPhone. <comment41321> Aha! I kept trying to swipe the Music category, not going into the category and swiping across the actual music type (vice Audiobooks/iTunes U/Podcasts). <comment41322> Surely things I deleted from iCloud via my iPhone will no longer be listed whatsoever?
