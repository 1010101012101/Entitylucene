Unable to remove login item from Users & Groups startup list <body> I have an item in my "Login Items" list (codeSystem Preferences &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Items/code) that refuses to be removed. When highlighted, the minus button grays out. The "hide" toggle is also grayed out. There is no option in this specific app to disable load on startup. Why is it showing this way and is there a general way (override) to remove such apps?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GVrat.png" alt="Login Items"  <answer74749> For some reason, Content Manager Assistant added the login item to code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code instead of code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code.  I was able to remove the login item by deleting code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginitems.plist/code and restarting (logging out and back in wasn't enough).
