Looking for Logs information <body> I'm trying to find information on general troubleshooting for the Mac including digging into the Log files, but I can't find any comprehensive info online.   What I'm looking for is general high level "This log will you show you this" / "When Kernel Panic look for XXX in logs" etc.  Will be happy if you can direct me to a book/site that has this info or dump any experience you have with logs.  <answer150826> In regards to most diagnostic information (including kernel panics), most logs are located in the following directory:     /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports    Most Low-Level logs are kept in:     /var/log   The file called isystem.log/i in code/var/log/code is particularly useful in a lot of situations, so if you experience a problem, the first step is to check the isystem.log/i file for any legible information.  <answer150833> I do not know of a 3d party application for that.  Since Apple already keeps a organized log of events, I use the Console.app located in the Utility folder.  When searching for something (kernel, Panic, Error ect..) I just type it in the "String Matching" window to sort by that.  Console keeps logs for about 3 days of history.  <comment177494> and using Console logs is not what you are after ? <comment177503> While correct---It does not really answer the question ""This log will you show you this" / "When Kernel Panic look for XXX in logs" etc."
