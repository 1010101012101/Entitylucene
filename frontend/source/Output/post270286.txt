Using a Network Drive in a Hybrid environment <body> Our organisation has always been a hybrid of Mac and PC users (work in the arts sector, so creatives typically need/are familiar with Apple, whereas the administrative side is entirely PC).   We moved from one venue to another and brought the existing network infrastructure with us, which included a number of shared drives. Historically, this has been hell and has caused no end of problems; files 'locked for editing' (when the user has their machine switched off), read only copies available, permissions issues, the list is in-exhaustive.  We deploy Active Directory and all the Mac's are bound to this domain with associated Windows accounts, with appropriate permissions. 80% of the time things work fine, but for the 20% that goes wrong, often there is no source of the issue found, and workarounds are instigated.  We're now facing the challenge of building a brand new domain infrastructure from scratch, including new file shares. Whilst there is a lot of troubleshooting on here for individual issues, there isn't much the way of best practices on setting up such a drive.  So I'm at drawing-board, blank slate planning mode; I'm making a new shared drive with a new, logical files structure pertaining to permissions;   h2Is there a specific known issue with Apple computers that causes permissions / locked for editing issues under these circumstances?/h2
