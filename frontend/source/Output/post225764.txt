Exception to smart quote substitution for one word <body> I have System Preferences|Keyboard enabled for smart quotes. Unfortunately, this tends to turn Hawai&lsquo;i into Hawai&rsquo;i even when I use Option&ndash;]. Any suggestion how to get emone/em word the way I want? (Not interested in global disable of smart quotes.)  <answer225769> It's a little clunky, but you could add a correction from "Hawai‘i" to "Hawai’i" in System Preferences  Keyboard  Text  <answer225781> The most correct character for the Hawaiian ʻokina is U+02BB, Modifier Letter Turned Comma.  It is a letter in its own right rather than punctuation.  Using that would hopefully avoid problems that can arise when a punctuation symbol like U+2018 Left Single Quotation Mark is used instead.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ʻOkina  <comment274042> I might try that (although, the other way around, the ‘ is correct).
