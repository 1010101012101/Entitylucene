Need to change phone number <body> When you update to iOS 8 you get asked a bunch of questions one of them is "what phone number to put in" how can I change it?   <answer146480> I assume these are questions related to your Apple ID. In this case you can point Safari to http://appleid.apple.com/ and update your data there.  <answer146481> Go to strongSettings/strong → strongPhone/strong → strongMy Number/strong and enter your phone number.  <comment172604> Do you have a screenshot? <comment172622> The only time I see a phone number on my iPad with any choice to enable or disable is with iMessage. Was that the prompt you are asking about?
