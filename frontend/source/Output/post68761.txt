Dictation not working in OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion <body> I have enabled dictation in the preferences, but it fails to start.  When I tap kbdfn/kbd kbdfn/kbd, the Icon with three dots appears, and quickly disappears. I don't see a microphone.  My system is connected to the Internet with an ADSL router, through an Ethernet LAN. I have temporarily disabled the router firewall, but it does not seem to help.  My system is in French (but I think "Dictation" should work since it is indeed called '"Dictée")  How can I have logs?  What can I investigate?  <answer75349> I had the same problem and it drove me crazy! This helped me:  ol liGo to code~/Library/Preferences/code ( kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdG/kbd )/li liLocate codecom.apple.assistant.plist/code and move it to the Trash/li liOpen emDictation &amp; Speech/em preference panel, disable dictation/li liReboot/li liRe-enable emDictation &amp; Speech/em./li /ol  Voila!  strongPS/strong This hint has the nicest side-effect: In Mail, all accounts used to be strongoffline/strong after sleep (Small triangle icons next to account), and would only come back on after quitting and restarting Mail.app. Now, all is well again. Ts!  <comment87822> +1 for your answer, but I can't confirm I can't formally accept it, because I did no specific actions, and Dication is working today. <comment87826> Good to hear it works now! Can’t confirm you can’t accept? Yes please :) And merry Holidays to You.
