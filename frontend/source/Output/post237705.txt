'cat' not displaying line breaks <body> For some reason codecat/code no longer shows line breaks when I use it, while all other tools (codegrep/code, codemore/code etc) do.  I am using iterm2 on OSX 10.11.4.  What could be causing this behaviour?  strongExample/strong  I have a file codetest.txt/codecreated in vim:  precodethis is a test this is a test this is a test /code/pre  When I do codecat test.txt/code the output is (note space in place of newline):    precodethis is a test this is a test this is a test /code/pre  <answer237710> These things can occur based on a whole bunch of small issues, either in the shell used, the terminal application used, the file format or something else altogether.  To triage, the following steps may be useful  ul lirun codecat -vet test.txt/code to see whether there are additional characters in the file/li lirun code(echo a; echo b)|cat/code to see if it depending on the input data/li liswitch terminal applications to see if this is the cause/li lirun codebash --noprofile/code to see whether something is lurking in the shell configuration/li /ul  In my case someone had modified 'cat' behaviour in .bashrc
