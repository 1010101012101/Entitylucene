Always boot windows, unless option is held down <body> I have a 2012 Retina Macbook pro I use for work, with software that is windows only.   I'm getting a bit tired of having to remember to hold down the option key every time I reboot.  I know I can tell bootcamp to "reboot into windows", but that only sticks for one reboot.  I want to strongalways/strong boot into windows, unless I hold the the option key. How can I do this?  <answer248188> From: Boot Camp: Set the default operating system     After installing Windows, you can set the default operating system.   br   br   strongSet the default operating system in OS X/strong      ol   liIn OS X, choose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Startup Disk./li   liSelect the startup disk with the default operating system you want to use./li   liIf you want to start up using the default operating system now, click Restart./li   /ol      strongSet the default operating system in Windows/strong      You can’t change your startup volume to an external FireWire or USB   drive while you're using Windows.      ol   liIn Windows 7, click the Boot Camp icon in the system tray, then choose Boot Camp Control Panel.

This also sets the default operating system to OS X.      If you don’t see the Boot Camp icon in the system tray, click the   triangle to show hidden icons.   <comment306421> I could have sworn I did that and it didn't stick, but I just checked and it seems to work. Apparently I'm just dumb. <comment307625> Another option is, when the computer is starting up, hold down the Alt/Option key to choose the startup OS. When you're ready to select the startup OS, hold down the Ctrl key. When the Ctrl key is held down, you should see a mostly closed circle with an arrow over the drive/OS to show that it will restart with that one selected next time if nothing else changes.
