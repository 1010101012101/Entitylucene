Is there a VGA to Thunderbolt/mini DisplayPort adapter? <body> I am looking for an adapter to connect my Apple display to a Sony notebook via VGA, so I need the reverse of this one:  img src="https://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT3382/HT3382_7-mdp_vga_connector--001-mul.png" alt="Image of Apple mini DisplayPort-to-VGA connector."  Does such a product exist?  <answer40503> VGA is an analog signal and your Cinema requires digital so you need more than a simple cable. You need an appropriate interface box, called a VGA to DVI Scaler, such as the Gefen VGA to DVI Scaler Plus. (Shown for reference only—this is not a recommendation.)  You will also need the appropriate adaptor to use the DVI signal with your monitor.  emPlease note that I don't have experience with these products and can't guarantee results—particularly if your Display is the thunderbolt-equipped model. Contact the vendors to assure yourself that it will work./em  <answer40504> You will need a VGA to DVI scaler ($330 in mentioned link) + DVI to MDP adapter like this one ($70). And after that no guarantee that it will work all together.
