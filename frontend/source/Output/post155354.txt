Shell not opening binary pointed to by 'which' <body> I installed vim74 using homebrew, and codewhich vim/code returns it's path. However when i open vim, i still get into the version coming with OSX (code/usr/share/vim/code). Why is that even though code/usr/share/code is not in my codePATH/code? How can i fix it?  <comment182744> The path in launchd is not affected by changes in the path in ~/. files - see many questions here about path in GUI <comment182769> Reinstall the formula. If installation went fine, you should be able to run it at first. `which` command should point to `/usr/local/bin/vim` without changes in your path nor your `.bash_profile`.
