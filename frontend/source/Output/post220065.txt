Unable to use itunes file sharing? <body> I am running iTunes 12.1.2 under Windows XP on virtualbox on host Ubuntu 15.10, and my iPad 3 is on ios 9.2. I have a really weird issue.    iTunes detects my device fine but when I go to apps and scroll down to file sharing and click on infuse(my video player), the list of files is empty, even though there are many files on my device. Also, when I try to add a file, nothing happens. However, if I reboot my iPad, and then connect it to iTunes, I am able to share files, but if I disconnect my device and reconnect, its the same issue all over again.    Any suggestions?
