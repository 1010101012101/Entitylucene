Cancel accidental Siri activation <body> strongHow do I tell Siri to go away when I activate it by accident?/strong  The best I can come up with is "Cancel", which works but replies that "there's nothing to cancel". Functional, but irritating.  Searching on Google has thus far just turned up a whole lot of stuff about how to turn Siri off altogether, which isn't what I'm after.  <answer239247> You can press the home button again or say "Goodbye"  <answer239266> Other than pressing the home button or sleep button, you can say a list of words:  ul liGoodbye/li liBye/li liSee you/li liSo long/li liSee you soon/later/li /ul  <answer285041> "Thank you, that's all" also works  <comment293560> Try "Goodbye" and Siri will reply "Bye!" Or something
