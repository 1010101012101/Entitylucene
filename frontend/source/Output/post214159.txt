Why do my versions of Java differ? <body> If I codebrew --config/code, I see  precode#... Java: 1.8.0_60 /code/pre  which is what my my OS X Java Control Panel reported until I recently updated. Now the control panel reports the new version     Java 8 Update 65   but codebrew --config/code continues to report the old one.  Why do these two versions of Java differ? I haven't explicitly installed a different Java with Homebrew, and had always thought that Homebrew was reporting the version of he one Java I'm aware of: the one I installed when Java notified be of an update.  <answer258418> Accoding to the Java 8 JRE documentation     Installing a JRE from Oracle will not update java -version symlinks or add java to your path. To be able to do this, you need to install the JDK.   To solve this problem, you have to install the JDK.  One easy way to do it is with Homebrew-Cask :  precodebrew cask install java /code/pre  If you already installed a previous java version via Homebrew Cask :  precodebrew cask reinstall java /code/pre  <comment258509> How exactly did you update Java i.e. exact URLs etc <comment258514> Using the Java Updater: it notified me of the update and I accepted it.
