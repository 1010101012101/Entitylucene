How do I stop the "Are you sure you want to open it?" dialog box from displaying when I open an app? <body> Every time I open the "Amazon MP3 Downloader" app (by downloading a new MP3 from Amazon.com in Safari) I get this dialog box: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cgotp.png" alt="alt text"  I'm used to seeing this the first time after I open a new app I've downloaded, but usually I don't see the dialog box after the first time I press the "Open" button.  Is there a setting somewhere I can use to indicate that yes, I am sure I want to open "Amazon MP3 Downloader" without this dialog box?  <answer1236> Create a file called codecom.apple.DownloadAssessment.plist/code under codeLibrary/Preferences/code with the following:  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"    "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;LSRiskCategoryNeutral&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;LSRiskCategoryContentTypes&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;public.item&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Then log out and then log back in.  Instructions for Snow Leopard are a bit different.  <answer1240> if you use Deeper you can mark it in General tab.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJJV6.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer1244> Deeper would be a good choice but I would suggest you to use strongOnyX/strong  OnyX provides a few more features than Deeper, allowing you to verify the Startup Disk and the structure of its System files and to delete caches. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WMHoH.png" alt="alt text"  <answer1245> If you need to do this manually on a file (or files) you can run the following command to remove the Quarantine flag:  precodexattr -d com.apple.quarantine /PATH/TO/FILE(S) /code/pre  So in your case since the quarantine flag is not being removed you will want to run the command with codesudo/code as the primary cause for the flag not being removed after hitting "Open" is because you don't have permissions to do so.  <comment1130> Will this turn off the alert message when downloading other (new) applications? <comment1131> Good information, but I just want to turn off the alert for the one particular app. <comment1132> Good information, but I just want to turn off the alert for the one particular app. <comment1133> The quarantine flag does seem to be removed for other applications I've downloaded since.  Are the permissions set separately for each app? <comment1134> How do I give myself permission to remove quarantine flags? <comment1137> @Daryl Spitzer: Most likely it's just because of Amazon's app only. Using `sudo` in front of that command will allow you to do the command as if you were root and make sure it takes effect. If it fails to work, change `-d` to `-dr` and run it with sudo in case there is another program inside with the flag. <comment1152> @Daryl: Yes. Otherwise you can use **Chealion**'s solution to manually remove the quarantine flag. <comment1208> xattr worked (with the -d option) but I did need to use sudo
