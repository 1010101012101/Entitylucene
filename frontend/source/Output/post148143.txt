iPhone 4 restarts again and again, not detected by PC <body> I have a network locked phone which my uncle sent my from foriegn. I previously updated it to iOS 7.0.4 and activated it using Hactivate tool because I did not have the network SIM. I used it for 6 months normally. Then I JailBroke my iPhone using evasi0n 7. It again worked normly for 2 months. But it curropted some of iOS applications including Mail, Safari, etc. I tried to restore it to iOS 7.0.4 but Apple didn't allow me. So I made a backup and restored to latest iOS 7.1.2 for iPhone 4. It was sucessful but again activation through SIM needed.  I used similar Hactivate tool again. But it stuck and sucked!!  Now I am holding a iPhone 4 which   ol liRestarts, stucts on Apple logo and again restarts and so on until it has some battery./li liPC does not detect it./li liAnd it does not turn on or turn off on my will./li liHolding Power and Home button does nothing./li /ol  Any solution??  <answer148144> Have you ever had a battery replacement?
