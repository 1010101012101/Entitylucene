How to faster join wifi hotspot (iphone) from my mac? <body> I enabled WiFi hotspot on my iPhone. I am only able to connect to it from my MAC only if iPhone screen is on.   Some days ago I shared wifi on my iPhone to another iPhone and I was able to connect to the hotspot even with disabled screen on phone with hotspot.  How I can "just open macbook and join hotspot, event when my iPhone is locked and it is in my bag"?
