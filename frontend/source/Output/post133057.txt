How to enable scrolling with the mouse wheel in Safari? <body> I am currently running OSX 10.9.3 and Safari Version 7.0.4. When using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome, I am able to scroll using the mouse wheel just fine. But with Safari, it does not work. How am I able to enable this feature?  <comment157616> What kind of mouse do you have? Does it have some special configuration software? Scrolling with a mouse wheel should work fine anywhere. <comment157625> @deceze I have a Logitec N50 mouse. It does not have any special configuration software, at least to my knowledge. <comment157629> why did you post here that you can scroll in Chrome, but here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/133052/how-to-enable-scrolling-with-the-mouse-wheel-in-google-chrome that you can't? <comment157648> @dwightk Because that issue has been resolved. How is that relevant to this question? <comment157652> It was just weird.
