Increased the Size of Bootcamp Partition but Winclone Restores Old Size Partition <body> I followed all documented steps to increase the Bootcamp partition size on the Mac OS 10.5.x. I used Winclone, Disk Utility and Bootcamp Assistant to perform this operation. In short, I cloned Windows with Winclone as image, erased Windows with Bootcamp Assistant, repartitioned hard drive with new size for Mac and Windows in Bootcamp Assistant, restored image to newly sized Bootcamp partition, and everything seemed almost fine EXCEPT...   Winclone restored image as a separate small partition equal to the same old size and remaining Bootcamp partition, which I wanted to use for Windows, appeared as Free Space.  What can I do to make sure I restore that small Windows image into a bigger Bootcamp partition and it occupies the entire space allocated for Windows? Thank you.
