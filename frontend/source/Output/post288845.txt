Get original MAC address when MAC address spoofed using CPP or Terminal <body> I tried changing the MAC address of my MacBook Pro. The command I used to change the MAC address is: codesudo ifconfig en0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx/code.  Now if I run codeifconfig en0/code in Terminal.app it shows the changed MAC address. To get the original MAC address of the en0 interface I can run codenetworksetup -listallhardwareports/code in Terminal.app. But the problem I am facing is if I mask the emnetworksetup/em command then I can make it give the MAC address which I want.   What is the way which will not allow a user to block a particular application to access the original MAC address?  Which is the location with system protected of modification, where I can get the original MAC address?  <comment364820> At least your last sentence is unclear! The MAC address is stored in the controller of the NIC either in ROM or firmware! <comment364824> HI  klanomath, What is the command which can fetch the details from NIC <comment364825> How to read MAC address stored in Controller <comment364827> probably `ioreg` (with some piping to grep and awk to get the MAC of en0 only) or `system_profiler` (system_profiler may call ioreg itself) <comment364828> I used "networksetup -listallhardwareports" to fetch the MAC address. We can mask networksetup to get the modified MAC address.
