iPhone Keyboard font <body> How do I make my Keyboard font on iPhone 6 larger? I have tried enlarging my fonts on the phone - it only enlarges the typed words I need to have the Keyboard Lager, my fingers are too large so when I type I keep hitting the wrong letters. How can I increase the size of my KEYBOARD?  <answer262641> You can't change the size of the keyboard itself, that's fixed.  What you can do is find 3rd-party keyboards on the App Store such as Thick Buttons or Minuum.  <answer262649> The keyboard can't be made larger, try finding a third-party keyboard which has support for that.
