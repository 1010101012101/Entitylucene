Why is there a hosts.equiv file in my /etc folder? <body> I'm running OS 10.11.1 on my Macbook Pro.  I should also preface my question with the admission that my knowledge of the Mac OS is practically zero.  I was looking at (not editing) the hosts file in my /etc folder on my standard account that I use for everyday internet browsing. While going to the /etc folder, I noticed the existence of a hosts.equiv file.  For every previous incarnation of my Macbook that's run Mavericks/Yosemite/etc, I've never noticed a hosts.equiv file before in the /etc folder.  Running codeman hosts.equiv/code in Terminal lets me know that it's a list of trusted hosts/users for remote authentication...which I have absolutely no use for or knowledge of how to even implement.  My question is: the mere existence of the hosts.equiv file isn't evidence that my machine is compromised, right? When I open the file with Text Edit, there's nothing listed in it.  <answer213324> If you are concerned that a file isn't installed by Apple then check the package receipts-  precodepkgutil --file-info /private/etc/hosts.equiv volume: / path: /private/etc/hosts.equiv  pkgid: com.apple.pkg.BSD pkg-version: 10.6.0.1.1.1249367152 install-time: 1324303327 uid: 0 gid: 0 /code/pre  mode: 644  You can then check the BOM file-  precodelsbom /private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.BSD.bom | grep hosts.equiv ./private/etc/hosts.equiv   100644  0/0 0   4294967295 /code/pre  Note the last 0 is the file size and the last field is the check sum of the installed file. Now check the check sum of the file-  precodecksum /private/etc/hosts.equiv 4294967295 0 /private/etc/hosts.equiv /code/pre  Note the check sum is the same as what is recorded in the BOM file and codecksum/code reports the file size as zero bytes.   <comment257635> I should also clarify that I was looking at the hosts.equiv file in the /etc folder, not the /private/etc/ folder. Is there a major difference? <comment257640> But regardless, I've tried running the commands you've listed: <comment257642> But regardless, I've tried running the commands you've listed:  `pkgutil --file-info /private/etc/hosts.equiv volume: / path: /private/etc/hosts.equiv  pkgid: com.apple.pkg.Essentials pkg-version: 10.11.0.1.1.1442471843 install-time: 1444627255 uid: 0 gid: 0 mode: 644`  I've tried running `lsbom` with `/private/var/db/receipts/com.apple.pkg.Essentials.bom | grep hosts.equiv` but I always get a no such file or directory found error.  Running `cksum /private/etc/hosts.equiv` gets me `4294967295 0 /private/etc/hosts.equiv` `man hosts.equiv`
