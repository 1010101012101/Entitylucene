iPhone 5s Changed phone number what happens when contacted at old <body> What happens when you get a new cell number and someone texts or calls the old number?  Do they get some sort of response?  <comment300277> Only if your provider has some kind of redirect system, otherwise it's just a dead old number. It has nothing to do with the phone, it's entirely a provider issue.
