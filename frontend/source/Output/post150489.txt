Strange stripes in AirPort Utility window <body> What are this weird stripes in only this window (AirPort Utility) and can I get rid of them? Sometimes this bug does not appear, but most still it do. I thought it depends on the screen resolution, but I was mistaken. MBP retina late 2013, OS X 10.9.5.
