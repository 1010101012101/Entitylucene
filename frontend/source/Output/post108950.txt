How can i get Facebook back if the app won't re-download? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBdJ9.jpg" alt="What comes up when I try to re-download"  iPhone Facebook app had a "bug fix" update so I clicked it and it wouldn't load. I deleted the app and reinstalled and now it keeps saying it can't be downloaded at this time. I've tried re-downloading it with both my Wi-Fi on and off and it still doesn't work!  <answer110003> The servers of Apple did not allow downloading the Facebook application for some (unknown) reason. It was probably a bug.  Downloading Facebook on the iPhone now works again (at least in France).  <comment127590> Have you tried connecting your iPhone to iTunes, downloading the application to iTunes and then transferring the app across to the iPhone? I had this problem with an earlier version (5.x) and this is how I got around it and then it was suddenly fine again! <comment127591> I dont have a computer/laptop to do that. Is there any other solution? <comment129627> I know it'll sound silly but... have you tried turning it off and on again ? (oh and you can do a screenshot on your iphone by pressing the home and power buttons simultaneously ;)) <comment129628> Yep it's up and running again thanks everyone :) <comment129629> I switched it on and off, still didn't work (last night) but all good it's up and running again now thanks everyone :)
