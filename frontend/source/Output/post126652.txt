Random keyboard actions in Parallels Desktop 9 <body> I'm running PD9 here on Mavericks and I mainly use Visual Studio 2013. Constantly it seems like PD is getting incorrect keyboard input. Suddenly Visual Studio changes to a new file or the Windows start menu opens.  For instance: it looks like it is missing to catch key combinations like ALT+Page Down, instead does Page Down only and then connect the ALT modifier to the next pressed key, which will trigger a different actions.  Any ideas what could be causing this?  <comment148377> What keyboard layout are you using within Windows? What keyboard layout are you using on Mac OS X? When you install Parallels Tools on your Windows virtual machine, it installs some custom Parallels keyboard layouts for Windows. You may have inadvertently selected or toggled between different keyboard layouts in either Windows or Mac OS X, or both, and this may be confusing things.
