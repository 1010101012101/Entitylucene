Unedit a document in Preview <body> I have several edited documents in Preview — with annotations, drawings and highlighted parts — which I would like to share as their original version.  Is there a simple way to do that?  <comment350542> Got Time Machine running? Also, Preview has a **File:Revert to:Browse all versions...** Menu item that may prove useful to you. Be sure to back things up before you go and revert them. You can lose stuff otherwise.
