Help recovering corrupted partition table? <body> I went to install Sierra over El Capitan on my wife's MacBook Pro.  Stuck in a boot loop that it can't be installed and restore mode disk util sees only one drive, no restore partition, and cannot repair the disk.    Can I correct the partition table by hand, and if so how?br Which screenshots or utility outputs would help?   <comment357514> Boot to recovery mode, open Terminal from the menubar  Utilities and enter `gpt -r show disk0` and `diskutil list`, take a pic and insert it in your question.
