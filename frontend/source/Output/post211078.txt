Schedule regular filesystem verification <body> I recently had a baffling several days troubleshooting some odd network problems, which was eventually narrowed down to my MacBook's Wifi adapter and then finally fixed by performing a disk repair to resolve a few problems with the filesystem (which Apple support said can manifest as random OS behavioral issues :/).  To prevent this from happening again, is there an easy way to run disk verification on, say, a monthly schedule? Ideally, it would run in the background and only notify me if errors are found.
