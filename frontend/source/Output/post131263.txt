Prevent facetime from asking for password in Mavericks <body> Some time ago I've updated to OSX Mavericks. Since then each time after the system starts I get a prompt to enter Facetime password. How to disable this?  <answer131264> Found the solution:  ul liOpen FaceTime,/li liOpen "FaceTime" menu,/li liChoose "Turn FaceTime off" option./li /ul  <comment154156> glad to see you answered your question that was bit misleading. You wanted to disable facetime, not have it autocomplete the password entry. <comment154213> Well, I wasn't sure what I want to do, I just wanted the dialog to disappear :-) <comment154214> @XAleXOwnZX: I can do that in two days.
