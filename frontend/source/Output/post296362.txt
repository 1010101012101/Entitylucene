Paid Applications Contract with Apple (from Germany) - W8-BEN & EIN <body> I want to apply for the 'Paid Applications Contract' and I am a bit overwhelmed, thus a couple of questions. I have created a one-man business ( Einzelunternehmen ) in Germany, but it is not a LLC (Limited Liability Business), and I want to sell apps and app-content with In-App-Purchases.  Questions:  ol liDo I need to apply for an EIN or ITIN? I read that I need to do that in order to avoid paying taxes twice (Germany and the U.S.). Is that true?/li liDo I need to fill out this on the W8-BEN Form: 6. Foreign tax identifying number?. If yes, this is my german tax number I assume?/li liDo I need to fill out this on the W8-BEN Form: 7. Reference Number. If yes, what does it refer to?/li liDo I need to fill out this on the W8-Ben Form: 10. Special rates and Conditions. I think there is a contract between the US and Germany to avoid paying withholding tax (german: Quellsteuer). If this is applicable to avoid paying taxes twice,  what article/paragraph and which rate in % should i state there. In this regard, do I need to fill out the "Explain the additional conditions in the Article and paragraph ..."/li /ol  I would very appreciate help from you (maybe there is an experienced german developer or someone from Apple Finance), because after hours of researching I could not find any good reliable information. I hope all my questions are understandable.   Thank you in advance.  <comment374315> Do you have to pay taxes on royalties in Germany? In The Netherlands you donâ€™t have to pay taxes like VAT on royalties. Only taxes with your income tax. <comment374321> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Unfortunately I've had to close this question as it is too broad.
