Disable the text/html part in outgoing messages in OS X 10.8's Mail application <body> I'm using the emMail/em application bundled with emOS X 10.8/em. When switching from emMac OS X 10.6/em, I noticed that Mail now always includes a codetext/html/code part, alongside the codetext/plain/code part, in messages that include an image as attachment, even if the message's text has not been formatted in any way. Adding a different file type as attachment does not show that behavior.  The second problem is that the attached image is contained in the codetext/html/code part and not the codetext/plain/code part. Recipients whose mail clients (by configuration or by default) display the codetext/plain/code part do not see the attached image, which is very annoying.  Is there a way to make Mail never include a codetext/html/code part, by configuration or by using a specific method to insert the attachment?  <comment94682> text/plain cannot show an image so what do you expect the email to consist of? <comment94715> @Mark Of course it can! You can use a content-type of `multipart/mixed` and set the content-disposition of the part with the image to `inline` (see RFC 1341 and RFC 2183). This will result in what is often called an "inline attachment". This works independent of the content-type parts containing the message's text. This is what was happening in earlier versions of the Mail application. <comment94724> This discussion may be of interest:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3209246?start=0&tstart=0
