How do i change the column type in Numbers from number to string <body> I have a column in numbers with zipcodes. The zipcodes have leading zeros, only the column drops the leading zeros.  I assume this is because the column thinks it's a number and not a string.  I tried right clicking on the column header to get a menu item to to change the type but couldn't find anything.  How can I change the column type from number to string?  <answer274344> ol liHighlight the cells you want to change. /li liClick the paintbrush icon to display the Formatting sidebar./li liIn the codeData Format/code dropdown, select codeText/code/li /ol
