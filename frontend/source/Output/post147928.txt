App Store Software Update download speed is super slow <body> My connection right now is 200 Mbit/s download and upload for any kind of internet usage except downloads over the app store.  I want to download a software update and I'm getting maybe 1 Mbit/s.  I tried these "fixes" I found in the internet:  ul liI turned Certificate Revocation List (CRL) in the Keychain Access preferences off./li liI changed my DNS to 8.8.8.8./li /ul  It doesn't help. The downloads stay super slow. What can I do?  <comment174388> Clearly the problem is not on your site. <comment174907> Maybe Apple's content delivery network was just being slow that day.
