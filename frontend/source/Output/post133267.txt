a1242 keyboard works different than macbook keyboard. WHY? <body> I have this keyboard connected as external to my macbook while using external monitor. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WuVle.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  A1242 model.  When I press kbdalt ⌥/kbd + kbdcmd ⌘/kbd + kbd-/kbd on right side from kbdspace/kbd this combination is not working, when on my macbook keyboard it works! Why?  The:  kbdalt ⌥/kbd + kbdcmd ⌘/kbd + kbd&lt;-/kbd  or  kbdalt ⌥/kbd + kbdcmd ⌘/kbd + kbd-/kbd on the left side from kbdspace/kbd   are wokring OK.
