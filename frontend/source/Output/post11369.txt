ITunes volume noticeably lower than browser volume <body> Can anyone think of a reason why (and a possible solution) the volume on my ITunes player is lower than other apps (like for example playing videos on youtube or music in grooveshark)?  <answer11374> Perhaps you're not aware that there is a volume slider on the iTunes window?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wGcnC.png" width="134"  Also, Are you using an Equalizer? (Window - Equalizer)  Change the preamp setting if you feel it is too quiet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMYPR.png" width="440"  <comment11941> Please. I'm not an idiot <comment11956> Hey, some people may just say "doh, I hadn't even noticed!" <comment11957> @Pablo I added to my answer with another method to affect the volume in iTunes. <comment11958> That did it! Thanks a lot @ghoppe
