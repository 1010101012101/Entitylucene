OSX Hierarchy questions and organization <body> I've done extensive searching on these questions and have even come across others, however, they do not answer any of my questions.  ul liWhat are ~/Library and /Library for respectively? I can see they store certain applications, but why there and not /Applications or ~/Applications? I'm confused between the 4./li liIn my personal system, I see go, git, and android-sdk directories in /usr/local for these programs. Why would these not be stored in those application or library directories I mentioned above?/li liI know this is all down to choice, but where do I store, or what is a common place to store libraries such as boost that I would use across all of my C++ programs?/li liin line with the question above, where should I store the projects/source files for my C++, Java, IOS, Android, etc. projects? I feel like my system right now is very unorganized with some projects on my desktop, home directory, etc. because of my ignorance on these things, I want to find a good, organized system./li /ul  <answer176197> This might be good reading material for all your questions.  OS X Mavericks Core Technologies Overview October 2013  http://www.apple.com/media/us/osx/2013/docs/OSX_Mavericks_Core_Technology_Overview.pdf  <answer176231> OS X spawns from two different cultures: Unix/POSIX and Mac OS.  Folders like code/usr/code, code/var/code, code/etc/code, the command line shell in the Terminal (codebash/code by default) all belong to POSIX environment. Portable software targeting Unix-based systems (like codegit/code) go into code/usr/local/code by default, or into package manager's defined location if installed by it (Homebrew uses code/usr/local/code, MacPorts use code/opt/local/code).  codeLibrary/code, codeApplications/code, code/System/code and others belong to Mac OS specifically. Apple's software, services, and GUIs of third-party apps go there.  The code~/code symbol in path is a traditional way to denote path to current user's home folder. Things that must not be seen by other user accounts go into code~/.../code counterpart. For example, Mail keeps emails in code~/Library/code, but standard stationery templates in code/Library/code.  codeLibrary/code folders are supposed to be accessed by applications programmatically, not browsed by user via Finder. Since 10.9, code~/Library/code is hidden so that users won't unknowingly screw anything there.  There are no out-of-the-box recommendations how to store your files. They will be as good organized as you are good in organizing. They only thing to say in context of OS X is that your files must be in the home folder, but not in code~/Library/code, and probably not in code~/Public/code which exists to share files with others.
