Three finger tap lookup no longer show Wikipedia pages since upgrading to Sierra <body> First, it showed nothing but I had to go to the dictionary and download it but now I can't lookup things that aren't in the dictionary, that would previously result in it showing me a Wikipedia page.  Any way to fix this?  <answer268769> Apple uses Spotlight Suggestions for this functionality since El Capitan: https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21573     If youâ€™re using OS X v10.10.3 or later and Spotlight Suggestions are enabled in Spotlight preferences, you may also see information about related music, movies, or map locations.   But Spotlight Suggestions are disabled for some reason in most countries: http://www.apple.com/macos/feature-availability/#spotlight-suggestions  Check if your country is in the Supported list. If not, you're out of luck at the moment, just as me. I couldn't find any emnormal/em workaround, that doesn't involve constant VPN connection. If you're OK with VPN inconvenience, cost and additional latency, you may check this solution: https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/3cln0j/how_can_you_enable_spotlight_suggestions_in_mac/  Supported countries at the time of writing:  ul liAustralia/li liAustria/li liBelgium/li liCanada/li liFrance/li liGermany/li liIreland/li liItaly/li liJapan/li liMexico/li liNetherlands/li liNew Zealand/li liSpain/li liSwitzerland/li liUK/li liUSA/li /ul  <comment318092> The support article: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204352.
