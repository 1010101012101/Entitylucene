Is there a programmatic way to identify built-in applications? <body> I'm trying to keep an inventory of where each application in my Mac came from (context: I'm trying to be disciplined and install things only through the App Store, Homebrew or Caskroom).  Apps that came from the App Store can be identified because their application bundle contains a code_MASReceipt/code directory. Is there a similar trick to identify the built-in applications? One idea is to check if codeCFBundleIdentifier/code in codeInfo.plist/code starts with codecom.apple/code. Any others?  <comment211824> Nice idea! Why not go with the CFBundleIdentifier approach? <comment220470> Look in /Library/Receipts
