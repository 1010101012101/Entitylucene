Changing dashboard space <body> I realized the other day that I never use the dashboard and had no desire to. So I decided to disable it. But I feel as if the 3 finger swipe to the right that had displayed it is now wasted. Can something else fill that space?  <answer95702> You can always add more spaces by clicking the kbd+/kbd button in the upper right when you swipe up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZoyM.png" width="345"  <comment112318> Yes, but you still must always have a desktop on the far left side. What I'm shooting for in a centered desktop space. So I can swipe either way to get to my apps. <comment112319> @AaronAAA that was not your original question so please EDIT <comment112320> Incomplete question !
