How do I deal with an automatic reboot following a cydia app install <body> The tethered RedSnOw jailbreak for 5.1 worked like a charm.  I ran into a problem when I installed winterboard however.  Following the automatic reboot, I couldn't get my iPhone into DFU mode to use the "just reboot" function.  What am I doing wrong?    <answer49403> There shouldn't be anything different about getting your device into DFU mode after a Cydia-initiated reboot compared to a normal reboot.  Generally if people have trouble getting into DFU mode, the causes can include: not having the latest version of iTunes installed, using a USB hub/a bad USB cable/a bad USB port, holding the buttons for the wrong amount of time (or pressing them too hard sometimes), or having faulty buttons.  <answer50568> Restore your iphone/ipod to 5.1 then jailbreak it again.  <answer54263> Well, good news for you. As from a few weeks ago, you are able to jailbreak your iOS 5.1 stronguntethered/strong, which eliminates the fact you've to "just-boot" the iPhone very time.  In order to do so, Jailbreak nation has published a very detailed and good tutorial on how to jailbreak your iPhone. I suggest you preform a untetheredjailbreak and try again. If things are still not working, please give some feedback with your errors so we can help you further.br Good luck!  <comment57960> You shouldn't have to restore and jailbreak again - you should be able to boot tethered using redsn0w. If redsn0w isn't working, there is probably a way to make it work.
