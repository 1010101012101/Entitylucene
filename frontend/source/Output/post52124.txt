TextMate is only showing some bundles, and not highlighting my code anymore <body> I use TextMate for all my Python programming, but recently it stopped highlighting my Python code. I have also tried YAML, which isn't highlighted either.  When I click Bundles, I only see the "Blogging", "HTML", "Hyperlink Helper" and "JavaScript" bundles.  I would like to just do a clean reinstall of TextMate, but I'm not sure what I should delete. Overwriting the app with a newly downloaded copy doesn't help. I've also tried deleting the application support directory, but that only contained the 3rd party bundles, so that doesn't change anything.  <answer52125> See it this works. Goto Bundle Editor  Reload Bundles.  <comment59643> nope, it does not. But I suppose textmate automatically does this at startup, and I've restarted textmate multiple times. <comment59645> thx, that was the answer, if you post that as an answer, I'll accept it. <comment59651> unchecking the filters. I thought that it would only filter the list of visible bundles, and after checking the filters, I forgot I checked them.  I can post it as an answer, but then you don' get the rep for it.
