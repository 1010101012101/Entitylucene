Trouble moving tons of files from OS X server attached RAID to NAS <body> I am trying to move many thousands of files to a Synology NAS.  Thanks to excellent posts here and superuser, I have been using rsync a lot. But in this case, I'm getting a very high failure rate due to years of permissions problems across the board.   Any ideas on how I can get all these files copied, either by straightening out the permissions issues, or bypassing them? Once on the NAS, the permissions won't matter.  <answer207549> Assuming these are emread/em permission issues you should be able to overcome them by running  precodesudo rsync â€¦ /code/pre  If you don't need the various read permissions on the original files, you can also use  precodesudo chown -R $USER source/dir  /code/pre  first to change file ownership to yourself.   <comment250311> Which specific error messages are you getting? If it really are just read permission issues, `chmod`/`chown` (or using `sudo rsync ...`) should suffice. <comment250356> Hi I definitely use "sudo" each time.  `So for example I'll see "rsync: opendir (location) failed: Permission denied 13 `  Many users in this network have various permissions issues, locked out of certain files and folders, while others can access, and so I'm presuming this is the same mess. <comment250358> Can you spell out what chmod/chown command I could use on the entire massive directory without messing up anything? <comment250365> Hold the phone! User error? I may have forgotten to use sudo *headsmack* Thank you for the clarity. <comment250875> There were a small batch of files that didn't copy by rsync due to permissions problems. This actually required me to drag and drop them, which gave me a prompt to enter the administrator credentials due to permissions. And for sure I was using sudo
