Setting and getting the system-wide default newline character <body> Is there a system-wide way to configure the default newline character? If so, is there a way to query what this character is?  <answer287523> No, there is not any way to configure the newline character system wide.  Modern macOS applications typically use code\n/code (Unicode character U+000A) as the line separator.  Applications developed for Classic Mac OS (i.e, Mac OS 9 and earlier) often used code\r/code (Unicode U+000D) as a line separator, but this usage is extremely rare nowadays.  A good text editor will let you choose your line break:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dhxKM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment363039> Where do you want this to be done - in Terminal, a text file or inside some programming language (Java, C#, C++, etc.) ?? <comment363062> @ReneLarsen: Setting: either Terminal or a text file. Getting: Terminal. <comment363063> Thanks. Out of curiosity: what text editor did you take the screenshot from? <comment363165> This one seems to be from TextWrangler - there is a similar setting in TextMate <comment363168> Here are some options for displaying the line feed character(s): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569997/view-line-endings-in-a-text-file <comment363171> @ReneLarsen: I explicitly mentioned *system-wide* in the title as well as in the body of my question to emphasize that I am *not* interested in the settings pertaining to a particular file or application, which is what the post you linked to addresses. <comment363185> Well system-wide macOS is using CR, and can not be changed - you can however change the newline character(s) used in various editors to use Unix or Windows/DOS newline character(s). In the link there are some ways to see which character(s) a file has - and then if it is what one want - convert from dos 2 unix or from unix 2 dos (which then changes the newline character(s))
