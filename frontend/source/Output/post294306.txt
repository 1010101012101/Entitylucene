Finder Freezes After Navigating to Specific Folder <body> So to preface, I'm using a mid-2013 MacBook Air, macOS 10.13 Public Beta, and a 4 TB Western Digital External Hard Drive formatted as APFS Encrypted (Same as internal SSD).  Now, I realize the problem may be that I'm using the beta, or APFS, or a combination of the two. However, I do not have the chance to test it out on another computer or OS right now without downgrading to 10.12, testing it, then going back up to 13. Especially since I have the external hard drive formatted as APFS and I'd probably have to reformat that as well which would just negate the entire reason of going back. With that aside, let me explain what actually happens. So in my external hard drive I have all my files organized in a very nice folder structure (4-5 folders deep to get to the files in question). In Finder, I can navigate through any folder I want, however once I get through the last one where it displays my movies/TV shows, it completely freezes and I have to Relaunch it. Now I have other files in the hard drive (other applications and whatnot), but it doesn't freeze going to those. Only the movies/TV shows final folders.  Prior to me writing this, I tested it in Terminal to see if it was just Finder being buggy. Using just the codecd "folder&gt;folder"/code commands, it would freeze at the final folder just like I described in the Finder section. However I just tested it to get a screenshot to show you and it worked just fine... To get it to work before I used the codemv "file" "folder"/code command to get it to a different folder higher in the hierarchy and that worked.  So, is there any way to see what exactly Finder is hanging up on so I could possibly fix it? I can use Terminal which is a relief. I'm just trying to get an answer if there is one or if 10.13 is just being buggy in which case I can send up a report.
