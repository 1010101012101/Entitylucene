Is there a way to change the default camera app launched from the iOS5 lock screen? <body> In iOS 5 the lock screen can access the camera app.   Is there a way to change the default app that is launched. I would rather use instagram for its social media connections and filters.  <answer35922> Sorry, but Apple doesn't allow this, and it doesn't even look like there is a jailbreak tweak for this.  <answer36038> If you are runnning a jailbroken iOS5 device, AnyLockApp seems to be able to change the default app.  You will have to enter your passcode in order to use the app though.  <comment41013> Sadly, after more extensive research, you're right. <comment41094> Bummer...that would be a nice feature to have, but I don't see Apple doing anything official about it. <comment41130> no I am using iOS5 <comment41405> Did you read the description of the app? It only works for IOS5 or higher. <comment41406> No, I am running iOS5 not a Jailbroken device. <comment41409> iOS5 and a jailbroken device are not mutually exclusive. <comment41411> Having said that, I don't think there will ever be a way to change the app unless the overlords at Apple say so. <comment41412> correct, like I say, I am not going to Jailbreak my device. <comment41413> It wasn't clear in the question that this was going on a device that was not to be jailbroken, so I thought it was an appropriate answer. I'm just going to leave the answer here anyway. <comment41414> that's fine, as others may need it. <comment48822> This was perfect, thanks!  And Graeme, the only downside to jail breaking is having to do a little more work to upgrade each time.  It's great for this sort of thing.
