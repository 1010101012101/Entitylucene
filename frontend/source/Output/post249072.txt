IR remote doesn't work on system wake-up after El Capitan upgrade <body> I just upgraded my Mac mini to El Capitan and now after it wakes from sleep my remote (Harmony Ultimate) doesn't work.   In order to get it to work again I have to go into privacy settings and disable IR and then re-enable and it works - don't have to do any pairing or anything.  Is there anything I can do to resolve this without having to disable/re-enable IR every time?  <comment308826> Is there a question here? <comment308831> Clarified the question
