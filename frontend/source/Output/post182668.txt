Select the availability date for the first release of an iOS app <body> The first version of my iOS app got approved by Apple and is now in "Pending Developer Release" mode. I just set a "future release date" under iTunes Connect codePricing/code and got this message:       You have selected an Available Date in the future. This will remove   your currently live version from the App Store until the new date.   Changing Available Date affects all versions of the application, both   Ready For Sale and In Review.   Will the automatic release date work or do I need to release the app manually? (I read on Stackoverflow that it may not work for the first release of an app)  <answer182669> If you set a date for release it will be release on that day, otherwise it will be in pending release until you push the release button...
