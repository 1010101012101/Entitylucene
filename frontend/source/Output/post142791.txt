Bonjour (Printing service) run on Sleep <body> I currently use Bonjour for my home wireless printing. It works flawlessly, but I have one gripe with software. If my iMac (pc connected to the printer) goes to sleep, the wireless print stops. Is there anyway if the printing can work while the mac sleeps. I understand why Apple did this to conserve power, but my iMac is always connected to power, and running things on the background. Any help, greatly appreciated. :)  <answer142822> To keep wireless printing available, you need to stop your Mac from sleeping.  To disable sleep on Mac OS X:  ol liLaunch strongSystem Preferences.app/strong from the strongApplications/strong folder./li liSelect strongEnergy Saver/strong/li liMove the strongComputer sleep:/strong slider to far left./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CqYdI.png" alt="System Preferences"
