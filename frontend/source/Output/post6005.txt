iPhone app to download/upload files <body> How can I upload/download files from/on to a jailbroken iPhone 3G?  Are there any apps that allow me to do this?  <answer6010> Diskaid will let you manage the contents of the filesystem from your Computer.br iPhoneBrowser will as well, but the interface is much cruder. It is free, though (DiskAid is $10).br i-FunBox is another free option (though not open source). I have no experience with it.  On the iPhone, you can get SafariDownloadManager to download files. It's $5, unfortunately.  Once you've downloaded the files, it's likely you will need to move them to whatever application you want to consume them with, so a local filemanager is probably needed.  iFile is a really nice file manager, and is good for moving data files between apps (books, etc...). It's a few dollars, though.br I believe there are a few free filemanagers on cydia. I'm not familiar with them, though.  <answer6023> http://www.dropbox.com/iphoneapp  2 Gb free account. No jailbreak needed.br Uploaded files can be private or be made public (accessible via http link).  <answer6064> Install strongOpenSSH/strong on emCydia/em (remember to change from the default password somehow - can also be done through ssh of course) and use your favorite SSH client. Here's a little how to suggesting WinSCP. On Mac you can use ssh with emTerminal.app/em or even AFP directly with emFinder.app/em with Cydia's strongnetatalk/strong.
