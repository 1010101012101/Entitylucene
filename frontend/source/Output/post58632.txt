Enable ssh-key-only login to my Mac for 1 user <body> I have a Macbook Air that I would like to allow remote SSH access to without a password. I have created a user called coderemotepair/code that I have logged into and verified I can used the Mac with. I have also added this user to the "Remove Login" service's allowed user list and turned on the service. This was all done in the "Sharing" control panel.  I have gotten the public key of another computer and added it to the file code/Users/remotepair/.ssh/authorized_keys/code. When the other computer does codessh remotepair@&lt;my ip&gt;/code I still get a password prompt.  How do I disable this password prompt?  <answer58655> You should check the permissions of the directories involved: code/Users/remotepair//code and code/Users/remotepair/.ssh/code, they must not allow write access by "other" users. My code.ssh/code has access rights only for the owner.   Also, on the remote system, do a codessh -v remotepair@yoursystem/code to see which authorization methods are allowed and attempted. Lookout for  codeAuthentications that can continue: publickey,password,keyboard-interactive/code. Maybe you must enable codeRSAAuthentication/code on your system.   <answer58687> To disable password authentication you need to edit code/etc/sshd_config/code. In codeTerminal/code:  precodesudo vim /etc/sshd_config /code/pre  (or replace with your favourite editor)  Look for the line:  precode#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes /code/pre  And change it to:  precodeChallengeResponseAuthentication no /code/pre  That is, remove the code#/code at the beginning, and change codeyes/code to codeno/code.  All subsequent ssh logins will now emREQUIRE/em you to use an ssh key and will not prompt for a password. Ensure your ssh key works before doing this if you have no local access! There's no need to restart the ssh daemon or anything because it is started on demand for each new incoming connection. Note that you may also see a codePasswordAuthentication/code line, but that defaults to codeno/code already.  If your ssh keys aren't working then that's a separate issue really, but this answers the question as it is posed now :)  <answer269809> On a test system here, disabling the SSH prompt required the following two lines to be added to code/etc/sshd_config/code:  precodePasswordAuthentication no ChallengeResponseAuthentication no /code/pre  The comments in codesshd_config/code also advise the following line be added:  precodeUsePAM no /code/pre  <comment67486> I recommend adding "SSH Key-only authentication" to your question title--the way it reads now sounds like a regular GUI loginwindow login. <comment67623> I also need to add the user to the AllowUser setting. I can only guess the GUI setup didn't also modify this text line. <comment278082> Note, in later versions of Mac OS X (definitely in El Capitan), sshd_config has been moved to `/etc/ssh/`. <comment353166> Note, as of MacOS Sierra (v10.12.x), the default for `PasswordAuthentication` has changed to `yes`, so be sure to change it to `no`.
