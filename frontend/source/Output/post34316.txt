Unified Switching between Keyboard Layouts in Various OSs <body> I have a Mac with VMWare installed and run Windows- and Ubuntu-powered virtual machines there. The problem is that in each of the operating systems I have to use different keys to switch between keyboard layouts (English-German-Russian).  Does anybody know whether there is some way to unify the layout switching key combination in all the OSs? For instance switching the layouts using Apple/Windows key and Space Bar.  <answer34368> Yes, should be possible. You just need to unify your keyboard shortcuts in each OS.   For OS X it's in "System Preferences" â†’ "Keyboard"/"Keyboard Shortcuts" for Snowleopard it's in "Keyboard &amp; Text Input" on the left side and then you enter your desired shortcut by clicking on the assigned shortcut and pressing the combination you want.    Note that kbdcmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd is usually assigned to Spotlight search, so you would need to change that too.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wIi2E.png" alt="select_input_source"  And I think you know how to change it in Windows and Ubuntu, or you're able to find out - right ?
