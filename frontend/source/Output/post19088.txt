How do I get the iTunes play control widget back in Dashboard? <body> In OS X 10.7 Lion, the iTunes dashboard widget from 10.6 Snow Leopard is no longer on the dashboard, I can't find a method of adding it again, it doesn't appear to be listed.  I frequently used this to control play/pause and track forward back.  <answer19897> You can download it here.  <comment22114> Thank you for helping restore my instant access to itunes play functions! <comment22208> You're welcome, glad to be of service.
