How may I quit iPhoto without saving modifications? <body> I am working with a huge photo library and from time to time I experiment quick editing on some pictures. Sometimes I also make uncontrolled changes which apply on a set of pictures I can't correctly see.  In these situations I would like to be able to exit codeiPhoto/code without saving these unwanted modifications.  I didn't find any preference permetting to achieve strongthis wanted behaviour/strong. Hopefully I have this basic function on most applications which can modify files or libraries beyond what the user can see.  Is there any hidden codedefaults/code of codeiPhoto/code which would give access to such a simple function?  I am actually running codeiPhoto '11/code, but I'm interested by this function for any version running on Lion, Mountain Lion &amp; Mavericks.  <answer158122> iPhoto saves as you go [same as iMovie, Final Cut Pro etc] - but it always preserves the original file &amp; you can revert at any time...   From Photos menu  Revert to Original.  I don't know of any way to 'reset' in bulk if you have been working on multiple images.  <answer158128> From the menu at the top select "Photos  Revert to Original".  This also works if you select multiple photos/events.
