iPhoto '11 vs. iPhoto '09 keyboard shortcuts <body> In iPhoto '09 looking at a picture in an event, I could hit kbdEsc/kbd to get back to the event. It appears that this no longer works in iPhoto '11.  Is there a different keyboard shortcut that works?  <answer11616> After fiddling around a bit, it seems that kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2190;/kbd works.  <answer11617> All keyboard shortcuts can be found on Apple's iPhoto Keyboard Shortcuts website.  <comment12153> I disagree. The website you link to doesn't show the Cmd-LeftArrow combination and yet it works.
