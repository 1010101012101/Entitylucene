Exclude a mailbox from "All Inboxes" or compose a custom multiple inbox view <body> I have recently added my work mailbox to my iphone.   I have several other mailboxes that I use for non work purposes. I like to look at the mail from my non work mailboxes as though they were a single mailbox, so I use the "All Inboxes" option in the mail app.  I would like to exclude work emails from the "All Inboxes" view, is this possible? Failing that is there a way to create a view of my own that only includes my non work mailboxes?  I've had a look at Exclude mails from specific Inbox in “Inbox” view but nothing there fits my situation, and that's for mail.app anyway.  I can't see any way to create a multi inbox entry, is there a way?  <answer98527> Simple answer: no you cannot. But if you want, you could download other mail apps like "Mailbox" or "Mail Pilot".
