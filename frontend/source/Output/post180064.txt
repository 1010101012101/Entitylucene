Photos not going to iCloud from iPhone <body> My photos stopped going to the iCloud in February.  When I logged into iCloud.com, there is nothing after 2-28-15.  I went to the Apple Store, and the genius guys said "fascinating."  They checked all kinds of things, and couldn't solve it.  My phone is 2+ years old, and I am due for a new one.  Will a new phone solve this problem?  <answer180066> It's unlikely that adding another device to the mix will help.  Did the genius explain that AppleCare over the phone supports iCloud for issues like yours and mine?  If you have an iPad or can borrow one, you can test adding a new device to iCloud without needing to buy an iPhone.  <comment213792> The photos are all on my phone.  They have not gone to iCloud to show up on my iPad.  But, why are they not going to iCloud at all?  When I log into iCloud.com, they are not there.  I am due for a new phone, and wonder if there is a new operating system on it that will help. <comment213798> @Carole Possibly. IF you want to edit your details into the question, it might make it easier to answer without 20 questions or guesswork. Basically - the requirements are at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201317 and you might consider adding a screen shot of your device to show the iCloud settings for photos.
