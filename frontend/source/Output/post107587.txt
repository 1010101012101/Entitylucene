How to restrict Internet, not just web, access for the guest account? <body> How do we set up the strongguest account/strong so it strongrestricts Internet access to all applications and scripts in all ports/strong?  Using parental controls only restricts web access, and I'm looking how to prevent any application to access the Internet.  I'm looking for a strongfree/strong solution that works even if the (guest) user runs malicious scripts. USB access is required for the guest account.  In Ubuntu we can restrict user access with a command like this:  precodesudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p all -m owner --uid-owner example_user -j DROP /code/pre  <answer107607> strongPlease read this carefully and have another device with internet access, in case you are locking yourself out./strong  In OS X you will use the OpenBSD based tool codepf/code which stands for "packet filter".  ul liHelpful man pages are codeman pfctl/code and codeman pf.conf/code/li liYou need sudo access./li /ul  Edit code/etc/pf.conf/code to your desired needings:br An example pf.conf would be simple as this and look like this  precode## blocking rule block out user guest /code/pre  Now activate pfctl with codesudo pfctl -e/code and load your config withbr codesudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf/code.   For checking the syntax of the config file you can use codepfctl -nf /etc/pf.conf/code.br If you want to deactivate the firewall, pass the command codepfctl -d/code.  Testing the new configuration is as simple as codecurl -I apple.stackexchange.com/code. The firewall should block this for you.  However, I'd be careful with restrictions. If you are losing your Mac or it gets stolen, the guest account is the only account which one will be has access too(hopefully) which in return should have access to the internet to track it down(if "Find My Mac" is enabled).
