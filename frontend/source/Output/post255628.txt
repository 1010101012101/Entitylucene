External display goes blank for 0.5-3s after upgrading to Sierra <body> I have a 4k monitor connected via DisplayPort to a Macbook Pro 15" Mid 2015. It was working fine until i upgraded to Sierra this afternoon. Now the screen randomly goes black for 0.5-3 seconds at odd intervals: sometimes several times a minute, sometimes not for 10 minutes. I also sometimes see the lower half of the screen tearing horizontally.  Nothing obvious in the Console logs. I tried resetting the PRAM and SMC. Tried a different cable. Tried different resolutions. Activity monitor shows the graphics card is in High Perf mode and this does not change when the flicker occurs (though it may be within the sampling interval). System is on AC (not battery). Followed the advice here (External display randomly acquires and loses signal under Mavericks 10.9.4) and Verified the colour profiles.  What else can i try?   Update: plugging in a third displayport monitor seems to fix it. Might have been an issue with the graphics card switching modes?
