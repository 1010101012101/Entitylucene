iPhone 6 plus old backup overwritten <body> So - I had to restore my iPhone. By mistake I started to back up the iPhone, after restoring it (which did not restore it, it mostly just installed a new OS). I immediately cancelled the backup, but sure enough Apple's genius made the backup anyway, so that my old backup from a week before was overwritten.   Please do not give an answer how I "should have done it". I understand. A mistake was made, and to be honest I stoked that Apple made it so easy to overwrite the important backup, when it should have been obvious that I didn't intend to backup a newly installed phone with no additional stuff compared to a fresh install. Seems like bad coding to me.   Anyway: a new backup of my iPhone was made, overwriting the "real" backup from last week. By the way, why call it restore iPhone, when in reality it wasn't restored at all, only reinstalled? I'm mainly looking for the SMS-part of the old backup.      How do I do it?  <comment343751> Was that the only backup you had of your SMS messages?  Do you have another device with the same iCloud account that might have a copy of those messages?  If not, I don't think you can get it back. <comment343752> what you may try is, to open up iTunes and check 'Devices' in Settings. You could find older Backups there - if they are still on your drive... Reading your question already states that you did not use iCloud - what would have been a chance...? <comment343774> Do you have iCloud backups?
