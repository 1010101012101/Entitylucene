Flash Local Shared Object storage security issue? <body> I have encountered some strange behavior when navigating through the flash Local Shared Object folders on my computer running OS X version 10.11.5  The behavior is as follows:  ol liNavigate to the base local shared object storage codecd ~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player//code/li liNavigate through the shared object using the below path codecd \#SharedObjects/6MB4PXSB/skype.com//code/li liOn this path is another folder named "#ui"/li /ol  If I change the directory to the #ui folder it takes me back to home folder i.e. it is the equivalent of typing codecd ~/code  Listing the contents of parent folder shows the following:  precode&gt; ls -latr total 0 drwxr-xr-x  3 myuser  staff  102 Jun 17 12:07 .. drwxr-xr-x  3 myuser  staff  102 Jun 17 12:07 . drwxr-xr-x  3 myuser  staff  102 Jun 17 12:07 #ui /code/pre  I do not see any symbolic links from #ui to my home folder so I am not sure why this is happening.  I have tested this repeatedly and it consistently takes me to my home folder.  My questions are:  ol liIs this a security issue?/li liIs it safe for me to do an coderm -rf #SharedObject/code given the observed behavior?/li /ol  <answer243757> code#/code is used by the shell to indicate a comment. So if you type  precodecd #ui /code/pre  everything after the code#/code is ignored and you basically just execute codecd/code. To change into the directory, use one of  precodecd ./#ui cd \#ui /code/pre  instead.  The same applies if you want to remove it.  <comment300167> I'd open Disk Utility and run First Aid against the drive before doing anything else. See if it finds any problems with the filesystem structures. <comment300192> @AlistairMcMillan thanks for the suggestion.  I have already tried that and it finds nothing wrong with the drive. <comment300280> Did not think of that! Thank you! <comment354644> The cynic in me says that adobe used the `#` on purpose to try to make it difficult to delete the "Shared Object" aka cookies by stealth.  Is it just me?
