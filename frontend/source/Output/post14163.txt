How to configure Terminal to be "Putty-like" when it comes to copy-paste with mouse? <body> As a long time Putty user, I love how upon selecting a text it gets copied  into the buffer and upon right clicking it gets pasted back in.  Is there a way to configure Terminal to behave the same way?  <answer14165> Terminal is limited in its configurability but iTerm2 is a Terminal replacement that does what you ask and more. Including bookmarks for ssh sessions not unlike puTTY.  <answer21544> If you have a three-button mouse (e.g., the Apple Mighty Mouse scroll ball can act as a third button), Terminal will paste the current selection if you strongMiddle-Click/strong (just like X11 and xterm). It is the same as invoking the strongEdit  Paste Selection/strong command, which has the keyboard shortcut strongShift-Command-V/strong.  As of OS X 10.8, selecting text in a terminal copies the text to a pasteboard and strongPaste Selection/strong pastes the contents of this pasteboard (akin to X11’s PRIMARY). It now behaves very much like xterm under X11. As a result, strongPaste Selection/strong and strongMiddle-Click/strong are now available when there is no selection, pasting the same text until something else is selected, and the text persists when quitting/reopening Terminal. The pasteboard has the identifier codecom.apple.Terminal.selection/code and is available to other programs.  Also, you can drag-and-drop selected text to Paste it. You can of course drag to other terminal windows (or other applications), but you can also just drag a few pixels and then release to Paste into the current terminal.  <answer116407> Simply install http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/ which includes both these options in the preferences.  <answer163537> NO need to download anything. In Terminal do  ol liselect text to copy/li lito paste, click the middle button of the mouse /li /ol  I just tried in Yosemite.  <answer250566> shift-⌘-V works on El Capitan. Feel free to edit if you have information about earlier releases  <comment15270> Looks interesting. How to you set cut and paste up as i described though? I don't see this under Preferences <comment15271> Preferences windows - General tab. Make sure `Copy to clipboard on selection` is checked under the **Mouse** section. <comment15274> iTerm is the best. +1 <comment15296> @Ian That will copy to the clipboard when text is hilighted, but won't paste on a right click.  It brings up the context menu.  It doesn't look like there is an option to do this, but it seems useful. <comment15306> @KeithB: What's a "right click"? :) But seriously, there's an option to make the middle button paste from clipboard. It's just down from the copy-on-select option. <comment15307> I use a macbook and a magic trackpad on my desktop.  No middle button, no right button.  I do have my trackpad setup to do a right click when I tap with two fingers.  I don't know of any way to easily do a middle click on a track pad.  However, I sent the iTerm developer some email, and this was added to the desired feature list.  Hopefully it will get added sometime soon. <comment15310> Install BetterTouchTool and you can map more gestures than OS X lets you map by default. I have four finger tap mapped to middle click. <comment154139> 2 KeithB: in iTerm2 go to "Options - General - install test-release updates (or something like this)", check for updates, install last test-release (1.0.0.20130622 by now) and get new option "Right button single click - Paste from Selection" in Options - General - Pointer. I spend half an hour after migrating to new Mac finding this :) Good luck! <comment196171> I like that feature, too - but ⌘-C ⌘-V is pretty quick :) <comment206785> Whatttt how did I just discover this?! Works on mtn lion too
