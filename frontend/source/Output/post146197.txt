iPhone Fingerprint sensor for passwords <body> Is there any way I could setup the fingerprint I'd to work in place of typing in my iCloud password whenever prompted, or perhaps even other passwords in keychain?  I had to upgrade to a 5s yesterday and as is the fingerprint id thing seems pretty useless if I can't set it up as a replacement for passwords.  <answer146199> If your device is jailbroken, you can install strongiTouchSecure/strong which lets you use the Touch ID feature for any password entry area in any app, including iCloud password dialogs.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dLXYI.jpg" width="200"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yim42.jpg" width="200"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3UMwh.jpg" width="200"   <comment172307> That's exactly what I wanted.  I'm curious why Apple wouldn't build it for that purpose to begin with?
