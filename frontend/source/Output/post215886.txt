Using gnuplot terminal on OSX <body> I just installed stronggnuplot/strong and I am trying to set the default terminal view.  On the wikipedia page for gnuplot, there is an image with a graph:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SVMPk.png" alt="enter image description here"   Which terminal view is shown in the image at the link?  <answer215887> Your image looks more like codeqt/code than X11, so you could reinstall gnu plot to call the qt graphics library:  precodebrew reinstall gnuplot --with-qt5 /code/pre  That's much simpler than getting XQuartz and X11 running since homebrew installs everything you need.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/biv1p.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you wanted to go X11 emfor reasons/em, then here is a nice tutorial and links to the visualization tools that should work on recent OS X versions.   ul lihttps://github.com/rdp/ruby_gnuplot/li /ul  It uses X11 for the visualization and should help you get your graph on.  ol licodehttp://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing//code Install the package that gets downloaded, then/li licodebrew rm gnuplot &amp;&amp; brew install gnuplot --with-x11/code/li /ol  Then start XQuartz, make a new xterm and run a script like this in the xterm window running codegnuplot/code:  precodeset terminal x11 set title "Some Math Functions" set xrange [-10:10] set yrange [-2:2] set zeroaxis plot (x/4)**2, sin(x), 1/x /code/pre  Skip the "set terminal" line if you are using qt as it gets set for you when gnuplot starts. If you need monochrome, you can also codeset terminal xterm/code.  <comment260973> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/103814/cant-plot-with-gnuplot-on-my-mac <comment260986> @patrix You rock - that's so cool `qt` works too. Re-evaluating X11 for this :-) <comment261037> Use `set terminal x11` if you want to get color output under X11 :-) <comment261096> @patrix Yay - I wondered why I was seeing monochrome. Chapeau! <comment322018> Note that ```--with-qt``` is deprecated and now you want ```--with-qt5```
