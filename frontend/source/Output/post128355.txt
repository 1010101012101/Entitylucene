It will automatically launch when you start Inkscape. Apple used to ship one called codeX11.app/code.  Now your best bet is XQuartz.  <answer128401> In the Inkspace download page, the instruction is very clear. You can download the X11 app from the link given in that page.After installation you can have the Preference window as shown in that page.  Direct link to the file http://xquartz.macosforge.org/downloads/SL/XQuartz-2.7.5.dmg  <comment150331> Do you have X11 installed on your Mac ? <comment150332> no how to install that? I am new to mac
