Why OneNote shows these weird characters? <body> Check this out - in Sublime (no hidden characters):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jzzYp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now in OneNote (a simple command + c / command + v):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z40wa.png" alt="enter image description here"  Since there isn't a Unicode option in OneNote, I don't know what to do. :-(  Do you guys have any idea on what to do? GAAAAHHHHH  (This is OneNote version 15.4 and Yosemite 10.10.1)
