How much more storage than iOS 7 does iOS 8 ACTUALLY use up? <body> I have read so many reports about iOS 8 installation storage requirements that I've lost count, and none of them even answer this very basic question.  “The download is 1.2 Gb… the free space requirement for the install is 5 Gb…” etc... But honestly, who cares? We get the space back after it’s done. It's a one time requirement.  What's ultimately of interest when I install iOS 8 on my iPhone 5 is: strongemhow much space will I never get back?/em/strong  <answer145801> When you complete the upgrade to iOS 8 on the iPhone 5 - you will have 27.35 GB of usable capacity out of 32 GB of "marketing" storage. If your phone is smaller or larger than 32 GB, approximately 4.6 GB will be reserved for overhead.  On iOS 7 - you probably lost 4.1 GB, so the loss would be 500 MB on the upgrade from 7 to 8 for a 32 GB device.
