Show categories in the sidebar of Outlook? <body> Is it possible to show Categories in the Navigation Pane (left sidebar) of Outlook 2011? If so, how?  <answer130453> You could create a Smart Folder for each of your categories to accomplish this.  In the search bar, search for "category:yourcategoryname" and hit enter.  The Search tab in the Ribbon will appear.  There, you can select "Save", which will save your search as a Smart Folder.  <comment152926> No, it's not possible.  s <comment152975> Ugh. Bummer. That's gonna be a pain as I have A LOT of categories. Thanks!
