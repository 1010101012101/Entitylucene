How to generate sound check data per album? <body> In Mastered for iTunes, Apple promises:      Sound Check can also correctly set the volume per album, rather than per song, allowing albums that rely on volume differences between tracks   However, my understanding is that codeafconvert/code (with the code--soundcheck-generate/code and code--soundcheck-read/code options) only works on track-level.  How can I generate soundcheck data from multiple files and apply it to a whole album?
