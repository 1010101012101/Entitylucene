How to generate a (valid) PDF with "a2ps foo.txt"? <body> I installed codea2ps/code on Mac OS X 10.10.4 via brew. My code~/.a2psrc/code contains codeOptions: --medium=Letter -P pdf/code. But when I do codea2ps foo.txt/code no PDF file is generated (this used to work on Ubuntu/Debian Linux). When I do codea2ps -o foo.pdf foo.txt/code I get a PDF, but it cannot be opened (maybe it is corrupted?). However, on codea2ps -o foo.pdf foo.txt/code I get a PS which I can then convert to PDF (and open). How can I make codea2ps foo.txt/code to produce a valid PDF on Mac OS X? Note that I'm looking specifically for the command line codea2ps/code, no GUI or other programs (obviously it's easy to generate a PDF from a text file with other tools)  <answer196799> The codea2ps/code utility is for formatting files for printing on a PostScript printer, hence its name is not codea2pdf/code.  The file you created under Linux (or OS X), which is a miss-named em.pdf/em file, is in fact a emPostScript/em file and many Linux Distros will open it anyway.  Thus leading you to believe is was a emPDF Document/em when in reality it's not.  Looking at the file created under Linux in a Hex Editor its header starts off with, e.g., code%!PS-Adobe-3.0/code and a emPDF Document/em starts with, e.g., code%PDF-1.6%/code.  This is why you get the "The file “filename.pdf” could not be opened. It may be damaged or use a file format that Preview doesn’t recognize." error message under OS X when trying to open a emPostScript Document/em with a miss-named emPDF Document/em extension.  strongUpdate: Installing a2pdf/strong  After doing a little research I found codea2pdf/code.  Further research required having Font::TTF::Font and PDF::API2 also installed.  So I downloaded all three packages master.zip (for a2pdf), Font-TTF-1.04.tar.gz and PDF-API2-2.023.tar.gz.  Next I extracted all three and installed them in the same manner in the following order, Font::TTF::Font, PDF::API2 then the master.zip (for a2pdf).  I did this in a Terminal using the following commands.  precode$ cd $target_directory $ perl Makefile.PL $ make $ sudo make install /code/pre  I then tested, from my Home Directory, with: codea2pdf filename.txt &gt; filename.pdf/code  It create emfilename.pdf/em and I then opened it in strongPreview/strong just fine as a emPDF Document/em.  That said, there are other modules that can be installed to do things like emsyntax highlighting/em, e.g. Perl::Tidy.  So you'll need to do a bit more research to utilize the full capabilities of codea2pdf/code.  Note: I have Xcode and Command Line Tools for Xcode installed and as long as you have Command Line Tools for Xcode installed, which is a Homebrew prerequisite, you can install all of this from the Terminal the old fashioned way if not available from Homebrew, which I do not believe it is.  <comment235169> Does `man a2ps` or `info a2ps` answer your question? <comment235184> @Marius Hofert, Please checkout my updated answer as I've added info for installing `a2pdf` which will create _PDF Documents_ from _Text Documents_ via the Command Line in Terminal. <comment235219> Thanks, that's very informative. I didn't know that Linux 'tricked' me here... <comment235220> @fd0 No, but user3439894 explanation helped.
