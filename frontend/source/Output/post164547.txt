Is there any way to encrypt content in clipboard? <body> Is there any way to encrypt content in clipboard to provide more security and protection from malicious software?  <answer164551> Once a keylogger/trojan/etc. managed to run on your systemï¼Œencrypting the clipboard techniques don't protect your system.
