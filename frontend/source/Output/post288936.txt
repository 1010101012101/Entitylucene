Enable syncing/indexing of Spotlight Comments in Finder on NAS <body> We have a networked NAS that is accessed by several computers via AFP. I want to know if it is possible to sync the Finder Comments across computers. The Finder Tags sync fine but the Comments, for some reason, do not.  I have indexed the NAS with codemdutil /Volumes/ScanNAS -i on/code but I'm not seeing the Comments across all computers. Should I have the this option set to codeoff/code instead? It didn't seem to make a difference when I tried.  Any ideas how to make this work?
