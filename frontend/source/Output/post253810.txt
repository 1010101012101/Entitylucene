Hide Siri's window on macOS Sierra <body> After asking Siri a question on macOS Sierra -- her response window just stays pinned in the upper right corner.  Is there a keyboard shortcut or another siri command to hide that window without having to click the small "x" button?  Maybe a way to make it automatically close after some time has passed?  <answer253814> You may close the Siri window at any time by pressing the codeESC/code key. However, I am unaware of a way to automatically close Siri after some time has passed.  <answer259860> the voice command is "exit siri" or "close siri". of course you first have to say "hey siri".  <answer260157> there is a workaround for that which actually works pretty awesome. i hope its ok to post the link:  http://www.macworld.com/article/3096187/macs/how-to-make-siri-activate-when-you-say-hey-siri-to-your-mac-running-macos-sierra.html  <answer264607> Another option (besides the codeesc/code key) is codecmd/code+code./code.  This is useful if you're on a MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, and you're in an app where the codeesc/code has turned into something else (like while playing full-screen video).  <comment325172> I thought Siri on macOS didn't support voice activation? Did this change? <comment325204> @Wowfunhappy [Hey Siri in macOS Sierra](https://georgegarside.com/blog/macos/hey-siri-sierra-macos/), but I guess they're confusing this question with iOS. <comment325582> Welcome to Ask Different!
