OSX DPI scaling <body> Windows has a feature that can make text and GUI objects larger by changing a DPI setting. This helps keeping the monitors native resolution, but still make text and objects larger on screen.   Is there a similar feature on OSX? I'd like things to be more readable but avoid blurring when choosing a different scaled resolution.  <answer237856> That's not possible until now. Apple tried to implement an resolution independent UI in the past but removed it when the first Retina Macs came out.  <answer239995> OS/X has high-DPI functionality too, but Apple seems to have decided to disable it for non-Apple display hardware.  A number of places around the web seem to claim that you can re-enable it with the command below, but this has not worked for me and my 4K TV.  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true /code/pre  <comment291548> Too bad. I think Microsoft really nailed this feature. It works really well and in Windows 10 mosts app react to the changes without a need to logout and login again.
