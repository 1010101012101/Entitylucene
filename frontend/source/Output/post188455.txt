Mac Not Saving Passphrase for SSH Keys <body> I have tried everything for my passphrase to be saved for my SSH keys so that when I restart, I don't have to run any "ssh-add" command.  I have tried:  ul liSaving my key in ~/.ssh/li liSaving my key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa (it is an RSA key)/li liMaking a profile for it in ~/.ssh/config/li liRunning "sudo ssh-key -k ~/.ssh/keyname" and "sudo ssh-key -K ~/.ssh/keyname" and those commands using the ~/.ssh/id_rsa directory whenever the key was in that place/li liProbably a few other things, but all I can remember at the moment/li /ul  <answer189876> I renamed the key to "id_rsa", instead of the actual name of the key, which I thought I had already tried, but after I did that, it worked.
