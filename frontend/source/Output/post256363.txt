Hot keys forcing Siri to open twice <body> About 30% of the time when pressing kbdCommand/kbd + kbdSpace/kbd for a fraction of a second too long, it causes emSiri/em to close and open again. This delays the process a significant amount that at times its required to be clicked just to even listen.br /br /emConsole: Errors &amp; Warnings/emimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lSXml.png" alt="enter image description here" It seems that the highlighted error is whats causing this. Im not too familiar with AppleScript, I did try codesudo killall/code for the associated processes but the issue is still persistent.
