Can I change my Podcast name without loosing my subscribers in iTunes? <body> I have a Podcast. I herd that if I change the Title of it I might loose my subscribers.   Is there a way to change my Podcast Title without loosing my subscribers in iTunes?  <answer198994> Making a change to the codetitle/code tag within your podcast's RSS feed will update the podcast title within iTunes, without losing subscribers. It may take a day or two for such a change take effect within iTunes.  hr strongNote:/strong The main concern is that making a title change to a podcast emwhere the feed is created for you automatically/em could strongempotentially/em/strong change the url for the feed which will stop the podcast from updating [...and an 'easy fix' for that could be resubmitting your podcast, which strongemwould/em/strong lose your subscribers!].  So http://example.com/oldTitle.rss emmight/em become http://example.com/newTitle.rss.  strongIf needed/strong, it's possible to update the feed URL within iTunes, without resubmitting your podcast or losing subscribers, as described by Apple in the 'Changing Your RSS Podcast Feed URL' section of their podcast specs:     You can move your podcast feed from one location to another. To avoid   losing subscribers, you must announce the change directly to all users   who are subscribed to your feed. To do so, you should:      – Use the code&lt;itunes:new-feed-url&gt;/code tag described in the iTunes RSS Tags   section below.      – Set your web server to return an HTTP 301 redirect   response when receiving a request for the old feed.      This will update   the iTunes Store with the new feed URL and your subscribers will   continue to receive new episodes automatically. Be sure to maintain   the code&lt;itunes:new-feed-url&gt;/code tag and the HTTP 301 redirect response for   at least 4 weeks to ensure that most subscribers have attempted to   download your most recent episode and have thereby received the new   URL.   <comment238302> Before we do research on this, what has your investigation turned up?
