Change input language in macOS Sierra beta when an external keyboard is connected/disconnected <body> Not sure if it is possible - is there a way to make macOS Sierra beta change the input language as soon as an external keyboard is connected? I have a Macbook Pro Retina 13" with an US keyboard layout, but sometimes I connect an external USB keyboard from Apple that has a German keyboard layout. While it is not difficult to manually switch between the two input languages, is there a way to automate this?  <answer248634> Karabiner can be set up to activate a different keyboard layout only for an external keyboard.  See  Different key-maps/bindings for in-built keyboard and Bluetooth keyboard  <comment308134> The OP states "MacOS" without any other designator and if it's actually "macOS", then Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment. <comment308135> What OS are you actually using? If you're using the Sierra beta it's "**macOS**" not "MacOS", otherwise it's "OS X" for versions 10.8 ~ 10.11 and "Mac OS X" for 10.7 and earlier. <comment308141> Changed it to macOS. I'm running the Sierra beta right now. <comment308142> That is unfortunate, however, I think there should be support for macOS some time soon? Still interested if there are alternative solutions. <comment308143> @snurden, While pqrs.org is probably testing Karabiner agains the macOS Sierra betas nonetheless I wouldn't necessarily expect a stable update until after the GM release of macOS Sierra. All one can do is to keep checking. :) <comment308145> @snurden I think Karabiner is your only hope for this.
