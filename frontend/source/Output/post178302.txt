Paste path into File Open/Save Dialog? <body> How do I paste a file path into a standard file open/save dialog?  I have googled this and found articles that say that the normal kbd&#8984; CMD/kbd-kbdV/kbd will work, however it does not work for me.   I'm running Mac OS 10.10.2 with minimal system customizations.  <answer178303> In your open/save window, press kbdCmd-Shift-G/kbd to open a window where you can paste the path.  This also works in Finder.  <comment211165> I can do cmd-shift-g in an open dialog and a dialog in a dialog pops up, "Go to the folder". I have a text field, but copy/paste keys are disabled and do not work. <comment211168> paste Works for me into the "Go to the folder:" field? What are you tring to copy?   In my test I was able to copy paste something like /Users/devuser <comment211177> @clay you cannot use ⌘+V to paste into dialog boxes, but if you right-click there is a paste in the popup menu. <comment211185> Thank you @Milliways. I can do right-click-Paste, but ⌘+V does not work as was said. <comment211193> @clay Obviously the information you found is wrong. the keyboard shortcuts do not work in system dialog boxes in any program. I find this mildly annoying in my own programs, but not so annoying that it is worth writing my own dialogs. <comment211194> That is weird. I am running OSX 10.9.5 and a am able to use ⌘+V in the dialog that pops up after I pressing ⌘+[shift]+[G].
