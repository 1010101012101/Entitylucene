Does iOS Contacts support storing profile pictures on Office 365? <body> I'm using Office 365 to keep my contacts in sync (iCloud isn't an option as I need Outlook support on desktops) and I would like to know whether iOS supports storing contact profile pictures on there.  I've had a contact with a picture on it, just restored my phone and the contact no longer has its picture. Did I do something wrong or does iOS just not support it?
