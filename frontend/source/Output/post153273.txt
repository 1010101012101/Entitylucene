External monitor displaying only noise after Yosemite upgrade <body> After upgrading to Yosemite, I see just noise on the external monitor,  using a MDP to HDMI converter and an HDMI to DVI cable. It worked very well on Mavericks. I have no display now after updating, it just shows grey noise. Tried resetting SMC &amp; PRAM. Additionally, I have tested each of the cables individually and they are okay, so it has to be a software problem.   Display screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pAieK.png" alt="This is what my display looks like"  It shows flickers in red color sometimes.  Macbook gives display on another setup, but flickers a lot. (my friend's)  its a MDP to VGA adapter plugged to VGA monitor.  Mine gives no display, I'm disappointed. Need help please.  <answer239386> It is also happening to me, and I can't find the solutions either. But I figured out stronghow to avoid it/strong.   strongWhen booting up mac/strong  ul liturn off monitor first and then power on the mac./li liturn on the monitor after the mac finished boot or in the login screen/li /ul  strongSettings/strong  ul liOpen system Preferences  Energy Saver/li liClick Power Adapter tab(assuming your mac is plugged in) and slide the em'Turn display off after'/em to at least 1 hr. /li /ul  It also occurs when mac goes to sleep and to avoid it, the steps above should be followed. Only do the strongsettings/strong step if you don't mind the power consumption.   Please let me know if you have better suggestions but this works for me as of now.  <comment180412> Does it show up in Display profiles in About this Mac and in ColorSync Utility app? <comment180523> You're not alone. https://discussions.apple.com/message/26885684 <comment182724> yes it does show up everywhere <comment196302> I have this same problem and have yet to find a solution.  MBAir 11" 2014, with Mavericks the external monitor via Thunderbolt to DVI worked fine, after upgrading to Yosemite I get the same thing as Usman...  My monitor works fine if connected on startup, but after sleep, or disconnect/reconnect, it goest to this noise display... annoying! <comment213628> Plugging the cable out and in again fixes it for me, but that can't be a permanent solution
