Export all stickies at once on OS X 10.8? <body> I am using Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8). I have a lot of stickies, but have been unable to find a simple way to export emall/em the stickies at once as either text or HTML.  Have I overlooked something obvious? What is the right way to export all stickies emin bulk/em into a more open file format?  <answer59531> h2Export stickies created by Stickies.app/h2  ol liInstall Notational Velocity (NV) and start the application/li liIn Finder open your codeLibrary/code folder and locate codeStickiesDatabase/code/li liDrag codeStickiesDatabase/code into the 'Filtered Note List' in the NV main window (see here for reference)/li liIn NV select any number of notes and choose codeExport/code from the menu/li /ol  If you prefer to write your own code, have a look at Learning Cocoa with Objective-C which explains how to reverse-engineer the codeStickiesDatabase/code format.  h2Export Dashboard stickies/h2  Run this in Terminal.app  precodeplutil -convert json -r -o - ~/Library/Preferences/widget-com.apple.widget.stickies.plist |     awk '$1 ~ /-data/ { start=index($0, ":")+3                         end=length($0)-2                         sticky=substr($0, start, end-start+1)                         gsub(/&lt;.?.?div&gt;/, "", sticky)                         gsub(/&lt;br&gt;/, "\n", sticky)                         print sticky                         print "---" }' &gt; ~/all-my-stickies.txt /code/pre  <answer125688> Below is a modified version of this script.

One is a Dashboard widget, the other one a "real" application. Which one are you talking about? <comment122620> This program worked great in Mountain Lion. Now I have to figure out how to import the files into Notes. Thanks, Jim
