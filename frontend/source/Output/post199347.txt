Userdictionary DB inconsistancy - how to repair / replace by default? <body> There is one item left in my OS X (Yosemite 10.10.4) system text substitutions list which can't be deleted. If you press the "-" button in System Preferences → Keyboard → Text nothing happens.  As is it stored in the userdictionary DB (and not in the .GlobalPreferences.plist any more) I would like repair the DB inconsistency or replace the db by the default version. In case of replacement I would like to know what kind of data will be lost in total.  Do you have an idea how to do this?  <comment239919> what "Item" are you talking about ? <comment239927> Sorry, I mean a line in the table where you enter the short and long form of the text which should be replaced, e.g. br - best regards <comment239935> I just tried it and using the (-) works! in the syst pref- keyboard- text table. maybe you have disk permission issue, try adding new one and then removing it. <comment239936> yes, that's what I mean. With "+" you can add snippets, with "-" delete them. Unfortunately there is one subs/replace text which can't be changed and deleted. <comment239938> I already tried a lot. I can add new ones and remove them, but this one is not changeable any more. <comment239940> did you try to repair disk permissions ? it is a small chance but it is worth trying. <comment239941> not yet, I will do and come back <comment239942> 20 mins remaining ;-) but there are already  a lot of permission errors :-0 <comment239943> Well, as said, it is worth doing that from time to time :), 20 minutes ????? mine takes 3 minute ! <comment239960> ok, check and repair done, but the problem is still the same <comment239966> AFIK, when system wont save your preferences settings it could be the global ones (disk) or User (you) ones called ACL.
