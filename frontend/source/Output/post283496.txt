"Disk Not Ejected Properly" after MBP went to sleep <body> I have an external HDD connected to my MBP (2016 model). Everytime the machine goes to sleep I get the "Disk Not Ejected Properly" message, which I find annoying. There doesn't seem to be a real problem. The drive is reconnected and accessible so it seems to be just annoying.  The questions are:  ol liIs this really just something annoying, or is there an actual problem with this?/li liHow can I make the notifications go away?/li /ol  The HDD is a "LaCie Porsche Design Mobile Drive - 1 TB"  I have seen this question: External hard disc not ejected properly - Mac OSX but it is rather old, blames the behavior on a special brand of hdd and also is about the drive not being usable, so I think my question is different.
