"Unable to move message" when deleting spam from the Apple Mail app <body> I'm trying to delete spam messages from the Apple Mail app in my iPad. The best way is to show it in screenshots:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHSdN.png" alt="enter image description here"  then  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3fxwu.png" alt="enter image description here"  but  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pROKz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea how to fix this?  PS. I tried this question at Apple support forum &amp; got absolutely nothing... they are utterly useless.
