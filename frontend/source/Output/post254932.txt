how do I delete a mail account in mac <body> I made an account I want to delete and cannot find out how. I have tried the "delete account" instructions however I cannot get it to receive my aol password. I have used the "go" and followed their instructions, however all I got was "unable"  <answer254934> Open Mail go to the menu Mail - Accounts....  Choose the Account that you want to delete and click below on the minus(-) button.  <comment317473> Your question is a little difficult to understand.  What is the 'go' you followed?  What system are you using and what OS?  What errors did you receive?  Please look at [ask] to see how to ask a question that has a good chance at being answered correctly.  - From Review
