Google on my iOS devices is stuck in a different region than I live in <body> For some reason, my browser always defaults to New Zealand. I've reset my location in the Store and in the settings, but it always pulls up google.co.nz when doing a search and the default map centers on New Zealand when I turn off my location.  Anyone know how I can set the region of the browser to match where I am?  <answer35886> I finally figured it out.  In SettingsGeneralInternational for some reason New Zealand was selected instead of United States. I had to close out safari, clear  browsing data and then re-search something from the iPad search bar and it finally worked.  <comment40022> Does this happen over 3G or WiFi or both? If it's only WiFi, is it possible that your network is configured to use a proxy? <comment40030> It's WiFi. My iPad is WiFi only. And i'm not using a proxy.
