Verizon iPhone 4 to iPhone 5 sim card difference <body> I'm with Verizon and have an iPhone 4 which has a micro-sim and I am getting an iPhone 5 which has a nano sim. How do I switch my cell number over to the iPhone 5. Is this something I can do online by purchasing a new sim card or do I need to go into a store?  <comment316663> If you're staying with Verizon for the purchase, they should be able to do either one, whichever is easiest for you.
