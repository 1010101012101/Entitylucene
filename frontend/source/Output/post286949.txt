Speedest Installation macOS Sierra from Thunderbolt, MacBook Air <body> My MacBook Air comes originally with strongEl Capitan/strong.  I call to Apple Support because emI want install a clean strongmacOS Sierra/em/strong, and they told me Hold kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd,  delete the Hard Disk, and next Select Reinstall.  By default the connection was strongWifi/strong. The problem, this connection is very slowly, I haven't option to select my thunderbold LAN connection, instead of Wifi.  The strongWifi/strong for me its vey problematic, and I need to reboot. Then appears world globe... After I delete my HD again, but Appears strongEl Capitan/strong.  The problem this methods needs 10 hours over a problematic wifi.  I think that I need to install strongEl Capitan/strong later upgrade to strongSierra/strong Later again repeat the procedure (delete HD &amp; Format) to perform a Clean installation of strongmacOS Sierra/strong.  strongIs there a Quickly method?/strong  strongIs recommended/strong kbdAlt/kbd strongover/strong kbdCommand/kbd+kbdR/kbd?  strongHow can I to select Thunderbolt LAN connection by default to install macOS?/strong  Note: I haven't runnable macOS now in My MacBook!  NOTE: I have a macOS Sierra installer on USB External Hard Disk (Original &amp; Modified), but I don't know how install directly from USB.  <answer286953> You can do a clean install easily:  ol liAttach the USB installer /li liReboot holding the Option key/li liHold on until you see the "install Mac OS Sierra" volume/li liChoose "Disk utility" in the Mac OS utilities screen/li liSelect you HD and erase it/li liFormat it in hfs+, usually with the name "Macintosh HD"/li liAnd finally choose "Install Mac OS"/li /ol  You may want to backup your data first.   <comment362196> I haven't USB exclusively with the macOS installer, I have my entire Backup 1TByte  with the original installer inside multiple folders... <comment362197> Then I suggest you find a running Mac to create a USB installer, it's the easiest solution. 'sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/USB --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app --nointeraction' <comment362213> You don't "select" your LAN connection. Just disable Wifi, and plug the computer into the LAN, and things should work.
