(in this case codebrew --prefix/code transforms into the directory where codehomebrew/code is installed).  For example, in a very simple case:  precodecd `echo '..'` /code/pre  Transforms into:  precodecd .. /code/pre  Which goes up a directory.  It looks like something is wrong with the git repo for your homebrew install. If you haven't installed a  lot, might be easier to just uninstall and reinstall and try again. You should go to the docs for brew, but you can just coderm -rf/code on your Cellar folder and have everything return to its original state.  More info here.  <comment61270> And that's why we should all use `$()` instead.
