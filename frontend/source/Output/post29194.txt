How to set a Reminder on iOS5 for a location AND date? <body> I'd like to set a Reminder on iOS5 for my iPhone 4 for when I leave work on Friday... However, the app seems to allow only location OR date/time notifications (or you can have both independently). Is there any way to get them to work in conjunction with one another as I'd like?  <answer29903> This is not currently possible. The Location and Time conditions are applied in a disjunctive manner.   <comment34321> Thanks for the answer. Do you have a source?
