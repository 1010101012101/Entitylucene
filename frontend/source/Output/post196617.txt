Are you able to interact with your screen?  <answer196633> Try this: https://discussions.apple.com/message/21852561#21852561     PLfrompasadena      Jul 31, 2014 9:35 PM    strongRe: Is there a way to unlock an iphone with a non-responsive touch screen?/strong in response to Princesscheena I am posting this solution   hoping that it will help others.   My son dropped his iPhone5C and the   screen is cracked.  One small area still works, but he couldn't enter   his passcode and therefore couldn't sync with iTunes to backup the   iPhone before giving it to someone to repair.   I searched online and   most people said it couldn't be done. However, in this particular   situation I was able to log in.  Essentially, I was able to turn on   the VoiceOver mode and that allowed me to use the small area of the   screen that still functioned. In VoiceOver mode, you swipe left/right   to highlight different keys on the screen that can be selected by   double-tapping.  Step by step, this is what I did:      ul   liHold Home key to turn on Siri, told Siri to 'Turn on VoiceOver'/li   liPress Home key to get to main unlock screen/li   liSwipe right/left until 'Slide to Unlock' is selected/li   liDouble tap Now the passcode page comes up/li   liSwipe right/left to highlight the correct keys on the keyboard and double tap to 'enter' each one./li   liSwipe to highlight enter/done and double tap to submit the passcode. Once the iPhone was unlocked, the first thing I did was backup the   phone and download all the photos.   Hope this helps people.   Phil/li   /ul   Hope that works for you.   <comment234908> do you have itunes on that windows laptop <comment234922> @Buscarì›ƒSD I think that Apple has gone to where you have to enter in the unlock code in order to backup, update, etc. with iTunes if the device was powered down. Even with iTunes, they would likely need to be able to somehow enter the unlock
