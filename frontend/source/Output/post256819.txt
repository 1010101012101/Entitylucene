How can I remap `CAPS` to `ESC` while using multiple keyboards? <body> I'd like to have CAPS mapped to ESC, mostly for CLI usage. Before Sierra I had this working by editing the corresponding code.plist/code file. However since the Sierra update this stopped working.  I'd like to keep installed apps to a minimum but I did try installing Karabiner Elements which remapped the keys the way I wanted but at the same time remapped all the codeF/code keys on my external Microsoft keyboard to media keys (volume, brightness, etc).  What I would like is some way to keep things exactly as they are, so I don't have to remap all my codeF/code keys on the external keyboard, and just remap CAPS. It would be best if I didn't have to install additional applications (I'm already using BetterTouchTool if that helps) but I will if there's no better alternative.
