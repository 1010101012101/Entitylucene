Problem with Livestreamer after updating Python to 3.4 <body> After upgrading to Python 3.4 i get this message when trying to use livestreamer:  precode/usr/local/bin/livestreamer: line 3: __requires__: command not found /usr/local/bin/livestreamer: line 4: import: command not found from: can't read /var/mail/pkg_resources /usr/local/bin/livestreamer: line 7: syntax error near unexpected token `newline' /usr/local/bin/livestreamer: line 7: `sys.exit(' /code/pre  /usr/bin/livstreamer starts  precode#!/usr/bin/python  # EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT:    'livestreamer==1.12.2','console_scripts','livestreamer'  requires = 'livestreamer==1.12.2'  import sys /code/pre  Usually I would type "livestreamer [twitch.tv link] best" to run it  I can't figure out what I should do. I have googled for quite a while. I used this guide to update  <comment225565> How are you running live streamer? and what are the first 4 lines of /usr/local/bin/livestreamer <comment225591> @Mark When i open livestreamer:  #!/usr/bin/python   # EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT:   'livestreamer==1.12.2','console_scripts','livestreamer'   __requires__ = 'livestreamer==1.12.2'   import sys    Not sure how i am "running" livestreamer. Usually I would type "livestreamer [twitch.tv link] best" in Terminal I'm sorry if I am not clear <comment225592> I have some problems formatting here with linebreaks. So line 1 is #!usr/bin etc, 2 is # EASY-INSTALL, 3 is requires = (requires has two underscores before and after), 4 is import sys. <comment225596> From the code you have not changed python to 3.4 - /usr/bin/python will be Apples system python 2.7 (can you check this and show what running  /usr/bin/python shows) Ah I looked at the guide. Oh well you have corrupted Apple's system I would reinstall OS and ask why you want python 3.4? <comment225599> @Mark Oh no. I thought I might have to reinstall :/. I updated because I got an error message about SSL Connections whenever I ran Livestreamer. In the error msg it said that newer versions of Python would correct this. Thank you very much for your help, I am grateful. <comment225600> I think you did something wrong in the steps from the guide (e.g.  /usr/bin/python has gone wrong) + also python code is either for version 2 or 3 not both so you would need another livestreamer
