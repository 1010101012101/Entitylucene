Space missing on external harddrive <body> I was looking at my 2 TB external drive and it said in the finder that 1.68 TB is in use.  If I look at the folders on my disk I see just under 1 TB in use.  I have checked this with finder, Disk Inventory and DiskWave (see below).   If I go into the terminal and check the diskspace with df -h it shows as well that 1.68TB is in use:  precodeMichaels-MacBook-Air-2:Seagate Backup Plus Drive Mike$ df -h Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity    iused     ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk1     112Gi  103Gi  8.7Gi    93%   27047201   2276033   92%   / devfs          186Ki  186Ki    0Bi   100%        644         0  100%   /dev map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%          0         0  100%   /net map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%          0         0  100%   /home /dev/disk2s1   1.8Ti  1.5Ti  300Gi    84% 18446744073394902348 314649268  100%   /Volumes/Seagate Backup Plus Drive /dev/disk3s1   119Gi   79Gi   40Gi    67%     646812    328468   66%   /Volumes/Untitled /dev/disk4s1   4.0Mi  2.1Mi  1.9Mi    53%        544       490   53%   /Volumes/DiskWave 0.4 /code/pre  Where's the missing 700 GB gone?  I have emptied the trash, but I could imagine I once deleted a huge folder and disconnected before emptying the trash.  Any help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/plYOT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment325035> Run a disk check to on the drive. If the discrepancy still exists, [reindex the volume](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716). Any luck? If not, it’s possible that there’s a large amount of space taken up by a “hidden" portion of the volume - use Terminal to enable visibility of hidden files/folders `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` followed by `killall Finder`.
