Which adapters serve video out from a first generation MacBook Air? <body> It is not a mini DisplayPort. I tried that and it doesn't fit.  As far as I can tell, Apple don't make them any more.  <answer77091> The first generation MacBook Airs were Micro-DVI  (According to Kyle Cronin.)  <comment88994> Is it mini-DVI? <comment89020> Hardware shopping topics are off topic on the main site - you could try in [chat] perhaps. <comment89036> Too bad. It must be a common problem amongst owners of the first generation MacBook Air, and the answer is probably true for quite long. I can see you point in principle, but it would really solve a very real problem for Apple users. <comment89038> @segiddins I'm fairly new to Mac. It might be a mini DVI. I looked at Wikipedia but couldn't really make head or tail of it. <comment89039> The first generation MacBook Airs were Micro-DVI. <comment89084> ah I was close!, kyle why not add that as the answer?
