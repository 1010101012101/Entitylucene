Recommend me a productivity/workflow tool <body> Can anyone recommend me a productivity/workflow tool that does the following?  ul liI would like it to be task based/li liI would like to be able to set: ul lia due-date/li lipriority/li listatus (for example: started, paused, waiting for input, finished, cancelled)/li /ul/li liI would like to be able to link directly to one or several emails in my email program (OSX mail program or thunderbird preferred)/li liI would like to write notes about each task/li liI would like to be able to add attachments (documents and images)/li liSome calendar integration would be nice /li /ul  <answer4803> I believe Things does all that. I use it. I like it.   I don’t know about thunderbird “linking” but with Mail.app it works. You can “drag” a mail onto a task or things to create a new one. Same with documents.   <answer4818> I think you're looking for OmniFocus, which does (if I recall) everything you want, has a system-wide modal "inbox" tool as well as synchronizable iPad and iPhone apps.  Their price point is ridiculously high in my opinion, but people are fanatical about it.  <answer4841> Maybe you want to take a look at Process (Manual in PDF). It’s cheaper than Things and OmniFocus.  substrongnote/strong: emI’m adding this 2nd answer so people can vote at their discretion./em /sub  <answer4844> The Hit List also does all this. I'm currently using it. It offers sub-tasks and sub-folders so it is more inline with OmniOutlier than Things (which does not offer sub-folders).  It's currently in Beta, which is nice because it's free.  <comment4739> Please don't post duplicate questions: http://superuser.com/questions/220608/recommend-me-a-productivity-workflow-tool <comment4741> @mankoff I can't close as a dupe of a question on a different site. Once we launch and there's a migration path, the questions could be migrated and merged, but until then it's OK to ask on both sites. <comment4797> Nice suggestions everyone. It'll be a while before I can pick a "winner" as I'll have to try the apps before I decide. <comment4801> Extra info - Licence is personal so you can use it on more than one computer. iPad and iPhone apps purchased separately, for now only one computer can sync with the iPad/iPhone version. <comment4987> that's like using a sledge hammer to hang a picture on a wall. <comment4988> @Epaga, I disagree. Nifle asked for "a productivity/workflow tool," rather than for a simple tasks list. OmniFocus is a productivity tool which *certainly may* be overkill for their needs, but that's for them to decide. OmniFocus sells themselves even for accomplishing household tasks (based on their "contexts"). <comment5032> i agree that it's a good recommendation since it's one of the standard programs out there. and i also agree it's ridiculously overpriced. ;)
