Homebrew vim already installed when brew update displays Vim as a updated formula <body> simple questions,   when I run codebrew update/code here is the result  precode[admin@mb125:~/src/test] : brew update Updated Homebrew from 16bd5c86 to 24073dc0. ==&gt; New Formulae mal4s  nbimg ==&gt; Updated Formulae aws-elasticbeanstalk   boost-bcp          ex-vi          libxml2            vim            youtube-dl /code/pre  Great there is an updated Vim, let's update it.  precode[admin@mb125:~/src/test] : brew upgrade vim Error: vim-7.4.052 already installed /code/pre  so, how do I see what has been updated for Vim and why I can't upgrade it?  thanks  <answer116149> Formula updates don't necessarily mean the software which formula installs is updated. So, running codebrew upgrade/code without other parameters will bring brews which are outdated up to date whereas running codebrew upgrade &lt;specific brew&gt;/code might produce an error in case it's only the formula and not the brew which has been updated.
