How can I throttle bandwidth for iTunes ony? <body> I saw a few questions asked and suggest Waterproof and a few other apps, but it seems to throttle everything outgoing on my Mac. I want to only throttle the download speed on iTunes. I normally use jDownloader to download things, and I am able to put a speed cap on my downloads, is there a way to do that for iTunes?  <answer36826> Try Throttled which should let you set a global or application specific speed limit
