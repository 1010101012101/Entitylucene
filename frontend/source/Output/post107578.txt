Memory terminology in Mavericks Activity Monitory <body> In Mavericks, the Activity Monitor has changed its memory terminology.  The columns available when viewing processes in the memory tab now include "Memory", "Real Memory", "Real Private Memory", "Real Shared Memory" and "Purgeable Memory".  I would have thought that since "Virtual Memory" has disappeared and "Memory" has appeared that they are equivalent, however that doesn't seem to add up because shouldn't then "Memory" be always greater than or equal to "Real Memory"?  (If I'm interpreting the terminology correctly, Real Memory is the number of pages currently resident in RAM, and Virtual memory is the number of pages total, including those swapped out to disk, compressed, etc....) However in Activity monitor, "Memory" is always emless than/em "Real Memory".  Can anyone explain what this mysterious "Memory" metric is?  <answer112502> For each process there is   ul liReal Memory em(always at least as big as Memory)/em ul liTotal Memory currently consumed by an application (including Virtual pages)/li /ul/li liMemory ul liMemory used in RAM/li /ul/li liPurgeable Memory ul liMemory which can be cleaned by MMU, if another process needs more real memory./li /ul/li /ul  Then, for the system in total  ul liPhysical Memory ul liThe amount of RAM installed./li /ul/li liMemory Used ul liThe amount of RAM being used and not immediately available./li /ul/li liVirtual Memory ul liThe amount of disk or flash drive space being used as virtual memory./li /ul/li liSwap Used ul liThe space on your drive being used to swap unused files to and from RAM./li /ul/li liApp Memory ul liThe amount of space being used by apps./li /ul/li liWired Memory ul liMemory that can’t be cached to disk, so it must stay in RAM.

For instance, that answer does not explain what the "Memory" column indicates. <comment131088> has things changed since question was asked.   Using latest Mavericks. And I do not follow your terminology? <comment132145> Do you have a source for this information that I can use to read abotu this more?  The part I find most confusing is that in your answer "Real Memory" seems to correspond to the "Virtual Memory" in basically any other OS.  Would it be accurate to state that your "Memory" is the "Real Memory" in most other OS's? <comment132300> It definitely looks like apple have chosen to "blurr the lines" by using uncommon memory terms such as real memory and memory. For all the "System" ones, i.e. the last 8 definitions, they are lifted straight from the Activity Monitor Help pages. The Top three are educated guesses and observation, based on what memory is in use, and some documentation on apple's dev center https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/CachingandPurgeableMemory.html <comment218744> What exactly does the number in the compressed memory column mean? If the activity monitor says a given process uses 621.4 MB of memory and 615.4 MB of compressed memory, does that mean that the process is really only using up 6 MB of memory? Or that 615.4 out of 621.4 MB was compressed down to some unspecified size? Or something else? <comment323917> On Sierra, at least, "Real Memory" can be significantly less than "Memory". https://i.imgur.com/RvAG9oWl.png <comment329186> @JamesKPolk From what I can tell, the "Compressed Memory" process column is pre-compression. "Memory" is then "Real Memory" + the post-compression size. E.g., right now my Finder has Memory 613M, Real 556M, Compressed 429M. 613-556=57M, which isn't reported in another column.  The system-wide "Compressed:" entry is, I think, the actual space used by all processes post-compression though. On my system, the top 3 process alone report over 3GB "Compressed", but the system reports only 1.36GB total.
