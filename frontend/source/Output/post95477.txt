How does Preview calculate to display PDF when I select View / Actual Size? <body> I switched from a Samsung 2493HM to a Crossover 2720MDP monitor. In testing, I opened PDF in OS X Preview (I am on Mountain Lion) and found that by default, the display size is very small, like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DiDCp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Notice that I chose View / Actual Size (command-0). Normally the Preview tries to render the page to sized like a piece of paper.   On this new monitor, a page renders to a size around 2 credit cards.   Where can I find the controls to get OS X to understand display pitch correctly and therefore allows Preview to view actual size correctly?   <answer95613> There is a setting in Preview  Preferences, in the Images tab which might be relevant:  Preview preferences, Images tab http://f.cl.ly/items/3m23193M2X0F2D0a1M3Y/Screen%20Shot%202013-07-04%20at%2019.58.50.png  <answer95941> I switched from a DVI-D dual link DVI input, to DisplayPort Input. The monitor supports HDMI, DVI, DP and analog inputs.   OS X was able to determine the screen DPI on DP. I open a PDF and choose View/Actual size, the size looks right now.     I do not know why DVI does not work. I can provide the codeioreg/code if anyone is interested to investigate further.   <comment112256> Nope, was targeting PDF. In that section in Preferences, Preview contains the same "define 100% as" selections, tried both, no luck. Bare in mind, things were working correctly before I switched my monitor. <comment112459> Ooops, sorry! OK, two more things come to mind: 1) have you viewed that exact PDF file on the first monitor? (Just checking the problem is specific to the monitor, not the file.) 2) I wonder if HiDPI mode is relevant... see [this Mac OS X hint](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110805141544753) for how to turn it on and off.
