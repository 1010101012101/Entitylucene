My Macbook's headphone jack stopped working, how do I fix it? <body> my headphone jack output stopped working a couple days ago. As in - when I jack a cable (or headphones) the sound comes via the built-in speakers.   On the installed Windows (Bootcamp) it works OK (sound coming out via headphones when jacked in).   Any ideas how I can troubleshoot this?   The OS is Lion, freshly updated (update after the problem first appeared).   <answer33431> (posted as an answer so you can accept it and mark this issue resolved)  Have you checked the Sound pref pane in System Preferences? There's a tab labeled "Output" where (I'd expect, as I don't have a portable in front of me just now) you can switch output between built-in speakers and the headphone jack. If the first toggle doesn't work, toggle it again.  <answer274485> The question is quite old now, but issue still remains on latest macOS (former OSX) version 10.12.4 Beta (16E163f).br/ One day I was using the headphones and the next day headphones jack port stopped working. Tried:  ul liReboot/li liSettings - Sound - "Use audio port for: Sound output"/li liSelect headphones instead of any other thing on "device for sound output"/li liReset NVRAM (previous PRAM)/li liReset SMC/li /ul  Nothing worked, then I tried to reboot with headphones plugged in, kind of worked, but if you unplug the headphones after rebooting, and then plug back in, it's not working anymore (it's kind of a workaround).  strikeSOLUTION/strike:br/  Shut Down - Start MacBook and press codeCMD+R/code (Recovery Mode) - Disk utility - Select boot disk - "First Aid" (both on the disk and the on the partition, did it also for the "Recover Disk Image", not sure if it helps) - Reboot.br/ br/ So far it's working fine.br/ Hope it solves your problem.br/br/ P.S.:What I was going to try next (not sure if it's possible) was to update/force reinstall audio drivers. br/br/ EDIT: It stopped working, and looks like it's not possible to reinstall audio drivers)br/ Workaround: Without the need to reboot or anything, just: plug headphones in - close the lid (sleep) - open the lid (wake)br/ Sound should now be coming out through the headphones.  <comment37544> Have you checked the Sound pref pane in System Preferences?

In any case thanks @bneely!
