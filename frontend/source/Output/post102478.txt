No responsive MacBook air <body> Tried starting in the morning after power drained, plugged in, everything came back for a few seconds then the screen went black. Can't restart. If I hold powe button down 10 sec machine emits an intermittent beep which continues until I push power button again. Any ideas on how to fix?    <answer102614> It sounds like your system is stuck in the completely empty battery mode (warning tone).  Try holding the cmd+r after you pushed the power button.  or  To completely reset it, remove power and disconnect the battery, then reinstall.  <comment120639> Have you tried letting it charge for a while? <comment120661> Unplug all except the power charger. <comment120698> Does the pattern of beeps match one of the [descriptions in this Apple document about "startup tones"](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5860?viewlocale=en_US)?
