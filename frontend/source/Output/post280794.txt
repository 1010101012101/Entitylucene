Why zooming in, then out, then in again without moving the mouse doesn't work on Safari? <body> If you pinch to zoom-in on safari, in any page, them zoom-out all way back, then lift your hand from trackpad, then attempt to zoom-in again, all without moving the trackpad, then the last zoom-in attempt won't work. Instead, you'll briefly see the scroll bar, but nothing will change.  Why?
