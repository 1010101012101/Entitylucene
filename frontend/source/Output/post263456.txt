Mac Thunderbolt Display not turning on <body> I have one of Apple's Thunderbolt Displays.  In the afternoon it took longer than usual for it to turn on when I plugged in the thunderbolt cable to my Macbook Pro (2015). However, the screen is not turning on anymore when I plug it into either of my 2 laptops.  It doesn't look like I can yank out the thunderbolt cord. I have confirmed that there is power because I can charge my phone through it.   How can I make the screen work again? Must I bring it to an Apple Store and pay for a replacement?
