Prevent Photos, iTunes, etc. opening when new device is connected <body> Sometimes it is necessary to use my mac to install apps being developed on to other people's iOS devices, meaning that it frequently has new iOS devices plugged in. Whenever I plug in a new device 2 things happen that I would like to avoid:  ol liThe Photos app opens, offering an import of their photos. This is obviously a potential privacy issue which I avoid by swiftly quitting the Photos app before it loads (thank goodness it's so slow!)/li liiTunes starts up (if it wasn't before) and offers the latest version of iOS (currently 8.4.1). This is pretty unuseful for me 2 reasons:  ul liI am not going to be updating someone else's device/li liSome of our test devices are purposefully kept some versions behind./li /ul/li /ol  I would like to prevent both of the above, and, if possible, still have wi-fi and USB syncing, but that's not required.  I realise this is a fairly common question, but I feel mine differs because:  ul liI have tried using RCDefaultApp to fix the issue/li liI have tried all the options using the Image Capture and iPhotos apps/li liNothing I find seems to cover the iTunes-offering-updates issue/li /ul  I have had this issue for as long as I can remember, but still have it on the latest version of the 10.11 beta.  <answer201620> The Photos problem could be solved by typing the following into a Terminal codedefaults write com.apple.Photos shouldAutoLaunch 0/code and codedefaults write com.apple.Photos canAutoLaunch 0/code  You can stop iTunes from opening by going to codeSystem Preferences&gt;Users &amp; Groups&gt;Login Items/code and remove iTunes Helper from the list.  <comment243070> The photos solution is required per-device, which means I need to wait for the app to open, untick the box, then close it, which is often enough time for some photos to load. This is the same for the iTunes solution provided. <comment243079> I believe this is the only way without using the command line. <comment243080> I am happy to use the command line. Do you know a solution that would use the command line? <comment243083> No, but I can find one relatively quickly <comment243340> Got hung up at the shore....working on it now.... <comment243345> let me work on Photos
