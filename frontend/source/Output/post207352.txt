Restore permissions on /usr? <body> Through a series of unfortunate events I managed to run:  precodesudo chown -R `whoami`:admin /usr /code/pre  on my 10.10.5 machine. This has left it in an awkward state. I can no longer codesudo/code commands as codesudo/code is no longer owned by root on the machine.  I tried booting in to single user mode and codechown/code'ing code/usr/code back to coderoot:wheel/code but code/usr/code is a read-only file system in single user mode.  Apart from a total reinstall of OS X on the machine, is there anything else I can do to get the permissions on code/usr/code back to coderoot:wheel/code?  <answer207353> Managed to make code//code writeable by running  precodemount -uw / /code/pre  in single-user mode and then I was able to repair the permissions with:  precodechown -R root:wheel /usr /code/pre  <comment250068> Did you try running `mount -u -w /` after booting to single user mode? Should remount the drive in read/write mode. <comment250069> And, if you chown'ed everything, can't you just run `chown root /usr/bin/sudo`? It's your file and directory after all currently :-) <comment250070> @patrix figured out the first bit just before you commented. :) Uh...I never thought to try the second suggestion. Myopic panic-induced tunnel vision as I screwed up my work laptop. :) <comment250071> Not sure whether it will work though, maybe the set-user-ID flag gets killed which is required for sudo to work. <comment250072> I'm not sure it would have worked either. I can't `chown` any other file I own to root. That seems slightly dangerous if it were possible. <comment250073> Ah, right, good point. Anyway, good for you to have your system back :-) <comment250076> So cool the system is sane enough to boot in single user mode and work. Recovery HD has terminal as well, but single user is faster when it works. <comment250085> Too bad SIP didn't have your back - this can't happen on 10.11 out of the box  <comment250095> @bmike I have other feelings about SIP. See site chat! :D
