How to stop sending texts to an email address <body> While my daughter was in Paris after the attacks last week, she was not receiving my texts messages. A red notification popped up next to the text asking if I wanted to send it to her email address instead. I said yes.  Now, my daughter is safe but all my messages to her are going to her email address.  How do I change it back so my text messages go to her text messages/imessage?  <comment262026> Welcome to Ask Different.  Could you edit this to explain what device you use to send messages? Mac and version or iOS and version. What specifically makes you say "messages are going to her email address" since it doesn't usually matter what your phone says/groups the conversation  if your daughter still is receiving the messages.
