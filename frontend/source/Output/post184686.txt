Can two iPhones share same backup space on cloud? <body> I have an iPhone 6+ and my girlfriend an iPhone 6. Can I backup her phone on my iCloud account? I have 200 gigs of space and would like to share backup space. Her phone is constantly displaying a message that her iPhone does not have sufficient space for backups.  <answer184687> strongYes/strong, you can backup as many devices as you have the ability to sign in to and have space for the backups in your iCloud, strongbut/strong iCloud Backup can only back up to the main iCloud account on a device.  <comment219001> 2 phones, one account… but would that work for 2 accounts? <comment219024> from the OP - "Can I backup her phone on my iCloud account?" I'd have said, not unless they both use the same account - which isn't clearly explained in the post, but makes me feel it's 2 accounts, not one. <comment219025> @Tetsujin Ah, ok—edited, thanks <comment219026> Cool - covers all the bases now. Thanks for your edit. Feel free to clear these comments if you think they're no longer required.
