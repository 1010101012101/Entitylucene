External hard drive disappeared <body> I’m currently suffering under my newly bought 6TB HDD. I safely ejected it yesterday and when I plugged it in again, nothing happened. I then checked DiskUtility but was presented with a strange thing: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v9Tga.png" alt="„Unformatiert“ reads as “unformatted”" Since nearly everything important to me resides on this drive now, I don’t really know if I could recover from this loss.  I’m on 10.12.5, running on a MacBook Pro late ’13, if that’s even important. Okay, I searched for a few things to do after that:  Output of codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            222.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP                28.0 GB    disk0s4  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +221.8 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  D1E19399-BC6F-4E9F-ADA5-D082A16EC2A3                                  Unlocked Encrypted  /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *6.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage MC-7                    6.0 TB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3 /code/pre  Output of codediskutil cs list/code:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (2 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group E7AF9022-948A-415E-9B5E-F288DD70F8E5 |   ========================================================= |   Name:         Macintosh HD |   Status:       Online |   Size:         222140432384 B (222.1 GB) |   Free Space:   0 B (0 B) |   | |   +-&lt;

I tried codefsck_hfs/code too, but got more or less the same results.  I’m quite depressed atm, I don’t know what to do anymore...  strongEdit/strong: The drive in question is indeed encrypted.   strongEdit 2/strong: I was able to recover parts of a few important files (~1GB of a ~250GB) using a recovery tool (on particular “Data Rescue 4”) on a drive which had the files before I moved them. I guess it’s worth a try when having such a problem, although you won’t get much results (but at least a few). Thanks for the help though. I’m leaving the drive as-is in case someone should come up with a solution.  <comment372158> If this data is really that important to you I would recommend you consulting a professional data recovery service. They can at least duplicate all data of the drive that is still readable before you/they "mess" with the original while trying to fix it. <comment372171> @klanomath: I edited the question. <comment372189> @klanomath: I tried hfsexplorer and MacDrive, both didn’t even recognize the drive <comment372190> @Kuro Something like this: [Recovering a non-readable disk on Mac OS X](https://nbalkota.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/recovering-a-non-readable-disk-on-mac-os-x/)  Comments  Shaheen Feb 20, 2017 @ 16:37:39 & nbalkota's reply. **Don't** execute `diskutil cs createVolume ...`! <comment372191> @klanomath I was on the exact same page yesterday. I’ve read the comment. <comment372192> @Kuro Please execute `sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/Users/username/Desktop/gpt.bin count=48 bs=512` (replace username by your short user name) and upload gpt.bin somewhere (pastebin/Dropbox/etc.) <comment372193> @klanomath Here’s the file: https://n.biyori.moe/MdTpuJRT <comment372194> @Kuro Now the 2nd one with `sudo dd if=/dev/disk2 of=/Users/username/Desktop/2ndgpt.bin skip=11721045128 count=40 bs=512` <comment372195> @klanomath okay, here: https://n.biyori.moe/p26hCbbT <comment372316> I guess I have to accept my misery. Maybe this is an opportunity for me to start over again, leaving quite a few digital memories behind. Fixing this issue is probably not even possible. <comment372599> @Kuro If you enable root, install TeamViewer and [wxHexEditor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxhexeditor/), change to root and invite me to a TeamViewer session I may have a closer look to your problem. <comment372612> @klanomath I’m not quite sure how to pm you since this site doesn’t even support that <comment372624> @Kuro Please send any questions or credentials to klanomath(at)googlemail.com.
