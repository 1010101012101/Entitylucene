Can't copy framework to the iPhone filesystem on iOS 10 <body> I am trying to copy RevealServer.framework to /System/Library/Frameworks using Filezilla (because openssh isn't compatible with ios 10).  But I get an error saying that the volume is read only.  I am trying to follow the steps given here.  Is there an easier way of using reveal on a physical iOS 10 device?  <comment347525> Dropbear is used for SSH on iOS 10. The reason it doesn't work with Filezilla is likely that FTP isn't set up correctly.
