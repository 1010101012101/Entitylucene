Command line developer tools missing after OSX update <body> I have noticed that every time I do Mac OSX update the codeCommand line developer tools/code is getting lost. I had to install it again after each OSX update. Is there a way to prevent this? Or Is there a way to automatically install it during OSX update?  <answer232091> They have fixed this on OSX El Capitan 10.11.4. I have just upgraded OSX and command line developer tools exists. I hope it will be fine on future updates too.
