In Terminal, can I find out the current Finder folder? <body> It is commonly asked how to get a Terminal prompt emfrom/em a Finder window.  I am asking the opposite.  I would like a command-line way of determining the working directory of the "current" Finder window.  <answer37771> codepwd/code: print name of current/working directory  codeopen ./code: open current directory in finder  <answer37772> The following command will return the path to the frontmost Finder window, if that's what you're looking for:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to get the POSIX path of (target of front window as alias)' /code/pre  Note that this cannot return a POSIX path if the frontmost window has no POSIX path. So if the frontmost Finder window has an ongoing/finished search, is a smart folder or other magical location (like your Mac under devices, which lists all the mounted volumes and the network).  Search/Smart folder/No Finder window returns:     execution error: Can’t make «class fvtg» of window 1 of application "Finder" into type alias. (-1700)   And trying to execute the command when viewing your Mac:     execution error: No result was returned from some part of this expression. (-2763)   <answer68875> This guy has a great answer http://coderwall.com/p/vp9zlw  Define the two functions:  precodefunction ff { osascript -e 'tell application "Finder"'\  -e "if (${1-1} &lt;= (count Finder windows)) then"\  -e "get POSIX path of (target of window ${1-1} as alias)"\  -e 'else' -e 'get POSIX path of (desktop as alias)'\  -e 'end if' -e 'end tell'; };\  function cdff { pushd "`ff $@`"; }; /code/pre  After that you can type codecdff/code to cd into Finder directory.  <answer68901> codeinsertion location/code is basically the target of Finder window 1 or desktop.  precodef() {     cd "$(osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" POSIX path of (insertion location as alias) end')" } /code/pre  There's a bug on 10.7 and 10.8 where the target and insertion location properties refer to the second frontmost window after opening a new window.  <answer76275> If you are using zsh with oh-my-zsh the requested functionality is provided by the osx-Plugin. After activating the plugin in the configuration file (usually code~/.zshrc/code) one can use  codepfd/code to geht the path to the current finder window and codecdf/code to cd to it.  <comment42857> I'm not really sure, if this is the answer to your question. Also, what do you by getting a "Terminal prompt from a Finder window"? <comment42858> I think you misread that one gentmatt. Edit: yup u realised.  I think he means things like 'prompt here' a service to open a terminal window from Finder where the path in Terminal is preset to the finder's path.  He's looking for the reverse function <comment42859> What do you mean by "current" Finder window when Terminal is the active app? By definition, no Finder window has focus then... <comment42860> and more what if Finder has several windows open - what is the current window? <comment43151> The actual opposite would probably be `open .` in Terminal... <comment47666> This is a good answer. I use TotalFinder in "visor" mode (it retracts when you're not using it). If TotalFinder is retracted and I run that command, I always get the error message. If TotalFinder is pinned, I get the path as desired. Shame it doesn't work in pinned mode; oh well. **Use case**: I wanted to write a command-line tool to create a new file (text, word, excel, ...) in the "current" Finder window, by which I mean most-recently-focused. I've done it a different way using DTerm to open a mini-prompt _from_ the Finder window. Works well. <comment80019> Hi there, I've improved the formatting for you.
