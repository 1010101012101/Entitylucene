iPhone App Store Stuck <body> My App Store on iPhone (iPhone 4S with iOS 5.1) is stuck, I already contacted the support from apple. But maybe there is someone here with a similar experience.  Whenever I open the App Store, it looks like the apps keep loading.br Here is a screenshot:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ozaVy.png" alt="screenshot"  After 30 minutes, it still looks the same.br It can't be a connection error since Safari is running smoothly.   I've tried to reset my iPhone to factory settings three times, but it still looks the same.  <answer46481> I would try disabling your cell phone connection (Settings  enable Airplane Mode), then enabling Wi-Fi, and connecting to another Wi-Fi hotspot (you could even try a public one such as a local coffee shop or an Apple store). Perhaps there is some kind of filtering going on with your Internet connection.  If you have a 3G plan, you could (and probably should) do the opposite too:  ol liSet strongAirplane Mode/strong to strongoff/strong (so that it uses your 3G connection)/li liTurn Wi-Fi off/li liTry accessing the App Store./li /ol  <comment53126> apologies, i forgot to mention if i still able to connect app store via iTunes from my mac. So i think this not from my ISP. And also already tried with 3G connection, still no result. <comment53129> @GusDeCooL: While it's probably similar, iTunes on the Mac is not necessarily the same thing as the App Store on the iPhone. I would try the Wi-Fi test above for good measure... especially if you can do it in an Apple Store and show them the problem! <comment53136> @GusDeCooL, since your iPhone's safari works fine, have you tried to restart your iPhone? If there's some system process that's "stuck", doing so might fix the issue. <comment53180> @JW8: He mentioned in the original post how he tried reseting to factory settings. I think it restarts it at least once each time you do so. <comment53181> I've had this happen recently and it seems to have cleared on its own. I just left the iPhone alone for a while and it cleared up. This isn't offered as a solution for you but it might be that the app store burps from time to time and needs a bit of time to get it's digestive system back in order. <comment53185> @Senseful, got it - hadn't needed to reset to factor settings and wasn't sure if a reboot was part of it.
