Cokies deleted when I close Chrome <body> I've noticed a really strange issue on Chrome on iPad today. When I force close codeGoogle Chrome/code it deletes all cookies saved on the device, I've tried logging in into multiple websites to check if it's not a website issue.   ul liI've tried uninstalling Chrome and rebooting the iPad and it didn't helped/li liAlso I've tried reproducing the same issue on a different device however on the other device everything is saved.  /li /ul  The only reason that this could be happening if there is an option for deleting cookies on close, however Chrome settings on iOS are really simple and I didn't find such option. Did someone noticed similar behavior?  ul lidevice: iPad 4 /li liiOS version: 7.1.1 /li liChrome version: 34.0.1874/li /ul  <comment151537> are you in "incognito" mode? <comment151633> does it do that only on force close ? <comment151706> I'm not in incognito and it only occurs on force close
