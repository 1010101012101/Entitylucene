How to prevent a "Bluetooth keyboard setup. There isn't a keyboard connected" message at startup <body> I am using a Mac mini. It does not have a keyboard or mouse attached to it. This is by design because I only want to connect remotely to it.  I notice that everytime I reboot my machine. The machine boot sequence gets stuck on a message "Bluetooth Keyboard Setup." There isn't a keyboard connected and it has a circling wheel which says "No keyboards have been found. Make sure your keyboard is discoverable".  I don't want this message. I want my Mac mini to boot fully to a state where someone can remotely connect to it without being blocked by this keyboard message.   strongHow can I do this?/strong   I have already disabled bluetooth on the Mac mini, but it still gets blocked at this screen when it boots.  <answer283067> strongYou have to turn off Bluetooth Assistant./strong  In emPreferences, Bluetooth/em, click the emAdvanced/em button, then uncheck "Open Bluetooth Assistant at Startup if no keyboard is detected."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6lqQm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Pv8Rm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Once you turn it off, you should have no problems booting in a headless configuration.
