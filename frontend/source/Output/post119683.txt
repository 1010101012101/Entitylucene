I removed /bin on my Mac, How can I restore it? <body> I removed the code/bin/code instead of code~/bin/code :(  My laptop no longer boots up! It has no DVD or CD drive!  How can I restore the OS X?  It is MacBook Pro OS X 10.8, SSD 128GB.  <comment139701> I did edit the accepted answer on the linked question - if you delete /bin - some common tools like `cp` will be missing, but you do still have `tar` and can `cd /; tar -cvf - /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/bin | tar -xf -`
