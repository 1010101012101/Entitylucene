Can't bookmark a page in Firefox <body> I haven't been able to bookmark a page using keyboard shortcut codecommand + D/code or star icon in the address bar for about a month.  At first, I assumed this shortcut might've been removed in upgrade to version 25.0.1, 26 or 27.0.1 but after going through their change log at codehttp://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases//code I couldn't find any of that.  Is there a way to troubleshoot this without losing my existing bookmarks?  <answer123593> I was able to resolve this by exporting the bookmarks as shown here: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer  (suggested by @dwightk )  Exporting my passwords using password export addon  http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-exporter   and then re-installing firefox.  <comment144028> Is the "Bookmark this Page" menu item greyed out under Bookmarks? Also, do you have bookmark syncing turned on? <comment144151> Nope, it's not greyed out. Bookmark sync is turned on. I tried resetting firefox, fixing bookmarks file as described here: http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/cant-add-change-or-save-bookmarks#w_fix-the-bookmarks-file, nothing worked. I made my bookmarks bar visible and tried to drag a link to it, didn't work. <comment144227> Can you follow these instructions and get your bookmarks backed up? https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer <comment144274> I was able to resolve this by exporting the bookmarks as you had suggested, exporting my passwords using password export addon https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/password-exporter/ and then re-installing firefox.
