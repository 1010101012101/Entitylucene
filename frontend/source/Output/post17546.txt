Mac Mini has loud fan, won't power up <body> My intel-based mac mini (Model A1283, EMC 2336) refuses to boot. When I plug it in, the fan spins up very loudly, but then nothing happens when I hit the power button. I don't get a boot chime, and the power light on the front doesn't turn on.  I've followed the directions here for resetting the SMC, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.  What are my options? Do I need to schlep it in for some applecare attention?  <answer17548> The best option would be to systematically go through the manufacturer steps for troubleshooting a mac mini that won't boot. Even if you don't see the power light - do run through the no video steps as well - it might save you a trip or a call with a tech.  Best of luck!  <comment19145> Sadly, I stepped through all of those as well. Looks like it's time to belly up to the genius bar. <comment19146> Indeed - the parts in them are fairly low cost as far as repairs go - hopefully it's ram or something else cheap :-) I'm hoping my mini lasts until a SSD + 1 TB Thunder Mini arrives on the scenes. (one can dream, no?) <comment19185> If it's a ram issue, you would hear some beeps when you try to turn it on! Have you tried resetting your PRAM? <comment19211> I don't believe the intel mac's use PRAM, do they? <comment19215> NVRAM is the correct term, however the command keys **option + command + P + R** used to reset NVRAM will likely keep PRAM on everyone's mind for quite a long time. <comment36249> My Mac Mini is having exactly the same issue, although it is booting up occasionally.
