How to view previous inputted MAC Address for WiFi network <body> I have a Belkin Router and accidentally changed the MAC Address for the Wireless Area Network. Is there a way to retrieve previous inputted MAC Address using Terminal?  I'm looking around system and network logs but I can't find previous records of MAC Address for my WiFi network.   <answer115780> I think by restarting your machine its MAC address will restore to its original value. If not you can get your hardcoded MAC address by executing this command in the terminal:  codenetworksetup -getmacaddress [your network interface, e.g. en1]/code  <answer115787> The information should be printed on a label located on your router. Find the one that corresponds to your wireless networking code(LAN/WLAN)/code. If you can't find it, you can follow the instructions here to reset your router to factory defaults:  Method 1:   precode1. Type http://192.168.2.1 in your browser, then restore factory defaults /code/pre   Method 2:   precode2. Hold the `Reset` button on the back/bottom/side of the unit pressed    for 10+ seconds, while the unit is powered on /code/pre   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fO300.png" alt="Belkin Router Sticker"     belkin reset instructions here   <comment135471> Which MAC address did you change and where? <comment135472> This command, as the standard `ifconfig en1`, will display the actual MAC address. <comment135515> If you would like your question to be of a great help to others, I advise you to make clearer which MAC address you changed (there are many MAC involved in the simplest network with a router and a Mac).
