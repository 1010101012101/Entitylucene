How to use same TestFlight invitation from different devices? <body> I want to test beta app with different devices, but when I open app from mail in TestFlight and try to start it refuse and shows "The invite has already been used". Any workaround?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEnoH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer294588> As Janos said,  In order to get an invitation code again, the hack is to remove that email account from being a tester and re-add him again. Apple will send him an email strongwith a new redeem code/strong.  Otherwise, Apple will send an email strongwithout a redeem code/strong.       <comment249966> You should just be able to log into the same account on both TestFlight apps. The apps should appear. <comment250171> Open Testflight.app on the second device. Connect-it to the same account as the one in the invitation. You should be able to download the app. <comment250189> revoked and invited myself again from beta testing, this is how it works
