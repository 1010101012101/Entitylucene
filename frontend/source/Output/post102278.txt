Can SteerMouse sensitivity be automated? <body> I have to adjust the cursor sensitivity in SteerMouse every time I switch between my home mouse and my work mouse. Is there a way to do this programmatically?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tJDCA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104670> You should check if SteerMouse supports applescript by opening applescript editor and then clicking File - Open Dictionary. If it does, please reply back.  In the meantime, there is a indirect solution, which is to have two separate preferences files for work and home and switching between them.  First, set your home settings. You'll find the preferences file at ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs. Copy that and rename the copy to SteerMouse_home.prefs. Then adjust them for work and copy those preferences and name them SteerMouse_work.prefs.   Then, in applescript editor, copy this code and save it as an application.  precodeproperty myLocation : ""  if myLocation is "" then     set myLocation to "Home" end if  if myLocation is "Home" then     do shell script "mv -f ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse_home.prefs ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs"     set myLocation to "Work"  else if myLocation is "Work" then     do shell script "mv -f ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse_work.prefs ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs"     set myLocation to "Home" end if  #You'll only need this part if the app needs to be restarted for the changes to occur. tell application "SteerMouse"     quit     activate end tell /code/pre  <answer105342> While @frediemathews answered the question, I wanted to post the code I ended up using.  SteerMouse saves its preferences instantly, so I adjusted the settings three times and copied the preference file each time. I have three AppleScripts which contain code like this:  precodetell application "SteerMouse Manager" to quit  do shell script "cp ~/Misc/steermouse-prefs/fast ~/Library/Preferences/SteerMouse.prefs"  tell application "SteerMouse Manager" to activate /code/pre  (SteerMouse Manager is an application which is hidden inside SteerMouse.app)  <comment123181> In short, move the prefs file and restart the app. Obviously! Thanks! :)
