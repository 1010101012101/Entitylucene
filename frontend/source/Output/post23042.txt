How do I get syntax highlighting of source code files within Quick Look back in Lion? <body> Source code files viewed using Quick Look on Snow Leopard had syntax highlighting. Unfortunately the syntax highlighting has disappeared on OS X Lion. Is there a way to get it back?  <answer23045> I don't think Snow Leopard did that by default, you most likely had a QuickLook plugin installed, such as qlcolorcode or colorqc2. You can simply install this again in Lion.  <answer23337> Actually, Xcode 3.x included a Quicklook plugin for source codes. With the intruduction of Xcode 4.x, such plugin has disappeared.   I have personallly tried to use qlcolorcode and colorqc2 on Lion, but both are not stable/reliable enough (slow response, sometimes missing quicklook). An updated version of the plugins would be welcome.  <answer24333> The Xcode 3 plugin was found at /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/SourceCode.qlgenerator Unfortunately I don't think this can be made to work now. :(  <answer27858> Guys you can do this procedure bellow:  To fix this, open a new Terminal window and enter these commands to open vim’s configuration file:  precode$ cd /usr/share/vim $ sudo vim vimrc /code/pre  Press the kbdi/kbd key to switch vim to Insertion Mode, then enter these lines below the codeset backspace=2/code line:  precodeset ai                  " auto indenting set history=100         " keep 100 lines of history set ruler               " show the cursor position syntax on               " syntax highlighting set hlsearch            " highlight the last searched term filetype plugin on      " use the file type plugins  " When editing a file, always jump to the last cursor position autocmd BufReadPost * \ if ! exists("g:leave_my_cursor_position_alone") | \ if line("'\"") &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; line ("'\"") &lt;= line("$") | \ exe "normal g'\"" | \ endif | \ endif /code/pre  Press the kbd⎋ esc/kbd key to take vim out of Insertion Mode, then press kbd:/kbd (colon) followed by kbdx/kbd to save the file and exit.  It worked for me thanks.  <comment25718> Can anybody with Snow Leopard confirm this? I honestly don't remember installing a Quick Look plugin to get syntax highlighting. <comment25724> I can confirm that there is no syntax highlighting done on Obj-C or python code viewed via Quick Look on Snow Leopard. You must have had a plugin installed. <comment31982> Sadly this has nothing to do with QuickLook, just Vim. <comment82634> I'll second that! <comment156925> tx, qlcolorcode is still working for me in 10.9
