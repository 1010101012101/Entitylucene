How to hide xattr lines from "ls -l" output <body> When I list files in the command line with "ls -l",  I get all the xattr lines also and this clutters the output, making it hard to find the files I want.  How can I list a directory without printing the xattr lines?  Here's an example of what I get when I type "ls -l"  precodedrwxrwxr-x@ 461 root    admin  -   15K Aug 31 19:54 bin/     com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B      com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B  drwxr-xr-x@  13 walter  admin  -  442B Jul 18 08:56 etc/     com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineNewestSnapshot    50B      com.apple.metadata:_kTimeMachineOldestSnapshot    50B   /code/pre  strongEdit:/strongbr I figured it out. See answer below.  <answer251394> The code~/.bashrc/code file had an alias that made that the default. I removed the alias and the extra lines were gone.   The line in my code.bashrc/code file read: codealias ls='ls -FGhO@/code.   Remove the "@" and problem is solved.  <comment312385> Please don't answer your question inline.
