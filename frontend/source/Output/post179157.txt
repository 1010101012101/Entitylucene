BootCamp wifi issues <body> I'm unable to connect to SOME wifi-networks when I'm booted into Windows 8 via BootCamp on my Mac. While the same very networks work just fine when I'm booted into OSX. I suspect this is a Windows driver issue (even thoough I do have the latest BootCamp software installed on my Mac Book 17" (2011).  <comment212339> Does Windows Update offer any updated wireless drivers? <comment212346> No, it says "the best driver is already installed" <comment212443> Odd. Windows should be able to connect to any network that OS X can access. You could try resetting the TCP/IP stack - click **Start  All Programs  Accessories**, right-click on **Command Prompt** and choose **Run as administrator**. At the command prompt type **netsh winsock reset catalog** and press Enter. Next type **netsh int ip reset reset.log** and press Enter. No guarantees but it's worth a go...
