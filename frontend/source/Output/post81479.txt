Terminal not logged in properly <body> I'm having a bit of an odd issue with my terminal.  I'm used to the prompt being codeJoosts-Macbook:~ Joost$/code or something of that nature, but all of a sudden it displays a number I don't recognise: coden041134:~ Joost$/code. I've added a screenshot of the Terminal below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZKYXi.png" alt="enter image description here"  It does not seem to properly start bash either, since I can't do code./script.sh/code to execute a script anymore - it requires me to type codebash script.sh/code fully.  I'm on Mountain Lion 10.8. I'm not aware of anything I may have done that has caused this. I noticed it when I was trying to execute a shell script that did some find and replacing using codesed/code, but it might have been like this earlier.  I tried the obvious fixes such as logging out and rebooting, but to no avail.  <answer82356> I was just told that this is in fact my host name, and by calling hostname the mystery was effectively solved. It turned out to be because I was connected to the university's network rather than my own, which changed my hostname.  The reason I couldn't properly execute shell scripts was an unrelated oddity. Apparently the permissions on the scripts I tried were not set properly. Coincidences made me link the two problems.  <comment93942> I was just told that this is in fact my host name, and by calling `hostname` the mystery was effectively solved. It turned out to be because I was connected to the university's network rather than my own, which changed my hostname.  The bash execution thing seems to be an unrelated coincidence.. <comment94967> You can answer your own question, which in this case seems appropriate. <comment95033> You're right. I hadn't figured out the bash issue at the time, but I have now.
