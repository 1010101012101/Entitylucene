MacBook Pro not responding to power button <body> My Mac wont start up even with full battery and charger plugged in... There is no sound, no screen or any disk movement.  The same thing also happened a few weeks back and when I took it to the repair guy; he fixed it in a matter of minutes.  He held down the power button for 10 seconds, removed the charger and did emsomething/em else and the system started working but I don't exactly remember what he did.  strongCan anyone tell me what those magic steps are?/strong  I am currently out of town and canâ€™t take it there again.  Any help please?  <answer111339> Maybe it was an SMC reset:     h2Resetting the SMC on portables with a battery you should not remove on your own/h2      Note: Portable computers that have a battery you should not remove on your own include MacBook Pro (Early 2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, and MacBook (Late 2009).      ol   liShut down the computer./li   liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li   liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li   liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li   liPress the power button to turn on the computer.  /li   liNote: The LED on the MagSafe power adapter may change states or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC./li   /ol
