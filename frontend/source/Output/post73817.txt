When I sync iTunes with my iPad, iTunes deletes all programs <body> My phone is not jailbraken and all apps in it is legal. I already authorized both my iTunes and iPad with one and the same account. I have the new iPad. I downloaded all apps via wi-fi. I transfered iPad purchases to iTunes (so, all iPad apps is in iTunes).  But when I'm trying to sync, iTunes show me in the occupied space bar that all my programs will be deleted during sync. And Confirm button appears.  Please help me to sync!
