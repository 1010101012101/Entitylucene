Lost audio on videos since last upgrade <body> I upgraded recently to Mac OS 10.12.4 and since then the Photos app will upload videos from my Kodak EasyShare camera WITHOUT AUDIO.  The videos show up fine, but they are all silent!  Even older videos transferred from iPhoto no longer have audio.  I tried using ImageCapture but the same thing happens.  Is there a solution you can suggest?  Thanks you.  <comment356572> Have the settings in [Audio MIDI Setup](https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/audio-midi-setup-your-macs-secret-sound-manager) or [System Preferences](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18958?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US) been changed? Any other new app installations that may interfere with audio output like [AirParrot 2](http://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/)? Try testing out audio from an app like [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) or [Youtube](https://youtu.be) to see if it's a systemwide issue.
