Is there a keyboard shortcut to move the position of a tab in Safari? <body> How do you move a tab's position amongst other tabs using the keyboard? Is it possible?  <answer237690> There does not appear to be a built-in keyboard shortcut to change the position of a given tab amongst other tabs in Safari.  At least none listed in the Apple Support Documents listed below.  ul liSafari 6/7 (Mavericks): Safari shortcuts/li liSafari 8 (Yosemite): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts/li liSafari 9 (El Capitan): Safari keyboard and other shortcuts/li /ul  One might be able to create an Automator Service with a Run Apple Script Action to manipulate tabs in a Safari windows and then assign it a keyboard shortcut in Keyboard System Preferences, however I'd imagine it might not be to easy to code.  strongUpdate:/strong  I looked through the Safari AppleScript Dictionary and played around with the coding of an AppleScript script to manipulated tab ordering, or I should say the appearance of tab ordering, as even a simple command such as codemove last tab to before first tab/code required a refresh of the URL. In other words whether or not I coded it via codemove/code or switching the URL of the current and next tab, etc, all methods I tried forces/requires a refresh of the URL, where dragging and dropping a tab only changes the tab order and does not refresh any tab when done in a DnD manner.  In conclusion, if you don't mind the tab URL being refreshed then the appearance of drag and drop can be accomplished however to physically move a tab without it refreshing would probably require the use of third-party utilities and much more complex coding then coding using codemove/code or swapping the URLs of adjacent tabs, etc.  <comment291238> I know of no method other than dragging it. <comment291300> I updated my answer, so you might want to review it again. <comment328054> Is this still true for Safari 10?
