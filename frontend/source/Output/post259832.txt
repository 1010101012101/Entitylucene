External hdd not detected or able to format on Mac with Parallels installed <body> I'm troubleshooting a new external hard drive.  It isn't readable on the computer it was bought for (my mother's).  It worked fine, at first, on my computer with OS X installed but she has Parallels and a leftover installation of Bootcamp.  When we setup Parallels she tried to remove Bootcamp but the removal failed so it's still sitting there as we left it.  I don't know if the failed removal is contributing to this problem (it's sitting on 300MB of unusable space).  On her Mac, the external drive doesn't show up in Finder (on Windows it isn't in Device Manager or Disk Management at all, even to show that it needs a driver or formatting), it only shows up under Disk Utility and then the indented subentry is greyed-out. It shows 0 bytes free but on my Mac it was not greyed out and shows its full 5TB are free.  I tried running Erase to reformat it  to MSDOS FAT (from Windows NT, that it came with) but that has failed.  In Disk Utility, the Info that seems relevant:  precodeWritable No Available Space (purgeable + free) 0 Purgeable space 0 Free space 0 Can be verified 0 Can be repaired 0 Bootable 0 /code/pre  Initially First Aid said:  precodeChecking prerequisites Checking the partition list Checking the partition map size Checking for an EFI system partition Problems were found with the partition map which might prevent booting Operation successful. /code/pre  When Erase failed:  precodeUnmounting disk Creating the partition map Waiting for partitions to activate Formatting disk3s2 as MS-DOS (FAT) with name S B+ 5TB Mounting Disk Could not mount disk3s2 after erase File system formatted failed. Operation failed... /code/pre  Now running First Aid:  precodeRepairing file system. ** /dev/rdisk3s2  Invalid BS_jmpBoot in boot block: 000000  File system check exit code is 8. Updating boot system partitions for the volume as required. File system verify or repair failed. Operation failed... /code/pre  I have tried plugging it into my Mac again and it has the same Info, but slightly different error when I ran Erase:  precodeUnmounting disk Erasing newfs_msdos: S B+ 5TB: bd volume name  Mounting disk Could not mount disk2s2 after erase File system formatter failed. Operation failedâ€¦ /code/pre  I realize the disk name of coderdisk3s2/code and codedisk2s2/code is only different because the two computers are naming it differently.  Also, codeS B+ 5TB/code is the shorthand for the name I was giving it: emSeagate Backup+ 5TB/em (their own troubleshooting page was helpful to a point).  <comment325140> Maximum volume size for FAT is 4TB. I'd have another go at formatting GUID/HFS+ or GUID/NTFS [depending on your Mac's toolkit, NTFS won't be available without Paragon NTFS or similar] The drive was probably MBR/NTFS initially, rather than GUID <comment325147> Ah, there's a basic fact I forgot. Thank you, that explains that part at least. <comment325153> Got it working now. I repartitioned the computer's main drive to remove Bootcamp and despite hanging and having to force quit, that seems to have worked. I had also tried booting into Recovery Mode, but it couldn't see the external hdd at all. Just tried GUID/NTFS which still wouldn't mount the drive, but GUID/HFS+ has done the trick (I didn't realise that was usable on Windows). Thanks again for your help.
