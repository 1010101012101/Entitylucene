OSX keyboard shortcut for 'show all' <body> How can I activate the 'Show all' or back button in a system preference dialog in OSX? E.g.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nnjYo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer110077> kbd⌘/kbd+kbdUP/kbd appears to do it, although that just raises further questions ...  <answer110079> In System Preferences, go to codeKeyboard/code, then codeShortcuts/code.  At the bottom you can enable or disable full keyboard access. Full keyboard access will enable highlighting checkboxes, buttons, etc.  When a control is highlighted, hitting space will have the same effect as clicking on the control.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9BemC.png" alt="Screen with highlighting of a button"  <answer110080> ⌘L, or View menu - Show All Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D6hI7.png" alt="System Prefs &gt; View menu"  <comment129699> Like in the Finder to go to the parent folder. <comment129736> Excellent! I cannot believe that's not the default (or that I was stupid enough to miss it - I'm sure I've enabled that before, pre-Mavericks ...)
