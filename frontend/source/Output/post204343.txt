Dragon Dictate pressing space bar when not recognizing command <body> I'm using yosemite 10.10.5 with Dragon Dictate 4 and 5 I had this problem. Whenever I say a word that is not a command the what appears to be space bar is pressed. In turn, paging down or opening folders depending on the application.  Because it happens outside the browser I assume it's a global command. Or lack thereof. I have went through every global command and have found nothing that could explain this. Another note this does not happen when I have a text field selected; like right now or in Microsoft Word when their cursor is flashing.  When I called the support team I really got no answer. He said that Dragon doesn't know what to do when I word that is not a command is spoken. But why would it press the space bar.  Knowing that Dragon is not going to help me with this problem is there a backdoor solution? Disabling Dragon from using certain keys? But this in turn could cause problems also.
