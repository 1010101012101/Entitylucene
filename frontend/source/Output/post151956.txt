Safari: How to show a loading indicator in tabs that are loading? <body> I've recently switched from Chrome back to Safari and i'm liking it so far. The only issue I have is that there is no way of telling if a non-active tab has finished loading.  In chrome tabs that are loading all have a spinner replacing the favicon displayed in the tab, you know that a background tab is done loading when the spinner disappears and the favicon shows. In safari 8 this isn't the case, tabs don't show favicons, nor spinners when loading. The only way to tell if a tab has finished loading is to switch to the tab in question and see if the progress bar in the address bar has disappeared.  Anyone know if it's possible to somehow show on a tab if it's loading or not?  <comment322808> It used to be there... Then Apple decided to "clean" and "simplify" the UI... it's really annoying..
