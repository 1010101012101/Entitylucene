how do I fix incorrect autocorrect in Safari? <body> Whenever I type my email into Safari, (Safari only) whether it's in a text field or filling out a form it misspells it and it's incredibly annoying. The weird thing is that it isn't even my whole email, its just part of it, that it wrongly autocorrects. I can't find anywhere where I've ever typed it in wrong. Any suggestions?  hr  When I type: "strongMyName@gmail.com/strong" it autocorrects to "strongMyNam@gmail/strong" before I can even type the "strong.com/strong"  hr  I have already tried to go to: strongSystem Pref.  Keyboard  Text/strong  br / as well as strongRight-Click  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar  "Learn"/strong br but neither have worked.  <comment259112> Sounds a bit like the system dictionary has accidentally learned the wrong spelling at some point. In other apps, you can right-click on the mis-spelled word and there's an "Unlearn Spelling" option. For some reason, this option doesn't appear in Safari, but if you type the mis-spelled version into another app -- e.g. TextEdit -- and right-click on it, does it appear then? (A bit of testing here suggests it might!) <comment259114> Alternatively, you can have a look at ~/Library/Spelling/LocalDictionary (it's a plain text file), and see if the mis-spelled version is in there. <comment259115> Type it in once correctly - backspace/delete the last letter then you will get the correct one in the list + the old one
