Powerline patched font not working on Terminal.app <body> I am on Mac OS X 10.10.2 (14C2513). I am using Inconsolata patched font from here. But I also tried to patch the font myself. The result is the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NmlUW.png" alt="Inconsolata"  I am able to see the glyphs but codezsh/code (see the glyph next to the branch name codedevelop/code for a git repository) and also codevim/code fail to display them on Terminal.app  Am I missing any configuration step?  h2Update/h2  Using Input Mono v1.100 I have the same problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NagV1.png" alt="Input Mono"  <answer178264> Let me suggest you to install Input Mono font, comes with full support to powerline.   In order the following to work, Input Mono font must be version 1.1. You can check the font version by going to codeFont Book → View → Show Font Info/code, and look at the version number.  With Terminal.app works out of the box. Just select the font and you are ready.  With iTerm2, you have to modify a couple of things:  ul liGo to Preferences → Profiles → Text and uncheck `Use a different font for non-ASCII text./li liJust above, click on codeChange Font/code and select Input Mono. Additionally you have to change codeCharacter Spacing → Vertical/code to 110%. Seems that Terminal and iTerm2 render character spacing in a different way./li /ul  <answer178907> For zsh:  I found that the theme I was using was defining the branch glyph in a wrong way. In particular, I corrected defining on my theme file the variable codeZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX=" %{$FG[075]%}&lt;glyph&gt; "/code where code&lt;glyph&gt;/code is the symbol you want to use to represent git branch.  For vim:  I found the solution in this question.     because 0x2B60 and the others do not exist anymore you just have to update autoload/Pl/Parser.vim to look something like this:   precode    \ 'fancy': {         \   'dividers': [ [0xe0b0], [0xe0b1], [0xe0b2], [0xe0b3] ]         \ , 'symbols' : {                 \   'BRANCH': [0xe0a0]                 \ , 'RO'    : [0xe0a4]                 \ , 'FT'    : [0xe0a2, 0xe0a3]                 \ , 'LINE'  : [0xe0a1]         \ },     \ } /code/pre  <comment211121> Is it possible some apps will not display private use area codepoints? <comment211131> I updated my question with Input Mono, thanks.. <comment211205> Really strange, in my case just works out of the box. <comment211306> Hi, how can I test it? <comment211323> Try the font in a different app <comment211328> I tried also ITerm2 but same results. In case I will post also screenshots. <comment333884> +1 for iTerm2 explanation - worked on OSX Sierra like a charm
