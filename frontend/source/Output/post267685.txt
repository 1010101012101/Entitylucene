Repeatedly "try to add a new helper tool" on each restart for same application(s) <body> Every time I restart my computer, it tries to "add a new helper tool" for instance I have to reinstall shell commands in Atom on every restart, and it prompts with the "An update is ready to install."  But I see this same issue with other programs too.  Atom installs code/usr/local/bin/atom/code -- but then when I restart it's gone.  I get the same thing from MAMP that it "wants to make changes".  And Slack gives me the same thing as Atom on every restart "An update is ready to install. Slack is trying to add a new helper too".  Let me know what other information I can give.  <answer271123> Try changing the ownership of Atom.app. In my case, Atom.app was found in /Applications, and ownership was:     drwxr-xr-x   3 1699963712  365896978    102 Dec  8 12:48 Atom.app   I ran the following command:     sudo chown -R $USER:wheel /Applications/Atom.app   In my case, any program with ownership of emroot/em or the numeric code listed above would have a popup a few seconds after opening. Changing ownership of the .app directory corrected the behavior and I don't see it anymore.  I found the information at this site.  <answer284058> Searching for the application and manually dragging it into the Applications folder also worked for me.  <comment363209> that makes sense, but unfortunately it wasn't my issue, the app was already in there
