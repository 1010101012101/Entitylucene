On iOS11, can I highlight PDFs and make notes with my finger? <body> I've seen a number of reviews that show the functionality of being able to highlight PDFs on iOS11 using the Apple Pencil, however, I'm wondering if I can do this with my finger on the normal (non-pro) iPad?  <answer295201> Yes. iOS 11 allows markup with finger of PDFâ€™s opened in the Files App or previewed. Works on iPad and iPhone.  No need for a pencil unless one needs finer control of drawing.   The example below is a markup of a webpage that was saved as a PDF using my finger.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WrHXO.jpg" alt="markup pdf iOS 11"
