What does this black bar represent in my iPod's Storage Capacity Indicator? <body> I was recently going through my (2nd Gen) iPod Touch's storage settings in the most recent version of iTunes and noticed that there is a small gray/black bar next to the "Other" storage section. I highly doubt that this is simply a drop shadow as other depictions of this graph do not feature such a bar.  strongWhat does this small bar represent?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2XcVG.png" alt="The black bar is outlined in red."  emNote: The small bar is outlined in red./em  <answer230915> To my belief, that indeed emis/em actually just a drop shadow. Since you're actually not on the newest version of iTunes, I can't verify that, since it looks different now, but here are a few photos:  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69jeU.png" alt="enter image description here"  iTunes 12 (latest version)  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IZsWH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Version that looks the same as yours also showing shadow  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kJEjo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Older version also displaying drop shadow  hr  With that said, I could still be wrong. Check and make sure it isn't any of these categories:  ul liAudio: Songs, audio podcasts, audiobooks, voice memos, and ringtones/li liVideo: Movies, music videos, and TV shows /li liPhotos: Camera Roll content, Photo Stream, and Photo Library/li liApps: Installed apps/li liBooks: iBooks books and PDF files /li liDocuments &amp; Data: Safari Offline Reading List, files created within apps, and app content like contacts, calendars, messages, and emails (and their attachments)/li liOther: Settings, Siri voices, system data, and cached files/li /ul  <comment281906> For what it's worth, I have over 4,000 notes on this iPod from different papers/assignments but otherwise, it is a fairly typical iPod.
