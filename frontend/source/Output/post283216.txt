Routing traffic back and forth through a Mac mini server with 2 network interfaces <body> I have my office network that looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5aujH.png" alt="networking scheme"  My office network looks like this:  ul lithe office network (wifi and wired) has the subnetwork code192.168.88.0/code./li liI have some server machines on the subnetwork code192.168.2.0/code (NODE_1,.... NODE_10)./li liI have a machine (it is a Mac mini) with 2 subnetwork interfaces that acts as:  ul lithe gateway for all machines in subnetwork  code192.168.2.0/code./li liexposes a VPN service (the Mac server app default one)/li liand provides extra services, such as a DNS) /li /ul/li /ul  The Mac mini configuration is my big problem. This is how it looks:   strongEthernet interface en0/strong  ul liaddress: code192.168.88.10/code/li linetmask: code255.255.255.0/code/li ligateway: code192.168.88.1/code/li /ul  strongEthernet interface en2/strong  ul liaddress: code192.168.2.1/code/li linetmask: code255.255.255.0/code/li ligateway: code192.168.88.10/code/li /ul  I need routing from machines in code192.168.88.0/code to those in code192.168.2.0/code.  To do so I have activated the strongem"Internet sharing"/em/strong feature of Mac OS: actually I do not know what happens under the hood, but the machines strongNODE_1/strong ...strongNODE_10/strong go to internet.  Then, when I'm connected to the office network, so that I get an IP such as: code192.168.88.33/code I add a routing rule such as:  precode sudo route -n add 192.168.2.0/24 -gateway 192.168.88.10 /code/pre  So far so good: everything works fine!!!!!  The big problem is when I connect through the VPN.  h2VPN Connection/h2  I connect successfully to the VPN exposed at: code192.168.88.10/code, then I add the routing rule.  precode sudo route -n add 192.168.2.0/24 -gateway 192.168.88.10 /code/pre  I'm not able to reach the machines in subnet code192.168.2.0/code.  Sniffing the packets I see that the packets follow the hops:  ol li- 192.168.88.10/li li- 192.168.2.1/li li- 192.168.2.110/li li&lt;- 192.168.2.1/li li&lt;- 192.168.88.1/li /ol  The packet goes to the gateway code192.168.88.1/code instead of the code192.168.88.10/code. Looking into the Mac mini routing tables I see:  precode192.168.88.202     192.168.88.10      UH              2       93    ppp1 192.168.88.202     40:6c:8f:3:d5:e7   UHLS2           0        0     en0 /code/pre  code40:6c:8f:3:d5:e7/code is the mac address of code192.168.88.1/code.  I would like to change the routing without using the stronginternet sharing/strong in order to allow internet access for code192.168.2.0/code, and cover both the VPN and local scenario, but I don't know the steps I need to do, and how to hand write the rules.  Thanks a lot.  <answer283259> It should be possible to create a bridge with en0 and en2 and enable net.inet.ip.forwarding to get rid of all routing problems. The bridge acts more or less as another switch between en0 and en2.   hr  ul liDisable Internet Sharing/li liremove the gateway in the en2 settings of the Mac mini and change the IP-address to an available one in 192.168.88.0/24 (e.g. 192.168.88.11)/li liremove all additional static routes/li liCheck for bridge interfaces with codeifconfig/code/li liOn the server create a file embridge/em:  precodesudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/ #only if the folder is missing sudo nano /usr/local/bin/bridge /code/pre  with the content  precode#!/bin/bash  sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 ifconfig bridge create ifconfig bridge0 addm en0 addm en2 up #use the first available bridge number here and the proper interface device names /code/pre/li lienter codesudo chmod +x nano /usr/local/bin/bridge/code/li liCreate a launch daemon emusr.bridge.plist/em:  precodesudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/usr.bridge.plist /code/pre  with the content  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;usr.bridge&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-c&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/bridge&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/tmp/usr.bridge.err&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/tmp/usr.bridge.out&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre/li liLoad the plist   precodesudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/usr.bridge.plist /code/pre/li liChange the IP-addresses of node_1 and node_10 to available ones in 192.168.88.0/24 (e.g. 192.168.88.101 and 192.168.88.110). Change their default gateways to 192.168.88.1 and the DNS server to 192.168.88.10./li /ul  <comment357056> 1. You have two default gateways: the one set for en2 is wrong - it should be nada/nothing. 2. You have a double-NAT: 1st is your ADSL router 2nd is your Mac mini en1en2 (internet Sharing!) 3. Is it possible to setup a static route on your ADSL router? 4. Please add your system/macOS server version. 5. How did you set up forwarding on your ADSL router (to get VPN working)? <comment357063> 3. unfortunately no 4. El Capitan 5. I opened the ports for the L2TP protocol and forwarded to the 192.168.88.10 machine. <comment357066> the router is the default vodafone one, the "vodafone station revolution". It should be the Huawei hhg2500. <comment357069> where do MacOs store the network ip tables, and configuration files? <comment357151> Thanks a lot for the long answer! actually I would prefer to keep the 192.168.2.0 separate from the 192.168.88.0. Would it be possible with a bridge? <comment357152> @JayZee This doesn't make much sense: you want to access everything from all devices but without Internet Sharing/NAT. Then you either have to create a lot of additional static routes (one route will fail because you apparently can't add static routes on your router) or you create such a bridge.
