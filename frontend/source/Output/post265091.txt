Mac OSX screen goes blank randomly <body> I have a Mac mini (late 2012) running OSX El Capitan with two monitors. Sometimes one of the monitors randomly goes blank for 1-2 seconds and then turns back on. This didn't happen when I used Mountain Lion on the same Mac.  I noticed that this problem occurs in summer more frequently than in winter. Probably it has something to do with the graphic card overheating.  Anyway, how can I fix this?
