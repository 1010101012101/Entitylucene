Adding music to an iphone from multiple computers <body> My iPhone is currently managed on my macbook, where I've added my music library from iTunes onto the phone.  However, I want to also be able to add music from my PC to the iPhone, without erasing the rest of my music. Whenever I try to do this, it threatens to delete the rest of my library.   How do I add music from multiple computers?  <answer28157> It seems that iTunes Home Sharing would fit the bill for what you're trying to do. Here's the link for the basic requirements. I've done this before myself to consolidate my music library from several different machines. Since you own both machines, you should have no problem sharing your library from your PC to your Mac, and then just syncing from your Mac. However, both machines are required to be using the same local network.  <comment32305> To my understanding, you can't.  You copy all of the music you want to your primary computer and load it to your iPhone from there.  This prevents you from visiting your friends and copying their music that you haven't purchased. <comment32309> You're kidding me?  This also prevents me from visiting myself and copying my own music that I have purchased. <comment32315> Not sure what version of OS X, iOS, or the iPhone hardware that you've got, cellu, but the recent iTunes in the Cloud and iCloud features will do much to alleviate this problem. <comment32320> @cellu, Apple weighed the risks with this design choice.  On one hand, how many customers have several computers with differing music libraries?  On the other hand, how many potential pirates are out there?  Apple like to be in control.
