How do Time Machine's checksums work? <body> The man page for codetmutil/code mentions that Time Machine records checksums of files, and lists a codeverifychecksums/code command. The man page is sparse on details, and does not otherwise mention checksums. I was wondering whether Time Machine ever automatically verifies these checksums (or if these are only verified when you run codeverifychecksums/code manually)? The page also says checksums are not retroactively computed, so how can I list the files in my latest backup for which no checksum is available? Also, is it known what checksumming algorithm is used?  precode verifychecksums path ...          Compute a checksum of data contained within a backup and verify          the result(s) against checksum information computed at the time          of backup.           No output is generated for matching checksums. Issues are          reported using the following legend:               !    The file's current checksum does not match the expected                   recorded checksum.              ?    The file's recorded checksum is invalid.           Beginning in OS X 10.11, Time Machine records checksums of files          copied into snapshots. Checksums are not retroactively computed          for files that were copied by earlier releases of OS X. /code/pre  The above is from the codetmutil/code man page in OS X 10.11.6, maybe the one in macOS Sierra has more details.
