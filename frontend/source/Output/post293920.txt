opening a new terminal in the /tmp folder exits the new terminal immediately <body> when I type this command codeopen -a Terminal ./code while I am on the code/tmp/code folder, a terminal appears and exits immediately. Before the new terminal gets disappeared, I see this message:  precodeLast login: Wed Aug  2 15:15:32 on ttys006 /tmp ; exit; /code/pre  It happens only when I am on code/tmp/code, the codeopen -a Terminal ./code command works for any other location.   Any idea, what's going on? My machine is like this (mac osx sierra):  precodeDarwin macuseer 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64 /code/pre  <comment370952> For what reason are you doing this?
