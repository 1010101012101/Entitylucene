IKEv2 VPN on macOS Sierra disconnects after eight minutes <body> When I establish a connection using the integrated IKEv2 client on my Mac (OS Sierra 10.12.1), I get disconnected after eight minutes. Until then it works perfectly as well. Any idea how to resolve this issue?  <answer265128> Someone posted a solution here: https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=110790.0  <answer280968> This is fixed in Mac OS Sierra 10.12.4, since updating to this version I can keep a IKEv2 session open to pfSense for hours.  Before on Mac OS Sierra 10.12.3 it was disconnecting every 480 seconds (8 min).  <comment331856> I am having the same issue already for months and haven't found a solution yet :( <comment332461> Welcome to Ask Different!
