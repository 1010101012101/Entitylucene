What is the best way to backup emails on mac? <body> I am looking for a backup solution for all the emails on different email clients on mac. Can all the emails be backed up at once, automatically?  I am not a big fan of Time Machine, it consumes to much time and causes system performance to lag.  <answer268591> There are different methods to backup. I use Time Machine and Crashplan for online backup. If you don't like TM, you can try Deja Vu, or if you're not afraid of the terminal you can use rsync. These all can do what you want, automatically or not. You talk about your mail. If you use a mail client like Apple Mail or Thunderbird, it's one or two folders in your home folder.   <comment337241> who are your email providers (gmail, outlook, etc)? do  you have different clients for different email accounts? For most providers, backup isn't necessary:the emails are on their server (outlook, gmail, hotmail, etc) <comment337252> What email program do you use? Maybe Apple Mail is obvious, but you should at least mention it. <comment337272> So, what backup utility do you use?  Can you not configure it to backup the directories of your email clients?
