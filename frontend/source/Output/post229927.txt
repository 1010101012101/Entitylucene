I can't run Eclipse on Macbook on Yosemite: "Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product." and I have Java 1.8 (shows in settings) <body> I can't run Eclipse on Macbook on Yosemite: "Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product." and I have Java 1.8. When I open settings I can see that version of Java is 1.8  <answer229934> Try adding this line to the .plist inside Eclipse application Contents subfolder with version of jdk you want to use: -vm/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_73.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java  <comment280565> Please include the version of your Eclipse, as well as the output of running `java -version` on Terminal. <comment280568> Currently? Now I have this:        -bash: java: command not found    Eclipse PDT is:        eclipse-php-mars-2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64(1).tar.gz <comment280569> Did you install JDK 8 from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)? <comment280571> Yes. I did. Yes. <comment280572> When I run java -version I get the proper java version too (1.83):        `java -version`       `java version "1.8.0_73"` `Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_73-b02)` `Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.73-b02, mixed mode)`  (I edited .bashrc for PATH to point to proper java version) <comment280580> I was just trying that and that actually solved the problem! Thanks!
