Empty Smart App Banner for an app in a different Store <body> I have a site that is supposed to display a Smart App Banner for an app. The site works everywhere but the app is only in the App Store for one country.  I put:  precode&lt;meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=MY_APP_ID"&gt; /code/pre  in the HTML's head and the banner is displayed correctly in the country where the app is available.  In the other countries, though, it displays an empty, grey banner with a close button and nothing else. I'd expect it to not appear at all but it doesn't seem possible as you can't control the banner in any meaningful way.  I tried to Google for it but the only grey banner case that had lots of views was about a Simulator which lacks the App Store so behaves slightly weird in cases related to it. I didn't expect the problem to appear in real devices, though...  The issue appears at least in iOS 10.0.2 &amp; 10.2.
