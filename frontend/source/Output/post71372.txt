Is there a OS X equivalent for iproute2? <body> I am searching a command line tool collection like iproute2 on Linux.   Network Utility is OK, but I would like it on the command line.   <answer130270> Different users use commands differently, so without knowing how YOU use this utility, it is a difficult question to answer correctly. According to wikipedia, iproute2 is a single piece of software designed to replace the entire suite of network tools. Chances are there is only one utility that does precisely this, and that is iproute2, which is open source software, so the source is available for download, and you can do almost anything you wish with it, such as modify it so that it can be compiled for OS X. But that might be a lot of work... it might not, but it might, so I will give you some more suggestions that you may not have heard before.  h2networksetup/h2  The networksetup command is used to configure network settings typically configured in the System Preferences application. The networksetup command lets you view all types of network parameters, including IP addresses, available network interfaces, and dozens of other variables. Besides its man page I linked to above, I found examples of its use here.  hr  h2MacPorts/h2  I recommend you install macports and search the available software it provides for network utilities until you find what you like.  Installing MacPorts is simple enough, once xcode (for Mavericks 10.9 xcode_5.1.1.dmg) is installed:  precode curl -Ok https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  tar xf MacPorts-2.2.1.tar.bz2  cd MacPorts-2.2.1  ./configure  make  sudo make install #not war!  cd ..  rm -rf Macports-*  sudo /opt/local/bin/port -v selfupdate  export PATH=$HOME/macports/bin:$HOME/macports/sbin:$PATH  export MANPATH=$HOME/macports/share/man:$MANPATH  diskutil quiet repairPermissions / /code/pre  MacPorts is worth getting to know as it is a mature package manager for OS X that maintains thousands of open source software commands, utilities, and applications.  I just ran a search on macports for the word "network":  precode port search network /code/pre  and macports returned 278 ports, and the list includes such powerful tools as netcat, nmap, and ntop, and many many more.  <answer229756> iproute2mac https://github.com/brona/iproute2mac  is available on brew so far  <comment82956> Explaining what you are trying to accomplish might result in more and better responses.
