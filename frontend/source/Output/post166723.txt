How many wifi streams does the Macbook Pro support? <body> I'm referring to the Macbook Pro Retina 15-inch (2013) model. I read that it supports three streams, and that it supports both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz.  The question is: does it support three streams on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz, for a total of 6 streams? If not, how many streams does it support at 2.4Ghz, and how many at 5Ghz?  I'm looking at buying a router, so I want to make sure that the router supports as many streams at each frequency as the Macbook does. Thanks.  <comment195433> it would be limited by your WiFi bandwidth and your Mac. And by stream you mean what exactly? <comment195453> MIMO -- the Mac has multiple wifi antennas that talk to multiple antennas on the router for increased performance.
