My ipad 3 is asking money for free apps <body> I was downloading clash royale . First it asked me my password. Then it said verification required for app purchase. I can download the apps which i have downloaded before and deleted.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wO6fS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer236240> You must have a valid payment method in your account, even for free apps.  <comment289097> It won't charge for the free apps, but for some reason, you must have a payment method to; I think it's because whoever programed it forgot to say 'don't ask for payment methods if the app is free'
