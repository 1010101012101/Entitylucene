Oops To many iCloud accounts Then hacked <body> I think I set up too many Icloud accounts and none got hacked into by a friend. Now it changes my security questions and passwords and probabably has my account and private info synced to others apple devices??? Any help  <answer87467> If a "friend" got in and changed authentication information, effectively locking you out, you'll need to contact Apple. http://www.apple.com/support/icloud/contact/  <comment102204> It happened just today?  Is that friend the sort of person who would play an April fool prank on you?
