Unchecking 'part of a compilation' for multiple items in iTunes? <body> In iTunes, under the Artists list (brought up by ctrl+b in Windows), I have an unwanted 'Compilations' artist. In it are several tracks where the codepart of a compilation/code  box is checked when one goes to the codeget info --&gt; info/code tab. I can go through individually and uncheck this, but when I select multiple items at the same time, this box doesn't appear in the info tab anymore.  Is there a quick way to uncheck this box for multiple items?  <answer49446> Yes.  Select all of the items and press kbdcmd/kbd + kbdI/kbd.  iTunes will ask you if you want to edit info for multiple items.  Select yes, then select the options tab.  There should be a dropdown menu on the right if the words "Part of a Conpilation."  Select yes, and then click apply, and you should be all set!  <comment56789> Does my answer below work for you? <comment125022> you're awesome, that works great, however I used CTRL i in windows! <comment161113> On Windows in iTunes 11.2.2.3 for multiple selections its on the Options tab (not the Info tab like it is for single selections)
