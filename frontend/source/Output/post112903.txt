Insert date & time in latest version of Numbers <body> I've looked around online and have found references to an "Insert = Date &amp; Time" capability in Numbers for OSX. But it's not there in my version of Numbers (3.0.1 -- 1483). Has this capability been removed?   I've pasted a screenshot of my Insert menu below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C8m85.png" alt="my insert menu"  <answer112909> Unfortunately, Apple removed that option in the menu bar. However, you can still get the today's date by manually typing it (obviously) or by selecting the cell and typing "=Today", followed by the return key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HsCC1.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wvhGi.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also type "=Date", followed by the return key. You can then manually select the date there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NvnvY.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BMl6C.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZFxjH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer196158> Just happened upon this thread looking for an answer to the same question. What I have discovered is to type "= Now." This will give you the current date and time at that moment.  <answer252916> According to Apple (http://help.apple.com/functions/mac/5.0/), you'll need to enter "=NOW()".  Not having used Numbers very much, I didn't know you had to enter the () after the word.  <comment204470> While both of these methods will indeed work, note that they will auto-update themselves as opposed to entering a fixed date and time. <comment315065> This appears to be true although Numbers has some sort of aggressive autocomplete that makes it pretty hard to avoid to entering NOW as a function <comment344840> But it will also update it; so if you re-open the spreadsheet later on, it'll show the current time, not the time when you set it.
