Can't add Google Account to OSX <body> I can't set up my Google Accounts on my MacBook Pro. When adding my work (one step) or private (two-step) Google account in the internet accounts panel in system preferences, it doesn't go past this screen. When I select the apps to sync, I can click Done and then Done get's greyed out. I see the grey spinning wheel very shortly. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bIsR7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  For the calendar, I tried this but without succes: Can&#39;t enable Gmail calendar syncing  I've had this issue on Yosemite as well, but now also for el Capitan. Other sites suggest going on a different network would solve the issue. I tried wired, WiFi and a mobile hotspot I created with my phone without succes.  It seems that in the process I'm going one step further than this guy Internet Accounts - Login Issue with Google and iCloud. I'm running out of options and frustration is growing strongly. Thinking about doing a clean install.  <answer226577> This issue was plaguing me for a long-time and was really annoying.  I initially thought it was an issue with a random plist or other file hanging out in the Library/ folder and I tried deleting many of them to try and get to the bottom of this.  Eventually, I was tipped off to a Keychain issue by looking in Console, which with some Google'ing, led me to this post on Apple's forums.  Ultimately, I removed all of the following items in Keychain Access, retried adding the account in Internet Accounts, and everything worked well!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLL1B.png" alt="Keychain Access items to remove"  It sounds like it was only the com.apple.account.Google.oauth* tokens that had to be removed, but your mileage may vary.  <answer273253> None of the methods mentioned anywhere worked for me. However, I logged out of my iCloud account, added the Google accounts, then logged back into my iCloud. Everything worked after I logged out of iCloud and I got past the grey screen.   <answer275055> For me, I also had to delete an entry called:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lAYDM.png" alt="enter image description here"   name = "https://gmail.com"   Kind = Identity preferences  That did it for me.  I have too many saved credentials with "gmail.com" in them (my email), so searching 'gmail' isn't so easy.  Hopefully helps someone else too.  <comment278714> I ended up reinstalling my Mac, which was overdue anyway. Still it was super frustrating.
