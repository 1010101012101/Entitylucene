Base computation via Spotlight? <body> Is there a combination of math functions I could use in spotlight to accomplish change of base ? I know I can do it on a case by case basis with normal algebra.  <answer9824> The algebraic way to do it is logsubb/subx=logsuba/subx/logsuba/subb. In spotlight, the log(x) function is logsub10/subx and the ln(x) function is logsube/subx. So taking logsubb/subx would be log(x)/log(b). However, rounding is significant enough to have the answer off even if it should be a whole number. For example, I tested log(4)/log(2) and got 1.9999999997 when it should be exactly 2.  <comment10286> As it is a floating point calculation the result won't be exactly 2. There will always be errors. (Although that error is more than I would expect I would expect accuracy to 14-15 significant figures) <comment10287> I wish there could be a way to map some abbreviations to the Programmer's mode of the Calculator.app (I guess that is beyond lazy) <comment10294> @Mark Yes, I expected it to be more precise too, that is why I added that example. The calculator application is precise enough that it returns 2.
