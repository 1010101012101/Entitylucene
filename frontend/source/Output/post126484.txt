Monitor GPU performance on OSX <body> Is there an application or tool that can monitor GPU performance on OS X? Specifically I would like to see the current speed/utilization and temperature of the integrated NVIDIA chip.   For Windows, there is CPU-Z and MSI Afterburner. I cannot find anything for OS X, not even an NVidia control panel app.   <answer126492>    I'm using iStat Monitor, which is a really great app.   strongGPU monitoring is also supported/strong. Here i found YouTube Review (not related with me, have further searches for better/other reviews)  <comment148204> Thanks for the answer. I tried iStat, and it was not informative when the Intel chip was used - no processor usage. Even for NVidia, there is only fps, memory and processor usage. <comment148216> All the temperature monitors are put together in Sensors in iStat <comment178970> I tried it with my 27" iMac with the NVidia GeForce GTX 780M and it shows the GPU processor usage as well as fps. Works great!
