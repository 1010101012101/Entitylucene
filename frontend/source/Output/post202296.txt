Stop Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client from starting up automatically <body> So I am currently running:  ul liOS X 10.10.5/li liCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 4.1.04011/li /ul  I boot up my laptop and AnyConnect is running.  I go into Preferences...Users &amp; Groups and remove code/Applications/Cisco/Cisco/code from my list of login items then I quit AnyConnect.  Shut down...turn computer on later and it's back running and it's back in my login items list.  The company I work for only uses AnyConnect for VPN.  Is there a way for me to keep AnyConnect out of my login items list? It's not that I mind it running in the background but if it is it's in my kbdcommand/kbd + kbdtab/kbd, etc... and I just find it annoying.  <answer213986> This has been driving me crazy. I finally discovered the 3 plist files that appear to control this in /Library/LaunchDaemons. But I couldn't change the RunAtLoad parameter to false, because even after I changed the file permissions I couldn't save the plist files. I  finally changed the folder permissions to read and write and applied those changes to the contained items, and at last I've been able to edit and save. I'll know for sure after the next reboot ... something I'll do in a few days because starting up again takes forever.  <answer214075> So it would seem that if you strongonly/strong install the VPN client AnyConnect will not autostart.  I uninstalled AnyConnect (version 4.x) then reinstalled doing a custom install.  I only installed strongVPN/strong, I did not install:  ul liWeb Security/li liAMP Enabler/li liDiagnostics and Reporting Tool/li liPosture/li liISE Posture/li /ul  Now AnyConnect no longer auto starts (yeah!)  Makes sense I suppose as the other parts that get installed by default are there to "protect" your system.  <answer258878> It is not the permission of the file itself that prevents you from editing, it is the permission of the containing folder. Then, you should not change the permissions of such system files for security reasons. But it is easy to edit these files: Simply copy them to some other place where you have permission to write to files, e.g. the Desktop, and edit the files there. Then move them back in with replacing option and authenticating as an administrator and the file is edited.  However, I do not see those three files you seem to mention. I find on my system only 'com.cisco.anyconnect.ciscod.plist' and 'com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist' in the directory '/Library/LaunchAgents'. Perhaps more importantly, while setting in these two files the parameter 'RunAtLoad' to 'false' indeed prevents the annoying reinstallation of the application 'Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.app' as a login item after a restart, it also makes the vpn in general disfunctional.  Has anyone found actually a solution?  <answer263905> Forget about tricky removals of plists and stuff like that, just rename Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client in Finder, thatÂ´s it.  Edit: Strange I got a downvote, because I just tested it myself, and it works without any problems at all. Perhaps not a beautiful solution that addresses the underlaying problem (by design ?), nevertheless... ?  <answer269517> Removing the following worked for me.  ul li/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagent.plist/li li/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.cisco.anyconnect.gui.plist/li /ul  <comment289620> Would you be able to tell which of the daemons under Library/LaunchDaemons is there? I'm having the same problem, and I have these:  com.cisco.anyconnect.aciseagentd.plist com.cisco.anyconnect.ciscod.plist com.cisco.anyconnect.vpnagentd.plist
