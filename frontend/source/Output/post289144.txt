How can I prevent the editing cursor from moving behind the taskbar when typing with an external keyboard in iOS 10's Mail app? <body> I've got a new iPad Pro (10.5" screen), with the cover that has a built-in keyboard. When I'm using that keyboard to type into the Mail app (iOS 10.3.2), the editing cursor gradually moves down the screen as I type line after line, until it disappears below the taskbar (which covers the lower centimeter or so of the screen). I can tap the down-arrow on the right edge of the taskbar to make it disappear, but it reappears very soon when I begin typing again.  It seems there should be some logic that keeps the active typing point above the taskbar, so I'm guessing this is a bug.  The best workaround I've come up with is temporarily putting a whole lot of blank lines at the end of the message so that my typing area moves to the top of the screen, but that only delays the problem until typing reaches the bottom again.  Any suggestions, o wise crowd? Even turning off the taskbar completely would be an improvement!
