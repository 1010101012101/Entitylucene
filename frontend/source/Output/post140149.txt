Can I activate three 3GS iPhones if i set them all back to factory settings using iTunes? <body> I was wondering if I have 3 3GS iPhones and they are all locked and I set them back to factory settings using iTunes, if I could activate them and just activate using one SIM card and then use them just with WiFi with out the SIM card?  <answer140157> Yes, as you said yourself you need a simcard to activate them. But afterwards you can use them "just Wi-Fi" without any problem. Sorry I can't write any longer answer, this is just as it is.  <comment165299> yes but can u activate more then one iphone with just one sim card <comment165355> Yes. You can pull it out afterwards.
