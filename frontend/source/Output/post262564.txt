iPad Air 2 can't play audio soundtracks <body> I can't listen to audio files on the internet. I am studying through open high schools, and need to listen to audio files sometimes. On my old iPad 4(also known as the new iPad) I could listen to these soundtracks. But I can't. I have tried turning off my iPad, but nothing changed. Help?
