Turning off "iCloud Photo Sharing" after creating albums <body> I've created many shared photo albums using both my iOS device and my Mac. The Mac (running macOS Sierra 10.12.1) now seems to have lost track of many of the Shared Albums. All of the albums are still available on my iOS device. As a troubleshooting step I'd like to try turning off "iCloud Photo Sharing" on the Mac but I want to make sure that it will not delete the shared albums. Does anybody know what happens if I turn off "iCloud Photo Sharing" and then turn it back on?  <comment329016> I quit Photos.app and then used Activity Monitor to kill "Photos Agent". "Photos Agent" automatically restarted and then chewed up the CPU and network (100-200% CPU) for quite a while. When it returned to a more normal level I started up Photos.app and all the shared albums are there, however, when I click on the Person icon to control who is subscribed the "To:" field is missing.
