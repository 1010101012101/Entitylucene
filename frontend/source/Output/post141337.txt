How to make Spotlight ONLY index certain file types? <body> I use my mac for development, and create/delete so many (big) files that I ended up turning Spotlight off, since it was taking so much time indexing these files.  I think it would be fine if I would only allow Spotlight to index pdf and doc documents, is this possible?  <answer141340> As there is no easy way (no GUI certainly) to exclude file types, your best bet might be to exclude specific directories from being indexed. Create/delete Your big files inside one directory (including subdirs) and go to emPreferences - Spotlight - Privacy/em and choose Your excluded directory (You can also drag and drop it).   <comment167035> thanks @mateusz-szlosek, but that won't cut it: I create thousands of files on a daily basis (as a dev), and they are in many different places... <comment167213> @Renaud Maybe you should organize your project(s) under a/some specific folder(s).
