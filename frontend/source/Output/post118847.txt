Boot OS X install from one Mac on another Mac <body> It seems I can't boot a system installed on one MacBook in another MacBook.  My laptop needs a few days of servicing, so I thought it would be easiest to clone an image of my OS X install on USB drive, then boot from this USB drive on another laptop. Unfortunately all I get is a grey "no-no" circle.  What I actually did was:  ol liUsing Disk Utility I cloned MacBook's (let's call it "A") boot partition onto USB partition./li liI can successfully boot MacBook A using this cloned partition./li liIf I plug USB drive into another MacBook ("B") and turn it on: the operating system on USB partition appears as available in bootloader screen (with orange icon) - but I cannot actually boot from it. Screen remains grey and a grey disabled sign is displayed./li liThe same happens if I simply use original A's drive in USB case (so this is not a cloning problem)./li liThe same happens if I try to boot MacMini using USB drive./li /ol  Is it normal behavior, that OS X install is bound to the computer it was installed on?  Is there something I can do to override this behavior and force my MacBook B to boot with operating system installed on A?  A is MacBook Retina 15" and B is MacBook Retina 13".  OS X version is 10.8.  <answer118849> Try this:  ol liInstall a fresh copy of OS X 10.8 onto your USB disk (just download the installer from the Mac App Store and select the external disk as target drive)./li liBoot from the newly installed OS X./li liUsing Migration Assistant, transfer your data and configuration files from MacBook A's startup disk. You'll have to select the option "From a Mac, Time Machine backup, or startup disk".img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZCHK.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liBoot from the external USB drive./li /ol  I know it's not a clone, but Migration Assistant does fairly well and preserves all your data. I did this when I had to transfer my system (OS X 10.9 on a "classic" MBP 13" late 2012) on my new SSD drive. It worked very well. I did not lose any data.  If it doesn't work, your problem may be that you're trying to boot a version of Mac OS X earlier than what came with MacBook B. Maybe installing Mavericks will do the trick.  See this article on Apple KB in order to know the original OS X version shipped with your hardware.  <answer118902> In the first place, I would not have used Disk Utility to clone a boot volume, I would use SuperDuper! or CarbonCopy Cloner.  Just the same, I have encountered similar situations in the past, including one quite recently. Often, if the cloned volume will not boot, it is a hardware issue â€“ the newer system often cannot be booted by an earlier OS (sometimes even with the same version #). In those instances, you should still also be able to perform a fresh install of the new OS on the cloned drive without having to lose the data, but you will need a way to boot from an OS installer disk, such as a Flash drive.  <comment138589> Thank you for a nice tip! Does the migration assistant include some low-level things like, i.e. Apache configuration, MySQL databases, tools installed in /usr/local etc? <comment138590> The minimum version requirement may be a reason actually. Both MacBooks were 10.8, but mine is still 10.8.2 while the other may have been shipped with = 10.8.3. May this minor version number be significant? <comment138635> I don't know about the minor changes between 10.8.2 and 10.8.3. When I migrated, `/usr/local` data was preserved, as well as MySQL databases. I had to reconfigure Apache, though. <comment138636> Um, actually the configuration was not lost. It was saved in `/etc/apache2/httpd.conf~previous`. :-) <comment138669> Actually 10.8.2 was the reason! I booted A from USB drive, updated OS X to 10.8.5 and it is booting successfully also on B since then! Thank you!
