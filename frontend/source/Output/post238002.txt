In Terminal I cannot type lowercase e <body> If I open a Terminal window and I type the letter "e" (without quotes of course) it beeps and will not type the letter.  Every other letter works just fine in Terminal. Uppercase E works too.  Just the lowercase e doesn't.  In every other app on my computer lowercase e works without issue, so it's not a keyboard issue.  This started sometime in the last week.  I use Terminal a lot in my job and never has this been an issue.  I have rebooted (did not fix).  I have reset terminal (did not fix).  Since I do not know the exact date when this started, I am not sure if I made any changes or installed software.  I am trying to remove anything I have installed recently.  FYI I have tried to use the 3rd party iTerm2 and it does the same thing.  ALSO - if I paste in something with a lower e, it does same thing - will not take it.  It has to be some terminal bash config issue I would think.   In fact, I copied the following strongemsense/em/strong and then I pasted it in Terminal. What appears?  strongemsns/em/strong and you can hear two beeps.    Also - in case it is unclear - this happens with the built-in keyboard on the MBP as well as an external keyboard.  Based on that and the pasting issue, I do not think this is a physical keyboard issue in any way.

In a few seconds it will virtually press the codee/code key and hopefully show up in your terminal. This would indicate that there could be an input/device driver issue (though I am clueless as to what that might be)/li /ul/li /ol  I'm not going to lie, I am absolutely fascinated by this issue and cannot wait to learn what the cause is. It's not hardware because it works in other applications, which means it's software and I cannot imagine who would swallow the letter codee/code with code.   <answer238034> I'm a bit rusty, but pasting in Terminal works differently than pasting in a GUI program: each character is sent as a separate keystroke, not as a  memcopy from clipboard to app buffer. So if the "e" has been remapped, it will be remapped in the paste as well.  Check the following locations:  codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code  code~/Library/KeyBindings/KeyBindings.dict/code  code$ defaults read com.apple.Automator NSUserKeyEquivalents/code  <answer238050> Something else you can try, is to set the Terminal to open up a text editor (emacs, vi, etc) when a new window is opened.  For example, in the Terminal preferences for "Shell", you can have it strongRun command/strong such as code/usr/bin/emacs/code.  If you can't enter kbde/kbd in the preference pane, then something even odder than what's been proposed so far is going on...  When a new Terminal window is opened, emacs strikewill/strike should start, and you can try to press kbde/kbd etc.  I have no idea what will happen, but like @Pierce above, I'm curious as to what is possibly going on.  <answer238486> Check the stty setting and make sure 'e' didn't accidentally get set as the backspace or similar.  Been there, done that. Stty something  \e Would do it The recommendation to disable/comment out .bash* would also probably uncover it.  <answer258897> Just delete .inputrc file, it's in root directory. (It's a hidden file).  <answer267643> I just found this thread after running into the same issue.  strongI had 2 lines in code.inputrc/code,/strong added in a moment of careless ignorance, strongbeginning with codee/code and codes/code/strong (which are valid bash config, but not valid readline config). strongThey seem to have been interpreted as keybinding-aliases for readline customization./strong  Removing the lines from code.inputrc/code, I have confirmed, solved my problem.  Thanks @user208052 for the relevant reminder to check code.inputrc/code.  <comment291734> Does the behavior persist if you go to another shell, like csh or tcsh? <comment291737> That's weird... try opening `applescript` by searching it in spotlight, and type in `delay 10` then press return and write `tell application "System Events" to keystroke "e"` exactly as written. When play is pressed it will wait 10 seconds, and then press e by itself. Go to terminal before that time expires and test it. If that doesn't work, than you have a serious internal problem with your computer. <comment291738> What happens if you `cat filnam.txt` where the file called `filnam.txt` contains some ASCII text with `e`? <comment291756> See  http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/letter-'e'-doesn't-work-in-terminal-793812/ <comment291773> Is this only in the shell or in any program running in Terminal? <comment291777> Check for what exactly? <comment291780> Better to try a C shell e.g. tcsh as it won't (can't) read the bash startup files or even just start an interpreter e.g. python on perl and type in there <comment292081> Whether the `e` key has been remapped. <comment292082> Yeah, I'm actually FASCINATED by this issue <comment292101> Assuming that the OP isn't too experienced in such things: what exactly should they look for? An example of such a mapping might be helpful. <comment292496> "I cannot imagine who would swallow the letter e with code" This guy might know something...https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Cisforcookie.jpg <comment292869> For Keyboard Shortcuts, look for key remappings: there's an app list on the left and a shortcut list on the right. Make sure that Terminal is not in the app list. The other two should be empty; if KeyBindings.dict exists or the defaults command returns something, post it here for further analysis.
