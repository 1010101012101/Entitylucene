Write ntfs file system in el capitan <body> I have a hard disk which is in NTFS. I want to make it writable without formatting.  I have gone through some solution for it but its working in previous version not in el captian.  I tried this link but when doing this step   precodesudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.original  sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs /code/pre  its says its not permitted.  <answer215850> It is writeable when you use a ntfs driver: it is not the disk but the OSX that you should "help".  There are several: the most experienced (in my opinion) are Tuxeira NTFS (opensource) and Paragon NTFS. Lately Tuxeira is the fastest update when the OSX is updated/upgraded.  <answer215890> I recommend you to use 3rd party softwares for this job like Paragon NTFS, Tuxeria NTFS.  <comment260590> Well did you disable SIP yet? <comment260749> sip??? whats it <comment260753> SIP = https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide.pdf
