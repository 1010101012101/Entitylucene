Free app which shows song name in menu bar <body> There are a lot of apps that show which song iTunes playins in different fancy pop-ups (using Growl i guess) but I need only a song name in menu bar and nothing else.  There are NowPlaying and emcee but they are non-free. Then, there are free apps like CoverSutra but those don’t do what I want exactly.  Is there strongfree/strong app which shows name of the song that strongVLC/strong or strongiTunes/strong plays strongin menu bar/strong?  <answer46011> Try the following freeware/open source tool: strongQuickTunes/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mi4Uh.png" alt="Screenshot"  Elderly, but may work fine still.  <answer46016> It may not be exactly what you want, but the best I can suggest is Vox which is free and displays the player controls in the menubar, which you can click on to get the currently playing song (and the current playlist). Like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7mWR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46018> h1You Control: Tunes/h1  ...is strongfree/strong, but requires an email address to receive a serial.  ul liaccess the whole iTunes library via the menubar/li liaccess playlists via the menubar/li lisee the current song in the menubar/li lisee player controls in the menubar/li linotifications/li lichange rating on the fly/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B7q1G.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jktQT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer46021> My minimalistic solution involves using GeekTool to display a emgeeklet/em like the one I made strongon top of/strong the menu bar. It runs an AppleScript every 10 seconds and will unobtrusively display nothing when iTunes is not running or not playing, otherwise just show the current track's name.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8uzg.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongAdvantages/strong: you can resize, position and format the text of the geeklet as you wish (e.g. put it in the very emcenter/em of the menu bar – something the freeware programs discussed here can't do), as well as have it display additional info such as album, artist, etc. by editing the AppleScript. See here for ideas.  strongDisadvantages/strong: The geeklet's position is fixed. When your front application uses a lot of space on the left-hand side of the menu bar, the geeklet will be shown on top of the rightmost menu items. This problem is, of course, more relevant for small display sizes.  <answer46023> I've just found Tune Buddy which does exactly what I wanted:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cuFe0.png" alt="Tune Buddy screenshot"  I'll check other apps latter, thank everybody who answered…  <answer90015> After having been on iTunesMenu for years I decided it was best to move on, considering the crashes.  So I found SmashTunes: nice and simple, plus it drops the radio station name (which is usually extremely long and just as useless)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TsLu7.png" alt="SmashTunes screenshot"  emEdit: now I prefer Tune Buddy, suggested in an answer above./em  <answer100037> Simple iTunes is a simple iTunes menu bar application which displays current track (Song - Artist) playing in iTunes in menu bar.  https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/47609/simple-itunes https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4958098?start=0&amp;tstart=0  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTcXx.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTcJG.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XxekC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment52484> In Lion, you can enable iTunes track notifications in the Dock: `defaults write com.apple.dock itunes-notifications -bool true; killall iTunes`. These don’t show up in the menu bar though, and they only pop up when a new track starts playing (or when you change a track’s rating from within iTunes). It’s not exactly what you’re looking for but it’s kind of nice. <comment52485> That can be useful for somebody else. <comment52490> If this answers your question completely, please select this as the best answer so your question will show a green check in the questions list <comment52492> @gentmatt, ah, thanks for the info, I wasn't aware of that <comment52495> That's not exactly what I wanted, but thanks anyway. Now I know about nice new tool! <comment52497> I'll select the best answer. My answer is just an option it may be useful for somebody. I like stuffe's answer the most so I'll accept it as best. <comment52498> It's GPL so I can also look at code. Nice. <comment52595> What's the menu thingy to the left of the paw print? (I'm assuming the paw print is TigerLaunch.) <comment52598> @CajunLuke That symbol represents a hand on the touchpad. This icon belongs to [BetterTouchTool](http://blog.boastr.net/). The paw is from [Growl](http://growl.info/). <comment140132> Though I like the customization this tool offers, it didn't work that well for me. I always needed to start it 2 or 3 times before it actually opens and it seems it was preventing iTunes from closing after that. I ended up removing it and installing iTunesPlay instead, which seems to work fine. <comment157369> Nice, he made [a couple more versions with smaller text too](https://discussions.apple.com/message/22384582#22384582) but I wish it supported radios and that it hid completely when paused. <comment220505> The app seems abandoned or sold to a third party, I can't download it from that site. I was able to find a simple [v1.4](http://macdownload.informer.com/tune-buddy/) and a more featured [v1.8](http://mac.brothersoft.com/tune-buddy-download.html) (with Spotify support) <comment241154> -1 for broken link.
