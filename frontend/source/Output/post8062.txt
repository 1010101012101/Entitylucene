best way to backup a jailbroken iphone 3gs? <body> I want to be able to backup my apps, sources and themes so that i can still do restores without having to go through the whole process everytime. I am a tinkerer, and sometimes I break stuff. I need a way out!!  <answer8435> Have you checked out pkgbackup on cydia? It has worked for me.   <comment8776> From my experience, there's no good way to do it. But I hope someone prove me wrong too.
