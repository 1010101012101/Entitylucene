There is a problem with your iPod <body> Tried connecting my iTouch version 3.1.3 to iTunes but itunes gives me following error:  precode There is a problem with your iPod. /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hx8rp.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer83405> Usually this is either a jailbroken device or a hardware error. Have you considered taking it in for service?  If iTunes thinks a restore will help, it will offer that instead of telling you to go to service, but that might be a good thing to try if you can't or won't get it serviced.  <comment95323> Maybe there's a problem with your iPod... <comment96006> thanks for your response, I tried restoring the iTouch, but after restoring, the iTouch gets stuck showing itunes logo.  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83243/after-restore-shows-itunes-logo
