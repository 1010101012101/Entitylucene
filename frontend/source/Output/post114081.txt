Enforcing single document copy in iOS <body> Are files on iOS locally copied within the sandbox of each application, every time they are used?  For example, if a PDF document is stored in the iPad flash and the user runs two different viewers, will this result in the creation of 2 different copies of the original document?  If this is the case, could this behavior be modified? In other words, is there any approach to enforce every application to use the original version of the document, instead of copying it to its own working space (sandbox/container)?  <comment133768> Sounds like you're trying to do DRM. Good luck with that. <comment133769> DRM is, and will always be impossible.  Voting to close. <comment133770> Is this a question asked on behalf of end users or developers? The question itself is unclear, and if it's aimed at developers, it's off-topic here.
