Text Editing Newbie Question <body> I have just started playing around with text editing using Text Wrangler. I have real estate sales data cut and pasted from a web site on which I have searched and deleted unwanted data and cleaned up the tabs and spaces nicely. However each data record is still split over 2 lines. One line starts with a letter (persons name) and the next starts with an address (a digit). This pattern repeats all the way down the document. How do I say "if line break is followed on next line with a starting digit, replace line break with a tab"  I assume that would put each record on one line ?  <answer25466> I'm assuming you want it like:  precodeVisitor82   123 E. Text Street ... /code/pre  To do this in Text Wrangler:  ol liSearch  Find/li liTick the 'Grep' option/li liIn the Find Box type:  kbd(?(?!\r\d)then)\r/kbd/li liIn the Replace Box type (or whatever delimiter you would like):  kbd\x20/kbd/li /ol  ~ Enjoy!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGYA9.png" alt="Text Grepping!"  <comment28810> Have you tried regular expression matching, combined with the `\n` line break character? <comment28816> I guess thats what I'm asking, what is the correct grep pattern. I was using \r (mac) as opposed \n (unix) but neither work. What I think should work is find: \r +[D] replace:\t note i got the example back to front above the first line starts with a digit the 2nd with a letter. <comment28817> I'm out of my depth with regex, sorry. That's why I didn't post a proper answer! Retag your question with regex and maybe you'll get more love. <comment28831> Brilliant ! I had to use D rather than d to represent any non digit character but that worked. Now I will try and work out why ;-) Thanks @ioi <comment28838> Interesting, \d denotes [digit] and \D [not a digit], so that's got me scratching my head! I'm glad it worked for you; I love Regex, it's language theory and mathematics all rolled into one. ;-)
