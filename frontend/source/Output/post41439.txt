Can I lock my screen with a keyboard shortcut? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Is there a quick way to lock my Mac?       I'm running OS X 10.7.3  Currently I've found what looks like 2 possible solutions:  ol liHot corner(s) setup in the "Desktop &amp; Screen Savers" preferences/li liCreate a service with Automator then map a keyboard shortcut in "Keyboard" preferences/li /ol  I don't like 1 because it requires the mouse, and 2 seems like a bit of a hack. Is there a built in way to do this? Or should I settle for the workarounds?  Thanks L  <answer41441> Does kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdeject/kbd  (    sleep displays ) solve your problem?    (if you set authentication for login)     Or you can use kbdOption/kbd+kbdCommand/kbd+kbdeject/kbd    Put the computer to sleep.  <comment46979> Ctrl+Shift+Eject works perfectly- thanks <comment46980> Perfect- thanks <comment192710> Do you know of a way to customize this shortcut?  Thanks!
