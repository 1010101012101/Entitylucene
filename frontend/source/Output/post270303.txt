Devices cannot connect to my shared Wi-Fi <body> I have a Late-2016 MacBook Pro without Touch Bar.  When I create a shared Wi-Fi network through System Preferences - Sharing (while I have my machine connected to ethernet via a USB-C adaptor), no device can connect.  The network is configured with WPA-2 personal security (just a password, though I have also tried with no security and end up with the same result).  When I try to connect with security enabled, my iPhone always says incorrect password (though I've confirmed the password is correct). When I try to connect without any security, my iPhone just says unable to connect. I have had colleagues try with their phones and computers with the same results.  Any recommendations?  <comment344915> I've seen a few similar issues on various boards and nobody has a solid resolution yet.
