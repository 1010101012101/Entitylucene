Now i'm buying 2 ram bloc of 8GB of DDR3 but at strong1600MHz/strong, could i've problems?  This is the ram i'm going to buy:   http://www.amazon.it/Komputerbay-MACMEMORY-PC3-12800-1600MHz-204-Pin/dp/B009GYVK1O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392556082&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=macmemory+16gb  I hope they will run at maximum frequency that motherboard support.   <answer121936> MacBookPro 5,5  Has a maximum RAM capacity of 8 Gig. (2x 4 Gig banks)  You are trying to install 16 Gig!  That will not work regardless of the RAM frequency.  <comment141606> Having a faster RAM is not a problem, it will just wait for others. <comment142207> Frequency was not a problem. I discover my mac do not support 8gb for every slot :(
