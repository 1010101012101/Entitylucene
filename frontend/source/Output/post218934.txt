OS X: When a notification is closed in one computer why it is still present in another computer? <body> Got two computers with the same OS X version, with the same account name and Apple ID, I will call these two equipments A and B.  When a notification pops-out from Calendar app in A the same goes for B, when closed the notification in A, B still shows the notification. The same is true if closed first in B then A keeps showing the notification.  This means that while using A and closing these notifications if you go back to B the same notifications need to be closed again.  Is there a way to make OS X aware that some notifications in B were already viewed and closed in A (sync)?   <answer219613> The only way to remove notifications, at the time of writing, is to take action on the notification. For example, closing a message notification doesn't close it anywhere else, but tapping the message notification and opening Messages does.  You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <comment264796> I believe this is the intended functionality, since there is no way to really guarantee that you were the person who closed the notification. AFAIK there is nothing (except possibly a 3rd-party app) that could do this. <comment265624> Tapping or clicking on a e.g. Calendar notification does not close it, the calendar app will be open but the notification will stay until the "close" button in the notification is pressed. Still closing a notification in one computer does not close the same notification in another computer which is what I would like to have.
