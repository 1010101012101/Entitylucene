Using Apple Remote Desktop for managing iOS devices? <body> Im currently evaluating using Apple Remote Desktop for multi laptop and desktop management. Can it also be used for iOS device management ?  We've got a range of devices - iPhone, iPads which are company owned. As well as staff who have their own iphones which we install email, and specific business apps for them to use.  Its very tedious having to manually type all of the usernames and passwords into each device and app to get them setup is there a way i can do this from my desktop via Apple Remote Desktop or something similar ?  <answer229425> Unfortunately Apple Remote Desktop does not support managing iOS devices at this time. The closest parallel would be Apple Configurator 2 which targets iOS automation in a similar manner to Remote Desktop.  I suggest investigating MDM solutions:  ul liProfile Manager in Apple's OS X Server app/li liCasper Suite or Bushel by JAMF Software/li /ul  These three options run either on any Mac you have or can be hosted in the cloud.  <answer229427> We use Apple Configurator to supervise iOS devices and then Meraki MDM to remotely manage them.  We push out a webclip and a global HTTP proxy setting to all devices this way.  Meraki MDM is free for up to 100 clients, after that you have to pay per client up to and including the first 100.  We were using the Apple OS X server app for awhile and while it does have some great features it is severely lacking in some key areas.  You get what you pay for.
