App for Reading - iPad &Â PDF <body> I am searching for a application with the following functionality, but cant find one:  I want to read PDFs. I want to highlight some text from time to time or add a note (with its timestamp). The summary of all highlights / notes should aggregated together so there is some special page(s) / section that contain only the highlighted text and notes.  Does something like this exist? I know there are dozens of apps for reading itself, but i am not sure whether there is app that allows me to list in "my highlighted content" only.  <answer159432> The Amazon Kindle app can do this. It's free and you can add your own PDFs to it.  When you highlight some text, an option to write a note is presented (the icon with the pencil):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TAzax.png" width="250" height="100"  Then you can go to "My Notebook" to have an overview of all text snippets and your corresponding notes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3yzE.jpg" alt="My Notebook screen"
