Speaker Icon grayed out and sound doesn't work <body> I have Yosemite 10.10.3 installed on my MacBookPro circa 2011.  At some point, my Speaker icon went gray.  If I go into Settings/Sound/Output, all I see is codeDigital Out/code entry and it says codeThe selected device has no output controls/code as per screenshot below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bp2FV.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I hold down the codeOption/code key (as in this answer) and click on the Speaker icon, I get the following list of devices.  As you can see, there are no Internal Speakers, as one would expect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogBT6.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, what am I missing?  I've tried codesudo killall coreaudiod/code as per this question.  It just restarts everything, but changes nothing.    What else can I try?  <answer263167> Thank you for displaying the audio output settings in System Preferences.  This is very likely strongphysical issue/strong with your MacBook Pro (MBP). Your MBP supports three outputs:  ol lispeakers/li liheadphone jack/li lioptical/digital output (using your headphone jack)/li /ol  When the optical output is activate there is no way to change it to speakers using a macOS setting. As this output doesn't support volume changes your speaker icon is grayed out.  Please check with a flashlight if there is something stuck in your MBP's headphone jack (debris, dust or similar). The optical output setting is triggered using a physical   strongCarefully/strong try to remove it with a toothpick.  hr  Please report back if you  ul lican see a red light coming out of the headphone jack when playing a song/li licould solve the issue with a toothpick/li liused wired headphone with your MBP in the last few weeks./li /ul  edit:  I've taken a picture to show how the port can determine whether it's a headphone plug or an optical cable. The optical cable is just a tad longer and triggers the optical output in macOS.: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VYMpf.jpg" alt="The optical cable is just a tad bit longer and triggers the optical output in macOS."  <comment329823> So, per your questions.  1.  The red light is on whenever any application is on that might play audio (like a a youtube tab in safari).  2.  I tried messing with a toothpick and a cut-off q-tip, but nothing worked.  3.  I did use iPhone ear pods several weeks ago, but that is all.  Additionally, there is no debris that I can see inside the jack. <comment329842> Thank you for your answers. As there is no debris in the jack please plug in some headphones. When you play any sound on your MacBook will it change the output in the system preferences? <comment329893> Yes.  It will change the `Digital Output` to `Headphones`, and those work fine.  But when I remove the headphones, the entry goes back to `Digital Output` and nothing can be heard and the speaker icon goes back to being grayed out.
