What is the eaisest and most secure way of sandbox emreally malicious/em programs?  <answer163824>    easiest and most secure way   Please choose A or B, not both.     emreally malicious/em programs   Are we talking invasive virus software, like the stuff that came on Sony CDs?  Either a carefully-configured virtual machine, like VMware Fusion, or an isolated physical machine. By "isolated" I mean not used for anything else and not connected to any network. Make a fresh install of the OS, do what you need, but then never use the machine for anything else.

Set up a virtual machine for instance using Parallels or VirtualBox and run the malicious software inside the virtual machine.  <comment191833> "most secure way of sandbox really malicious programs?‚Äù Run a virtual machine.
