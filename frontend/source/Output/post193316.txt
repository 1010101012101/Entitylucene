Sync chrome and safari tabs/bookmarks automatically <body> while chrome battery usage is terrible, i like it as more funcional browser thus i use it almost all the time when macbook is connected to charger, however when i'm on battery i'd like to use only safari to have better battery life.  strongIs it possible to configure using some tool or extension so that chrome tabs automatically get synced to safari (and vice versa)... ?/strong  I've tried xmarks, but i have to open every single tab manually.  <comment230440> I guess i'll have to write such tool to do that :(
