Retina-ready slideshow <body> I'm looking for an easy way to view a simple slideshow of photos with 1x1 pixel ratio, with play/pause button. I want strong1 image pixel to be equal to 1 retina screen pixel/strong, as shown by default with Preview. strongThe borders of the screen should be black/strong as in any simple slideshow (the images being smaller than 2880 pixels).  The default slideshows (Preview and QuickLook and iPhoto) upscales the images ! I don't want to pay for any software (Aperture or other), this slideshow can be done with javascript and a web browser !  <comment106667> Have you tried Preview's Full Screen mode (not Slideshow)? You can use View  Actual Size to turn off scaling. <comment106706> (+1) The full screen mode actually gives the right ratio and borders, but can not be automated, it requires the user to press a key to view the next image.
