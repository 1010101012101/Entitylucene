libicu-dev: Package not found by apt-get <body> I try to install stronglibicu-dev/strong using apt-get  precodesudo apt-get install libicu-dev /code/pre  And i get the error   precodeE: Couldn't find package libicu-dev /code/pre  I tried apt-get update but that didn't change a thing. Fink doesn't help either. Anyone any ideas?  <comment95200> Could you try `libicu36-dev` instead? <comment95201> @jaume: Same problem. Couldn't find package libicu36-dev <comment95202> Looks like finkproject.org is down (I couldn't connect from my computer and checked with http://www.websitedown.info/finkproject.org). Is Fink set up on your computer to download from finkproject.org or from a mirror? <comment95204> @jaume: Ahh! Now i see the Problem: http://finkers.wordpress.com/2013/02/10/new-hosting-outage-2/ <comment95205> Yes, set up a new rsync mirror and hopefully the issue will be solved for you. <comment95206> Still no luck. E: Couldn't find package libicu36-dev <comment95218> can i somehow tell apt-get where to find this package by passing a full url? And what url would that be? <comment95222> You can't directly specify a URL. But the link you provided  explains how to change the download URL for Fink: `The easiest option to change [the mirror] is to edit /sw/etc/fink.conf as a super user (e.g. by using sudo nano /sw/etc/fink.conf) and change the Mirror-master line directly.`  The document also lists a couple of mirrors, choose one near you. <comment95225> @jaume: I actually did that (adding different rsync/master mirror). Still the same Error.
