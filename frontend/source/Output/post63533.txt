How can I reset the sorting of my Events in iPhoto back to by date? <body> I see by default iphoto orders events by the earliest date inside the event.   That being said, i see you can drag and drop events to come up with your own ordering.   Is there a way to reset the ordering back to "by date" if you have done a lot of drag and drop of events to different places  <answer63536> From the menu select codeView/code  codeSort Events/code  codeBy Date/code.  <comment73483> thanks . . to be clear, if I switch back to Manual will that remember my last manual setup or will i have to setup taht again from scratch (as some of the picture had incorrect date)? <comment73489> I have just tested this and it will revert to your custom ordering. **Assuming** you don't do more dragging. So if you have a custom order, then sort by date, then click `View`  `Sort Events`  `Manually`, it will revert to your previous manual sorting. <comment73490> Also, I suggest using `Photos`  `Adjust Date and Time...` from the menu bar if you'd like to correct the cause of your issue and not just the symptom. <comment73496> ah, I 100% agree . . not sure how some of these pictures were associated with these dates
