Google Calendars disappeared in iCal <body> Suddenly, since today (not having installed todays OSX Update to 10.6.8, so still running 10.6.7), my Google Calendars ('delegates') have disappeared from iCal.  Strangely, I found them in the Window menu, where they are all listed. When I clen one of them there, iCal opens a new Window with only that calendar showing.  I want the combines view back, as it always was - where all calendars are shown at the right and can be selected for being displayed in the main pane.  Any ideas?  <answer22440> I found a solution: in the iCal preferences kbd⌘/kbd + kbd,/kbd   From the accounts Tab:   ul liSelect the caldav server/li ligo to the "Delegation" Tab. /li /ul  There, all delegate Calendars are listed. Select the check marked for all calendars to be shown.   I have no idea how this setting got disabled, though.  <comment17980> @Martín Marconcini: The above comment should be made into an answer. Moderators don't have the ability to do that, at least on comments to questions. <comment24922> I did. this was only possible after a certain waiting period. Redundant comment (which Philip refer to) is now removed. <comment24936> Forgive the edit - I removed the "process" and dressed up the formatting. Nice answer!
