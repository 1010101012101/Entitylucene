Installing foursquare on my iPhone 4S wirelessly in iTunes and it acts weird <body> iTunes syncs an app twice in a row. "Copying 1 of 1" happens two syncs in a row. This is happening specifically with the new foursquare app.  Steps to Reproduce:  ol liAdd an app to sync in the iPhone -- Apps -- List of apps./li liCheck one of the apps to add it to the phone./li liClick "Apply"./li liWatch the progress at the top./li liAfter it is finished, click "Sync" again./li liOnce again, watch the progress at the top./li liOnce more click "Sync", watch the progress bar, and you should see that it doesn't happen a third time./li /ol  I tested this with the new Foursquare app on iTunes on my MacBook running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.4.  The Console throws this error:  precode6/7/12 1:36:27.756 AM iTunes: _NotificationSocketReadCallbackGCD (thread 0x7fff7b7b8960): getsockopt(..., SO_NREAD, ...) failed: Bad file descriptor /code/pre  Does anyone here know what could be causing this error?  <comment60683> Did you already reboot both your Mac and your iPhone and try again? <comment60761> Yes I have. And it has only occurred with the foursquare app... no other app. <comment60814> Maybe the app is corrupt. Delete it from both the iPhone and the Mac, sync and then redownload the app from the store. <comment60828> Still happens. Only this app.
