How to install and virtualize Windows 10 from USB stick? <body> I have a bootable Windows 10 USB that I bought at Best Buy. Is there any way to install and virtualize it on my Mac?    <answer286029> Using Parallels Desktop you can import bootable disks as virtual disks. Choose File â†’ New, select existing disk, then choose USB Drive and follow the instructions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/95URS.png" alt=""
