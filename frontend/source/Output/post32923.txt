How can I enable the "back" button of a Razer mouse? <body> I couldn't find a way to get the back button of my Razer mouse to work with both Safari and Chrome, is there a workaround for this issue? I'm so used to surfing the web this way.  strongEDIT/strong I apologize for being unclear. I'm not using the Mac mouse, I'm using Mac mini with my Razer mouse. I installed the driver for that Mouse, unfortunately it only allows me to set the sensitivity and acceleration. I also tried to install Google Chrome, but it doesn't work either. When I click the side button of my mouse, it doesn't go back to the previous page. Under Windows, the default behavior of the back button in a mouse is to navigate back to the previous page, but it's not the case under Mac.br I really try to find a solution since I'm so used to the "back" button in my mouse. I feel so uncomfortable when having to click on the back arrow on my browser. Could any one help me out?

You can select the mouse buttons on the side. I had to time hitting the ⌘ + [ to get it to accept it, but once done it works like a charm.  <answer139385> All you have to do is go into the button map, go to shortcuts and select back (or forwards if you want to map that to)  <answer170301> I've been able to 'bypass' the razer option by assigning a keyboard function "backscpace" since backspace is the 'previous' function on most browsers.  Hope this helps  <answer184765> This is possible on Mac OS using Razer Synapse.  Open Razer Synapse, select the button you wish to configure. In the window that pops up, under "button assignment", select "shortcuts". Then, assign the desired shortcut, such as back or forwards.  <answer195059> Get the BetterTouchTool then you can set up Mouse buttons to gestures and the likes.  <answer243686> 1) install USBOverdrive  2) restart PC  3) open USBOverdrive, pick the button needed and choose in select menu item "Press Key"  4) assign codeCommand+[/code (back) and codeCommand+]/code (forward) for buttons  5) enjoy  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nE7Yy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer249823> You can remap mouse buttons 4/5 to mac's forward and backward keys using Karabiner.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/rRud1Id.png" alt=""  <answer282344> It is different for the Chroma with the new synapse 2.0, you go into customize - select button 4 or 5 whichever you are working with and select keyboard function, press and hold "alt" + "right" or "left" arrow key and it should remap to forward or back respectively. No need to download other software to override your already installed and fully functional software. Your Welcome.  <answer289176> I made an open-source macOS utility called SensibleSideButtons that turns the side buttons on any generic mouse into universal navigation buttons. The application runs in your menu bar so you don't have to install any extra drivers. My approach is to bind the buttons to virtual left and right three-finger swipe gestures, which offers several benefits over the usual approach of binding the buttons to code⌘ + [/code and code⌘ + ]/code: almost universal adoption across the OS (including Xcode), avoidance of destructive behavior, no menu bar blink or annoying noises, and commands only sent to the specific window under your cursor. The only requirement is that your side buttons emit standard M4 and M5 events, which most mice do.  <answer294959> In windows this is just a keybind to  ALT-Left for Back and ALT-Right for Forward  <comment37644> I assume you are looking at the Back button of the browser. Is this a general problem or just occurring on specific sites? What does "doesn't work" mean? <comment37650> Are you referring to the software back button in the browser's toolbar, or some hardware back button on your mouse or keyboard? <comment37678> I added some more information. I meant to say the physical button on the side of my mouse. <comment37679> Thanks a lot, however I'm not using Mac mouse. I'm using a Razer mouse. Any idea? <comment39930> i use a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse which also has a back button. Will try the USB Overdrive suggestion below. I really miss my back button. <comment109011> And how would you do that? Can you please add some details to your answer to make it more useful for others? <comment232825> Can you confirm that BTT will solve the problem described in the question with the mouse used by the OP? <comment236038> I can confirm that, yes. <comment284955> Works for me, using a Razer DeathAdder Chroma on Yosemite <comment292340> For Steelseries mice, you can create a macros for `⌘ + [`, just set a zero delay between keypresses, otherwise it won't work. Tested with Steelseries Engine 3 + Mac OS X El Capitan <comment350076> This will work for Finder, but will not for browsers. <comment350077> Finder-only solution. <comment350518> This is the correct answer. Thanks! <comment360723> Doesn't work for me on chrome at least
