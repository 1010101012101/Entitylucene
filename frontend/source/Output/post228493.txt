Location of Title Bar Resources in OS 10.9 <body> I'm running OS 10.9 (Mavericks) and looking to change the title bar color using system files. A grey gradient is currently used for most open windows.  A program called Flavours is currently available to edit title bar color. This can be used in conjuction with personally edited ArtFiles amd files (mainly tabs) in Flavours application support.  2/24 update: Almost all theming in 10.9 can be done from sArtFile.bin, ArtFile200.bin (200% for retina) and individual program resources.
