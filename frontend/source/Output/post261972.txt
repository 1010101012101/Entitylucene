What is iBridge <body> I got the 15 inch 2016 MacBook Pro. Today I went to the System Profiler, and the USB section, there are an item called iBridge. Here are a screenshot (I covered up the serial number just in case):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hvy9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just for the curiosity, what is that?  P.S. I am running Sierra 10.12.1 (12B2659)  <answer261981> The iBridge is the USB link to the Touch Bar. It is noted in http://arstechnica.com/video/2016/11/the-2016-13-and-15-inch-touch-bar-macbook-pros-reviewed/ in the "Inner workings..." section.
