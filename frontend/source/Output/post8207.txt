How does Office 2008 for Mac store its Recent items? <body> I don't have access to Office 2008, but require the information for a project I'm working on. I'm mainly interested in Word, Excel and Powerpoint.  This is the information I have gathered so far...  The preference file is: code~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist/code  The property keys take the form:  code2008\File Aliases\{APP}{n}/code  code2008\MRU Access Date\{APP}{n}/code  where code{APP}/code represents an Office application, and code{n}/code represents a number starting from 0.  The applications are represented by the following values:  codeMSWD/code (Word)  codeXCEL/code (Excel)  What value represents PowerPoint?  In the property list I've seen, the numbers represented by code{n}/code range from b0/b-b10/b (11 items).  Is 10 the limit? or is this unrestrained?  Finally, I've noticed that Office 2011 does not add its Recent Items to the Apple System menu:  codeApple/code - codeRecent Items/code  Is Office 2008 the same?  <answer8219> At least on my machine, this is what I'm seeing:  ol liPPT3 does appear to be the PowerPoint value/li liI have lots of items. MSWD0, MSWD1, but then also MSWD99, MSWD109, etc. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rg3cw.png" alt="Screenshot of plist"/li liInterestingly enough, it looks like PowerPoint adds items to codeApple -&gt; Recent Items/code, but Word and Excel do not. Which seems crazy, but that's what's happening on my machine./li /ol  <comment8860> 10 recent documents is the default on Mac OS X. Edit `~/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist` (entry named `NSRecentDocumentsLimit`) to see if Office uses this setting for its limit. <comment8861> This may provide a clue, or provide additional information in any answer. But it is worth taking into account that Office applications don't just display recent items in the menu, they also display them in a window that appears when you start one of the office applications. Another approach to gathering this info could be if someone could save, say 13 dummy documents, then look in ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.plist they should be able to see how many "File Alieses" were stored agains that application. @Daniel Beck <comment8862> It appears that PowerPoint is represented by the value `PPT3`.
