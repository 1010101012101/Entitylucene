Moving photos from one Photos library into another <body> We have two Photo libraries (one for my wife and one for me, different user accounts on one Mac, El Capitan). Now I would like to move most photos and videos from her Photos library into my Photos library.  How can I do this easily?   <answer229703> I think the easiest way to do this is to export the photos from her library and then copy them to /Users/[username]/Public/Drop Box. You can access these public folder from every other account on your computer and import the photos into the new library.  <answer291429> Really, you can't.    https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-10211  Short answer, if you like to edit, rate, or adjust your photos.  You have no way to migrate photos in libraries non-destructively without paying Apple for iCloud.
