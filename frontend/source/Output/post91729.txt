Show When Applications Were Opened and Closed <body> I'd like to be able to see a list of applications that were recently opened and quitted on a per user basis.  Ex:  ul licode19:25:34 Google Chrome Canary opened by John Smith/code/li licode20:45:32 Pages quitted by Julie Smith/code/li /ul  I checked the Console, but it didn't seem to specifically detail when apps were opened/quitted and by whom; it only detailed the processes that errored in those applications.  Is there a way (eg. a script I can run) that will show all applications opened and quitted within a certain time frame, and by whom?  <answer91732> You can turn on auditing.  precodeman audit /code/pre  <comment107759> Okay. I took a look at the `man` file and wasn't quite sure...what would I run specifically to turn on auditing and later access its findings? <comment107764> Yes, it's not really straightforward, pls follow the link in my answer, that provides more context for OpenBSM auditing.
