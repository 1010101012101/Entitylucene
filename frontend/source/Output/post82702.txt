Best way to remotely/offsite backup a Mac Mini file server? <body> I'm procuring a Mac Mini 10.8 server for a small workgroup (6 Macs) and want to ensure that the files stored on this server are backed up properly and offsite.  Anyone have any recommendations?  I've used BackBlaze and have had overall success despite some small issues.  I'm not averse to using that but am making sure I'm not missing something else.  <answer82711> I've been using CrashPlan on my iMac for the past few months without any issues. I haven't had to do any restores, which is of course the real test (and I hope I don't have to find out).  I'm using CrashPlan's paid storage plan, but you can just use their client and set up remote backups to another computer you control.  <comment95375> There are a large number of services that provide offsite backup, making this question somewhat vague. Are there particular aspects of offsite backup you're interested in, to guide recommendations? <comment95469> Unlimited/high storage, not painful to use, not painfully slow.  I'm considering maybe setting up a DropBox account on the server or Arq to A3 <comment95470> I use Crashplan as well, another contender!  My reservation with any product is just to make sure that the shared files are backed up - I don't care about the local OS.  Crashplan does this well by letting one specify the backup source.  Hmmm... <comment95522> Lets tighten this up with some objective measures. Stake out what best means for you specifically and perhaps some limits. A Mac mini with 16 TB of data has different needs than a simple Mac mini with server app installed.
