Disabling music autoplay with headphones <body> For some people, the fact that you get music when you plug in headphones is great - but for me it's not. Not at all. I use my iPhone to listen to audiobooks using the Overdrive app. Before iOS9, if I interrupted my book to take a call, clicking the headphone button took me right back to my book. Now it takes me to music. I also can no longer pause playback with the buttons on my headphones - I have to go back to the app on my phone to pause. (the headphones are not broken - it works on my iPad that is still iOS8)  How can I disable this feature, or teach it to go to back to my book. Navigating back to my app is not cool while driving. I tried to get Siri to do it, but she just tells me to unlock my phone. Again, driving.   I'd greatly appreciate a solution or work around.
