Can i turn my Old 2009 Imac into a Multi-use NAS server? <body> I have a late 2009 imac, everything is perfectly fine with the machine. Can i turn that into a Media/ NAS server?  <answer117802> Sure you can.  ol liGive that Mac a static IP on your home network./li liLocate it near your home router so you can connect it to the router by Ethernet cable for stability and performance./li liSet its power settings to never sleep./li liTurn off or uninstall all unnecessary applications./li liThink about what users/account settings you will use to allow access./li liSet suitable ACL permissions on the directory you will use for the NAS root storage path./li liTurn on AFP, SMB, or NFS sharing as needed./li /ol  You now have a basic NAS.  <answer118705> I have been using my early 2009 iMac as a Plex Media server since it was released.  The specs are 2.93Ghz Core2Duo with 4GB of memory.  I use it with a wired Gigabit ethernet connection in tandem with three 2TB Western Digital Mybook Live NAS units.  I have all the media on SMB shares that are mounted on the iMac as a login item in OS X.  The configuration works well, and I share the server with about 20 people and support all 4 TVs in my house plus about 3-5 concurrent remote streams.  I do notice that it taxes the CPU, but my remote users have no complaints of buffering issues.  I also have a 25mb upload through my ISP which is helpful.  Good luck.  Your iMac should work well for what you are looking to do.  <comment137183> I think that the general answer is "yes". But, as always, the details are what matters. Can you clarify your request a bit more? Perhaps a bit more specifically about what you are trying to do - and potentially what you've already looked into using? You will likely get a much better response if you can provide more details... <comment137186> To start, take a look at Plex (https://plex.tv) for media, and as for NAS, you can use AFP or SMB which can be activated in OSX.
