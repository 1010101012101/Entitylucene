Mail Signature dropdown is not shown <body> I have created two mail signatures for one gmail account.  But I can't see a signature dropdown or any possibility to add a signature to an email.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TNazS.png" alt="multiple signatures but no dropdown"  There are lot of tutorials showing this feature. e.g.br https://kb.wisc.edu/page.php?id=44554br https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19144?locale=en_US  Do I specially need to enable the dropdown somewhere or is this feature gone in mail 8.2?
