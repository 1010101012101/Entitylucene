How to Page Up/Down on Anker Bluetooth Keyboard? <body> I've got the Anker Bluetooth keyboard and I'm using it with my Macbook Pro. I used to press codeFn/code+code&lt;Arrow Up&gt;/code to do a page up, but that doesn't seem to happen with this keyboard. Does anyone know how to do a page up with this keyboard?  <answer223698> Karabiner and BetterTouchTool can remap keys to do this, but since the Fn key doesn't seem to be standard you may have to remap it to another key. BetterTouchTool is much more simple by the way.  <comment233259> It appears that typing `Fn`+`Arrow Up` gets sent as `âŒ˜`+`Arrow Up`. Not sure how to resolve this. <comment253510> I have the same problem on Windows.
