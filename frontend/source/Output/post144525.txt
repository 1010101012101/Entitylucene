How do I save a document as .doc in Pages 5.2 not .docx? <body> I have OSX10.9 and pages 5.2 and want to save the document in Pages as a *.doc. I can already export it as *.docx. I need help as to how to export or save it as *.doc?  <answer144526> To save strongPages/strong document as code.doc/code (compatible with Word 1997-2004), You need to: codeFile/code - codeExport to/code - codeWord.../code, open "Advanced options" and pick code.doc/code.  Here's article on OSXDaily about that: http://osxdaily.com/2014/08/06/save-pages-file-as-word-format/  Image from their site: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iyeYd.png" alt="enter image description here"
