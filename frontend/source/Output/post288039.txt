How to play complete albums which individual songs in Apple Music come from? <body> So I've made the switch from Spotify to Apple Music, and definitely prefer Apple Music.  One thing I would like to be able to do is shuffle all songs from all albums which I have individual songs in my library from.  In other words, although I might have, say, 2 songs from each album "saved" in my main library, I would occasionally like to be able to shuffle music from all the albums which those songs come from.  For example, I have "Monster" by Kanye West and "Bomb First" by Tupac saved to my music, but I would like to be able to play all of "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" and "The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory" shuffled together.  Does anyone have any ideas on this? I know it is quite specific and maybe a weird request.  Thanks!
