how to use different port for dns on Yosemite? <body> According to https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/resolver.5.html  you should be able to set a different port for dns, ie:  precode example, 10.0.0.17.55 specifies that the nameserver at 10.0.0.17 uses port 55. /code/pre  but:  precodesh-3.2# networksetup -setdnsservers Ethernet 185.37.37.37.54 185.37.37.37.54 is not a valid IP address. No changes were saved... ** Error: The parameters were not valid. /code/pre  what gives? how can I fix this?  <answer190205> So, the reason for this was that my ISP is filtering DNS requests on port 53. What I did in order to circumvent this hideous action by Vodafone was to install dnsmasq on my mac and add this line to the dnsmasq.conf file:  precodeserver=208.67.222.222#5353 /code/pre  as you can see I'm now happily using open dns' DNS on port 5353  <comment225663> Hi, may i ask why you want to set a different port for DNS? (some more context might lead to other solutions...) <comment225707> hi, my ISP is hijacking traffic on port 53, it has a transparent proxy, so I discovered that I can use any DNS and always get the same results from my isp, Vodafone shame on you <comment225765> The issue is that you are using . to true to delimit the paddles and the port - usual this should be :  (although your answer says #) <comment225775> tried that as well if I recall correctly. dnsmasq is another program with its own syntax
