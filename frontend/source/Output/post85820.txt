How do I stop a deleted purchased apps from continously charging me? <body> I bought this Starmaker app at the App Store for Iphone which cost me $1.79. I thought that I would be charged just one time. But every week, I have been getting email notifications that I am continously being charged $1.79 for each week. I deleted the app from my Iphone but they are still charging my credit card. How do I stop this?   <answer85821> You should go to Apple Support and contact the iTunes team. They are the only ones who can fix this.  <answer85863> It's likely you made an in-app purchase of some sort of subscription. To check and deactivate the subscription, manage you Apple ID account in iTunes by clicking codeView My Apple ID/code in the codeStore/code menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1cNZy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Enter your password and on the resulting page you should see subscriptions listed under codeSettings/code with the number of subscriptions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/otZir.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click on the codeManage/code link to the right. There you should be able to cancel any recurrent subscription plans.  <comment98927> You are being charged by Apple? <comment98929> The notification that I get is from Itunes Store so I suppose that is from Apple. <comment100191> Tell your credit card company, they will stop it. Also contact Apple about this issue, they can refund it if you really paid more than once.
