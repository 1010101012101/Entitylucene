Remember network share user name but not password <body> I regularly connect to a remote file store (webDAV) that uses different credentials to my OSX user account. I don't want to save the password to my OSX keychain, but would prefer not to have to retype both my user name AND password every time.  Is there a way to make OSX remember the user name for that share but prompt for the passowrd?  <answer97112> How are you connecting? If it's something that lets you enter (&amp; memorize) an explicit URL (e.g. in the Finder's Connect to Server dialog), you can enter the URL in the form "codehttps://username@server/code". If the URL processing does its job right (the Finder's does), it'll use that as the default username when it asks for authentication.
