Make the enter key send message on iPad <body> I use a Bluetooth keyboard with my iPad. When I am sending messages through the Messages app, the enter key does not initiate a "send" the way I expect (it, instead, just returns down to the next line). Is there a way to make the "enter" key send the message instead of dropping down to the next line? Some magic key combination perhaps?  <answer56556> There is not a way to do that. The enter/return key does the same action as hitting the button in the lower-right of the keyboard. In some apps, it sends a message or performs an action; in others, it generates a newline. Messages does the latter. You have to use the Send button on the screen to send a message.  <answer56731> On a computer sometimes kbdcommand/kbd+kbdenter/kbd is used for submitting content while kbdenter/kbd is used for newlines. I doubt it is recognized by Messages on iPad but it's worth a try.  <answer100698> On you iPad. Go into "strongSettings/strong" then navigate to "strongGeneral/strong", go to "strongKeyboard/strong" option. Select the "strongInternational Keyboards/strong" option and change your "strongHardware Keyboard layout"/strong from "strongU.S./strong" to "strongU.S.International-PC/strong". Your emRETURN/ENTER/em Key will now send messages on you messaging Apps.   <answer162329> Hit kbdEnter/kbd while kbdCmd/kbd is in action.  <comment131347> This does not work for me at all.  Does this really work for some? <comment143400> I asked the same question, changing the keyboard settings doesn't work on the ipad (you're right cajunLuke) wonder why they didn't make that do that, its a bit annoying, as you are used to speed typing once you have the blue tooth ipad keyboard.

Thanks! <comment265802> Didn't work for me either. <comment265803> Same here. It worked for me
