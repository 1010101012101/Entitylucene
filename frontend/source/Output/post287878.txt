How hot can an iPhone get before displaying a temperature warning? <body> My friend recently left his iPhone out in the sun while swimming at the pool. When he came back, his iPhone was locked with the message "iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5DSIm.jpg" alt="iPhone temperature warning"  Neither of us had ever seen this warning before, despite leaving our phones out in the open before.  strongHow hot does an iPhone need to be before displaying a high temperature warning?/strong  <answer287880> h1TL:DR - Don't leave it in the sun. Especially face up with the black display (and pobssibly bezel) exposed to direct sunlight./h1  From Apple KB:       h1Keeping iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch within acceptable operating temperatures/h1      strongLearn about the operating temperatures and temperature management of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch (4th generation and later)./strong      Use iOS devices where the ambient temperature is between 0º and 35º C   (32º to 95º F). Low- or high-temperature conditions might cause the   device to change its behavior to regulate its temperature. Using an   iOS device in very cold conditions outside of its operating range   might temporarily shorten battery life and could cause the device to   turn off. Battery life will return to normal when you bring the device   back to higher ambient temperatures. Store the device where the   temperature is between -20º and 45º C (-4º to 113º F). Don’t leave the   device in your car, because temperatures in parked cars can exceed   this range.      strongYour device might get warm/strong      When you use the device or charge the battery, the device might get   warm. You might notice that your device feels warmer in these   situations:      ul   liWhen you set up your device the first time/li   liWhen you restore from a backup/li   liWhen apps reindex or reanalyze data, like Photos tagging for faces, places, or keywords after a software update  /li   /ul      These conditions are normal, and your device will return to a regular   temperature when complete.      Here are some of the higher ambient-temperature conditions and   activities that might cause the device to change performance and   behaviour:      ul   liLeaving the device in a car on a hot day./li   liLeaving the device in direct sunlight for an extended period of time./li   liUsing certain features in hot conditions or direct sunlight for an extended period of time, such as GPS tracking or navigation in a car,   or playing a graphics-intensive game./li   /ul      strongIf your device gets too warm/strong      If the interior temperature of the device exceeds the normal operating   range, the device will protect its internal components by attempting   to regulate its temperature. If this happens, you might notice these   changes:        ul   liThe device stops charging./li   liThe display dims or goes black./li   liCellular radios enter a low-power state. The signal might weaken during this time./li   liThe camera flash is temporarily disabled./li   /ul      Additionally, if you're navigating, the device might show this alert   and turn off the display: "Temperature: iPhone needs to cool down."   Navigation still provides audible turn-by-turn directions. When   approaching a turn, the display will illuminate to guide you through   the turn.      strongIf you see a temperature warning screen/strong      If the device exceeds a certain temperature threshold, it will present   a temperature warning screen similar to this:      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l6zSS.png" width="280"       An iPhone showing this message might still be able to make emergency   calls.        To resume use of your device as quickly as possible, turn it off, move   it to a cooler environment, and allow it to cool down.   <comment363474> This provides a range of recommended temperatures, but does it specify how warm the phone can get before the warning is displayed? <comment363502> As Apple state "...might cause the device to change its behaviour" then precise temperatures ie exceeding 42.8º C triggers the temperature warning / behaviour are not given. This may be due to external effects such as the surface the phone is laying on being better / worse and a conductor of heat.
