Trying to compile thttpd 2.27 on Mac OS X 10.11 <body> I'm trying to compile thttpd 2.27 on Mac OS X 10.11 from source, but when I issue:   precode./configure /code/pre  It shows:  precodecreating cache ./config.cache checking host system type... configure: error: can not guess host type; you must specify one /code/pre  I try to search online, someone said I should copy some files from code/usr/share/libtool/config*/code but the path does not exist in Mac OS X 10.11.  How can I resolve this problem?  p.s. I have Xcode (with Command Line Tools), Homebrew, libtool, automake  and other build tools installed, but I still can't configure &amp; compile this.  <answer236214> You have at least two options:  ol liInstall MacPorts. Install codethttpd/code with this command:  precodesudo port install thttpd /code/pre  I am not using MacPorts and this is untested./li liDownload config.sub.diff and config.guess.diff and put them into codethttpd/code source directory. Execute these commands to patch the config files:  precodepatch -R &lt; config.sub.diff patch -R &lt; config.guess.diff ./configure make /code/pre  It will compile the source. You may now consider to install compiled binary./li /ol  [Original source of diff files is here.]  <comment289167> MacPorts tested & working well. Tested on MacPorts 2.3.4 to install thttpd 2.26 <comment290384> the only problem is, I cannot find the `thttpd.conf` in the system. <comment290566> @Raptor did you install with `MacPorts` or by compiling? Maybe the config file is in `/etc/thttpd.conf` or `/opt/local/etc/thttpd.conf`? It depends on the MacPorts prefix. If you are executing the binary file manually, path of the config file can be passed with `-C path/to/thttpd.conf`. You can get a minimum config file from ftp://ftp.slackbuilds.org/13.37/network/thttpd/thttpd.conf
