13-inch Macbook Pro Touchbar (2017) Turn On Issue <body> This laptop is about a month old. According to Apple the laptop can be turned on by opening the lid.  The problem is I often find the laptop doesn't turn on when I open the lid. I encountered this 4/5 times. So, it's not that frequent.  strongEach time this happened, I plugged in the charger and immediately opened the lid, the laptop didn't turn on. To turn it on, either I had to press the touch ID/power button or close the lid and open it again./strong  I was just wondering if others have encountered it. Googled it, couldn't find anything on it.
