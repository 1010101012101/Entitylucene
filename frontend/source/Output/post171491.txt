"Evernote Premium" text is hovering on my screen, despite Evernote app being closed <body> I have some text hovering over my screen, in all my spaces, for at least the past 2 weeks. I cannot recall when this started. And, unfortunately, I do not know how to replicate it.  Several attempts to contact Evernote for support have been fruitless.  This is what the text looks like :   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ddbYg.jpg" alt="screenshot-1"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0OM7U.jpg" alt="screenshot-2"  This text is there whether I'm in a terminal window, running a VM through VMWare, or watching a movie!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AetGC.jpg" alt="watching-movie"  I have uninstalled and quit Evernote, but I'm beginning to think this is not a problem of Evernote.  This is a 13" Macbook Air from mid-2013 running OSX Yosemite 10.10.1  <comment201754> when is the last time you restarted your computer? <comment201765> Really interesting problem, try to check this post, maybe it can help in some way. link: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/38012/yellow-tooltip-stuck-on-screen <comment201766> Have you tried logging out and then logging back in? <comment201846> Thank you for the suggestions. @Victor - this could help me determine what's responsible. <comment201847> @dwightk, also a useful suggestion. I restart my computer about every 3 days! Most recently, after I upgraded Evernote to the latest version. My latest find was that if I start the computer in safe mode, the text isn't there. Now to determine which start-up service is responsible :)
