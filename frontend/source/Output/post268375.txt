Configure Notes and Mail Accounts with Apple Configuration Profile <body> I can add an IMAP/SMTP email account with a Configuration Profile. I want to take it one step further and strongdisable Notes for the new mail account/strong. I don't want to disable the Notes app. I just don't want to add another account to it.  Currently I have a mobileconfig XML working with a codecom.apple.mail.managed/code payload.
