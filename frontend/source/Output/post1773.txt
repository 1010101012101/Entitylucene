Playing music from the iPhone wirelessly to a stereo that doesn't support Bluetooth <body> I'm looking for a way to stream music from my iPhone to a stereo which doesn't support Bluetooth, but does support connecting a standard audio cable to it. For example, I can take a standard audio cable and connect my iPhone directly to this stereo. However, I'm looking for a solution that will free me of wires on the iPhone side.  If there was some kind of Bluetooth device which has a standard audio cable as its output and as its input it uses a Bluetooth profile that the iPhone supports for wireless audio listening, I guess that would work.  Is this even possible?  <answer1774> The Sony Ericsson MBR-100 is a bluetooth adapter that should work.  <answer12843> I've been very pleased with my Belkin wall powered bluetooth receiver. It works well even with microwave oven and lots of other bluetooth in a house with chicken wire / plaster walls. (i.e. a disaster for 2.4 GHz radio)  <answer38309> I ended up getting the Sony DRC-BT30. It works really well and does exactly what I need it to do.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lq9PW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment43169> Damned!
