iPhone 6S, Delete HiCalculator App <body> How do you uninstall the HiCalculator app? I have tried the usual, hold down till jiggles and click on the X. Does not work, it won't jiggle. I have researched and researched on internet, cannot find an answer.  <answer239015> Go into Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Storage: Manage Storage. The app should appear in this list. Find it, touch it, and then scroll down to "Delete."  <answer239016> Have you tried doing it the iTunes way?  iTunes - iPhone - Applications - HiCalculator - Remove img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tu26e.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment293247> Can you hold down another app icon?
