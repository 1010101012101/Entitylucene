Error code -36 - cp: Input/output error - mac <body> While I'm coping the file from the External hard drive to my MacBook Pro I'm getting Error code -36. Some recommended for dot_clean option, also I've tried and facing the same issue. Even I've tried to copy through the Terminal and also getting IO error. Desperately need to copy my stuff from my external drive.   <answer243245> In a Terminal:  precodegrep "I/O error" /var/log/system.log /code/pre  This will output to the Terminal all lines in the system.log file that has codeI/O error/code in it. Output such as codekernel[0]: disk0s2: I/O errors/code are indicative of a falling and or damaged HDD. Note codedisk0s2/code is an example and depending on which disk and partition has bad sectors the disk number and slice number will be different then the example. If you have output such as this and aren't backed up then do it before doing anything else!  Note; Depending on when the last time you had an error copying something it may not be in the current codesystem.log/code file and you'll ether need to check the archived system logs or codegrep/code directly after the copy error.  If the copy is failing just on a particular file, you can attempt a recovery using codeddrescue/code on the target file to try and copy it. codeddrescue/code is a third-party utility that will need to be installed however codedd/code is a part of OS X and it too can be used, although codeddrescue/code offers more control and options then codedd/code does.  <comment299511> Thanks a lot for your response. Let me check on this and get back to you :) <comment299559> What does "Some recommended for dot_clean option, also I've tried and facing the same issue." mean.  Also how is the external disk connected and how is it formatted. What is the exact output in the terminal <comment299621> dot_clean option is to remove the .DS_Store hidden file from the folder.  WD My Book 2TB External Hard Drive Storage USB 3.0 with External Power Adapter.  The format type is FAT32.
