My /User directory permissions always changesâ€¦ should I be worried? <body> I've noticed that my /Users directory on OSX always gets changed to "rwxrwxrwx"  I'm not sure how this is being changed? Only just started happening  Could it be malware or such?    <answer131183> Install iTunes 11.2.1  Source: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6251  Description: Upon each reboot, the permissions for the /Users and /Users/Shared directories would be set to world-writable, allowing modification of these directories. This issue was addressed with improved permission handling. For information on the general content of iTunes 11.2.1, see http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5434.  <comment153904> If you have any remote connections or sharing DISABLE them in system preferences. <comment153907> Does enabling them change the write access to allow all? ... or do you think that sharing is maybe allowing insecure access? <comment153920> What version of iTunes do you have? The latest 11.2.1 has a fix for this as 11.2.0 showed this issue <comment153933> disabling any remote access will tell you if the issue is local or remote <comment153938> if the USERS becomes grayed out (invisible) then follow @Mark suggestion
