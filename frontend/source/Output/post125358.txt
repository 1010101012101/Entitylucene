Artifacts and framerate drops can reveal issues with your GPU. A frame of reference would be ideal, but if you're not a gamer, and weren't playing any games before your concern arose, you might be hard pressed to find an identical HW/SW setup to compare./li liVarious benchmarking apps out there, some with specifics to graphics processing, kinda like Geekbench. Then possibly comparing to similar systems on the web for specs, if there isn't a DB of results for your chosen app out there already. If it's way too far off the middle for your system, probably an issue, mb one specific to your card, maybe somewhere else (hangs, slowdowns, etc. can be caused by almost any component, the trick is to eliminate possibilities).  ul liNovabench is kinda comprehensive for more than just GPU (CPU, RAM, Disk)./li liCinebench is for CPU &amp; GPU benchmarking./li liXbench is in dire need of an update. for discussion and workarounds see: https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10081/xbench /li /ul/li liThere could also be some manufacturer/model specific apps and/or firmware updates.

It helps sometimes to know what HW/SW setup you have for questions like this so helpers can be more specific on top of the general info.  Finally, as an anecdote, the vast (did I say vast?) majority of major Mac failures in my work have been GPU related. Do we blame Apple or Nvidia/ATI? I'd say both. emInsert rant here./em  <answer125728> You can access Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics by restarting the computer while holding down kbdD/kbd  You mentioned Tech Tool Pro, which I haven't used for like a decade, but it was pretty good back then. I don't know of any software out there that is more comprehensive.   Other software you might try, but I don't think these really do what you want, they are more aimed at data recovery and file system verification:  Onyx - Free   Disk Warrior - Commercial   <answer125744> The likelihood that a single tool or utility will provide all of the diagnostic capabilities that you are looking for is emvery/em slim; if you do happen to find such a utility, there's a decent chance that its support for said capabilities will be shallow.  So while it may seem like a good idea to try to find a really generalized and versatile hardware diagnostics app, you'll probably be better off with getting smaller more specialized apps that are designed to only check emone to a few/em of your system's hardware components.  In addition, some hardware components such as your system's PSU (power supply unit) are best checked with specialized electrical equipment designed to check for faults in your PSU, such as your PSU is no longer capable of sustaining the level of Watts your system requires.  h3Hardware Health Diagnostic Applications/h3  Hard-Disk/Solid-State Drive  ol liSMARTReporter  ul liUser Interface is kinda compact (feels a bit overwhelming with everything squished together)./li li$4.99/li liAvailable in the App Store./li /ul/li licodesmartmontools/code  ul liprimarily command-line emonly/em, GUI depends on the X Server,but even if you do have XQuartz installed, GUI doesn't show up.

In addition, be sure to run and check the output of codesudo dmesg | less/code: in my experience, if your system is experiencing problems, there's a high likelihood that codedmesg/code's output will shed light on the situation.  h3Mac OS X boot-time keyboard shortcuts (in no particular order):/h3  ol liHold down kbdD/kbd during startup  ul liTakes you to Apple's Hardware Test utility (or Apple Diagnostics, depending on Mac model)/li likbdOption/kbd+kbdD/kbd can be used instead to try starting up Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics over the internet/li /ul/li liHold down kbdAlt/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd during startup  ul liClears the emPRAM/em (parameter RAM) and emNVRAM/em (non-volatile RAM): if either the PRAM or the NVRAM become corrupt, problems will ensue.

These can be used to ease the diagnostics process since they're (at least Parted Magic and GParted) are designed with system maintenance in mind--not to mention the fact that you'll have access to a far larger software repository with any given Linux (that has a package manager) than you would with brew, for example.   <comment147074> What are you trying to test? GPU benchmarks or just system diagnostics? <comment147077> There is Apple Hardware Test (AHT) and also Apple Service Diagnostics (ASD). ASD is not publicly available but sounds more in line with what you may be after? <comment147094> thank you both for your replays i was thinking about something inline with AHT and ASD tho AHT can't be used on some macs due to no cd/usb/internet access  regarding the GPU i don't want benchmarks i want hardware diagnostics <comment147108> hahah great answer thank you for that however as stated I'm more in a need of a Hardware diagnostic rather than a Benchmark test, i can see your logic behind it however its not what I'm looking for <comment147118> @Macmaniman what are you testing and why? There are tools to test certain things individually but every tests has a function. What function are you looking for/needing? <comment147145> @AndrewU. i need to do a complete hardware test on some MacBooks and one iMac, that is to do a thuru test of all components GPU, CPU, HDD, ODD, logic board, memory.   apple hardware test would suffice however i don't have the option to use it on all the machines. if there is somehow a way to download and run it through say an usb thumb drive, this would be ideal <comment147156> you could try `system_profiler`, the Macbooks should have shipped with it on them, so downloading it shouldn't be a huge concern.  I don't know whether iMac ships with it too, though. <comment147164> @AlexejMagura make that an answer <comment147165> try dwightk's suggestion of holding down "d" after reboot. This works with some models, but without knowing which you have, we can't tell you for sure. I think most ~2008+ have AHT built in. Apparently I wasn't coherent enough last night because it was supposed to be my first bullet… doh. <comment147166> @AlexejMagura , is the output in the CLI any different from what the GUI has? <comment147170> @NOTjust--user4304 by GUI, do you mean system information? <comment147174> @AlexejMagura system_profiler is a command that you use in Terminal, or the Command-Line Interface (CLI). Whereas every Mac since, I'm pretty sure even before OS X, has had "System Profiler" as a program in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the computer system. I'm asking if the output from the command in terminal has any more detail from the output in ".app", or if it's all the same. Maybe there are flags that can be used to make the command more useful if that is the case by default. <comment147175> @NOTjust--user4304 I dunno, there _are_ flags that you can specify on the command-line, but I don't understand why you'd want to use a GUI when the CLI version will probably be more verbose, and even if it isn't more verbose, on the command-line you can pipe the output of system_profiler to something like `sed`, `grep`, or some other tool to make it easier to find crap.  I should, however, mention (as a disclaimer) that I'm a server admin, so I'm kind of biased in favor of the command-line. <comment147208> thank you however apple hardware test is not an option, perhaps i wasn't clear enough <comment147209> these seem to be a great apps for readin your performance however i would like to know that everything works perfectly at a hardware level  you've listed some great apps tho however! and thank you for that <comment147349> @Macmaniman if you just want to make sure that everything is working _as expected_, I would check your system logs.  Are you experiencing any hardware problems/issues in particular that you could, for example, describe? Or are you just looking for apps that could be used to find the source of said errors in the event that they were to occur? <comment147427> say for example i want to buy a computer second hand, i want to make sure everything works properly, without spending hours of checking and loading each component. or say for service, if your computer is having issues. <comment147428> also, your answers are great. tho it doesn't really answer solve my issue :( <comment147438> @Macmaniman Also, are you looking for tools that _stress-test_ hardware or tools that just check to see that the given hardware is able to operate at full capacity and capability? <comment147442> I'd like to put a [pause on this post](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2026/what-can-be-done-to-improve-this-question) to see if it needs to be a CW post or if it can be tightened up. Mac are broad. One tool that works for PPC macs might be worthless or harmful for another Mac. Similarly - is this software or hardware that's being diagnosed? I worry that some great answers are going to be hard to find based on the vague wording in the question (also evidenced by the comment volume trying to understand what the bounds for this are). <comment147531> really more of a test to see if its operating correctly and Yup at full capacity! <comment147532> @bmike as stated it needs to be ha hardware test similar to apples own hardware test. i need it for situations where i can't run AHT. pretty simple <comment147535> *Why*/*In which situations* can't you run AHT? <comment147541> @Macmaniman, k so I haven't edited my answer since yesterday, I believe, but the applications I now have listed: "those _are_ the droids you're looking for"? <comment147596> for example in some cases you need a cd witch you don't always have access to <comment147597> i can see that and i really appreciate it, i would like to give a right answer just for effort, its a third party app, witch is perfect, but as far as i can see however, it only covers the hard drive and memory <comment147628> @Macmaniman when I get off work, I'll see about adding sections for ODD (optical disc drive), GPU, CPU, and if I come across anything else (like something for checking your motherboard) I'll add that too. <comment147629> Very true.  After I put my chosen Linux distro on my first laptop (some 100 distros after the realization that the OS I'd always wanted actually existed), my optical disc drive subsequently went the way of the world; so I had to become accustomed to using USB drives/Disc Images (ISOs) for everything from boot-images to the install discs for video games. <comment147730> thank you so much, if all that is added you got my vote!
