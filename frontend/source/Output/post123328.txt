Unable to load preference pane <body> I installed TCPBlock and whenever I try to open the TCPBlock preference pane I get the error:  "Unable to load TCPBlock preference pane".  Does anyone know what might cause this?  <answer123330> h1TCPBlock and OS X 10.9/h1  Comments associated with the last TCPBlock blog update suggest there may be problems with OS X 10.9, Mavericks, and tools like Clean My Mac.  h2Console/h2  Use the Console.app utility included in Mac OS X to look for error messages. Console.app is located in: strong/Applications/Utilities/strong  With Console.app running, try opening TCPBlock preference pane again. You will likely see a little flurry of messages.  Possible problems include the preference pane being built for 32-bit Macs only, and missing frameworks or dependencies.  <answer123873> I ended up doing a search using EasyFind, since OS X search doesn't find much, and deleted some remaining files, reintsalled, and it works now.  <answer254894> TCPBlock seems to have been discontinued an doesn't work since El Capitan. https://www.tripmode.ch/ looks like a good alternative.   <comment144721> I didn't find much, but I ended up doing a search using EasyFind (since OS X search doesn't find sh!t) and deleted some remaining files, reintsalled, and it works now.
