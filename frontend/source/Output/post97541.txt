Unable to set up lan in macbook pro ( with retina display) <body> In macbook pro there is no lan port, for that I bought lan to usb connector.  But I am unable to setup net-connection.  In System preference  networks there is no ethernet option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/52XS0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried this link https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4835488?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer97559> There's a add button at the bottom right portion of that screenshot. Click it.  It will present you with options to add a new interface, and if wired Ethernet is available on your Mac, it will appear there.  <comment114446> As long it is not plugged in there will be none. <comment114452> Ethernet connection not appears after plugging in. <comment114473> Than there is no juice on the cable! <comment114541> I tried that, but it doesn't show any Ethernet option . <comment114548> @TLE Goto System Profiler and select Ethernet from the sidebar to see if any Ethernet device is available. Or if using USB/Thunderbolt adapter, try going to their respected section and see if the device is shown. <comment114549> @TLE Please edit the title and content to clarify that you are using a MacBook Pro with Retina Display (or MacBook Air) and a Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter. <comment114834> http://www.domosupport.com/download.php  I am using U1 model of nhance product. I tried to download drivers of that product but didn't find dmg file. <comment114849> This link has detailed information to installing kext manually. http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/12/how-to-manually-install-kernel-extensions-in-mac-os-x/ <comment114850> Extract `Archive.pax.gz` file and you will get a kext file. You could install that kext file copying that to `/System/Library/Extensions` and then fixing disk permission with Disk Utility which will install that driver. This is NOT recommended, since that might crash your system. I will suggest buying a dongle that works out of the box, like ones from Apple. <comment114885> I tried to move that file, but it gives error "not properly installed". <comment114898> Have you follow osxdaily's steps?
