Mavericks Time Machine is stuck in the middle of backing up, other times stop unexpectedly <body> After upgrade to Mavericks I fail to complete a single backup with Time Machine. Tried it both for third-party NAS (QNAP TS-210) having a Time Machine service, and for a simple external HDD enclosure (Mac OS Extended Journalled format).  Some attempts to backup just stop itself long before the estimated time, with no result or error message; with no backup actually completed.  Others just stuck in the middle of copying (not Preparing, but in MBs backed up progress bar) for several hours without anything that could look like activity in progress.  Mavericks 10.9.2; QNAP firmware 4.0.3; Macbook Air Mid-2011.  Other Mac (MBP 2010, Mountain Lion) backs up to the same NAS just fine.  For external HDD, console is full of messages like this:  precode03-05-14 20:18:49,000 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 6522 [backupd-helper] 03-05-14 20:18:49,549 com.apple.launchd[1]: (com.apple.backupd-auto[6522]) Idle-exit job was jettisoned.

With QFix installed, backup became much faster.
