Bootcamp windows installation not allowing Windows 10 <body> Hi I am trying to install windows 10 on my macbook pro 8,2(late 2011), when I open Bootcamp it is having options to create windows 10 installation in usb as seen in image.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zMD33.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, I am able to create the windows 10 install disk sucessfully using the iso, but after that the bootcamp popups the error message as seen in image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OnCRc.png" alt="enter image description here"  So after reading the message i decided to make windows 7 install disk which not in the list but i tried checking the same windows 10 option and added the iso file of windows 7 then again the bootcamp pops up the the error as seen in image  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wWBOc.png" alt="enter image description here"  As seen it is not allowing me to go in both the cases, if I do the partition manually it is also not seen in startup disks also.  Want to install windows on mac any kind of suggession will be helpfull.   <answer263069> it should be possible to install Windows 7 on your Mac using Boot Camp. Apple has a rather lengthy KB article on exactly how you should proceed.  <comment329605> my bootcamp version is 6, when i check at last option that is windows 10 install is says only windows  7 is supported by this mac but doesnot provide any option to create windows 7 install disk.
