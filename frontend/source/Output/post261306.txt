Waking Up Sierra With Multiple Monitors <body> I have two external monitors plugged into my MacBook Pro.  Before I upgraded to Sierra, MacOS seemed to remember my monitor configuration when waking up and there was almost no delay.  After upgrading to Sierra, when I wake it up from a sleep, it goes through a sequence where it is "discovering" each monitor individually, and the system is unusable for about 20 - 30 seconds while it adds each monitor individually.  Screens flicker off and on several times.  Is anyone else experiencing this?  Is there a hack or a setting that will make it remember faster and without all the flashing and flickering?  <comment327824> for me helps to remove cables fro 2 or 3 monitors and then it works again fine. But it still really annoying because even brightness resets after that.
