iPhone requesting password for different Apple ID when updating apps after updating iOS <body> My iPhone 5 was updated to iOS 8.3 with a different computer. Now the apps I downloaded before the updates by computer was made, are now bothering me a lot. Any time I want to update them, my iPhone asks me to enter the password for the Apple ID of that computer I used to update it.  <answer187049> The computer you used to upgrade iOS was apparently signed into a different Apple ID when you upgraded your device. The thing that doesn't make any sense is that the Apple ID signed in on the computer shouldn't matter - you should have to sign-in on the device with a a different Apple ID for it to matter.  That said, you can try signing out of the App Store on the device (App Store app  bottom of the Featured tab  tap on the button that says "Apple ID: xxxx@xxxx"  Sign Out), then sign back in with original Apple ID.  <comment220917> Then you need to wipe it & go back to your original computer & restore from your own latest backup. You have, by the sound of it, hybridised your device to someone else's ID.
