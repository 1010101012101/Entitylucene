Deleting pictures from hard drive forever <body> I bought Mac a couple days ago and I don't know anything about it. I uploaded a lot of the pictures but then it said that I didn't have any storage left so I went ahead and deleted a lot of pictures. Then I went to the photo trash and selected delete them all. But I still seem to have problem with my storage and I don't know what I should do to get rid of all of those pictures forever. I checked some of the questions here that seemed to be the same but they didn't help me out cus they we all talking about deleting iPhoto but I cannot find iPhoto even tho I search it on Spotlight or Finder. Somebody please tell me what I should do.    <comment314636> What kind of Mac did you buy and what's the operating system (click the Apple logo on the top left and select `About this Mac`)? <comment314641> It says OS X El Capitan with a processor of 1,6 GHz and a memory of 8 gb 1600 MHz DDR3 (i don't even know what that is) <comment314777> Did you empty your trash? Have you accidentally deleted Photos.app instead of the actual photos? <comment314882> I emptied the one called Recently Deleted but I don't see anything in "trash". I'm pretty sure I didn't delete Photos.app because I still can use it.
