How do I add keywords to iPhoto images using Automator <body> I have an Automator service that adds selected photos to iPhoto. I would like it to also add a specific keyword to these photos.  How can I do this?  I found this question, but the only answer does not set the keywords via automator.  <answer50645> If you are using the “Import to iPhoto” Automator action, that returns a list of iPhoto photos you can process. Just add an “Applescript” action after your import action with the following script:  precodetell application "iPhoto"     repeat with importedPhoto in (input as list)         select importedPhoto         assign keyword string "your keyword"     end repeat end tell /code/pre  – that should do the trick.  <comment58200> Thanks, this did indeed do the trick. You left out the word `string` after `keyword`, though. I went ahead and edited it in to help future visitors.
