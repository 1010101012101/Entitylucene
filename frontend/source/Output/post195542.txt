A problem with the Telegram app- online status <body> I have a problem with my device and it would be great if anyone can help me with this problem.  In Telegram Messenger app; when I close the App, either by closing it or by coming out from the app my "ONLINE" is on just temporarily.   If I check my status from another device in front of my name is still written ONLINE.  Is there a way to change this On-line reporting to be more accurate.  Regards.  <answer195547> Previous versions of Telegram used to linger on changing one's status from codeonline/code to codelast seen just now/code for about 5-10 minutes. (Not documented, just my observation.) But I think they've fixed this in the latest version. Please update Telegram on all your devices and check if this problem still exists.  <answer201877> It depends on the other device that shows your online status, If you sync the device it will show your status online.
