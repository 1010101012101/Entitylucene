How do I force Dash to import ReadMe & Man Pages for Homebrew installed Formulae? <body> Dash ignores these documents and only imports man pages for system default tools.   I can find no mention of this in either the Dash or Homebrew user docs nor in user-focused discussions of either; I assume, I'm either using terribly incorrect search terms and/or it's completely abnormal for docs in usr/ to be ignored by Dash, because it seems impossible that no one else has ever wanted to read man pages for Homebrew installed tools in Dash.   So, [tl/dr] what do I need to do to force Dash to scan usr/ as a source for docs?  <comment354177> man pages of homebrew installed tools properly populate Dash's man pages here. They should reside in /usr/local/share/man/*. Also check /etc/man.conf, /etc/manpaths and /etc/manpaths.d for irregularities.
