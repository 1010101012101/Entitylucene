My iPhone 4S won't sync calendar with Exchange <body> I have an iPhone 4S that I can't seem to sync to our corporate Exchange server.  Email syncs fine, however calendar items do not sync at all.  This is happening since 2 weeks ago.  I have removed/re-added the account on my iPhone, checked the time zone, have set the Exchange calendar as default, have set the sync to 2 weeks. Also, verified that the email address is not synced with iTunes. Nothing helped.  Any ideas?  <comment56201> If it used to work and email is still working, then it's probably a server problem. <comment56212> All the other iPhones on the company are working fine. Only mine is not working well with the calendar. <comment56492> I need HELP !!!!
