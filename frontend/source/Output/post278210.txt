Kill application when closing lid, but not on "display sleep" <body> I wish to shut down an application when I emclose the lid/em on my Mac. This works using codesleepwatcher/code:  precode/usr/local/sbin/sleepwatcher -s ~/.sleep  ~/.sleep: killall &lt;application&gt; /code/pre  However, "sleep" seems to be triggered as well when the displays is turned off as well (I have "Turn off display after 15 minutes" when on battery.)  I tried codecaffeinate/code to prevent this, but the app is still killed when the display is turned off. This may be because in later macOS versions "display sleep" and "computer sleep" seem to be the same.  precodecaffeinate -d -i open -a &lt;application&gt; /code/pre  Is there any way to kill the app emonly/em when closing the lid? The only workaround I can think of is to replace "turn display off after 15 minutes" with a "show screensaver after 15 minutes".
