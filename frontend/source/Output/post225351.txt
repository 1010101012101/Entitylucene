Stable and free CAD for OS X 10.11, El Capitan? <body> Are there any stable and free CAD programs for OS X 10.11, El Capitan?  I just need to review one CAD file. I find many CAD programs for OS X 10.10, Yosemite, but not for El Capitan.   <answer225360> If you only need to review a file, try using a free demonstration of:  ul liAutoCAD/li liMacDraft/li liVectorworks/li liSketchUp/li /ul  For more CAD applications on the Mac, see Pure Mac's CAD section and AppleCAD's extensive list. Most will work with OS X 10.11.  <comment273446> What file format does the application need to open? AutoCAD DWG and DXF? <comment273448> What makes you think that CAD applications for 10.10 will not work in 10.11?
