OS X dialogs: Can I use 'Enter' to invoke the *currently selected* button instead of the default one? <body> In an OS X dialog, there a way to make 'Enter/Return' invoke the emcurrently selected/em button instead of the emdefault/em one (and, if possible, make 'Space' invoke the emdefault/em button instead). That is, can I swap the behaviors of 'Space' and 'Enter' in this situation?  [This would keep this behavior consistent with that of the web's, and other platforms like Windows and Linux]  <answer84336> Updated:  Explained here https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/69305/44377  Also, I use KeyCue to find most-if-not-all shortcuts in any context.  <comment97070> This UX behavior bothers me to where this should be fixed upon pain of death.  Modal alerts are evil because they interrupt users.  Modal alerts without keyboard shortcuts are embarrassingly stupid.  Alerts should be batched in one system, like email, so they can be handled at will. <comment97088> I already had that option selected. It has, afaik, nothing to do with what I am asking - i.e using 'Enter' to invoke the selected button instead of 'Space' <comment97103> My bad.  Updated. :) <comment97127> The link just explains how to use the 'Space' and 'Enter' keys to invoke buttons in a dialog, but says nothing about how to swap their behaviors :) <comment199563> What do you mean by "currently selected" ? In a Mac dialog, traditionally, there is no way to select a button, we can only activate the button â€” usually by clicking it.
