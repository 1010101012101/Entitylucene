Remotely upgrading to El Capitan broke Screen Sharing <body> We have a remote Mac Mini acting as a build server that we use Screen Sharing to connect to and remotely manage.  Well I recently upgraded this box to El Capitan and now Screen Sharing won't connect to it at all.  I've upgraded the OS remotely before and never ran into a problem. Is there any way to connect to this box and get screen sharing working or am I S.O.L.? I can ping it, but I can't seem to do anything else (file sharing, ssh, screen sharing).  strongUpdate:/strong I did a port scan on the server and it can't find any open ports. I guess that pretty much settles it then. I still don't understand how upgrading and rebooting the box could have so completely bricked it. I mean did Apple really not remote upgrading a possibility?  I'm half picturing some "Welcome to El Capitan, just a few screens to click through before you get your computer back" dialog to be sitting on the screen right now.   strongUpdate 2:/strong So we got this resolved, but it looks as though something may have gone wrong during the upgrade process as our IT guy says it wasn't responsive when he plugged a monitor into it. He had to reboot the machine before it would respond. Anyway just wanted to give a heads up to others.  <answer214480> The three ways to connect are Apple Remote Desktop, ssh and remote Apple Events. If you have one of those enabled, you can kickstart screen sharing with a command line tool:  precode   sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  See these for more details:  ul liRestart Screen Sharing Service on Mac mini Server/li liRemotely turn on screen sharing/li liactivating screen sharing remotely/li /ul  If not, you will have to have the machine shipped to a human or a human shipped to the machine to take local corrective action and diagnose the failure.   <answer217389> eAfter a local update to El Capitan, I could also not get the Screen Sharing (VNC://) to work. Not with ARD or the Screen Sharing Client. Rebooting and re-set the Sharing setup did not work. I got it back to work with this Shell commands (it will work local via Terminal or remot via SSH): (put in YOUR-SHORT-USERNAME eg: admin)  precode sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -allowAccessFor -specifiedUsers  sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -configure -access -on -privs -all -users YOUR-SHORT-USERNAME  sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -restart -agent  sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate /code/pre  <comment259024> Do you have ssh enabled ? <comment259097> It *should* be enabled, but is refusing a connection on port 22 when I try. <comment259098> Unfortunately I can't even get to a command line at present. The only indication I have that the server is even there is a ping. It's refusing ssh connections, screen sharing, http, and file sharing. We're sending someone over there next week, but was just exploring my options. <comment259158> Ok looks like the firewall is enabled and blocking all incoming connections :( unless you get Team Viewer, LogMeIn, or another tool, you'll have to be on-site and reconfigure the services/firewall <comment259368> This works better - "sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -restart -agent -privs -all" - your line gave me a _Extra arguments: 'restart'_ error <comment259459> @DannySchoemann Want to edit my post to fix it :-) I think I missed the -, but am not certain. Thanks for the comment!
