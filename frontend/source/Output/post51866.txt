Is there a way to scroll the toolbar icons of an application? <body> On a 24" display, there is enough space to display all the toolbar icons of my applications.  But on the MacBook 13" display some of them are not displayed.  Is there a way to scroll the tools bar in order to see the entire set of icons?  <answer51870> Not exactly what you are looking for (not a scrolling solution), but you could have a look at Bartender. By putting the least important icons in there, and leaving the most important ones in place, you could have 2 levels of icons, hopefully giving enough real estate to display all of them in your 13" display.  <answer51879> I use AccessMenubarApps which works on the basic principle of temporarily replacing the current menubar with a shorter one to allow all the menubar icons to be visible. It can be accessed by clicking on the icon, via mouse gestures, or a configurable hotkey.
