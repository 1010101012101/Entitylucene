How to pause music while playing video in Keynote? <body> I am currently using the newest version of keynote and have run into a major issue. I am playing audio throughout the entire presentation but i would like to add videos into the presentation.  When i export the videos in and play the presentation, the music plays while the video plays as well! Is there a way to pause the music on those specific slides?  <answer151182> If you know how to use Automator:  Automator - create Service - add applescript block  precodetell application "iTunes"        if player state is playing then         pause     else         play     end if end tell /code/pre  System Preferences - Keyboard - Shortcuts - Services - check the new workflow and bind it to a keyboard shortcut.  <comment177895> Afaik it's Keynote playing the music as well as the videos? The question makes no reference to iTunes? <comment177897> That's very true.
