Safari bookmark to activate an Automator action <body> I'm trying to make a HTML page that I can save as a bookmark in Safari or Google Chrome that runs an Automator workflow, action or application, or possibly an Applescript.  It's only for my personal computer and I want to use the simplest possible approach to accomplishing this.  <answer41095> A codefile:///code link (with the path to your desired program) can point to a workflow, application, or AppleScript on your local drive. Clicking the link will not run the application (this lack of functionality is generally considered to be a desirable security feature), but it emwill/em open a Finder window and select the file in question, so pressing kbd⌘/kbdkbdO/kbd or kbd⌘/kbdkbd↓/kbd will run the desired program.  <answer69209> Here is an idea with a local apache server.   ol liInstall Apache on your machine./li liLocate Apache access.log/li liWatch the changes on this file with this command, and look after a specific string in the log: here, I am watching the access to my Drupal web application/li /ol  Type this command in a terminal  precode$ tail -f access_log | awk '/drupal/ {system("/Applications/capture.app/Contents/MacOS/Application\\\ Stub");}'  /code/pre  codeCapture.app/code  is an automator application. It can be anything you want, for example:  precode$ system("say Drupal");  # speech synthesis $ system("open -R /");   # opens the Finder /code/pre  This is not a clean solution, it processes all the log when it starts, and it's attached to a terminal. Apache has mechanisms to do this with hooks.  You don't even have to have something at the URL. The only important part is the request in acces_log.  <comment46315> I don't think that this would get past the secure sandboxes of either browser. Why not just a link on the desktop or dock? What does the workflow do? Is it talking to the current open page in the browser? Maybe a Javascript bookmarklet is a possibility?
