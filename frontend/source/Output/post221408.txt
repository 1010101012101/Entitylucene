Location services incorrectly reporting location to app <body> I am using a third party financial app on my iPhone 6, and for some technical reason my iPhone is unable to provide the app the exact location. It always shows that I am not in the UK, because in order to run the App the location must be United Kingdom.  I reset my router and tried with a different Wi-Fi but it's still not working.  <answer221413> Firstly, geolocation is not related to the WiFi you are using.  Then, check in your iPhone emsettings/em if the strongLocation Services/strong (inside emPrivacy/em) are strongOn/strong (therefore enabled) for your particular App.  <comment268097> Your title should be relevant to the actual problem you are facing. A nondescript title obfuscates the content of the question. I've edited the title to be more specific but feel free to edit further.
