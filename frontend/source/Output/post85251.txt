Apps that were active won't launch after crash <body> im having a really strange problem here.  My macbook air running mountain lion locked on me so i held the power button down to restart it.  When it restarted, the OS offered to reopen the apps I had running.  I declined.  Now I cannot run any of those apps.  Even reinstalling the apps didn't help.  I can still run apps that weren't running at the time of the crash.  Thank you very much for the help!  h1BBEDIT/h1  precodeProcess:         BBEdit [2636] Path:            /Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/BBEdit Identifier:      com.barebones.bbedit Version:         10.5.2 (3264) App Item ID:     404009241 App External ID: 13641604 Code Type:       X86 (Native) Parent Process:  launchd [260] User ID:         501  Date/Time:       2013-03-12 11:11:26.219 -0400 OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.8.2 (12C60) Report Version:  10  Interval Since Last Report:          1301 sec Crashes Since Last Report:           137 Per-App Interval Since Last Report:  1001440 sec Per-App Crashes Since Last Report:   3 Anonymous UUID:                      79A755BF-CD40-3FAA-AD9C-722A60F522FE  Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: EXC_I386_GPFLT  VM Regions Near 0xc594:     __PAGEZERO             0000000000000000-0000000000001000 [    4K] ---/--- SM=NUL  /Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/BBEdit --&gt;

Furthermore, the odds that your two apps are both causing problems is a very low likelihood, so you could do two more quick steps to make sure it's not an easy fix.  ul liMake a new user account, turn off automatic user log in at boot, and log out of your current account. Log in to the new account and test the two crashing apps. If they don't crash, you've strongisolated the problem to your user account data, state and preferences/strong./li liShut down the Mac and start up in Safe Mode. Log in to the new account, test the apps. Log out and log in to your normal account (still in safe mode) and test the apps./li /ul  Safe Mode will let you know if third party or optional Apple software is conflicting with the apps.  At this point, you'll have narrowed down three new situations that you didn't cover and have a very good idea if you need to reinstall the OS or just clear things systematically from your user account (or back up files and then restore your user account settings and preferences from a backup before the crashes started).  Once you've cornered the issue - you'll have a better feeling for how to fix things and get back to using apps rather than troubleshooting them.  <comment98238> Have you tried clearing the Saved Application State folder? <comment98298> I did clear that folder out, but its still crashing.  I've read about permission issues on folders after crashes that can cause this as well. <comment98484> Have you repaired your disk using Disk Utility? Try fixing permissions as well - that may help
