Removing archived messages from Mail app in Mavericks <body> I've noticed that I have just over 20GB worth of archived messages on my SSD eating valuable space. I suspect it is the attachments that is taking the majority of it. Is there a way to stop archiving the attachments while retaining the messages? or if not how can I stop archiving the messages as a whole?  <comment140914> It is possible, if you could tell us what is your setting for where to download/save the attachements.
