Now code/bin/chmod 1775 //code. At last code/bin/sync/code,then codeexit/code.    This will check your filesystem integrity and correct permissions for your root directory.  <answer108380> Check that root's UID is actually 0 on your system: codesudo id -u/code should print 0.  This wasn't the case on my system after updating to Mavericks. If it isn't, you can do the following to fix it:  ul liboot into single user mode/li lichange to code/private/var/db/dslocal/nodes/Default/users/code/li licheck that root's UID is wrong in coderoot.plist/code using codeplutil -p root.plist/code/li liif it is wrong, start by making a backup: codecp root.plist root.plist.orig/code/li liconvert the plist to xml format using codeplutil -fmt xml1 root.plist/code/li liuse your favorite editor to change the number after code&lt;key&gt;uid&lt;/key&gt;/code to code0/code/li liconvert the plist back to binary format using codeplutil -fmt binary1 root.plist/code/li /ul  <answer116298> The UID of root on your system was: 217 _krbtgt (Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket)     There IS a user called _krbtgt (Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket) in   /System/Library/DirectoryServices/DefaultLocalDB/Default/users,   that indeed is user 217.   supMore information: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24414669#24414669/sup  <comment125659> It seems that MacPorts has issues with Mavericks. See [this]( http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/107092/opt-insufficient-permissions) question. Are you [migrating](http://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration) or is this a new installation? <comment125669> its a new installation, i compiled on mavericks. <comment125672> Which guide did you follow? Have you installed Xcode or Xcode command line utilities? <comment125673> [Guide](http://www.macports.org/install.php)  I have installed xcode 5.01 with command line utilities. I think theres something wrong with permissions. as you can see in my original post, any ideas? <comment125676> please provide the output of `ls -l /opt`. Did you try to uninstall everything(xcode+command line tools and macports) and then install it again? If you don't need macports specifically, I'd recommend [brew](http://brew.sh/). I know, it is not the perfect solution but I assuming it is a bug of MacPorts(seeing the rising questions from other users) and you are not able to do anything right now. <comment125682> /opt does not exist. let us ignore macports for a moment. i am even not able to do 'sudo mkdir /test' 'mkdir: /test: Permission denied' i think something with the system is wrong. output of "ls -la" of / [/ output](http://pastebin.com/embed_iframe.php?i=A28ebaan) <comment125695> Well, try the following: Reboot into single user mode, this is archieved by holding down alt(option) + s while rebooting. At the prompt `/sbin/fsck -fy`(careful, QWERTZ-Layout), after that type `/sbin/mount -wu`. Now `/bin/chmod 1775 /`. At last `/bin/sync`,then `exit`. This will check your filesystem integrity and correct permissions for your root directory. <comment125771> Thanks, I'll try this when I'am back home. <comment125831> Perfect, that solved the problem. Now I'am able to install MacPorts as well. ;)
