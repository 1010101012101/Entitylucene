Turn off Lock Screen notifications completely, notifications keeps showing even when disabled <body> How can i disable completely the notifications from appearing in the lock screen? I unchecked these options:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/n6LXaDH.png" alt="accessWhenLocked" title="here i disabled the notifications on lockscreen"  But i'm STILL getting an abstract of every notification in the lockscreen so people who don't have my password can still read my chats and emails.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/AMyiXmx.png" alt="accessWhenLocked" title="here you can still see the f****** notifications"  This is very annoying, help please.  <answer159337> What you're trying to do is actually quite simple, but you will have to do it individually for each app. First, make sure you have the latest release of iOS 8 (this is not completely necessary, but recommended). Next, go to the Settings app and scroll down until you find the application you want to disable notifications for on the lock screen.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rGNL6.jpg" alt="Settings Application Cell"  Now, click that cell and scroll down on the presented screen for "Notifications"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fSBFU.jpg" alt="App Settings Screen"  Now, on this screen there is a slide that says "Show in Lock Screen". Disable this (like this):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YHq00.jpg" alt="Disable &quot;Show in Lock Screen"  Now you're finished! Let me know if this does not work for any reason.  <comment187429> Thanks, that solved my issue. It's a pretty awful lock screen configuration...
