After Lion installation, Safari occasional unresponsive, won't take input <body> Since installing Lion, I've had Safari 5.1 become unresponsive to input several times on two different machines (both iMacs, in different locations).   I don't see anything in the forums I quickly checked. Any ideas?  (Safari becomes responsive again after quitting and restarting. Input device -- mouse, trackpad -- makes no difference.)  <answer21400> Try completely clearing out Safari of junk.  First, empty the cache by hitting strongemSafari  Empty Cache.../em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7M7Yu.png" alt="empty cache"  Click strongemEmpty/em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/APoc9.png" alt="are you sure"  Then completely reset Safari by hitting strongemSafari  Reset Safari/em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/apXXg.png" alt="reset"  Check all the checks and hit strongemReset/em/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rO8mC.png" alt="sure reset"  Then quit and relaunch Safari. That should speed things up.  If not, you can always use another browser. ^cough^Chrome^cough^  <answer25468> Has nothing to do with resetting anything or emptying any cache. Ignorance of mouse clicks is a Mac OS X 10.7 bug which seems to occur on older Macs and should be addressed by Apple.  <comment23488> Trying this now. Thanks for the suggestions. <comment45181> This problem effects newer Macs as well. I have a brand new MacBook Pro and experience random text input freezes when using safari.
