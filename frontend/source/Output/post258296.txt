How to check Raw Files in my iCloud Drive? <body> I would like to see all my raw files in my iCloud Drive.  I tried going to https://www.icloud.com/#iclouddrive and code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code, but there’re only the “official, ordered and clean” iCloud Drive folder.  From the iCloud preference panel, I can see every app that stores something in my iCloud Drive, but I can’t see what they store.  Is there a complete way to check my iCloud Drive?  EDIT: This is what I mean by “Raw Files”:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lZjLa.png" alt="iCloud Drive"  <answer258308> The only way I know of to achieve this is by creating a symbolic link to your emiCloud Drive/em folder. Open a strongTerminal/strong window and enter the following:  codeln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents ~/Desktop/iCloud\ Drive/code  This will place a symbolic link to your emiCloud Drive/em on your desktop. You may move it wherever you please.  Starting with strongEl Capitan/strong, trying to navigate to that folder using the  kbdCmd  ⌘/kbdkbdShift ⇧/kbdkbdG/kbd shortcut takes you instead to em~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/em. Incidentally, that is the same location that the strongFavorites/strong shortcut points to.  Do note that opening most of these folders will take you to em~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/em. However, you can expand them to inspect their contents in strongList View/strong.  This comes in handy when troubleshooting certain iCloud synchronization issues, such as (in my case), strongText Replacements/strong not making it to my Mac.
