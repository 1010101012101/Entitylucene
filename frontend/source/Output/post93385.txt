Can spotlight locate/find files in a VM, specifically Outlook 2010? <body> I run Windows 7 via Parallels 8 on my MBA running OS X10.8.4.  Is there a way to configure spotlight to locate/find contacts or emails in Outlook? Spotlight finds other VM created files such as Word, Excel or PPT, but doesn't register emails or contacts within Outlook. Thoughts?  Thanks-  FH  <answer93396> It is definitely possible, but you will need to write your own Spotlight Metadata importer for Outlook database, because there is none.  Difficulty level: HARD  Here is documentation https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/MDImporters/MDImporters.html  <comment109583> I got it wrong :( <comment109713> Thank you. The process is beyond my scope, I'll just stick with searching via Outlook directly.
