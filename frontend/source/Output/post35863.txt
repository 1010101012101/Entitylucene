How do I recall the last sent message in Colloquy? <body> In many chat clients you can get the last typed message by hitting the up arrow. It doesn't seem to work in this client. Is that not an available feature or is there some way to do it?  <answer35875> Per Colloquy's FAQ:     strongIs there a way to see my sent history as well as to navigate around in the existing text with the arrow keys?/strongbr   Sent history is controlled by the up/down arrow keys while holding option, switching between panes in a window with command-up/down, and scrolling with home/end/page up/page down; you can use any other key combination to navigate or select text. Change this within the hidden preferences.   So; kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2191;/kbd or  kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2193;/kbd gives you the last, or next message, respectively.  And per that Hidden Preferences link, it would appear that you can change it to use up/down arrows only by opening codeTerminal.app/code (either search for codeTerminal/code via Spotlight, otherwise you can find the app in codeApplications &gt; Utilities/code), and enter:  codedefaults write info.colloquy JVSendHistoryUsesOnlyArrows -bool true/code  Restart Colloquy after entering this command if it was already open, and see if that works.  <answer35877> kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2191;/kbd gives you the last message.  kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2193;/kbd gives you the next message.
