Monodevelop on OS X and Displaying UTF-8 <body> Does using Copy or paste cause monodevelop to crash, or is it just me? If you have Monodevelop installed, please can you test this, I fount that both shortcuts and from the menus cause it to crash. I seem unable to find information about this on google, though would personally consider this quite a major bug.  And how can UTF-8 characters be displayed in monodevelop and mono programs? Although they output fine in Terminal. It is similar to this post , but none of the solutions seem relevant as 2.4 has now been released.  <comment3130> Duplicate of [Monodevelop on OS X and Displaying UTF-8](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4009728/monodevelop-on-os-x-and-displaying-utf-8) on Stack Overflow. <comment3135> Yes, i added it there but forgot to put it here, thanks, as i'm not sure on the best way to ask questions. <comment23434> It is definitely not just you. I experienced the exact same problem when copying and pasting in MonoDevelop. It bugged me so much that I stopped using Mono altogether. I am back using Bootcamp, VMware, Windows and Visual Studio. I tried with the latest builds under Snow Leopard and this issue was never resolved. Good luck!
