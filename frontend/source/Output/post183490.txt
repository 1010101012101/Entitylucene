iTunes U plays previous video when trying to open reading material <body> I'm having a strange problem with iTunes U (in iTunes). When I click on a non-video item in the lecture feed, it simply plays the last video.br The item I'm trying to view is clearly not a video, as indicated by the book-symbol:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/siyeE.png" alt="enter image description here"  But in this example, when I click em"Reading: The Rest of Swift"/em, it simply plays em"9. Scroll View and Multithreading"/em.  I'm using a mac running OSX Yosemite, so there shouldn't be any problems with that.br Why is this happening then?  <answer184731> The solution seems to be to first download the item, and then it will open properly.
