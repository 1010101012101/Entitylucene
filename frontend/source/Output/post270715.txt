High CPU usage while idle <body> I found my 2012 MBA quite frequently has loud fan noises due to some app using high CPU even while doing nothing. Apps or processes include codemdsstore/code, codekernel_task/code, Safari on some site that doesn't really have a lot of Javascript. This puzzles me.  The computer is rarely as completely silent as it used to be. I realize it has to do Spotlight indexing (codemdsstore/code) but is that so CPU intensive to make the fan so loud? Is there an underlying problem that could be solved by a clean reinstall? Is the fan simply full of dust?  I tried searching for ways to clean the fan but it appears you have to take the computer apart to properly clean it and Im too afraid to do that.  Also is the constant heat up through the CPU bad for the long term battery life?  <comment340284> Did you check this? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144474/mds-and-mds-stores-constantly-consuming-cpu Also you can clean your fans with compressed air
