How to to specify pronunciations for OS X Lion? <body> The text-to-speech function on Mac OS X Lion is quite good, although sometimes it misses the just-right pronunciation of a word.  Is there a way to specify a pronunciation for certain words or phrases in Lion?  For example, let's say my friend's name is "Tony", and the voice for OS X (Alex) pronounces Tony "tooney". Is there a way that I can set Tony to be pronounced the same way Alex pronounces "Toe Nee"?  <answer46554> Open strongApplications  Services  VoiceOver Utility/strong and go to Speech  Pronunciation. Add a subsitution for "Tony" and tell it to pronounce it as "toe nee".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMYqe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Interestingly, my computer running 10.7.3 with the Alex voice pronounces Tony correctly. Because of this, I wasn't able to test this solution, so it may not work.  <answer152875> You can also use code[[inpt PHON]]/code:  precode [[inpt PHON]]_t1OW ~n2EY.[[inpt TEXT]] /code/pre  See the Speech Synthesis Programming Guide.  If you download the Auxiliary Tools for Xcode package from https://developer.apple.com/downloads, you can use the Repeat After Me application to convert text to the phonetic syntax:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iUPQ2.png" alt=""  <comment53221> Type it phonetically? <comment53243> Brilliant, exactly what I was looking for. My computer pronounces it fine too, just using that as an example. Cheers! <comment53269> Ah, I missed that somehow. There's also some hidden app somewhere I was *just using* to manipulate the exact phonetics of words, and I'm really annoyed that I can't find it anywhere! <comment61510> This doesn't seem to work for the terminal. Try running "say tony" in the terminal, and you wont get your new pronunciation.... and ideas on how to make this happen? <comment179913> This is a great answer. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. Is there something I am missing? Some command to set my changes? I tried closing applications and reopening them, then I tried restarting the computer, but it has no effect. (I am running OSX 10.8.5 on my Mac.) <comment316242> The voice over utility only impacts how voice over service handles pronunciations, it unfortunately does not affect the text-to-speech service (including the `say` command in terminal)
