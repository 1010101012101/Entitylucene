iOS 9 push not working for Mail app <body> I am using a iPhone 16GB on iOS 9.0.2. I have always been using the default Mail app for emails. Since, iOS 8, the push used to work perfectly. On iOS 9, the push is delayed by quite a while. Sometimes, I don't even receive the notification on the notification menu, and it's just the notification sound that I hear.  I have properly verified bALL/b the possible setting regarding the Push, and the Mail, and the notification menu settings and nothing there seems to indicate that I am doing anything wrong. Again, these settings have been simply taken over from iOS 8. So, if these settings held good for 8, I guess that they should be good for 9 as well.  Any suggesstions?  <comment256671> Not working on iOS 9.1 as well.
