What is the partition size needed for The Mavericks install disk? <body> I will setup a USB key to install Mavericks.  I would like to know the needed size of the partition to install Mavericks.  <answer106094> The Mavericks install app is about 5.3GB and it is compressed. That should be how much space it will take up on a USB stick. Just drop the installer on the stick and double click on the installer to install.  <answer106116> For me, the Mavericks partition uses 5.36 GB (5,355,311,104 Bytes) (per Disk Utility).  That's 4.98 GB in old-school "binary" types like me (4.98 GiB).  This is subject to change given partition overhead, block size, a Mavericks version.  So I'd allocate a little more to the partition.  <answer110837> I have partitioned my 64 GB USB stick into two parts, one being em5 361 369 088 b/em large out of which em5 951 488 b/em is free after making it Mavericks installation disk.  <comment124696> This is very close to my own results. <comment125019> the recommended is 8GB
