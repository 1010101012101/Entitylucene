Location-based external monitor profiles for MacBook running Mavericks <body> Is it possible to configure multiple monitor profiles for a MacBook (2011 Air) running Mavericks? I move my MacBook between home and work, and due to my desk layouts, the MacBook is placed to the left of my home monitor and to the right of my work monitor. This means that I have to either remember to move the mouse pointer off the wrong side of the screen in one location, or open display preferences and change the arrangement every time I move the MacBook.  Ideally I'd like it to auto-detect the location (easily determined via the network) and adjust the arrangement accordingly. If that option doesn't exist, something that allowed me to define two profiles and switch between them from the menu bar would be close enough.  <comment139570> I've also got two monitors at work and one at home, if that changes anything.
