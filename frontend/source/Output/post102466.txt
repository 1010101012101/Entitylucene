Does Java come pre-installed on Mac OS X 10.7/10.8 and beyond? <body> Does Java (the JDK) come pre-installed with Macs on OS X 10.7/10.8 and beyond? I am hearing Apple is going to stop shipping Java with 10.8 and beyond but I couldn't find any link to confirm it/deny it.  <answer102468> The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with 10.8, but the Java Development Kit (JDK) is not - that you'll need to install yourself.  <answer102548> Apple did stop shipping Java as of 10.7 and higher. Neither the JDK nor the JRE come preinstalled. However, the first time you emneed/em a JRE, Mac OS X will offer to download and install it for you (via the Software Update mechanism).  Similarly, codejavac/code is stubbed in a base OS X install and will trigger the install process.  Note that the Apple JRE/JDK is Java 1.6â€”if you need 1.7 or 1.8, you'll need to get it yourself from Oracle.  <comment120633> Could you provide a link from Apple or any sort of confirmation? <comment120703> @user220755 this is just from personal experience looking at what's installed on my computer.
