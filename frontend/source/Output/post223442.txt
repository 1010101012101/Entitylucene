Issue installing BasicTeX with Cask under OS X <body> I followed the instructions (that I could understand) to install BasicTeX from Cask and this was the output I got:  precodebasictex staged at '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/basictex/latest' (107M) /code/pre  I see this:  precode○ → ls -l /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/basictex/latest/ total 219936 -rw-r--r--  1 sunitjoshi  admin  112605547 Jan 13 07:28 BasicTeX.pkg /code/pre  And this under ~/Applications; i.e. no BasicText.app  precode○ → ls ~/Applications/ Chrome Apps.localized emacs                 test.js /code/pre  Am I missing something here?  <answer236045> strongTLDR;/strong Add code/usr/local/texlive/2015basic/bin/universal-darwin/code to your codePATH/code.  There is no codeBasicTeX.app/code. BasicTex is now installed at code/usr/local/texlive/2015basic/code, wether you use Brew Cask or not (you can also find something files at code/Library/Tex/code, but that's just a bunch of symlinks pointing to the actual installation directory). Just add the above path to your codePATH/code and you should be fine.
