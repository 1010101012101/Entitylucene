Mail Connection Doctor still attempting to access deleted Mail accounts <body> I was testing some email servers and added several email accounts to my Mac. I deleted these accounts afterwards.  Now I have only three base accounts in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet Accounts/code: Facebook, Twitter and iCloud.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sp5IX.png" alt="System Preference Internet Accounts"  However, strongMail Connection Doctor/strong (codeWindow &gt; Connection Doctor/code) still attempts to access the deleted accounts; if one of them has invalid credentials or settings it reports "Mail can't connect to the account."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/80se2.png" alt="Connection Doctor"  Where these accounts are stored and can I permanently remove them so the Mail Connection Doctor doesn't try to connect?  <answer212921> These accounts are stored in strongKeychain Access/strong application and in servers list. To remove these accounts permanently, do following:  ol liOpen (Mail  Preferences  Accounts)/li liSelect "Edit SMTP server list" from "Outgoing Mail Server" menu/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aoCcw.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liEdit server list/li /ol  Then remove accounts from strongKeychain Access/strong:  ol liClose strongMail/strong/li liOpen strongKeychain Access/strong/li liSelect "login" in codeKeychains/code section/li liSelect "Passwords" in codeCategory/code section/li liType deleted account name in Search field/li /ol  There should appear several records, but you need only codecom.apple.account.SMTP.xxx/code and/or codecom.apple.account.IMAP.xxx/code entries with "application password" in Kind column.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f50Qj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Select and delete them. Open strongMail/strong and check Connection Doctor. There must remain only existing accounts.  <answer262023> I followed the instructions on this and found the items to delete but still had the request for password on deleted account. went back to the beginning and found that one of my new accounts(google) for some reason was using the deleted accounts(btinternet) outgoing server. I deleted (google) and reinstated it and all is now working. thanks for the blog.
