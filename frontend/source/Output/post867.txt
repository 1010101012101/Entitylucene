How can I unpack a .deb on Mac OS X without installing it?  <body> I have a .deb file that I want to unpack and examine, but not install. I'm currently looking for where i can download dpkg for OSX, but can't find it. If you have a link, please share.  <answer868> You can install dpkg using MacPorts or just download the sources.  <answer869> if you use Darwin Port (now name it Mac Port) you can install dpkg and more package (like do it in debian or ubuntu).  after install Darwin Port go and install dpkg from here.  also you can find more info about dpkg in osx here.  <answer872> codear/code is already installed on my mac on OS X. So just do  precodear -x path/to/deb/file.deb /code/pre  that's it. No need to install other software.  <comment723> @Am1rr3zA - Thanks for adding the tags. I need +7 more reputation before I'm able to lol. <comment725> Thanks for the reply. This is actually the method I used. <comment726> +1 for the reply. I couldn't get DarwinPort download page to load so I just used MacPorts. Thanks! <comment727> @Thomas, MacPorts, formerly called DarwinPorts <comment736> DarwinPorts.com is a rip off of MacPorts.org. MacPorts.org used to be at DarwinPorts.org - see http://trac.macports.org/wiki/DarwinPortsFraud <comment102411> Users of XCode 4 can run `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/ar`. <comment102439> @zpletan Why not `/usr/bin/ar` ? <comment102553> `ar` comes from XCode (unless you installed it with MacPorts/Homebrew/etc), but XCode 4 comes from the App Store and therefore doesn't install anything in /usr/bin by default. I think you can change it from preferences, but that's the default. <comment102591> @zpletan I've never installed anything in `/usr/bin`, so `ar` must be from the default installation. (Unless I am totally mistaken.) <comment102595> @zpletan I've just checked: `/usr/bin/ar` is installed via the package `DeveloperToolsCLI`, which is probably an optional install (but I wonder where I chose to install these tools) <comment102758> All I know is, I followed the Internet's instructions to uninstall v3 and then installed v4, and now I can only get to it via the path I posted. Like I said, I think there is an optional install in prefs that puts all XCode's stuff in /usr/bin, but it's optional.
