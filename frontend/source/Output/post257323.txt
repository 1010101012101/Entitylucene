Another terminal + vim color question <body> So I've read countless posts on this and been trying on and off for several days, but just can't figure out what's wrong and feel like this can't be so difficult. All I'm trying to do is get the solarized colorscheme working in default terminal and vim console on macOS Sierra. I don't know if Sierra made the old instructions I'm finding obsolete, but they don't seem to work.  I tried many different combinations of steps, but here is where I'm at right now:  downloaded codeSolarized.term/code and codeSolarized.vim/code.  Opened codeSolarized.term/code, opened terminal preferences, saved as default  put into code~/.vimrc/code:  precode" Solarized Dark syntax enable set t_Co=256 let g:solarized_termcolors=256 set background=dark colorscheme solarized /code/pre  Now this is what my terminal and vim look like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uSajV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please someone save me from this ugliness!  <answer263311> I just setup my MacOS Terminal and Vim to use solarized and was hitting this same issue with the same .vimrc settings.  I don't think the terminal colours and vim colours are having an effect on each other but rather the colour settings in .vimrc aren't quite right.  My ~/.vimrc literally only contains this now:  precodesyntax on set background=dark colo solarized /code/pre  And using vim with a c++ file in terminal looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8lneE.png" alt="enter image description here" Also worth noting that my custom vim colour file 'solarized.vim' is in code~/.vim/colors//code (which was a folder I had to create)  -Hobsie  <comment321280> What do you want help with here? The Terminal colors or vim's colors? They're independent. One doesn't depend on the other. <comment321282> I guess both. but It seems like they do depend on each other, or at least vim depends on terminals colors or settings in some way, because when I change one the other is affected.
