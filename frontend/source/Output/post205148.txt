Where to find app which opens on startup, but it's not in Users & Groups? <body> I've this annoying application popping up on startup (called ZipCloud) which seems to be installed without my knowledge (along with other app) and I wanted to get rid of it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/voE7Lm.png" alt="annoying ZipCloud pop-up"  I understand I can uninstall it by dragging the app into Trash. However before doing that, I wanted to understand where the app added it-self to the startup scripts.  I've already checked in System Preferences (Users &amp; Groups), but it's not there. I also check my code/etc/rc.local/code. And the app it-self doesn't have any options to get rid of the startup.  What other places I can look to get rid of unwanted startup apps?  <comment247382> Look in ~/LaunchAgents <comment247386> LaunchAgents can be found in /Library/LaunchAgents, you may also want to check /Library/LaunchDaemons <comment247395> Sorry ~/Library/LaunchAgents <comment247399> @Mark You're correct, found the file at: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.jdibackup.ZipCloud.autostart.plist`.
