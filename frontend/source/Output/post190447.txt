Changing the keyboard layout (NOT language) based on the input language <body> I have a Japanese keyboard Macbook running Yosemite.  The input languages (sources) are Japanese and English.  While the input language is Japanese, I want the keyboard layout to be Japanese (this is how it is by default, but I don't want to change this).  While the input language is English, I want to use a standard QWERTY layout (in other words, the code;/code key should be code;/code/code:/code (like QWERTY), not code;/code/code+/code (like Japanese layout).  How can I change the keyboard layout when I change the input language?  <answer190542> Have you added the desired keyboards under codeSystem preferences -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Input Sources/code? If yes you can change the layout of input source pressing: kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd.   <comment226269> I think you missed the point.  When you have a JIS hardware keyboard, the US input source puts things on different keys then when you have a US or European hardware keyboard.  That is what he wants to fix. <comment226270> You could try using text replacements in system prefs/keyboard/text.  Otherwise I think you would have to create a custom layout with Ukelele or a similar program that modifies the JIS version of the US layout to work the way you want. <comment226328> Yes, what @TomGewecke said is what I am trying to fix.
