Lightweight Audio Waveform Viewer <body> I'm doing a large amount of music library updating and de-duplicating and evaluating, and I would like a piece of software that would allow me to quickly be able to view a waveform of a selected audio file.  I currently use Fission for editing, but it loads slower than I would like, and I have no need for the actual editing aspect of the software. Additionally, Garageband is antagonistically slow and too hard to examine the waveform like I would like.  Is there software, or maybe something like a QuickLook plugin, that would allow me to select an audio file, and quickly get a rendered version of the waveform data within the file?  Loudness levels labels are appreciated, but not required.  <answer22928> It's not a Quick Look plugin, but Sound Studio it is fairly lightweight, and displays the waveform:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sAIhE.png" alt=""  However, I'm afraid I don't think you'll find the waveform itself to be particularly useful for determining duplicate songs.  <answer22938> Try Audacity.  It doesn't seem to heavyweight for just waveform viewing.  <answer83624> Checkout Snapper 2 from Audio Ease:  http://www.audioease.com/Pages/Snapper/SnapperMain.html#  I was looking for the same thing but this is the only all-in-one, finder level waveform viewer I could find.  <answer168407> The 'lightest' app I've found to see a waveform is Nulloy  http://nulloy.com/  But I wish there were a Quick Look plugin.  <comment25604> Audacity is free. I don't find it all that well-designed or useful, but if all you want to do is view waveforms, why not give it a try? http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ <comment356082> Anything newer & better? <comment356083> Good, but been buggy for me for years.
