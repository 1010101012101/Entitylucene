Mac App Store cannot recognise already installed apps <body> I have some issues with my Mac App Store. I had to download again the codeKeynote/code app through the Mac App Store. However, when I download it, it works fine, but when I search for this specific app again in the Map App Store, it says "Install". I can install it as many times as I want and I can run it normally, but that should not be the case. It should say "Open" in the Mac App Store, instead of "Install", right?
