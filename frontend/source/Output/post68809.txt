How to batch rename images, in reverse numerical order? <body> My camera names its images IMG_0001.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0003.jpg, etc.  I have about a thousand images and would like to rename them without having to do it manually if possible.   Is there a good way to automate the process of renaming them in the reverse order - e.g. IMG_0003.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0001.jpg?   <answer68810> Try this in the Terminal:  precodemkdir new ls IMG* &gt; 1 sort -r &lt; 1 &gt; 2 paste 1 2 | awk '{ print "mv " $1 " new/" $2} ' &gt; 3 . 3 /code/pre  The renamed files will be in the codenew/code folder.  Here is a brief explanation of how this works: it creates a script named code3/code that does the renaming. For that, it creates a listing of the images in alphabetical order in code1/code and in reverse order in code2/code. Then one line is read from each file and combine into a codemv/code command, which is executed when you run code3/code. The images are renamed into the codenew/code folder to avoid collisions.  <answer68821> You can use an Automator Workflow.   Something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/piNKD.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongSort Finder Items/strong step will sort image names descending (IMG_0003.jpg, IMG_002.jpg, IMG_001.jpg).   strongMake Sequential/strong step will rename them sequentially (IMG_0001.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, ...).  strongCopy Finder Items/strong step is optional, just to be sure not to mess with original files.  <answer68854> Name Mangler ($10 and has a free trial) or Name Changer (free/donationware) is also very good for this sort of thing if you're after a nice, simple app.  <answer68903> Here's another shell script. You can save it as a normal text file and then run codebash /path/to/script.sh/code from Terminal. Remove the codeecho/code to actually rename the files.  precodecd ~/Pictures/ IFS=$'\n' # the input field separators include space by default i=1 for f in $(ls -r IMG*.jpg); do      echo mv "$f" "IMG_$(printf %04d $i)".jpg     (( i++ )) done /code/pre  <answer68907> You can use the perl rename.pl script looming around the web (for example, from here), and put it into the folder with your image files.  Its usage is simple and documented and it is pretty powerful. To use it for your case, replace codeMAXIMUM_NUMBER/code by the number in the last photo, then run:  precodeperl rename.pl 's/IMG_0+(\d+)/"A_IMG_".sprintf("%04d",(MAXIMUM_NUMBER- $1))/xe' *.jpg &amp;&amp; perl rename.pl 's/A_//' *.jpg /code/pre  To explain:  ol liThe first rename (before &amp;&amp;) will rename all files to MAXIMUM_NUMBER minus the number already in the file name. It will also prefix the filename with codeA_/code in order to avoid overwriting already existing files./li liThe second rename simply deletes the codeA_/code from the file names./li /ol  Note that the rename.pl script can do much more than that if you ever need more complex renaming.  <comment80005> My personal favorite is A Better Finder Rename http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/6322/a-better-finder-rename <comment80006> Consider explaining what each step of the script does <comment80011> @HairoftheDog, done. Thanks for the nudge. <comment80070> The answser lhf gavin was right, but before step 5, you should exec `chmod +x 3` first. <comment81203> Did you get an answer to your question?
