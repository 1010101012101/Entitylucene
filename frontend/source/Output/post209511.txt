iOS Calendar Adding Its Own Alerts <body> I am using a Google account on latest iOS, and the Calendar app appears to be adding it's own alerts to all-day events:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nPQIvm.png" alt="example of ios bug"br supClick to enlarge images/supbr Yes, I checked the "default alerts" in Settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6LIgm.png" alt="default alerts"br supClick to enlarge images/supbr And even confirmed Google Calendar doesn't have the alerts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QjoNBm.png" alt="google calendar"br supClick to enlarge images/supbr So... what gives? I've also tried deleting the entire Google account from my iPhone and re-adding it. No joy. It's driving me bonkers. Perhaps it's a bug with iOS 9.0.2, or something I'm just not understanding. Is anyone else having this issue/know a fix?  <answer210512> Do you use strongApple Calendar/strong on your Mac? (Preferences - Alerts). Perhaps these are the preferences that push those alerts to your iPhone.  <comment253959> Are there any other apps that sync with your Google Calendar? Maybe some other app is fetching events, adding alert to them and syncing back too Google. <comment253963> @Behdad if it's something like that, I would expect the changes to be getting sync'd back to my Google Calendar. They're not. They only are showing up on my iPhone under the native calendar app.
