Where on my pc does iTunes store the backup? <body> I backup my phone to iTunes but need to back up my pc.  I can do pictures as I can just copy those from the phone but what about the contacts, texts etc that are backed up to iTunes? Where is that stored?  <answer96626> From Locate backups of your iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch:     iTunes places the backup files in the following places:      ul   listrongMac:/strong code~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup//code/li   listrongWindows XP:/strong code\Documents and Settings\(username)\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/code      strongNote:/strong To quickly access the Application Data folder, click strongStart/strong, and choose strongRun/strong. Type strong%appdata%/strong and click strongOK/strong./li   listrongWindows Vista, 7, 8, 10:/strong code\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\/code      strongNote:/strong To quickly access the AppData folder, click strongStart/strong. In the search bar, type strong%appdata%/strong and press the kbdstrongâ†© Return/strong/kbd key./li   /ul   <answer105726> For Windows 7 &amp; 8 (from my knowledge):  ul liStart iTunes and attach the iPhone./li liClick on your phone icon and then select the strongInfo/strong tab on the top menu./li liNote the drop down menu SYNC CONTACTS WITH./li liChoose Windows Contacts./li liMake sure everything else is unchecked./li liThen go ahead sync your phone./li liThis creates and or updates a Contacts Folder in your Windows User's folder called Contacts./li liThe info in here looks similar to a file but the columns show contact info./li liSelect an entry and OPEN IT (double click or right click and choose open.) - An edit window opens. When you sync the Windows Contact folder and your iPhone you will be able to get a pretty cool reconciliation feature for the differences between the two lists./li liThis works well and I know I have my contacts on my computer and backed up with all my other stuff./li /ul  <comment113444> I gather than you are not supposed to say thank you particularly on here but thank you so much.  I can now replace my hard drive after the backup of the backup!  :) <comment113451> Are you asking about the location on a Windows computer? <comment117423> @madfish If the answer helped you achieve what is necessary, vote it up and tick it as being correct. <comment261040> Just a note that on my Mac, these files are split apart and named in a way that they're not human-readable. <comment333924> What about windows 10
