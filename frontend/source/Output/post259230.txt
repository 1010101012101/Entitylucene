Itunes Smart Playlist Podcast with no common name <body> I have a smart playlist I've been using for some time to sort one particular podcast by oldest episode first, and has (0) plays. This allowed me to listen to them in order and have it remove them once I'd listened to them.  This worked great till recently. The producer has decided to stop putting their name in title and start titling it by episode number and a description of the episode.  Now my smart playlist isn't grabbing them, because it's filling itself by podcast, name contains, played zero times. Is there a way to fill the smart playlist by the name of the show instead of part of the title. I've been playing with the options and can't get anything to work. Thanks for the help.  <comment324349> I'm not sure off the top of my head about the answer to your Smart Playlist issue, but you can use the regular iTunes Podcast section to do exactly what you're describing. Each podcast is listed on the left. Click on a podcast, then click the gear icon across from it's name (toward the far right of the window). You can change settings for the order in which they are played (oldest to newest), sorted (same), and setting Delete Played Episodes to On will cause them to be deleted 24 hours after they are played. (In the meantime they're moved to the bottom of the list to avoid confusion.)
