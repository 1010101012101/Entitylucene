This content can't be played on this Apple TV <body> Just watched strongemSuits/strong - S6; E13./em I bought the season pass a while ago. Went to watch the next episode - emS6; E14,/em but got the following error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LCHGGl.jpg" alt="This content can&#39;t be played on this Apple TV."     This content can't be played on this Apple TV.     Why / why not?  Skipped ahead to the episode after that one - emS6; E15,/em  which is working fine.  What's going on?  <answer282105> Just got off the phone with Apple support. Resolved by SettingsAppsITunes Movies and TV ShowsQuick Start and switched to off.   <comment354904> My first thought would be it's a temporary problem at Apple's end. If it persists (say for 24hrs) then I'd contact Apple directly about it.
