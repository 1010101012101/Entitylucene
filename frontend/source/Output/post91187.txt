Updating to Snow Leopard through a USB optical drive <body> My optical drive on my Macbook Pro has gone out. I have a copy of Snow Leopard on a disc, if I borrow a USB optical drive, will I be able to install Snow Leopard and is this a reliable method? Thanks  <answer91190> Yes, this should work perfectly well. Almost all USB optical drives use standard drivers, so just about any one should work just fine with your MacBook Pro.
