Using cURL to download images in XML feed? <body> I have an XML file that has links to various .jpg I want to create an applescript that downloads a local copy of these. The idea is to also label them sequentially  with a number say 001 to 030.  Every time i run the script i want the pictures to be overwritten with the new ones.  Here is the XML file I need to use:  http://tweetriver.com/hud_ro/steer_filtered.xml?include_entities=1  Can anyone help?  <answer80993> If a shell script solution is acceptable as well, try the following  precode#!/bin/bash URL='http://tweetriver.com/hud_ro/steer_filtered.xml?include_entities=1' i=0 for u in $(curl -s "$URL" |            grep jpg |             sed -E 's/.*&lt;profile_image_url&gt;(.+)&lt;\/profile_image_url&gt;/\1/'); do     curl -s "$u" -o $i.jpg     (( i++ )) done /code/pre  This of course only works for this specific XML example and requires all files to be in jpg format.  <answer81008> Here is another approach:  precode-- Notice last "/" on path below set downloadFolder to "/Users/squirrel/Desktop/testFolder/"  set myImages to every paragraph of (do shell script "curl http://tweetriver.com/hud_ro/steer_filtered.xml?include_entities=1 | grep -o \\&gt;.*jpg | sed 's/\\&gt;//'")  repeat with i from 1 to count of myImages     set fileName to do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of (item i of myImages) &amp; " | grep -o [^/]*$ | sed 's/\\.jpg/-" &amp; addOs(i, 3) &amp; ".jpg/'"     do shell script "curl " &amp; quoted form of (item i of myImages) &amp; " -o " &amp; quoted form of (downloadFolder &amp; fileName as text) end repeat  on addOs(myNumber, desiredDigits)     set myNumber to myNumber as text     set moreOs to desiredDigits - (myNumber's length)     repeat moreOs times         set myNumber to "0" &amp; myNumber     end repeat     return myNumber end addOs /code/pre  <comment93465> Have you actually written any script for us to look at? Is there a language you should be implementing this script in?
