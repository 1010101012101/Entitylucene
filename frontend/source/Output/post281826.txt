Apple Mail refuses to accept correct login <body> After a hard disk crash and restore from Carbon Copy Cloner, Apple Mail refuses to accept known correct passwords. Connection Doctor logs say "Authentication aborted by client".   I have removed the Keychain. I have, successfully, logged in as a different user and made the account there.   Two other symptoms which may or may not be connected; 1. Internet Accounts will not delete or modify accounts 2. I can't log out of iCloud.   The accounts in Mail are a mixture. The two I'm focussing on are a Gmail account and a POP account. I have tried adding the accounts again.   I would even accept destroying all the accounts and importing them all again but I am unable to even do this.
