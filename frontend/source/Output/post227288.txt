Download Apple developer videos for offline usage <body> I would like to download Apple developer videos https://developer.apple.com/videos/ they release each year to watch them at double speed or to watch them offline. I am a registered developer with full access. Just right clicking and hitting download doesn't work. How can I do that?  <answer227295> Open the video from the intro page (e.g. WWDC 2015). At the bottom of each (streaming) video switch to "Resources" and download the linked HD/SD mp4 video:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nQ5ng.png" alt="enter image description here"  A developer account or an Apple ID is not needed.  <comment276053> oh, I feel stupid:D thank you
