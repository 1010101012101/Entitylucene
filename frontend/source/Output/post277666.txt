How to fix sudden and massive static & scratchiness on internal mic, on a MacBook Pro? <body> I know a similar question has been asked on this forum already, but I'm reposting my question as it may be slightly different and the previous answers do NOT solve the problem -  I have a circa 2012 Non-Retina Macbook Pro keyboard, and everything used to work just fine before I vacuumed the keyboard with my household vacuum cleaner about 10 days ago (something I've done for years on other computers without a problem, including my Dell PC laptop which I vacuumed the same day with no troubles). Yes I realize now that this might create an issue on the Macbook Pro, but who knew??  Ever since then, the internal mic (microphone) is basically useless - it now sometimes (not always) records clear sound for the first approx 30 seconds of any recording, whereafter it over-rules any recorded sound with terrible random hissing pops and scratchy static like the sound of papers being moved around against a mic creating extreme static. Other times it just has the static right from the start of the recording. So it's now useless for Skype or any online communications that require the internal mic.  I've tried the cold restart suggestion and resetting the SMC, makes no difference. Even tried plugging in an external mic, and that's not much better either.  HAVE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE online to try to find a solution. No joy. Really need to get this fixed ASAP, so any help appreciated, thank you!
