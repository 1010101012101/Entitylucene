Is there an app for iPhone to make pictures after a delay?  <answer48654> h2Self Timer/h2     Self Timer allows you to delay the shutter release, giving you time   between pushing the button and taking the actual photo. Once you push   the button, a beeping sound is emitted which becomes faster as the   moment of the shot approaches.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jFObj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
