How to open path in Double Commander from Terminal <body> If I type codeopen $(pwd)/code or codeopen /anypath//code I will get the path opened in Finder. How I can achieve similar results but with the path opening in Double Commander instead?  <answer221788> By default Double Commander is programmed to open with two Tabs each set to the current location of the Double Commander.app application bundle.  If one then changes to a different location other then the default on one of the Tabs and then closes Double Commander and reopens it, it opens to the last location before being closed.  Here's a way to open Double Commander to a specific path from the command line similar to opening Finder to a specific path using Terminal.  This covers the default of two Tabs.  Use the following emsyntax/em in a Terminal:  precodeopen -a Double\ Commander --args -path location ... /code/pre  Example:  precodeopen -a Double\ Commander --args -path ~/Documents /code/pre  This will open Double Commander to your Documents folder in the left Tab and the right Tab will open to the last location opened.  If you want to set the location of the both Tabs use:   precodeopen -a Double\ Commander --args -path location location /code/pre  Example:  precodeopen -a Double\ Commander --args -path / ~/Documents  /code/pre  This will open Double Commander to the root of the boot volume, typically Macintosh HD, in the left Tab and your Documents folder in the right Tab.  If there is a way to set just the right Tab while letting the left Tab default to the last saved location I do not know the emsyntax/em for it, if it's even doable.  I did try several attempts using different delimiters but none gave the wanted results in testing.
