No Audio on Windows 8.1 - iMac 2011 mid <body> I installed strongWindows 8 64bit/strong, via strongusb dongle/strong (efi boot) on BootCamp partition.  I notice the strongno audio problem/strong (there is a device called "strongHigh Definition Audio/strong" on system device that cant run properly and show code 10). I've already tried to install latest Realtek High definition audio codec, but still having this problem. Anybody had the same problem and resolve it?  I've an strongiMac 2011 mid/strong.   Thanx in advice  <comment344225> Sounds like a driver issue, have you ensured that Bootcamp installed the latest drivers correctly? <comment344267> It has been a while since I did this but if you open the bootcamp.app (right-click - reveal package contents) there will be a Windows ".exe" file there with the drivers in it. Copy that to your BootCamp partition and run it in windows, which should allow you to re-install the proper drivers <comment344401> I used the Bootcamp utility in OSX to create a bootcamp setup for windows on usb driver and i run it on windows. I don't try yet the suggest of Steve to obtain drivers from folder instead using bootcamp utility ... i will try and let you know. Thanx
