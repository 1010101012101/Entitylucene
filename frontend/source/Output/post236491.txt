Show contact name that save in outlook app as Caller ID? <body> I use outlook app on iPhone for work email/calender/contacts. The app is great however iPhone does not recognize incoming number that is matching a saved contact inside outlook app. So the phone only show the phone number instead of contact name.  is there any setting I need to enable?  Thanks, /S  <answer236493> I don't think the iPhone can use the contacts in Outlook app. However you can syncrhonize your contacts through iTunes :   ol liConnect your iPhone or iPod touch to your computer using the cable provided with your device or by placing the iPhone or iPod touch in the Apple Universal Dock/li liiTunes opens automatically when connected to your computer./li liIn iTunes, in the source list, under Devices, click the entry for your iPhone or iPod touch./li liClick the Info tab./li liUnder Contacts, click Sync contacts from, and then click Outlook./li /ol  Or you can try to add your contacts in your iPhone :  strongSettings/strong - strongMails Contacts, Calendar/strong - strongAdd an account/strong  And then just syncrhonize your contacts.  <comment289414> Thats what I thought...but want to post it here in case I missed any setting...I might have to add active sync to use the default contact app for my work contacts...
