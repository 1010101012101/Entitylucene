"Open With" ...running application option? <body> emThis may have been asked before but I couldn't find any reference to it./em  So Control-Click on a file brings up the context menu with "Open", "Open With.." and a number of other options. I often want to open a text based file in something other than the default application – for example, opening an codemxml/code (Flex) file in BBEdit. The default application for that is Flash Builder and I don't want to change the default.  Is there some kind of extension or service I can add to have an "Open with Running Application...(list of open applications)"?   Or if not that, a way a user (me!) can register an app to open certain file types, so for example, BBEdit is listed as an option for codemxml/code but is not the default?  <answer162509> Try to use automator. It's simple: create a new service with preferences (what items in which program to open). That's all - on right click menu there will be a new rule - "open in ...".  <answer162527> You could just drag the file onto the App icon in the Dock… em[which is very difficult to take a screenshot of…]/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DXDBZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  em[after comments…]/embr Alternatively, you could…     ul lidrag the file onto the app switcher - the one you bring up by pressing kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Tab ⇥  /kbd  /li /ul  or    ul liuse DragThing which has been a kind of substitute Dock since long before the Dock existed./li /ul  <answer162554> One way (which for just this is overkill but it has other benefits) is to use PathFinder as a replacement for Finder.   Its Open With... menu has submenus  ul liApplications - listing all apps it can find e.g. in /Applications ~/Applications/li liRunning - all running apps /li liText Editor - its copy of TextEdit /li liList of all apps that have registered for the extension/li /ul  <comment190055> This should be the answer _[not only for taking a screenshot whilst dragging chicken paprika onto the dock]_! Alternatively, you could drag the file onto the app switcher (the one you bring up by pressing cmd+tab). <comment190059> Nice. That one's new to me. I actually have always used [DragThing](http://www.dragthing.com/english/about.html) (since v1.0 in 1995 :-o ) so I automatically drag to that, out of habit. <comment190082> I do this but I have my dock on the side and on a double monitor system, it is very awkward to drag a Finder item to the dock using a trackpad. <comment190084> Then go with @Asmus alternative, which I shall sneakily ;) add to the answer <comment190085> I just realised that in the specific case of BBEdit you should already have "Open File in BBEdit" within the "Services" part of the context menu (at least I do) <comment190087> that worked! Thanks. <comment190088> @Asmus - yes, I just found that too as I was setting up a Service in Automator. Who knew? <comment190165> You are welcome!
