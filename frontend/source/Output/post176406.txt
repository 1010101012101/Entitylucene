Preventing less from quitting when I scroll down <body> I don’t know if it was a change to less itself or to the Terminal app, but when I upgraded to Yosemite I noticed that I could use the mouse scroll wheel to move around in less. Whenever I use this feature, though, I end up scrolling down too far and exiting less by accident. (I have the code-e/code option in my code$LESS/code environment variable, so less will quit the second time I reach the bottom of the document.)  Is there any way to preserve the code-e/code behavior while scrolling with the keyboard (e.g. by pressing kbdSpace/kbd, kbdj/kbd, or kbdControl/kbd-kbdF/kbd) but disable it for the mouse wheel and the trackpad? In other words, if I’m at the bottom of the file then pressing kbdSpace/kbd should quit less, but no amount of scrolling down will quit less.
