In Preview, how to set 'Rectangular Selection' as the default (NOT 'Text Selection' <body> In Preview on the Mac, how can the default Selection be changed from 'Text Selection' to 'Rectangular Selection'  I am opening PDFs and want it to default to 'Rectangular Selection'   Currently I need to go into the menu bar - Tools - Rectangular Selection.  How to change default?  I am using Yosemite.  <answer238538> This is not a "permanent" change, but it speeds up the inconvenience of needing to use the "Tools" menu, by adding a keyboard shortcut:  Here is the strongfirst option/strong for something you can do:  strongCREATING A KEYBOARD SHORTCUT/strong  ol liOpen System Preferences/li liClick "Keyboard"/li liOpen the tab titled "Shortcuts"/li liScroll down to the last item on the left-hand frame's list: "App Shortcuts"/li liClick on the "plus sign" [+]; a smaller window will pop-up, asking for three lines of information:/li /ol  — Select "Preview" for the application  – For "Menu Title", you must type EXACTLY what appears in the "Tools" menu of Preview: for OS El Capitan (Mac OS 10.11), this is currently "Rectangular Selection" (don't include quotation marks)  — For "Keyboard Shortcut", use whatever combination you want, so long as it does not conflict with any other pre-existing or currently used shortcuts. As an arbitrary example, I use "Command+Shift+R". Invent whatever alternative you might like.  ol start="6" liemJust a SIDE-NOTE: if you repeatedly press your keyboard shortcut [which you define in step 5], I have found that Preview will switch back to the "Text Selection" tool [when it is available], which might be occasionally [rarely!] convenient... since, (like you), I too wish that Rectangular Selection were the default... (especially for cropping, etc.)/em/li /ol  Here is a strongsecond option/strong, involving a "built-in" keyboard shortcut, combined along with one mouse-click [instead of the emtwo/em required if using the "Tools" menu]:  ol liPress "Command+Shift+A" to make the sub-toolbar, "Markup Toolbar" appear or disappear; [note: this toolbar has the rectangular selection option on the left]./li liWith sub-toolbar available [see step 1], click the 2nd item in from the left, to enable rectangular selection./li /ol  Hope that helps!...  Note that, for some reason, I have not always had success with the 1st Option [programming an app-specific shortcut using System Preferences] in certain versions of Mac OS or with particular apps -- even though the menu item might be spelled precisely and correctly as it appears. It was thus pleasantly surprising to find that this custom keyboard-shortcut option indeed works under El Capitan [OS 10.11], as of the time of writing this here.  Hope this helps others!  <comment212556> Would that be more of a permanent set up or switchable on a moment? <comment212739> I'd be fine with a permanent set up.  I was thinking it would be a terminal command or ???
