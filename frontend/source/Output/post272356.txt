Is there software to test the hardware of MacBook Pro (Retina 15-inch, Mid 2015)? <body> The company I work for uses MacBook Pros.  Mine is significantly slower and runs significantly hotter than my colleagues'.  I want to test the hardware to see whether there is a fault.  All the MBP's we use are Retina 15-inch Mid 2015, 2.5Ghz i7, 16GB RAM. The main software we use is VMWare Fusion running Windows 10 and the Mac version of MS Office. The machines are all running Sierra, but mine has run poorly since way before the upgrade.  The only quirk is that I use an external monitor, although my colleagues have used my monitor themselves with no problems.  When VMWare is running, the fans are running full speed almost constantly on mine, and Windows can become almost unresponsive at times. My colleagues' machines run quietly and only occasionally run the fans (but even then the fans are run slower than mine).  I am also not able to run VMWare Fusion in Unity whereas my colleagues are.  (Aside from my infuriation, the sheer amount of noise mine makes has become a standing joke in the office!).  If I leave the Mac for a while,  it has crashed when I return and refuses to wake up requiring a reboot.  The external monitor occasionally goes black for a second or two.  I have checked the VM settings and they are identical. I have:  ul litoggled these up and down, /li liwiped the VM image and created a new one, /li lireinstalled VMWare,  /li licopied my colleague's VM, and I have/li liwiped my Mac. /li /ul  I'm a Mac noob and am pretty much out of ideas, and so I want to check the hardware.  <answer272358> Okay, the first things I would do are reset your SMC and NVRAM. Instructions follow.  strongReset your SMC/strong  Your computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can be reset as follows:   ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Take a note of whether the fans and/or anything else improves and report back.  strongResetting the PRAM/NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset the NVRAM on your particular MBP:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongRun Apple Diagnostics/strong  Now to answer your question about testing the hardware. If resetting the SMC and NVRAM don't resolve your issue, you can follow the steps below to run Apple Diagnostics:  ol liFully shut down your MBP/li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.   Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  <comment342316> Thanks, I'm trying your suggestions now. Does the system provide any feedback that the SMC reset process is successful? <comment342317> The LED on your MagSafe power adapter might change colors or temporarily turn off when you reset the SMC. Otherwise, the only usual indicator is a noticeable difference with the fans. However, regardless of any indication you may or may not get, as long as you follow the instructions exactly (taking note of what side of the keyboard you're using at  Step 3, and ensuring you use the built-in keyboard) then the reset should work. <comment344780> Wouldn't it be better to test before resetting controllers and the like? <comment344781> Don't put up with people making you into standing joke, unless it is being given and received in good humour. <comment344793> @DAVincent Resetting the SMC and/or NVRAM are fairly simple procedures that are often used early during troubleshooting as they can resolve a whole range of issues. In this case, resetting the SMC in particular would be worth trying as a first point of call in terms of the _running hot_ and _noise_ issues, and resetting the NVRAM may help with both the _external display_ and _sleep_ issues. These steps are quick to perform and often resolve the issue, but if not then running diagnostics is certainly warranted. <comment348342> Thanks for your time. I did try all of your suggestions in the end but to no avail. A few weeks later the display on the macbook started breaking up and loosing colours and the whole machine was replaced. This one is much better. I think the last one was a Friday afternoon special.
