Can beta iOS updates be rollbacked by Hard Reset? <body> If I have don't have a backup of my iPhone 4s running iOS 9.3.5, and if I have installed iOS 10 beta, can I get back to iOS 9.3.5 without having a backup i.e. by going to strongErase all contents and Reset iPhone/strong option?  First of all, is iOS strongbeta/strong 10 available for iPhone 4s? Because it is beta not stable iOS 10!  <comment335688> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/267079/can-i-install-ios-10-on-iphone-4s?rq=1 as well
