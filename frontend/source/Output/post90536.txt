OS X suddenly becomes very slow <body> I am using a mid-2012 MBP 13in with no retina display, running OS X 10.8.3. Everything was fine until I was watching a video clip on Facebook. Everything just froze, except the mouse pointer can still move, but I can't do anything else. So I was forced to long press the power button to shut the machine down. After that, the whole system was ridiculously slow.  I can boot into my own account, but starting/running/closing any program takes ages. Also, when I tried to mount a code.dmg/code. I was given a error message like "No suitable file system." I know I can just re-install the by booting into the recovery partition, but I'll take that as my last resort.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P75LY.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here are more screenshots of the Activity Monitor:    <answer90542> Check Activity Monitor for what processes maybe slowing the system down. Be sure to switch from "My Processes" to "All Processes" at the top of the Activity Monitor window.   <answer95159> It turns out to be a hardware problem. After getting frustrated with the extremely slow response, I reinstalled OS X via the recovery tool. But that doesn't last long - it starts to get slower (but not as slow as this case), and the Disk Utility complains that "This drive has a hardware problem that can't be repaired." So I send my MacBook back to Apple and they replace the hard-drive for me and it was covered by warranty.  <comment106270> Are you sure you are running 10.8.4? That would be a developer-build of a version of OS X that has not been released to the public yet. Is this the case? I believe that we do not permit questions concerning developer builds of OS X on this site. <comment106272> Frankly, I can't even get to Activity Monitor. I tried to look for it using Spotlight, but it took too long to return a result. <comment106274> Maybe try to safe boot first (hold Shift during boot). <comment106315> Oops, typo, should be 10.8.3. <comment106317> I've added screenshots. Please take a look and advice. Thanks. <comment106351> Can you confirm - how much space left on your system partition. Maybe in "Disk Utility" run a full disk check. And "repair permissions" while you are at it. <comment106498> @bdecaf Well, I've just reinstalled the whole system. But I am sure that I have used less than 100GB for the system partition. (It is about 400GB in total for that partition.)
