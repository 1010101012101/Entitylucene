How to set a Chrome Policy on OS X? <body> I am trying to enabled the Chrome policy EnableLSha1ForLocalAnchors on my Mac running Sierra and unfortunately have not had much luck! So far I have tried the following:  ol liOpened the com.Google.Chrome.manifest file/li liChanged the code below to set the  values to 1 and saved the file/li liRestarted Chrome and confirmed that the setting is not shown as enabled when viewing chrome://policy//li /ol  What am I doing wrong? This seems very complicated compared to how it is handled through the Windows registry.  Thank you  precode    &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;pfm_description&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;pfm_name&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;pfm_targets&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;array&gt;             &lt;string&gt;user-managed&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;/array&gt;         &lt;key&gt;pfm_title&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;key&gt;pfm_type&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;string&gt;boolean&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre  <answer281583> Open a terminal, and run the following, then restart Chrome.  precodedefaults write com.google.Chrome EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors -bool true /code/pre  <comment354313> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. If possible, it'd be good if you could add some more info on what this terminal command actually does? It's also good to provide the command that undoes the original action in case the OP wants to revert back.

Never knew it was possible to update a manifest file that way <comment355342> @dodysw running into more issues and hoping you can help :( when I entered that comment you mention, it didn't seem to quite fix the issue I was expecting it to fix. When I went to view policies (chrome:\\policy) I got a message next to the policy that states: Expected boolean value. I tried changing it to a 1 instead and same result. Am I missing something? Also how does it know where to write the manifest changes to? Thank you!! <comment355742> Figured it out: defaults write com.google.Chrome EnableSha1ForLocalAnchors -bool true    thank you!
