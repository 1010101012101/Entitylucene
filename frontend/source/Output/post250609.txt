How to use the secondary mac's keyboard when using Target Display Mode <body> I basically want to be able to connect my MacBook to my stationary Mac and  use the keyboard and mouse on the MacBook. Is this possible? Ideally using standard software.  <answer251391> That's exactly what Target Display Mode does. The only caveats are that "stationary Mac" must be an iMac that supports Target Display Mode, and you must have a keyboard connected to the iMac to turn Target Display Mode on and off.     Follow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:      ul   liMake sure both computers are turned on. /li   liConnect the Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable between the two computers./li   liPress Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display./li   /ul      After you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from the connected Mac.
