Can I perform inverse trig functions in Spotlight? <body> Is there a way to make Spotlight return the sinsup-1/sup, cossup-1/sup, or tansup-1/sup of a given number without opening Calculator.app?  <answer136728> asin(x), acos(x), and atan(x) work for me. Spotlight gives the results in radians and will not show any calculator results if you go out of the domains for these functions.  Edit: If you want the results in degrees instead of radians, use asind(x), acosd(x), and atand(x).  <comment162301> Thanks, do you know if there's a way to display degrees instead of radians? <comment162303> @TheKraken You add "d" to the end to get degrees. For example, acosd(). I didn't know that before but stumbled upon it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1nhdjb/
