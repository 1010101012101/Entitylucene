Issue with Macbook Pro HDMI to Denon AV receiver? <body> I'm trying to stream videos from my Mac with a high-quality HDMI cable to a 1080p HD TV via a Denon AV receiver.   Here's the issue:  When I hook up with my run-of-the-mill Windows laptop to my Denon AV receiver box, everything works perfectly.  When I hook up with my 2016 Macbook Pro, it does project the screen onto the HD TV. However, the TV screen goes black every 5 seconds, no matter what is being displayed (i.e. it blinks even when not displaying intensive graphics).  I've already reset my NVRAM. Any other ideas?
