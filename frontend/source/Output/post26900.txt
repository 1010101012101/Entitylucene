Can I configure my apple remote with custom keys/functions? <body> I would like to press the kbd&lt;/kbd or kbd/kbd button on my apple remote, and "virtually" make the mac think I pressed the left arrow kbd←/kbd or the right arrow kbd→/kbd key.  Is there a free application for that?   precodeI've found: /code/pre  http://www.iospirit.com/products/remotebuddy/  http://mira.en.softonic.com/mac  <answer26901> Great, I've found iRedLite! I can create my own mappings (they are called layers in iRedLite) with this. :)  And here some other great tips... (old post, but a good reference!)  <comment149681> lol, wait... you still use MS DOS... in a mac?! :-o <comment149684> Did you happen to stumble upon my [new issue](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127765/how-to-configure-my-apple-remote-with-custom-actions-including-sleep-wake-up) arised from this scenario, and found a solution? :P
