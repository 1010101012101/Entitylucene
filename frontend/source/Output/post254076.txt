Getting error code -128 on a late-2015 iMac <body> Late 2015 iMac is rebooting on its own. Only Finder running, OSX 10.11.6. (2) 8GB RAM sticks. Got to catch it in the act today.  After reboot I find kernel: Previous shutdown cause: -128  That doesn't appear to correspond to anything useful in the old MacOS error codes documentation from 1998:  -128  userCanceledErr         User canceled an operation  http://www.macwizard.com/errors.html  The is a refurb unit, hoping it doesn't need to go back for another refurbishment.   thanks  <answer255656> The precise meaning of the shutdown cause codes is not publicly documented, so linked error about emuserCanceledErr/em isn't correct, as these are different list of codes.  The shutdown cause -128 in general is related to the unknown hardware issue (e.g. RAM). If it happens repeatedly, you should take it to the repair.  <comment316275> Can you please reinstall MacOS?
