How to move app window when app is trying to use second monitor that's not present <body> I have OS X10.8.5 (fully patched). I'm using Office for Mac 2011 (fully patched).  Earlier in the week, I was working on a PowerPoint presentation. During the earlier work, I had a second monitor plugged in, and the presentation was displayed on it. Now I'm working at home with no second monitor. I checked under emSettings â†’ Monitors/em, and its clearly not present or detected.  PowerPoint starts, but it does not show the presentation's window. When I right click the PowerPoint icon on the task bar and select emShow All Windows/em, the presentation's window is flung in from the second monitor. When I click on the presentation's window, it whizzes back to the second monitor that's not present.  How do I move the presentation window to the primary display that's present?  <answer158355> There are a couple of approaches. The first works across all applications. The second is specific to Microsoft PowerPoint.  h1Gather Windows/h1  Launch strongSystem Preferences  Displays/strong and use the strongGather Windows/strong button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9zoQu.png" alt="enter image description here"  h1Arrange All/h1  Use the strongArrange All/strong or strongCascade/strong menu items to have Microsoft PowerPoint reveal and reposition the hidden window:  ul liWindow (menu)  Cascade/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7yIBS.png" alt="enter image description here"
