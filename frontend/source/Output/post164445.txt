How can I disable the rubber band effect of the Preview program? <body> According to other sources, I've disabled the codeNSScrollViewRubberbanding/code system option, and it works in my browsers and other softwares. But it doesn't work for the Preview program, specifically when I read the PDF files. How can I disable the effect for the Preview too?  <answer164446> This is currently not possible for apps such as Preview which use a different scroll view.  You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttp://apple.com/feedback/macosx.html/li /ul  <comment192796> Send the feedback. Does that mean it's impossible to do this by now?
