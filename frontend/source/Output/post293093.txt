Macbook Air - External dualscreen goes black after a bit of usage <body> When using my external screen connected to my computer, the external screen goes black after some time (usually fifteen minutes).   The image on the external screen isn't functional, but   ul lithe connection is still operational/li lithe screen hasn't frozen (nor has the computer)/li liit is still recognized by the computer/li liyou can still drag &amp; drop programs to the external screen (despite not being able to see them anymore)/li /ul  It seems that it goes black even more quickly when there's a high load on the processor. I've tried to set the frequence rate to 75 Hz and it did the trick for a dozen minutes, but it eventually "crashed" again.  My question is : what causes the output signal for image not to work after some time ; and what could be used to make it stable ?  Find below the information about the two components (the computer and the external screen)  Computer :   ul liMacBook Air (13 inches, mid-2012), OS Sierra 10.12.3/li liCPU : 2 GHz Intel Core i7/li liRAM : 8 Gb 1600 MHz DDR3/li liGraphics : Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 Mb/li /ul  Dual Screen : Specs here http://www.lg.com/uk/support/support-product/lg-W1934S-BN  <comment369767> Please don't cross-post to different SE sites.
