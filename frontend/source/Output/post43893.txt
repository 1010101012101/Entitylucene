How can I remove an individual name from a Group on the Autofill feature of Mail? <body> How can I remove an individual name from a Group on the Autofill feature of Mail? I can remove the individual from the Group in Contacts, but when I use the same Group to create a new email, it keeps adding the removed address anyway!  <answer44069> You've edited the groups in the correct place — Address Book — but there's one more step you need to take. Mail.app reads the emcore data/em from Address Book when it starts up. After editing entries in Address Book you'll need to quit and restart Mail.app for any changes to be recognized by Mail.  <comment49896> Have you tried deleting the name in the "Address book" application? <comment49904> Have you quit and restarted Mail since editing the Address Book? <comment49938> I've had this happen in Sparrow on the Mac and I'm guessing this is a cache issue because even after changing gmail group lists in gmail sparrow continued to have the problem. I'm guessing mail uses a cache that you might want to toss to see if that helps. <comment50068> @jaberg: Sheepishly--I quit and restarted Mail, and now the offending names are gone. THanks so much, I was making it too difficult! <comment50094> As this solved your problem, I went ahead and added the solution as an answer.
