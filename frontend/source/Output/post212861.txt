U.S. vs. Canadian English keyboard <body> What is the difference between an US and a Canadian English keyboard layout? Could you give a visual comparison?  <answer212863> Apple documents most hardware keyboards at:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794/li /ul  It has both French Canadian as well as English  <answer282882> There's no difference except for the flag icon.  It is presumably there so that Canadians don't have to be looking at the US flag all the time to type their language.  The same holds for ABC, which is the same as US but no flag at all, for the rest of the world.  Unfortunately Apple does not document anywhere the dozens of different software keyboards/input sources which it provides.  <answer282906> I do not really understand the question. But there are many many keyboards for the macbook (pro) and other "hardware" keyboards. For the software keyboards: if you compare the CanadianEnglish and the US International in Keyboard Preferences, you will see that they are NOT the same for special characters, when you hold Shift+Option, for example.  <comment257042> I just looked into the practical aspects, specifically keybindings for all keys and their outputs with modifiers, and there seems to be no difference. However, it seems odd to me that Apple would have the two options if there's nothing different between them, so I'm hoping someone else can shed some light on the situation. Good question! <comment257047> Welcome to Ask Different. Could you edit this. What physical keyboard layouts are you looking at (on which specific hardware) and/or what software keyboard layouts are you looking to compare? <comment257051> I just installed osx captain and have two options for keyboard. Wondering what the difference. <comment327531> He was asking about Canadian English. That link only has Canadian French. <comment356517> The poster is asking about input sources, not hardware keyboards <comment356528> @TomGewecke not everyone that sees this will be asking about hardware keyboards due to the lack of detail in the question. Also, how does the comment of the OP about two choices for el cap install relate? Hard to know if this is an Apple external keyboard or a MacBook Pro or both or neither. <comment356564> @bmike  There is no hardware keyboard called either US or Canadian English.  These are the names of software keyboards.  When you install MacOS you are normally asked which software keyboard you want to use, and these are two names that can be on that list.  Apple does not document the dozens of software keyboards it provides anywhere.  Any software keyboard and be used with any hardware keyboard. <comment356588> The names the poster refers are clearly for the software keyboards called US and Canadian English.  He asks what the difference is, which is "none" in terms of function.  US International PC is not mentioned anywhere by the poster.  It is a layout quite different from either US or Canadian English, borrowed from Windows, which some switchers like to continue using on a Mac.
