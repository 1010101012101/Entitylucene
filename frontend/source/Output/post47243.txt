Folder tree in Finder sidebar (or stuck to Finder) <body> Is there a Finder plugin (maybe SIMBL plugin) which allows one to see the directory structure in the Finder's sidebar (instead of Favorites, Shared, Devices) or in an attached window?  Something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lHLJJ.png" alt="Finder somehow with sidebar"  There is Cover Flow, but it's not what I need.  Also I don't need any Finder replacement; I just want to fix this missing feature in Finder.  <answer47684> I doubt there's a SIMBL plugin to do that. What you're asking for would be a fairly extensive rewrite even if you had the source code for the Finder.  Your best bets are what @jtbandes and @Richard's comments on your question state: get a Finder replacement that does that or use list view in the Finder.  <comment54136> I think you're going to end up with a Finder replacement :) <comment54154> Consider hiding finder sidebar and using column or list view until you get it sorted. <comment75360> "missing" is relative, it's just not there.
