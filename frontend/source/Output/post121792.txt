JailBreak: Open link in safari instead of apps internal web browser? <body> Does anyone know if there is a jailbreak tweak that will allow URLs to open in Safari.app, instead of the app internal web browser?br / I've been looking around but couldn't find one.  I'm using an iPad 3.  <comment142006> What iOS are you running? <comment142008> iOS 7 with the latest jailbreak <comment142241> This might have other implications to it. If you had all UIWebViews open in Safari instead, you'd end up with a lot of applications that simply don't work anymore. <comment142361> Ok thanks mate.
