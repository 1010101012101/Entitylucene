Recovering from Laptop HDD crash <body> My Windows 7 Laptop HDD crashed. I bought a new HDD and installed Windows on it. I also installed iTunes.  I'm patting myself on the back for setting up full backups of my laptop to an external HDD. I have a backup taken from 2 weeks ago!  All my songs are on an external drive, but I do not have an XML copy of my library.  What do I have to do to restore my iTunes content from the backup?  <answer10126> Reimport the content to your library from the external hard drive. Go to File - Add folder to library and select the folder where your iTunes content is. I would recommend having it copy files to iTunes Media Folder when adding to Library from Edit-Preferences-Advanced. Your playlists and podcast subscriptions probably won't be restored but at least you'll have your content back.  <answer10391> I moved the entire iTunes folder (among other folders) from my old HDD to the new HDD - everything automagically appeared in the iTunes application.  <comment10542> +1 for maintaining proper backups.
