Is there way to quickly call the active contact on the Message app? <body> Oftentimes, in the middle of texting, I find myself wanting to call the other party instead.   However, in order to do that, I would have to scroll all the way to the top of the message history, just to get to the strongCALL/strong button.   Is there a faster way to do this? Tapping on the contact name seems to be a logical trigger, but it doesn't work.  <answer92404> Tap on the status bar will bring you to the top of the message. A quick way to get to the call button.   <comment108391> Single taps suffice. <comment108397> Wow, didn't thought it was that simple. Works well! It's not intuitive though. Thank you.
