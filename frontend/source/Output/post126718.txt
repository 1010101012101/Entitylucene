Xserve CPU Load LEDs not working with Mavericks <body> Since loading Mavericks Server on my Xserve the CPU Load LEDs have stopped working.  It's an older Xserve that I am repurposing from an application server to mostly file sharing. It was previously running Leopard Server; after a few gymnastics I now have it running Mavericks server.  My issue is almost solved by the answer to this question: Xserve CPU Status LED&#39;s under Mountain Lion  ...except that since I was never running Lion server, I don't have the hwmond and com.apple.hwmond.plist files to grab from an older install. Any idea where I could get these? Have googled and come up dry.  <comment148480> What model of Xserve is it? Early 2009, 2008 or older? There is only one model of Xserve which is able to handle 10.9 and if you are looking for specific files I can't tell you where to get them nor do I have them to give. Do you have a backup of the drive from when it had Leopard on it because you might find the plist and daemon in there
