Did Apple shut down the Activation Lock checker? Why? <body> I have an used iPhone 6s that is pin locked and I wanted to check whether it was locked to iCloud or not.  I opened icloud.com/activationlock to find out that the service is no longer available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7qDzG.jpg" width="300"  Is there any reason Apple decided to disable this tool? Now it will be harder to tell if an used iPhone that you want to buy is stolen.  <answer277034> Apple has closed this tool. It is no longer available without being an employee of Apple or being a member of Apple's Authorised Service Provider Program.  As for why, Apple hasn't publicly given a reason, but I speculate that it is due to the ability to find serial numbers of devices which have not been registered with Find My iPhone.  <comment348720> Thanks for the reply. But what is a non-FMI device? - Im new to Apple world. <comment348721> @esQmo Non-Find My iPhone, i.e. a device which has not been registered with Find My iPhone. <comment348722> Okay, thank you.
