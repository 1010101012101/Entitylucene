iTunes 12.5.5.5 can't go back/forward while in Music search -- Error Occurred, try again <body> While in Music search/surfing through albums, songs and stuff sometimes you want to go back/forward (kbdcmd + [/kbd/kbdcmd + ]/kbd).  And I noticed today this problem:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VBvfc.png" alt="enter image description here"  preError Occurred, please try again later/pre  So I just do in new search for my artist to find.  Movie and other stores are working fine.
