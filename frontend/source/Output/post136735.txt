How to change ISO volume label on OS X? <body> I have some ISO files here with weird volume labels. I want to rename them to something I can easily remember.  I know in Windows using either winiso or poweriso (both are non-free?) it can be done but I'm not so sure in OS X. I did search the net but nothing useful came up.  <comment162324> How about this answer? Seems like it should work with your situation. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45015/84062 <comment162347> This is something entirely different. <comment162349> just tried. doesn't work. Could not touch /Volumes/G2_28201//.disk_label Could not write scale 1 bitmap label file
