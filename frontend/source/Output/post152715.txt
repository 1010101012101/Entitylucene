Detailed Wi-Fi menu by default <body> When you hold down the option key before clicking on the wi-fi menu, you get all sorts of detailed stuff about your current connection.  Is there any way of making this the default behaviour? A terminal command perhaps?  <answer179285> This is quite a workaround to go through and unfortunately involves paying for a software (unless you're aware of free alternatives)  but thought I'd throw it out there while looking for more details:  Using a program like Keyboard Maestro, you can record a Macro that will be the result of a string/hotkey.   I recorded as follows:  ol liHit record/li liPressed and held kbdoption/kbd key./li liClicked on Wifi menubar/li liStopped recording./li /ol  I then set up the trigger to be a hotkey (like kbdCMD/kbd+kbd,/kbd) or a string like codewifio/code. Both worked. Detailed Wifi menu was opened and waited for my choice.  <answer179301> Another workaround for trackpad users is using BetterTouchTool (fortunately free):  To configure a gesture:  ul liChoose "Trackpads" (highlighted in orange in the screenshot below)/li liChoose a touchpad gesture (highlighted in red)/li liChoose predefined action - Mouse Click Actions - Option+Click (highlighted in green)/li /ul  In my example below I have chosen a single finger tap at the top right of the trackpad to initiate an option-click.  This only works if BetterTouchTools runs. You may enable "Launch BetterTouchTools at start up" in simpe mode in the basic settings or in advanced mode in the settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGH2k.jpg" alt="bettertouchtool"
