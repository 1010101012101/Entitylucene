DNS resolves incorrectly, even after purge <body> After changing a CNAME record on my DNS server, I am seeing issues with the DNS on my Macbook Air running OS X 10.10. Other computers on the same network resolves to the correct, new IP.  precode$ host beta.stoffiplayer.com beta.stoffiplayer.com is an alias for polar-meadow-2518.herokuapp.com. polar-meadow-2518.herokuapp.com is an alias for us-east-1-a.route.herokuapp.com. us-east-1-a.route.herokuapp.com has address 54.243.37.192 /code/pre  This is correct, it is an alias for a Heroku app.  But when I try Chrome, Safari or even curl I get a different IP:  precode$ curl -vI http://beta.stoffiplayer.com/ 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep Connected  * Connected to beta.stoffiplayer.com (52.16.117.175) port 80 (#0) /code/pre  This IP does not belong to heroku.com but Amazon AWS:  precode$ host 52.16.117.175 175.117.16.52.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer ec2-52-16-117-175.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com. /code/pre  I tried to purge the DNS cache but it doesn't make a difference:  precode$ sudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache $ sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches $ curl -vI http://beta.stoffiplayer.com/ 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep Connected * Connected to beta.stoffiplayer.com (52.16.117.175) port 80 (#0) /code/pre  I have even rebooted the computer, but still same result.  <comment230838> Good question. Unfortunately, I cannot answer it. However I think this question would be better asked on  Server  Fault
