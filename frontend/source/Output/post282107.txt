How can I determine where network data is going? <body> Activity Monitor always reports several kB or MB being transferred. I do not know where it's going or coming from. How can I find out?   <answer282112> IMHO the most convenient and simple solution is the Network Monitor of Little Snitch.  It monitors all outgoing and incoming network in real time and provides     fine grained traffic information, combined with powerful yet simple options for analyzing bandwidth, traffic totals, connectivity status and much more.
