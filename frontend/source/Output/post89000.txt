symbolic link not created <body> All my docs are in:  precode/Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs /code/pre  I want to put them on dropbox through symbolic link so I created this empty folder:  precode/Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs /code/pre  Then used this command to create a symbolic link:  precodels -s /Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs /Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs /code/pre  The destination folder is still empty, what can I do to properly make the link?  <answer89001> Your command is wrong.  It is not codels -s/code, but codeln -s/code  <answer89004> As Vincent points out, the proper command is codeln -s/code, not codels -s/code. In addition to that, codeln/code will throw an error if the target of the link (in this case, the codeMydocs/code folder in Dropbox) already exists.  The proper way to do this is to delete code/Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs/code, then run codeln -s /Users/Joe/Documents/Mydocs /Users/Joe/Dropbox/Mydocs/code.
