What can cause start up to stop at the apple logo and spinning gear? <body> I'm trying to help a friend fix their MacBook, and I've run out of ideas. I've gone through every resource I can find, so hopefully someone has some insight into this problem.  When the machine starts up, it gets to the gray screen with the apple logo and spinning wheel, and goes no further. Safe boot is not possible; it stops at the same gray screen, but will automatically restart if left alone for a few minutes.  I've tried running Disk Utility, but it said the disk was fine. I've also tried an Archive &amp; Install, but it had no effect on the problem.  Is there anything else I can do to diagnose the problem, or are there any common problems with similar symptoms?  <comment59038> If you cannot boot the MacBook, how were you able to run `Disk Utility`? Did you boot an install disc? Which version of MacBook is this? Have you run Apple's hardware diagnostics? <comment59040> Yes, I booted to an install disk. The OS X version is 10.6, I'm not sure what version the MacBook is. I haven't tried the hardware diagnostics, I'll do that now. <comment59041> Ah, it looks like the hard disk failed. Booting in verbose mode is giving a lot of 'disk0s2: 0xe0030005 (UNDEFINED)' <comment59042> Did you run [Apple's Hardware Test](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1509)? Well, if it is a SATA drive, it should be easy enough to pull the drive and test it on another system. Just be careful handling it. (The drive probably contains the warning "*do not push on top cover*". Pay attention to it! :) <comment59043> Yes, I did the hardware test and ran fsck. Both returned no problems. fsck says the file system was modified, but also says no problems were found. If it wasn't fixable, the back up plan was to replace the hard drive, so I guess I'll just do that regardless. <comment59044> Strange. Does the drive boot OS X now? If replacing the hard drive is not a $$$ issue, then sure, it can't hurt. (Might even improve performance a very wee-bit. :) But if the current drive still functions that leaves open the option of possibly recovering data from it, should the owner need to. Always nice to have options. <comment59046> No, the drive still doesn't boot. I'll suggest attempting to format it first, but the end result is pretty much the same as replacing the hard drive (without the money). I was hoping there might be a better solution, though. <comment59047> If the drive still does not boot I suggest removing it and connecting it via USB (or eSATA or SATA) to another system. At least run the SMART tests on it and look at the SMART attributes for anomalies. I would want to have more confidence that the drive is **the** fail point or if it was some other defect (on the logic board?). Replacing the drive is another way to go if you have the resources. Of course, if you hook it up to another system and can't do anything with it, then that would be a fairly good sign it is **the** defect. ;) Warranty? Or is it Apple's OEM drive?
