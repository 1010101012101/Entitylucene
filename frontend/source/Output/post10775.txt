Creating and deploying a standard build of OS X 10.6 company-wide <body> My company is growing quickly and we are purchasing a lot of iMacs. Up until now each one has been configured individually but I'd like to be able to define default settings (network settings, Safari settings, dock settings etc) which I can apply automatically on a machine.  I'm assuming this can be done, but where do I start?  <answer10779> This is done using Apple Remote Desktop 3 and a Task Server(s). It's available in the Mac AppStore for $79.  Another useful and powerful software is DeployStudio, which automates disk image installation over a network.  <answer10794> See this question: OS X 10.6 : Automating new system provisioning with scripts. From my answer:     The IT department at my company   maintains a disk image [on an external   Firewire drive] with all of the   settings in place they need to   administer the Macs when they are   received-including software in place   registered with site licenses. They   open the Macs and simply replace   what's on the hard drive with the disk   image.   <comment11281> We used to image that way. If you get more than a couple Macs at a time, this is very time-consuming (and therefore expensive). mspasov's suggestion is more reasonable for a large deployment, although the upfront cost can be more substantial, if you don't have an available machine to run ARD on. Your method is better suited for an organization that only deploys a few machines a year. <comment11282> @Ben: Duly noted. Thanks for the info.
