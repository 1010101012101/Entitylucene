Get list of recently focused windows/processes <body> An application on my Mac seems to want to take focus away roughly every 4-5 minutes. I hate to complain, but it is quite distracting and rather irritating. If I am in the middle of typing and not paying attention my keystrokes will be lost, and I have to click on the active window to regain focus.  Unfortunately I do not know what process is causing this. Whatever it is does not change the name of the current window process. For example, while typing this, I will lose focus on Google Chrome, but the menu will remain codeChrome/code. The active window simply loses focus, inexplicably.  I would like to know how to detect what this process is that is taking focus.  I have considered a polling of the currently focused window with something like:  precode$ watch currentWindowFocusedName /code/pre  Unfortunately, I do not know of a codecurrentWindowFocused/code command, but it's where my thoughts start.  I have eliminated all open applications yet the issue persists, so I imagine it must be a background process of some sort, but I have 177 of those and I am not sure which ones can be safely closed.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  <comment96710> If it happens every 4-5 minutes, I would recommend creating a test user account on the Mac and working for a bit under that account. If it does NOT happen, compare the processes in each user's Activity Monitor list. If it DOES happen, then it is probably a system-wide process, not a user process. Hopefully that can at least be a starting point. <comment96722> @bispymusic: Great call. I did something like this - slowly eliminating groups of processes. Alas, I was too impatient to identify the offender. :)
