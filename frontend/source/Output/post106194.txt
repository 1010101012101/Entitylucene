Do I need to upgrade from Mavericks GM <body> Although the GM should be identical to the final version, I am concerned about not being able to log into my computer in the future because of an expired developer/trial period.  The App Store normally shows a disabled button for installed apps which also will get future upgrades. However Mavericks shows with the "Download" button.  Should I go through a Mavericks reinstall?  <answer106198> Yes, you should install the final release of Mavericks.  The seed of Mac OS X 10.9 GM, Mavericks, is different to the edition available through the Mac App Store.  ul liThe seed had build code13A598/code./li liThe final release is build code13A603/code./li /ul  This suggests bugs were found and fixed since the final preview release. We have had reports of behaviour changes between the two versions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBZRN.png" alt="About panel for Mac OS X 10.9.0"  <comment125126> Okay, but how does one install 10.9 on top of 10.9. I'm stuck on 13A598. <comment125147> According to @Francisco-Garcia's experience in the original question, you should be able to download from the Mac App Store. Otherwise restore to a back up and upgrade, or blank your Mac and upgrade.
