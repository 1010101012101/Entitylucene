How to find movies I have transferred to an ipad <body> I am trying to transfer movies from my linux box to my ipad running iOS 8.  I first just mounted the ipad and copied a movie to DCIM/100APPLE where it is sitting with all my other photos and movies taken from the ipad camera.  How do I find the movie I copied  to play it on the ipad?  I then downloaded Documents 5 (a free app) and downloaded a movie into what Documents 5 calls "Downloads".  I can try to play it from within Documents 5 but it has no sound. I have cinexplayer installed which might be able to play it properly but,   How can I get cinexplayer to find the movie that Documents 5 has downloaded?  <comment204674> Without actually knowing the answer, first off I'd say - Apple devices don't like you playing in their innards; they far prefer to be nicely sandboxed & have you throw files across from iTunes <comment204676> @Tetsujin Thanks. This is why I tried Documents 5 as well. If there is a better linux/ipad solution I would love to hear it of course. <comment204681> because of the sandboxing, you can't get one app to look directly into another app's folder structure. If the apps register as being capable, there should be an offer of 'open withâ€¦' but I'll leave it to someone smarter than me to know how that is achieved at app/OS level. Wish you luck.
