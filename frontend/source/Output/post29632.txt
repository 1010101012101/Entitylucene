Repository of .qtz s in system files? <body> Apparently there is a place within the OS's system files that have lots of .qtz s that you can use for your desktop background.   Could someone tell me the location of the files?  <answer29634> Open Terminal and run codelocate qtz/code to get the list for your system. You may need to install Xcode to get the full set, with the added benefit of being able to run "/Developer/Applications/Quartz Composer.app" to develop your own.  <answer37457> You might be looking for:  precode/System/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Patches/ /code/pre  ..which are the examples that show in Quartz Composer's Library at launch, on 10.6.8 anyway.  <answer39386> You're probably looking for code./System/Library/Compositions/code, which is where the Quartz files are located for iTunes and Photo Booth (and a couple other system things I believe).  As for setting it as your desktop, I'm not sure about that. Simply dragging one to the image well in the Desktop &amp; Screen Saver pane doesn't do anything, but if you know of a way to make it work I'd love to find out.  <answer115099> Although I do not know where you can find the QuartzFiles, here is an application that will allow you to set them to your backgrounds if and when you find them:  http://wallsaver.en.softonic.com/mac
