If you post it I would be glad to accept it. <comment125799> Done. Elsewhere, I saw something about a corrupted font cache interfering with PDF display - I do not understand why though. But you could revert the terminal command and then try `atsutil databases -remove`. <comment131057> This question already has an answer, and it specifies that plugins are not used. <comment131065> Although answering an already answered question is not bad at all, the new answer should add value to the previous answers or replace it entirely. Your answer unfortunately is not helping the OP, hence the down vote.
