Update from OS X 10.11 beta release to retail version <body> A few days after it was released, I installed the strongfirst beta/strong of strongOS X 10.11/strong El Capitan on my MacBook Air (Early 2015 model). The El Capitan beta has been running more or less stable and I only had some minor issues that were resolved in later beta releases.  It hasn't occurred to me to check my OS X version for a while. Upon doing so now, OS X still reads "OS X 10.11 Beta", but the Mac App Store doesn't display an available update.  How can I update to the latest retail version of OS X El Capitan?  <answer213208> I managed to update it now. The new OS X version wouldn't show up in the emUpdates/em tab of the App Store, but it was still listed on the front page. Just had to download that (which also includes the whole installer, so it's a little bigger) and updated the OS. Now it reads "OS X 10.11.1".  <comment257308> I have the same problem :\ <comment261863> I just lived with the fact that I was stuck on the beta for a month (or longer?) But some apps kept locking up the whole computer on me and I couldn't figure out why, so now I'm giving updating to 10.11.1 a shot... hopefully it'll fix the random lock ups.
