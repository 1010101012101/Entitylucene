Where to download OS X Mavericks out from Mac App Store? <body> Can I download OS X Mavericks not from App Store? Considering that my internet speed is very slow, so I prefer to download the OS from my other laptop, rather than leaving the download from Mac App Store in my MacBook.  <answer106360> The only way to obtain Mavericks legally is through the App Store, sorry.  <answer248702> Visit this link. There are some OS X versions, original from app store. http://mhs-notes.blogspot.com/2016/08/direct-download-macos.html  <answer248707> You can't from the appstore but you can from torrent sites, remember you only can use it for a hackingtosh build because apple doesn't allow you to down grade from software. they kinda do but it depends what the first software was on your mac computer, you can make a fresh installation on it with the fist software and you can set the back-up back. and then only upgrade to the latest version of os x.  <comment124913> The only other alternative is if Apple decide to sell it preloaded on a USB stick, which is what I believe they did for a limited time with OS X Lion (if i'm not mistaken). <comment124920> If there is another Mac somewhere with faster internet, and you can use your Apple ID on it to download Mavericks, then that same copy could be installed on the Mac you want.  (Haven't tried this myself yet, but it was OK in Mountain Lion.) <comment125933> I ended up downloaded Mavericks myself, it only took 14 hours :D <comment308269> Welcome to Ask Different!
