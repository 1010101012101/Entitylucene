How do I fix a syntax error in .bash_profile <body> I was installing ruby on rails along with homebrew the other day and was following a step by step list of what to do. I now have this bash syntax error every time I enter the terminal:  precode-bash: /Users/briggsmcknight/.bash_profile: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token `source' -bash: /Users/briggsmcknight/.bash_profile: line 6: `if which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi source /Users/briggsmcknight/.bash_profile' /code/pre  Could I get a small step by step breakdown of what I should do to fix this? I believe the syntax error is by "fi" or "source", but do I just retype it again or what?  <answer264075> The simplest step might be to move the hidden file to your desktop and start over making that file.  If you're OK editing the file - perhaps using nano - you can delete the line 6 or comment it out by putting a # before the first character on that line and saving the file.  precode/usr/sbin/nano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  To just start over and get a working terminal:  precode/bin/mv ~/.bash_profile ~/Desktop/bash_profile.txt /code/pre  <answer264081> Edit the file with a GUI program e.g. TextEdit  Open TextEdit and select the home directory. .bash_profile is hidden so instead of a simple selection then you might have to hit kbdCmd/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd./kbd to show .bash_profile When saving delete the .txt ending TextEdit adds or alter TextEdits's preferences.  <answer264088> Edit the file with a GUI app like TextEdit or TextWrangler - I recommend the latter.  Open the invisible file em.bash_profile/em in your home folder either with TextEdit by hitting kbdCmd/kbdkbdShift/kbdkbd./kbd or with TextWrangler by checking the button "Show hidden items" in the open dialog.  Remove all codeif which rbenv &gt; /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi source /Users/briggsmcknight/.bash_profile/code related lines and only leave codeeval "$(rbenv init -)"/code and your other mods in the file.  Save the file as .bash_profile (without any suffix like txt or rtf).  Relaunch Terminal.  hr  You mustn't source .bash_profile in the file .bash_profile itself (without a proper if/then/else statement) because you will either get an error or a loop.  <comment330919> Can You paste first 7 lines of your `.bash_profile` file? <comment330920> How do you move the file? It is probably hidden and so not visible in Finder <comment330923> @MateuszSzlosek He can't as he can't get a command line prompt <comment330924> @BriggsMcnight do you end up with a prompt in the terminal or does the shell exit? <comment330925> He can open it via TextEdit.app (If file is hidden, there's a shortcut to see it Open File dialog: CMD+SHIFT+.  dot ) <comment330927> @Mark yup - that's why the mv command to remove the leading . ; - ) Also - you still get a prompt when there's an error in the startup shells. Just type the letters above (`mv` is best to do first if you're not sure if you can edit it in shape) and then open a new terminal to test your work. <comment330933> @MateuszSzlosek I had forgotten the key shortcut <comment331085> Awesome it worked! Much appreciated bmike.
