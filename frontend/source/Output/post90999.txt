Adobe reader XI font error with Chrome > print > save as pdf <body> I have a strange error with Adobe Reader XI when opening documents saved from the web, using print save to pdf.  Preview does not have that problem with same document.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/76aOW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Looking at the fonts it shows the font, but there is nothing I can do about it in there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uL0uH.png" alt="enter image description here"  Interestingly the problem is only with PDF's save from web after about March 1, 2013.   The older PDFs work fine!  I am using latest versions of   Adobe Reader   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTo9u.png" alt="enter image description here"  Chrome 26.0.1410.65  OS X 10.8.3  on MacBook Air mid 2012  Running the system Font check it shows the font to be OK.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HBkEm.png" alt="enter image description here"  emJust to add some bitching. I used to smack my software department for writing Error message like this one. I told them, since you already know what he problem is how about telling the customer/user what to about it./em  In summary:  ol liPrint any web page to PDF using the built-in Chrome option (not Print using system dialog)/li liopen resulting PDF in Adobe Reader/li liget error message: "The font 'Times-Roman' contains bad / Flags"/li liopening the same file with Preview does not result in an error. printing the same page with the "system dialog" does not result in a bad PDF./li /ol  How do I fix the Chromes embedded font.  <answer91038> This is a Chrome bug.  It has been marked fixed in version 27, so the easiest thing to do would be to wait for the upgrade or to upgrade now.    To fix the existing PDFs, you can do the following:  ol liOpen the PDF in Preview/li liFile-Save/li /ol  This will rewrite the PDF so that it does not have the issue.
