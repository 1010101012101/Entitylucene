Recursively converting files from dos line endings to unix line endings <body> I am looking for a command that I could use to run on an entire directory and subdirectory that will convert all line endings from DOS to UNIX.  It should be able to detect if a file is text or binary.  I installed codedos2unix/code using macports but it looks that it does miss the recursive option.  <answer10356> Try codefind . -name "*" -type f -exec dos2unix {} \;/code.  hr  In case codedos2unix/code is not available on your system, you can use the following script (save as codedos2unix/code and set as executable):  precode#!/bin/sh  perl -pi -e 's/\r\n/\n/;' $* /code/pre  <answer133310> Here is one line shell code codefind . -name "*" -type f -exec perl -pi -e 's/\r\n/\n/;' {}  \;/code  <comment132419> Don't run this command in the root of a Git repository or else you'll ruin your repository! <comment132528> Also, I had better luck using `perl -pi -e 's/\r\n|\n|\r/\n/;' $*` ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14155400/937084)) <comment157962> Define how a file is text or binary? <comment157964> Text: No ASCII below 32, except for TAB, CR, LF. <comment157983> One line answers are discouraged. Try adding more detail, or comment on it. <comment215845> Works as advertised ! What else to add ? ;-) <comment215846> Hm... well it did screw up some png files though. Handle with care
