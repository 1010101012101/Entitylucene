Position windows via command line <body> I've got a little bit of ruby that sizes and repositions windows to a saved layout. It uses a snippet of AppleScript to actually do the positioning:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Twitter" to set the bounds of the front window to {894, 22, 1604, 1049}' /code/pre  There are two problems though:  ol liThis doesn't work for every app, for instance when I use it to set the position of Gitbox, I get the following error:  precode37:43: execution error: Gitbox got an error: Canâ€™t get bounds of window 1. (-1728) /code/pre/li liSome window positions aren't saved, for instance if I run the script to reposition everything, then I close the MacVim window and open a new one, it will not remember the position of the window that was just closed./li /ol  strongIs there a more robust way to set the size and positions of windows?/strong  <answer74536> The problem you are having with Gitbox is because not all application are scriptable. Which means you cannot talk to it via applescript. What you can do for apps like that is use System Events to do some of it for you.  *strongCheck if scriptable */strong  precodeset theApp to "Gitbox"  tell application "System Events"      set isScriptable to has scripting terminology of application process theApp      if isScriptable then         my scriptableApp(theApp)      else         my nonScriptableApp(theApp)      end if end tell on scriptableApp(theApp)     tell application theApp to get the bounds of the front window end scriptableApp on nonScriptableApp(theApp)     tell application "System Events"         set the props to get the properties of the front window of application process theApp         set theSBounds to {size, position} of props     end tell end nonScriptableApp /code/pre  emstrongGet the bounds via system events/em/strong  precode#get the bounds via system events   tell application "System Events"     set the props to get the properties of the front window of application process "Gitbox"     set theSBounds to {size, position} of props end tell /code/pre  emstrongSet the bounds via system events/em/strong  precode--set theSBounds to {{799, 490}, {513, 430}} #This is a test line that will set the bounds list so you can see the set bound code working un comment to use it  #set the bounds via system events  tell application "System Events"     set size of front window of application process "Gitbox" to item 1 of theSBounds     set position of front window of application process "Gitbox" to item 2 of theSBounds end tell /code/pre
