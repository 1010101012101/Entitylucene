Get resolution of a Mac OS X application window <body> I'm using a Macbook Pro Early 2015 running Mac OS X El Capitan.  I'd like to measure the resolution (or at least the aspect ratio) of a specific application window on Mac OS X. Is there a way to do this? The reason I need to do this, is to ensure that I am running the application window at a specific resolution, or aspect ratio.  <answer231487> You can do that with Accessibility Inspector, Xscope or via applescript "get the bounds of the front window"  <answer232179> Check out the SizeUp utility for Mac OS X -- this seems to work well for me.  http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z66WW.png" alt="Screenshot of SizeUp"
