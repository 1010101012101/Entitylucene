How to get dev of webcam (not iSight) <body> I am trying to stream with ffmpeg a webcam. I am on a MBP mid-'09 running Lion. I know that you can not have direct access to the iSight (Although open-cv seems to be able to...) so I have an external camera.   I know that the camera works, since I use it on Linux and that OS X recognizes it since it pops up in Photo Booth.  I am looking for something to the effect of /dev/video0 but can't seem to find any.  Any help is much appreciated. Thanks in advance!  Edit: That question is similar, however they are asking specifically for the iSight camera. If there is an answer to that one, I would not need to use my USB camera. So I am keeping an eye on that question as well.  Edit: In system information, it reports Venus USB 2.0 Camera.  <comment58469> Is this the equivalent of your question? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/16908/mac-webcam-get-the-device <comment58470> If not, please add the exact camera model and if you have found any camera drivers that might be able to be loaded. Anything you can provide us might help find you a solution. <comment58637> It *is* possible to access iSight video output, see http://www.flownet.com/ron/code/movie-capture.m
