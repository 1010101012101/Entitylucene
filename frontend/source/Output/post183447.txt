How to: Automator, launch an app, as if I dragged n dropped file on App's dock icon? <body> Using automator, I know how to "Launch an App".  I would like to know how to "Launch an App in a specific way".  The app I want to launch, acts differently depending how its launched. If one:  ol liclicks the dock icon.. then gives you a menu to select file etc../li lidrop the file onto the dock item.. then automatically performs an action/li /ol  Using automator, I want to Launch this App, option 2) Any ideas?  thankyou  <comment218703> You want to use an if/else statement for this. Automator itself has no such capability, but you can use Applescript or Shell scripting for this. <comment218764> Thankyou @CousinCocaine.   I could find how to in Shell yet. For applescript I found the basic open command  (which is also available in automator). e.g. "To launch an app (using a command), you'd have to do something like the following:  'open /Applications/Transmission.app'.   However, what is syntax to make the .app launch as the .app currently launches from the dock? <comment219208> OPTION: Create a **Droplet** using AppleScript. (http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/sbrt/sbrt-10.html) **Droplets** are specialized AppleScript applets which are designed to process items dragged onto them. Their icon contains a downward pointing arrow indicating their status as a droplet.  Droplets are written in a specific manner using the on open handler. The following examples can be used as templates for easily creating your own droplets. Complete set of pre-formed script droplet templates (http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/pkg/droplet-templates.zip) <comment219232> this should be an answer. <comment219326> For me, It is an **option** only at this stage requiring investigation and testing.  Droplet is better in code of the original App. So next is to work out for Apps I purchased can I see the objects they are calling to write such a script or must the App be open source.
