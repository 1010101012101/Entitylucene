Not Able to Add Google Internet Account <body> Some people apparently faced the same problem over the last few days.  I tried the options suggested (eg deleting Google passwords from my Keychain) but nothing works: I can't add a Google account in the "Internet Accounts" section on  my Mac (Sierra 10.12.3). Can you please help? Thanks  <comment343473> Saying you're "unable" to do something doesn't provide much to go on. You ought to provide any error messages that are shown or a description of the state of the login process which has made you think it's failed. Saying you've tried the "options suggested" isn't really helpful unless you provide a full list of things you've tried (not just one example). See the linked duplicate.
