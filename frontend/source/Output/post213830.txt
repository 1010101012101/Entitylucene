How can I issue a S.M.A.R.T. Enhanced Security Erase command to a HDD? <body> I have multiple hard drives that I need to erase before selling and some before going in the trash due to bad sectors. I'm not fond of software level data erasing (Disk Utility, DBAN, DD, etc) as it does not erase everything (bad sectors, reserved areas, etc) and is extremely slow thanks to USB 2.0, thus I prefer to use ATA commands to make the drive erase itself. I know how to do this in Linux, however I haven't found a way to do so on a Mac and I'd rather not waste time rebooting to a Live USB of Ubuntu for such a simple task. Does anyone know how to do this in OS X Lion? I'm not some secret spy, I just like to be safe. So please, no suggestions to "just use Disk Utility".
