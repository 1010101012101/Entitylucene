Newly-created contacts in Outlook don't sync to iPhone <body> I hope someone can give me some guidance relative to syncing contacts between Outlook and my iPhone 5. I can sync contacts I load on my phone to Outlook, however when I enter new contacts into Outlook those contacts do not sync to my phone.  Why do my new contacts created in Outlook not sync?  <answer103821> In the case where you don't have a specific failure message or error, it's often best to isolate where the problem lies.  If you were using iCloud, I would recommend you add a contact from your computer then log into the web interface of iCloud to see that the change propagates to the cloud.  If it does, then you will know to focus on the cloud to iPhone part of the sync. If it does not, you can know that Outlook (or the PC end of things is failing.)  You can try these two things:  ol liSet up syncing again on the guess that iOS isn't set up properly/li liGet access to the servers that are syncing the information and dig into the troubleshooting or logs that are available there to determine where the break down is happening./li /ol  <answer120536> It is not clear whether you are using Outlook as a PC-based application or Outlook.com. If you are using Outlook.com and you have enabled contact sync on the iPhone, make sure that the Outlook.com is set as the default contact account on your iPhone.   To do so, on the iPhone navigate to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendar  and under the "Contacts" section set the default account to Outlook.com.
