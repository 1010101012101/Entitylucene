Backquote (<) and ² inverted on my external keyboard <body> I don't know why, but the ² and &lt; are inverted on my external keyboard.  The ² is right after the left shift, where it's written "&lt;", and the &lt; is at the top of the tab key, where it's written "²" ...  Any idea why, and how I can fix that?  Thank you.  <answer261056> You should give use more information about your external keyboard mapping. Your are only talking about 2 specific keys. That special keys can have different location with respect to your keyboard layout (and brand).   I would say that you have an AZERTY based mapping but where ² and &lt; are inverted :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uKLOP.png" alt="AZERTY MAPPING"  strongSolution on macOS 10.12/strong  The best way is:  ul ligo in System preferences  keyboard. /li liclick Input Sources tab (4th tab on macOS if you're OS is not in English)./li lithen click on the "strong+/strong" button at the bottom left of the window for adding a new layout./li librowse the AZERTY mapping and try to find which one corresponds to yours./li litick "strongShow input in the menu bar/strong" (bottom of the window, first option), it let you see you current mapping in your OS menu bar.

I want to maintain Karabiner for one of the two keyboards so I've done a "simple modification":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DahOl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You can do the same with your inverted keys.  Another solution of the problem is disable Karabiner for a specific Keyboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxTBr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment326870> No such problem with your internal keyboard? <comment326977> Wow, That's a complete answer! I already mapped my keyboard to a specific AZERTY layout (sorry I forgot to mention it was azerty). All the keys are working correctly (including ! for example). Moreover, the "" key, is at the right place (it's shift + ). So "" and "" should be on the same key, with "shift" to get "" but oddly, on my layout, "" and "" are located on different key, but not on my keyboard. Is it clear? <comment326978> I know it's not clear, so I'll try another explanation : Based on the image of the keyboard layout from your answer, the ² is swapped with  but  is at the correct place. Is it clearer? :) <comment326979> Also, the first time I plugged the keyboard, Mac OS asked me to tell what was the key near left shift, so I entered , but maybe I misread or maybe there was an error, and that caused the layout issue. If I could make Mac OS forget about the initial question, maybe my issue would be fixed? <comment327070> @CyrilN.  Do you by chance have Karabiner Elements installed? <comment327165> @TomGewecke I did, but I installed after this issue, so it's not related :) <comment327167> Your third comment should be the explanation. You could have CAPS ON while typing on the left shift nearest key... I'm busy to night. I will poke around your question about "forgetting this device layout". <comment327168> Try first to delete this file: /Library/Preferences/com.apple.keyboardtype.plist <comment327169> Then, reconnect your external keyboard and see what happen <comment327415> @CyrilN. Is that working?
