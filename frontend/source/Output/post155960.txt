Chrome window buttons hidden when Save As / Open window appear <body> I am having issue with chrome, when ever I want to download or upload any item, the default window which appears, I cant see the buttons of that window, they kind of go down the dock, until unless I click the browse button (marked in black) to collapse the window and scroll back full again, only then I can see the buttons.  Is it issue with chrome?

It should remember the same size when you switch back to your normal screen or dock settings.
