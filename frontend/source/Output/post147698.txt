Setting an MP3s as podcasts in iTunes <body> I have an iPod Nano 3rd Generation that I use to listen both music and podcasts from iTunes.  Now the issue: I have a bunch of non-iTunes podcasts in MP3 format that I want to add to my iPod as podcasts.   So far, if I add them, they get added as music and they get mixed with the music and I don't like this solution because if I shuffle I get podcasts mixed with my music.  There is any way to keep those MP3 podcasts separated from my MP3 music? Is there a way to keep them with the iTunes podcasts?  <answer147700> This issue has little to do with an iPod Nano but has to do with MP3 settings for the MP3 file itself in iTunes. To change a plain MP3 to a podcast, open up iTunes, select the MP3 then select codeGet Info/code on the MP3, select codeOptions/code &amp; then look at the codeMedia Kind/code list. One of the codeMedia Kind/code options is codePodcast/code so just select that and then copy the newly modified MP3 file to your iPod Nano or any iDevice. You should be good to go.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LeFMQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment343689> I'm on Windows iTunes 12.5.5.5.  This method works, but the "converted" podcast does not show up in iTunes under Podcasts, only on my device in the Podcasts app.
