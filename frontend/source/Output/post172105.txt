Whiteout (missing UI graphics) on toolbar icons in Yosemite <body> Getting this weird UI whiteout on all toolbar icons all of a sudden. Any idea how to get rid of this? I have been using this version of OS X for a while with no problems at all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R2mWA.png" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n9QSJ.png" alt=""  <answer172125> You mean this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BSPN1.png" alt="enter image description here"  Instead of this ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kkdZC.png" alt="enter image description here"  It's the new default since Yosemite - translucent menu bar [it shows the desktop behind] &amp; also some app windows, Mail, Safari etc  Disable it with System Prefs  Accessibility  Display  Reduce Transparency.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YO4Og.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer172259> Restart into Safe Mode by holding Shift on boot, then log in, then reboot normally. This clears any broken caches.  Also try disabling TotalFinder and other Finder extensions if the problem persists.  <comment202604> I think the OP means, that He does not have icons on His toolbar buttons. <comment202605> ah, yeah - you might be right <comment202733> no, just trying to get the toolbar icons visible again. <comment203924> why didn't i think of that? haha thank you VERY much. Its working fine now. It also fixed another issue too.
