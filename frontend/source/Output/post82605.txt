How do I hit Scroll Lock on my keyboard in Windows? <body> Somehow, I appear to have Scroll Lock on, which 99% of the time is irrelevant, with the 1% of the time being in Microsoft Excel.  As the keyboard on my MBP (Model 9,2) doesn't acknowledge the existence of this key (or a couple others I often want to use, e.g. Pause, Insert); how can I un-Scroll Lock my keyboard?  <answer82618> Do you use an external keyboard with your MBP? If so (or even if you don't), plug one in, fire up Excel so you can see the option bar at the bottom (to verify everything worked OK), and hit the codeF14/code key. Alternatively, if you happen to have a PC keyboard handy, just use codeScroll Lock/code :)   <answer82626> Use kbdFn/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbdF12/kbd to emulate Scroll Lock.  Alternatively, Windows 7's On-Screen Keyboard program (search in Start Menu, or find it under Programs, Accessories, then Ease of Access) has a kbdScrLk/kbd key which you can click to toggle.  <comment95312> No, don't use an external keyboard. <comment171357> This has been down-voted for reasons that elude me. My similar question had a down-voted answer because people were attempting to use my "in Windows" Q&A to solve their problems on OS X. <comment199203> How do you run Windows on your Mac, via Bootcamp or within a VM?
