Can Safari's download popover window be made wider? <body> emh2How can the max. width (fixed width≈425) of Safari's download-popover-window be made wider?br/h2/em Is there a way to get at Safari's "download pop over window" in any way so its max-size is larger than 425 px and longer file names are no longer abbreviated?br Maybe via AppleScriptObjC?br br  [[ Answers:  So far (w/o use of AS-objC) just three "workarounds" have come around...  ul liOriginal Workaround #1 ... a mixture of (do) shellScript (cat/sed), AS, Html and Automator/li liWorkaround # 1 ... uses only Automator modules but also contains the above shell script/li liWorkaround # 2 ... with direct AS access on Safari's plist file, a dialog &amp; a "button" in Safari   /li /ul  WA #2 is my favorite; the others' "windows" are more flexible.

"Finder" to     end tell end opening folder /code/pre  If you attach this 2nd "folder action script", it'll move the "dialog" to the right/top of your screen:  precodeon opening folder this_folder     tell application "Finder"         set screenRgt to bounds of the window of desktop         set rightEdge to (item 3 of screenRgt) - 425     end tell     tell application "System Events" to tell process "Finder"         repeat while not (exists window "Recent downloads")         end repeat         delay 0.1   -- wait (and make sure...) for "dialog window" !         set position of window "Recent downloads" to {rightEdge, 61}     end tell end opening folder /code/pre  The only drawback to this solution IMO is, that for a moment each the opened folder and the alert "flash" over your screen...  <comment261901> Not sure if it works, but sometime web browsers have a page dedicated to downloads, so I'd try `downloads://` (like bookmarks://) <comment262015> Thanks, IronCraftMan, but sadly your idea doesn't work with El Capitan's Safari ... although the Bookmarks thing DOES. <comment263958> I've cleaned up your answer a bit with code formatting. Don't use HTML — this is a Markdown editor. Feel free to edit further if I've lost important information from your answer. <comment263960> Thanx a lot grgarside. I couldn't find a way to get my mixture of shell and applescript displayed here correctly as all those special characters tend to behave quite weird when posted here. MY FAULT ... <comment263962> Here's a [quick guide to Markdown](http://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help). Using four spaces to indent a line will preserve the text; four spaces can be batch-inserted with the toolbar button or ⌘K. <comment264019> Is this easier than putting a downloads folder set to fan view in the dock? <comment264051> I just answered that question as an EDIT in my original question on this page. I've got good reasons NOT to display all dozens of files in my Downloads folder ... ; -) <comment264176> Could you hit us up in the chat room or ask on meta how to fix this? It's a mess of a blog post and Q/A seems a bit destroyed at this point. Also, we need to sort out code level issues and get this to stack overflow if that fits your audience better. <comment264189> You're right, I assume I use this page as a kind of "notebook" for myself. Actually I've stumbled over so many workarounds, using combinations of applescript or automator or inline-shell scripts, that I may have lost a clear path. But AS YET there has not been posted an answer directly approaching the "Safari popover window size" issue, I'm afraid ... I wouldn't mind if this Question was moved to stackoverflow at all.
