How do I give accessibility permission to my AppleScript and System Events in Mavericks? <body> I've got this old AppleScript that uses a mouseclick function:  precodeactivate application "Safari" tell application "System Events"     tell process "Safari"         click at {424, 699}     end tell end tell /code/pre  It no longer works, probably due to a change in how the accessibility permissions works in Mavericks. You need to give permissions on an app by app basis. Unfortunately, SystemEvents.app is not in the list of apps to give permissions. How can I make it appear? Is there another solution that does not depend on downloading utilities from third-parties?  This is the error message I get:  precodeerror "System Events got an error: Canâ€™t make {424, 699} into type list." number -1700 from {424, 699} to list /code/pre  <answer107829> Your problem is independent of the accessibility permission.   Replace your click line with something like codeclick window 1/code and it will ask you to allow or deny access to the accessibility features.   There is a problem with codeclick at/code and I don't know what it is.    Edit : My conclusion after some tests : codeclick at/code is broken. br / The release note of AppleScript updated with the release of Mavericks does not state some kind of removal of this feature. Some that might be a bug.   I submitted a bug report to Apple.   Edit : The issue has been fixed on Yosemite, codeclick at/code works well again !   <comment126450> I did not get that result, when I ran a command containing "click window 1". Could you show me how you inserted "click window 1" into an applescript command? And I need to click a specific place in the window, how do I add location to click window 1? (If that's possible.) <comment126451> `activate application "Safari" set coor to {200, 200} tell application "System Events"  tell process "Safari"   click window 1  end tell end tell` try also running it from terminal with `osascript` <comment126466> Thanks for posting the bug! I suspect you might be right about it being a bug as I used a script with that action (literally) thousands of times. :)
