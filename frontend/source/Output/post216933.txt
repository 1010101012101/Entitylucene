Contacts.app: Failed to update account <body> h1Symptoms/h1  I was having trouble with my El Capitan Macbook Pro running slow, especially when using syncing contacts. To troubleshoot, I erased my drive and reinstalled El Capitan. Once I entered my Apple ID and set up Internet Accounts, the problem returned, even though I hadn't deviated from the base install in other ways.  h1Diagnosis Data/h1  h2Console messages/h2  precode11/23/15 4:06:14.115 PM com.apple.AddressBook.ContactsAccountsService[421]: [Accounts] Current connection, &lt;NSXPCConnection: 0x7fc15151cf80&gt; connection from pid 2807, doesn't have account access. 11/23/15 4:06:14.117 PM com.apple.AddressBook.ContactsAccountsService[421]: [Accounts] Current connection, &lt;NSXPCConnection: 0x7fc15151cf80&gt; connection from pid 2807, doesn't have account access. 11/23/15 4:06:14.118 PM com.apple.AddressBook.ContactsAccountsService[421]: [Accounts] Current connection, &lt;NSXPCConnection: 0x7fc15151cf80&gt; connection from pid 2807, doesn't have account access. 11/23/15 4:06:14.120 PM com.apple.AddressBook.ContactsAccountsService[421]: [Accounts] Current connection, &lt;NSXPCConnection: 0x7fc15151cf80&gt; connection from pid 2807, doesn't have account access. 11/23/15 4:06:14.123 PM findNames[2807]: [Accounts] Failed to update account with identifier 4938371A-DC8E-4523-BA40-D26D167F4889, error: Error Domain=ABAddressBookErrorDomain Code=1002 "(null)" 11/23/15 4:06:14.145 PM findNames[2807]: [Accounts] Failed to update account with identifier 9D4385DA-AA0D-4028-9679-A307DBAFC958, error: Error Domain=ABAddressBookErrorDomain Code=1002 "(null)" 11/23/15 4:06:14.145 PM findNames[2807]: [Accounts] Failed to update account with identifier C4CAE0DC-22CC-4C16-91BE-0E63ABD4B700, error: Error Domain=ABAddressBookErrorDomain Code=1002 "(null)" 11/23/15 4:06:14.145 PM findNames[2807]: [Accounts] Failed to update account with identifier A36263CB-A19D-4C2B-89EA-83C1FFF4E24B, error: Error Domain=ABAddressBookErrorDomain Code=1002 "(null)" 11/23/15 5:06:44.118 PM AddressBookSourceSync[2830]: *** -[NSRecursiveLock unlock]: lock (&lt;NSRecursiveLock: 0x7fd5127efeb0&gt; '/private/var/folders/fp/hgp922cd3nq3vx89fc1pjq_00000gn/T/.AddressBookLocks/_Users_merc_Library_Application Support_AddressBook_Sources_C4CAE0DC-22CC-4C16-91BE-0E63ABD4B700_Metadata_.MetaData.lock_lock') unlocked when not locked 11/23/15 5:06:44.118 PM AddressBookSourceSync[2830]: *** Break on _NSLockError() to debug.  11/23/15 6:05:57.483 PM com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge[623]: Checking iCDP status for DSID 183765062 (checkWithServer=0) 11/23/15 6:05:57.492 PM com.apple.AddressBook.InternetAccountsBridge[623]: XPC Error while checking if iCDP is enabled for DSID 183765062: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 "The connection to service named com.apple.cdp.daemon was invalidated."

This is the kind of question in which one can't know exactly what to ask. What's going on here? I have several accounts. How can I know which ones these console errors refer to? How can I make it all better?  <answer251354> I'm looking for a solution also and I've read that deleting all your accounts from your Internet Accounts settings can help. I can't guarantee this will help YOU, though.  <comment312396> We're trying to find the best answers and those answers will provide info as to why they're the best.

See [answer] on how to provide a quality answer. - From Review - <comment327356> It's 11 months after I posted, and I'm still having this issue. I have account update-related issues logged by Airmail 3, Fantastical 2, Contacts.app, `accountsd`, `sharingd`, and `kernel`. These same programs are hogging CPU cycles enough to make my computer nearly unusable.  If you have any tips on how to make progress, even if it's not a full answer, it would make a significant difference for me and for Lorin. <comment327357> One of the accounts that repeatedly has issues is "account with identifier 8316C7CE-CE09-48FC-BED3-42B266AC1200", but I have many accounts. How can I know which one that is?
