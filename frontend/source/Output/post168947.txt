Cannot launch several applications <body> After a emshutdown/em then emstart/em operation, my Mac OS X(10.10) is no longer to launch several applications, including  ul liadobe reader/li liappcode/li liconerstone/li lidiagrammix/li lislate/li liidapro/li likaleidoscope/li liOmniGraffle(OmniFocus, OmniOutliner are OK)/li liGoogle Chrome/li liFirefox/li liSource Tree/li /ul  I guess it is because all of them depend on a certain library/configuration, but I'm not sure.  Is there any way to find out what's going on? like launch some apps from CLI with verbose logs?  h3Update/h3  After I codeClear Display/code in the application strongConsole/strong, and tried to see the diagnostics, these applications launch normally again.   But I still wanna know what's going on.  <comment198358> The Console app did not provide you any output? <comment198361> Do the apps not launch at startup or if you click on them in Finder and what exactly happens in the latter case? <comment198364> @jherran Sorry I didn't know there is "Console". Strangely enough, After I `Clear Display` and tried to see the diagnostics, these apps launch normally again. Still wanna know what's going on. <comment198365> @Mark In both cases.
