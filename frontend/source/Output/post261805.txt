Mail app unable to verify account name or password <body> Lately, I 've been experiencing a problem with my hotmail account when I try to get connected through the codemail.app/code on my Mac (I have the latest version of MacOS installed). It cannot get connected and actually this is the error message that pops out. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O58bj.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have also tried to delete my hotmail account and re-add it, without any success. Also, I have tried Microsoft Outlook for Mac and I experience the same problem. IMAP settings seem to be correct.  All my other accounts work properly.  P.S. I can get connected to my hotmail account when I use a browser.  <answer261979> I created an outlook.com alias per the link below and it now works  See the link below:  http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/set-up-hotmail-on-mac-os-x-3628423/  I also deleted my account and re-added to switch from pop3 to Imap.  <comment327860> did you enable two-factor authentication for your hotmail account recently? You'll need a special generated app password for osx mail then <comment327862> @dennismuys No, I haven't enabled 2 step verification. <comment328055> Same problem. Looks like the problem might be on Microsoft's side: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/cant-connect-outlook-to-any-mail-app/8857c39d-f211-4657-9dbf-f635585b7f83 <comment328123> Welcome to Ask Different!
