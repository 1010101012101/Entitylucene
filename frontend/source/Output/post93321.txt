How to screen capture high-quality for printing for 300 DPI? <body> On the Mac I am aware of how to do a screen capture, but it creates a 72 DPI image. We need a much higher quality image because it's for printing on a color laser printer. We need to be able to print this out high-quality so it looks good on a 11 x 17 inch paper. Thanks!  <answer93337> Taken from here.  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture type pdf killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  Several other choices besides pdf and default png, see link.  <answer110206> If you run codesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true/code and restart, the Displays preference pane will include settings for HiDPI modes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tcDAM.png" alt=""  You can save a screenshot of an entire website with webkit2png:  precodebrew install webkit2png webkit2png -F http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93321 /code/pre  code-F/code only saves a full-size screenshot. webkit2png uses a HiDPI mode when a HiDPI resolution is selected from System Preferences.  <comment109485> It creates a 1:1 capture of your screen resolution. <comment109493> Any way to improve the quality so it looks sharper when printed? Or is there another method than doing a screen capture? Kind of like Print to PDF, but Print to higher quality TIFF? <comment109495> Can this also capture the entire screen, like from a web page even if it requires scrolling to see the entire web page? <comment109538> You mean, with live scroll bars? No.
