External Hard Drive Won't Mount <body> I've searched and tried a lot of stuff but still can't get it to work.  I was able to use my seagate HDD properly last week but now it doesn't mount. I tried plugging it to a PC &amp; another mac, it works fine on both. The reasons could be   ol liUpdating OS to macOS Sierra /li liNot ejecting properly/li liInstalled sims4 with wineskin/li /ol  Things I have tried.  ol liFrom disk utility clicking on mount &amp; first aid. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bn6im.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liFrom terminal writing: codediskutil mount disk2s1/code &amp; codediskutil mount readOnly disk2s1/code both resulted with this  codeVolume on disk2s1 failed to mount If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option/code/li liFrom terminal writing: codediskutil repairDisk disk2s1/code &amp; codediskutil repairVolume disk2s1/code./li liRestarted mac in normal mode &amp; safe mode./li licode/private/var/log/install.log/code from here found some logs but don't know what to do with them. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGWsB.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSwitch USB ports &amp; retry./li liA couple of other things./li /ol  <answer269018> Although macOS Sierra should allow you to read NTFS drives natively, have you tried installing MacFuse? This always works for me.  You can get the latest version from GitHub. (Just download the code.dmg/code and install)  This free utility will allow you to mount, read and write to NTFS disks.  <answer269024> Your drive is not mounting because the file system is corrupted and it is not seeing it as a valid file system.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IcPLq.png" alt="enter image description here"  Most likely, your drive has or is in the process of failing.  My suggestion is to use a tool like DiskDrill's free tools to see if there is anything recoverable.  If it is and it makes sense to, then you can purchase a license to recover your data.  <answer269025> Disk file system corrupted, indeed. If the disk is dying or not good anymore is easy to see with a tool. Download DriveDx from binaryfruit.com (trial) and the recommended satsmart driver. Test the disk.  <comment337909> Could you edit your answer to include how to install OSXFuse, and configure it to work with NTFS? (I couldn't see any reference to NTFS on the Github page). <comment337912> Does it mount in a different computer?  Did you try the "readOnly" option in mount? <comment337918> @John N, Download and mount the Installer DMG File (currently osxfuse-3.5.4.dmg) and then once mounted double-click the **FUSE for macOS.pkg** icon and follow through with the installer.
