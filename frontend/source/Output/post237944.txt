Two mouses one Mac <body> Remember this old Easter egg from Google link.  I want to know: is it possible to have the cursors from two mouses on one Mac? I am able to dualscreen.  Thanks  <answer237946> The Google Multitask Mode is one of Google's fantastic April Fools jokes. Although technically possible to connect multiple pointing devices (USB mouses, Bluetooth mouses, trackpads, rollerballs, etc.) so far as I can tell, OS X presents only one cursor for all connected devices. This posting at SuperUser discusses this question, and one answer points to this software as a possible solution. YMMV.  Note: my boss just came into my office as I was testing this by using two hands on USB-connected mouses, and my nose on the Magic Trackpad. All three moved a single cursor, as expected. I just got a raise for ingenuity and creativity.  <comment291649> +1, so that's how people _actually_ get raises
