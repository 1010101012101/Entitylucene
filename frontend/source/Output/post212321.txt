Can't find or use San Francisco in apps like Sketch <body> I understand that the font is only available for developers, but i'm not one at the moment, but when trying to use facebook sketch template for ios9 i get a prompt saying this   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QKxB3.png" alt="enter image description here"  My question is if there is a way a round this without messing with the system default fonts as this repo does https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont or is it the only way?  system: macbook running osx el-capitan  <answer212324> The short [&amp; even long] answer is no.  It's not only that it's only available to developers, it's that it is not licensed for use as a user font at all, in any way, shape or form.br Even developers are only licensed to use it for screen mockups etc.  See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/208854/85275   Even if you unpack it, tweak it so it no longer appears as a system font &amp; repack it, it would then be a different font &amp; the substitution would happen anyway,  <answer225246> Initially, you had to have a developer account. Now anyone can download the font at https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ and install them on your system (using the font book app).   Now Sketch is satisfied and it won't give you any warnings about the missing San Francisco font.   <answer264345> This guy is a hero - you can download the font here: http://www.developertown.com/apple-tvos-sketch-template  Or direct download: http://cl.ly/1N1k3i1L361h/download/SF-Fonts-August-26.zip  <comment256398> that's what i'm afraid of but whats really bothering me is that i'm not interested in using the font, i just want to use the ios9 templates for sketch, so is there another way (besides purchasing a developer membership) to be able to use sf font with mockups on elcapitan? <comment256404> That translates as "How can I be licensed to use this without purchasing a license?" The answer is along the same lines... <comment256409> fair enough, one last question, do you think the https://github.com/supermarin/YosemiteSanFranciscoFont would work well on el capitan? <comment256410> It's a System Font - it will replace Yosemite's system font, not make it available in your user fonts. <comment256417> damnit, thanks for your help and patience though. <comment347135> Note that it doesn't seem to force you to log in as a developer at the above link. I was able to download without logging into my account first.
