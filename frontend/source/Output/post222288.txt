It is made by c2g br c2g.com/uk/product/81672/usb-2.0-to-fast-ethernet-adapter  <answer222290> You are probably missing a driver for the device. One is available here: USB 2.0 To Fast Ethernet Adapter - Support. I don't know if it works though because the driver is very old (2008)!  <answer223359> It appears to be a compatibility with el capitan. rolling back to yosemite I was able to use it, plug and play, no issues at all.  <comment269373> thanks, but i have tried this driver. it doesn't change anything
