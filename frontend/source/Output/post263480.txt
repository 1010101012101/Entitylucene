CMD + Tab from fullscreen app switches to wrong application <body> Sometimes I have a fullscreen app open , say safari. Then I want to switch to Terminal app thats open on the desktop( along with other apps like preview etc).  When I cmd tab from safari to terminal , the PREVIEW app comes to focus , and its window comes on top.   I am using macOS sierra 12.1   Any tips on how to fix this ?  <answer263516> Force quit Preview, since it has a bad habit of running in the background, like text edit and others. Only Terminal, Finder and Safari should only be seen with cmd+tab pressed in full screen view....good luck  <comment330172> this is not really a solution , is it ?  also , i think its okay to run a few apps in the background <comment330499> I agree Harvey, not a solution, just a  plausible alternative quick fix... <comment336533> No idea how to fix this, but I've been dealing with this every day since Sierra. Handily, macos sets the application you wanted to go to as the default if you cmd+tab quick again...but it sure is a crappy workaround.
