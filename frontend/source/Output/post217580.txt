Not able to open a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) SSD disk in Boot Camp <body> I have installed the full version of Paragon's HFS+. I am fully able to read/write files from the partition that boots OS X, but not an external SSD with the same format.  I get the "pling" sound when I connect it, and I find it in Disk Management (though the format of the disk is not recognized). When following the Help from HFS+, I am not able to complete Step 2:      Call the popup menu for a HFS+/HFSX volume (right click of the   mouse button), then select Change Drive Letter and Paths…   The "Change Drive Letter and Paths" option is grey and unclickable. The only thing I can click on is "Delete volume" or "Help".  Does anyone know what I can do to access the external SSD from Boot Camp?   diskutil cs list:  precodeCoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 4B2BB594-30B4-44EF-B948-B6CFCF9C306F     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         120473067520 B (120.5 GB)     Free Space:   12652544 B (12.7 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 3DE0D8BA-2D65-4BDC-873E-8DB03D9D89E6     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk1s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120473067520 B (120.5 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 86D3701B-9522-409A-BFE1-BD65C802DEAB         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume C0ECB057-CE38-4C8C-B69A-14898070383E             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk2             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          120108089344 B (120.1 GB)             Conversion Progress:   -none-             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               External SSD             Volume Name:           External SSD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Below you see a screenshot of the Disk Management window (unfortunately in Norwegian)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wWR0C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer217589> Disk 1 looks like a typical, bootable OS X drive with an EFI-partition (200 MiB), a main OS X volume and a Recovery HD partition (620 MiB).  I can't say it for sure, but I'd assume your external SSD (disk1 in the Disk Management screenshot) contains a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group on the second partition (112.20 GiB).  To check if the second partition of your external disk contains a CoreStorage LVG boot to an OS X volume and enter codediskutil list/code or codediskutil cs list/code. If you detect the volume type Apple_CoreStorage next to the second partition of your external drive after entering the first command or a CoreStorage Logical Volume Group or a Logical Volume with the size of ~120 GB after entering the second command, your external disk contains a CoreStorage volume.  A Paragon knowledge base article states that Paragon HFS+ isn't compatible with CoreStorage:     ...      [HFS+ for Windows]      If you are running HFS+ for Windows in a Bootcamp configuration, you won’t be able to see Mac OS X partition due to Core Storage restrictions. If you can disable Core Storage as described above, this will give you access to Mac OS X system drive from Bootcamp.   To enable r/w support you have to revert the CoreStorage LVG to a normal HFS+ volume.  To revert a CoreStorage volume boot to a Recovery HD or the OS X volume on your internal disk. Enter codediskutil cs list/code and copy the Logical Volume UUID. Then enter: codediskutil cs revert LVUUID/code. strongemSome CoreStorage LVs aren't revertible/em/strong. If you have enabled FileVault on the external main volume you have to use a passphrase: codediskutil cs revert LVUUID -passphrase [passphrase]/code.  <comment263010> Ah, thank you. I may be dumb, but how do I revert from CoreStorage to normal HFS+? <comment263013> @Goat'sMilk revert how-to - added <comment263014> When I run in Terminal "diskutil list", it says that the external ssd's type is "Apple_HFS". <comment263015> @Goat'sMilk what does `diskutil cs list` say? <comment263020> See edited question. <comment263348> I was able to convert the CoreStorage disk to HFS+, and it is all good now.
