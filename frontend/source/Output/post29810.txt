iCloud: How can I create a calendar event for next 3 days for a specific time? <body> Is there a quick way to make calendar events for 3 days in a row for like 8am to 4pm without having to make 3 seperate events?  Eg.  Make event for 8am to 4pm and repeat for next 3 days ONLY.  Can't see anyway of doing this using the iPhone interface or the iCloud interface.  <answer29812> Create an Event, and then select "Repeat = Every Day" and click "Done" - you'll now see a new option below "Repeat" called "End Repeat" where you then choose e.g. a date 3 days from today.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qm4P.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9wRmx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer29813> Create a new event in iOS 5 Calender and select "Repeat":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1PMsd.png" alt="enter image description here"  Set repeat to "Daily" and go back to "Add Event" dialog. Now you can select either an end date for the repetition or set it to "forever":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c0rAP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment34192> yes but the repeat option is like for everyday... I just want it to repeat 2 times for a total of 3 days. <comment34193> You'll get that option as the next option below "Repeat" - just try it out. <comment34194> Awesome thanks.  I never tried selecting every day because I didn't think new options would exist!  You should clarify it in your answer to include new options will appear etc... anyways thank! <comment34199> You are welcome :-)
