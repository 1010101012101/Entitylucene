Virtualenvwrapper, can I get rid of it from Terminal and my Sublime Text? <body> I have an MBP latest OS running, I tried to follow a guide to install VirtualEnvWrapper a few weeks ago, not too sure why.  But I keep getting this error when opening terminal and its quite annoying, how to get rid? http://puu.sh/nSu82/fcb2f5291a.png  and in my sublime text I see it too: http://puu.sh/nSu9F/2cc43f46a0.png  How can I fix this?  Edit: I also tried  sed -n '3p' $HOME/.bash_profile  and got  source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh  <comment283877> It looks like you need to remove line 3 of your `.bash_profile` which contains a reference to `/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh`. Edit your post with the results of this command `sed -n '3p' $HOME/.bash_profile` <comment283883> what do you mean by edit my post. I typed in what you stated and I received this in response:  sed -n '3p' $HOME/.bash_profile source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh <comment283886> I now have a screen image of .bash_profile itself: http://puu.sh/nSwNN/40d3031c44.png <comment283906> Remove the offending line and the error message will go away. Then try to reinstall VirtualEnv following the guide (if you really need it).
