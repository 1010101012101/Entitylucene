How can I turn my email off for the night? (iOS) <body> I would like to be able to easily turn on and off notifications for a particular app. I have my reasons for this, and if you'd like to know them you can check the edit history, but please keep responses to the topic of how I can do this, not whether I should want to.  There seem to be a couple of options for this, but neither is ideal.  Firstly, I could turn on "do not disturb" mode for the periods when I'd like the notifications turned off. This will block notifications from other apps, so it's not what I want.  Secondly, I could go to Settings - Notification Centre - [my app] and toggle "Show on Lock Screen". This doesn't seem to be something Siri can do for me, and it's something I want to do very often, so going this deep in the menu hierarchy is inconvenient.  Is there a more convenient way to toggle notifications for a particular app?  <answer143202> As for the current version of iOS (7). No, there is not. Apple only offers the Do Not Disturb feature and the settings for notification center which are emcurrently/em not controllable by Siri.  <comment168661> I've removed the comments, please let's assume that the OP has his reasons for the question.
