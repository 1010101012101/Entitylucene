Show hidden all files, but hide some <body> I am trying to show all files and hide some. I know about the command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool YES /code/pre  But that shows even files that I have hidden with codechflags hidden/code. I want to hide those files. Is it possible to change its name into a ._ file, or is that not safe? I don't want to codechflags nohidden/code manually one by one. Is there a way to do so?  hr  Mac OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks)  <answer188939> The code.filename/code was intended by unix to represent invisible file names. Even before there was GUI's, the codels/code command by default would not list these files for normal users. There is no reason you can not add a code./code prefix to your own file names.  On the other hand, using code._filename/code seems to be unique to OS X. One use of these filenames is to store addition information regarding files with the same name minus the code._/code prefix. OS X even has a special command codedot_clean/code to delete or merge these types of files.    In my option, I would not risk deliberately using the code._/code prefix in my filenames. You may get acceptable results now, but future versions of OS X may interpret such names differently.  For example, let's say you create a file called code._dave/code. Later could OS X end up creating a file called code._._dave/code?  Just FYI: It is possible to create a service that would allow you to set the hidden file flag for highlighted files using the Finder application. The instructions are given below.  ol liOpen the Automator application./li liFrom the menu bar choose "File", then "New"./li liSelect "Service" and click "Choose"./li liDrag the action "Run AppleScript" to where it says "Drag actions or files here to build your workflow"./li liSet "Service receives selected codetext/code in codeany application/code" to "Service receives selected codefiles or folders/code in codeFinder/code"./li liReplace the code  precodeon run {input, parameters}      (* Your script goes here *)      return input end run /code/pre  with  precodeon run {input, parameters}     try         repeat with currentfile in input             try                 do shell script "chflags hidden " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of currentfile             end try         end repeat     end try     return input end run /code/pre/li liSave service as "Set Hidden Flag"./li liClose all Automator windows and quit the Automator application./li /ol  The service should have been saved in the code~/Library/Services/code folder under the name codeSet Hidden Flag.workflow/code. If not, move it there.  Now when you highlight one or more files using the Finder application, you can right click and select "Set Hidden Flag" to hide from the Finder application.  A simular service named "Reset Hidden Flag" can be created using the same steps, with the following two exceptions. In step 6, change  precodedo shell script "chflags hidden " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of current file /code/pre  to  precodedo shell script "chflags nohidden " &amp; quoted form of POSIX path of current file /code/pre  In step 7, change to save as "Reset Hidden Files".   Of course, you can not highlight the hidden files unless the Finder application displays them. To do this see my answer to Hotkey to show hidden files and folders in File Open dialog?  <comment223732> Which file names to you want to change to `.filename`? <comment223733> For example, applications, text files. If possible, even folders. Like maybe change "secret.txt" to "._secret.txt" and open it through terminal. with showallfiles set to YES, i can see .filename files. However not ._filename Is it safe to do ._? I might need to unhide it as well <comment223744> You can name your own files however you want to (well, mostly at least). Renaming files provided or required by the OS and/or applications will break things though <comment223746> @patrix so it is unsafe to hide files by putting ._ before them? If yes, is there another way to hide files even from AppleShowAllFiles <comment223752> Also using zip tools or other copies to and from non HFS disks will merge undergo the ._ files <comment223753> Thanks. The solution then is to make a service that hides them. And `sudo ls` shows hidden files as well? <comment223754> @Mark: I was thinking if someone executed `dot_clean -n` is an effort to clean their folders. This command deletes each dot underbar file if there is no matching native file. All of TheBro21's files would be gone. <comment223758> Yes I was just adding other cases where he would lose files <comment223759> @TheBro21 The solution is not to do that you will corrupt data using ._ files <comment223768> It's unsafe to rename system- or application-provided files in any way (e.g. if you rename your `Library` folder to `._Library`, you better have a second account configured or know how to use single user mode if you want to log in again). <comment223772> Basically not worth the risk. As David Anderson said, future updates could mess it up as well. <comment223791> @TheBro21: Use `ls -A` or `ls -a` instead of `sudo ls`. This will save you from having to type a password. Also, I updated my answer. <comment224068> @DavidAnderson Thanks alot. Greatly appreciated
