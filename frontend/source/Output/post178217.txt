Is it possible to make iTunes write rating on the file itself? <body> I'm on Yosemite (10.10.2) and using iTunes (12.1.0.50).br I read that iTunes saves the rating of the songs on its own database, not the audio files tags themselves. Is there a way to make iTunes to write the ratings on the files? Because if I move the audio file to any other place, the rating won't be recognized.  <answer178239> I would say it simply can't be done.  Yate Music Tagger [$20] is about the most comprehensive in- &amp; out-iTunes database cataloguer I know &amp; even that can't do it. It can carry the tags, but not in the tune file itself, it uses a separate CSV.  If you need tag portability, it might be the tool for you, though, as it can carry the data between different iTunes &amp; phones.

You'll have to build it yourself or download the binary; it seems to work for me: https://github.com/carlonluca/ITunesEmbed. Backup your library before using it.  <comment211077> iTunes itself can't. Maybe there's some plugin that does that, but I haven't found any using google
