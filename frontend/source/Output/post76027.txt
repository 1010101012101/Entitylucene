How do I get a notification sound on my iPhone 5? <body> For apps like Instagram or Snapchat, when my screen is on the lock screen and a notification shows up, there is no sound.  Can I enable notification sounds for Instagram or Snapchat?  <answer119973> h2Method 1/h2  Settings  Notification Center  Snapchat  Toggle Sound  h2Method 2/h2  Snapchat  Settings Button Â Notifications  Toggle it  <comment88209> In the settings app - have you perhaps turned off sound for Instagram in notifications? If so, and a notification arrives and is silent, then it's up to the programmer to add a sound to their app and not so much that you would tell the OS to play this sound for that app. <comment88219> Is the silent switch on the side of the iPhone activated (orange)?
