Automatically Retrieving Album Names for Unknown Album Songs in iTunes <body> I'm running codeiTunes 11.1.2/code on codeOSX Mavericks/code and have a bunch of songs of emunknown albums/em. I know that we can retrieve emalbum artwork/em from the emalbum name/em, but that's not what I am interested in. What I would like to know is wether it is possible or not to retrieve strongalbum name/strong for each song I have given only strongsong name/strong and strongartist name/strong (and maybe the song file itself, of course).  All I found when searching for it is the emunknown album problem/em when updating iTunes, or the emalbum artwork/em retrieval from emalbum name/em. Thank you.  <answer107957> h2Tagalicious/h2  Whilst it has been discontinued, Tagalicious has worked well for me for a long time, finding accurate results to missing info on music in my iTunes library.  h2MusicBrainz Picard/h2  A cross-platform ID3 tag finder for songs. Despite the fact that it doesn't integrate with iTunes specifically, the ID3 tags can be read by iTunes.
