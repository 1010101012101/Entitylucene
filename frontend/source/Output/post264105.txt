OSX Terminal "last" does not show more logins before todays <body> In Mac OSX 10.12.1, using Terminal   precodelast /code/pre  does not show logins before today? I did read the earlier article and tried  precodesudo last /code/pre  which did not reveal anything earlier.  <answer264118> codelast/code works in Sierra like in all older OS X systems equipped with ASL.   Here is an example of a Sierra VM (sfirst light:/s installed: Sep 20, 2016):  precodeuser  ttys001                       Fri Dec  9 02:31   still logged in user  ttys000                       Fri Dec  9 02:30   still logged in user  console                       Fri Dec  9 02:30   still logged in ... reboot    ~                         Wed Sep 21 00:01  user  console                       Tue Sep 20 22:18 - crash  (01:42) reboot    ~                         Tue Sep 20 22:18  user  ttys000                       Tue Sep 20 22:08 - crash  (00:09) _mbsetupuser  console               Tue Sep 20 22:01 - crash  (00:17) user  console                       Tue Sep 20 22:00 - crash  (00:17) reboot    ~                         Tue Sep 20 21:59  /code/pre  You can check any misbehavior of last/ASL with Terminal.app:  Open a new shell and enter codesudo opensnoop -n last/code, then open a tab with kbdâŒ˜/kbdkbdT/kbd and enter codelast/code.  In the first tab you should get something like:  precode  UID    PID COMM          FD PATH                    501   7281 last           3 /dev/dtracehelper       501   7281 last           3 /var/log/asl            501   7281 last           4 /var/log/asl/2016.12.04.G80.asl    501   7281 last          -1 /var/log/asl/2016.12.04.U0.asl    501   7281 last           5 /var/log/asl/2016.12.04.U501.asl    501   7281 last           6 /var/log/asl/2016.12.05.G80.asl    501   7281 last          -1 /var/log/asl/2016.12.05.U0.asl    501   7281 last           7 /var/log/asl/2016.12.05.U501.asl    501   7281 last           8 /var/log/asl/2016.12.06.G80.asl    501   7281 last          -1 /var/log/asl/2016.12.06.U0.asl    501   7281 last           9 /var/log/asl/2016.12.06.U501.asl    501   7281 last          10 /var/log/asl/2016.12.08.G80.asl    501   7281 last          -1 /var/log/asl/2016.12.08.U0.asl    501   7281 last          11 /var/log/asl/2016.12.08.U501.asl    501   7281 last          12 /var/log/asl/2016.12.09.G80.asl    501   7281 last          -1 /var/log/asl/2016.12.09.U0.asl    501   7281 last          13 /var/log/asl/2016.12.09.U501.asl    501   7281 last          14 /var/log/asl/BB.2017.09.30.G80.asl    501   7281 last          15 /var/log/asl/BB.2017.10.30.G80.asl    501   7281 last          16 /var/log/asl/BB.2017.11.30.G80.asl    501   7281 last          17 /var/log/asl/BB.2017.12.31.G80.asl    501   7281 last          18 /var/log/asl/Logs       501   7281 last          18 /var/log/asl/StoreData    501   7281 last           3 /etc/localtime          501   7281 last           3 /usr/share/zoneinfo/UTC /code/pre  which shows all files opened/read by emlast/em. Quit opensnoop by entering: kbd^/kbdkbdC/kbd.  If you don't get a similar output check your ASL subsystem (e.g. asl.conf or the launch daemons com.apple.syslogd/com.apple.aslmanager)/the folder /var/log/asl and repair everything if necessary.  <comment330950> From a former responder that deleted their comment, it would seem this is because of logs prior to today being .gz compressed. Really? Is there not a single online capability to see all the logins in an OS X instance's history? <comment330951> What are the results of- `syslog -k Sender login` ? <comment330952> I deleted an answer that was not correct. According to `man wtmp` on macOS 10.12.1, "These files no longer exist in 10.5 or later. `/var/run/utmp`, `/var/log/wtmp`, `/var/log/lastlog`". <comment330953> The result of the syslog confirms what Christopher is saying: `NOTE:  Most system logs have moved to a new logging system.  See log(1) for more information.` <comment331032> Results from `opensnoop` on 10.12.1: `dtrace: system integrity protection is on, some features will not be available` and 33 of these: `dtrace: error on enabled probe ID 5 (ID 188: syscall::open:return): invalid user access in action #11 at DIF offset 24`. 33 corresponds to the files shown in the answer. Why that message? Results from `last`: good logins since Sep, 2016. Why not since Sep 2015 when I first logged in (upgrades)? How do we find bad logins? <comment331037> @Christopher I disabled SIP to get the opensnoop result. In my physical Mavericks install I get only the logins etc of the last ~one year (Dec 02, 2015-Dec 09, 2016) though I never reinstalled/deleted anything since Jan '14.
