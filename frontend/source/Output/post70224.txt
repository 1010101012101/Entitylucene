Automating Quicktime Image Sequence creation in Mountain Lion <body> I have 69 folders of jpegs I want to turn into 69 quicktime timelapse movies.  Rather than doing this one-at-a-time in Quicktime 7 Pro (Open Image Sequence, select first frame, choose 30 fps as the frame rate, wait for frames to assemble, save result while selecting "as reference movie", change the name of the resulting Quicktime from "Untitled.mov" to the corresponding jpeg folder name, repeat) -- is there an easy way to automate this?  <answer70229> Automator with some AppleScript will do this nicely. The frames need to be named consistently — codeblah1.jpg blah2.jpg blah3.jpg … blah50.jpg/code etc. Each sequence you want to be a movie should be in its own folder.  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong and create a new workflow./li liAdd the strongGet Specified Finder Items/strong action and add each folder containing the sequences to the action./li liAdd the strongRun AppleScript/strong action, with the following code:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     repeat with theFolder in input         tell application "Finder" to set theSequence to first item of folder theFolder as alias         tell application "QuickTime Player 7"             activate             open image sequence theSequence frames per second 30              set nameSequence to (theSequence as string) &amp; ".mov"              tell document 1                 with timeout of 500 seconds                     save self contained in nameSequence                 end timeout              end tell         end tell     end repeat end run /code/pre/li /ol  Run it, and you'll get a code.mov/code in each folder. Let me know if you have any questions.  The AppleScript code is adapted from this post at the Macworld Hints forum.  <comment81556> Would http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13385/stop-motion-movie-with-imovie11 be an option? <comment81608> Thanks!  Changed "save self contained in nameSequence" to "save in nameSequence" in order to save as QuickTime reference movie. <comment81610> I think iMovie would re-compress to a smaller resolution.  I prefer to stick to QuickTime Pro and stay full rez. <comment81639> Here's the resulting video posted to YouTube: http://bit.ly/QXrstl <comment120465> I tried your script and works perfect! Do you know how to change the compression settings to the same script, in order to use an Apple Prores for example? Otherwise works perfectly well, but it compress it as a Photojpeg codec. Thank you very much for the post <comment120921> I don't know.  I guess you could use MPEGStreamclip or Apple's Compressor to batch encode your photojpegs into Prores.
