What are the recommended settings for iCloud + MobileMe? <body> I have a apple account on a gmail address and a separate MobileMe account. What should my settings be on the Mac in:   ul liiCloud System Preferences/li liMail, Contacts, Calendars System Preferences/li liaccounts in Mail.app/li /ul  On iOS:  ul liiCloud settings/li liMail, Contacts, Calendars settings/li /ul  <answer29825> I have the same thing. Just use your .me or .mac login for your iCloud setting and try it on your computer and the cloud, then when it's working set up an iOS device or all your iOS devices.  You can also use your gmail Apple ID which I have as well but my setup is working just fine with my .me address.  Patrix, the confusion is with Apple IDs and old mobileme accounts. But, iCloud should work fine with either login: gmail address or .me address.  <comment34195> What's wrong with just going with the default settings? If you are concerned about a single setting, please be more specific. <comment34196> You tell me what the default settings are. <comment34205> iOS and OSX set the default settings automatically when you create an account. <comment34210> So I tell iCloud to use my me.com account, even though my real account is a gmail account? <comment34211> @Richard: Ah, thanks, didn't notice this. Michiel: You have to decide on one account to use for the iCloud stuff (Mail, Contacts, Calendards, iWork etc.). Depends on what you've used your Apple ID (with the Gmail address) til now: If this is your iTunes account, I would probably go with keeping this and upgrading MobileMe to iCloud. <comment34216> Perhaps you might go through the [iCloud FAQ](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4436) and let us know which step has you confused? The main confusion I have seen is people not knowing [which AppleID to use for iCloud](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4895).
