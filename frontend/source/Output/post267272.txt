How to mount an APFS formatted volume created on macOS 10.12.1 on macOS 10.12.2? <body> According to this thread from Apple Developer Forums, an APFS volume created on macOS 10.12.1 is not mountable on macOS 10.12.2, because of the incompatible changes.  I put some important files in my external drive formatted as APFS, and now I would like to access the data. I tried this:  precodediskutil apfs list /code/pre  This:  precodesudo fsck_apfs disk1s2 /code/pre  And this:  precodediskutil apfs addVolume disk1s2 APFS MyVolume /code/pre  The error message is similar to what mentioned in the above thread:  precode$ diskutil apfs -IHaveBeenWarnedThatAPFSIsPreReleaseAndThatIMayLoseData list  ====================================================================================================== ENUMERATION OF ALL CURRENT APFS OBJECTS    apfs call: sizeForContainer: err=-69808="Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup"    apfs call: freeSpaceForContainer: err=-69808="Some information was unavailable during an internal lookup" | |-- APFS CONTAINER REFERENCE = disk1s2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------  $ sudo fsck_apfs disk1s2  ** Checking volume. ** Checking the container superblock. error: nx_incompatible_features has unsupported flags: (0x1)    Container superblock is invalid. ** The volume disk1s2 could not be verified completely. /code/pre  My questions are:  ul liIs there an official utility that help me to mount the volume?  ul liOr to upgrade the old APFS to the new APFS?/li /ul/li liIs there any way to downgrade my macOS 10.12.2 to 10.12.1?  ul liI don't have "Install macOS Sierra.app" in hand, is there any "secret" way to download a previous version of macOS? (I mean previous versions of Sierra, not El Capitan or earlier releases)/li liI don't have Time Machine backups or similar. I would like to fresh install macOS 10.12.1 on my old MacBook, mount the volume, and copy it elsewhere./li /ul/li /ul  Thanks!  <answer267274> I guess you'll have to try find someone still on 10.12.1, or who has the installer.   Lessons learned:    ol liDon't use betas for mission-critical tasks.  /li liKeep installers.  /li liKeep backups./li /ol  <comment335298> Thanks for your warm suggestions! I do keep installers and that's why I need to mount the external drive! The installers are too huge so that I put all of them in the external drive! <comment335360> @SiuChingPong-AsukaKenji- But if you needed to use any of the installers on a computer running a version of OS X older than Sierraâ€¦?? <comment335391> @timothymh : All my macOS devices use Sierra. When I need to use the images, I just burn them on USB thumb drive, or mount them directly as a drive in a VM. And yes, I know there's a warning saying that APFS is pre-release software, but according to my previous experience in using `btrfs` or `ext4`, there was no incompatibility problems. I trust Apple and I thought the warning was no more than a warm reminder. I was wrong.
