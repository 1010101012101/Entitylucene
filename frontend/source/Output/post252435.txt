After your friend signing in their Apple ID on your phone, you or your friend probably might not select to delete the contacts after signing out from your device. That would be the reason that you can see your friend's contact.   You can easily restore your contacts via iCloud (https://www.icloud.com/#settings). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zu09A.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment314109> From your description it looks like you did not delete your friend's contacts before signing in again with your Apple ID, is that correct? <comment314123> You can have multiple contact groups on one phone.  Setup - Mail contacts Calendars how many and which accounts signed in for "contacts"?
