How to delay a cmd+Q in the same way as the Caps Lock is delayed? <body> On my Mid-2009 MacBook Pro the Caps Lock button has a convenient delay such that when I hit it accidentally it doesn't turn on immediately.br Can I incorporate such a delay for another key combination? I would like to delay the kbdcmd/kbd + kbdQ/kbd shortcut such that when I accidentally hit it the application is not quit and I have time to recover.   <comment256695> Cool. Thanks @bart
