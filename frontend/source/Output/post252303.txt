Back up Mac using CarbonCopyCloner with command line only? <body> strongBackground:/strong  I never expected to have emonly/em command line access to my Mac, but the day has arrived!  :)  Due to a video card problem, any attempt to boot the normal OS or recovery partition results in a kernel panic.  However, I emcan/em boot into Single User mode!  (The screen has a bunch of green horizontal lines through it every other pixel, but it is still readable.)  I have checked and verified that my data is intact.  I have a Genius Bar appointment to get the video card replaced.  I have a couple of backup drives on which I have CarbonCopyCloner backups of my computer, however these are out of date.  hr  strongI want to back up my Mac from the Single User Mode command line using CarbonCopyCloner/strong before I take it for the video card replacement.  (I found this link on the codeccc/code tool, but I don't have ccc 4.)  Questions are:  ol liHow can I use CarbonCopyCloner 3.5.7 from the Single User Mode command line to update one of my full backups before I take the machine in for service?/li liemIf/em this can't be done from the command line with this version of CCC, how else could I back up all data before taking it in for service (from Single User mode)?/li /ol  <answer252304> If you are OK with not using CCC to make the backup you could use the command line to create a regular disk image.  Not sure if this is something that will work for you, but I don't have any knowledge as far as CCC goes.  codesudo hdiutil create ~/Desktop/{disk image name}.dmg -srcdevice /dev/{disk identifier}/code  <answer252309> Boot to Single User Mode with one (empty) backup drive attached. Execute the indicated standard commands:  ul licode/sbin/fsck -fy/code/li licode/sbin/mount -uw //code/li liGet the disk identifier of the external backup drive:  precodegpt -r show disk1 #(or disk2, disk3) search for the proper drive with gpt because *diskutil* won't work in SU mode /code/pre/li liMount the external drive's main partition (e.g. disk1s2) to /Volumes/externaldrive and create a new folder:  precodemkdir /Volumes/externaldrive /sbin/mount -o nosuid -w -t hfs /dev/disk1s2 /Volumes/externaldrive mkdir /Volumes/externaldrive/new_backupdir /code/pre/li liBackup your main drive with rsync e.g:  precodersync -aE --exclude='/Volumes' / /Volumes/externaldrive/new_backupdir /code/pre  If you want to backup only the folder /Users modify the rsync command accordingly. Please check codeman rsync/code for the appropriate options. Some of the useful options (like -v) don't work in SU mode - at least for me. Depending on your system, the options set and the excluded items the rsync command will yield some minor errors./li /ul  hr  This backup isn't bootable per se. You may create a bootable backup though by backing up to the root of the external drive and blessing the appropriate boot.efi.  <comment313896> Hmmm, this looks like it would create on the *main* hard disk, a backup of some *different* hard disk. <comment313898> As I understand it CCC uses rsync under the hood.  Although I don't have the exact command you would need, this likely is possible <comment313900> Your best bet is to connect the broken mac to another mac in target disk mode then do the backup from the other mac. <comment313907> @fd0, yes, but I don't have another Mac.  Is rsync the best bet, then? <comment313913> Is `rsync` available on stock OS X? <comment313914> @MaxRied Sure. But some options don't work in SU mode! <comment313915> Do you know if it is used by OS X internally? <comment313916> @MaxRied I don't know of any use of it...
