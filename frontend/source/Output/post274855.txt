What GUI tool can read maildir? <body> I can use mutt to read maildir on Mac, but is there any graphical tool available?  precodemutt -f /path/to/maildir /code/pre  Since mutt can't render HTML emails, I will need something else.  Any ideas?  strongEDIT for thunderbird/strong  I've changed mail store to maildir format,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CZc8p.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And selected a local folder,  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BI4dU.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The UI become like this, unexpected ..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/22cJa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer274893> Thunderbird can use maildir. https://support.mozilla.org/t5/Basics/Maildir-in-Thunderbird/ta-p/32138. Create a new account in thunderbird. Quit thunderbird. cd to the newly created maildir. rm -rf and then symlink to your existing maildir you used with mutt. Reopen thunderbird.  <comment345657> I assume that https://debian-administration.org/article/75/Reading_HTML_email_with_Mutt is not what you want? <comment345758> Looks good, where should I symlink the maildir to? <comment345761> @patrix nope .. <comment345801> @daisy It looks like you are pointing to the original maildir from inside thunderbird. I was suggesting that you let thunderbird make a new maildir, then delete it. then symlink. rm -rf /path/to/thunderbirdmaildir ;; ln -s  /path/to/muttmaildir /path/tothunderbirdmaildir  ;; why not let thunderbird or Mail.app just redownload the messages from imap?
