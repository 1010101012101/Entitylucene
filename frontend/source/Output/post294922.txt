Finder Services Workflow Bug â€” Not appearing in menu and shortcut not working <body> It seems this is a popular ongoing issue with no clear answer. I've read several other AD questions about this but most do not have any answers.  I've created a Finder workflow and check-marked that workflow strongplus/strong a bunch of other emprebuilt/em services from the Files/Folders section of System Preferences.  Only some of the prebuilt services then appear under Finder  Services, but not the ones I really want, including the service I made.  Why would some of the prebuilt services not appear? I can understand my custom one not appearing. I've done everything I can to make them appear according to the other AD answers.  Any advice/insight would be appreciated.
