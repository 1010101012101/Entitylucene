Using PdfLatex in OS X? <body> This thread here mentions MacTex but it is 2 GB in size and I am trying to find something as small as Apple's codeopen/code command for modularized preview. How can I get something like pdflatex in OS X? Something like open-style modularized codecreate/code for OS X?  <answer72270> Try BasicTeX which includes pdflatex and all the usual tools, but is only 64M.
