iPad sync by iTunes works with Lion but not Snow Leopard <body> When I hook up my new iPad to my MacBook Pro (running Snow Leopard) with iTunes, I can sync contacts and my calendar but not music or podcasts.  There is no error message, it just doesn't transfer the data.  I have checked the boxes saying that I want to sync music and podcasts.  I have an alternate boot partition that lets me boot with Lion while using the same home folder.  When booted into Lion, iTunes does transfer the audio files.  But I usually use Snow Leopard, so I'd like to get it working there.  I'm using iTunes 10.6.1 on both OS versions.  Oh, I also have an iPod Nano, and that gets music and podcasts under Snow Leopard with no problem.
