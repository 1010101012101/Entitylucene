Trying to get & use image processing toolbox (IPCV) for Scilab (Version 6) on macOS Sierra <body> Trying to get &amp; use image processing toolbox (IPCV) on macOS Sierra: Can do this on Windows (inside VirtualBox) and continually on Fedora 25 {it (Scilab)complains about missing "Saxon.Jar"} [again using VirtualBox]. Clearly this is not ideal; what I've done is downloaded the toolbox but it won't respond to AtomsInstall, either by the command line and/or the GUI. Help?
