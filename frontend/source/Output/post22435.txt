Disable volume control noise on mac book pro? <body> When I hit F11 or F12 (volume up and volume down) I get the volume control overlay; the volume increases or decreases; and the machine makes an "SQUICK SQUICK SQUICK" noise.  How do I keep the functionality of the keys but stop them making that noise?  (Mac Book Pro with Snow Leopard)  <answer22436> You can change this in System Preferences.  Go to the Sound pane, and uncheck the codePlay feedback when volume is changed/code checkbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUr7O.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also, if you want to not play the sound for a given change (a one-off thing), hold down kbdshift/kbd and change the volume.br This will also play the sound if it's turned off.  <comment24915> I have no idea what tags should go on this, so please suggest or edit them!! thanks. <comment24942> A little off-topic, but you can also do micro adjustments to the volume by holding down both shift and option while hitting the volume keys.  (Removed in Lion, unfortunately) <comment27278> That dang SQUICK sound annoyed the heck out of me, too. I turned it off a long time ago! <comment87237> They must have added 1/4 adjustments back into ML, because it works for me.
