How can I change the language for automatic spelling correction? <body> I set my input source to be strongUS English/strong. And the flag showing on the taskbar is also an American flag.  But whenever I type something in codeMail.app/code or codeNotes.app/code the spell check still corrects my spelling to strongBritish English/strong:  ul lie.g. it highlights my "strongorganize/strong" and suggest s"strongorganise/strong"./li /ul  Please, how to make my Mac (OS X 10.8) an American?  <answer57884> For OS X 10.8:  strongSystem Preferences  Languages &amp; Text  Text  Spelling/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lqvkN.png" alt="image of control"  Or for OS X 10.9 and later:  strongSystem Preferences  Keyboard  Text  Spelling/strong  <answer62551> To add to what gentmatt said, in the case you need to keep "Automatic by Language" because you happen to write in different languages, click on "Set Up…" in the list shown for the Spelling option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gmBFS.png" alt="screenshot"  On the dialog box that appears, you can change the order for the languages. In my case, this is the order I chose.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zD9FV.png" alt="screenshot"  Now, I can write emorganize/em, and the word is not corrected, nor do I get a suggestion for writing emorganise/em. (It happens that emorganise/em is shown as incorrect.)  <answer111759> In Mavericks (10.9):  System Preferences - Keyboard - Text - Spelling  or  System Preferences - Language &amp; Region - Keyboard Preferences - Text - Spelling  <answer118671> Autocorrect with multiples languages (automatic by language) in Mavericks is broken. It does not underline all the bad written words. I have to select only 1 language to get it properly working.   <comment100256> and for snow lep? <comment131389> This should be a comment or an edit adding to a previous answer as it is the same just via a different menu route <comment141486> In Mavericks, you can get there via System Preferences - Keyboard - Text - Spelling (or Language & Region - Keyboard Preferences - Text - Spelling). <comment170486> Actually, it was helpful to me having this as a separate answer as the previous answer references the non-existent (in Mavericks) UX path "System Preferences → Languages & Text → Text → Spelling" path. <comment189042> Evidence? I'm not finding this to be the case. <comment230181> This is what I needed! Thank you!
