How to prevent Mail creating a local Sent Messages folder <body> I have a Gmail account in Mail.app that behaves a bit weird: whenever I send an email, Mail tells me that it created a local "Sent Messages" folder and changed my settings.  The sent email messages are correctly saved in the Sent Items on the Gmail server (this is the behavior I want), but they are also saved in this local folder. Is there a way to prevent Mail creating this local folder and save sent messages strongonly on the server/strong?  <answer76879> Select Gmail's codeSent/code folder, then go to codeMailbox &gt; Use This Mailbox For &gt; Sent/code.
