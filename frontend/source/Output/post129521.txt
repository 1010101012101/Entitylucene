Recorded song in GarageBand and uploaded to iCloud but file now missing from phone <body> Earlier today, I recorded a song and uploaded it to the iCloud.  I want to edit it on my MacBook Air (OS X Mavericks) and then send it back to my iPhone, but the file on my iPhone just disappeared?  <answer129599> I found some instructions that might help you with your problem.     When you want to send a song to iCloud, tap on the Edit button and   select a song (or songs). With iCloud enabled in the app, you will now   see an iCloud icon along the top bar. Tapping on the iCloud icon will   bring up a prompt, asking if you want to send the song(s) to iCloud.      After the song is uploaded to iCloud, you will see an iCloud logo in   the top-right corner of the song thumbnail, indicating a successful   upload and the fact that the song is stored in the cloud.   <answer261949> I did this the other way round. I had a file stored on iCloud. I opened the song in GarageBand and closed it by saving it on my iPhone. Then I selected the file after downloading the file from iCloud and selected "Remove from iCloud". After doing so, I was very disappointed since the music composition was nearly finished ... BUT ... somehow I had an old version on my iPhone after selecting "Remove from iCloud". Nearly have a week of work disappeared. Storing the files on the iPhone memory seems to cause LESS trouble since I always have a security backup every time I connect my iPhone to iTunes to make a backup on my hardisk.  That's a really DISAPPOINTING experience!  PS: And strangely, I wasn't even able to open some files stored on iCloud. Only the first file worked. I had to install three times Garageband from the app store to make it working. A really FRUSTRATING experience!  <comment151587> is your file still on iCloud? <comment151603> Yes,it is now on my iCloud  but I want to record more tracks on my phone, so I want to get them back... <comment151614> so what is preventing you to move it from iCloud to your phone? <comment151656> Sorry!! I just couldn't figure out the right STEP to move it back to my iPhone!! <comment328122> Welcome to Ask Different!
