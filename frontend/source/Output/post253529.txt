Songs in my library "cannot be played on this iphone" anymore <body> After updating to iOS 10, most of the songs in my library that I could play before now won't sync and the error message I get is      Some of the items in the iTunes library, including "Song name", were not copied to the iPhone "iPhone name" because they cannot be played on this iPhone.   But I could play these items before, nothing has changed.   When I check the media format of one of the items it just says:  ul likind: MPEG audio file/li libit rate: 320 kbps/li lisample rate: 44.100 kHz/li lichannels: Joint stereo/li liencoded with: LAME3.99/li liformat: MPEG-1, Layer 3/li /ul  From what I know this is just an MP3 with constant bitrate, a format that the iphone did support one week ago...  <answer253538> I disabled iCloud Music, Music Match, and all that stuff from the iphone, turned it off, turned it back on again, and now everything syncs fine...
