How can I skip the Welcome screen after installing OS X? <body> How can I skip the Welcome Video/Music that comes up after a fresh install of OS X? I believe you could skip this in Windows by hitting kbdESC/kbd, but I cannot find a key that has that same effect in OS X.  <answer178> Try pressing kbdcmd/kbd+kbdq/kbd. Itâ€™s a Quicktime movie after all.  <answer182> Unfortunately you can not skip the opening movie - but you can skip the registration process which shows up later by pressing kbdCommand/kbd-kbdQ/kbd. When the Setup process is complete the file code.AppleSetupDone/code shows up in code/var/db/code. (If this file exists it will skip the Setup process altogether)  <comment115> The Esc key is OS X is exactly in the same place it would be on Windows, right above backtick/tilde. <comment118> @NReilingh: I think he meant "a key with the same effect". <comment353> yes, i just meant the ESC key has no effect. <comment17748> no, it does not work.
