iPhone 5s - can't click on top voicemail/phone number/search bar! <body> I have a very strange problem with my phone that started a few days ago. I am not able to click on the "top element" in program, for example the most recent call, voicemail, search bar in email app, etc. I am sure this is not a screen issue, because I can click on apps located in the same area and the screen is otherwise responsive. I am completely confused - could anyone help? I have restarted the phone multiple times with no success.
