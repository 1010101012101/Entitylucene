Bridge Adapter with wifi interface does not assign a local IP to VM <body> ul liIt is strongOS X El-Capitan 10.11.6/strong  ,/li liI have VirtualBox em5.0.20/em , /li liI have also CentOS VM is installed by Virtualbox ./li /ul  When I connect the real machine (Mac) via strongcable/strong (RJ45 or USB[hotspot] ), Bridge adapter works like a charm: the VM reaches internet and codehostname -I/code displays its local IP which is accessible .  When I connect via strongWi-Fi/strong , and I choose Bridge Adapter and select the WIFI interface , it does not work : The VM does not reach internet, codehostname -I/code displays nothing.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IRJJi.png" alt="enter image description here"  MY concern is not only "VM reaches internet" but also , the real machine can access via browser the installed app under VM.    That's why, I don't care about other adapters (NAT, ...) unless it satisfied my needs :  ol liAccessing app installed in VM  from the real machine (Mac)./li liVM reaches internet/li /ol  <comment330000> If you have no DHCP server in your Wi-FI network simply configure a fixed IP in the VM guest in the same IP-network as the host! If you run a server in your Linux VM a fixed IP is strongly recommended.
