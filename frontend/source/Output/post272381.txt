Why are my menu bars always on my left monitor? <body> I have a Macbook running OSx and have two external monitors plugged in. Unlike for all my colleagues, whichever app I use, in whichever monitor, the menu bar will always be in the top of the lefthand monitor.   This is obviously very annoying when using an app in the right-hand monitor or Macbook screen.  How do I get menu to appear on the same monitor as the app? I've found reference to something called Secondbars but supposedly the need for this was going to disappear in Mavericks.  <answer272382> It depends entirely on one pref...  System prefs  Mission Control  Displays have separate Spaces.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hoq0D.png" alt="enter image description here"  This will, however, completely change other aspects of your workflow.br The dock will always be present on each screen; you can no longer use screens in pairs, each is independent, so changing Spaces on one screen doesn't take the other with it; you can't have the same Space on both screens at once, but you can invert the left/right order of Spaces by swapping each on the other screen, via a 3rd Space.  Personally, as you can probably tell, I hate it ;-)  <comment342353> +1 for hating it... of all the ways they could have made Spaces work better on multiple displays, they had to pick this one :/ <comment342369> Thanks. I don't really use Spaces (unchecking the option you mention was probably my attempt to disable them) so ticking this causes me no problems and solves the original problem!
