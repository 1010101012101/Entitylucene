Droplet with a progress bar? <body> First of all, apologies for my ignorance on the subject. All of this ffmpeg and automation is new for me and sometimes I cannot see even evident things.   I am learning command lines to encode videos (I use FFMPEG to change settings of the video, watermark, all this sort of things to improve my workflow)   Now I am trying to transform those command lines in to Applescript droplets apps to make life easier. Last night I managed to turn my first one in an Applescript app droplet but I am missing the progress which I can see when I use the command shell.  I.E.  I can see frames per second, how much inside de video ... this sort of info  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ALa3H.png" alt="progress I can see if using the script on terminal window"  I would like to know if there is a way to modify / add something on this script to see similar progress, either tell terminal to open while executing the script or a detailed progress bar pop up.   This is the scrip I am currently starting with  precodefor f in "$@" do  /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg -i "$f" -vf "drawtext=fontfile=/Library/Fonts/Tahoma.ttf: text='Central Text':\ x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h-line_h)/2: fontsize=100: fontcolor=white@0.2" -s 720x406 -c:v libx264 -b:v 1400k -pix_fmt yuv420p -b:a 192k "${f%.*}_watermarked.mov" done /code/pre  <answer177175> If you want to just have terminal open and run you can get an idea from below.  It is not very neat but works of sorts..  example:  precodeon open myFiles         set bigList to {}         repeat with i from 1 to number of items in myFiles             set this_item to item i of myFiles             copy (quoted form of POSIX path of this_item) &amp; space to end of bigList         end repeat      tell application "Terminal"               do script ("for f in  " &amp; items of bigList as string) &amp; "     do      echo  \"$f\"      done"          end tell end open /code/pre  <comment209384> And what do you have in your droplet <comment209386> Also have a look at https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/AppleScript/RN-AppleScript/RN-10_10/RN-10_10.html <comment209430> @markhunte , The droplet is the code pasted above. I am sorry, I think didn't understand your question. <comment209434> Just thought you could show the droplet code including the Applescript. I do not think using native Applescript at least you will get this type of verbose feed back to use in a progress bar. You could iterate each file as it changes to the next one in the bath. <comment209444> @markhunte I would assume the droplet code is just a wrapper script that executes the shell script shown above. <comment209448> @markhunte in that case is there a way to add on the script something telling to open terminal and execute the action? I wound't mind to have the terminal window open for executing the procedure. <comment209449> ps* thank you for your help @markhunte
