How to open current folder in ForkLift from command line? <body> I know how to open it in Finder:  precodeopen . /code/pre  But, how can I open it in ForkLift?  <answer274081> Use following command:  precodeopen -a ForkLift . /code/pre  <comment344547> Sorry, I tried it - didn't work out. Maybe, cuz I'm using old version ^^ <comment344783> Hi, I'm using ForkLift 3.0. Could you provide error message or any other response from the system? <comment344927> 2.6.6, I don't get any errors - it just open ForkLift with default folder "Downloads" :) I run the command in iTerm & Terminal and in different directories, but still it starts ForkLift only with "Downloads" directory as active one.
