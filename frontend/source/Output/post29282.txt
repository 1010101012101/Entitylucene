Can I download apps from the US app store if I'm using a different store? <body> Can I download apps from the US apps Store even if I'm currently using the italian store ?  For example, I would like to download Spotify, which is not available in the Italian store:  Should I change credit card? Or can I use the same one?  <answer29294> You will need to create an account on the US store.  Apple probably won't accept your foreign credit card either (at least they do not in Canada), so you need US gift cards to create an account.  Google for more information.  <answer29296> To expand on EmmEff answer, we do this in  South AFrica quite often.  ul liRegister a US account using a valid US Address (The US Yellow Pages Helps)/li liDo not register a credit card/li liDownload free apps, books, music etc. /li liPurchase US iTunes gift cards online and load onto account/li liBuy software, books and music./li /ul  subPlease note, South Africa has a severely restricted App Store, and we cannot purchase games, music or books any other way, and due to legal issues with classification of items, will most likely never be able too/sub  <comment33636> Thanks, what about using paypal instead of gift cards ? <comment33639> @Patrick As long as it's a US paypal account it will be fine. Apple checks countries quite strictly. <comment33788> I've decided to buy an US gift card. Should I buy it on the Apple website ? And how can I reveice it in Netherlands rather than US ? <comment33789> How do I get US gift cards in Europe ? <comment33790> I see only 2 solutions: to buy them on ebay or another website and ask to ship to europe, to ask a friend to buy them in US and pass me the code.
