I can connect to internet only in Safe Mode <body> I'm having serious internet issues with my Mac (10.11.6 El Capitan). When I boot in safe mode I can connect to the Internet. But after a normal boot I cannot.  On normal mode I can ping codegoogle.com/code but I cannot browse nor codecurl/code. I cannot talk to a strongserver running on localhost/strong either!  I think I connected to a bad Wi-Fi in a hotel but apart from that I didn't change any configuration files myself.  strongWhat I've tried/strong  ul liI checked that the values given by system preferences/network/advanced are the same in safe mode and normal mode./li liConfigure IPv4 is set to "Using DHCP" and "Configure IPv6" is set to "Automatically"./li liI don't have any proxy/li liI compared Activity Monitor processes in normal and safe mode. Seems OK (only difference are a few more running processes in normal mode)/li liI removed files from /Library/LaunchAgents and .../LaunchDaemons etc./li liI have unloaded/loaded mDNSResponder.plist /li /ul  What can I do at this point? Thanks in advance I have been stuck for days.  <comment356677> Create a standard or administrator user account and test the network. Write back with your results. <comment356678> I concur with @IconDaemon - The part that jumps out is that you can't connect to a local server which, on initial reaction sounds like you have some sort of proxy installed/configured or something with your firewall may be (mis)configured. <comment356682> Please download and run [Etrecheck](https://etrecheck.com/), create a full report (including Apple stuff) and upload it somewhere (GoogleDrive/Dropbox etc) so we can download it. I think it's too large to post it here. <comment356690> Do you have any Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware programs installed? If yes, try turning them all off and see if you can browse. <comment356716> @klanomath So just after running Etrecheck... internet worked again. Unbelievable. Thanks for the help <comment356721> @Thomas Etrecheck is just an (almost non-invasive) diagnostics tool which creates a diagnostic report similar to System Information.app - with a different focus though. So Etrecheck is **not** the solution! <comment356724> @klanomath that's my belief too but after days of fighting with the computer this is the last action before seeing internet work again. I did that first before creating another user as suggested so couldn't test that. I wanted to let next users with this pain know just in case
