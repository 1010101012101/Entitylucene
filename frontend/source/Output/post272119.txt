Time Machine Backups taking too much space? <body> Yesterday, I installed an external hard disk for my Time Machine — well, a 1.6Tb partition of a 2Tb hard disk. I am running a new iMac with 512Gb SSD. The internal drive is about half full.  After a day, I have about 5 backups, and I find that I only have 448Gb available.  I am still trying to get the other folder sizes (understandably, this is taking a long time), but the first backup folder is about 250Gb. At a rough estimate, this suggests that the subsequent backups are about the same size. At this rate, I will run out by tomorrow.  I understood that the Time Machine backups are sort of differential, and that subsequent backups are mostly links to the original backup files.  The question is: is the size, being mis-reported, or is that a correct estimate of the space used?  <answer272121> I would probably do two things:   ol liLet time machine run until it fills up the 1.6 TB and then see how long a windows you have. macOS will clean up the destination - purging old files as needed. /li liUse codetmutil compare/code or a tool like backupLoupe to check what is taking the space. Other tools do a lousy job of showing you actual space usage in time machine.   ul liWhy does Time Machine estimate a 109GB backup size, but then need 235 GB?/li liTime Machine - List of Files that were backed up/li /ul/li /ol  <comment342033> Nice answer - I always think of Time Machine as simply "taking up all the space that's available" & make volume sizes appropriately. <comment342035> Thanks @bmike. I’ll try out your suggestions and get back as soon as I have more info. <comment342041> Sounds good @Manngo . A follow on question and link it here in a comment and I'll see it. Look for large database files - you'll want to exclude them and find another way to back them up or shard them (VMware and Parallels both have info on that for example)
