I've lost the ability to sideload apps onto iOS 6 - iPhone 4s from iTunes 12 <body> strongIssue &amp; Question:/strong I've lost the ability to add apps to an iPhone 4S through iTunes ever since the last update; does anyone know if there is a block on loading apps onto iPhone 4S now? Also, what is a great workaround for this issue?  strongSteps that I have tried taking:/strong   ol liConnect iPhone 4S to Mac/li liOpen iTunes/li liSelect the iPhone 4S in iTunes' header/li liSelect "Apps" on the sidebar/li liCmd + O, or File  "Add to Library..."/li liSelect the .ipa file/li liThe app propagates in the list of apps/li liClick "Install" next to the app name/li liClick "Apply" in the bottom corner of the window/li /ol  strongResult:/strong When the app finishes downloading, a dialog appears on the iPhone 4S: "strongiTunes Sync/strong -- '[app name]' failed to install."  strongWhat Does Work:/strong I am able to load apps this way onto iOS 7 and iOS 8 (even though I could choose to use TestFlight on iOS 8).  strongBonus Facts:/strong I'm running iTunes 12.1.2.27 on OS X Yosemite. The patch notes don't explicitly say that iOS 6 support was dropped  <comment216750> Your question title refers to iOS 6, but your question detail implies you are using iOS 7  and 8. Are you talking about different devices? Does your question really mean you're running iTunes 12, on Yo, and you cannot upload apps to an iOS 6 system? Could you please explain a bit more? <comment216876> @DavidDelMonte: I mentioned 7 and 8 as iOS versions that *do* work. I'll edit my question to clarify the steps that I am taking to attempt to sideload the app. <comment316915> I would like to know as well if iOS 6 is supported on iTunes 12.
