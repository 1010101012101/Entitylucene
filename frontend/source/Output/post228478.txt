How can I type the “@” symbol via VNC with a PC keyboard? <body> I'm connecting from a PC to a Mac via VNC. Now I want to enter some special characters like @. How can I do that?  This page didn't help. Other keyboard shortcuts I found out:  kbdAlt/kbd = kbdcmd/kbd  kbdShift/kbd + kbd7/kbd = _  kbdShift/kbd + kbd-/kbd = ?  I'm using a German keyboard, but it seems that the English keyboard layout is used by VNC, because kbdy/kbd is kbdz/kbd. The clipboard also don't seem to work correctly ...  emEdit:/em  strongPhysical keyboard layout PC/strong: German keyboard layout “T1” according to DIN 2137-1:2012-06  strongLogical keyboard layout PC/strong: German  strongVNC mapping/strong  strongLogical keyboard layout Mac/strong: German  strongPhysical keyboard layout Mac/strong: German  <answer228490> From the menu bar select System Preferences  Select the Keyboard Icon   Select the Keyboard tab  Select the "Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in menu bar" check box.

Is there a possibility to choose the keyboard layout? I didn't fully understand your last point. <comment278586> Ok so not a mac keyboard - my comment was really based on US/UK PC and Mac keyboards swapping " and @  - Given your response try pressing the Ä key I would also try with and without shift and the key to the right of   Ä https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout <comment278593> `Ä = r` and `Shift + Ä = F` and `# = §` and `Shift + # = ä`. Strange behavior ... <comment278600> Have you tried the on screen keyboard? <comment278601> @DavidAnderson: No. How can I select the @ here? I have enabled the software keyboard, but currently I don't know how to select the @ sign. <comment278602> @testing please add the (logical) input source on the OS X side <comment278603> @klanomath: What do you mean with input source? I'm typing with a PC keyboard (german layout) over VNC on a Mac. <comment278605> Actually, I like the character view better. <comment278606> @testing 1. physical keyboard layout PC - 2. logical keyboard layout PC ~ 3. VNC - 4. logical keyboard layout Mac  (- 5. physical keyboard layout Mac) The last one is not relevant. 1: german 2: probably german 3. VNC mapping. The fourth one is missing. <comment278607> How do you select the @ sign with the keyboard viewer? The characters disappears after pressing the Alt key... <comment278609> @testing: Can you hold down the Alt key on your "real" keyboard then select a key on the "virtual"l keyboard? I know I can do this, but I am not using VNC. <comment278610> @klanomath: The fourth is also German. But I think the VNC mapping uses the English keyboard. <comment278611> OK, while holding the Windows I can select the @ sign!
