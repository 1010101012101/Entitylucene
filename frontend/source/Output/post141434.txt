Can't close the lid on macbook air while using windows 8 <body> I installed windows on a macbook air, and it works fine, except that when I close the lid, and open it the screen is black, but when I tried to press the touchpad, I hear the sound of windows error. I tried to press the power button, and it showed windows 8 startup screen, then the grey screen with mac startup sounds, and after that there was windows 8 loading screen again. How do I make windows just sleep when closing the lid?  <comment166708> Check your power settings under "Advanced Power Settings - Advanced Settings - Power Button and Lid - Lid close action".
