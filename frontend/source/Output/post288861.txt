How to ignore particular USB device given a vid and pid? <body> I'm running Sierra v10.12.5. I'm trying to flash an stm32f100 chip using openocd. As per the documentation:     For info the original ST-LINK enumerates using the mass storage usb class; however, its implementation is completely broken. The result is this causes issues under Linux. The simplest solution is to get Linux to ignore the ST-LINK using one of the following methods:      ul   limodprobe -r usb-storage &amp;&amp; modprobe usb-storage quirks=483:3744:i /li   liadd "options usb-storage quirks=483:3744:i" to /etc/modprobe.conf/li   /ul   I tested this solution on an Ubuntu machine and it works. Now I'd like to replicate this on a Mac but I can't seem to find any information on how to do this.  <answer288901> codemodprobe/code does not exist in macOS / OS X as it is a Linux-specific program.  The macOS equivalent is codekextload/code.  Have you tried to use pystlink to flash your chip?
