Is there an alternative to touch-automation than AutoTouch? <body> I want to automate repetitive actions for a game on my (jailbroken) iPhone 4. I hesitate to mention the name of the game in case you would be abetting me in violation of its Terms of Service (ToS) by automation, but its player-base recommends replaying the tutorial to reroll an early game RNG element. The tutorial is easy but time-consuming, making it a prime target for automation. I stumbled across AutoTouch in the Cydia store, but it requires purchasing a license to run scripts for longer than a minute or some-length and I am skeptical of its performance. So, is there an (preferably cheaper) alternative to touch-automation than AutoTouch?  <answer155488> I don't think there are any other option (cheaper) that I've heard of.  Most of the unique tweaks in the jailbreak world are always priced high.  You should probably tweet to the developer @KentKrantz and ask him about AutoTouch performance on iPhone 4 running iOS7 or maybe ask him for a trial license after which if you're interested you could buy the full license for strong$5/strong which doesn't seem a lot.
