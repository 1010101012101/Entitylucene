Client side DHCP log <body> Is there a dhcp logfile available in osx (snow leopard or lion) where I can see when a new ip-address was received from the DHCP server?  <answer56753> OS X doesn't log this sort of information by default to one central file.  You will get a configd message in the strong/private/var/log/system.log/strong that the network configuration has changed.  precodeJul 18 11:06:54 mac configd[15]: network configuration changed. /code/pre  Also, the kernel will log several messages - including the base station MAC address in the case of Wi-Fi networks - that are easily viewed in the Console utility.  precode7/18/12 11:06:28.000 AM kernel: wlEvent: en1 en1 Link DOWN virtIf = 0 7/18/12 11:06:28.000 AM kernel: AirPort: Link Down on en1.

You should be able to use the console to debug this if you have a DHCP server that you can force (or simply observe) a renewal or DHCP change when the network connection itself remains stable. The messages above were from a manual forcing off of Wi-Fi and then back on.  The current DHCP status is logged in clear text to strong/private/var/db/dhcpd_leases/strong and the last lease for each network interface appears to be logged to strong/private/var/db/dhcpclient/strong with a dated file beginning with enX.  It seems plausible you could use the strongtmutil/strong compare function to detect a change to this file if just knowing the last successful lease time was not what you wanted.  precodemac:db mike$ tmutil compare /private/var/db/dhcpclient/leases .... /code/pre
