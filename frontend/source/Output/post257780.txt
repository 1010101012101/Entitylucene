IPhone 6 iOS 10.0.2 <body> I get group text, and there is nothing at the bottom of the group text that allows me the option to respond. When I go into details every option is graded out. The very top has Name of group text. I can see all the contact information listed in the group text, but everything is grated out. Send My Current. Share My Location. Do Not Disturb. Leave this Conversation. I didn't always have this problem and can't figure out why it is happening now. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks  <comment322042> Could you share a screenshot?
