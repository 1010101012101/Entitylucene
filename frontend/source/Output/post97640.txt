Gmail App on iOS shows badge count for unread Chats <body> At times, the Gmail app for iOS can display a hard-to-remove badge. The badge corresponds to a gchat message that was received offline. The badge is considered difficult to remove due to a series of facts:  ol ligchat sends an 'email' to your Gmail when you receive an offline message/li ligchat messages do not show up in any inbox in the Gmail app; they're only visible in the browser/li liThe "Chats" label does not show up in the side bar of the Gmail app, so there is no easy way to access the chats/li liSearching for "label:chats" only finds chats up to June 7th. Maybe they released an update then that stopped sending chats to iOS devices?/li liBeing online 24/7 (for instance, using the Hangouts app) is not a good solution, as I do not want to be online 24/7./li /ol  The question is: is there any way to make this badge less annoying?  Possibilities:  ol liCan you make the Chats label appear in the iOS app?/li liCan you make chats not send emails when you're offline?/li liCan you make chats received offline not count as unread?/li /ol  My "Notifications" setting is set to "Primary Only." This affects both my iPhone and iPad.  <answer188486> Inbox by Gmail solves this annoying issue! I've switched over my personal email accounts, and haven't had any problems since.
