Hidden gems or tricks in OS X Yosemite (10.10) <body> In addition to this question I'd like to start a new question specifically for the new OS X Yosemite.   As I'm always curious about the announced items, there are many times hidden gems or nice tricks in new OS X versions.  Please share your hidden tricks (emone per answer/em)! Please do not add "default" tricks which are available in all previous versions.  <answer150966> Using strongcurrency calculator directly in Spotlight/strong by typing in a number and a currency.

Very inconsistent. <comment177654> Yes, what's different between this one and the older question? <comment177655> @Rnhmjoj This one is less broad than the other one, as this is only Yosemite. So I don't know - just waiting for it to be reopened. <comment177677> @Rob Sorry, I think I haven't been clear. I think there is no reason why this should be on hold while the other is ok. <comment177696> @mbc I mean I don't understand why it is "too broad". I think this kind of question are really useful. <comment177718> @Rnhmjoj We agree, Iâ€™ve misunderstood you then. <comment182107> If the currency you're interested in is not listed you can for example type "4 eur in aud" to get Australian Dollars.
