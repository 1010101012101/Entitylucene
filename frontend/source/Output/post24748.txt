rEFIt menu takes around 10 seconds to even show up <body> I'm using a macbook pro 8,1. I've installed rEFIt so that I can dual boot with Ubuntu. This is all "working" except that each time I turn on my laptop, it takes ten or fifteen seconds to even get to the rEFIt menu for me to select an OS.  At this point, I have done nothing special except to make Ubuntu the default OS and reduce the wait time in the rEFIt menu from 20 to 5 seconds.  How can I reduce this lag between startup and OS selection?  <answer24759> Assuming you have rEFIt installed on one of the partitions on the hard drive, the following steps should remove the delay:  ul liBoot via the Mac OS X Install DVD/USB./li liLaunch Terminal (Utilities Menu)./li liEnter codediskutil list/code to list all available disks and partitions./li liLooking at the list of partitions for "disk0" (internal drive), identify the partition that contains your rEFIt boot files./li liEnter codebless --setBoot --device /dev/disk0s2 --legacy/code assuming that "/dev/disk0s2" was the rEFIt partition./li liEnter codereboot/code to reboot your Mac/li /ul  Your Mac should now boot to rEFIt with a minimal delay.  The same method also works with Windows 7 direct booting (Boot Camp) which can present an extremely long boot delay on MacBook Airs and Minis if Windows 7 is your startup disk and the above steps have not been taken.
