How can I require a user to change their password? <body> I created a new account on a machine and gave it a default password but I want to ensure the user changes the password when they log into it for the first time. It's just a laptop with nothing special running client version of Mac OS X 10.6.8.  I'm sure it's possible, I remember seeing a check box where you could require the user to change their password at some point.   Could someone refresh my memory on this or tell me how to achieve this goal?  <answer29120> Found on Apple Support Communities.

Mac OS Server, ...? There's not a lot people can don't with the information you just gave us. <comment33471> I'm not on a Mac right now, so I can't test or post screenshot. Also, there's a solution with "Server Admin" on the link I posted, but I think this on is only when it's a "network account". <comment33472> this looks like it will only work with server <comment33486> @mcgrailm, it will work without server as long as you target it to server "localhost".
