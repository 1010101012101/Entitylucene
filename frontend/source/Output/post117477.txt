Looking for an alternative browser that doesn't leak memory nor my data, and is secure <body> lately I have been using Firefox. It works rather well, but given my browsing habits (I never close down Firefox, I rarely reboot my macbook) I end up with an instance of Firefox that eats up 2/3 GB of RAM.  This is obviously unacceptable, and Firefox is well known to have memory leaks here and there. On the long run, "here and there" bogs down my machine and I need to close it down (when it doesn't crash) and restart it, and since I don't save things in the browsers (password, forms ecc) I need to re-login everywhere. :(  On the other hand I am concerned with Chrome and Safari, since I don't want history on my browser, nor want to provide data about a person (me) to third parties (via cookies, history, habits, tracking, whatever). So no Safari, no Chrome.  I don't know about Opera, but I never used it: I have always been curious, and I will download it today.  So here's the question: given all of the previous information, which is the browser safe, not-leaking-memory and that respects my privacy that you would advise me to use?  Thanks!  <answer117481> Use Safari or Chrome in Private Browsing or Incognito mode, and set Do Not Track.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G2roz.png" width="300"  <answer118228> Chrome is a data mining operation, pure and simple. It's based on Chromium, however, which is less intrusive and can use all the Chrome add-ons -- though many of those are deceptive and are actually trackers, adware and malware. This is why I stick to Firefox.  <comment137274> Why don't you have the same concerns about Safari/Chrome with Firefox or Opera? <comment137277> Firefox I can control, via several controls I know well. So far I haven't used Opera, but they have clear statements about what they use and what they not (the fact they respect them is a different matter entirely). <comment137291> You don't even need to set Incognito mode in Chrome; just go into the settings and shut everything off.  You can even forego assigning a Google account to Chrome if you like.  If you really want a pristine browser, use a copy of VirtualBox and snapshot the OS, do your browsing there, and revert to the snapshot upon shutdown.  Or use a browser like `elinks` or `w3m`. <comment137368> while elinks and w3m are incredibly useful on remote machines they are not really useful on a variety of websites which employ something more than html+css (think javascript, for example). On the other hand, the idea of snapshotting and reverting a VBox VM is not so bad :) Thanks!
