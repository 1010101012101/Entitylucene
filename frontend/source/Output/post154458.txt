Remove "steamclean" application <body> Through my high school I have a Macbook Air. Because I am the technologically curious person that I am, I found a workaround for installing apps by putting them in the package contents of other apps (i.e. Google Chrome). I did this with Steam. After doing this, they found out about it and cleared out all of the apps' package contents.  They don't specifically know that I did this, but now every time I restart my computer a pop-up comes up saying that I don't have permission to run "steamclean".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjlEY.png" alt="Screenshot of steamclean error"  I really don't want this to come up if they are trying to help me with my laptop if I have issues with it. Any suggestions?  <answer154466> Open the Terminal application and type (or copy and paste) the following command and hit ENTER. This will remove the steamclean job and should stop those popup messages.     launchctl remove com.valvesoftware.steamclean   You may also want to run the following command to check for other Steam related launchd jobs.     launchctl list | grep steam   On my own Mac there is another called "com.valvesoftware.steam.ipctool" that you may also want to remove.  <comment181741> @AlistairMcMillan Here's the screenshot: [link](http://i1308.photobucket.com/albums/s618/bojo1498/ScreenShot2014-11-03at104448_zpsfbd0777d.png) <comment181742> Seems like the problem is still happening...
