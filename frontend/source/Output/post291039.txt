df -h yielding what looks like a strange output: /home, /dev, and /net have 0% free space <body> I have a MacBook Pro with 1 TB of disk space.  When I run codedf -h/code I get the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a2YKQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  It tells me I have 702 GiB available on / which I suspect is true -- but nothing on /home.  Do I have a virus or something?  <answer291047> You could have a virus or not, but the codedf/code listing is 100% legitimate and normal.
