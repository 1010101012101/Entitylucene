Mavericks Terminal - 'Command Not Found' for everything <body> About everything (even clear and open) is giving 'Command Not Found' on the Terminal.  If I do and echo $PATH, it gives me this. /Users/username/Documents/android/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Users/merck/Documents/android/android-sdk-macosx/tools  The /.profile file is not even there in the Finder.  The environment.plist file in .MacOSX has this value. bplist00â€”_SENCHA_CMD_3_0_0_$/Users/username/bin/Sencha/Cmd/4.0.2.67E  Can anyone give some pointers.  <answer136207> Look in the .bashrc file, and see if anything towards the end is overwriting (rather than appending to) the $PATH ...  I am guessing that the Android SDK b0rked it somehow.  <comment161505> There are already several questions covering situations like this, for instance http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69721/mac-os-x-terminal-commands-not-found and http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83024/terminal-returns-not-found-for-most-commands-mac-osx.
