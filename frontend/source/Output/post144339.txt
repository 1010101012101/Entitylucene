Update PHP in shell and install Mcrypt <body> I want to update to PHP 5.6 in shell (via Terminal) before I want to install the Mcrypt extension  I followed this tutorial:     http://justinhileman.info/article/reinstalling-php-on-mac-os-x/   But when I do all of that and I type in codephp -v/code it still says PHP 5.4.24.  And when I install the Mcrypt extension with this tutorial:     http://jenssegers.be/blog/49/installing-the-php-mcrypt-extension-on-osx-10-9-mavericks   (I used PHP 5.6 instead of 5.4)   I still cannot install Laravel (that's why I'm doing this). It still gives me an error      Mcrypt PHP extension required Script php artisan clear-compiled handling the post-install-cmd event returned with an error   What can I do?  <answer148674> The easiest solution for your problem is: (I don't know you experience with the terminal so just humor me if I take you for an unexperienced user)  precodewhich php /code/pre  This will give you the php binary that is used. Use your Terminal and go to that folder:  precodecd /path/that/whichphp/gives/you /code/pre  When you punch you way to the folder do this:  ol licodesudo mv php php.old/code &lt;- rename the old php binary to back it up (just in case :) )/li licodesudo ln -s /path/to/the/new/php/binary php/code &lt;- This will create a symlink that points to your new php binary/li /ol  Easiest way to locate all your php instances and identifying the new one would be:  precodesudo find / -name php /code/pre  After you create the symlink write codephp -v/code again into the console and you should see the version output from you new instance.  If you still have problems just contact me.  I hope this helped you : had the same problem as you once :)  <comment356094> This seems promising, but even using `sudo`, I got the message `Operation not permitted.`
