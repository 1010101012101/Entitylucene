Equalizing volume of different songs in itunes <body> I have enabled the option to equalize volume but it doesn't seem to do anything. Neither does it work for itunes, nor for the songs on my ipod. Is there some option/setting I am overlooking?  <answer3601> I use an external tool (MP3gain) for this. It works fine without touching the mp3 coding. The linked one is windows only, but there is also a Mac version, if I remember correctly.  <comment3327> thanks, i will check it out. quick question, can i batch modify multiple directories that have about 10K songs :) <comment3328> Yes, that is possible. It even has a feature for live albums or albums where the tracks have no pauses or crossfade. It can analyse the volume for the whole CD (folder) and then lower/raise the volume for each track by the same amount. <comment3332> thanks again, I am going to be using this <comment6862> FYI, in the same vein than mp3gain batch editing, i wrote an Automator action that I use to automatically compute Replay gain for my incoming mp3 files.
