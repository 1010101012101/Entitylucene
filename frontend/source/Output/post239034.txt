Disable semitransparent hidden file icons <body> I have enabled hidden file visibility on OS X El Capitan 10.11, and the files are semitransparent. Is there a way to make them solid like all other files?  <answer239037> You can use codechflags/code to remove hidden flag from files you need:  precodechflags nohidden YourFile /code/pre  Use this command with codeYourFile/code replaced with your file to change the file flag to no hidden. Files and folders with code./code prefix will remain hidden.  <comment293350> I am not wanting to disable the hidden status; just the semitransparent icon that hidden files have.
