What makes an app unique from POV of options -> assign to desktop? <body> What is the set of things that differentiate one application from another from the point of view of right-click on dock icon - Options - Assign To (All Desktops / This Desktop / None)?  I've experimented and haven't been able to hit on a combination of actual binary name / Info.plist values / PkgInfo string that will make Mac OS X workspaces think a duplicated application is different from the original for purposes of automatic desktop assignment.  <answer173845> Found it, just leaving this here to make it easier for others to find answers via google. See:  ul liAssign Application Windows to Different Spaces/Desktops/li liIs there a way to hide certain apps from the cmd+tab menu?/li /ul  Specifically, the one thing you need to care about is CFBundleIdentifier in the app's Contents/Info.plist file. Here is a part from a script that may be useful:  precode  # Change Bundle ID so desktop assignation works. Not sure if this will survive updates.   # CFBundleIdentifier must contain only alphanumeric (A-Z,a-z,0-9), hyphen (-), and period (.) characters.   # (Based on fiddling around there also seems to be a length limit.)   UUID="$(echo $APP | md5sum | awk '{print $1}' | tr [0-9] [A-Z] | cut -c 1-4,29-32)"   plutil -replace CFBundleIdentifier -string "cdi.$UUID" -- "$RUNTIMES/$APP/Contents/Info.plist"   #plutil -replace CFBundleName -string "$APP" -- "$RUNTIMES/$APP/Contents/Info.plist"   #plutil -replace CFBundleDisplayName -string "$APP" -- "$RUNTIMES/$APP/Contents/Info.plist"   # To check: defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.spaces.plist app-bindings /code/pre  To see this in some context, see my answer to this question: Is there a simple way to have separate dock icons for different Chrome Profiles?  <comment204642> OTOH, while the linked pages give some clues about how to solve the problem stated in the question, they don't actually explain *how* to solve it. Can you add this to your answer? <comment204711> Updated answer @patrix hope that that's enough. In any case, it's all I know :-)
