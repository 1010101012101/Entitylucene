Shortcut for showing windows instead of clicking the Dock <body> I use kbdcommand/kbdkbdtab/kbd to browse through my applications, and kbdcommand/kbdkbd`/kbd for browsing through internal windows (e.g. for Firefox).   However, regularly, I switch to an application (e.g. TeXMaker and others) and only the menu bar shows up. They don't have a windows option, so I have to go all the way down to the Dock, find the application (which will have a dot on it) and click it. Then the windows will actually show.   I prefer not to use my mouse for this task. Is there any shortcut for this?  <answer280396> This works for some applications but not for all. You can use TextEdit.app to test it.  ol liOpen TextEdit.app/li liCreate a new document (CMD+N)./li liMinimize the document (manually, CMD+M did not work for me)./li liCMD+Tab to Finder.app/li /ol  Now everything's set up. The following steps may be a bit tricky.  ol listrongCMD+Tab/strong to highlight TextEdit. Keep the strongCMD key pressed/strong./li liKeep the CMD key pressed and strongadditionally press the Alt/strong/Opt key./li listrongRelease the CMD/strong key./li /ol  This will un-minimize only the last window of a certain application. You cannot un-minimize multiple windows without additional scripts/software.  <comment352650> Try using CMD + N <comment352654> @user3439894 Correct, I misunderstood the question. <comment352954> Oh this is excellent.Just tested it on chrome. You have to be sure to keep pressing Alt after you let go of cmd. Thanks!
