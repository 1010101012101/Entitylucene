How to share directory over NFS from Mac? (w/o macOS Server app) <body> First of all, I'm happy to pay the $19.99 for the Mac OS Server app from the app store, so that's no problem, it's just that at the moment I only have one specific need - NFS sharing between my macOS sierra host and a virtualbox VM guest running Debian Sarge (don't ask).  This is something I am used to doing in Linux without any difficulty, but the syntax for code/etc/exports/code doesn't seem to be the same? In the man page for exports on macOS it uses explicit flags?  My regular line in code/etc/exports/code on Linux:  precode# NFS Share to Virtualbox guests: /path/to/my/shared/directory 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check) /code/pre  Calling codenfsd checkexports/code returns the following:  precodegetaddrinfo() failed for 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check) exports:2: couldn't get address for host: 192.168.56.0/24(rw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check) exports:2: no valid hosts found for export /code/pre  And if I simplify and change the codeetc/exports/code entry to code/path/to/my/shared/directory -network 192.168.56.0 -mask 255.255.255.0/code I get the following output from codenfsd checkexports/code:  precodeexports:2: path contains non-directory or non-existent components: /path/to/my/shared/directory exports:2: no usable directories in export entry and no fallback /code/pre  emNote: code/path/to/my/shared/directory/code is obviously a just a placeholder filepath for this question, not my actual entry in code/etc/exports/code/em   Is it just because the line in code/etc/exports/code is crap, or I need some other configuration? sor do I need the macOS Server app?   From looking at https://help.apple.com/serverapp/mac/5.3/#/apd106E5632-C4E6-4572-8289-B9ACC652E88C it seems like it might not be anything I need the macOS Server app for?/s  EDIT:  What I want is the equivalent behaviour and rw permissions of coderw,fsid=root,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check/code in my exporting, I've got it working with NFS Manager where I can mount the folder on my VM guest but read-only.  <answer282658> macOS Server is not required at all to share directories over NFS. The macOS client provides all necessary tools.  Testing various exports with bogus paths, I'd assume your path simply doesn't exist.  The most convenient GUI-tool for NFS is NFS Manager. You will be presented with a nag-screen launching it or changing configurations, but it works without further restrictions.  hr  Most of your desired options are available in macOS (check codeman exports/code) and can be configured with NFS Manager:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8pxCO.png" alt="NFS Manager screenshot"  Some details have to be configured in the advanced options (e.g. the access permissions).  <answer282664> What was required was the following line in code/etc/exports/code:  precode/path/to/shared/dir -mapall=&lt;uid of local user on host machine with correct perms&gt; -network 192.168.56.0 -mask 255.255.255.0 /code/pre  codeexports(5)/code is the FreeBSD version, obviously. Once I did some googling for the solution with respect to "FreeBSD" instead of "Mac", the necessary information presented itself, the a colleague pointed out the exact flag needed.  Source: http://www.freebsdmadeeasy.com/tutorials/freebsd/using-freebsd-nfs.php  NFS Manager was helpful in validating the solution but not necessary.   <comment356179> The path most definitely does exist  <comment356180> I will check out NFS Manager though, and thanks for verifying that I don't need to buy the server app <comment356181> @BenjaminR I got said error only when I entered non-existent paths in /etc/exports (which doesn't happen with NFS Manager, because it offers a file system browser). Haven't tested it with aliases or soft links though.
