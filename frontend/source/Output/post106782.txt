How can I reset the Safari bookmarks in iCloud? Safari 7.0 <body> Do the solutions discussed in this AD question still work with Safari 7.0, or is there something new / better / easier? I have dozens of duplicate bookmarkMenu and bookmarkBar folders, maybe over 100.. These are on mobile and desktop systems. Mac and PC. Can / should I do this through iCloud.com?  If the moderators think this a duplicate question, please advise where best to post. Thanks
