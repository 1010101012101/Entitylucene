Can't acquire DHCP with WPA2 Enterprise <body> I have a user with a MacBook Pro (late 2013) running OS X 10.10.5 "Yosemite" that can't acquire a DHCP address from our corporate Wi-Fi. It's a WPA2 Enterprise network with Meraki on the back end. From the Meraki tools I can see him authenticate successfully but just won't accept an IP.   It's worth nothing that we have a dozen other Macs (iMacs, MBPs, Mac Minis) all connected without issue. iPhones, Android, and Windows 7/8 all connect to the same network without issue as well.  Outside of an answer, are there some tools I can use to troubleshoot this better?   <answer200922> I figured out the problem. I wanted to post a solution in case anybody else sees this. There was a corrupted lease in our DHCP server that this Mac kept trying to request. As a result, the two (DHCP server &amp; Mac) went into a loop until timeout.   Fixing the DHCP database the Mac acquired an address with no issues.
