Just add the option  precodetree -N /name_of_directory /code/pre  codeman tree/code reads:  precode-N     Print non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal numbers. /code/pre  Tell me if this still does not work!  Also, you seem to use codezsh/code?? I am not familiar with that. I use codebash/code, though.  <comment327616> I did not found the solution, but I found the error happens only when I sshed to Ubuntu from Mac OS X.
