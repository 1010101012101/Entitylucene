How to copy thousands photos from Mac/PC to iPhone? <body> Is there any easy and fast way to copy thousands photos from Mac/PC to iPhone?  I tried Dropbox, but I have to export every photo one by one. Also I have tried AirDrop, but my iPhone does not show in the Mac Finder.  <answer262389> You can sync them automatically by turning on iCloud Photo Library, or installing Google Photos (desktop uploader and app). Depending on the size of your library or the size of your pictures, you may have to pay for additional space on either.  You can also sync them manually to your iOS device, following this Apple Support guide:     ol   liMake sure that you have the latest version of iTunes./li   liOpen iTunes on your computer./li   liUse the included USB cable to connect your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer./li   liClick on the device icon in iTunes./li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qEyGy.jpg" alt="find device on itunes"      In the sidebar on the left side of the iTunes window, click Photos.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBpg5.jpg" alt="sidebar - photos on itunes"      ol start="5"   liClick the box next to "Sync Photos." If instead you see "iCloud Photos is On," all of your photos and videos are already on all of   your devices that use iCloud Photo Library. You don't need to sync   them through iTunes./li   liChoose the app or folder that you want to sync from. If you choose to sync a folder with sub-folders, the first level of sub-folders will   appear as albums on your device./li   /ol      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ClHEG.jpg" alt="chose sync folder for photos on itunes"      ol start="7"   liChoose to sync all photos or selected albums. /li   liSelect "Include videos" to sync the videos from your app or folder too./li   liClick Apply.  /li   /ol      You must import Slo-Mo and Time-Lapse videos through the Photos app or   Image Capture in OS X Yosemite or later for their effect to be synced   via iTunes. When you use iCloud Photo Library, Slo-Mo and Time-Lapse   videos keep their effects. Live Photos keep their effect when you   import them to Photos in OS X El Capitan and later, but they lose   their effect if you sync them back to your device via iTunes. Use   iCloud Photo Library so that Live Photos keep their effect, no matter   what device you use.   Photos that you sync using iTunes appear in a   "Synced Photos" section of the Photos app on iOS devices. If you make   changes to the photos synced in iTunes, the new versions replace the   synced photos already on the device. But anything on the device   outside of the "Synced Photos" section won't change.   Note that images manually synced to your device are not editable on it.  <comment328689> I tried Dropbox, but I have to export every photo one by one.

It does however depend on how new your Mac and iPhone are - which models do you have?
