Why cursor pointer size not getting small on Mac OS X sierra? <body> I'm using Logitech mouse with my Mac OS X sierra, the issue is when I'm changing the cursor pointer size, making it small, it's not appearing. Only big pointer can be seen not the small one. Can anyone help me about this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QQwrm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x02Gxm.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jPhCm.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer287917> Please try going to System Preferences-Accesssibility-Display:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SZ38Q.png" alt="Slide the Cursor size knob"  Slide the Cursor size knob towards Normal. Does your cursor change size while you are sliding it? If so you can make it smaller that way.  Also, is it possible you have zoomed in or out on the screen itself?  Go to System Preferences-Accessibility-Zoom:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPcAe.png" alt="enter image description here"  Try turning on Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom, and then use Zoom out to zoom all the way to the normal setting, where you cannot zoom out further.  <comment363153> Could you add more info about your issue or, perhaps, some screenshots? <comment363158> please take a look at the cursor pointer! few screenshot attached.

During moving the knob to "Normal", nearly half the slider the cursor totally disappears! Any thoughts? <comment363625> Did you try to connect some other mouse instead of your Logitech? <comment363854> Do you have betterTouchTool installed? That has options which mess with cursor size.
