Can I mark a SD Card as permanent storage? <body> I own a PNY - StorEDGE 128GB and I remember that it was initially recognized as a fixed/permanent disk like a hard disk.  I reformatted it to add encryption but now the disk is shown as a removable device. This keeps tools like SkyDrive from using it as a target.  Can I set the volume type somehow?  <answer113413> Yes! You can change the volume from a removable device to a fixed disk by emflipping the removable bit./em Lexar made an application for Windows called 'Lexar BootIt', a well known application for this task.  I found a solution involving DD, but strongemI have not tested it/em/strong and I'd severely recommend backing up your card before doing strongemanything/em/strong with DD/Terminal. I created these instructions quickly. If you aren't comfortable with Terminal, use Windows! strongemI am not responsible if your SD card is permenantly damaged in this operation. dd is exceedingly dangerous!/em/strong  Use emdiskutil list/em in a Terminal instance to list all volumes. I found my hard drive under /dev/disk1. Remember to substitute disk1 in the later commands with your own disk name.  Don't forget to unmount the disk:  precodehdiutil eject disk1 /code/pre  And now the command:  precodedd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk1 bs=1 count=1 /code/pre  Again, back up strongemEVERYTHING/em/strong before doing anything with dd!  <comment133125> I will test today and accept if working. Thanks in advance. <comment133211> dd did not work. Will experiment with the Windows Tool tomorrow. <comment147536> dd works. You need to unmount (not eject) your sdcard partition and point the dd command to the correct volume (most likely `/dev/disk1` as mentioned in the answer) <comment264303> So I tested this on a PCIe attached SSD on osx 10.10 - and it doesn't work.   :(   (and yes, I understand exactly what it's doing, and use dd probably on almost a daily basis...)
