Can you undo close all Finder windows (alt + click the red close button)? <body> I just inadvertently closed around 20 Finder windows in one click, each related to ongoing projects in them, by clicking the red window button and having "alt" key pressed.   strongIs there something I can do to reopen all the windows that have just been closed?/strong  It might be too late for me now but if I make this mistake again it will save me a lot of time to reopen these windows.  <answer275063> This functionality is not available natively in Finder, but it can be gained by the use of third party software such as XtraFinder and emperhaps/em Default Folder X. Please note though that you would have to check compatibility as you don't specify what version of macOS you're using.  Another option that emmay/em interest you is to access your emrecent folders/em. To do this:  ul liEnsure you have Finder active/li liClick on the Go menu/li liHover over the Recent Folders sub-menu/li liYou'll now see your most recently opened folders/li liSelect the folders one by one to reopen them/li /ul  strongNotes:/strong   ol liThis is not an emundo/em option, but at least you can easily reopen most of your Finder windows (although not likely as many as 20 of them)./li liI have no affiliation whatsoever with either XtraFinder or Default Folder X./li /ol  <comment345962> As far as Finder, by itself, is concerned, no, once you close them there gone.
