iMessage on El Capitan no longer works <body> I'm using the latest version of El Capitan (10.11.5) and Messages.app/iMessage has ceased to function. Messages sent to iMessage users hang after a few minutes of trying to send. I've tried the following already based on some research:  ul liSigning out/back in of the relevant account/li liResetting PRAM/li liTurning off iMessage on all devices for an hour+ to "reset"/li /ul  Nothing seems to work. I should add that my iPhone works fine. However, it might also be worth noting that prior to this, I was also affected by the issue where images would come through as "0 bytes of XXX Kb downloaded - Tap to download". I've also had tons of issues where my Mac doesn't sync messages with my phone. They either lag for a few minutes or more, or just never sync, period.  Is there any way to fix this? Apple's status site shows all green for iMessage and related services. I've also checked Console logs but there's nothing there that seems relevant.  strongUpdate:/strong switched DNS providers in Network settings to Google's 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4, signed out/signed back in of Messages and it's working again.   <comment304837> I'd say it sounds like a connectivity issue - everything else working fine? Email, web pages, YouTube, downloads etc?? Ethernet or WiFi, btw? There's a list of 'usual suspects' for messages here - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105221/messages-wont-let-me-sign-in-to-imessage/205322#205322 <comment304843> Does it happen on all networks? And is there *any* chance you have a firewall of any kind running? <comment304849> All networks, no firewall, wifi in good shape. Will check out that usual suspects list -- thanks. <comment304850> Just switched DNS providers to Google's and signed out/signed back in and voila. Synced up and works again. So weird.
