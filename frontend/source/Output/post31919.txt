How do you list items with and without labels from the terminal? <body> Is there a command that can tell the label status (labels as applied in the info menu in the finder cmd+i) of an item from the command-line in OS X? Essentially, I just want to list all the items with or without labels in the current directory, but I can't find any way to pull them appart.  This will help in creating a timed script that runs in the background. Then I can apply a label in finder and expect an action automatically apply to that file without having to make special conditions or keep a curated file with a list.  <answer31920> You can use  precodexattr -p com.apple.FinderInfo filename /code/pre  but you will need some work to process the output. See this answer on superuser for an example with a bash script and one with Python.  <answer31924> Using codels/code, you can show the extended metadata of files:  precode$ ls -l@ -rw-r--r--@ 1 andrew  staff  1292910 Aug  9 11:36 labelled_file.jpg     com.apple.metadata:kMDLabel_hlsi7t7nerhynemqvydgeb26de       50  /code/pre  However, the quickest way to get labelled and unlabelled files is with an attribute search using codemdfind/code:  precode$ mdfind -onlyin . -literal 'kMDItemFSLabel &gt; 0'  # labels have value 50 /cwd/labelled_file.jpg  $ mdfind -onlyin . -literal 'kMDItemFSLabel == 0' /cwd/all.jpg /cwd/other.jpg /cwd/files.jpg /code/pre  <comment36880> Thanks a lot, I ended up using this for my solution :) <comment36881> Your reference was very helpful, thanks! <comment36894> @dat5h if you find an answer useful please give an up vote and choose one of the answers as 'accepted' <comment37078> Thanks for reminding me to mark-as-accepted, I had forgotten.
