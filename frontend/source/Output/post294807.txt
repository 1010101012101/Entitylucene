How to retrieve photos from a disabled iPhone 4 <body> My girl has an old iPhone 4 with iOS probably below v. 5 reckoned from Apple symbol. It was broken; now it is fixed, but I noticed that it is disabled, the screen reads "iPhone is disabled - connect to iTunes". When I connect it to iTunes, a message box says something like "iThone is password locked".  Now I know that I could simple restore the iPhone and have it working again, but the trouble is that this iPhone contains pictures of our friend who died a long time ago and these pictures are the only memories we have of him.  I need your expertise to retrive these pictures if possible.  Thank you.
