Parrallels 10 and Windows 10 keyboard typing incorrect characters <body> When I type a double quotes on Parallels 10 with Windows 10 I see the following character.  Does anybody have any idea how to fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O8S8c.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer199126> Somehow Windows 10 set my language input to "English - United Kingdom" instead of "English - United States".  By removing everything besides "English - United States" under "Languages" in Control Panel it fixed the issue.
