No audio on Mac Pro after Yosemite upgrade <body> I have looked at other people's problems regarding this issue but the way they solved it cannot fix my problem as I don't have any options to change anything. see images. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/beOu6.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPYB6.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/caPpK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer163162> I had the same problem after upgrading to Yosemite and I've been looking for an answer on StackOverflow ever since. I found an answer which was not upvoted so it was harder to find unfortunately, but here is a way which solved my problem:  Open your terminal on your Mac and type in:  codesudo killall coreaudiod/code  Press enter and you're done. It should work now.  Hope this helps.  <comment186769> What have you tried to troubleshoot these problems? You mention having tried other people's solutions, but you don't indicate what they were.
