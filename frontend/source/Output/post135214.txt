Why does my iPad always get an error when trying to send a message? <body> Whenever I want to send an iMessage on my iPad, an error shows up saying "Message Failure- message not sent".  The odd part is that the message is sent.  The receiver receives the message without a problem.  Only my iPad shows that an error occurred (which it didn't).  <comment160261> What is your e-mail adress provider ? <comment160304> @Trev√∂rAnneDenise e-mail provider wouldn't matter since this is related to iMessage.  OP - is this for every single iMessage you send? <comment160344> @KrisReynolds oops yes that's true sorry ! I had missed it !
