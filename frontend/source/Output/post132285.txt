Disk not readable message when using <body> If I try to use either of the two usb ports on my macbook pro, I get the following message "The disk you inserted was not readable by this computer." and I don't have a disk inserted anywhere... I have the option to eject or ignore the message, and either option does not solve the problem. Can't use the usb ports without getting this message.  <answer132289> From your question it is not clear what you put into those USB ports. Memory sticks appear to the system as a disk, so the message you quoted might be caused by a memory stick that had been formatted in a file system your Mac does not know (possibly from a Linux computer?).P If you want to widen your possibilities, you might consider installing OSXFUSE. But I would appreciate if you first clarify what you mean by "use either of the two usb ports".  <comment155554> Does this persist through a restart? If so, if you open Disk Utility, are there any unexpected entries in the volume list on the left?
