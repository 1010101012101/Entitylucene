High CPU usage by a process called PTPCamera <body> On my Macbook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) is a process, called codePTPCamera/code, using a lot of CPU-Time . I already have killed this process but it spawned immediately again.   85% of CPU usage eats my Battery so I would be happy if anyone could help &#128522;   I found out that the process is a "Picture Transfer Process for a Camera" in Short codePTPCamera/code it will be launched by iPhoto.app and also with the newer Photo.app. emBut/em still does not explain the high CPU usage without a Phone connected.   So what is this process for and how can I control its behaviour? Anyone else has this problem and how did you solve this?  <answer200353> I would just force quit the process, and if that doesn't work, I'd make a command line script to constantly send the "kill" command.  <answer200554> So we found the Solution:   ol liConnect your iPhone/Camera and reopen codePhotos.app/code or codeiPhoto/code/li liClose codeiPhoto/code or codePhotos.app/code/li liDisconnect your iPhone/Camera/li liOpen codePhotos/iPhoto/code again/li /ol  now the PTPCamera Process should be terminated gracefully and won't spawn again in a busy waiting loop.   You strongdo not/strong have to do this steps all the time, only necessary to terminate the process graceful and kick it out of the busy waiting state. How to come in this state, we (AppleDev and I) do not know.  <answer200745> I've just noticed the same issue with the public beta of El Capitan build 15A243d when connecting an iPad 3 to charge and have reported it to Apple.  In my case I had neither iTunes or Photos open and also selected the iPad to "Not Trust" the computer as I want only wanting to charge the iPad. So this appears to be a bug. Hopefully this will be fixed in a later build.  Force quitting the process for now.  <answer257677> When it happened to me and I opened iPhoto, I found it iPhoto tried to show the pictures in my iPad, but failed to do so. So it seems to be related to a temporary failure of retrieving the photos  I closed iPhoto, unlocked iPad, unplugged and replugged in the iPad, and everything was fine (PTPCamera peacefully stayed at 0% CPU usage). I doubt it was related to the iPad unlock, but am not completely sure. It could be fixed by the replugging.  <comment241428> This process is needed for iPhoto, however. <comment241462> Well this does not solve the problem - only the symptom. <comment241963> Welcome to Ask Different!

Seems like a sledgehammer for when a flyswatter is required <comment242055> @bmike happened on my 10.10.4 (14E46) Productive Machine with iOS9 Public Beta, did not happened (yet) on 10.11 ElCap. <comment242056> How much CPU does it consume on your machine - does it spawn immediately again? <comment301543> Worked for me on 10.7 Lion as well.
