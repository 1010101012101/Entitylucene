How can I repeat a Playlist? <body> I have an iPhone 5, iOS 8.4.1. How can I repeat a Playlist? I've found how to repeat a song, but I want to repeat a playlist.  <answer201844> Select your playlist.br Tap on or drag the mini player up to display the full player.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDuKw.jpg" alt="mini player"  Then tap the repeat icon.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHXcp.jpg" alt="full player, repeat activated"  If tapped twice, it will repeat the song currently played only (a tiny "1" appears on the top right side of the icon).  <comment242765> Smoosher already answered this question here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/195071/repeat-on-ios-8-4-music-app <comment243485> Please do not answer your own question by editing it; you can add an answer if you wish, clicking on the button below the existing ones.
