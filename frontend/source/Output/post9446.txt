Does the iPad 2 Support the iPad 1 Dock? <body> I'm thinking about selling my first generation iPad, but was wondering if I should sell the dock with it. I know that they are coming out with a new iPad dock specifically for the second generation. Will it not fit on the first generation dock?  <answer9449> Hard to say for sure if the original iPad Dock will work with the iPad 2. Apple is selling an iPad 2 Dock, however, that is different than the original model.  <answer9483> I would recommend waiting to sell the dock.  I would venture a guess that it will, however, not perfectly. eg, I use my iphone edge dock with my iphone 4 and I think it is great!  <answer11241> It's possible to use the first generation dock, but it's a bit difficult to get the iPad 2 connected, because of the tapered edge: See this link.  <comment9938> I fear you might have to wait until later next week until someone can actually try this :-)
