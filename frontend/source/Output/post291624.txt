Lookup the dictionary with wildcards <body> Since wildcards aren't recognized by the GUI, is there another way?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zhOEE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer292731> Use codeegrep/code command in codeTerminal/code. It recognizes wildcards:  precodeegrep "^..arl$" /usr/share/dict/words /code/pre  The caret code^/code tells codeegrep/code command to search for the string at the beginning of a line, and the dot code./code matches any character except a new line.  So, here are the results of a search:  precodegnarl pearl quarl snarl wharl /code/pre  By using a question mark code?/code you can even find words that may or may not have a characters:  precodeegrep "^int..?$" /usr/share/dict/words /code/pre  Result (here's codeinto/code included):  precodeinter intil into intue /code/pre  Also you can use this codebash alias/code:  precodefindword () { /usr/bin/grep ^"$@"$ /usr/share/dict/words ; }  findword '.ello' /code/pre  Result:  precodecello hello /code/pre  Or you can search using code*/code for all words ending in codemill/code (including the word codemill/code itself):  precodeegrep '^.*mill$' /usr/share/dict/words  crabmill crazingmill graymill gristmill mill overmill pugmill remill sawmill semimill treadmill walkmill windmill /code/pre  <answer292738> From the command line you can use codelook/code which looks for the string as a prefix of a word in the file- code/usr/share/dict/words/code.  precodelook ent /code/pre  Right click the word in the Terminal window and select Look Up "....." menu or you can codegrep/code code/usr/share/dict/words/code using regular expressions or extended regular expressions. Such as:  precodegrep 'hello$' /usr/share/dict/words /code/pre  <answer292748> I never liked that the strongDictionary.app/strong in strongmacOS/strong does not support emwildcards/em and while I mentioned in my comment to the OP to use and online dictionary that supports emwildcards/em, I also searched strongGoogle/strong for a emthird-party app/em that could be installed and didn't find any.  While one can easily embookmark/em the https://www.onelook.com strongURL/strong, nonetheless, I decided to appify it, using strongAppleScript/strong, saving it as strongWildcard Dictionary Search.app/strong, so I could access it from the strongDock/strong or strongSpotlight/strong, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hsS0I.png" alt="Wildcard Dictionary Search"  Copy and paste the strongAppleScript/strong emcode/em below into a new blank strongScript Editor/strong emdocument/em and save it as an application.   precodeon run     try         tell current application             activate             set theSearchString to text returned of ¬                 (display dialog ¬                     "Wildcard Dictionary Search:" default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} ¬                     default button 2 with title "https://www.onelook.com/?w=")         end tell         tell application "Safari"             tell front window                 if theSearchString is not equal to "" then                     set current tab to (make new tab with properties ¬                         {URL:"https://www.onelook.com/?w=" &amp; theSearchString})                 else                     set current tab to (make new tab with properties ¬                         {URL:"https://www.onelook.com"})                 end if             end tell         end tell     on error eStr number eNum         if eNum is not equal to -128 then             display dialog eStr &amp; " number " &amp; eNum buttons {"OK"} ¬                 default button 1 with icon caution             return         end if     end try end run /code/pre  hr  Note that you can give it a custom icon and there are instructions on the Internet how to do that. I took the strongDictionary.icns/strong file from within the strongDictionary.app,/strong which is emred/em, and using strongPreview/strong to exported the 1024x1024 image as a strongPNG/strong. I changed it to emblue/em in strongGIMP/strong by adjusting the Hue-Saturation on the emred/em color. Then using instructions in Create Your Own Custom Icons in OS X 10.7.5 or Later I created a emblue/em strongDictionary.icns/strong file, which I used to replace the strongapplet.icns/strong file within the strongAppleScript/strong app, renaming it strongapplet.icns/strong.  <comment368187> Use an online dictionary that supports wildcards: [https://www.onelook.com](https://www.onelook.com) <comment370828> I should have added: I need to do this offline. <comment370830> Not sure why this answer got down votes. <comment370831> My fault for not mentioning I need offline. <comment370832> I think the same. I sure it's right answer))
