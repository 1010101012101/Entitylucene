Language spelling menu switch <body> I understand that Mac OsX should recognise the language automatically - and to say the honest truth - it does but... on rare occasions I need to see which language in"ON" and what are the choices...  Menu indicator-switch would be of great help - maybe an extra function to the keyboard indicator would solve the problem.  I use 4 languages in many programs...   <answer248608> You should be able to see your selected lanugate in your menu bar if you have the option turned on.  In System Preferences  Keyboard, make sure you have the option "Show Input Menu in Menu Bar" checked  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofOxJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Your Menu Bar should now show a flag with the corresponding language  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yFOnP.png" alt="enter image description here"  When you click on it, you should get a selection of the input sources you currently have available.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qy7Jn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer248645> One way to maximize the ease of changing the spellcheck language is to use an app which allows you to synchronize the keyboard layout and the spellcheck dictionary.  I think both Nisus Writer and Mellel have this feature.  <comment308027> The choices used by the "automatic" setting in system prefs/keyboard/text/spelling are normally determined by the boxes you check in the Setup item of that menu. <comment308028> Perhaps best not to use "automatic" and just switch among you four specific languages via Edit  Spelling and Grammar  Show Spelling and Grammar in each app. <comment308077> The question has nothing to do with input sources, but concerns the spellcheck language, which is determined elsewhere.  You should delete this. <comment308085> @TomGewecke   How did you determine that since it's no where in the OP's question? <comment308120> Because the word "spelling" is in the subject line and automatic language recognition really can only refer to spellcheck.
