Security Settings Don't Stick <body> I've been trying to change my security settings to let apps downloaded from anywhere open. Or to at least open the app I want. Neither seem to be working.   I don't get the verification to open the app when I click "Open Anyway" and every time I set it to open from anywhere, it reverts back to the original setting.   How do I fix either of these issues?  <comment291075> that's a bad idea, by the way. signature checking is important for security. you can still open individual apps which are known to be good by alt+right click â€” open.
