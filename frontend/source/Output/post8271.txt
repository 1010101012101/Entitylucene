iTunes keeps respawning <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Why does iTunes re-open after I quit?       Hey,  I have some rather annyoing behavior with my system: Whenever I close or codekill -9/codeiTunes it just keeps coming back up.  Any ideas how I can find strongthe root cause/strong of this?  <answer8279> Do you use any add-ons / controllers for iTunes, like Media Servers (eg. Plex, Front Row) or others for global hot-keys or song notifications? Sometimes these apps use applescript, which tends to launch applications if theyÂ´re not already running.  <comment8946> Actually I do. I use Last.fm and the scrobbler starts with iTunes. I'll try deinstalling that.
