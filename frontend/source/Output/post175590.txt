OS X Mail - How can I setup multiple e-mail addresses under the same mail account? <body> OS X Mail - How can I setup multiple e-mail addresses under the same mail account?  I use two addresses with the same account one is me@myworkdomain.com and the other is me@mypersonaldomain.com. On iOS I can add the second address to the mail account configuration and I can send from both.  How is this done on OS X's Apple Mail?  <answer175604> To add another email address to an account you add it to the email field.   Each address is separated by a comma.  ","   But note just because you can add it does not mean you email provider will accept an address from a different provider/domain.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RtlB2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Edit: As of macOS Sierra, the procedure is slightly different. The "Email Address" field is now a dropdown, and you add additional addresses by selecting "Edit Email Addresses..." from this dropdown.  <comment207146> Perfect, thanks! <comment364150> This no longer works under Sierra. Has anyone found a way to accomplish the same thing using Mac Mail under Sierra? <comment364172> @elipsett In Sierra, you add additional email aliases by going to the same dialog, then selecting "Edit Email Addresses" from what is now the Email Address dropdown.
