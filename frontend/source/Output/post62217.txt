There is no connected camera message with built in FaceTime camera <body> Anyone run into "There is no connected camera" message while using any of the camera applications (Messages, PhotoBooth, Skype, etc.)? I tried force quitting all the applications that use the camera but with no luck. Even tried codesudo killall VDCAssistant/code without any luck. Restarting the machine fixes the issue, but it is highly annoying to do so every day. I am running 10.8.1 on 2012 MacBook Pro.  <answer62240> If the issue is not Application-specific, nor User-specific, and your computer clearly recognizes the iSight, you should try reseting the strongSMC/strong.  To do so, just:  ol liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter to a power source, connecting it to the Mac if its not already connected./li liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) kbdShift/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdOption/kbd and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li /ol  <answer148265> From osxdaily:  ul liQuit all open apps that may try to use the FaceTime camera/li liOpen Terminal, found in the /Applications/Utilities directory in OS X/li liEnter the following command string exactly, then hit return:  precodesudo killall VDCAssistant /code/pre/li liEnter the administrator password when requested, this is required to execute a command with superuser privileges as prefixed by sudo/li liRelaunch the app that was attempting to use the camera/li /ul  Or...
