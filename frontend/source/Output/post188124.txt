always Allow control clicking on yosemite? <body> I've recently started playing Minecraft that uses codecontrol/code and click as the main game controls. On Macintosh, I can't seem to use them both at the same time, it takes me to mission control. Is there a system preference to allow this?  P.S. I'm using a standard mouse, not magic.  <comment222568> What game are you playing? What are you trying to do in the game that isn't working? It's hard to help you without more details. <comment222569> it's minecraft, you run using ctrl and you punch using click. if you hold down ctrl you can't click which makes you have to stop running to punch (something that's not a problem on windows) <comment222575> Have you tried Cmd instead of Ctrl? Some multi-platform games swap them over for Mac.
