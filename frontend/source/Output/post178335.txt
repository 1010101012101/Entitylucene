Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root <body> When I plug in my usb memory card reader nothing happens. It was working ten minutes ago when I used the xbian installer to put it on the sd card, but now nada.  Something briefly flashes up then disappears in Disk Utility.  I see this in the system.log  precodeMar 26 17:22:52 Johns-iMac kernel[0]: USBMSC Identifier (non-unique): 000000009744 0x5e3 0x716 0x9744, 2 Mar 26 17:22:53 Johns-iMac.local com.apple.kextd[19]: Can't create kext cache under / - owner not root.

Came down to not using the usb multi card reader thingy.  <comment211209> The root folder should be owned by the system (root). Probably some subsequent folders are also owned by you instead of root. Boot to Recovery HD and fix it with Disk Utility. Please add the SD-card brand/model. <comment211211> @klanomath Thanks for your interest.  I think maybe it's actually complaining about who owns the root directly of the mounted drive.  Have discovered other SD drives are fine.  I don't think the card is borked (at least not yet) but rather the filesystem on it is.  So if I can work out some way to mount it without it trying to mount it...?! <comment211213> samsung 32gb and some microscopic writing that does not indicate the model <comment211220> Please leave a comment when downvoting so that I understand what it is about my question that requires improvement. <comment211221> @JohnMee I didn't downvote your question! Instead I starred it. AFAIR I never downvoted a question I commented somehow constructivly.
