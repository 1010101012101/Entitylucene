Flash player will not install corectly <body> I am trying to install flash player on my MacBook Air.  I have been using flash player  without any problems.  Recently when I tried to use a program that uses flash a popup appears that says the plug in failed to load.  I tried to reinstall shockwave flash and it said that it installed but the problem persisted.    <answer120971> Google Chrome does not use the system flash, it has it's own copy of Flash. Try deleting and reinstalling the Google Chrome app.
