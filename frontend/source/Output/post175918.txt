How long does Safari's cache last? <body> I would like to know Safari's cache lifetime. In case it has limited duration, also how to extend it.  <answer176008> The Safari cache lasts for as long as the max-age header (see section 14.9) is set (by the server which is serving the file) for the specific file that is being cached, unless it is cleared manually. However, codemax-age=0/code caches the file until the file is modified (or the server tells the client the file is modified).  <comment208013> If understood well, it depends on the server, not the browser? <comment208030> @Biotechnologist Yes
