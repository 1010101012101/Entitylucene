ICloud ID associated to an expired email address <body> So I have an iPad which has recently being updated to iOS 10 and now it keeps showing those messages saying to log in with my iCloud account.  Once entered the password it says that the account is blocked and to check the email for instructions, but for some reasons the id of that account is associated with an email that no longer exists, so I checked online and found this apple solution, which obviously doesn't work, because      Change your Apple ID to the email address that iCloud is asking you to sign in with.   sends a confirmation email to an address not existing.   So basically I'm stuck in a circle in which I have to change that ID, but in order to to that I need a security/verify code that is sent to the old email (that doesn't exists anymore).  So I thought of just logging out of iCloud, but no I need to login to do that, because the account is blocked/locked (probabily due to the expired email I guess).  My ITunes account is working, I can log in on appleid.apple.com and change secret questions ecc.. but as I said I cannot change the email as the guide suggests.  Any suggestions ?
