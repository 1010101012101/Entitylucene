Can I wake up iPhone by double tapping the screen? <body> Can I wake up an iPhone/iPad by double tapping the screen without hacking/installing Cydia?  <answer239894> You can't do this natively as part of the built-in functions of iOS.  There are a few apps that allows knocking, one is called strongMacID/strong.  I've used it for a few years and the developer is very responsive to support issues.  <comment294605> I think there was an app that use the hardware to recognize a "knock", but i don't now the name of it. It's not possible to enable this in settings. <comment294648> You could suggest it to Apple and maybe they'll make it an option for a future version of iOS. <comment357360> Isn't OP asking for waking up the iphone or ipad rather than unlocking a macOS device?
