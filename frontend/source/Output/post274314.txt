Schedule open automator application every days works only one time <body> I'm using macOS Sierra and I have a strange problem: I'm trying to schedule Automator &amp; a Calendar event to open up a file every day when a recurring calendar event occurs. But the Automator workflow only runs the first day!  strongHere's how I made it/strong: I created the event in the Calendar app on the calendar "Automator" (local on my Mac). I made a recurring event in the calendar that shows up daily at 7 AM. Then, I created an automator workflow to open this file (which is an automator file that opens a URL in Safari) every time the event goes off, but it only runs &amp; opens up the file the first time the recurring event occurs in the Calendar, not the rest of the times.  strongHow can I get the Automator workflow to run each time this calendar event recurs instead of just the first time?/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3e4F.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment344913> Just make a recurring event with your Calendar app! <comment344962> Of course I made a recurring event all days, I forgot write it! <comment345001> Your question really confuses me. What are you trying to do exactly? <comment345022> It's very simple, I want to schedule to open a file every day. I've created an event with an alarm for open the file, and it works perfectly, but only the first day. The other events inside the calendar with the same alarm won't open the file... <comment345026> That was totally unclear from your question, so I've edited it now. Do you mind describing your Automator workflow in detail so we can help you diagnose the issue? Screenshots or a detailed description of the Automator workflow in the question would help, then comment back once you've done that. <comment345062> I simply create an application file with automator for open a url and show the result in safari. It works every time I double click on the file I've created. Then, I've created an event inside a calendar on my mac, and the event have to open the file every day at 7:00 am. It works only the first time, the other days anything happens
