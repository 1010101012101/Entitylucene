In fact, if you are not planning to use it, I would recommend shutting down all the services from codeServer Admin/code  <answer218851> There are actually strongtwo/strong things you could do.   strongOption 1/strong You can edit your host file and so localhost won't be used by OS X server anymore. How to edit your host file is explained in this link.  strongOption 2/strong I prefer this option, which is available in emMAMP PRO/em. I'm not sure if it is available in the free version of emMAMP/em.  When you open MAMP, click on the host tab. You will now see this screen: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fawaq.jpg" alt="Screenshot of MAMP PRO - Hosts" You can than change the server name and start/restart you services to apply the changes. In the screenshot above, I can access my website      http://localhost/    and   http://website/   I hope this will solve your problem.  <comment264592> Did you try to turn of the website(*) in the OS X Server app? *I'm not sure if website is the correct name <comment264593> turn on or off? <comment264596> Off. Can't change my first comment <comment264597> But everything is turned off in OS X Server. <comment264598> Everything is turned off... what else can I do? <comment264599> Oh, then check for if any services are still on under `System Preferences`-`Sharing` and disable them. <comment264600> Yes, it helped:) there was turned on Remote Login.
