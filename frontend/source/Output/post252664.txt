Problems executing an osascript command via cron <body> I have a little shell script which creates a new reminder for a project. This works pretty fine and I can execute in the command line codenewCfSamples "my new sample"/code and the reminder gets created.  I now have a little R script, which figures out what samples are new and it should create a reminder for this. This script works fine as well and creates the Reminders.  Both together, so cron is starting my R script fails at the point when it is executing my little codenewCfSamples/code script with the following error message: codeexecution error: Reminders got an error: An error of type -1743 has occurred. (-1743)/code.  I then started my script directly with codecron/code and this also fails. Here is the complete error message.  precodeSubject: Cron &lt;madejung@madejung-2&gt; /Users/madejung/bin/newCfSamples test X-Cron-Env: &lt;SHELL=/bin/sh&gt; X-Cron-Env: &lt;PATH=/usr/bin:/bin&gt; X-Cron-Env: &lt;LOGNAME=madejung&gt; X-Cron-Env: &lt;USER=madejung&gt; X-Cron-Env: &lt;HOME=/Users/madejung&gt; Date: Wed, 14 Sep 2016 15:42:00 +0200 (CEST)  290:540: execution error: Reminders got an error: An error of type -1743 has occurred.

As I mentioned in the above comments, I am using the GUI LaunchControl, I started the job once by hand with the menu Job - Start and I got a little popup if R is allowed to access Reminders. I clicked yes and now it is working.  It looks like, this popup couldn't be displayed so I could never allow it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hOfZJ.png" alt="This is how the LaunchControl entry looks like"  <comment314406> Since I don't do `R`, I can't really reproduce your environment to test however I did run the _script_ you posted, changing the `list` _item_ to an appropriate target, and it ran fine from Terminal and using `launchd` with the _script_ set as a Launch Agent. (I don't use `cron` anymore as it's depreciated in OS X.) This is with the system logged in and not locked. BTW, What's will all the totally unnecessary white-space in your script? I'm talking about all the trailing space after 10 of the 13 lines of code as shown in [this image](http://imgur.com/7nFSLMD). <comment314563> Actually, I just started using the `osascript` and copy and pasted the lines from a online source. I got some strange error messages like `567:570: syntax error: Expected end of line, etc. but found command name. (-2741)` so I thought the white space is correct :-) @user3439894 could you maybe provide your solution? I also tested it with `launchd` and the GUI `LaunchControl` but this also doesn't create the ToDo entries. Thanks in advance. <comment314566> @user3439894 maybe one more thing, when I executed my shell script, there was always a popup message asking for allowance to change `Reminders`. Also when I start using this within my R script. Maybe this is missing in the `Launchd` way? But it didn't asked me? <comment314779> Is there a way to always allow R to access Reminders? Today I got asked again. I am wondering if I will overlook this again?
