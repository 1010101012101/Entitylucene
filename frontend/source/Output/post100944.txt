wacked a directory from the command line <body> I was copying a file to /usr/local/bin from the commandline on a Snow Leopard Server 10.6 ... anyhow i typed the following ...  precodesudo cp ./le /usr/local/bin /code/pre  Ouch ... that missed last forward slash from a bash shell screwed me. It wacked my directory with a copy of the le file renamed as bin. This is a pretty vanilla machine just used a fileshare. Any thoughts on how to recover? Noticed there is no lost+found ... err, at least I didn't see it in root directory.  <answer100945> Unfortunately there is no way to recover from that, aside from restoring from a backup. Command line utilities don't have an undo command (and they don't typically delete to the Trash).  lost+found wouldn't help either, since that is only used when a filesystem recovery utility has found filesystem corruption.  <answer100949> What Brian said, you are in no return land.  To avoid such problems in the future add this line to your code.bashrc/code:  precodealias sudo='sudo ' /code/pre  (and restart bash)   this way codecp/code, codemv/code, coderm/code and suchlike will ask you before they overwrite or delete something.  That has saved my bacon a few times.  <comment118885> Actually this should just copy `le` into `/usr/local/bin`, not overwrite it. Are you sure that you lost your bin directory that way?
