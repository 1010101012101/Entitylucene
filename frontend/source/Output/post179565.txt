How do I get to my Keynote 6.5 themes folder? <body> I've created a theme using codeFile &gt; Save Theme/code and would now like to share it with others. Where in the world is it though? It's visible in the codeFile &gt; Change Theme/code area but I can't find the source folder.   Googling gives me reference to code/Library/Application Support/Keynote/Themes/code or code~/Library/Application Support/iWork/Keynote/Themes//code, both of which aren't right for Keynote 6.5.  <answer179566> I found the lack of answers on Google surprising, so I had to stumble around until I found it.   Themes are located in:  code/Users/username/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Library/Application Support/User Templates//code  If you're not as familiar with the command line, you can open up Terminal and simply run this to get all your themes copied to your Desktop:   precodecp /Users/$USER/Library/Containers/com.apple.iWork.Keynote/Data/Library/Application\ Support/User\ Templates/* ~/Desktop /code/pre  Which says "copy all contents of the current users's Theme folder to that user's desktop."  <answer273933> 2-2-17 This still works in El Capitan (10.11.6) with Keynote 6.6.1 Thanks! I've been looking for this for hours!
