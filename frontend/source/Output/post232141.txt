How do I use automatic spelling check in OSX with additional spelling dictionary? <body> I often write documents in languages that are not preinstalled in OSX (vietnamese in this case). I have copied the .dic and .aff files downloaded from https://github.com/titoBouzout/Dictionaries to codeLibrary/Spelling/code folder  and things are working great if I set the spelling language explicitly to vietnamese. As I also write in English, this option is not ideal.  But if I set spell check to "automatic by language", the spelling check fails as it can't understand the text is not in English.  Does anyone know how to enable "automatic by language" for languages that are not preinstalled in OSX?  Thanks,  Son.
