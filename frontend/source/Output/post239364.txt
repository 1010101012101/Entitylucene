Rails reporting error: Failed to build gem native extension <body> I have installed up-to-date command line tools, and followed steps on other threads with this subject. I know this seems like a duplicate, but I don't see any answers to my issue here:  precodeJacobs-MacBook-Pro:~ jacob$ sudo gem install rails Building native extensions.  This could take a while...

Its working on El Capitan, ruby 1.9.3, rails 3.2, mysql 5.7  <comment293758> That worked. When I went to install homebrew after, I got a message in terminal saying I hadn't agreed to the license terms in Xcode. I have had it for a while, but I've not opened it on this computer. I opened it, and agreed to the terms/conditions, then everything after that went smoothly with rails. I'm not sure if that is relevant information to anyone else reading this post, but it was a part of the problem with this process. <comment293760> Also, I got this message after running the "CC=gcc...": "No binary rubies available for: osx/10.11/x86_64/ruby-2.0.0.p648. Continuing with compilation. Please read 'rvm help mount' to get more information on binary rubies." Is that going to be a problem, or do I need to do something about that as well? <comment293769> I don't think if that is going to be a problem for you. If it is let us know but "Agreeing to license terms in Xcode" was indeed a big thing. <comment293770> Kindly, tick the answer if it worked for you. <comment293777> I agreed to the terms, installed homebrew, and then I was able to install ruby without any further errors. Mission accomplished.
