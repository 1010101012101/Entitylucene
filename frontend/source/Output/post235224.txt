complete (full) rootless disable <body> even though El Capitan, in recovery partition, allows the user to "disable" rootless, it should be possible to disable "even more" the SIP layer.  could someone confirm that using  precodenvram csr-active-config=%ff%00%00%00 /code/pre  would disable any feature for the SIP layer?  <comment287696> What are you expecting past `csrutil disable` when booted to Recovery HD? The nvram can be cleared in many cases, so wouldn't anything set there be worse off / more temporary? <comment287698> I just want to investigate in undocumented SIP status
