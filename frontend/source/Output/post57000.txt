Remap caps lock key on iPad keyboard <body> I have a Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for my 3rd gen iPad, which is a Bluetooth keyboard. Is there any way to remap the caps lock key so it acts as the control key instead?  <answer57003> Just by using the default software, there is not a way to do this.  Theoretically, someone could write an app for jailbroken iPads to do this, but I did some searching and couldn't find anything.
