Music ratings on iOS 10 <body> I used to be able to change the rating of a music track on my phone, and they would get downloaded to iTunes when I synched my phone to my MacBook.  They seemed to have changed this in the new iOS, and there's only the heart button, but nothing else.  How I set the rating stars 0 to 5 with the iOS 10 update?  <answer252680> Apple removed the ability to rate songs with stars in iOS 10.  You can now only use Like (heart) or dislike (no heart).    You can, however, use Siri to rate a song strongwhile it's playing/strong.  You can tell Siri to rate a song from 0 to 5 stars.  Of course, that pauses the song playback to it's not an ideal solution.  <answer253028> So, this is a huge issue for me, however, i found a way around it (for a price). Download Cesium out of the app store and it restores the old look and feel of the music app without the Apple "bloat". It looks JUST like the old one, so there shouldn't be anything new or surprising with it. Just a simple replacement. I think it's like $1.99. Good luck!  <answer253380> I had the same problem.  I have bought (very cheap) and installed "Music Rating Widget", from the AppStore, which allows you to rate from the notification center while playing.  <answer253384> h2Update (for iOS 10.3+)/h2  Since iOS 10.3 star ratings can be enabled as follows:  Settings  Music  strongShow Star Ratings/strong (enable)  -  Important: emApple Music/em songs can not be rated with stars.

Subject:     Music.app: display/set song rating with stars is missing   Feedback Type:     Bug Report   Comments:     Dear iOS team,      please bring back the Music.app feature to see and set star ratings for songs.      Since installing iOS 10 I cannot see or set my song ratings for my music with stars (0-5 stars). I used this feature very often until now.      With Siri I can only emset/em a rating, but I'm not able to see it. However, this does not work when I'm offline.      Is there another way to see/set a song's star rating in iOS 10?      Thank you   <answer254386> I found an acceptable method for rating songs with iOS 10 :  The app "Music Rating Widget" let's you rate songs either from app interface and the notification center. The rating is fluid and even easier than in iOS 9. The only inconvenient is that there is no seeking bar to advance through the song (useful for batch rating).  Of course the ratings are written into the songs and are found in iTunes when the phone is synched.  The app is paid but as it's only 0,99 euros, it's very affordable.  This method i's for now satisfactory, but I guess there will more and more apps in the near future. I also asked the developer to improve the app by adding the seeking bar.  Hope this will be fixed.  <answer259577> The ability to rate songs has been added to iOS 10.2.  Another great option, and I'm quite critical of missing UI features like this, is to use a widget (previously mentioned but not linked) called Music Rating Widget. You can view the currently playing song's rating, change it, skip to the next song, and pause from the widget window.  Also, Cesium Music Player is a complete Music app replacement that does both song ratings within the app and includes a widget for rating as well. I'm particularly fond of this one because it has many other features that the default Music app is missing. (horizontal/landscape mode, view song meta data like year released, in addition to being able to easily view and set song ratings)  <answer265969> The rating option has returned to iOS 10.2, but the other answer that explains this doesn't describe how to get to it:  ol liGo to iOS Settings  Music  Turn on "Show Star Ratings"/li liGo to the Music app, play a song you wish to rate/li liTap the light grey playing song bar at the bottom of the app (with the pause and FF symbol)/li liTap the ellipsis at the bottom right/li liTap "Rate Song"/li liRate it/li /ol  <comment314807> You can still rate with stars on iTunes, on the **Songs** view. I went there and "loved" all my five star rated songs before Apple finally removes the feature altogether. <comment314830> well, an mp3 has a tag for rating, but if you rate it in iTunes, it doesn't get written to the file - only stays within the iTunes library.  You can use other software to take from an iTunes smart list, and write the tag to the actual file. <comment314881> This doesn't answer the question which is how to do music ratings in iOS 10. <comment315843> Does the rating get written back to iTunes? <comment316720> Welcome to Ask Different.  Thanks for taking the time to post an answer.  To make it even better, it's helpful if you provide a link to the app you referenced. <comment317676> I wouldn't bother asking a question in the feedback form as they don't respond to them. <comment318657> @tubedogg Apple probably gets thousands of requests/reports every day. Answering and potentially asking more questions isn't practical. I guess we have to trust Apple here that they do in fact read it all. If on the other hand nobody provides feedback then nothing gets through from a user voice. It's good that oa- gave us a sample text to quickly submit a feedback. <comment318658> @AlexIxeras I was specifically referring to the question in the "Comments" that says "Is there another way to see/set a song's star rating in iOS 10?" That's what I would have left out. <comment318661> @tubedogg Got it. Sorry, I misread your comment. <comment324786> Welcome to Ask Different. Be sure to self-disclose if you work for / develop a solution you recommend here. If not - no worries. <comment324828> I didn't develop it, I discovered it while researching Song Ratings and changes in iOS 10.2 today. <comment324836> All good. Sorry for the confusion.
