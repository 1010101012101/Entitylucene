How do I rotate a movie on the iPad/iPhone? <body> I have a movie in my camera roll that is incorrectly rotated.  I would like to rotate it 90 degrees to fix the problem.  Using this tip I was able to rotate the movie using iMovie.  However, the problem is that the movie is now cropped incorrectly.  The movie is stuck in a landscape orientation instead of a portrait orientation, so that the bottom part of the movie is now cut off.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCP00.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How can I rotate a movie in iOS while preserving its proper aspect ratio and dimensions?  <answer115553> I don't have any experience with this app but it seems like it will do what you are after: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/video-rotate-free/id626614962?mt=8  <answer115580> strongOn OS X/strong After rotating your movie in iMovie, click the crop button strong(in adjustments)/strong in the upper left. You should have a green dragable box inwhich you can resize.   Crop button may be in different place per device.   strongOn iOS/strong Tap the clip you want to crop. When a magnifying glass appears tap on it. From there you should be able to pinch with two fingers to adjust the frame of the video. This is per latest iMovie update.  <answer128899> Following up on @FlippinFun's answer, since I don't have a high enough score to comment.  strongOn iOS, using iMovie:/strong Import the clip into a new project, THEN tap the clip you want to crop. A magnifying glass will appear on top of it. You can just put two fingers on the clip, and rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise.  This works in iMovie for iOS 2.0 (791), and likely earlier versions of iMovie 2.0 for iOS 7.  You can find a detailed description of this in the "detailed help" within the iMovie app.  <comment135317> I see no crop button or adjustments button in the upper left in iMovie on my iPad using iOS 7.  See screenshot.  Where is it? <comment135587> Sorry for late response. On iOS, tap the clip you want to crop. When a magnifying glass appears tap on it. From there you should be able to pinch with two fingers to adjust the frame of the video. This is per latest iMovie update. <comment135780> Nope, doesn't work.  I'm able to do as you suggest, but what I end up with is still a landscape-oriented video with my portrait-mode lion in the middle and two giant black bars on both sides. <comment150930> Instead of writing an answer to edit someone else's answer, simply click the edit button below the post that you wish to improve.
