Java 8, Update 73 not installing <body> I'm following the procedure on Oracle's website to install Java 8, update 73. When I get to step 5 in the procedure and click "Next," the installer window quietly shuts down without and without an error message and Java never installs. I have tried disabling SIP to no avail.   <answer230861> Uninstalling existing JRE per these instructions and installing the latest Java Development Kit from here did the trick.
