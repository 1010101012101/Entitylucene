Where is the "Double click on titlebar to minimize" setting located in Mavericks? <body> I just updated my MacBook Air to Mavericks and I can't find the checkbox to enable the "Double-click on window title to minimize it" feature.  I thought I was in the codeSystem preferences &gt; General/code pane, when I activated it, but that was in 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  <answer123224> The setting is in System Preferences - Dock  <answer123306> The option is 'Double click on a window's title-bar to maximize'.  <comment143974> Indeed it is. What a strange place for that to be. <comment143991> …on Windows, not OS X. <comment144018> Not sure why the downvotes, in OSX, Mavericks, System Preferences - Dock, the option he is talking about is 'Double click on a windows's title-bar to maximize' <comment144070> No, it's not — the option is *Double-click a window's title bar to minimize* and there is no maximise in OS X anyway.
