Some drives (including my own Time Capsule) have been permanently damaged.  If that happens to your TC, you will get a constant amber light and the wifi will continue to work until the hard drive is restarted, because the wifi needs to access info on the disk to restart - something to consider before you unplug your TC or do a soft or hard reset.  If you have any Western Digital external hard drive applications on your computer, you may want to remove them (google Western Digital and Mavericks if that's a concern).  Good luck!  <answer110773> In my case a serie of rabid and chaotic experiments with restarts and erasing a plist fixed the issue. Steps I did were:   ul liDisabled TM Backup/li liRemoved TimeCapsule from TM Backup Disk (this might not be necessary, you will not be able to add it again until it will start to work)/li liSaving a screenshot of Exluded paths in TM Options (just for the case)/li liRenamed /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist to *.bac/li liRestarted Mac/li liRestarted TimeMachine/li liRemoved /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist and renamed the old plist back/li liRestarted Mac again/li liAdded a TimeCapsule back to TimeMachine Backup Disks/li /ul  Hopefully it started to work. I don't know which of the steps were necessary and which just desperate.   <answer114813> In airport utility: change routermode from off(bridge mode) to DHCP + nat. After a reconnect, it works correctly.  <comment130402> When you click on the "Connect As..." button, are you prompted for your username and password? Are you able to connect to the Time Capsule in the Finder using Go - Connect to Server (you may be able to enter the IP address of Kapsle - possibly 10.0.1.1?) <comment130419> Hopefully not my case. After series of restarts and erasing plist it started to work properly.
