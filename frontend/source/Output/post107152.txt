Where did folder "merge" or "keep both" go in OS X 10.9 Mavericks? <body> Before Mavericks one could hold the ALT key and move a folder "A" onto a folder "B" where already an "A" existed. In this case Mac OS X asked in Lion if I want to strongmerge/strong - or on Mountain Lion if I want to strongkeep both/strong (which was also a merge).  I can't find this option in Mavericks.  Did Apple remove this useful feature?  Any hints?  sup(And yes: I own ForkLift, which can do it - I just sometimes still prefer the Finder)./sup  <answer107251> OK. I found out myself... Luckily Apple did not remove the Finder Merge functionality with Mavericks. But sometimes it is not offered to the user. But let me explain:  Supose you have a folder named TARGET with a subfolder TARGET/SomeStuff. And you have a SomeStuff folder somewhere else. Now drag this second SomeStuff folder to the TARGET folder (strongwithout any modifier keys pressed/strong) then the Finder will presented you the following dialog (Stop and Replace):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGIb6.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, no merge here.  Now - if you instead press the kbdAlt/kbd key while you drop the SomeStuff folder to the TARGET folder there are two possibilities:  1.) If the files in the two SomeStuff Folder have completely different (not overlapping) contents. In other words: no duplicate filenames. Then finder will give you these options (Stop, Merge &amp; Replace All):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sOMHQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, here you can merge. And the result will be a TARGET/SomeStuff folder with the content of both SomeStuff folders.  2.) But here comes what is sometimes confusing (and actually made me think merging is gone in Mavericks): if there exists at least one filename that is contained in both SomeStuff folders, then merging is not possible. Then the finder will offer you these options (Don't Replace, Stop, Replace):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6S4Ar.png" alt="enter image description here"  So, no merge possible, here too!  <answer107753> I just found this problem too.  I worked round it by using a simple command line codecp -r/code command in Terminal. It's crazy that you can't do it in the GUI!  precodecp -r ./srcFolder/ ./targetFolder/ /code/pre  <answer123608> h3Short answer/h3  Using the command line (Terminal):  precodecp -r -n ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/ /code/pre  The command above adds the codesrc/code content and the subdirectories to the codedestination/code without overwriting the content already present in the codedestination/code.  h3Long answer/h3  Even if the content overlaps, you can still use codecp/code to do it. Assume that you have two folders on your desktop: the codesrc/code and the codedestination/code folders and you want to merge codesrc/code into codedestination/code:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K7aNP.png" alt="enter image description here"  To merge, just do:  precodecp -r ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/ /code/pre  strongNOTE/strong When you use this, the content in codesrc/code overwrites the content in the codedestination/code folder and adds the extra stuff that are missing in the codedestination/code. It shouldn't matter if you just want to add the missing files from codesrc/code into codedestination/code.  strongALSO/strong it doesn't matter how many subdirectories are there, it will just go through each folder recursively and it will overwrite the content and will add the stuff that is missing in the codedestination/code folder.  strongBUT/strong  strongPITFALL/strong If you have huge files (like video files), you don't want to wait until everything is overwritten, it adds a lot of overhead.  strongPITFALL SOLUTION/strong: Instead, you can use the code-n/code flag to skip the overwriting:  precodecp -r -n ~/Desktop/src/* ~/Desktop/destination/ /code/pre  This is the description of the code-n/code flag from the man page:  precodeman cp /code/pre   precode -n    Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any        previous -f or -i options.) /code/pre   strongFurther Reading/strong  ol lihttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5088332/overhead-of-a-flag-in-cp-command/li /ol  <answer126708> For users who want an alternative GUI or fear terminal: here is a free App that I found that will merge folders for you.  http://subrosasoft.com/software/freeware/macmerger  Disclaimer: I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes the app.  The copywright is 2012. There is little feedback, but it seems to work fine.  <answer129826> I found this from Apple Support (http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14224), you need to choose "Keep newer" to merge, works for me:     Merge two folders      If you have two folders with identical names at two different locations, you can merge them into a single folder. To do so, you must copy (not move) one folder to the location that already contains a folder with the same name. In the dialog that appears, click Merge.      The Merge option appears only if one of the folders contains items that are not in the other folder. If the folders contain different versions of identically named files, the only options are Stop or Replace.   <answer136253> Having not found my answer above, I am compelled to redirect you to that other answer which rightly advices to use the ditto command:     In a Terminal, type: emditto from_folder destination_folder/em, for instance:  precode   ditto ./srcFolder ./targetFolder /code/pre   <comment125686> The feature still exists in 10.9 Holding down the ALT key while dragging still works. <comment125765> Yes - I knew about that pressing the ALT key is a precondidtion. Nevertheless my Mavericks did not present me the "Merge" option. But I found out why... - I will write an answer to my question. Thanks anyway! <comment135308> As much as Finder tries to help with file maintenance, I always feel better dropping into terminal and using `rsync`, `cp` and such. <comment139026> The filename contained in both folders threw me off! This helped me figure out why this feature seemed so finicky. <comment140034> I think there is the best solution there is... I can never seem to make sense of how to make the "Merge" options appear in Finder when I need it. <comment142194> I just wasted about 1 hour because of this... In the end I just did it with the command line.  Seriously I cannot believe they made this change! <comment146187> It's probably a good idea to add the `-n` switch to avoid overwriting files, because it might take forever if you have large files that you are trying to merge. So it will be like : `cp -r -n ~/src/* ~/destination/` <comment229542> What do you do if this entire window has disappeared? I never get this to appear when I am dragging folders now. And the computer just does nothing. Doesn't move files. Doesn't tell me anything. Suggestions on how to bring this back?
