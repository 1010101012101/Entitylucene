What is ScriptEditor2? <body> It appears in my usage report in Settings as having 0.4KB of Documents and Data, but I've never installed anything by that name. It doesn't appear as an app on my home screen, and a Spotlight search turns up nothing. For that matter, a emGoogle/em search turns up nothing. What the heck emis/em it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PQVv6.png" alt="Manage Storage screen, including an app called &quot;ScriptEditor2&quot;"  <answer122954> codecom.apple.ScriptEditor2/code is the codeCFBundleIdentifier/code for strongAppleScript Editor.app/strong.  The 0.4KB of iCloud data associated with ScriptEditor2 is likely to be a shared preference file created by AppleScript Editor on your Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrZax.png" alt="AppleScript Editor icon"  <comment143525> what does it do? <comment143527> That's *my* question. <comment143528> Oh, I see, this is my *iCloud* usage, not my iPhone usage. That makes much more sense. :)
