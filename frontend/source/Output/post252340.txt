Android device connection broken in Sierra <body> I've recently updated my MBP Retina 2013 to Sierra GM, and today it stopped to connect the Android devices.  I have Android SDK installed and lots of devices available with different OS versions. But when I connect them to my MacBook, they are only charging, ADB does not work and I do not see them connected to USB at all:  precode$ ioreg -p IOUSB +-o Root  &lt;class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 17&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@1d000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000002c4, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 9&gt;   | +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1d100000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002c6, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 12&gt;   |   +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1d180000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002e8, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 13&gt;   |     +-o Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad@1d182000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000309, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (162 ms), retain 15&gt;   |     +-o BRCM20702 Hub@1d181000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000324, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 12&gt;   |       +-o Bluetooth USB Host Controller@1d181300  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000352, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 17&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@1a000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000002cb, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 9&gt;   | +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1a100000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002cd, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 12&gt;   |   +-o FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)@1a110000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000503, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (114 ms), retain 19&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@14000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000012c4, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 8&gt; /code/pre  When I connect my iPhone:  precode$ ioreg -p IOUSB +-o Root  &lt;class IORegistryEntry, id 0x100000100, retain 17&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@1d000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000002c4, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 9&gt;   | +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1d100000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002c6, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 12&gt;   |   +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1d180000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002e8, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 13&gt;   |     +-o Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad@1d182000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000309, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (172 ms), retain 15&gt;   |     +-o BRCM20702 Hub@1d181000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000324, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 12&gt;   |       +-o Bluetooth USB Host Controller@1d181300  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000352, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 17&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@1a000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000002cb, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (11 ms), retain 9&gt;   | +-o IOUSBHostDevice@1a100000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x1000002cd, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (12 ms), retain 12&gt;   |   +-o FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in)@1a110000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100000503, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (122 ms), retain 19&gt;   +-o Root Hub Simulation Simulation@14000000  &lt;class AppleUSBRootHubDevice, id 0x1000012c4, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (1 ms), retain 9&gt;     +-o iPhone@14200000  &lt;class AppleUSBDevice, id 0x100001414, registered, matched, active, busy 0 (3 ms), retain 19&gt; /code/pre  I've already tried:  ul liWindows way (reboot MacBook, reboot devices)./li liUse different USB cable./li liConnect to different port (2 available)./li liUse different devices (already tried 3 Samsung devices, 1 Asus and 1 HTC)./li /ul  Everything was fine for a few days after the update, but does not work today.  Any suggestions?  <answer252803> One thing I noticed you haven't tried is resetting the PRAM/NVRAM or the SMC.  strongResetting the PRAM/NVRAM/strong  Older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM). Here’s how to reset your PRAM/NVRAM:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the power button emand then/em press the command-option-p-r keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  Your computer's System Management Controller (SMC) can also be reset. The instructions for resetting your SMC depend on three things:  ul liDoes your device run from a built-in battery? em(In your case, yes)/em/li liDoes your device run from a removable battery? /li liDoes your device just run off power from the wall?/li /ul  Now, for the sake of others who may come here looking for answers to the same issue, I will provide the process for all three.   strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time shift-option-control (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the power button/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the power button for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  strongFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liUnplug it from the power/li liPress and hold the power button for 5 seconds/li liPlug it back in and turn it on./li /ol  Hope this helps. Please report back and let us know.  <answer253431> Finally, the problem resolved by itself. I don't know how and why, but now I can connect any Android device.  Very strange bug.  @Monomeeth, thanks for guide anyway!
