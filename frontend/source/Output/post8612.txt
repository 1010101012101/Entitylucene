How can I take a picture with my iSight camera? <body> I have a MacBook Air which has a built in camera. Is there any simple application (preferably one that comes with Mac OS X) which simply takes a picture and saves it as PNG or JPG?  <answer8613> Yes, the application is called "Photo Booth," and lives, I'm pretty sure, in /Applications/Photo Booth.app  After you've taken a photo, you can drag an image to the desktop or to a folder in the Finder to save as a jpg image.  <answer8616> Doesn't come pre-installed with OS X but isightcapture supports command-line picture-taking with the built-in (or external) iSight.  <answer24563> ImageSnap is another great command line utility for picture taking or video recording from a connected camera (whether it's your iSight camera or a plugged-in camera). It's a handy little application.  <comment113631> is also available on macports
