Apple Configurator 2 won't prepare <body> Using Apple Configurator 2. I connect an IPad and hit prepare. It says that the device has already been prepared.  I erase the device, it restarts and goes through all the steps for setup (even though I chose to skip all steps for prepare).  On the apple configurator 2, during the restart process it tries to "Downloading activation records for device" and keeps going step 1 of 2, then 2 of 3, 3 of 4 etc.... It continuously fails and won't see the IPad as prepared.  The device restarts and appears like a regular device that I can setup as one usually would from the store.  I have no idea how to get the ipad to prepare so I can run it in single app mode.  strongemUpdate/em/strong During setup it states the iPad is linked to my account (it was setup once before as a normal iPad).  <comment372085> I have updated my ipad and my computer to latest software
