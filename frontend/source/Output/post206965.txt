Relationship between OpenType fonts and PostScript printers, and impact on printing performance? <body> In the pre-OS X days, there was an important distinction between bitmap fonts and PostScript fonts, and between QuickDraw printers (the Mac equivalent of "Winprinters") and much more expensive PostScript printers.  If you wanted to use a PostScript font with a PostScript printer, you needed to have installed on your computer the bitmap equivalent of one of the standard preinstalled PostScript fonts.  Later, it became more common to make sure that the PostScript font "suitcase" was in the right place to download to the printer at print time, and use Adobe Type Manager to display it antialiased on the screen.  In contrast, most fonts installed with OS X by default and available for purchase are either OpenType or TrueType format.  Many inexpensive laser printers now speak PostScript level II or level III, and in consequence include an even larger assortment of built-in PS fonts than PS level I printers such as the original LaserWriters.  According to Adobe, OpenType is a superset of the PostScript font format, and OpenType is supported by PostScript printers:     OpenType development has improved both the support of Type 1 on Windows and the support of TrueType in the PostScript environment, ensuring that customers who use PostScript printers will have the best possible experience regardless of the font type used. Support for OpenType is part of the PostScript printing system, with the support of the latest AdobePSâ„¢ printer drivers and Adobe Type Manager.   Exactly what "support for OpenType" at the beginning of the second sentence means here is pretty unclear to me, though.  If I want to use a PostScript printer with OS X, will it make a difference in printing speed or quality if I use a font on the computer that is (or is not) in the list of fonts on the printer?  How does this work?  ul liFor example, if I print a TextEdit document in (OpenType) Helvetica to a networked LaserWriter, does OS X send PostScript code to the printer, which then uses its own built-in Helvetica font data in ROM to construct the glyphs on the page?/li liWhat if I use an OpenType font that's on the computer but not on the printer?  Does the font get translated into a PostScript font then downloaded to the printer (presumably a slower process just like it was in the pre-OS X days), which then prints with it as if it were built-in?/li liOr in the previous case do the OpenType glyphs get rasterized on the OS X side and then sent to the printer as a bitmap?/li liIn either case, how does this affect the quality of printed output?/li liWhether the OpenType font is downloaded as a PS font or as a bitmap, I'm guessing this would take a lot more memory on the printer side than just sending PostScript code.  Should I worry about running out of printer memory (or at very least my document taking a emlong/em time to print) just as in the pre-OS X days?/li liIs it still worthwhile to seek out a printer with a built-in hard drive to store downloaded fonts, if I'm going to be doing a lot of printing with fonts that aren't part of the native printer-resident set?/li liAre there printers that get around some or all of these problems by coming bundled with OpenType fonts as part of their firmware, or at least printing with OpenType fonts directly?  This seems like the natural next step beyond inexpensive networkable printers with Postscript Level III support such as this Okidata model./li /ul  <comment274205> "Unclear" should be listed in the index of Adobe specifications, with page references running on for several columns. I stumbled across this post while looking for the answer to a simple question, directly related to yours: I know about the Type 42 feature in PostScript. You can put a TrueType font into a Type 42 wrapper, download it to a PostScript printer, and a built-in rasterizer will render the characters. But what about OpenType? I know it contains CFF outlines, but how do you get from point A (the OTF file) to point B (downloading and rasterizing in the printer)? Sorry I can't answer. I
