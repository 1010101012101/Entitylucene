How can I recover files from an iPod classic (when using as a hard disk) after reformatting? <body> Recently, my 120 GB iPod classic was not being recognised by my MacBook and kept prompting to reformat. I have done this many times before but make it a conscious effort to back up my files before I do so. I genuinely forgot about the folder I had saved on my iPod classic (when using it as a hard disk) and went ahead to reformat it. A week later I realised I forgot to back up my files but it was too late. I want to retrieve the files really badly as they were pictures/memories!  Is it possible to retrieve without paying for those softwares?  <answer125367> If you are comfortable with the command line, try TestDisk  It's fairly intuitive for a command line program.  The basic steps are as follows:  ol liDownload from above link./li liExtract download./li liNavigate to extracted folder in Terminal./li liRun code./testdisk/code/li liFollow the onscreen instructions./li /ol  Note: You may want to read the documentation before you do anything. The documentation links are about halfway down the page I linked previously. The instructions are for NTFS, but I imagine it will be a similar process for HFS.
