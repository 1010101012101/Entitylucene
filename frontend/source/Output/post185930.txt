How to make truly single spaced bullet items in Keynote <body> Although I have selected      Spacing 1.0 - single   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TrEoO.jpg" alt=""  in the strongText Style/strong, we can see that there is still large space between each bullet item. How to compact them?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBBBl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer190312> Notice the disclosure arrow "▶︎" beside strongSpacing/strong?  There you can reveal the paragraph spacing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ftpqS.png" alt="Spacing settings Keynote"  Change the strongBefore Paragraph/strong and strongAfter Paragraph/strong to 0 pt or the desired amount.  Hope this helps!  <comment225868> thx! that's it! <comment225869> So glad that helped!  Those disclosure arrows are easy to overlook.
