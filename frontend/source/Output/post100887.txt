ram upgrade works in safe mode but not in normal mode <body> I have new installed 8 gb ram in to my 2010 imac i3.   It kernel panic when booted, but worked when I start it in safe mode.  It also shows as 12 GB ram. ( 4 Gb original and 8 gb new. )  How can I make it work in normal mode ?  <answer100891> Safe mode does not utilize the full 12 gig.  I would do the RAM test to make sure it is working.  Here is a link to a very good way to do that.     Download MemTest for Mac for Free      Memtest is from the broader UNIX world and it that has been ported to   Mac OS X.  For whatever reason, there are some websites who are   charging for the free utility, but you should not need to pay for it   because it is free, open source, and there are Mac versions available   from developers as free downloads:   <answer100980> First thing is to simply remove and reseat the chips. Restart, zapping the P-RAM as you go - might be surprised to find it's all okay.  <comment118810> did you verify that you bought the right RAM for your machine? (just do a search for "what RAM for my mac") <comment118884> I did, what i wonder is it is working in safe mode, but not in normal mode. <comment118961> yea, as long as you know it's the right kind it's highly likely it's just a bad RAM stick. let them know and they'll swap it out pretty quickly for you I'd bet.
