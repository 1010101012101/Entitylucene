Tried to change the name of my home folder and now I can't log in <body> I'm on OS X 10.10.5  I followed the instructions given here.  I'll describe my process in as much detail as possible.  ol liI made a temporary admin account called temp. /li liI switched to that account./li liI renamed the home directory of my main account from oldname/ to newname/, providing my temporary admin account password when prompted./li liI went into system preferences and changed the account name and home directory for the main account to newname and /Users/newname respectively./li liI logged out and attempted to log in to my now renamed main account./li liMy main account was not given as an option in the log in screen./li liI restarted the computer, and still my main account was not an option at the log in screen./li liAt this point I was freaking out, but upon signing into my temporary admin account I opened terminal and was able to locate my old home directory (now re-named). Entering 'ls -l' into the shell shows that the renamed home directory is owned by a user having the renamed account name./li /ol  Here is the crux: strongI can still log in to that account using terminal./strong   In system preferences the re-named account still exists. It seems I just can't log in to it with the GUI. What's going on here an how do I fix it?  <comment257298> Have you tried fixing disk permissions with Disk Utility? <comment257315> Disk Util won't fix home folder perms. Onyx will, if you're still on Yosemite, but the option seems to be gone in El Cap, presumably because you're not supposed to be able to break them any more.
