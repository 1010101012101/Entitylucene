How to view home directory with Finder <body> Brand new to Mac OS, coming from Linux.  Almost everything I do is out of my home dir ("code~//code", or on Mac, "code/Users/myuser//code"). But when I open up the Finder app, I can't figure out how to view  my home dir:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQUAP.png" alt="enter image description here"  At first glance, it seems like my only options are codeDesktop/code, codeDocuments/code or codeDownloads/code.  So I ask: strongfrom this screen shot, how do I get to my home directory?/strong  <answer204430> You need to open finder's preferences and check your username :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3DmDu.png" alt="Finder"  You'll be able to find your home directory in finder next.  <answer204434> Notwithstanding Hamsa'a answer [which is correct] you can add any location to that 'Favourites' list just by dragging it from the directories on the right into a gap the list on the left. [Dragging on top will move/copy to that location, hence, drop it between existing items.]  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tG6sr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer204469> Yet another option: whether or not you've added the home folder to the Finder sidebar, you can choose Home from the Finder's Go menu, or use the keyboard shortcut kbdCommand/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdH/kbd. The keyboard shortcut also works in the standard Open and Save dialogs.  <comment246397> To add, in Finder preferences on the General tab, you can set new Finder windows to open your home directory (like when you click on the Finder icon in the Dock without any windows already open, or if you use cmd+n)
