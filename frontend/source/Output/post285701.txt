Does MacOS Support a Snapshot-Style Filesystem? <body> I would like to perform daily snapshots that I can revert to if someone:  ul lidownloads Malware  /li liinstalls buggy software/li lietc./li /ul  Does such a thing exist?  Is there a roadmap for it?  I have a Fusion drive so that would affect my personal situation but I am just asking the general question.  <answer285705> Apple's new file system, APFS, supports snapshots.  Per their documentation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qP3cK.png" alt="enter image description here"  APFS is available in 10.12.x (Sierra) as a Developer Preview and as a released product in 10.13.x (High Sierra).  Earlier than Sierra, if you need to make a "point in time" backup, it's best to run Time Machine to ensure a good backup.  <answer285721> If you can't wait for APFS, you could look into OpenZFS, an implementation of Sun/Oracle's ZFS filesystem. It seems like you can make it work on a macOS boot drive (don't know about Fusion drives), though it's certainly not trivial.  <comment360395> Does Time Machine not do what you want to do? <comment360397> Not really.  A snapshot would be instant.  Time Machine would require a restore.    Can you restore to an image (i.e. an identical copy) as of a certain time using Time Machine? <comment360398> IIRC, [APFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_File_System) supports snapshots, but I don't know much about it.  It's still "experimental" though. <comment360400> Thanks for the answer.  I have Sierra but, reading the documentation, it's only available as a Developer Preview.  That means a [couple of things](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/FAQ/FAQ.html): 1. You can't put it on your boot drive; and 2. You can't put it on a Fusion drive. <comment360419> APFS can not be used on a startup volume though. (Yet?) <comment360420> @StephenRasku: Look for announcements about APFS at WWDC next week. My guess is that in 10.13 it'll be usable as a startup volume, but will probably not support Fusion Drive. Fusion Drive is built on top of Core Storage, and APFS doesn't use that. Also, Fusion Drive is really a stopgap for the period when SSDs aren't big enough to be the sole storage device, and need to be paired with a big HD; APFS is really intended for the pure-SSD future. P.S. I reserve the right to delete this comment on Monday, when it turns out I'm completely wrong. <comment372045> When I last checked, APFS was still a _developer preview_ technology – **not production quality** – in pre-release macOS 10.13.
