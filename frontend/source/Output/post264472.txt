Facetime Icon is greyed out for some but not all contacts <body> MacBook Air 11 inch early 2015, Sierra, Version 10.12.1.   This glitch actually came on after updating to Yosemite (using Time Machine) and stayed there after updating to Sierra using Time Machine transfer again.   In CONTACTS, several,  but not all,  contacts,  show Facetime icons greyed out on the MacBook, they are synchronized to IPhone 6 and iPod. On iPhone these contacts show up with greyed out Facetime icon with the word Video underneath. I cannot Facetime such contacts, but they can and do Facetime me. If I want to Facetime them I have to phone them first and ask them to Facetime me. Other contacts show normal lit up Facetime icon and I can Facetime without problems.   <comment331439> Is this problem only happening on the MacBook Air? Or is it also happening on iPhone and iPod? <comment331447> happens on all of them. <comment331455> Have you tried turning off iCloud Sync for Contacts and then turning it back on? Maybe if you do this it will remove and then restore all your contacts and it'll fix the issue. <comment331596> Yes I have, didn't help, thanks though
