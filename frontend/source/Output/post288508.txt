Safe to erase Apple Sd card reader media <body> Is it safe to erase Apple Sd Card Reader Media in disk utility? Because Disk utility finds some corruption with it.  <comment364322> Go ahead and erase it if there's nothing on it you need. If Disk Utility still finds that it is corrupted when reformatting, then throw it in the trash & get a newer, larger SD card. If you use this SD card in a real camera, try formatting it through the camera's built-in utility. <comment364323> Thanks I will try it soon. <comment364325> tbh, if it's starting to act up - just bin it anyway & get a new one. Weigh up the cost of a card against the value of the data entrusted to it.
