Little Snitch shows ping flood to 0.0.0.192 <body> My Little Snitch Network Monitor tells me my machine is ping'ing 0.0.0.192 every second.  What's going on?  EDIT:   A Wireshark capture tells me this ping has  Source 0.0.76.188  Destination 0.0.0.192  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vt7FN.png" alt="Wireshark Capture"  <comment270319> ..what process ? <comment270329> It just shows 'ping'  I'd expect it to show 'ping via xxxxx' but it just shows 'ping' <comment270362> Did you modify ip tables or did some other reroute configuration? The obvious cause would be a modification or piece of software that someone installed. <comment270365> Not that I'm aware of.  A `netstat -nr` doesn't show any non-standard things <comment270438> Looks like a maroding wildcard mask... <comment272226> After another 1+ million pings I still haven't found why. <comment338941> Can you show us the detail of a full packet? <comment339016> @OrtomalaLokni a couple macbooks and OSX releases later, the problem has since been vanished.  Will definitely get back to this thread when/if it comes back.
