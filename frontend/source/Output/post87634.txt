How can I hide a partition (or prevent it from mounting)? <body> How can I hide a partition (or prevent it from mounting)? I want an effect similar to the recovery partition: it's completely undetectable outside of Disk Utility/the boot menu.  <answer87643> Partitions that are mounted in Mac OSX are generally present in the file /etc/fstab that is read upon boot. If you just comment out (i.e. put a # in front of it, and save the file) the line that referes to the drive you do not want to mount, it will not mount upon next boot.  strongedit/strong FYI.

So instead of having people read through a Apple Discussions thread guessing what exactly and which post you had in mind, can you please summarize the key items here? Or even better: add a sample fstab entry to your answer? (The asker is using 10.8 actually)
