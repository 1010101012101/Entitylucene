Prevent partitions from Spotlight indexing each other <body> I have a single MacBook Pro partitioned into two drives, each running a copy of Mountain Lion. In Partition X, I would like to disable Spotlight from indexing Partition Y. In Partition Y, I want to disable Spotlight indexing of Partition X.  h3Clarification:/h3  Under emSystem Preferences  Spotlight  Privacy/em, setting Partition X to prevent indexing of Partition Y emalso prevents Partition Y from indexing Partition Y/em. I.e., the privacy settings are preserved across partitions. I am looking for unique privacy settings for each partition.  <answer95974> ul licodeSystem Preferences.. &gt; Spotlight &gt; Privacy/code/li liAdd the mount path you don't want indexed to the list by selecting the device you want excluded also. However, if it's hidden use kbdstrong⌘/strong/kbd +kbdstrong⇧/strong/kbd+kbdstrongG/strong/kbd and enter the path name for example code/Volumes/Partition Y/code./li /ul  strongNote/strongbr After some testing this method does not work with multiple partitions of like OSs (eg. 10.8 on partition A and 10.8 on partition B) but does seem to work if each OS is different. Still not 100% clear on why this is since each drive has it's own code/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist/code or code/.Spotlight-V100/Store-V1/Exclusions.plist/code  <comment112649> Is that different than selecting the partition from the Finder sidebar? <comment112651> No, I clarified my answer, you can also just select it from the sidebar. <comment112654> Okay, thanks. That's what I thought you meant. The trouble with this is that the volume is then ignored on the other partition (itself) as well. I want each partition to ignore the other one but index itself. <comment112658> yes so in your example when you are booted onto part-X exclude part-Y, when when you boot into part-Y exclude part-X. I have a machine with 4 partitions and different ignore rules for each. that should function, though I'm testing on 2x10.6's, 1x10.7 and 1x 10.9. <comment112669> @ele So after a little more tinkering I found as long as you select the mount path e.g. `/Volumes/partname` and not `/` it seems to work. in otherwords use the goto folder shortcut and browse to `/Volumes` then select the volume to ignore from there. Hope that works for you. if so I'll fix up the question again. <comment112713> I'm afraid it behaves the same way. If I exclude `/Volumes/Macintosh HD 2` from Spotlight while booted into `Macintosh HD`, then `Macintosh HD 2` is still excluded from the Spotlight of `Macintosh HD 2`. Some further research suggests disabling the volumes from mounting at startup. <comment317064> Is there any update on this? I have the same issue with a dual boot MacBook (with two physical drives) that has 10.8.x and 10.12.x. When I exclude 10.12.x on the 10.8.x drive, it gets excluded also on the 10.12.x drive itself and vice versa. That seems ridiculous. <comment323539> Did you find any solution to this? I use macOS 10.12 on one and OS X 10.11 on the other partition, and I've got the very same problem you mentioned in the comment below. <comment323543> I'm afraid I gave up without ever finding a solution.
