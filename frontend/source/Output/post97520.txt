How do I disable Swipe Between Pages on Safari <body> I am trying to find how to enable and disable the Swipe between pages gesture via the defaults command either system wide or just for Safari. I can't do it manually as we will need to do this on machines on mass.  Setting in the UI is located at "AppleSystem PreferencesTrackpadMore Gestures". I have looked all over the net and found plenty of enteries for Chrome but none for Safari.  I have tried adding AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls to com.apple.Safari with defaults but doesn't seem to work at all.  <answer97521> There is a free program called Better Touch Tool (http://www.boastr.de/) which allows you to disable gestures, or set specific gestures, on a per-app basis.  <answer97522> Try adding AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls to .GlobalPreferences instead of com.apple.Safari:  precodedefaults write .GlobalPreferences AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls 0 /code/pre  (I'm not sure if this will take effect before you log out &amp; back in.)  <answer97767> After speaking with apple they gave us the following script which did the trick:  precode#!/bin/sh  os_vers=`sw_vers -productVersion`  if [[ $os_vers =~ "10.7" ]] || [[ $os_vers =~ "10.8" ]];then     su -l $3 -c "defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool false"     su -l $3 -c "defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.threeFingerHorizSwipeGesture -int 0"     su -l $3 -c "defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.fourFingerHorizSwipeGesture -int 0"     su -l $3 -c "defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.threeFingerVertSwipeGesture -int 0"     su -l $3 -c "defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.fourFingerVertSwipeGesture -int 0" fi  if [[ $os_vers =~ "10.8" ]];then     su -l $3 -c "defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.twoFingerFromRightEdgeSwipeGesture -int 0" fi /code/pre  They also attibuted this article as to where they got it from: https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=7047  <comment114414> Missed the "can't do it manually part" of your question.  Adding a new tool to many computers is probably not high on your wish list... <comment114415> Thanks for the suggestion. I might have a look at it anyway, if I can figure out what it changes I might be able to replicate that. <comment114418> Still no joy. Rebooted and the setting is still enabled. <comment114421> It's writing the setting to the plist but its not using it :(. <comment114527> Very strange; I finally got around to testing it, and it worked -- I didn't even have to log out, just quit & relaunch Safari. I also found that a setting in the com.apple.Safari domain overrides one in .GlobalPreferences, so *that* should've worked as well. At this point, I'm not sure what's going on. <comment114739> Got in touch with our Apple contact and they sent us this script which did the trick:
