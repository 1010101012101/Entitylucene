What is com.apple.launchctl.Aqua? <body> While troubleshooting a slow boot time in Lion (10.7), I saw these lines in the sys log:  precode8/21/13 8:47:45.102 PM com.apple.launchctl.Aqua: load: option requires an argument -- D 8/21/13 8:47:45.102 PM com.apple.launchctl.Aqua: usage: launchctl load [-wF] [-D &lt;user|local|network|system|all&gt;] paths... /code/pre  So naturally I want to find out where this script is and why it has this error.  I searched the usual LaunchAgent and LaunchDaemon directories, and then searched the whole hard drive, but could not find a script by that name.  <answer99673> com.apple.launchctl.aqua is codelaunchctl/code. If you run strings over launchctl in /bin/launchctl it returns Aqua in amongst other strings.   I would say another script is trying to load and launchctl is failing to do so which is why you've got that error message.   I would list what processes are loaded and see if anything that is in your agent/daemon dirs isn't loading as expected.
