iCloud drive is only containing apps folders <body> On iOS 10 Beta, I was able to see all my files/folders contained into my iCloud drive on my iPad.   Since I have installed the official iOs 10 release, I'm only able to see my apps folders [Preview, Pages...]... But the files are still available into the iCloud drive of my Mac.  It's a bug or there is a way to recover my files on iPad ?
