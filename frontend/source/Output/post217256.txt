Parallels Desktop 9 Time Machine HDS backup is old <body> I had a problem with a Window XP VM and restored from Time Machine.  Much to my dismay the backup is from 8 months ago.  I looked at the contents of the Time Machine and I have about 15 copies of the old HDS file.  I don't have the VM excluded back TM backups, but I did not have SmartGuard turned on.  Anyone know why I would have so many old copies of the hard disk image?  UPDATE:  when I say I "looked at the context of the Time Machine", I mean that I opened a terminal, cd'd to the disk containing the TM file hierarchy (cmd below executed from the Backups.backupdb/machine_folder), cand executed a command like:  precodels -l 201?-*/Macintosh\ HD/Users/me/Documents/Parallels/vmname.pvm/vmname-0.hdd/ | grep hds /code/pre  This returned a list like:  precode100477952 -rw-------+ 1 me staff 102889422848 Mar  9  2015 vmname-0.hdd.0.{5fbaabe3-6958-40ff-92a7-860e329aab41}.hds 100477952 -rw-------+ 1 me staff 102889422848 Mar  9  2015 vmname-0.hdd.0.{5fbaabe3-6958-40ff-92a7-860e329aab41}.hds 100477952 -rw-------+ 1 me staff 102889422848 Mar  9  2015 vmname-0.hdd.0.{5fbaabe3-6958-40ff-92a7-860e329aab41}.hds /code/pre  These lines are pulled from multiple folders like 2015-11-10-133112 (i.e., the timestamp of the backup).  <comment262660> How did you "look at the contents of the Time Machine"? Through the regular Time Machine app? <comment262662> at the command line using a command like:      ls -l 201?-*/Macintosh\ HD/Users/name/Documents/Parallels/vmname.pvm/vmname-0.hdd/ | grep hds <comment263127> what you did was find every backup of that one file. The * should match every time stamp directory, and recurse through them. <comment263195> understand that -- that was my point: drilling into every time stamp directory and then getting the long format list of each version of that file was what I wanted to do -- I thought that I would see different dates for that file in different time stamp directory hierarchies. <comment263200> Those files are hard links, so they wouldn't have different time stamps. <comment263247> Not sure I see where you're going -- it's the hard source of the data you're concerned with, yes?  A symbolic link ultimately refers to a hard link (unless it's broken).  Is there something fundamental about Time Machine that I am missing here? I'd love to be wrong about the data not being current.
