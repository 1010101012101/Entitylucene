Can't install bundler using gem <body> I'm trying to install Bundler on my Mac which is running OS X El Capitan Public Beta 6 (15A278b).  I try codesudo gem install bundler/code but I get the following error back     ERROR: While executing gem ...

If you ever have to use codesudo/code while installing/upgrading a gem then you're walking towards trouble, if not already there.  <comment246236> It seems as if you need to disable rootless. Since you are using beta software the procedure may change but you can try `sudo nvram boot-args="rootless=0";sudo reboot`. <comment246239> Still doesn't work <comment246240> You'll need to disable rootless my going into Recovery HD and turning it off. <comment315304> You can re-enable SIP once installation is complete. SIP was non-existent on prior versions of OS X so you're not creating a huge security hole. <comment364196> Fighting Apple's security practices by disabling it wholesale is both a losing battle and counter-productive. Bundler recommends `-n /usr/local/bin` gem installs now, as do most other active ruby projects.
