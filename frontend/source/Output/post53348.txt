Change Lion's Mail 'Archive' and 'Junk Mail' Folders <body> I have a hosted Exchange 2010 (Office 365) mailbox and use it together with Lion/Apple Mail but I was wondering how I can change were Mail stores Junk Mail to as well as its 'Archive' folder (the one it uses when selecting a mail in my inbox and click the 'Archive' button)?  For the Junk Mail one there already is one by Exchange / Office365 but Mail does not use this one (and selecting the correct folder and trying to go to 'Mailbox'  'Use this Mailbox for' fails because all entries (incl. 'Junk') is greyed out so no way I can't Mail stop from creating a new Junk folder every time I run Mail and it decides a mail is spam &amp; moves it there.  For the 'Archive' functionality it is somewhat the same - I have my own 'Archived' folder (in a particular subdirectory) and while I could certainly change my whole way of managing &amp; archiving mails, it would be quite surprising if the 'Archive'-folder Mail creates &amp; uses is hard-coded.  Does anyone know where/how to change Mail's default folders for these two? I had a quick glimpse at my user's com.apple.mail.plist file but couldn't find anything.
