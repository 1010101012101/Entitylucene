How to choke network preformance on OS X <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How to simulate slow internet connections on the mac       For testing purposes I would like to choke the performance of the network on my OS X 10.8.2 machine.  I have currently Little Snitch installed, which I can block access to certain hosts with... however I would like to lower the network performance as if I would be using an 56k6 old-school modem.   How can I accomplish this?  <answer72232> Although you can use command-line tools to do this, Apple has a developer tool that allows you to do what you are talking about from a control panel. There are presets available, or you can set your own performance limits. The tool is called "Network Link Conditioner" and is available on Apple's developer download site with a package called "Hardware IO Tools for Xcode".  Here is a blog post discussing the tool (with screen shots): http://mattgemmell.com/2011/07/25/network-link-conditioner-in-lion/  <answer72233> After some more searching and talking with a friend of mine, I found the codeHardware I/O tools for XCode/code which has the codeNetwork Link Conditioner/code which does this kind of things.  https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode%20-#  <comment83852> I just found about that. Thanks. The link, however, is https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=for%20Xcode%20-# <comment83875> Great wording - I'll point this to the canonical question we have on this tool and this will help guide everyone to the answers we have on Network Link conditioner. <comment83879> Thnx! Good idea. <comment83880> +1 for the link to the article - feel free to add that to the existing answers on the main thread for this. It's a very good article.
