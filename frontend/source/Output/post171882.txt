How to change Artist profile image? <body> Is there anyway to force/change/reset the profile image that shows up for an Artist in iTunes?  <answer171885> If you've added custom artwork to an Artist, it will replace the individual Album Artwork that iTunes had previously set.  To clear it, you need to clear each affected album - which can be done as a bulk selection, using shift/click to select all its tracks [but doesn't work if you select more than one Album]br then    ul liCmd/I to Get Info  /li liArtwork Tab  /li liSelect the Custom picture  /li liDelete or Backspace  /li liOK  /li liFile Menu  Library  Get Album Artworkbr You can do the last step once only, after resetting all the tracks you need to clear the Custom picture from./li /ul  <answer172172> No, when there are artist photos, they are downloaded from the iTunes Store. You can't change them.   <comment204421> Well, they do seem to change as I add albums to iTunes, I can't quite figure it out but it seems that the latest album I add becomes the cover art for the "artist".
