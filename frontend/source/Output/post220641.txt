update_terminal_cwd demystified please? <body> I am trying to find the documentation on what, exactly, the codeprintf/code command is doing in codeupdate_terminal_cwd/code.  If you didn't know already, the codeupdate_terminal_cwd/code function is defined (at least on Mac OS X 10.7.4) in code/etc/bashrc/code and in that same file the function is added to the code$PROMPT_COMMAND/code so that it runs every time you hit enter in the Terminal.  The text of the codeupdate_terminal_cwd/code function itself is as follows:  precodeupdate_terminal_cwd() {     # Identify the directory using a "file:" scheme URL,     # including the host name to disambiguate local vs.     # remote connections. Percent-escape spaces. local SEARCH=' ' local REPLACE='%20' local PWD_URL="file://$HOSTNAME${PWD//$SEARCH/$REPLACE}" printf '\e]7;%s\a' "$PWD_URL" } /code/pre  This is a few steps down the rabbit hole from trying to set my Terminal tab names from the command line, which can be done rather easily, but the tab name gets reset when codessh/codeing into a box.  This led me to How to stop automatic changing of iTerm titles? and the rather obscure list of control sequences on the Mac.  If you go to that last link and search for the string codeosc ps ; pt bel/code, you will find the section which defines the escape character that makes tab renaming work.  However, while that explains codeprintf '\e]1;%s\a'/code (note the "1"), it doesn't explain what the "7" does in the codeupdate_terminal_cwd/code function I quoted above.  Where is this documented??  (And why does codePWD_URL/code include the prefix codefile:///code?)  <answer223574> from Terminal.app v2.6.1 (OS X 10.11), under Preferences/Profiles/Window, there is highlighted text "Escape sequence..." which says:     The working directory and location of the current document may be set   using the Operating System Command (OSC) escape sequence:      ESC ] Ps ; Pt BEL      The parameter Ps is either 6 (document) or 7 (working directory) and   Pt is a “file:” URL. The URL should include a hostname to disambiguate   local and remote paths, and characters must be percent-encoded as   appropriate.      When both the working directory and document are set only the document   is displayed.   also, from Preferences/Profiles/Tab:     Window and tab titles may be set using the Operating System Command   (OSC) escape sequence:      ESC ] Ps ; Pt BEL      The parameter Ps is either 1 (tab title—aka “icon title”) or 2 (window   title) and Pt is the title text.      A custom window title will be displayed within the tab title (along   with the other selected items) if there is no custom tab title.      The following example bash command sets the tab title to “My Tab”:      codeprintf '\e]1;%s\a' 'My Tab'/code   <comment336370> The remote ssh box's prompt might be sending some title-changing strings that reset your local terminal's title.  I noticed that something like `sleep 5` updates part of the tab and window title to be `sleep`, but I'm not sure how it is triggered.
