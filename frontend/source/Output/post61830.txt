Altimeter app that records <body> I'm looking for a gps based altimeter app that records elevation to the phone. I will be out of cell range so it needs to store data on the phone.  Do you know of one?  <answer62150> Have a look at Gaia GPS app. It works offline and has a free version so you can do your test before buying.  <answer140136> I use Altimeter GPS for iPhone and it works very well for me! Try it!  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/altimeter-gps-elevation-compass/id572227849?l=it&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8
