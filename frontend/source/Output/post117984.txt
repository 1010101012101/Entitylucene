How do I get the date to show up on pictures with an iPhone 5? <body> How do I get the date to show on pictures? I have an iPhone 5?  <answer117985> This currently isn't possible in Photos.app unless you're looking at photos from a Shared Photo Stream (the photo's date is shown on the photo detail view).  You can get a rough date by looking at the Moments view — the photos taken between two dates are grouped together in chronological order.  You can use Apple's iPhoto, or third-party apps such as PhotoCal or PhotoHistory though.     ★ Sorting photos / videos by datebr   All of your photos / videos will be sorted by the date automatically. It's so useful to check the date and the time of photos / videos in the photo album.br   sup— PhotoCal/sup   <answer216740> I had this same annoyance - trying to sort thousands of unorganized photos, quickly, by date. The best solution so far: 1) Right click on the photo, 2) Click Get Info, 3) Leave the Get Info window up while organizing. This process allows me to click on any image and the Get Into window updates the info instantly.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fm527.png" alt="enter image description here"
