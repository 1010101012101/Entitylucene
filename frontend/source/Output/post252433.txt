How to upgrade system default vim? <body> Finally, vim 8.0 has been released! However, the pre-installed vim is vim 7.3 on my system(OS X El Capitan), and I want to upgrade it to the newest 8.0 version.   So how can I do this without messing things up? Would it be a good idea to simply override the vim in code/usr/bin/vim/code? And what about compiling it from source?  <answer252436> Get the Homebrewsup*/sup package manager.  Install codevim/code formula (as of today it is Vim 8.0.2) with:  precodebrew install vim /code/pre  Check the messages it produced for any manual actions you might be required to perform, although with Vim formula there should be no issues.  One more thing you should do is to check your environment variables for those that might contain a full path to the system codevi/code/codevim/code, like codeEDITOR/code and update them to use the code/usr/local/bin/vim/code.  hr  If you had Homebrew already installed, before running the install command, update the local repository with:  precodebrew update /code/pre  If you had Vim already installed with Homebrew (or if in the future you'd like to upgrade the Vim version), then run:  precodebrew upgrade vim /code/pre  hr  sup*/sup Homebrew is an open-source, actively maintained package manager for Mac OS X. It keeps the packages in code/usr/local/Cellar/code folder by default. It stores links to the executable files code/usr/local/bin/code and puts this directory ahead of system directories in the codePATH/code environment variable. Your code/usr/bin/vim/code can thus be left alone.  Homebrew will also take care of all the paths and dependencies for installed packages.  <comment314114> Basically any command line tool works like http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/93002/how-to-properly-update-git-on-mac or http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/231347/5472
