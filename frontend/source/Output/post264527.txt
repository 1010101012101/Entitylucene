Linux VM installation on MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra 10.12 <body> Using MacBook 13" Retina display with macOS Sierra 10.12.  I already have Boot Camp option along with Windows.   Will it be possible for me to use VM on the same machine for Linux?  <answer264531> I prefer VirtualBox (free), but any works. Some other virtualization software are VMware Fusion for Mac (paid), Parallels Desktop for Mac (paid), QEMU (free, bit more complicated install process, see below). Just make sure you have enough RAM, CPU power, and disk space.  Links for how to install QEMU: Quora (easiest process), The Intobooks, Official QEMU instructions for Mac hosts, and Installing QEMU on OS X.  <comment331538> Do you have enough Ram and disk space to do That? Parallels, VMware, and Virtualbox are available for doing that. <comment331539> Yes @LexS I have enough memory to install I have 256GB, 8 GB RAM, machine is almost new, no much space is used.
