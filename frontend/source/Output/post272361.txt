How to use ImageMagick to bulk crop empty space on png files? <body> I just installed ImageMagick (new to Terminal) and can't figure out how to bulk crop a folder of pngs to remove all transparent space around the png (i.e. a square logo on a rectangle png with transparent area that can be cropped)    I am trying to take all the pngs and output them into a different folder called out.   What is the command?  <answer272362> To trim a single image:  precodeconvert /path/to/original.png -trim +repage /path/to/out/trimmed.png /code/pre  To trim each png in a folder:  precodecd /path/to/folder mkdir ../out for f in ./*.png; do   convert "$f" -trim +repage "../out/$f"; done /code/pre
