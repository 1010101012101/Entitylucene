How can I get old instruments on Garageband so I can play my old files? <body> I made a bunch of songs in Garageband a few years ago, on my old MacBookPro (ended up with Mountain Lion, I believe). When I open them on my new computer (a MacBookAir running Yosemite) some of the instruments (it's usually the drum kits) are not available. It gives me this pop up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zD2Hm.png" alt="missing instrument error message"  How can I get those old instruments so that these old files can be played and edited again?  <answer201515> The 4th column, Purchased. If it is empty that ends that unless you used a different Apple ID.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EeDAq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer201517> Open your new Garageband and then  Garageband menu - Download More Sounds  see if they appear in there.  <comment242259> Have you looked in the App store for the 'old' version of garageband? Should be in your 'purchases.' <comment242830> I didn't purchase Garageband. It came on my computer. (I also made the projects not all from my own computer. Some I made elsewhere and saved them to my computer.) <comment242838> I never specifically bought it(or used it) either, it came with my first macbook, but it shows in my purchases at the apple app store. Just a suggestion. <comment242925> where do you see your purchases? i see past orders (but it's empty)
