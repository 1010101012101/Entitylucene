Undo an autocorrected word on the iPhone keyboard <body> The iPhone's keyboard seems extremely diligent with its autocorrection.  Problem is, I very frequently type words that aren't in the dictionary (proper names, foreign words, etc...).   In some Android keyboards, there is a function to undo a word that was autocorrected to the original spellingâ€”is such a functionality available in iPhone's default keyboard?  <answer265972> There's a pretty simple way to undo any auto-correct on the iPhone's keyboard: if you type a word that autocorrects, just hit the delete key, and a popup of suggestions for that word will pop up. The first suggestion is the word you had before it was autocorrected.   So say you type codethid/code, which autocorrects to codethis/code, but you really meant to type codethid/code.  strongJust type codethid/code, then hit space, then backspace, then a popup with the word codethid/code will appear. Tap it to undo the autocorrection./strong  Here's a video.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J5Y8p.png" alt="Image of undoing autocorrect in Notes"  <comment333500> I saw a couple of related questions on the site but they all seemed to be about non-IPhone keyboard <comment333522> answered both of your questions, let me know if you have any questions and whether they help you or not.
