PHP will not run from command line <body> When trying to run a PHP script from inside Terminal, the script is just echoed to stdout.  This happens if the script is executed directly (first line code#!/usr/bin/php/code) called as an argument (code/usr/bin/php ./test.php/code), or if the php command(s) is input interactively.  What could be the problem?  Computer is El Capitan Server, 10.11.6; and, no extra MAMP/Apache/PHP has been installed.  On a non-server El Capitan machine, things work as expected; so, I'm stumped...

Could the script contain non-ASCII characters or be UTF8+BOM formatted? If so, try [stripping these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3337936/remove-non-ascii-characters-from-csv#3337960) as that could confuse the shell. Unlikely but worth a try. Also does, `/usr/bin/php ` work? <comment327995> Added more info, @GrahamMiln .   I also considered the UTF8 problem, because the original script I was running did have some Japanese comments.  But, as you can see, that's not an issue with the test script.  Running as root, to rule out permissions issues as well... <comment327996> Use "?php\nphpinfo();" instead of your test.php content. "\n" means new line (which I can't express in the comment here). <comment327997> The "?php" long tag did the trick!  Add that as an answer @klanomath , and I'll accept it.
