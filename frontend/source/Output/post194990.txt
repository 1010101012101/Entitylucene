How to back up my text messages from iPhone to computer <body> I have my many precious messages on my iPhone. How can I back up to computer freely without using iTunes?  <answer194993> when connecting your iPhone to your computer, head over to iTunes and make a backup. Make sure you're backup on your computer not on iCloud.

You can export many other files as well, including app data, photos, movies, etc. It can also open iTunes backups to extract files you may have deleted accidentally, mitigating the need to restore the entire backup.   Just a happy customer: I have no financial stake in Macroplant.  <answer235157> PhoneView will do the job for you. There is a free trial so you can see how it works.
