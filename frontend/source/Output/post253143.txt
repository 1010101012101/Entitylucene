Apple soft, ITunes, Eject button <body> The guy who wants to buy my MacBook, while checking it have opened ITunes and kept "Eject" button for a few seconds. Any ideas - why? Any possible danger? Thank you very much in advance.  <comment315025> You're asking if there is any danger to pressing the eject button for a few seconds? If that's all it took to damage a computer, there'd be a lot less working computers. <comment315399> That's what I've thought...
