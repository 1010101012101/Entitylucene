What is the monitor-like icon on Remote App screen? <body> There is a monitor/display like icon at the bottom of the Now Playing screen of the Remote app on iPad. It's just to the right of the genius icon. What is it?  <answer22211> That icon activates the visualiser in iTunes  <comment35341> Just curious, but why didn't you click on it? <comment55634> Clicking the icon has no visible effect on the iPad other than highlighting the icon. I was wondering about this too. I wasn't looking at the Mac's screen.
