Wi-Fi on MacBook Air keeps dropping <body> UPDATE: This topic seems relevant.  On emsome/em certain networks, my MBA randomly disconnects and connects again. It may happen every 5 minutes or so, depending on how much I use the internet (eg. happens a lot when I'm on Youtube).  This is what codewifi.log/code outputs everytime a disconnect occurs:  precodeMon Sep  5 14:46:23.903 &lt;kernel&gt; AirPort_Brcm43xx::syncPowerState: WWEN[disabled] Mon Sep  5 14:46:23.998 &lt;airportd[65]&gt; _handleLinkEvent: Got an error trying to query WiFi for power.

Also I noticed that on emsome/em networks my MacBook Air doesn't disconnect at all.  I tried forgetting the network and re-joining, and also changed the router's channel from 11 to 10.  I'm on OS X 10.11.3  Thanks in advance.  <comment312803> There are only really 3 non-conflicting channels, btw - 1, 6 & 11. if you're going to change, pick the least crowded of those
