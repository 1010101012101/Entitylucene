How do I view which devices are connected to my AirPort Extreme using AirPort Utility v6.0? <body> I recently upgraded to AirPort Utility v6.0, and I can't find where to check what devices are currently connected to my AirPort Extreme. I know that this was possible using older versions of AirPort Utility, and hopefully that feature wasn't removed.  How can I find what devices are connected to my Airport Extreme?  <answer42457> Just click on the AE icon and it will display a list of connected wireless clients.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPz6T.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment48258> Wow, I totally missed that. Thanks! :) <comment62628> It only shows MAC addresses for some devices here, as far as I can see. <comment164262> this only shows wireless clients, which is not what op asked <comment175001> Is there any way to monitor the count of devices? My network is pretty close the 50 device limit...
