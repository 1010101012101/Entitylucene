MacBook Pro suddenly started to freeze with any action (using SSD) <body> I'm having a trouble with my MacBook Pro (Mid 2012).  I have upgraded it (5 months ago) to use a Kingston SSD instead of a SATA, and everything was perfect. Very fast and smooth...until yesterday. I was working and then when it was time to go home, i just pull down the monitor and the macbook went to sleep. When i came home and open my MacBook, it was just a disaster, EVERY SINGLE action, even click on any button, causes to freeze and the apple colorful ball (loading) appears.  Today i tried to put another SSD (samsung) to test if was my SSD that has a problem, but the problem remained. Then i tried to use a simple SATA and everything is normal (i'm asking now from my macbook with a SATA HD).  What do you think it could be?  This are my configs:  - strongMacBook Pro Mid 2012/strong  - strong13"/strong  - strongi7/strong  - strong12Gb RAM/strong  - strongIntel graphics 1024/strong  - strongEl Capitain OS X/strong  p.s.: My SSD is almost full.   <answer222796> It sounds like you have a faulty SATA cable. Others have reported this same problem when upgrading from a standard HD to a SSD with Mid-2012 MacBook Pro laptops.  You can find more information over at Appleâ€™s Support site: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24783957#24783957  <comment269949> Did you happen to recently install the 10.11.2 update for El Capitan? <comment270012> I really dont know if i have updated El Capitan. But lets assume that i have updated. The problem occurs when i use the SSD in my MacBook, i have tested in my friends MacBook (that is late 2012) and works like a charm. <comment270059> I read the discussion and the problem there is that the cable was not recognizing the SSD as a bootable drive. Mine is recognized but after 5 months, it started to freeze when doing any action. <comment332223> @WitaloBenicio It has been sometime. But I was wondering whether you found some solution to this. As I have exactly same problem. <comment332416> @IJR yes, i figured out what as going on. It was a problem with the flex cable of HD
