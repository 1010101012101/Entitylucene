Installing iOS SDK (Xcode) portably? <body> Is there any way to install the entire Xcode and iOS SDK developer suite on an external hard drive, and run it? When I open the .mpkg, I get " codeXcode and iOS SDK can't be installed on this disk. You can only install this software on the disk that is running Mac OS X/code"  Is there a workaround for this? I looked through the package contents, and there's no "RequiresOSXHardDisk" key or anything I can find.  <comment60393> Which version of Xcode are you talking about here? I'm pretty sure the recent versions of Xcode are an app that includes an installer for the extra bits. <comment60422> @StevenFisher I'm trying to to 3.2.6, since I have Snow Leopard and no access to the Mac App Store on this machine.
