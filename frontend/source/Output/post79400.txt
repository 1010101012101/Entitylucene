Network Link Conditioner not working <body> I am a web developer and I recently found out about Network Link Conditioner, but I can't get it to work.  It appears to be working, but when I load anything in a browser, the speed is not changed, regardless of whether or not I use 100% packet loss, etc.   Can anyone tell from this log what might be causing this?   OS 10.7.5, Xcode 4.4.1.   I have tried uninstalling and rebooting in various sequences but no improvement.   Also did the steps here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12414676/network-link-conditioner-seems-to-have-no-effect-on-network-behavior-on-lion-mo  When I switch it on or off, I get this in the Console:  precode1/19/13 3:28:19.142 PM [0x0-0x38038].com.apple.systempreferences: System Preferences(683,0x10e0b1000) malloc: *** auto malloc[683]: error: GC operation on unregistered thread.

This is a legit issue I am having. <comment103813> I get similar errors: OSX 1.7.5 ***  4/12/13 4:19:08.249 PM [0x0-0x1e01e].com.apple.systempreferences: _nlc_start_simulation: (os/kern) failure *** 4/12/13 4:19:08.351 PM [0x0-0x1e01e].com.apple.systempreferences: System Preferences(308,0x1114c5000) malloc: *** auto malloc[308]: error: GC operation on unregistered thread.
