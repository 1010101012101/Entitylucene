Automatic App Installation with iPads <body> Is there a way to push app installations to all the iPads by just installing on one iPad or does this need to be done via Apple Configurator   <comment197842> Apple Configurator is your best bet. You can update it in iTunes and then redistribute it to all the devices. It will ask if you want to overwrite the existing one and you select yes. Or you can create a generic Apple ID provide the login and username to all users and they can do it themselves. <comment197851> So after I prepare I can just use supervisor to push out updates without having to reconfigure/setup ipad without data loss?
