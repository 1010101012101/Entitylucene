Can I install Mac OS X Lion (10.7) on my Windows XP PC? <body> I am using Windows XP, now I want to install Mac OS X Lion (10.7). My problem is I want both operating systems. Is it possible? Will it be possible to use Mac OS X Lion (10.7) and XP simultaneously?  <answer52410> Questions that detail how to actually installation of OS X on non-Apple hardware are off topic due to the strongviolation of the Apple EULA/strong, but let's see if we can have a good general discussion of the issues and assume everyone is here to learn where the virtualization issues lie.   h2Using non-Apple hardware/h2  Your only option is a stronghackint0sh/strong.  h2Using a Mac computer/h2  If you were using a Mac computer, you can use both operating systems:  ul listrongsimultaneously/strong:   OS X (host), XP (virtual machine)/li listrongdual boot/strong via bootcamp:  OS X, XP &#x2190; this will allow XP full access to the hardware  strongNote:/strong  ul liBootcamp in Lion does not support Windows XP. br(Thanks to @DanBarrett for mentioning this)/li /ul  It only supports:  ul liMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium, Microsoft Windows 7 Professional, or Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate with Boot Camp 4.0.

You can download and install VirtualBox. It will emulate the Mac OS X hardware and you can run Mac OS X on your Windows (this tutorial mentions Snow Leopard, but Lion will work as well).br It isn't easy (or recommended...) but this solution is pretty close to the answer you are looking for.   strongPlease note, although they say you can download a copy of Snow Leopard/Lion, this is illegal.

It's easy, quick, and you can get a Mac OS X running within minutes.  <comment59959> I think it's also possible to use XP as a host via bootcamp and virtualize OSX. <comment59960> Keep in mind though that using a virtualization of OSX on a PC still is a **violation of the Apple EULA**. <comment59961> Hm, I thought so... Does this make my answer unsuitable for this site? I'll edit my answer. Thanks! <comment59962> As long as you yourself don't give directions on how to do this, you should be fine - I think... :) <comment59963> I see :-) I'll edit my answer! <comment59965> Questions about installing Mac OS X on non-Apple hardware are off-topic for this site as per the [FAQ]. <comment59988> He wants to install Lion, so XP in Bootcamp isn't an option since Lion Bootcamp only supports Windows 7. <comment59989> @DanBarrett All right, thanks! I wasn't aware of that. <comment60004> Better idea:  Buy a Mac.  Install VM s/w such as VMWare or Parallels.  Then install WinXP (or Win7) in the VM.  Then you can use them simultaneously and be legal at the same time. <comment60031> Yes you certainly can do it, but in many cases, you might not want to risk the licensing issues if you don't have a legal team to know the risks of a potential violation. As long as we can keep this objective and informative, I don't see this needing to be closed. If it gets into a "how to accomplish this" we may need to edit or close this. We're happy to host a high level summary of issues, but **we are not the place to find a "how to run Lion on non-Apple hardware"**. <comment60032> However, we can use a russian doll metaphor to boot Windows 7 in BootCamp and then virtualize an XP instance in that to avoid any Mac OS. It's a stretch if the OP would accept it, but it's certainly possible and clearly within EULA of Windows and Apple if proper licenses are used. <comment60035> Great discussion - trying to be clear of legality and just covering the bases seems a good thing to have. I'll ping another moderator to be sure we're in the clear here. <comment60040> Ok, thanks for the extra pair of eyes. Please notify me if things are illegal, so I can edit my answer
