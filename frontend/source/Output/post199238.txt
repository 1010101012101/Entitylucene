Enable guest user and location services with profile manager <body> Is there a way to enable the guest account and location services with profile manager via built in setting or custom ad on?  <answer218241> Yes. Look for the "Login Window" option in Profile Manager.  <comment264242> I looked for that option. Does not seem to be there. Running Latest version of 10.10. I see login items but there is no option under those settings
