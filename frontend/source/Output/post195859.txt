Weird iMessage behavior on Yosemite <body> Something weird is happening with iMessage on my Mac. I can send and receive messages fine but when I close iMessage and reopen it, all my messages disappear. Also, if the app is closed and I get a message, I get a notification but when I open the app it's not there.  The conversations are all there but they are empty.  What I've tried so far:   ol liSigned out of my account, closed iMessage and restarted the computer.  /li liDeleted all plists related to iMessage in code~/Library/Preferences/code  /li liDelete code~/Library/IdentityServices/code/li /ol  What else should I try?  <answer196411> emThis assumes the storage in your user account is to blame, there could be other reasons./em  Log into the affected account. Ensure codeMessages.app/code is not running by quitting it from the codeMessages/code menu.  Activate codeFinder/code, select codeHome/code from the codeGo/code menu, select codeGet Info/code from the codeFile/code menu. Click the disclosure triangle next to codeSharing &amp; Permissions/code if it isn't already pointing down.  Ensure the single head icon shows your account name and "code(me)/code".  Unlock the box at the bottom right, then click the action button (looks like a gear) and choose codeApply to enclosed items/code. When it warns that it can't be undone, click Ok.  <answer196798> First make sure the "Save history when conversations are closed" is checked in "Preferences--General" to have an archive of conversations in the future.  Second the Messages.app history and archives are saved to a couple locations in Yosemite.  precode~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/ ~/Library/Messages/ /code/pre  Backup the files in the folder ~/Library/Messages/ and save to a separate location to have a backup of your previous messages.(if they exist)  Then remove both the files in above paths:  precoderm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.iChat/Data/Library/Messages/* rm -rf ~/Library/Messages /code/pre  Restart Messages.app and the below message will appear that it is rebuilding your Messages database.  The couple times a have done this it resulted in having to just restart the machine as I didn't want to wait.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xsTai.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just remember to make a backup of any files you delete as they hold archives of previous conversations.  <comment234418> Try setting up the account again in a new user account as a test. <comment234452> Since when did this behaviour occur? Did you recover from a TimeMachine backup? Have you tried do use Disk Utility to fix permissions? <comment234464> No, I didn't recover from a TimeMachine backup or used Disk Utility. <comment234948> I've tried doing that and the problem is still there. Thanks. <comment235143> I've created a new user account and tested it, it works fine. Now what? How can I get it to work in my account? <comment235359> Sadly that also didn't solve it. I returned to the same [empty conversations view](https://www.dropbox.com/s/23k5xaeumo5gdlu/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-22%20at%2010.06.27%20AM.png?dl=0). How is it retaining the conversations after all archives have been removed? <comment235515> Do you have any other devices that are signed in to iMessage with the same Apple ID? <comment235528> I am having the same issue since July 12. I was making some updates and downloading files larger than my disk space allowed. I briefly saw a pop-up telling me that it may affect the message database, but dismissed as I was deleting other files to make some space. Since then, no newer archives have been created. Re: tron_jones reply, I have tried the process, but even after restarting the Mac, i cannot empty the trash as the .db files seem to be in use :( <comment235559> Yes, I do have an iPod Touch, an iPad and an iPhone all signed in using the same Apple ID with iMessage working fine. <comment235618> So for some reason I don't understand, iMessage started working again normally after my computer kernel panicked and restarted. I believe that clearing that archive followed by a restart was what it needed. I'm accepting your answer as it's _probably_ what fixed the problem.
