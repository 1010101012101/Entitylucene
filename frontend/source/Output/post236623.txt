How to create an ad hoc Wi-Fi network in OS X? <body> I came across a problem today  when there was a speaker in my class. The speaker was from the industry and had a company provided laptop which was not able to get connected to University network (some other problem which I had to raise in another question).   As a solution to the problem, I thought I would create the public Wi-Fi, using my MacBook Pro, without a password so that he can get connected directly. However I am a little embarrassed in not finding a option do so. Can anyone give me some solution if one exists.  <answer236631> A solution does in fact exist. Click the Wi-Fi symbol in the menu bar and choose Create Network.  <answer236801> @Nikita was half right before you do that though giro Settings.appsharinginternet sharing then select what you want to be shared and where it will be shared then create wifi network codemeow /code  <comment289598> http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-set-up-an-ad-hoc-wireless-network.html  Hint: use Google with "os x create ad hoc network" <comment289803> Thanks for the answer. I have used that and had created one. _Unfortunately_ it doesn't offer the Internet.  As far I have learned its for your iPhone to be sync-ed over the wifi. I will be more than glad if it works as an access point for other devices to Internet. But I believe its not. <comment289893> Sorry I missed the point of you question. After you've created your public Wi-Fi spot that way you need another means of connecting to the Uni network since you can't redistribute your Wi-Fi connection via the same Wi-Fi connection. So you're going to connect to the Uni network with an Ethernet cable at which point you might as well connect it directly to the provided laptop. I guess you could redistribute your Wi-Fi connection over Bluetooth and connect the laptop that way. Check what's available for you in the `Sharing` preference pane.
