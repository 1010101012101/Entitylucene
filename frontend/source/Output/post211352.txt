Changing Input Language in iOS 9 with External Keyboard <body> When using an external keyboard, is there a new key combination to change the input language? It used to be kbd⌘-cmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd, but since iOS 9 that combination has been assigned to Spotlight Search, same as OS X.  My external keyboard has a kbd/kbd key that also invokes Spotlight Search starting with iOS 9, since I suppose it's a simple macro for kbd⌘-cmd/kbd+kbdspace/kbd.  <answer211353> Found it: it's now kbd^ctrl/kbd+kbdspace/kbd. I think that's the same as on OS X now.  <comment255387> Yes, it's same as the default for OS X starting with El Capitan.  But there of course you can change it via system prefs if you want.
