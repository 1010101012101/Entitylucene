Apple Mail - Is it possible to always display images for specific addresses only <body> In Preferences - Viewing you can select to uncheck the option  "emLoad remote content in messages/em"  This results in email with rich content displayed without images (since they are remotely loaded).   Although in general I want to keep this option as a good privacy measure, would it be possible to make exceptions for specific senders? Something along the lines of the option that Gmail has:   "emAlways display images for user@company.com/em"  <comment354778> This question comes up semi-regularly, but sadly I don't think there is a way to do this in Apple's **Mail** apps. Do note that on the Mac, **Mail** does *not* load remote images for messages deteced as Junk. On iOS, as long as you do not *Push* messages from the Junk folder, then you won't load their remote images either.
