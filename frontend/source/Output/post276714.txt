iTerm2 - Disable same commands across tabs <body> Terminal app in Sierra keeps crashing so I switched to iTerm. But iTerm tabs behave weirdly. Whatever I do in one tab automatically replicates across all open tabs! Am I missing some setting to turn this off? Please help.   Attached a gif showing that I open 1 file in tab 3, upon switching to tabs 1, 2 I see the same file open.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TxtTE.gif" alt="enter image description here"   <answer276716> In the Menu: Shell  Broadcast Input  Send Input to Current Session Only  <comment348320> this setting is what is selected. please see my screenshot https://i.stack.imgur.com/6lVp4.jpg. In Spite of this setting being "send input to current session only" I see this behavior. Please advise. <comment348351> Whai if you select Send to all sessions and then rollback to Current Session Only?
