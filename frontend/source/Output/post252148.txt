Finder - No Services Apply <body> I have services set up, particularly the one for opening Terminal from a folder.  However, it doesn't appear in the context menu and in Finder  Services, there is nothing except "No services apply"    I'm using El Capitan 10.11.6   Anyone else have this problem?  <answer252194> You have to click on a file or folder to select it and then the Services menu will work. You can get to the Services from either the Finder menu bar or by Control-clicking (right-clicking) on an item.  <comment313691> Have you checked "System Preferences - Keyboard - Services" this ist the part that you can enable shortcuts from the context menu. <comment313698> I my option, this type of service would not appear on the menu bar. So "No services apply" is probably correct. Try right clicking on the folder in a Finder window and looking there for the service. <comment314167> Ahh, this does work for folders, but not in column view.  However, it will only work from the menu bar along the top.  The directions I was following say that I can have access by right clicking inside a folder and opening up terminal from the context menu. <comment316934> According to tutorials I've followed, it should be a context menu option in every folder
