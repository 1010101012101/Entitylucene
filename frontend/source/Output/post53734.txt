How do I prevent X11 opening an xterm when it starts? <body> When I start the X11.app then it launches an xterm automatically.  I've long since switched from the "ordinary" xterm to rxvt-unicode so the initial xterm just hangs around like a wallflower never being used.  Whilst it's not particularly embad/em, it spoils the look of the place so I'd like to stop it launching.  How do I do it?  <answer53737> precodedefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 app_to_run /usr/bin/true /code/pre  in a Terminal. However, note that there really shouldn't be necessary to every start XQuartz.app (or X11.app; see the comments) manually. It will start automatically when you run an X11 client, and then it will not start its defaults startup application.  <answer183267> Since I'm not at my OSX computer right now, I'll give you the fail-proof answer for this. 'true' does nothing and exits successfully, so I set that to run at startup.  Apple's old X11:br/codedefaults write org.x.X11 app_to_run $(which true)/code  and for XQuartz:br/codedefaults write org.macosforge.xquartz.X11 app_to_run $(which true)/code  and for MacPorts X11.app:br/codedefaults write org.macports.X11 app_to_run $(which true)/code  In case you are wondering, code$(which true)/code will make a line read, for example,br/codedefaults write org.x.X11 app_to_run /bin/true/code.br/I write it as code$(which true)/code because I am not at my mac and do not remember if it is in /bin/true or some other location.  I have additionally read that you can set these to code''/code (that's two single quotes, so nothing at all), and it will do the same thing. I have not tried it, though.

Use [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) for all your X11 needs on the mac. That said, I think X11.app has the same defaults setting, but I don't remember the name of the preferences file. Look for it in Library/Preferences/. <comment61490> Last time I used Mac OS X then XQuartz wasn't around so I hadn't heard of that - any other things like that I should know about?  For X11 it's `org.x.X11`, and I set the value to `''` which seemed to work as well as `/usr/bin/true`. <comment61492> Hmm. No, I can't think of anything other than X11/XQuartz with that particular peculiarity. Though I remain forever confused about whether I should get my Java updates from Apple or Oracle these days. <comment217399> if you use fink, packages are not built for Xquartz on 10.6. so your suggestion is invalid, harald. <comment217514> @Wyatt8740 I'll take your word for it. I don't have any suggestions for what to do in that case. If you do find out, feel free to add your own answer or comment. (Or if you need the answer but don't know how, ask a new question.) <comment218424> @HaraldHanche-Olsen I have the answer, but the truth is that some people don't have the choice to use quartz :( <comment349404> So is there still some kind of .xinitrc or xinit application?  I'm bugged by the foxtrotting xterm but it's easy to imagine a situation in which I'd want to run multiple 'something elses.'  Should I defaults write ~/myxinitrc.sh or is XQuartz still looking for a fixed file name? <comment349448> @AndrewWolfe I am getting a bit rusty here, so take this with a grain of salt. XQuartz will run `xinit` on startup. And that runs the shell script `/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc`, which in turn runs scripts in `/usr/X11/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/`. In there, you find `98-user.sh`, which will run all executable shell scripts in `~/.xinitrc.d/` with names ending in `.sh`. Note that you can short circuit this by having one of the latter shell scripts `exec` your desired window manager. Then the default `xterm` is not run. <comment349450> â€¦ and all of that (previous comment) means that I am not sure my answer, now almost five years old, is still valid. <comment349468> Thanks, @HaraldHanche-Olsen I'm checking it out...
