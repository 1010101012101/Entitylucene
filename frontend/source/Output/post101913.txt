How to rotate screens separately? <body> Is there a way to rotate an external screen separately and keep the orientation of the inbuilt display fixed?  Using OS X 10.8.5  <answer101914> Yes, you should be able to orient each screen separately. In fact, here is a link of that very thing being done.  To access the screen rotation option in OS X:  ol liLaunch strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liHold down kbd⌘ cmd/kbd + kbd⌥ alt/option/kbd and click strongDisplays/strong.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l5tz4.png" height="70"/li liOn the right side of the Display Preferences, look for the strongRotation/strong drop down menu./li liSet the rotation you want.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywV7g.png" width="350"/li liConfirm the change and quit System Preferences. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0eLoo.png" width="350"/li /ol  <comment120084> Thanks for your help, I just tried this, but it seems this way I will always rotate both the external and the internal screen simultaneously ! I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, using the drop down for the external screen will automatically make the same change to the respective drop down for my internal screen .... <comment120094> Thanks again, got it. For some reason it just always decided to swap to mirroring automatically... <comment228662> Do NOT rotate your screen using command-alt-click on the Display preference pane. http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104832/55028
