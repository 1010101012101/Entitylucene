How can I remove an icon from dock in ML? <body> In previous releases of OS X, you were able to remove an icon from the dock by just dragging it off. However, this does not seem to work anymore.  strongHow can I remove a program's icon from the dock?/strong  <answer57523> This is actually still possible; however, a safe-guard to protect novice users has been added. There is now a minimum distance that you need to move the icon away from the Dock for it to be removed.  Once that distance is reached, the cursor will show a wrinkled paper icon.  Simply release the mouse then, and the icon will be removed from the dock normally.  Alternatively, one can still use the context menu of the icon (right-click or long-left-click the icon to make it appear) and go to emOptions  Remove from Dock/em.
