Replacing a macbook air 2016 I/O Board and Flex Cable <body> I am trying to find a replacement part for my macbook air 2016 (model-A1466) I/O board and flex cable. The cable has a part number printed on it:br 821-1722-Abr C-{4 digits which I can't remember}brbr  I found a replacement part with the same product number, but the 4 digits on the second line are different.   Does that matter or do I need an EXACT match?  <answer277700> According to this iFixit product page the part number for this part doesn't seem to include the codeC-XXXX/code portion as they only have code821-1722-A/code listed in the part number. I also find it useful to use their Identify your Mac feature when I'm looking for parts. Good luck!
