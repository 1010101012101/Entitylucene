iMessage / Facetime not activating phone number ios8 iPhone 6+ <body> iMessage and Facetime are not activating on my iPhone 6plus, using my phone number (only appleid). ios 8 and now ios 8.02.   I have reset, restored, airplane mode, date and time, on/ off, country, phone number in phone showing, backed up, not backed up, tried another sim (Telstra), dfu, icloud, apple account with phone number through web, absolutely everything  including waiting 24 hours.   Rung Telstra and Apple twice to no avail, visited Apple, DFU restored there again, no avail, went to Telstra shop and no luck...even watched whilst the tech activated iMessage and Facetime WITH phone number successfully on two demo models with his id.   Anyone else or am I to be restricted to the land of sms only or iMessage with email only?
