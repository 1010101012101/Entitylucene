How to isolate apps from the internet? <body> Can I completely isolate apps on mac from the internet, without installing any additional software ?  I need a sort of firewall to isolate them thanks  <answer104361> No, you can't without additional software. The only solution would be to cut the Internet connexion of your computer.  You can block incoming connexions though, using the standard Mac OS X Firewall (accessible in the Security &amp; Privacy panel of the System Preferences). When activated, when an application wants to start listening on a certain port, you are prompted to allow or deny the listening.  With additional software, you can use the excellent Little Snitch application that allows blocking outgoing connexions as well.
