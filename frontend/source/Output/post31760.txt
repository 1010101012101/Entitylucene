Spotlight can't see renamed label in Lion <body> Spotlight has an operator, code-label/code, that lets you search for files with a certain color label applied (e.g. Red, Green.) A dropdown auto-populates with label colors when you type the operator into a Finder window find box.  I have renamed a label ("Red" to "Followup"), and it no longer appears as an option in that dropdown. I've run codemdutil -E //code to rebuild my Spotlight index, but no luck.  I'm running OS X Lion (10.7.2), though I just started using labels, so this may go back a ways. (An aside: in my research it seems there's a strange mixing of Spotlight operators in the form code-&lt;operator&gt;/code and code&lt;operator&gt;:/code.)  Ideas?  <answer33663> It's a little convoluted, but I've found a workaround. The renamed label is still not appearing with the code-label/code operator autocomplete, but you can search for it another way.  ol liIn a Finder window, choose File  Find/li liIn the criterion dropdown (defaults to "Kind"), select Other... and enable File Label/li liSelect the File Label criterion and all the colors will be available/li /ol
