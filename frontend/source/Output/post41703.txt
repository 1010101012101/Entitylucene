iWork '09 Numbers: How to set the default language of the document <body> I would like to set the default language of a Numbers document. I figured out how to do it for a Pages document: How Do I Set the Default Language in Pages? but I cannot find the corresponding inspector tab in Numbers.  How can I set the default language of the Numbers document to e.g. German?

As of iWork '09 the used language follows the set language defined under emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Language &amp; Text/em.  However, you can start applications in a custom language via strongLanguage Switcher/strong (works in Lion). But even with this tool you cannot set the language in which an applications starts permanently. You have to start it via Language Switcher emevery time/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ilxf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment47345> Thanks for the a dive. However, to set the language to the whole sheet (selecting with Cmd A), it seems that the sheet must be empty. Otherwise, it jumps to the first word and it is necessary to do the spell check word by word...
