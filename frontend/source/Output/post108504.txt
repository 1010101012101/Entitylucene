How to change lower case am/pm on the menu bar to uppercase? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ho9Oj.png" alt="enter image description here"  I find the time shown on the menu bar on mavericks a bit annoying. It's not perfect. The "AM/PM" is now shown in lowercase after upgrade to OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Back in the previous versions of OS X, it was displayed in uppercase.   strongIs there a way change the lowercase am/pm to uppercase/strong?  <answer108516> Go into System Preferences - Language &amp; region, click on the button labeled "Advancedâ€¦"  in the lower right, select the tab labeled "Times" and and then enter AM / PM as the abbreviations for Before / After noon in the lower left text fields.  <answer108518> Since my system is german, I'm not 100% sure, but try this:  ul ligo to 'Language &amp; Region' in the System Preferences/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cPUKh.png" alt="Language &amp; Region"  ul liopen 'Advanced Options'/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CwpMS.png" alt="Advanced Options"  ul ligo to tab 'Time' and see if you can customize the way it's displayed/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HJrZx.png" alt="enter image description here"
