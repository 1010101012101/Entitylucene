Safari can't verify the identity of the website errors <body> Well, I did a bit of searching before I decided to post here. I've been getting this message for the past month whenever I visit one of two sites. Both sites are professional companies that sell products in the audio community, but only two website are flagging these errors.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/06sxM.jpg" alt="Safari error message certificate"  The issue spans across all browsers (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox), each of these three throw the error that's similar.  I've already rechecked the automatic date/time update in date and time preferences and I've already used the keychain repair. Both of those were some of the top rated fixes, but neither fixed it for me. I've read that sometimes deleting certain certificates in keychain can fix the issue, but I'm not too savvy with the inner workings of the web and wasn't entirely sure what I was supposed to be doing.   Can anyone suggest any other ways to fix the issue?  It spans multiple browsers and both sites have valid certificates (I work for one of the companies that I'm having issues with), so it's on my end.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

As a result the certification chain is incomplete and the intermediate certification authority emthawte DV SSL SHA256 CA/em can't be verified.  To restore the default content of /System/Library/Keychains download the OS X 10.8.5 Combo Updater. You may either install it or extract the files. If you have reasons not to update to 10.8.5, additionally download and install Pacifist. Open the image OSXUpdCombo10.8.5.dmg. In the mounted image open the file OSXUpdCombo10.8.5.pkg with Pacifist. Then install them by choosing the three files in the keychain folder and hitting Install (red circle).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jFlLd.jpg" alt="Pacifist opening installer package"  You need admin privileges to do so.  hr  This might not solve your problems immediately but you got all the Thawte certificates back and start over resolving your issue.  Additionally I advice to update to OS X 10.8.5 and install any supplemental updates for 10.8.5 and the newest security updates: Security Update 2015-006 Mountain Lion.  <comment270125> Haven't tried this one yet:  http://b.rthr.me/wp/2012/07/a-fix-for-ssl-certificate-problems-on-mac-osx-lion/ <comment270131> Please open Keychain Access -  Keychains - System Roots and check if it contains the root cert: **thawte Primary Root CA - G3** <comment270132> Well, unfortunately, I have no Thawte's at all in System Roots, I actually removed all of them earlier before this post to see if the certs would regenerate and fix the issue (again, I dont know much in this field, pardon anything that sounds like I don't know what I'm talking about, because I dont).  I also ran some anti virus software to make sure I wasn't compromised.  I don't know if this will ever be solved, been working on my own on it for a few months now :( <comment270133> Also ran Key First Aid and fixed the issues there. <comment270253> Actually, after a restart, I think the issue may be gone!  A few websites working now! Fingers crossed. <comment270254> @joe_04_04 Please remove all above comments except one or two. The system doesn't like them that much. <comment270259> @joe_04_04 This is no solution. That's more or less a [MITM-attack](http://www.thesafemac.com/avasts-man-in-the-middle/). Where does this come from? Did you install Avast? <comment270260> I have no idea where it came from, I noticed it a month or two back but didn't think anything of it, thought it was an issue on the site's end.  I'm a very careful person when it comes to the web, I guess not careful enough.  I installed avast last night and ran it and it came back with zero infections.  Any other steps I should be taking?  I'm a bit worried again.
