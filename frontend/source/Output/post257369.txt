Command+Tab between apps does not work in Sierra <body> Since updating to macOS Sierra, many apps fail to respond correctly to Command+Tab switching.  For example, if the three most recent apps are any two other apps A and B and C, in the order A B C, Command+Tab from A briefly shows B, and then immediately switches to C.   Examples of B that exhibit this behavior include non-Apple apps (e.g. TextWrangler) as well as Apple apps (e.g. Messenger). Changing at least some apps to full screen causes them to behave correctly.  hr  "Manually" switching by holding Command+Tab and selecting B fails in the same way.   <comment321336> I cannot reproduce the behavior you've described, so the only thing I can offer is to suggest submitting feedback and or a bug report. See http://www.apple.com/feedback/macosx.html & https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/ <comment326626> I can reproduce this; 1) Open Chrome and Terminal.  2) Close both application windows and leave both apps open in the background.  3) Open Chrome 4) Put Chrome in Full Screen Mode 5) Use Command+Tab to select Terminal 6) You'll be returned to the first desktop space and Finder will be in focus, requiring you to use Command+Tab again to use the Terminal.   I fully agree this is a bug.
