Pasteboard doesn't work, because it failed to allocate result <body> My copy-paste functionality stopped working  and it happens each time around a week after each restart.  In logs I see the following errors while hitting kbdCMD/kbd-kbdC/kbd:     Failed to allocate result      Failed to copy pasteboard name bytes to shared memory      Lock timeout allocation (alloc lock)   Screenshot from emConsole/em app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EAyOn.png" alt="Failed to allocate result, Failed to copy pasteboard name bytes to shared memory"  If I try to copy and paste in newly opened emTerminal/em, the same errors happens for that app. Basically half of the apps which I'm using are affected.  I've tried to restart codepboard/code service, but without success:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.pboard launchctl start com.apple.pboard /code/pre  Although using codepbcopy/code and codepbpaste/code from CLI works fine (but not outside of the command-line):  precode$ echo test | pbcopy $ pbpaste test /code/pre  So despite codepbpaste/code having the text stored correctly, hitting kbdCMD/kbd-kbdV/kbd doesn't work at all. Usually it removes the selected text with nothing.  Details:  ul liI've 16GB RAM, 50GB free on HD./li liRunning codememory_pressure/code shows 35% system-wide free memory./li liRunning codetop/code shows: 15G used, 603M unused./li liThis happens for every app (e.g. emTerminal/em, emChrome/em, emFinder/em, etc.)./li liHitting kbdCMD/kbd-kbdX/kbd removes the text, but pasting generates chime sound (indicating that the pboard is empty)./li liDrag &amp; drop in Finder isn't working as well, generating the same emallocation result/em error, however restarting service solves the drag &amp; drop problem, but still not copy and paste functionality:  precodelaunchctl stop com.apple.Finder launchctl start com.apple.Finder /code/pre/li liEverything else is works fine./li liRestart helps only for couple of days or a week, until the same would happen again./li liIt doesn't work for: Chrome, Terminal, Term2, Messages, Spotlight Search/li liIt does work for: Safari, Opera, Console, TextEdit, Contacts/li /ul  I'm not sure why macOS cannot allocate shared memory, since it has plenty of it. Any way to free or allocate more of it manually?  Any ideas how to fix this problem without restarting a system?  hr  More details:  ul liemiStat Menus/em memory report  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6QA4xm.png" alt="iStat"/li /ul
