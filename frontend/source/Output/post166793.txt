How can I eliminate this repeated Java Runtime Environment (JRE) pop-up window? <body> This window has been popping up repeatedly:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WfREO.png" alt="repeated"  I was sure that I already had the latest version of Java installed, but to verify I went here: https://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp  And sure enough I have the latest JRE. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QM3YI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then I went and followed the directions here to find the JRE via my command line: https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml#cmdline which says to enter:      $ /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin/java -version   and the terminal output was:     java version "1.8.0_25"   Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_25-b17)   Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.25-b02, mixed mode)`   Can anyone help me identify what I'm doing wrong here?  I definitely have Java.  <answer170452> I installed the Java Developer Kit and that fixed the problem. I'm not sure why that was needed.  <comment195563> the command to find JRE in termianl is just "java version" <comment195579> It is `java -version` you need a space and a `-` <comment195580> right. `$java -version`... the output was: `No Java runtime present, requesting install.` <comment195586> Would the problem simply be that I don't have the Java Developer Kit?
