How to recover unallocated space on a flash drive? <body> Through a few formatting between Windows, Linux, and MacOS, my flash drive lost about 1GB or so. I only have access to MacOS Sierra now, is there a way that I can recover the unallocated space?  *The unallocated space does not show up in codediskutil list/code (terminal)  <comment367687> Are you sure that it's not just the GibiByte (1.07x10^9 B) vs GigaByte (1x10^9 B) thing? Please add the output of `sudo gpt -r show diskX` (entered in Terminal) with X the disk identifier of the flash drive (probably 1 or 2 - check this with `diskutil list`)? <comment367805> @klanomath I will give it a try next time I have similar problem. I already found a windows OS to repartition the disk and now I got the space back. <comment367822> Unallocated disk space never shows up in `diskutil list`. It's simply (size_diskX - âˆ‘ size_diskXsN) and you have to calculate it yourself <comment367824> @klanomath it was the hidden unalloc space that doesn't show up in diskX either. I think Unix might not be able to read at all, but there was a guy on Apple forum provided a method. I didn't try since I recovered the disk with a Windows already.
