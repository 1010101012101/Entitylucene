Keyboard shortcuts for switching Spaces? <body> I have a laptop and a desktop both running 10.11.1; on the laptop I found a way to set up Spaces so that CTRL-1 would take me immediately to screen 1 and similarly for all the other screens.  I rely on that convenience.  But on my desktop I am still stuck with this stupid Mission Control 2-step procedure.  I KNOW it's possible, but I have been unable to reproduce this convenience on the desktop.  Can anyone remind me how it's done?    <answer213551> Troubleshooting possibilities, assuming everything already emlooks/em OK re JM's answer...  ul liOn a keyboard with a 10-key pad, the 10-key &amp; qwerty numbers are separate controls. The default key commands use qwerty so you need to change them specifically to 10-key if that's what you use. /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BmQOm.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J7UTX.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSecondly, though the commands are added with each new Space, they are not enabled by default. /li liThirdly - if you have only the same number of Spaces as you have monitors - strongand also/strong "Displays have separate Spaces" in Prefs  Mission Control - then Switching cannot work until you add one more Space/li liAnother possibility, courtesy of Avram [which I cannot test as I don't have anything to 'swipe' on]       I believe this state occurs when you inadvertently make a swipe gesture while a ctrl-key is held down. I can't be sure of that, but the fix is to do exactly that: hold down the ctrl-key, and then do the desktop-switching swipe gesture (for me it is 3-finger swipe left or right). /li /ul  <answer213566> You can enable this feature in the "Keyboard" preference pane.  ol liOpen System Preferences (e.g., from the Apple menu)/li liClick on the "Keyboard" preference pane/li liGo to the "Shortcuts" tab/li liChoose "Mission Control" from the menu on the left/li liLook in the box on the right for "Switch to Desktop 1"/li liEnable the feature by "checking" the check box/li liBe sure that the keyboard shortcut is "^1" ("^" means Control)/li /ol  If you only have one desktop right now, then you will only see "Switch to Desktop 1", but by placing a checkmark in the box, the feature will be enabled as you add new desktops.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqiwn.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219277> Here's another approach you may find useful; it's been my favorite for years, as it makes for an easy reach, one-handed keyboard shortcut (hotkey trick), to switch between spaces/desktops: strongAlt. + Arrow key/strong     Starting from the second screenshot above (or below depending how the post is uploaded) of the System Preference window for Keyboard: strong1/strong) Select Shortcuts, then strong2/strong) Notice just below the "Keyboard Text Shortcuts Input Sources" menu, that it reads: To change a shortcut, select it, click the key combination, and then type the new keys. strong3/strong) Select "Move left a Space" / "Move right a Space" strong4/strong) Click/tap on the default symbols (i.e., the default shortcut that requires two hands) Ctrl + Arrow, and simply type in "Alt + Arrow" and viola = a one handed keyboard shortcut to switch between spaces.  I realize, a three finger swipe on the trackpad works too, and I love the trackpad, but I prefer keyboard shortcuts where they can be created/applied.  Lastly, I believe this will work on all Apple keyboards, laptop and desktops alike, at least it has on all five in our house (2 MBooks, 1 Air, 2 iMacs).  <answer265800> Went hunting for this myself today, looks like kbdcontrol/kbdkbd ◀/kbd and kbdcontrol/kbdkbd▶/kbd do the job.  <comment257811> It's still the same as this.....http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120012/mavericks-update-broke-keyboard-shortcut-for-switching-spaces/120013#120013 <comment363668> Great answer.  Note that `click the key combination` means double-clicking on the displayed key combo (e.g., `^-`) after it has been selected with the checkbox. Thanks!
