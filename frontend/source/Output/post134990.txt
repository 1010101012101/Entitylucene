What is the easiest way to play webm in Safari? Perian doesn't work <body> I want to play webm in my website but I don't know why it doesn't play. I installed Perian and ffmpeg but none helps. Is there any simple pluging/codec as the one existing for IE? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GGTsQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Well it actually plays the sound I don't hear anything! While I hear it in other browsers. I also tried the following code but yet I can't hear the audio in Safari https://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/detail?name=WebM%20Component%20Installer.pkg  <comment165846> Did you also try [newer forks of Perian](https://github.com/MaddTheSane/perian)?
