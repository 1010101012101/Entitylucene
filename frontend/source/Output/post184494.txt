Mac - switch all desktops at once <body> I can use kbd Ctrl âŒƒ /kbd  and the left/right arrows to switch individual desktops on a multiscreen system but can you switch strongall/strong of them at once?  <answer184496> Only by disabling "Displays have separate Spaces"  System Prefs  Mission Control  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cbVl1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment218763> Bit of a shame but it feels like a feature when I disable it! <comment218765> tbh, It drove me mad for one whole day when it was first introduced, in, I think, Mavericks. It's been off ever since.
