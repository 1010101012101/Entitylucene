Migration Assistant move from Yosemite to Sierra: keyboard and trackpad behaviour different when using Microsoft Remote Desktop <body> I've done a Migration Assistant move of my apps/data/settings from a Yosemite machine to a Sierra machine.  After that I verified that all my "System Preferences" keyboard shortcut settings and trackpad settings had been copied over (they are; I had disabled most of them so Microsoft Remote Desktop gets all keys and mouse events)  On the Sierra machine, somehow these are note forwarded correctly:  ul liOption-Space/li liSecondary-Click/li /ul  With "Yosemite", both will get you the Windows "right mouse button" behaviour (firing up the context menu).  On "Sierra", this the resulting behaviour  ul liOption-Space will get a blank space/li liSecondary-Click will paste the clipboard/li /ul  How can I force Sierra to forward them as-sis to the Microsoft Remote Desktop session?  I'm using a "US" keyboard on both Yosemite and Sierra.  I've reproduced this issue with:  ul liMicrosoft Remote Desktop.8.0.23/li liMicrosoft Remote Desktop.8.0.26/li liMicrosoft Remote Desktop.8.0.29/li liMicrosoft Remote Desktop.8.0.35/li liMicrosoft Remote Desktop.8.0.36/li /ul  <answer268384> It might be worth trying the latest RDC 8.2 beta from Technet :Remote Desktop Client Preview for Mac supports multiple monitors and more   Even though it is still a beta, it offers several significant improvements over the existing release version. I've been using it for months without seeing any real issues.

Does it automagically recognise the remote desktop connections I've setup in 8.0.x? If not: can it import them? <comment336926> tbh, I've been using it so long I don't remember how I loaded mine, whether it was automagic or not, but it can import old files for sure. <comment336933> where does the new version store the settings? (so I can try to see where I can hunt down the settings for the old version). <comment336939> I think you need to export them - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182209/where-does-microsoft-rdp-8-for-mac-store-its-configuration <comment337172> I verified with Remote Desktop Beta and still have the same problems. <comment337174> Sorry, I've no better idea. I haven't gone to Sierra yet. <comment337244> No problem. Any other ideas of apps I could test option key shortcuts with? <comment337745> I've verified with VMware Fusion: right click also does a paste, but option-space key does get through.
