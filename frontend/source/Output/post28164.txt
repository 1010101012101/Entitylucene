Keyboard shortcut to sleep a Mac <body> I am looking for a quick way to sleep without closing the lid, or using the mouse.  If it matters, I have Lion version OS and a MacBook Air.   <answer28165> Press the power button. Assuming you haven't reconfigured its behaviour, it should pop up a dialog with options to Sleep, Restart, or Shutdown the laptop. The "Reopen windows when logging back in" checkbox has keyboard focus by default; hitting the kbdTab/kbd key twice will put focus on the strongSleep/strong button - hitting the Space bar will then put the MacBook Air to sleep.  (Note that hitting kbdReturn/kbd will activate the dialog's default action - namely, to shut the computer down.)  Not as quick as a single keyboard shortcut, but faster than the mouse and without closing the lid. :)  <answer28166> Keyboard shortcut is kbdOption/kbd+kbdCmd/kbd+kbdEject/kbd (the Eject key is at your keyboard upper right corner).  <answer28168> You can assign any unused key combination (like kbdfn/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdF12/kbd) using codeSystem Preferences/code » codeKeyboard/code » codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code » codeApplication Shortcuts/code Click the code+/code button, then under codeApplication/code, leave codeAll Applications/code, under codeMenu Title/code enter codeSleep/code, and under codeKeyboard Shortcut/code, press kbdfn/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbd⌥/kbdkbdF12/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Apz1W.png" alt="enter image description here"  Another option, if you're more Terminal-inclined:  ul likbd⌘/kbdkbdspace/kbd/li liType Terminal/li lipush kbdEnter/kbd/li liType codesudo shutdown -s now/code/li /ul  <answer28169> If others do have a keyboard with an eject key, you can just press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd.  Other shortcuts:  kbdControl ^/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd - Put displays to sleepbr kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdControl ^/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd - Restartbr kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdControl ^/kbd+kbdOption ⌥/kbd+kbdEject ⏏/kbd - Shut down  If others like the OP have a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro with a power key in place of an eject key, substituting the power key for eject should work in Mountain Lion and later versions of OS X, but not in Lion.  Since Mavericks, another option is to just press the power button or power key. It now puts a Mac to sleep instead of showing a dialog with different options.  If you don't have a keyboard with an eject or power key, you can use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::S, VK_CONTROL, VK_OPTION, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt;  &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Or create a workflow like this in Alfred:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BSe0d.png" alt=""  <answer28243> Press the power button, then S.  As described in this thread:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3273071?start=0&amp;tstart=0  emThe power button displays the Sleep/Restart/Shutdown dialog.  If you then press S the Mac will sleep./em  <answer119538> h2Keyboard Shortcut/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eIMxT.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Sleep Mac while it is running/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3IyNY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210850> For everyone strongwithout/strong a mac keyboard, I advice you to install strongKarabiner/strong.    Once opened, you can go under "Change Key" tab and search for sleep:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JkXHm.png" alt="enter image description here"  With this option checked, now you can:  ul liprompt restart/sleep/shutdown dialog: kbdCtrl/kbdkbdAlt/kbdkbdDel/kbd/li liforce immediately sleep: kbdShift/kbdkbdCtrl/kbdkbdAlt/kbdkbdDel/kbd/li /ul  <answer250594> Using Karabiner (previously named KeyRemap4MacBook), you can remap your codeF19/code key (or any other F key for that matter) to make the computer sleep using the following codeprivate.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;F19 to Sleep&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;Sleep&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;         __KeyToKey__         KeyCode::F19,         KeyCode::VK_CONSUMERKEY_EJECT, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L | ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L     &lt;/autogen&gt;  &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  To use a different F key, simply change all occurrences of codeF19/code to something else.  F19 works best for me since it's at the top right edge of the full-size wired Apple keyboard, making it hard to hit it by mistake and easy to find in the dark.  <answer283234> I was totally happy using Karabiner but:     Karabiner does not work on macOS Sierra at the moment.   I got bored of waiting so I solved by myself.   strongWhat I need?/strong  I need a command line to sleep mac, and this is pretty easy:  precodepmset sleepnow  /code/pre  strongWho can I run the script?/strong This is more boring, but not complicated:  ul liopen automator and create a new service/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2gfbG.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liselect 'run shell script' and write the above command /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oMAkr.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul lisave with name "sleepService" and your are in!/li /ul  Now the easy part: open strongSystem Preferences-Keyboard/strong and type your custom shortcut!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wypKk.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment32322> Not on the new MacBook Air models. No eject key. <comment32409> Thank you for mentioning that spacebar triggers the focused button. That was not obvious to me at all. <comment32417> Nice! Two fewer keystrokes than my solution. :) <comment32418> I would like to figure out if there is some rhyme or reason to the 'S' key activating the Sleep button. I wonder if there a consistent convention for which letters activate which buttons in osx. <comment72011> The power key can be substituted for eject on Mountain Lion and later versions of OS X. It works for other shortcuts like ⌃⇧⏏ as well. <comment86177> Yep, this is nice. Keeping it uniform across all Macs :) <comment114981> [How do you change the behavior of the power button in Lion?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/31231/8546) (2011-11-14) notes that for some users, simply pressing the power button will sleep the Mac without a dialogue. <comment168674> This just turns off the display on older Macs. On the newer Macs this is the same as sleep, as far as I understand, but it might confuse people with older machines.
