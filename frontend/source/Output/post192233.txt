Can't install inkscape on Yosemite with homebrew <body> It seems like I should be able to install inkscape with something like  precodebrew install inkscape /code/pre  based on what I've seen online. Unfortunately, when I try this I get  precodeError: No available formula for inkscape  Searching formulae... Searching taps... /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer192235> Try this way:  precode$ brew search inkscape homebrew/x11/inkscape $ brew tap homebrew/x11/inkscape $ brew install inkscape /code/pre  <answer200726> strongUpdate 2017/strong:  The preferred method to install Inkscape with homebrew in 2017 is:  precodebrew update brew cask install xquartz brew cask install inkscape /code/pre  strongPrevious Answer/strong:  Inkscape is a cask that you need to tap first before installing.  I tried a few of the suggestions given on this page, and the only thing that worked for me is a minor variation to strongjherran's/strong answer:  precode$ brew search inkscape $ brew tap homebrew/gui $ brew install inkscape /code/pre  At that point, I got the response strongcodeInstalling inkscape from homebrew/homebrew-x11/code/strong and the installation completed successfully. The result from the codebrew search/code command has changed a few times so be on the guard for it to change again and just tap the correct reply from the search command if it's not codehomebrew/gui/code next time you search.  <answer204675> This worked for me on 10.10.4 with brew:  precodebrew update brew install homebrew/x11/inkscape /code/pre  I actually didn't need to run codebrew tap homebrew/x11/code.  <answer234223> Had the pleasure of attempting this on a fresh install of El Capitan this morning. I wanted both the GUI and command line interface. Unfortunately, it seems that the sanest solution was to install two versions, one from brew (for CLI) and the other from brew-cask (for GUI).  precode$ brew search inkscape homebrew/gui/inkscape Caskroom/cask/inkscape  $ brew cask install xquartz # required for GUI  $ brew cask install inkscape # for GUI  $ brew install homebrew/gui/inkscape # for CLI (yep) ==&gt; Installing inkscape from homebrew/gui ==&gt; Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles-gui/ ==&gt; Pouring inkscape-0.91_3.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local Could not symlink bin/inkscape Target /usr/local/bin/inkscape already exists. You may want to remove it:   rm '/usr/local/bin/inkscape' To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:   brew link --overwrite inkscape  $ brew link --overwrite inkscape # to get the CLI inkscape on your path rather than the brew-cask GUI /code/pre  The problem with using the Cask version of Inkscape is that it doesn't handle relative paths very nicely, and apparently using it as a CLI isn't recommended. But I was unable to get the vanilla Homebrew version of Inkscape working as a GUI.  <answer264344> This worked for me on Sierra (10.12.1) in December 2016.   precodebrew update brew cask install xquartz brew cask install inkscape /code/pre  Reboot machine.   Launch Inkscape from Applications directory. Wait a minute for the font cache to be built.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwyEM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer281539> This works on Sierra 2017.  precodebrew update brew cask install xquartz /code/pre  Restart your machine.  precodebrew cask install inkscape /code/pre  <answer282611> As authors in the official website says for Homebrew:     If you've previously installed inkscape you should clean it before next installation:  precodebrew uninstall inkscape brew cleanup /code/pre   strongInstallation:/strong  precodebrew install caskformula/caskformula/inkscape  /code/pre  <answer285593> I have installed it successfully with the following command line:  precodebrew install caskformula/caskformula/inkscape /code/pre  <comment228579> I get `homebrew/x11/inkscape   Caskroom/cask/inkscape` from `brew search inkscape`, but when I try `brew tap` for both `homebrew/x11/inkscape` and `Caskroom/cask/inkscape` I get `Error: Invalid tap name` <comment228583> If you have brew cask, you can install it by typing `brew install Caskroom/cask/inkscape`. <comment228720> ok, I installed homebrew cask, this seemed to make the installation work. Unfortunately inkscape still doesn't work from the command line (tells me `failed to load the requested file`) which makes it worthless to me. For some reason `brew uninstall inkscape` also doesn't work... <comment228722> Try this: `brew uninstall Caskroom/cask/inkscape` <comment233594> The "tap" command didn't work for me. I instead did `brew install hombrew/x11/inkscape` and that worked great. Might be something for the new version <comment235028> @danielson317 that worked for me.  Thanks! <comment285633> While following these instructions today (with Homebrew 0.9.9 and OSX 10.10) the result of `brew search inkscape` was `homebrew/gui/inkscape`. Running `brew tap homebrew/gui` and `brew install inkscape` works as before. <comment285670> @Pathogen You're right. I had to install Inkscape again a few weeks ago and my own answer no longer worked for me. I've been meaning to update it. I'll get to it soon. Thanks! <comment286354> Well done - chasing which cask and dependency is needed has changed quite a lot over the years for this package. Thanks for the great update. <comment300532> With the current homebrew version tapping is no longer needed for inkscape. `brew cask install inkscape` does the job (assuming you had previously installed `xquartz`) <comment301838> `brew cask install inkscape` installs a distinct package from `brew install inkscape` See my answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/234223/106609 <comment359108> `brew install caskformula/caskformula/inkscape` would be for version 0.92.1 which does not (yet) have a dmg distribution.   while `brew cask install xquartz`, `brew cask install inkscape` would be an alternative to dmg for a 0.91 stable install. hence, "cask" vs. "caskformula".
