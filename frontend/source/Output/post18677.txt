My mother, who has arthritis, and so finds accurate mouse clicking by no means easy, often lost mail folders by doing this.  Lion fixes the problem: if you slip when clicking on a folder in Mail, you only emselect/em the neighbouring folder, with no harm done. It's a very subtle and impressive piece of user interface design, that most users will never notice.  <answer19959> strongExpanding threads with right arrow still works in Mail.app/strong  It might be obvious for everyone else except me, but I just noticed that pressing the right arrow key in Mail.app when a collapsed thread is selected still expands the thread as it used to work in Mail in Snow Leopard and before. This is very useful when one wants to flag only one email of a long thread as it is easy to navigate to the right email and pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbdL/kbd to flag it - no need to use the mouse.  <answer20256> strongDiagnose wi-fi problems/strong  Apple have added a useful little utility to diagnose wi-fi problems (check signal strength, see wi-fi related events, and even packet capture seem to be included).  To access it use :  precodeopen /System/Library/CoreServices/Wi-Fi\ Diagnostics.app /code/pre  from the terminal.  <answer20745> When in full screen mode in Safari, try dragging in from the sides to shrink the page width while staying in full screen mode.  via @MacTip  <answer22794> If you are selecting a rectangle for making a screenshot (e.g. with kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd4/kbd) you can press and hold kbdspace/kbd to reposition the origin point of the rectangle without resizing it. Holding kbd&#x21E7;/kbd at the same time you can reposition the rectangle at along an axis. And if you hold only kbd&#x21E7;/kbd you can resize the rectangle along an axis (in both cases depending on the direction you initially move the mouse).  This is quite handy if you need to make precise screenshots and you don't want to spend a lot of time post processing your screenshots. The only bad thing about the selection rectangle is the fact that the borders are 2 pixels wide which makes it difficult to see the exact bounding of the rectangle.  <answer24344> Highlight Stack Items on Hover  Launch the Terminal and type the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilite-stack -boolean yes /code/pre  then, you’ll have to restart the Dock by issuing the following command:br  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  To disable the hover highlights, type:br  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock mouse-over-hilite-stack -boolean no /code/pre  then, restart the dock:  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  <answer24345> Add A Recent Applications Stack to the Dock  Launch the terminal and type the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-others -array-add '{ "tile-data" = { "list-type" = 1; }; "tile-type" = "recents-tile"; } /code/pre  then you'll have to restart the Dock by issuing the following command:  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  The Dock will disappear for a moment then reappear. Your Dock will have a Recent Applications Stack located to the left of the Trash icon.  <answer25807> strongHolding kbd⇧/kbd when opening an application skips Resume/strong  So far I have gotten this to work via Finder, Spotlight, Launchpad, and Dock icons, but not via Alfred.  <answer38482> When using a Magic Mouse, you can enable a gesture to start Mission Control when you two-finger double tap the mouse (just tapping the surface, no clicking needed) in codeSystem Preferences &gt; Mouse &gt; More Gestures (tab)/code.  If this feature is enabled, you can hover the mouse cursor over a dock icon, use the same gesture for Mission Control, but instead you will show all windows for the particular application being hovered over.  EDIT: Furthermore, when you use the gesture over a dock icon, it will show the recent items (for the appropriate apps) at the bottom of the screen.  <answer44834> To hide your desktop icons, use the following command:   precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false /code/pre  Afterwards, enter the following to make the changes go into effect:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  To revert back, simply type:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true /code/pre  And remember to kill Finder once again.  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  Source: OSXDaily  <answer73136> Always felt,it would be handy if there is a keyboard shortcut to access the application menu bar.br Like in Windows, we can use (kbdAlt/kbd+First letter of the menu) to activate that menu.

Xcode crashed every time I opened a font window or IB and of course when reopening it, it comes back to the same place and crashes. <comment20660> Dude you are a lifesaver! <comment20675> does this really kill the spell check or does this just get rid of the accent character picker? <comment20678> @Bryan this should only affect the Press&Hold accent char picker. The spell checker is available in System Preferences and sometimes (bugs) it has to be manually disabled per-app. <comment20880> Lifehacker: Top 10 Secret Features in Mac OS X Lion - http://lifehacker.com/5817644 <comment20990> That's effectively a move operation. I'm not a Mac user and am wondering if this is the first time it's been made available through key strokes? <comment21260> The nice folks at TUAW have created an app which makes this easier:  http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/26/dear-aunt-tuaw-help-me-fine-tune-session-window-restores/ <comment21287> Yes. The problem with cut and paste is that it's destructive (When you cut the file got deleted, if you never paste the file again, that file is lost). So Mac never supports cut and paste (but supports drag and drop, again because that's not destructive). Thus this implementation is very elegant. <comment21894> Caution: first use of an unnamed version of [Resuminator by TUAW seems to break the global preference](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/07/26/dear-aunt-tuaw-help-me-fine-tune-session-window-restores#aolc=A5tz9g). <comment22501> Nice!

On Windows, the user interface seems to suggest file “disappears” when it is cut (it becomes pale) but if you never paste, it'll be right there as well. <comment22540> Every time a Windows refugee asks "why can't I cut and paste files in Finder?", someone else always responds with that same argument ("what if you never paste?"). Why do they assume that such a behavior would be so stupidly implemented? As Dan Abramov mentioned, "cutting" files has never been destructive on any system I've used. <comment22823> i LOVE this! so much better than the way cut works, which deletes the file until it's pasted <comment25423> I thought that was a bug <comment27346> @Jonathan Nope it's not a bug, it's a feature. <comment29592> This is awesome! I just realized I'm tired of the whiteness fullscreen mode brings. <comment39467> Wow, glad I found this. The lack of cut and paste in the Finder is maddening, but I just accepted it as an annoyance and never bothered to pursue it because I assumed it was a weird philosophical decision that would have a nonsensical justification. Apparently I was right, I've put a lot of time in on other operating systems and have never been burned by dangerous cut and paste behavior, the "destructive" line of reasoning is asinine. Glad to know that there is an equivalent behavior. <comment47199> This also affects Mail.app <comment51170> Good tip, but I don't believe this is specific to Lion (10.7.x) <comment215532> This is super great, it's worth just making a shortcut to the Applications folder
