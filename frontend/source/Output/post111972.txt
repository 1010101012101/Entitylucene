What happens when someone in the US clicks on a GB itunes URL? <body> If I provide a GB url itunes link to an app, say   https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id586088546  what would happen if someone in outside the UK, say in the states clicks on that? would it work or would it redirect to a version on their regional app store?  <answer111977> It will try to open the app's page on the iTunes Store linked to the account (when opened in iTunes).   For example, for me, it opened the page on the french store.   <answer111979> The view from Chicago is below. The prices are in GBP. When I click on the View in iTunes link, the prices change to USD.  Staying in my browser, if I change codegb/code to codeus/code in your original URL, the prices change to USD but everything else seems to stay the same.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JoK9C.png" alt="enter image description here"
