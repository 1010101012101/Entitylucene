Does anyone have any comparisons between identical Xcode projects on MBP and MBAs (latest models)? <body> It's the usual story of, 'Can I effectively code/build/simulate iOS apps on a MacBook Air rather than a MacBook Pro?'  I'm after actual comparative measurements. The more data the better; compilation times, memory usage, clean build to simulator, rebuild to simulator, etc.  Feel free to pick good sized projects from Github or similar, or personal and report in.
