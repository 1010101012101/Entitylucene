Can [Update Needed] be removed without disabling/enabling FileVault? <body> I have an additional user code[Update Needed]/code appear on login screen at every boot, which doesn't affect usability but a bit annoying. I googled for solution, but all of them are just disabling and enabling FileVault again. That would be time-consuming, somewhat harmful to the SSD, and would leave bits of sensitive data unencrypted on the disk. Is there any other way? Like some terminal commands?  <answer164026> If the Mac in question is running OS X 10.8.x or later, you can remove users from the list of FileVault enabled accounts using the strongfdesetup remove/strong command. To remove the account using the username, run the following command:  precodesudo fdesetup remove -user username /code/pre  Successful removal of the account will not produce any additional output.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6z6kt.png" alt="enter image description here"  If the account being removed is not currently enabled for use with FileVault 2, an error message will be displayed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1Osy.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Does the icon you're seeing look like this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z22Sv.png" alt="enter image description here"  If it does, this isn't a user account. It's a password directly associated with the disk's encryption. You will need to decrypt in order to get rid of it.  <comment192257> The problem is that the pseudouser was created prior to the installation of Yosemite by the Disk Utility. So my operating system doesn't actually have this account. <comment192258> Even with `sudo fdesetup list`, I have only my own accounts showed up.
