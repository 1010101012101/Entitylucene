Need to boot MacBook Pro into USB recovery mode <body> I am trying to help someone recover data from a non-functional MBP (it was dropped).  I have the internal drive mounted in a sled and connected to another MBP via USB. I can boot off of the drive holding the Option key and get the login screen but, as the password is unknown, I need to boot the drive into the external drive's recovery partition, open up the Terminal and execute the coderesetpassword/code command.  How can I do this?  <answer246593> I suggest you switch HDDs with the one on the sled and have it put on the functional MBP and just access the recovery partition from there. :)  <answer246602> You don't need to boot from it to recover data - in fact it's probably far easier if you don't.   If you have the drive mounted from an external USB, you can just Get Info &amp; check 'ignore ownership' - that will work unless the drive is encrypted.   If it is, you need the password.   <answer246634> ol liBoot up in Single User Mode off the USB.

Thankfully I was able to "hack" the password from hints that the person I am helping gave me.
