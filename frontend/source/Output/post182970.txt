Paste To Match Style App Shortcut <body> I have to copy and paste a lot of stuff and it bugs me when the formatting is copied over, In pages there's a way to paste using the destination formatting but the keyboard shortcut is 4 keys long which annoying.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7thoVm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there anyway to change the in-app shortcuts or generally just swap them around so cmd + V will paste and match the style?  I've already looking in system preferences but I can't see anything like this  <answer182971> App Shortcuts defined in System Preferences → Keyboard → Shortcuts → App Shortcuts override the default shortcuts.  Therefore, you can set up the shortcuts so that Paste is ⌥⇧⌘V and Paste and Match Style is ⌘V, as this will override the standard shortcuts.                            img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7m6l.png" width="408"  <comment217963> Hah! that's great, i'll accept in a few mins when it lets me, thanks
