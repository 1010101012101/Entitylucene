How to get the postion of the lid <body> I am trying to figure out what the position of the lid is. Whether it is open or closed. Is there a terminal command or a cocoa code snippet for this?  I've already tried codepmset -g/code but i can only get the sleep modes and the lidwake status.  <answer189103> I don't have a macbook by my side, is maybe  precodeioreg -r -k AppleClamshellState -d 4 | grep AppleClamshellState  | head -1 /code/pre  still working ?   <comment224079> You are my hero, works perfectly fine. Thank you very much :)
