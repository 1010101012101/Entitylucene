macOS Mission Control strange behavior on Sierra <body> I have noticed a bug in Mission Control on macOS Sierra (10.12.2).  Here's a GIF to reproduce the bug:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6AroV.gif" alt="enter image description here"  It happens when I try to open an app from the Dock, while I'm showing the Desktop: the app doesn't open, windows come back in place, then if I toggle Mission Control, the app I clicked before opens (or get in front if already opened).  Step by step, as shown in GIF:  ol liShow Desktop/li liClick on any app in the Dock/li liApp won't open, windows come back in place instead/li liOpen Mission control/li liExit Mission control: previously clicked app opens/li /ol  Is anyone experiencing the same?  <answer266737> I was able to replicate the bug with your instructions. (mid-2014 rMBP, macOS 10.12.2) I would recommend that you report it to Apple to alert them of the bug.  <comment334553> Thanks, I already reported it to Apple. I also started another discussion on their official support forum, where other users confirmed the same behavior: https://discussions.apple.com/message/31173836 <comment352332> This is fixed on Sierra 10.12.4
