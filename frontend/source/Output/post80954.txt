How do I refresh a "Lion" iMac to run "Mountain Lion" (factory install, wipe drive) <body> What is the easiest way to upgrade a 2011 iMac to Mountain Lion, including a full drive reformat?   I also have a new MacBook which was purchased with Mountain Lion. Do I still need to buy Mountain Lion for the iMac?  Booting with Cmd-R will allow a http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4718  Here are some ideas:  ol liBuy Mountain Lion in app store, then upgrade, then boot with Cmd-R to reset the drive./li liLike #1, but first do the Cmd-R to reset the system, and then buy Mountain Lion in app store to upgrade./li liCreate install DVDs from Macbook Pro with Mountain Lion (how?) although I'd to use another machine to burn the DVDs. Or maybe use an external USB hard drive?/li /ol  Update: I found this program http://liondiskmaker.com/ And this which suggests how to get the image on a new mac that has mountain lion http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110831105634716  Thanks,  Justin  <answer80992> I always do option 3. You should be able to pretty much follow these directions, even though they reference Lion: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1189888  Long story short: When you buy an app from the app store it is stored on your drive in a format that can be burnt.  Of course, the USB drive option is also doable and it sounds like that would be easier for you.  <comment93352> 1, just in the off chance the recover partition is slightly different in 10.8 from 10.7 <comment93416> Any idea if this should work for Mountain Lion from a Macbook Pro? Or just guessing? I checked the discussion thread you posted, but that was only for Lion. I'm trying to avoid experimentation and yak shaving during this exercise. <comment93431> I've done this with Mountain Lion on my MacBook Pro. The only difference is that I was installing the resulting image on the same MBP. But I think it is the same regardless of the system when you download it from the app store.  Also I vaguely recall that the image was named slightly different on Mountain Lion, but the procedure was the same.
