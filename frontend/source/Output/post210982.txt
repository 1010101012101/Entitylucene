Why won't Facetime ring when somebody calls me? <body> My volume is turned up, it's not on mute, alarms and other things that make noise work, it's not set to "do not disturb" or anything like that. If I happen to have the iPad open when a Facetime call arrives I can see it, but it's silent and not ringing.  Facetime works fine except if somebody calls me it won't ring.   <answer212040> Several things have to go correctly when an incoming FaceTime call happens.  ol liApple's push notification servers have to have a recent internet address for the "location" of your iPad./li liThe network needs to deliver that push notification to your router./li liYour router needs to send a wake notification if your iPad is sleeping./li liYour iPad needs to be connected to the WiFi network or wake and reconnect, get an IP address, receive the push notification before the call times out./li /ol  Things that make your network more reliable:  ul liCellular Data connection on the iPad so that there is a chance to receive the notification from WiFi and from the cellular data/li liPlug the iPad into power so that the radios take longer to power off and dissociate from the network./li lireduce network congestion on your network/li liincrease the signal between your iPad and the providing WiFi and cellular data radio base stations/li liconnecting to the WiFi each time you change network locations to update Apple's push servers with your iPad's current location. For example - if I leave my house and go to a coffee shop with my iPad in a bag - it won't connect to the coffee shop and receive FaceTime without my help since /li /ul  You can also ask people to send you an iMessage before they try to face time or to make two face time calls in a row. The first notification might wake up the router and iPad and the second would then go through.  <answer223393> Go into settings,notifications,FaceTime,sounds, then select your ring tone preference.  <answer227400> Go to codeSettings/code, then to codeDo not disturb/code and make sure it is set to allow all calls from FaceTime.    My iPad  had been set to silence all incoming face time calls.  <comment256021> I have the exact same problem. Still haven't found an answer. I have a 3rd generation iPad, fully updated. Originally, FT ringer was working fine. If im sitting right in front of my device when someone calls, I can answer and everything else functions normally. <comment270866> Then go into settings, sounds. Make sure the volume slider is on  and not muted. I then had to reboot my iPad for it to work correctly.
