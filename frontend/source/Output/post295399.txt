MacOS: Increasing the number of reminder snooze options <body> This is an issue I've faced for such a long time on macOS as well as iOS, though for the purposes of this question I'd like to focus on macOS as that is the only format where, I hope, manually editing settings files emmight/em even be a possible solution to this problem.  If a emcalendar/em alert pops up on macOS, we're presented with some quite usable snooze options: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 1 day, or 1 week. Screenshot here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoXgBm.png" alt="Calendar snooze options"  On the flip side, if a emreminder/em alert pops up on macOS, one only has the option to snooze it for 5 minutes, 1 hour, or until tomorrow, with nothing in between. This has obvious implications: if there's something you want to do in 15 minutes or 30 minutes, you don't have that option. You can only push the reminder to 5 minutes over and over, or push it a whole hour and risk not getting to it in time. This screenshot shows what I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qO9vem.png" alt="Reminder snooze options"  On iOS its even worse. If a reminder pops up, a user can only choose between "mark as completed", "remind me in 1 hour", or "remind me tomorrow" with a hard press on the iPhone 7.  I feel like Apple has decided that a reminder is for something to be done NOW (or max in 5 minutes) and doesn't want people postponing reminders in say 15 minute increments. I mean, if anything its Calendar timeslots that might be (marginally) more immediate and fixed in time than reminders, aren't they? I think its crazy to only have a choice between 5 minutes and a full hour to postpone our reminders, while being forced to go into the reminders app to manually change the time for each alert!  I've read through prior posts (on here and other forums) skirting this topic but there doesn't seem to be a conclusive answer: strongemis there any way (or any place deep in the mac config files) to manually edit the native list of reminder "postpone" duration options to at least match the calendar "snooze" options/em/strong, or are we totally out of luck save for downloading software such as Snoozemaster which doesn't natively sort the problem, or having to specify a reminder snooze time via Siri (difficult in a quiet office environment)?  <comment372972> You should submit your opinions to [Apple Feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/).  Also, is *rescheduling* the alarm out of the realm of possibility?
