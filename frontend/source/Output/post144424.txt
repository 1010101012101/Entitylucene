Reset Admin password/ unauthorized password change <body> My ex-wife managed to get on to my Mac (OS X 10.9.4) and change my password for log on.  Luckily, I am still able to access my Mac as she didn't set it to screen lock.  What do I need to do in order to get back to my old password so that I can set a new one. Can I simply restore from my Time Machine to get it back to my old password?  Or do I need more advanced help?  <answer144425> h2Resetting User Account Password (10.7 +)/h2  ol liBoot into your Recovery Partition holding down kbdCommand/kbd + kbdR/kbd at the startup chime/li liSelect "Terminal" from your "Utilities" Menu Bar/li liType the following command in: coderesetpassword/code/li liFrom the window that appears, select your boot volume and the appropriate user account/li liType in the new password and confirm the new password/li liClick "Save", close this pane and quit Utilities/li liSelect boot volume again when presented with "Choose Startup Disk" and reboot your machine/li /ol  <comment170114> no duplicate... just trying to figure out if i can reset using my time machine.  Will time machine take it back to the password I was using?  I last backed up four days ago and it was just changed tonight. <comment170115> will this delete anything currently on my mac? or do i need to do a time machine boot up? <comment170116> This won't delete anything on your current Mac. It will just reset the password. Time Machine isn't necessary. <comment170117> so shut down the computer... hold down command + R at the startup chime and follow the rest of your steps?  What is the boot volume?  There's only one account on there which was mine. <comment170118> @James Yes. Print out instructions if necessary. [Here's one that includes pictures.](http://pondini.org/OSX/Password.html) It's quite simple. Boot volume is your main volume. IE, "Macintosh HD" by default. <comment170119> Recovering from TimeMachine may be an option, but the answer linked to by @njboot above offers a much easier way to solve your problem. <comment170121> awesome!!!  I will try it out now!  Thanks for the assist!  You're a lifesaver! <comment170123> @James no problem. cheers.
