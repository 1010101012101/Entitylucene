Converting string to int doesn't work properly in terminal <body> Converting string to int doesn't work properly in terminal.  I want to find how much time specific string occur in a big string.   precodeif ((echo "iOS/i" | grep -o iOS/ | wc -l | bc)&gt;2) then echo "ThreeOrMore"; else echo"TwoOrLess"; fi /code/pre  result   precodeThreeOrMore /code/pre  But the result actually should be TwoOrLess  but inner part works well  precodeecho "iOS/i" | grep -o iOS | wc -l | bc /code/pre  result   precode1 /code/pre  <answer179576> You can't use code&gt;/code to compare numbers in codebash/code (code&gt;/code is used to redirect output to a file), you need to run the comparison as part of a codetest/code/code[/code command. Also the call to codebc/code doesn't seem to do anything, codeecho "iOS/i" | grep -o iOS | wc -l/code already outputs code1/code.  The updated snippet looks like this (split on several lines for easier readability):  precodeif [ $(echo "iOS/i" | grep -o iOS/ | wc -l) -gt 2 ]; then     echo "ThreeOrMore" else     echo "TwoOrLess" fi /code/pre  <comment212911> So | wc -l is needed. I tried to omit wc -l, but this expression didn't returned 3 : echo "iOS/iOS/iOS" | grep -o -c iOS <comment212912> Ah, looks like I just learned something. Thanks, I'll edit the answer accordingly.
