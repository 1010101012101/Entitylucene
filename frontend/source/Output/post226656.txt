Notes.app asks to verify a certificate each time I start it <body> Every time I open Notes.app on El Capitan, I get a popup asking me to verify a certificate.  The certificate is about one of the websites I manage, but I don't get why it asks about it when I open such app...  I've tried marking the certificate as secure in the management panel but it still asks me about it each time.  How can I stop it?  <answer226667> Go to strongSystems Preferences/strong  strongInternet Accounts/strong select the account of the website you manage and disable the strongNotes/strong.  <comment275250> Ah, it works :| thanks! <comment275252> No prob, can you please mark the question as answered? <comment275253> Yup I was waiting the X minutes needed <comment275255> Oh sorry! Didn't realize that!
