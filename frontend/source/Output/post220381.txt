Is there a task manager for OS X El Capitan? <body> Something's causing my Mac to bottleneck on startup and on wake. I'm curious if I can isolate this by leaving a monitor program running so I can see what's eating up the CPU.   How can I check CPU usage like Task Manager on Windows allows?  <answer220410> The strongOS X/strong equivalent of emWindows Task Manager/em is strongActivity Monitor/strong, located in /Applications/Utilities/, or emtype/em strongActivity Monitor/strong in strongSpotlight/strong.  See Activity Monitor's internal Help: emActivity Monitor  Help  Activity Monitor Help/em  For more information see Apple's Support Document: Use Activity Monitor on your Mac  Also, as mentioned by klanomath, for more specialized scenarios there is strongInstruments/strong in strongXcode/strong. em(Xcode  Developer Tools  Instruments)/em  Help for the Command Line version of Instruments, in a Terminal emtype/em: codeman instruments/code  Or see Apple's Instruments User Guide.  <answer220616> In a simpler way, you can also use the UNIX command codetop/code which you can enter in a command line to show the top process eating your memory or CPU.  To sort the process my memory usage, just use codetop -o MEM/code and if you want to sort the process by CPU usage, you can use codetop -o CPU/code.   <comment266723> Is the built-in Activity Monitor not adequate? <comment266724> Or more specialized: Xcode-Developer Tools-Instruments?
