Updating Xcode looping the download process <body> In my trial to update my Xcode 7 to Xcode 8 on macOS Sierra:  ol liI have opened Appstore and searched for Xcode. Beside the Xcode app I found the emInstall/em button and clicked it./li liThe 4.4GB Xcode finished download as per the gauge stuck to the bottom of the launchpad icon after waiting for 30min./li liI didn't find the Xcode icon inside launchpad./li liI tried to search Xcode but search didn't return any Xcode app./li liI opened Appstore again to open the Xcode from inside Appstore./li liI spotted the Xcode app in purchases of Appstore and found emInstall/em button instead of emOpen/em button beside it to my dismal./li liI've gone ahead and clicked emInstall/em button and downloaded(4.4GB) again./li liNow at 99.9% download failed. Appstore said img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UXqM.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow in the launchpad I am happy to see a Xcode icon but I also found a broken icon downloading something which is 4.4GB; Obviously its Xcode. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sxvxg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"/li liI am able to get rid of the broken icon by long clicking the icon and clicking the popped up 'X' on the jiggling icon./li liI have encountered same issue a year ago when I updated Xcode6 to 7. This is definitely a serious bug; I have to download Xcode twice each time i try to update it./li liI have filed a bug in bug reporter to which no one responds./li liSo I think its I'm the only one who is having the issue as I might have tampered something in the macOS. The App store still shows emInstall/em button besides the Xcode instead of emOpen/em button though its already got installed and I am using it. How to let know the Appstore that latest Xcode is already installed?/li /ol  <answer258479> I had issues to download Xcode 8 from App Store too. Just when is going to finish installation process, something happened and Xcode started downloading again.  I just needed Xcode 8 installed as fast possible. So I just passed to another step.  Thank you Apple, for dev apps there is a alternative to download them. Any version of Xcode and its tools, you can download through developer.apple.com, to check all tools that you can download come to this link. If you just need Xcode 8 this link is your friend.  Now I have Xcode 7 and 8 in my system. You can delete your old Xcode 7 if you want.  Sure, you need at least a free apple dev account to download them. Just enter your appleID and agree to Apple terms.  strongNote:/strong App Store shows me to update Xcode, maybe because I still have Xcode 7 installed.  <comment323098> You don't need to let the App store "know" anything.  Just kill the download from the App store, then go into the `/Applications/ directory and remove the `XCode.app` that you don't want. <comment323168> @Allan then why couldn't Appstore identify that the Xcode is already downloaded and wasted my limited bandwidth?
