3D modeling application for Mac? <body> Background: I recently upgraded my Mac, and it happens to have a pretty nice graphics card (not that my old one wasn't nice ... in 2006). While I didn't upgrade my Mac for this purpose, it has occurred to me that my life might be a tiny bit more efficient if I used some of this amazing graphics power that I now possess (and perhaps my old Wacom tablet) for sketching 3D designs, rather than my current method*.  So I hopped on over to the Mac App Store, typed in "3d modeling" (and every synonym I could think of), and was disappointed to see a pretty slim selection of apps.  Is there a good basic app for creating 3D objects?  Free is good, cheap is also good -- I don't mind paying but "3D modeling" frequently seems to mean "here's a $10,000 program that lets you make Lord of the Rings", and I'm sure it's amazing for that, but I don't need that.  I need: ability to create simple objects, mostly square or circular, including CSG, and to move them around and look at them from different angles.  I don't need: any particular file formats, or textures, or animation, or smooth organic surfaces like human faces.  If you think "designing a chest of drawers", that's about the level of sophistication that I'm looking for.  What TextEdit.app is for words, I want for 3D objects.  SketchUp is emalmost/em what I'm looking for, except it's kind of awkward and not entirely Mac-like, and to do any CSG you need the $500 "Pro" version (which I might get eventually, but it seems like there could well be something better and cheaper).  I'd emalmost/em be happy with something like POVRAY: the CSG is nice, the price can't be beat, but unfortunately it lacks any interactivity.  * (It involves whiteboards, paperboard and glue, and listening to old Yes albums while trying to visualize how things will fit together in space.)  <answer50916> Have you tried Blender?  <answer50928> Here's a pretty big list, with, presumably, all the info you might need. A description, the price, the requirements, and links to the Downloads page.  <answer50942> I would recommend 'Hexagon' from Daz3D, which they offer for free and it meets all your requirements.  <answer50947> My personal favourite is Maxon Cinema 4D. It has a nice learning curve, is fairly respected in the industry and does what you require very well (simple objects). It has a slightly Adobe-like feel to it. I found that for complex organic modelling you'd need to start looking at Maya or 3DS Max (PC on Bootcamp).  However, these options cost quite a lot - though C4D is less than many applications and is modular.  A cheaper ($99) option is Cheetah, available through the app store. Basic but nice.  As Nix said, Blender is a fantastic, free option. I just found the learning curve is a little more tricky than C4D.  <answer51032> A few years ago (2009) I compared the input and output formats available on a few 3D model apps.  Here is my list:  Javaviewbr   opens:  byu, jvx, objbr   exports: byu, fe, {jvd, jvx}, mgs, mpl, obj, off, stl, wrl  Geo3Dbr   opens: wrl {including ver 1}, 3ds, obj, 3dmfbr   exports: 3dmf  FbxConverter:br   opens: fbxbr   exports: dxf, obj, 3ds  FreeWRLbr   opens: x3d, wrl  Instant Playerbr   opens: x3d, wrl, [Instant Player Engine], [OpenSG Scene]  Maplebr   opens: mplbr   exports: x3d, dae, pov, dxf  <answer70053> I think you should have another look at SketchUp.  It's 'Mac-like' quality (on the Mac platform) has improved a bit and, I'm not sure I understand your CSG needs, but I would guess the increasing number of plug-ins now available makes it one of the best tools around. I can't think of anything better and cheaper.  I teach architecture and many of my students use the free SketchUp version in combination with Render[in], Artlantis or the new Maxwell Render for SketchUp plugin.  <answer89078> My personal recomendation is SCULPTRIS  http://www.pixologic.com/sculptris/  Free, simple, easy but powerfull.  ONLY use it for modeling ORGANIC models, i doesn's work with geometric or square models, remember, only organic. Later its perfect complement is ZBRUSH for amazing modeling from sculptris and great painting tools.  <answer89083> AutoDesk makes a Mac version of Maya. I'm partial to Maya as I learned 3D on it. If you're a student, you can get an educational discount, which is how I got it about 4 years ago. http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/free-trial  As others mentioned, there is also Blender which is free. I tried it but it there is a bit of a learning curve as strongmatt_w/strong mentioned.   <answer100328> I would recommend Verto Studio 3D. It is on the Mac App Store   <answer119685> Take a look at Shade 3D. You can get Shade 3D for Unity for free, and Shade 3D Basic is only $99. It has modeling, rendering and a lot of features you may not need now, but may decide you want later. Plus, its easy to get started with.  <comment118081> I would add that Maya is free for students through the AutoDesk web site. <comment118083> Can you explain *why* you recommend it? What does it do well? What are its limitations?
