Mavericks Finder No Coverflow <body> I just upgraded to Mavericks (late I know), and I'm not much liking the new Finder sorting system. I had it arranged by modified, for workflow reasons, but I liked the grid too, not the coverflow rows that happen now.  Is there a way to have the grid and 'arranged by modified'?  emEDIT/em By grid I mean the old icon layout, which now only happens with 'arrange by name.'  <answer141375> Cannot see why this cannot be done.  Select grid :-  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgfLh.png" alt="enter image description here"  then choose:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sPLv9.png" alt="enter image description here"  And you should get something like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWtMg.png" alt="enter image description here"  I you want to get rid of the grouping right click in the finder window   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CMWvo.png" alt="enter image description here"  and codeshow View Options/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5t6Vb.png" alt="enter image description here"  Set arrange to: By name  Set Sort by to : Date Modified   What you get is this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0p6WV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment166637> That's not what I mean by grid, that's the coverflow rows. Sort by name is the 'grid' layout it used to be. <comment166666> I think you are using the wrong terminology. Please explain in your question exactly what you mean by 'grid' as my answer uses the grid layout and NOT the coverflow layout. <comment166688> You want the icons to be scrolled downwards, not sideways - is that what you mean? <comment166693> I have made an edit that should give you what you want...sort by date but without the grouping <comment166999> @Paul Gilfedder - Thanks! Weird that I didn't manage that when I was playing around with it.
