iTunes, Proxy Authentication and NTLM <body> I am attempting to use iTunes through a work proxy.  When loading iTunes, it prompts me to enter a username and password for the http and https proxy servers, but fails, saying the password was incorrect. The pattern is that, the dialog will appear, details entered, and it will then ask for the http or https details, then repeat again and again.  ul liI have tried DOMAIN\username, like, NTADMIN\bob/li liMy network account is not locked/li liSometimes, after entering my username &amp; password on the first few times, I'm able to see some album art start to load.  So, on some instances, I'm getting through the proxy./li liMy password is definitely being entered correctly....  Yes, I'm sure, and yes it works./li liNetwork Connectivity Tests show: ul liNetwork interfaces verified/li liInternet connection verified/li liSecure link to iTunes Store emfailed/em./li /ul/li li(Technical) I have deleted my keychain &amp; even deleted all settings and installed./li li(Technical) iTunes is one of the only applications that don't work with the proxy./li li(Technical) I have managed to get it working if I specify my proxy as my local CNTLM application.  But I don't want to set my Windows system level proxy to always go through that./li /ul  So my questions are:  ol liIs this a bug in iTunes where it does not handle NTLM correctly?  Can this please be fixed?/li liIs there a way to force iTunes to use a specific proxy, rather than use the Windows system one?/li /ol  Thanks, Michael  <answer134885> Try CNTLM to convert your NTLM proxy to a local proxy without authentication. In this way iTunes is able to connect to the internet.  <answer273138> This happens when your proxy is set to "Use automatic configuration script". In order to fix this:  ol liOpen Internet Explorer / Edge/li liOpen the Internet Options (for IE: Gear wheel on the upper right, then Internet Options)/li liOpen the "Connections" Tab/li liClick "LAN settings"/li liMake sure that under "Proxy server" you have entered the proxy manually/li /ol  <comment152482> You're not alone... itunes use both the proxy and direct flow ! Look your firewall behind the proxy. Regards <comment160403> As advised in the comments, I've tried that approach.
