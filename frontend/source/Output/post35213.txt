OSX Lion Disk Mounter <body> I seem to have broken something in my OSX Lion install. Whenever I insert a SD/CD-ROM into the machine I have to go into Disk Util to manually mount it. This happens quite a lot and is getting on my nerves. Any ideas what I might have done or what might cause this?  Thanks  Gordon  <answer35227> The launchd daemons and agents should be mounting these for you...  ul licom.apple.diskarbitrationd/li licom.apple.diskmanagementd/li licom.apple.DiskArbitrationAgent/li /ul  ... so unless you were editing these or your filesystem had the files go corrupt it might be faster to install Lion onto an external drive and test to see if a clean install remedies the issue.   If so, you could migrate your data to that external drive and make sure it's not a configuration issue.   If not, you could then start down a hardware isolation or repair path.
