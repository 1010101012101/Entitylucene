Facebook App for iPhone and Photo upload <body> When I upload a picture from the Facebook App on the iPhone, the picture is placed in "Mobile Uploads" but it doesn't appear on the Wall. I have to share the picture from the web broswer on a computer to make it appear there. Any Ideas how to do that directly from the Facebook App?  hr  I don't know how, but somehow it's working now...  <answer3019> If you Click on “Photos” in the Mobile Facebook App, you should get a list of your “Albums”,   ul liTouch on an album and then touch on the little camera and follos the steps:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFP3D.jpg" alt="Step1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ra76w.jpg" alt="Step2" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDbic.jpg" alt="Step3" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nS4ti.jpg" alt="Step4"  <comment2688> thanks for the great screenshot step by step, but it still doesn't show on the News Feed. :( <comment2695> That’s strange, have you checked your Facebook App Settings (in Facebook’s website)? Does it have permission to “Publish content to my wall”? <comment2700> indeed very strange. i've checked the settings on FB web and I did a reset of all settings... still not working.
