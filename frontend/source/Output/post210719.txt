Mavericks to Yosemite Migration --- "cannot create user X" <body> Booting into Target Disk Mode on a Mavericks machine, the Migration Assistant goes through the motion of copying a user (applications already copied) to the new Yosemite machine. At the end there is an error something like "Cannot create user "x" (the user being migrated)". The user doesn't appear in the login panel but is there in the users folder. What gives?  <comment257993> Are you using Firewire/Thunderbolt to connect? Otherwise don't use Target Disk. Check if the account is at least registered using `dscacheutil -q user | grep -A 3 -B 2 -e uid:\ 5'[0-9][0-9]'` - I'm wondering if maybe there's a UID conflict. I once made the mistake of setting up a new user, **then** trying to migrate the same user from another machine - ended up having to manually massage one into the other to get the UIDs lined up properly. <comment258207> Thanks. Nothing worked until I booted into root user on the new machine, revealed all in finder, and then transferred manually via firewire and repaired permissions. It ended up that nothing, not even migration assistant, was transferring the library and other hidden items.
