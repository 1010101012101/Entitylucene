Must be an administrator to install <body> I administer several computers for users that are not admin users and am trying to install software onto all of them. Most of the computers simply ask for the administrative password during the install process, which I can supply. However, some of the computers will not ask for the administrator password, it will instead just give an error message saying only local administrators can install software. There is no correlation between operating systems and I can't see any settings in users &amp; permissions that would be different from one user to the next. My only work around is to make the users admins.  The software I'm installing is Carbonite, but I don't think it's related.  Thanks!  <answer270355> It sounds like you probably already have an Admin account setup on each computer for yourself (but if not, let's start there)... so, one option would be to log into the actual admin account when performing those installs.  However, standard troubleshooting for this issue would be to test in Safe Boot and see if get the Admin Password prompt while in the non-admin account. If it does help, then those computers have login items, launch agents, launch daemons, or startup items that cause the issue.  Test for us, then edit your post to include the steps you'd tried (even if it's very little), and we'll happily continue to help.  <answer270587> It sounds like there are two pre-requisites:  ol liThe software must be installed by the actual user/li liThe software requires admin privileges/li /ol  If those users are not admin you could either:  ol liMake them Admin (via System Preferences) temporarily for the duration of the install (then make standard user again)/li liAdd them to the 'wheel' group (again, temporarily if desired)/li /ol  <comment339761> Related or maybe a duplicate: [AD User as an administrator on the Mac?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66038/ad-user-as-an-administrator-on-the-mac) <comment339936> Normally I would log into the admin account to install software, however, because it is Carbonite, which backs up the user's files specifically, it needs to be installed and configured on the user's side. I will test your suggestion and let you know. Thanks! <comment340056> This will get Carbonite installed, but it won't solve whatever underlying problem exists that prevents the Installer from requesting admin approval. <comment340057> If it requires admin privs then it requires admin privs. That, in itself, isn't a 'problem'. <comment340090> It is a problem because other users that are not admins can install the same software and they are just prompted for the admin password. <comment340124> Perhaps those that can install are local admins (but not network)? But this is off the point. Did you follow the link from @klanomath, namely, this page? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202112 You mention that the error requests LOCAL admin, these directions might overcome that.
