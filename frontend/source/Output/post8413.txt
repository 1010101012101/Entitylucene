What control character do I send to the terminal to make it delete a full word at a time? <body> I recently discovered that sending \033[5D and \033[5C sends the character to move a full word at a time, making mac os x terminal almost as awesome as the default ubuntu and debian terminals.   So then, the one thing I'm missing is: the control key to bind option-delete and option-backspace to deletion of full words.   <answer8414> kbdctrl/kbd+kbdW/kbd will delete the previous word.  <answer8430> ol liSelect "Preferences..." from the Menu "Terminal"/li ligo into "Settings" and select your default window configuration, go into the tab "Keyboard"/li liHave a look at all keybindings, (eg. forward delete is bound to \033[3~ ) and note you can change them by double clicking (thats easier to use than bind in your code~/.bash_profile/code). /li /ol  If you choose to use kbd&#x2325;/kbd as meta-key, kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdbackspace/kbd will work immediately, though this setup might break special characters you can only input by pressing kbd&#x2325;/kbd together with them (depending on your keyboard layout). If you donÂ´t use that, you can delete by pressing kbdesc/kbd and than kbdbackspace/kbd.  For forward-deleting a whole word, use either kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdD/kbd or  kbdesc/kbd and than kbdD/kbd.  <comment9035> In the bare terminal, yes, but in emacs, it gets caught and has no effect.
