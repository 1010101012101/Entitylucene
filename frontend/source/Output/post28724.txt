Mac renames itself automatically - host name is incorrect in terminal <body> I've got a handleful of macs (all with unique names) and on occasion it prompt a notice about saying another computer on the network as this name and adds a (2) or (3) to my mac.    How can I set the host name from the command line?  <answer28738> There is a couple ways to go about solving this problem.  The immediate change is to to open up Terminal, and issue the command     sudo scutil --set HostName {your machine name here}   The next thing to do is to      sudo pico /etc/hostconfig    Add the following line, followed by Ctrl+O, and then Ctrl+X     HOSTNAME={your machine name here}   Finally reboot  <answer206056> Yes you can :  precodesudo scutil --set HostName "YourHostName" sudo scutil --set LocalHostName "YourLocalHostName" /code/pre  to change the computer name :   precodesudo scutil --set ComputerName "YourComputerName" /code/pre  To check if everything is okay : codesudo scutil --get HostName/code  <comment33029> You need to clarify this into an actual question rather than a discussion topic - I can do it for you, but seems fair to give you the chance. <comment33034> What router do you have?
