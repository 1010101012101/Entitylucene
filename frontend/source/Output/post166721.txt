Manipulate incoming HTML data <body> My ISP, injects JavaScript code into every website I visit. Is there a way to filter all incoming traffic in OS X and remove that injected code?  <comment195427> There is [greasekit](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit) with which you can inject your user scripts (you must design yours) which will remove the unwanted scripts. If you can provide more info about the javascript which is injected, I can try to write a javascript to solve this problem. <comment195461> Which URL is the javascript? <comment195493> Use a VPN, better and safer solution than an userscript (the ISP's JS may execute before your userscript removes it so it's pointless). <comment207709> Also, @Till, I recommend retitling this question to something like “Manipulate incoming HTTP responses”, since that will also cover anything else your ISP may try to shove on you.  (And I laud your efforts to break free of their crappy behavior!)
