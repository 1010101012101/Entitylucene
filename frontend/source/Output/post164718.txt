Play/Pause/Prev/Fwd buttons not working <body> strongWhat I have:/strong macOS 10.10.2(Yosemite) on an iMac mid-2011 + original wireless keyboard.  Suddenly, buttons for controlling iTunes (they are located on kbdF7/kbd, kbdF8/kbd and kbdF9/kbd buttons) stopped working. Meanwhile, other buttons (volume, brightness, launchpad, etc.) still work.  The keys work in other applications but not with iTunes.  Where should I look to fix this? Notice, the issue happened before updating to OS X Yosemite.  <answer175758> I found this to solve the problem for me, thanks to Major Hayden!  ...check your keyboard shortcuts in Chrome:  ul liChoose Preferences in the Chrome menu in the menu bar/li liClick Extensions in the left sidebar/li liScroll all the way to the bottom of the page/li liClick Keyboard Shortcuts/li liLook at the key bindings in the Google Play Music section/li liRemove them all by by pressing the 'X' icon next to them./li /ul  <answer234697> I found this to solve the problem for me.

But after a few days, the problem persists even though the shortcuts have been removed from Chrome. If I click in the textbox to add a shortcut, then the keys magically work. Has anyone else seen this problem? <comment338857> Does anyone have a solution that doesn't involve chrome?  I have this issue but chrome does not appear to be at fault.
