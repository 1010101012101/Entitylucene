Mac Pro 1,1 running Mac OS 10.6.8 <body> Am having finder freezing problems on Mac Pro 1,1 running 10.6.8. I want to run Apple Hardware Test software but I don't have the disk. I downloaded the program from Github and copied it to DVD, but when I try to run the program from the DVD while starting up, it does not load. Any ideas what I am doing wrong? Thanks.  <comment186888> Are you talking about this https://github.com/upekkha/AppleHardwareTest? It seems like you don’t need to brun it to DVD. Just follow the instructions and press **d** at start up. <comment186889> Possibly try booting with first **d**, maybe it’s already installed.
