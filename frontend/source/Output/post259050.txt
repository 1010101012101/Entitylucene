Handoff for a mail account not on other device <body> I open an email on my iPhone that is from an email account which is not setup on my MacBook. It is shown as available for Handoff in the task switcher. Selecting the app opens a blank mail with a busy spinner. Eventually the mail disappears with no error message. Is this supposed to work?  I see some indications from Google results that it works, but changes the mail sending server to iCloud. If it's not supported I would expect that either Handoff is not offered for an email in this account or an error saying that I need to add the account on all devices.
