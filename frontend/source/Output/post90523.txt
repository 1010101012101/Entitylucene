Move of time machine backup: unable to "restore" <body> I want to use a new hard drive for time machine. I try to restore the old backup into the new disk using disk utility. It fails with the following error :     source volume is read-write and cannot be unmounted, so it can't be   block copied   Why ? What can I do ?   <answer90524> Problem understood. The disks were actually locked by the failed copy of the backup folder I tried to do between the two disks shortly before.   If it happens to you, just make sure the disks are not locked. In the worse case, reboot.  <comment145586> Please mark this as the answer if your issue is resolved. Thank you! <comment316882> any chance you could elaborate on this? Ive no idea what any of this means, but reboot didn't help
