What keyboard command can be used to move the cursor to the end of the next word on the Mac? <body> In Windows and Ubuntu one can move the cursor to the end of the next word in text by pressing kbdctrl/kbd+ kbdleft/kbd or kbdctrl/kbd+kbdright/kbd.  What's the equivalent of this on the Mac?  <answer54130> kbdoption/kbd + kbdleft/kbd and kbdoption/kbd + kbdright/kbd  <answer96205> It's really quite simple: just us kbdCommand/kbd + kbdright/kbd or kbdleft/kbd.   <answer178613> This is a late return from an outlying precinct on this question, but on my 2014 MacBook Pro using Word 2011, I stumbled on to how to move to the beginning and the end using  "fn" + option + Left arrow, and Rt arrow respectively.  These combinations also work for the Word for Mac Preview v 15.8.  <comment61961> Command+left and Command+right brings you to the end or beginning of a line - something that I find really useful as well. <comment61983> ...something accomplished with Home and End on PCs. <comment61991> ... and why is it not listed in keyboard shortcuts ... <comment62002> @GEdgar Gremlings. <comment62036> it's a global thing like the enter or shift keysâ€¦ goes without saying <comment62041> it doesn't "go without saying" since it had to be said. I too wanted to know this. <comment64070> Weird/relevant: on older version of Microsoft Word, it used to be command instead of option. Took them _forever_ to get in line with the rest of Mac OS. <comment112923> That somehow contradicts the already accepted answer <comment242271> If you're using windows keyboard Alt + Left/Right <comment242273> @mahemadhi The question has the answer for windows. <comment242274> @KitSunde I am using windows keyboard with Mac OSX. So to be precise its alt key
