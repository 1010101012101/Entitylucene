How can I use option 5 as a spaces keyboard shortcut? <body> I have the following set on my keyboard shortcuts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MKUio.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, my kbdoption/kbdkbd5/kbd shortcut no longer works, because it prints âˆž in most of my applications.  This was working prior to a system reboot, however. Which is confusing.  Is there something I need to do in order to get it to work again to respect the shortcut at the OS level?  <comment337218> Do you have a 'short' or extended keyboard? The key commands consider the numbers above qwerty & those on the 10-key as different keys... yet you cannot tell which is set from that prefs panel. Default is 'above qwerty' <comment337392> @Tetsujin I have been setting it using the keys I plan on using for the shortcut. <comment337393> That may be why the default is to use Ctrl... because it doesn't map to an actual letter
