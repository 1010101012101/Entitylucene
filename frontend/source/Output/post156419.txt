Also when i trying to delete Downloads, OSX required password and then said emThe operation canâ€™t be completed because an unexpected error occurred (error code -8003)./em  Screenshots: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rve5o.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c4e7Y.png" alt="enter image descriptionhere"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YD3Lz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Of course, first of all I disabled FTP and rebooted computer. It didn't helped. I google the problem and found a solution, it says i would need perform couple command in terminal:  precodesudo chmod -R 755 /Users/evlogii/Downloads sudo chown -R evlogii:staff /Users/evlogii/Downloads /code/pre  As you understand "evlogii" is my username. It performed without any errors but didn't helped. Please help me recover normal condition of my Downloads folder.  <answer168572> I have encountered this problem before, on the Downloads folder, and on other folders.

The commands below are to be entered in the Terminal  Copy content before deleting:  codemkdir ~/Temp sudo cp -R  ~/Downloads ~/Temp/ sudo chmod -R 755  ~/Temp  /code  To remove your damaged Downloads folder:  coderm -rf ~/Downloads/code, or if that doesn't work, codesudo rm -rf ~/Downloads/code  To recreate a new empty one after removal:  codemkdir ~/Downloads; chown $USER ~/Downloads/code
