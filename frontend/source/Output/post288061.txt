I can't reinstall Windows 7 via Bootcamp after trying to use Windows 10 <body> I was running Windows 7 originally and it was working fine until I installed Windows 10. So I wanted to go back to Windows 7, but when I tried installing it again, it failed.  The Windows set up freezes and there was no way I could press kbdenter/kbd to continue. I do have the original disk that came with it.  strongThe Apple side of things is working fine, so I'm wondering if I can format the Bootcamp partition from within macOS?/strong   Or is there another solution I should try instead?
