MySQL service is grey under Server Admin <body> We just made a fresh install of Mac OSX Server 10.6.7, but the MySQL service doesn't seem to work, which is strange as its a fresh install!  I open Server Admin, and under Services, the MySQL service has a grey circle.  AFP, FTP and Web are all green.  If I uncheck the MySQL box in Settings, it rechecks itself within a few seconds.  Clicking on the MySQL service on the LHS yeilds:  precode**The service has encountered an error.** Try to refresh the view (workwork/MySQL). (NIL_RESPONSE_ERR (*** -[NSCFDictionary setObject:forKey:]: attempt to insert nil value (key: startTime))) MySQL /code/pre  (that popup appears twice, then)  precode**The service "MySQL" is unreachable** Try to reconnect to workwork (a back-end component may be missing). /code/pre  I can open Terminal, run codemysql/code, and that opens a mysql prompt.  I've also tried opening MySQL Workbench, "New Server Instance" under Server Administration, pick localhost, take the default values, and get a:  precode**Could not connect to MySQL server:** Lost connection to MySQL server at 'reading initial communication packet', system error: 61 You may continue if the server is simply not running. /code/pre  Again, this is a fresh install, so its very strange.  <answer18952> The plist which serverAdmin uses to store the status of the service is missing some keys.  take a look at /Library/Preferences/com.apple.MySQLService.plist  it should look like:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;activeDBPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/mysql&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;selectedDBPath&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/var/mysql&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;serviceRunning&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;serviceStart&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;date&gt;2011-07-27T14:24:23Z&lt;/date&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Probably yours is missing the serviceStart key  I've had this happen before, though I don't know why.
