Connect New MacBook 2017 (USB-C) to Apple Cinema Display 30" (DVI) <body> I have seen that the question has been already done, but all answers refer to 2016 MacBook Pro model, meanwhile I own a 2017.  picciano found a solution (see Connect New MacBook (USB-C) to Apple Cinema Display 30" (DVI)) but is working with this model? Has anybody tried it and had real experience?  <comment363932> Hi pitone78, just letting you know that the only difference between the 2016 and 2017 models of the MacBook Pro is a processor upgrade. Everything that worked for the 2016 MBP will work the same on the 2017. Thanks! <comment363935> Hi Jackson1442, thanks for your answer, the problem is that the brand of https://www.amazon.com/dp/B017TZTMBG/?tag=stackoverfl08-20 advices that it was not tested on 2017 model and I wanted to know if somebody here tried it. Thanks anyway! <comment363936> all usb-c items should work with both. <comment364001> Not a duplicate of the MacBook question.  The MacBook Pro has thunderbolt 3 in addition to usb c. That opens up many more display options like thunderbolt docks and such. <comment364035> There is no reason whatsoever that the adapters that work on the 2016 MBP won't work on the 2017 model.  The 2016 has USB 3.1 and DisplayPort support; the 2017 model adds Thunderbolt (which is PCIe).  USB and DisplayPort functionality and compatibility doesn't change from machine to machine and even if they do *upgrade* them, those standards are backward compatible.
