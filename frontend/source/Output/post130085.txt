Why isn't my launchctl.plst firing on startup? <body> I created this plist to get Mongo running on startup but it won't fire. I have to run this every time I start up:  precodelaunchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongo.mongod.plist /code/pre  Then it works fine.   Here is /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongo.mongod.plist  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;org.mongo.mongod&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mongo/bin/mongod&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;--config=/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Thanks  strongEDIT:/strong Here is the contents of system.log  precode$ cat /var/log/system.log | grep launch May  8 06:43:57 localhost com.apple.launchd[1]: *** launchd[1] has started up. *** May  8 06:43:57 localhost com.apple.launchd[1]: *** Shutdown logging is enabled. *** May  8 06:44:06 localhost com.apple.launchd[1] (nginx): Unknown key for boolean: NetworkState May  8 06:44:15 localhost distnoted[67]: assertion failed: 13C1021: liblaunch.dylib + 25164 [38D1AB2C-A476-385F-8EA8-7AB604CA1F89]: 0x25 May  8 06:44:23 Jonahs-iMac.local aosnotifyd[64]: aosnotifyd has been launched May  8 06:44:39 jonahs-imac com.apple.launchd[1] (0x7fc812f1c4c0.anonymous.nohup[212]): assertion failed: 13C1021: launchd + 73282 [425516B6-9F3E-342F-87B3-EC461EBA6A1A]: 0x0 May  8 06:44:39 jonahs-imac com.apple.launchd[1] (0x7fc812f1c4c0.anonymous.nohup[212]): Switching sessions is not allowed in the system Mach bootstrap.

Instead of writing it in this way:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mongo/bin/mongod&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;--config=/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  You have to write code--config/code and code/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf/code in each discrete line, such as:  precode&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mongo/bin/mongod&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;--config&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  And remember that when you modify your .plist file, you first have to unload it and then load it again in order to activate the launchd.  <answer224529> I solved this problem by running Adobe Application Manager.  <comment152342> Is there any related entry in `system.log`? <comment152345> Where would I find that? <comment152347> This is probably a stupid question, but is the path of that config file correct? It looks a little odd that mongod is in `/usr/local/mongo/bin` but the config file is in `/usr/local/etc`? Only asking because I can't see anything *obviously* wrong with the plist file. <comment152359> See `/var/log/system.log`, or run `sudo grep launch /var/log/system.log` directly from Terminal <comment152367> @mjturner just ran `$ cat /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf` to be sure and the config file prints out. <comment152369> @patrix I added system.log to the post. Don't see any mongo errors though. <comment152372> By issuing `launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongo.mongod.plist` you load the job into the user launchd instance but at boot time the job is loaded into the system launchd instance. Enter `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.mongo.mongod.plist` to find out why this fails. <comment152419> According to GNU getopt(3) he should be fine: A long option may take a parameter, of the form `--arg=param` or `--arg param`. <comment152429> Ya, I have tried it both was; neither successfully. <comment152430> @LCC when I use `sudo` it outputs `nothing found to load`. Any ideas? <comment152436> @jwerre: Nothing else? The interesting bit should be in the previous line. I think [LaunchControl](http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl) (a launchd troubleshooting tool) will tell you what exactly is wrong.
