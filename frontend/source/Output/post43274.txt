Will I lose my messages if I downgrade my iPhone from iOS 5 to iOS 4? <body> I have found some resources on how to downgrade my iPhone 3GS from 5.0.1 to 4.3.3. I have saved the required SHSH blobs so I am ready to proceed.  I have a question though - if I do downgrade, will I be able to keep my SMS messages?br Will I be able to restore a backup done on the iOS 5?  <answer43624> Yes, without a doubt. Unlike with the new ability to update only changes to the OS with iOS 5 delta updates, downgrading your OS will require you to restore the phone. Which essentially reformats the drive.  <comment49582> Sorry, I am not sure I clearly understood your answer. Will I lose my messages or be able to keep (restore) them? <comment60056> @Xavier under normal circumstances restoring will copy your messages back to the phone but during a downgrade it's very possible that iOS 4 won't be able to restore an iOS 5 backup. <comment60059> I can confirm that, I have downgraded and couldn't restore the backup - so messages are lost. It may be possible to restore them manually by digging into the iPhone files/SQLite database but I haven't tried that. <comment60060> Good call, good luck!
