Allow applications downloaded from anywhere in macOS Sierra <body> In previous versions of the OS in the security pane, you are provided an option of:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pvgm5.jpg" alt=""  But in this version there is no option anywhere:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wosP7.png" alt=""  Is there a way that I can turn on anywhere? (via Terminal maybe?)  <answer243689> You can open those files with Seconday Click (Right Click or kbd⌃CTRL/kbd+Click) in strongFinder/strong and choosing codeopen/code.   Right now (10.12 Beta (16A294a)) - there is no check box to add an strongAnywhere/strong option back in the preferences.   <answer243702> strongGatekeeper options are redesigned by Apple for Sierra./strong  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/706/?time=1339/li /ul  What it comes down to is that Apple is removing the "Install from Anywhere" option for the "general user" or the masses of people that are emnot/em power users.  However as already answered by user Mateusz Szlosek, you can still open unsigned apps via Finder by right clicking (kbdCtrl/kbd clicking) on the Application and selecting emOpen/em.  <answer245029> Apple have removed this function on macOS Sierra, but you can re-enable it running this in terminal:  precodesudo spctl --master-disable  /code/pre  hr  Additionally, as Jack points out:     Granted this is a little overkill, but it does the job reliably. It can be re-enabled immediately after launching the application with   precodesudo spctl --master-enable /code/pre   <answer253943>    OS X improves download validation by providing file quarantine in applications that download files from the Internet. This means that downloads are checked for safety (known malware) when you try to open them.   You can check an app (or any file) in quarantine using terminal. It's literally an extended file system attribute:  precodemac:~ user$ xattr /Applications/Some.app com.apple.quarantine mac:~ user$ /code/pre  If you're absolutely sure it's safe to run the app, you can drop the attribute like follows (you'll be asked to provide your password):  precodemac:~ user$ sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Some.app /code/pre  Check once again:  precodemac:~ user$ xattr /Applications/Some.app mac:~ user$ /code/pre  Now you should be able to run the app.  <answer266838> strongIf the app was extracted from an archive, it might be your archive extraction utility./strong  After checking out the other answers found here, none of them were working for me.  Eventually I realized the issue was my archive extraction utility (Keka 1.0.6) was silently failing to extract the app from its .zip file, and even though the app looked intact with the correct icon and everything, it was failing to read the package contents and would throw up a generic error message:     codeThe application “AppNameHere.app” can’t be opened./code   I swapped back over to using the built-in "Archive Utility.app" and everything went smoothly after that. So if codesudo spctl --master-disable/code doesn't work and codexattr/code shows the file isn't quarantined, try a different extractor utility.  <comment303366> this does not work where the bundle is signed but the signature fails validation <comment303367> Granted this is a little overkill, but it does the job reliably. It can be re-enabled immediately after launching the application with `sudo spctl --master-enable` <comment310068> Comments are not for extended discussion; this conversation has been [moved to chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/44191/discussion-on-question-by-samayres1992-macos-sierra-allow-applications-download). <comment315949> Works like a charm. Even brought back the "Anywhere" radio button in the Preference Pane. <comment316667> Thanks for pointing this neat utility out to me. Oddly enough, playing with it says that all applications are "rejected", even e.g. /Applications/Calendar.app. I wonder if it's not yet fully functional in Yosemite. Seems to work fine on El Capitan. <comment327842> Did NOT work on 10.12.1 for an installer... still had to approve it in the security control panel. <comment341125> This should be the accepted answer <comment365062> Thanks, this worked perfectly!
