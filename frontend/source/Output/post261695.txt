New MBP with Sierra, /usr/local/bin no longer accessible unless root <body> I just got a brand new MBP with a fresh macOS Sierra install. I installed Elm, which simply puts 5 files in code/usr/local/bin/code. However, when I try to run any of those files, they aren't found:  precodeScotts-MacBook-Pro:~ scott$ elm-make --version -bash: elm-make: command not found /code/pre  I search for them in code/usr/local/bin/code and I don't have permission:  precodeScotts-MacBook-Pro:~ scott$ ls -lh /usr/local/bin ls: bin: Permission denied /code/pre  I have to use codesudo/code and I see they are all owned by coderoot:wheel/code:  precodeScotts-MacBook-Pro:~ scott$ sudo ls -lh /usr/local/bin Password: total 85536 -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   2.0M Nov 10 18:46 elm -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    15M Nov 10 18:46 elm-make -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    11M Nov 10 18:46 elm-package -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   7.2M Nov 10 18:46 elm-reactor -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   7.0M Nov 10 18:46 elm-repl /code/pre  I can list the contents of code/usr/local/code without being coderoot/code:  precodeScotts-MacBook-Pro:~ scott$ ls -lh /usr/local total 0 drwx------  7 root  wheel   238B Nov 19 22:33 bin /code/pre  I just migrated from a MacBook with macOS Sierra also and code/usr/local/bin/code was accessible from my user account. Elm assumes that to be the case on all Macs.  Why was this changed? What should I do? Are we not supposed to use code/usr/local/bin/code like this anymore? Should I change permissions on code/usr/local/bin/code? I assume there's a reason code/usr/local/bin/code has been changed in this way... Should I move the Elm files to code/usr/bin/code?  <answer261710> In my almost default install of macOS (10.12.0  updated to 10.12.1) the directories have the following owners and permissions:  precodedrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel  sunlnk            136 Oct  2 22:42 . #/usr/local drwxr-xr-x@ 13 root  wheel  restricted,hidden 442 Oct  3 01:01 .. #/usr     com.apple.FinderInfo     32      com.apple.rootless    0  drwxr-xr-x  26 root  wheel  -                 884 Oct 17 03:36 bin drwxr-xr-x   5 root  wheel  -                 170 Oct 17 03:35 share /code/pre  There is no obvious reason why the permissions are set that tight - Apple explicitly states that third-party apps and installers can continue to write to /usr/local. If a normal user wouldn't be able to read or execute files there, the directory would miss its point.  So simply change the permissions of /usr/local/bin (and /usr/local if necessary) to 755.
