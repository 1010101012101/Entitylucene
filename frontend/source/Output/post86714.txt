How can I debug a series of piped commands in zsh? <body> The command   precodeioreg -lw0 | grep \"EDID\" | sed "/[^&lt;]*&lt;/s///" | xxd -p -r | strings -6 /code/pre  is not giving any result. Can any one help.  I got this command from an article that maintains (I paraphrase) emthat rMBP can have Samsung / LG screens,  and that the LG screens are all defective./em  My MacBook Pro retina 13" so I naturally wanted to check the details of my hardware. Mine is zsh  <answer86717> One way to debug command-line pipes is to insert code| tee debug.txt/code between two steps and look at the file codedebug.txt/code to check whether the previous steps are correct.  <answer86751> Another way to debug pipes is to add each element in sequence until you have a problem. For example, start with  precodeioreg -lw0 | grep \"EDID\" /code/pre  which outputs nothing. That means there is no string code"EDID"/code output by ioreg. So there's the problem.  But hey, I don't like seeing a problem unsolved: let's simplify a little more by getting rid of the quotation marks. I assume your Mac is like mine.  precodeioreg -lw0 | grep EDID /code/pre  matches a string codeIODisplayEDID/code. Substituting codeIODisplayEDID/code for codeEDID/code in the codegrep/code argument succeeds. Don't forget to "escape" the quotes with a backslash (or, in this case, you can omit the quotes and get the same result).  <comment100233> Your question could use some work. Please clarify what you are trying to accomplish instead of just linking to an external site. <comment100234> The command in the linked article is different than the one you've included above. <comment100235> @patrix They command is having some escape characters issue with SO's escaping characters. <comment100236> As your question is more about the non-working shell pipeline than the Retina topic, I've changed the title accordingly. <comment100237> Can you please add the output of `ioreg -lw0 | grep \"EDID\"` to the question? <comment100245> This is a great way to debug things. In your case, you want to grep for `IODisplayEDID` as opposed to `\"EDID\"` so that you get the string output from the ioreg input.
