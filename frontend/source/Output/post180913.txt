In iTerm, how can I change alt+delete to ignore slashes? <body> I set up my iTerm to work a lot like OSX does in other text fields, eg kbd⌘ Command/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd = codedelete line backward/code, kbd⌥ Option/kbd+left arrow = "move cursor back one word" and kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd = codedelete word backward/code, but the way I have it, kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd in bash/iTerm doesn't count code//code as a word separator, so if I have codecd a/path/to/a/folder/code and I hit kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd it deletes the whole path, instead of just codefolder/code.  How can I set it up so that kbd⌥ Option/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd only gets rid of folder? I realize this might need a bash solution, or an iTerm solution, but I don't know which. Or maybe it needs both.  <answer223669> In order to get this to work, in iTerm preferences I had to set the key alt+backspace (or w/e you have it as) to map to these hex codes:  precode0x1B 0x08 /code/pre
