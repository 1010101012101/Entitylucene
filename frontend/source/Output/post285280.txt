Install Adblock on iPad <body> I have an iPad 3 with iOS 8.3; I wonder if there is some software/tool that allows  to install Adblock and how to enable it on Safari (if I can of course).  <answer285281> There are apps which aren't content blockers, but which rather install a VPN on your device and route your traffic through this to block ads. This is still supported on devices which don't support content blockers.  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlhdA.jpg" width="32" AdBlock/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b7K8z.jpg" width="32" AdGuard/li /ul  hr  For other devices which do support content blockers on iOS 9, there are many options available.  ul liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XBVuH.jpg" width="32" Crystal/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nhEnJ.jpg" width="32" AdBlock Plus/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8lML.jpg" width="32" Aqua/li liimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Aqmr.jpg" width="32" AdBlock for Mobile/li /ul  To add a content blocker, install it from the App Store, then choose Settings → Safari → Content Blockers and enable the content blocker. For apps which do not use content blockers, see the app itself for installation instructions.  <comment359724> I use something called [Adguard Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adguard-pro-adblock-and-privacy-protection/id1126386264?mt=8) on my iPhone/iPad. It requires a minimum of iOS 9, though, which your iPad 3 can run. <comment359746> Safari content blockers require a device with a 64-bit SoC, of which the iPad 3 isn’t. So fake-VPN apps, and third-party browsers with built-in ad-blockers seem like the only solutions. <comment359747> @Phong Thanks, edited my answer, I should have remembered this since I have an iPad 2 with iOS 9 but no content blockers!
