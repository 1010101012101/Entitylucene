Getting music off an ipad into the computer <body> I just bought a new ipad, and need to move everything from the old one (an ipad 1) to the new one. I made a sync to the computer. Then made a restore to the new ipad. And then I found it did not copy over my music. Some of those music files are not in my HD anymore. So if I lose it it might be gone for good. Is there any way in which I can get them out of the iPad in my HD memory.  <answer48598> PhoneView (for Mac), PhoneDisk (Windows or Mac), iExplorer (Windows and Mac, free, but you have to find where the music is)  <answer48600> SaveTunes allows to extract audio files directly on the iDevice.  <comment55660> Thanks, Phoneview made the trick. Phonedisk seemed ok until I realized that the data was given without any metadata.
