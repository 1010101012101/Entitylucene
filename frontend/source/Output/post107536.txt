I can't create a bootable OSX Mavericks Install USB Drive <body> I've downloaded Mavericks from the App Store, repartitioned a 32GB USB key, and followed the instructions. Specifically, I ran:  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app /code/pre  Here's the output. As you can see, it fails with an error:  precodeReady to start. To continue we need to erase the disk at /Volumes/Untitled. If you wish to continue type (Y) then press return: Y Erasing Disk: 0%... 10%... 20%...100%... Copying installer files to disk... Copy complete. Making disk bootable... Couldn't mount dmg /Volumes/Install OS X Mavericks/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg (error code 112)Mount of outer dmg failed. Done. /code/pre  Help?  <answer107645> It turns out that the Installer Image did not download correctly. To address this I deleted "Install OSX Mavericks" from the Applications folder and then re-downloaded it from the App Store.   <answer162493> I had the same problem with a 16Gb USB.  I tried it twice. First time I got error 112, and then an error 110 when I tried again.  I was about to download it again, but I tried a different USB 16Gb, and it worked with the same app file.  So my tip, before you go downloading it again, try another USB brand.  <answer197099> its important to know that you have to close the finder windows and the disk utility or any program that might be using the ElCapInstaller flash drive, because if they are being used you, this is what happens:  Copying installer files to disk... Copy complete. Making disk bootable... Mount of outer dmg failed. Done.  and you want this to happen  Copy complete. Making disk bootable... Copying boot files... Copy complete. Done.  <answer197318> Close the "Disk Utility.app" and the "Finder" before execute the command. It works for me! :)  <answer229872> I had same problem and when I ran:  precodehdiutil verify /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg /code/pre  On the usb, I got  precodeChecksumming Protective Master Boot Record (MBR : 0)â€¦ Protective Master Boot Record (MBR :: checksum failed with error 1000. ............................................................................................................................................................... calculated CRC32 $00000000, expected   CRC32 $BE5D6293 hdiutil: verify: checksum of "Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg" is INVALID hdiutil: verify failed - image data corrupted /code/pre  So the error can be either on the installation or the thumb drive itself (bad drive).  <comment126119> What instructions are you following? <comment126122> Post the command you used to create the installer. If you just copied the installer into the USB drive it wont work. <comment126178> "Repartitioned a 32GB USB key..." - what partitions do you have? <comment126197> That sounds a bit like a damaged disk image. Try running `hdiutil verify /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg` (and if that doesn't find a problem, try running it on the copy on the USB drive -- the path mentioned in the error message). <comment126214> @GordonDavisson thanks; here's what happens when I try hdiutil: `hdiutil: verify: "/Applications/Install OS X Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg" has no checksum.` <comment126216> @BobbyAlexander I was following [Apple's instructions](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5856) <comment126218> @MK it's a 32GB USB Stick with a single Mac OS Extended (Journaled) partition that's 30.82GB in size. <comment235979> How do you close Finder? <comment236193> I mean just to close opened Finder's windows.
