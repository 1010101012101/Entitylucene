Problems with Wifi when multiple devices are connecting to same Wifi spot <body> Since updating my Macbook Pro's OS X to 10.10 I'm experiencing problems with my WiFi connection. Sometimes it works great, sometimes it's super slow. Today I found out that the problem also seems related to an other device that's connecting to the same Wifi AP.  When the other Macbook Pro connects to the same AP, my Wifi get's squeezed to the point that our 30/30 Mbit connection only gives me about 0.2 / 0.2 Mbit. The other Macbook does achieve maximum bandwidth. Another strange thing is that it seems dependant of the distance to the AP. When we switch places so that I'm closer to the AP it works the other way around (I get max bandwidth, he only gets 0.2/ 0.2 Mbit).  Strange and very annoying since everytime one of us can't work with a proper connection.  We've already tried disabling bluetooth (which is the advise in some other questions). Any ideas on troubleshooting this?
