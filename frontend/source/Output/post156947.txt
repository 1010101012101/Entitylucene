Shared calendar notification only works one way <body> My wife and I have a shared calendar set up. When she adds, deletes, or changes events, I get a notification, as expected. However when I do the same, she gets no notification. The changes still propagate to her phone, but it happens silently and she doesn't get notified.  We both have codeShared Calendar Alerts/code enabled in codeMail, Contacts, Calendars/code in codeSettings/code.  She has an iPhone 5 and I have an iPhone 5S, both running iOS 7.1.2.  h2Update/h2  Here are some other things I tried without success:  ul liToggling the codeShared Calendar Alerts/code settings/li liRestarting the phone/li liChecking settings in iCloud/li liTried changing the default alert time, as described here: http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-fix-calendar-alerts-not-working-on-iphone-in-ios-7//li liTried deleting other calendar apps/li /ul  Still no joy.
