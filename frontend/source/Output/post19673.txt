Release. This boots you into Recovery.  3.From the Utilities menu, select Terminal.  4.At the prompt type exactly the following and then press Return: codecsrutil disable/code  5.Terminal should display a message that SIP was disabled.  6.From the ï£¿ menu, select Restart.  <comment21610> Would a program like CandyBar suit your needs? http://www.panic.com/candybar/ <comment21611> It does not state if it can change them in the sidebar. Can anyone vouch for that functionality? <comment21964> I'll have to check it out! <comment22093> I downloaded a trial of candy bar from macupdate. It did not change the sidebar icons to color. <comment22207> Hmmm...it should. I don't exactly know. It may be that the trial doesn't let you do that. <comment133998> They have released a serial code to use it for free  now.
