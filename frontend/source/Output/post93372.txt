Make backup of Time Machine volume on Time Capsule <body> I have two laptops that back up via Time Machine to a Time Capsule. The shared volume on the Time Capsule contains two .sparsebundle files.  Can I copy those .sparsebundle files to an external hard disk and expect them to work as Time Machine backup resources again?  I usually send my Time Machine hard disks to a remote location every few months. With the Time Capsule I don't want to do that. That's whyt I want to copy the data and need to know whether I can still restore from it if I do.  <answer93387>    Can I copy those .sparsebundle files to an external hard disk and expect them to work as Time Machine backup resources again?   Almost certainly yes.  h2Modes and ownership/h2  Ideally, use codechmod/code(1) and codechown/code(8) to have the mode and ownership, of the copy of the disk image, consistent with how Mountain Lion normally creates a emlocal/em disk image for Time Machine.   h3Example/h3  precodeGPES3E-gjp4-1:~ gjp22$ sudo ls -al /Volumes/tall/com.apple.backupd/GPES3E-gjp4-1.sparsebundle/ Password: total 16672 drwx------@ 3 root   staff     10  7 Jun 19:07 . drwxr-xr-x  8 gjp22  staff     10  6 Jun 18:57 .. -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff    500  7 Jun 18:03 Info.bckup -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff    500  7 Jun 18:03 Info.plist drwx------  2 root   staff  78855  7 Jun 19:07 bands -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff    444  7 Jun 18:02 com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.bckup -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff    444  7 Jun 18:02 com.apple.TimeMachine.MachineID.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff   1473  6 Jun 21:28 com.apple.TimeMachine.Results.plist -rw-r--r--  1 root   staff  10698  6 Jun 22:24 com.apple.TimeMachine.SnapshotHistory.plist -rwx------  1 root   staff      0 19 Mar 19:36 token /code/pre  – and for each band, you should have:   precode-rw-------  1 root  staff  /code/pre  h3Attaching the copy of the disk image/h3  With Terminal, for the example above:  precodesudo hdiutil attach -readonly /Volumes/tall/com.apple.backupd/GPES3E-gjp4-1.sparsebundle/ /code/pre  If you use Terminal from within Recovery OS: you'll probably not need the codesudo/code prefix to the command.   hr  h2Additional detail/h2     … whether I can still restore …   You require:   ul lia copy of a Time Machine destination, a copy that will be good for restoration/li linot an additional Time Machine destination./li /ul  h2Assumption/h2  You wish the copy to be usable, for restoration only, in the event of strongloss or failure of the Time Capsule/strong.
