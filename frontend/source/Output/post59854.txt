How to get the path of the selected Image in Adobe Bridge via Applescript? <body> I am trying to get the parent file path of a selected image thumbnail in Adobe Bridge CS5.1 to pass it on to a shell script. An Applescript wraps a tiny javascript command in command like this:  precodeset js to "app.document.selections[0].spec.parent.name;" # parent of 1st selected image tell application "Adobe Bridge CS5.1" # target adobe product     set theResult to do javascript js # fire away, waiting for return value end tell  /code/pre  The javascript reports the correct value — I tested the output within Bridge via codealert/code. Alas, the codedo javascript/code command does emnot/em return any value, so I added an explicit codereturn/code statement:  codeset js to "return app.document.selections[0].spec.parent.name;"/code  throws an error in emAppleScript Editor.app/em:  codeerror "Adobe Bridge CS5.1 got an error: AppleEvent handler failed." number -10000/code  What am I doing wrong? NB: I just need the path, I don’t care about how it is done.  <answer59881> You can't use a codereturn/code in javascript, except in a function.  Updated : Ok, I did a test, if I put the result of the javascript command  into a javascript variable,  the result in AppleScript will be this string : strongundefined/strong  So, use this codeset js to "app.document.selections[0].parent.spec;"/code  <answer65495> I think you would have to go via Photoshop using BridgeTalk to get the path.  precodefunction getPathFromBridge(){     function script(){         var Path = new File(encodeURI(app.document.selections[0].spec.parent));          return Path.toSource();     }     var filePath='';     var bt = new BridgeTalk();     bt.target = "bridge";     bt.body ="var ftn = " + script.toSource() + "; ftn();";     bt.onResult = function( inBT ) { filePath = decodeURI(eval( inBT.body));}     bt.onError = function( inBT ) { filePath = '';}     bt.send(4);     if ( undefined == filePath ) filePath = '';     return decodeURI(filePath);  } /code/pre  <comment68911> Thank you for your answer! Unfortunately, I still get the `AppleEvent handler failed." number -10000` error. It’s driving me insane. <comment68932> It seems that the syntax is not correct. try this `set js to "tPath = app.document.selections[0].parent.spec;"`  --  Important, the parent property : The value is undefined for thumbnails added to the root level of app.favorites. <comment68948> You are right, syntax was incorrect. Thank you for the fix! Still no return from Bridge. Maybe the mechanism is broken? <comment68970> I updated my answer. <comment68974> Still no luck. Still empty return. But thank you so very much for your efforts! I will look into Adobe’s [Bridge Developer Center](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/bridge.html), perhaps there is a code snippet that helps. Will report back! <comment72869> @myhd: See my answer to your question on SO, but I agree that the functionality is broken (intentionally or otherwise) for Bridge. <comment91195> In the end, I feel that Adobe scripting can turn one insane.
