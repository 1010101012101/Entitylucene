How to stop the hidden __MACOSX folder from being created when compressing files/folders in Finder <body> When compressing files/folders in Finder, via the context menu, i.e. select the files/folders then right-click and select Compress ..., a hidden folder named __MACOSX is created within the zip archive.  How can the hidden folder named __MACOSX not be created within the zip archive?  <answer288569> From WP Guru - How to remove __MACOSX from zip archives     First, create your ZIP via the finder – like you always do. Next, open   Terminal and cd into the directory where your ZIP file is located. If   it’s a long path, just type “cd “, then drag the folder into Terminal   (less typing is always good).      Now type the following:      codezip -d your-archive.zip "__MACOSX*"/code        And that should do it. This   command (zip) will remove everything (-d) starting with __MACOSX from   your ZIP file (your-archive.zip).      To verify, type the following:      codeunzip -l your-archive.zip/code        This will simply list the contents of   your-archive.zip.   If you're not comfortable with Terminal, BetterZip has an option to do this for you, but it's $25.  <answer288606> Using info from the other answer, here's an strongAutomator Service/strong that becomes available in strongFinder/strong to delete the "__MACOSX" emmeta-data/em folder from a zip archive file.  strongTo Create the Service:/strong  ol liOpen strongAutomator/strong and select: strongFile/strong  strongNew/strong  strongService/strong/li liSet strongService receives selected/strong to strongfiles or folders/strong and strongin/strong to strongFinder/strong./li liAdd a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em, setting strongShell:/strong to strong/bin/bash/strong and strongPass input:/strong to strongas arguments/strong while replacing the default emcode/em with the following emcode/em:  precodefor f in "$@"; do     if [[ ${f##*.} =~ ^[zZ][iI][pP]$ ]]; then         zip -d "$f" "__MACOSX*"     fi done afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Purr.aiff /code/pre  ul liWhat the emcode/em does: It checks that each file passed to the service has a zip extension, regardless of case, and if it has a zip extension, and if "__MACOSX" exists within the zip archive, deletes the "__MACOSX" emmeta-data folder/em from the zip archive./li licode${f##*.}/code gets the file extension, code=~/code tests the emregex/em, and the code^[zZ][iI][pP]$/code emregex/em matches any case combination of each letter within the emsquare braces/em while code^/code asserts position at start of the string and code$/code asserts position at the end of the string. So it only matches codezip/code in any case combination of those letters./li liNote: The last line of the emcode/em is optional, just to let you know the service completed, and can be changed to a different sound or omitted if you prefer not to be notified by sound upon completion. /li /ul/li liSave the strongService/strong as, e.g.,: strongDelete '__MACOSX' from Zip Archive/strong/li /ol  strongTo Use the Service:/strong  In strongFinder/strong, or on the strongDesktop/strong if the zip archive is located there, select the zip archive(s), then strongright-click/strong and select strongDelete '__MACOSX' from Zip Archive/strong from the context menu or under strongServices/strong on the context menu, or from strongServices/strong on the strongFinder/strong emmenu/em as appropriate.  The image of the emservice/em in strongAutomator/strong, below, is from OS X 10.8.6, however, it was tested under macOS 10.12.5 and works there as well.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vN64V.png" alt="Automator Service"  <answer288608> Like user3439894 said, try third-party solution.  I'm using free application Keka with success, long term:  http://www.kekaosx.com/en/  Configure in Keka preferences to not create mac-specific files in archives. It can also be used via the context menu (after adding "Compress with Keka.workflow" to your "~/Library/Services" folder), see the link at the bottom left of their website.  <comment364404> Welcome to Ask Different. :) Unfortunately, your question doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Reading [how to ask a question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask) may improve your chances of getting a good answer. For now, can you please [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/288568/edit) your question to clarify what is actually happening. Specifically, can you expand on what you mean by a hidden folder being created? Is this located within the archive? Or do you mean you get nothing but an empty folder (i.e. nothing is being archived)? Or something else? <comment364407> I would like to totally disable this option. <comment364409> I doubt that's possible. The data is there for the OS to be able to correctly re-merge metadata that cannot be carried in the files otherwise. <comment364414> By default, files/folders compressed in Finder are proceeded using Archive Utility and this app does not have the setting preferences to keep meta-data from bring added to the archive. You'll have to use a third-party solution or other macOS built-in utilities/methods, i.e. using command line utilities like `ditto`, `zip` or creating an Automator Service to perform the actions necessary to achieve the goal, etc. <comment364431> What version of OS X/macOS are you using? <comment364455> +1 for Keka... simple, free and does the job. <comment364461> Well done. Would you mind me making an edit to explain why these folders properly exist when you encode HFS+ files or speculations that be better as it’s own answer? <comment364472> @bmike, Not at all, sounds like value added... thanks. <comment365024> Its Great. Thank you ii work. is it possible that service will compress and delete the files.  all in one click?
