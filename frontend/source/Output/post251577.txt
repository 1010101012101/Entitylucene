configure word-forward/word-backword in Iterm2 <body> I've read numerous articles about how to configure alt + left_arrow and alt + right_arrow to mode the cursor by one word on each direction.   the easiest way to do so is simply by adding shortcut in the key mappings page ( see pic below ). however, after i configure this i still produce code[C/code and code[D/code every time i try to move words.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jIm9K.png" alt="enter image description here"  any idea why I get this unexpected result.
