Increase size of sparsebundle for TimeMachine <body> I am using a sparsebundle store on a linux server. It worked well until today.   Today Time Machine tells me that the size of the sparsebundle (500gb) is not sufficient. So I use codehdiutil/code command for increasing the size of the sparsebundle: codehdiutil resize -size 600G xxx.sparsebundle/code. The command works fine but Time Machine seems to not see the increase of the size of the sparsebundle (it only sees that the size is 500gb and so it can't continue to backup).  Do you have any idea for solving this issue?

Just check if this value is not too low!!  In my case, I upgrade codenetatalk/code from the default ubuntu package (version 2.2) to the up to date version (3.1.7). During this upgrade I remembered that I have specified a low size limit....

At that point, I'd reboot the Mac and then set up Time Machine with the new mount. If you did some other setup, please edit that into the question. <comment193470> @bmike I just tested your proposal but nothing changed... The result is the same. <comment193471> @bmike You say "remove all backup destinations in the system preferences". Do you mean in Time Machine or in another place? <comment193472> Yes - On 10.10 the text is "Add or Remove Backup Disk..." or "Select Disk" if you have but one destination selected. Once the pref is "clean" you will be greeted with text "Select Backup Disk..." and Finder may prompt you to select disks as they mount. Also, edit in what `sw_vers` shows from terminal on your Mac. <comment193474> My guess exactly as to what might be causing it. Pondini is so awesome for advanced Time Machine users... <comment193495> I already followed this process but no success... <comment193497> Ok I did this but nothing change... It's really weird because when I display the content of the sparsebundle, I see in the file `Info.plist` the line size and the 600gb...
