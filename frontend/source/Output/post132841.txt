Can I clean install Mavericks preserving other bootable partitions (Ubuntu on ext4)? <body> I have checked Will my other partitions be wiped when doing a clean install of Mavericks? but I'd like to make sure whether a clean install of Mavericks to my specific OS X partition won't mess up with the rest of the disk. OS X generally doesn't recognize other partitions types beyond the Windows types.  Is such clean install prone to error even if I take care of asking installation to not touch the partition scheme?  <answer132858> If you clear you partition using Disk Utility and then boot into Internet Recovery or install from another location (for example a USB flash drive) you should be fine, OS X will only be installed (and only effect) the partition you choose to install it on at the start of the installation process.  <comment157434> does that means I have to first clear the partition before the clean install? or is it safe to just overwrite current installation if there's such option. <comment157438> It's how I choose to do it. You can just launch into the boot disk and it will overwrite it for you. <comment157443> thanks, I have already erased it first from disk utility in the Mavericks thumb drive <comment157478> ok, I was using [rEFInd](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html) already, it was a matter of reinstalling it after the clean install, no problems =D <comment157488> @pepper_chico Good!
