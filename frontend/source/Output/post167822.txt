Disable animation for "Swipe between full-screen apps"? <body> Mavericks (Mac OS X 10.9.5) and Yosemite (10.10) offer a mouse and trackpad gesture, emSwipe between full-screen apps/em. Works well as full-screen apps are treated like a emMission Control/em desktop.  ul liMagic Trackpad – Three finger swipe to the right or left./li liMagic Mouse – Two finger swipe to the right or left./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OhWul.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xivy9.png" alt="screen shot of System Preferences &gt; Mouse &gt; More Gestures &gt; &quot;Swipe between full-screen apps&quot; checkbox"  The problem is the animation of the full-screen app sliding to the left or right as the other app/desktop/space slides alongside it. All this sliding makes me dizzy or nauseous. Especially bad during presentations to an audience.  ➥ Any way to disable or alter this left/right sliding animation?  ➥ Is there some other way to switch between full-screen apps?  h1Between, Not Into, Full-Screen Apps/h1  This question is not a duplicate of questions such as this one that ask about disabling the animation eminto/em full-screen mode. My question is about the animation switching ("swiping") embetween/em full-screen app(s).  <answer219741> You can control the animation speed by not swiping your fingers as fast. The actual code is quite tightly coupled into the OS and there's been no signs of people finding a hidden setting to speed up or even change the animations.  You could also use mission control to have the screen animation come down from above if the nausea is caused by left-right visual motion.  Lastly, if you really need to control the motion, you might have to pre-record the screen and just speak to it. Keynote and editing the video would allow you to fade to black or use another transition idiom than a wipe.
