Free SSH GUI client with ssh tunnel support for Yosemite? <body> Is there any free SSH GUI client for Mac OS X? Coming from Windows I would be happy with something as simple as Putty.  Features:  ol liFree/li liConnection Manager/li liSSH tunnel support/li liYosemite ready (and retina pretty)/li liCurrently active (development not dead)/li liSupport for private key authentication/li /ol  I’m aware of similar questions posted here but I haven’t found a good alternative covering the requirements in items 2, 3, 4 and 5.  <answer187140> You may try iTerm2  precodesudo port install iterm2 /code/pre  or   precodebrew cask install iterm2 /code/pre  <answer187144> Most OS X users don't use "ssh GUIs" because OS X ships with a very good Terminal application. This is unlike Windows where the cmd.exe or even a PowerShell are not friendly command line interfaces to remote servers.  In OS X, you can just fire up Terminal.app and ssh from the command line with:  precodessh &lt;myhost&gt; /code/pre  You can use a more advanced terminal application like iTerm2 and it will allow you to save "profiles" that, when called up, automatically run a set of commands in the terminal for you. You can use these to automatically start ssh connections (which can be interactive terminal sessions or stunnels):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJCyM.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can start and stop stunnels from the command line as well -- after all, these are just ssh connections that open a local port and forward requests to a remote server. For example:  precodessh -f user@personal-server.com -L 2000:personal-server.com:25 -N /code/pre  And you're done.  Private key authentication schemes are supported by the ssh command line that ships, default, with any OS X version.  <comment205047> iTerm profiles can be set up covering  2 and 4 and ssh itself supports 3 and 6 Terminal.app itself does all these <comment205059> What Mark said. covered here as well. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/52096/is-there-a-gui-ssh-client-for-os-x/52101#52101 <comment221147> Once you have sufficient reputation, please put suggestions and clarifications into a comment.
