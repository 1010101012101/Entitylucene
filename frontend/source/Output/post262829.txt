Ipad 4 Screen Black after touchscreen repair <body> I recently replaced the touchscreen on my iPad 4.  It was cracked but still working, no other problems.  Before sealing it back up I checked to be sure all was working and found that the picture is not working.  I tried to restart holding down power and home but that didn't work.  It shows up when plugged into computer. Also it makes the normal sound when plugging in the power cord.  All four of my alarms are still going off and I think I'm only snoozing them by switching the mute button off and on.  I'm disabled and other than doctors appointments am at home all day trying to homeschooled my oldest son (home this year due to his medical problems) and I never realized how much I need this stinking iPad.  I have no idea when our appointments are this week, if the alarms weren't still going off I'd no doubt sleep past getting my little one up and on the bus in the morning and lose track off taking my meds.  I haven't yet emailed my attempt at this weeks lesson plan and ya know what else I'm just plain bored out of my mind just now.  I have got to get this bugger fixed.  Tmi I know but just I need help, please.
