iTunes store / Books / Column browser <body> If I go to the emBooks/em section of the iTunes store, I see the emColumn browser/em:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LlMAY.png" alt="Column Browser"  If i try to go back to the standard view (my Command+B or using the menu "View" - "Column Browser" - "Hide Column Browser" I am redirected to the main store page. If I click back on books in the top bar, I get the books section again in emColumn browser/em mode.  How can I get rid of it?  If I do not choose the "Books" section, but instead I click on the small down-arrow near "Books" and choose a section. I get the usual view with the covers and so on.  <answer46181> I do not experience the problem anymore. I am now getting a normal/usual view. Since I didn't notice when it was fixed it is difficult to say if it was a bug or an issue with the Swiss iTunes store.  <comment30088> Same here, seems to be the standard behaviour for Books <comment37198> It seems that it was fixed by one of the last updates. <comment52699> @Matteo - You can answer your own question with something along the lines of "this seems to have been a bug"?  Or is there still a problem?
