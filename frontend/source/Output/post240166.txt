OS X El Capitan won't work and is not recognized on UniBeast <body> I have been trying to download the new version of El Capitan and use UniBeast to create a bootable USB. However, every time I download El Capitan from the App Store, it takes 2 hours to download the 6 GB content.  The MacBook restarts and everything, but when I open it in the App Store, it gives me the option of downloading it again, as if I never downloaded it. The UniBeast can't find the El Capitan either.   <answer240169> The officially supported way to create a USB OS X Installer, for OS X Mavericks and later, is to use codecreateinstallmedia/code from within the downloaded installer application bundle.  Have a look at: Create a bootable installer for OS X  The following is from the link above:     Use the 'createinstallmedia' command in Terminal      ol   liDownload the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer   will be in your Applications folder./li   liMount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition./li   liOpen the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder./li   liUse the createinstallmedia command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next section.   For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate   Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then enter one of the   following paths in Terminal:/li   /ol      Path for El Capitan:  precode/Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia /code/pre      Examples      This is the basic syntax of the command. Replace codevolumepath/code with   the path to your USB flash drive or other volume, and replace   codeinstallerpath/code with the path to the Install OS X app.   precodecreateinstallmedia --volume volumepath --applicationpath installerpath /code/pre      The following examples assume that the OS X installer is in your   Applications folder and the name of your USB flash drive or other   volume is MyVolume:      Example for El Capitan:  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app /code/pre   Note: You can substitute codeMavericks/code or codeYosemite/code for codeEl\ Capitan/code in the above command examples.
