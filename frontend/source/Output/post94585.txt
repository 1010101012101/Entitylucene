iPod 5 charger isn't working! What do I do? <body> I have A ipod 5. Every time I go to charge it with a dynex or apple charger it doesn't charge. The bar stays red for over an hour. I'm thinking that I have a short in my charger. I don't know what to do. Please help?  <answer94594> Without knowing if your charge is dead, try using a USB cable connected to your Mac, to charge it that way.     To charge iPod, connect it directly to a computer's USB port (not a   keyboard) and make sure standby, hibernation, or sleep mode is turned   off. Important: iPod will stop charging if the computer it's connected   to enters standby, hibernation, or sleep mode.   If you have a volt meter then check the pins of the cable coming out of the charger.  <comment110881> I meant to say I don't know what to do please help <comment110882> Did you tried using only the USB cable (without the power adapter) ? <comment169461> I know right that is exactly what is happening to me.
