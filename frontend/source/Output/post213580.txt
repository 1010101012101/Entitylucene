Disconnect external HD when installing El Capitan upgrade? <body> I use an external HD with Time Machine to back up data.br Should I disconnect external HD before installing/upgrading to El Capitan?  <answer213583> Quick answer: No, you shouldn't have to, as long as you don't select to install to it during the upgrade process.  It shouldn't hurt to disconnect it though, if you want to.  <answer213621> For full belt &amp; braces backup protection, I always remove my Time Machine drive right before a major update &amp; replace it with a new one.  That way, if you have major issues with the new OS - incompatible drivers with no updates yet, etc - you have a 'restore point' to return to.  I also make a clone of the boot partition &amp; I have a full Backblaze backup of everything too.br You might consider that paranoid overkill, but I haven't lost a file since the mid 90's ;-)  <comment257836> Welcome to Ask Different. By backing up, do you mean with Time Machine? <comment257837> yes (time machine) <comment257846> I would recommend doing it. If something goes wrong, it's better to be safe then sorry. <comment257848> Of course, always air on the side of caution (unless you like learning things the hard way).
