How can I add an Automator application to the Dock? <body> I followed the directions in How to put a custom launcher in the Dock (Mavericks) but my case has a different twist. I have an Automator application which runs a shell script that (1) changes the stack size with codeulimit/code and (2) runs an application. I would like to add this to the Dock. I can run it from the Launchpad and everything works correctly. It shows up in my Dock, but only as the application, not the Automator version. As a result, if I right click and enable 'Keep in Dock', then close and run again, the stack limit change of (1) is ignored. How do I put an icon in the Dock which runs the Automator application and not just the application?  <answer188054> Just drag and drop the app_name.app bundle created in Automator onto the Dock where you want it.  <comment222469> I need to clarify, when I said _"...drag and drop the Automator.app bundle onto the Dock..."_ I didn't mean the actual "/Applications/Automator.app" bundle but the .app bundle created in Automator.  I've edited the answer to reflect the comment. <comment282859> hrm, i only see a `.action` file, not a `.app` file...  ? <comment339844> But it still shows the active indicator under the original app, not the Automator version. This also means that I cannot run both the original app and the Automator version simultaneously.
