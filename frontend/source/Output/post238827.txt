Why can I no longer remove mails? <body> In one of my mailboxes, I can no longer remove e-mails. Every time I want to delete a mail, it gives me the following message:     "247263.emlx" couldn't be copied to "Messages" because an item with the same name already exists.   I have already tried to rebuild the mailbox, but without any result.  How can I fix this issue?  em(MacBook Pro Retina, Mid 2012, OS X 10.11.4)/em  <comment293415> Are you using pop3 or imap4 <comment293416> I am using IMAP. <comment293417> How full is your "deleted" folder <comment293419> I have 2581 in the Thrash folder and 5626 in the Archive folder. <comment293445> Try deleting some and sorry for the late reply I only just got the notification....
