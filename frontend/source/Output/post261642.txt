Sharing Contact documentation <body> I've just recently discovered that the "Notes" field of a contact isn't sent when a contact is shared.     In the past I've always been careful to check notes and remove them before sending a contact to some one else. (Formerly I would "cut", "send", and "paste" the note back.)  Since my random accidental discovery, I've searched apple.com several times looking for official documentation that says the "notes" field is intentionally omitted.  My fear being that Apple might suddenly fix a bug and then I'll end up sharing a note that I didn't intend.    I can find many emuser/em postings online, but nothing "officially Apple" that says this is how send contact works and this is what's sent and not sent.  The question:. Is feature of not sending the "notes" field when a contact is shared officially documented by Apple?  While asking two questions here isn't officially supported, they are so closely related it doesn't make sense to ask this as another question: Is "notes" the only contact field not sent?
