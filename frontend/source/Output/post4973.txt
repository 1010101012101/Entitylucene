In Activity Monitor, how can Swap Used be more than Page Outs? <body> I am trying to understand the relationship between Page Outs and Swap Used as displayed in Activity Monitor.  Currently, Activity Monitor shows:  Page outs:  1.6 MB Swap used:  8.1 MB  How can there be more swap used than the amount paged out?  <answer4994> My understanding is this:  ul liProgram needs access to some data.  Attempts to do so, and fails, due to lack of RAM./li liOS takes control.  There is a page-out operation, where physical RAM is copied to swap./li liThere is a page-in operation, where the required data is copied to RAM./li liOS gives control back to program./li liProgram tries again, finds its data./li /ul  OS's are getting smart about how they choose what and when to to page in/out.  So the operation counts may not be the same, and the swap space may perhaps be in use without there being page outs.  Unless of course I'm backwards on what a page-in/page-out operation is.  In which case your question makes perfect sense.  <comment5026> Does not directly address your question (only explains why page out can be much higher than swap), but the two numbers are not comparable, Swap is a snapshot (the current amount), Page outs is cumulative (page the same page out five times and it gets counted five times) <comment105568> [How can virtual memory be greater than the total available space?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/16415/8546) (2011-06-24)
