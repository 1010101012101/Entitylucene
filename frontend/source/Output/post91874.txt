Connecting two DVI monitors to a MBA 2012 <body> Can anyone tell me whether it's possible to connect two external DVI monitors to a 2012 macbook Air?  Ideally I'd like to do this through the thunderbolt connector with an adapter to drive both displays, but otherwise can anyone recommend a decent USB3 - DVI adapter is acceptable if it's equal to or better than what I would get via thunderbolt.  I'm not watching movies or gaming on the displays, as this is just for work which consists primarily of programming so maybe a USB - DVI adapter would be acceptable as well.  <answer91997> It is not officially possible to connect two external DVI monitors to a MacBook Air. Apple's support article states that you can only connect one non-Thunderbolt monitor per Thunderbolt port.  Additionally, you can look at hooking a second screen up via USB, using a product like those made by DisplayLink.  <answer99689> There recently was a similar discussion here at Ask Different: Two Monitors Setup On a MacBook Pro  The MacBook Pro described in that post has similar options/limitations as your MacBook Air when it comes to multi-monitor setups.  <comment107910> Connecting through Thunderbolt is possible, I remembered reading somewhere about a adapter that does that. It's not a simple adapter, it's active, and it's quite expensive. You can however go with a MiniDP - DVI adapter for one monitor, and let USB 3 handle the other one. TUAW featured one from Kensington recently, I believe you can still find that article. <comment107911> Here it is, http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/press/releases/2011/dualhead2go_dp/triplehead2go_dp/macbook_pro_thunderbolt/ I'm deeply sorry about the long link, I believe this **should** work. Please check with Matrox before purchasing, things like these might not work.
