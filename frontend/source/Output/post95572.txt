iMessage via WiFi only <body> Is there a way to rig iMessage so it receives (and, I guess,sends) messages only when connected via WiFi and not when connected via the carrier's data plan?  <answer95573> strongNo/strong, there's no such option / preference. You could, though, turn off your carrier's data plan altogether by turning off the strongCellular Data/strong option (under strongSettings / General/ Cellular/strong on iOS 6 and strongSettings / General / Network/strong on iOS 5).  <comment112116> Re your second sentence: Do you mean, under "Settings" / "Messages", to select "Send as SMS": "OFF"? <comment112118> @msh210 No. What I suggest will turn off your carrier's data plan. Despite the title, as in your questions you specify the *carrier's data plan* I just stuck to the Wifi - 3G (or whatever) restriction. If, indeed, you want to use it **only** via WiFi, then, yes, the *Send as SMS* should be disabled too. <comment112153> +1 on the answer ("No"), but I don't see any "Settings" / "Cellular". <comment112156> @msh210 My bad. I'll edit my answer with the correct path.
