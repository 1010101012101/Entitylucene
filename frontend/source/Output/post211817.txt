Mid-2015 - Borderlands weird screen texture when playing with the integrated Iris Pro <body> I'm playing Borderlands 1 GOTY (Game of the year edition) from the App Store. Tried playing it only with the Iris Pro, instead of the Radeon R9 370X, and the performance is stunning.  However I get this weird pixel like texture on the screen.  emIt doesn't move or blink, and it doesn't seem to effect the HUD or menus./em  It seems to be "exactly" the same texture no matter what and it gets more detailed when I up the resolution.  I've tested Deus Ex and Bastion with the same setup and they have absolutely no problem. It seems like a OS X driver issue, I've seen graphics card's problems in the past and they aren't that stable or selective.  Can anyone confirm?  PS. Use gfxCardStatus to change to Integrated Only.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/55602.jpg" alt="In game" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vf4Nm.jpg" alt="Respawning" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oAINr.jpg" alt="In game 2" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4NVlI.jpg" alt="Scope"  <comment259454> did you fix it eventually? I had it running perfectly fine, then deinstalled it, upgraded t El Capitan later, and installed it again. Now it looks like yours. <comment259455> This does not really answer the question.

It doesn't happen in Borderlands 2 or any other game I tried so it might still be a Borderlands 1 problem. Their advice was to wait it out and see if newer OS X updates fix it and just play using the 370X. A bummer too, the Intel GPU on these machines seems to perform very well even on max settings.
