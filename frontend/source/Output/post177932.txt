How do I change the action for Force Click on a Force Touch trackpad? <body> I have a new MacBook Pro Retina 13 Early 2015 with the Force Touch trackpad.  It's described to have the following feature:     Click and continue to press on the trackpad to enable new capabilities, like looking up a word's definition, previewing a file in the Finder, or creating a new Calendar event when you Force click a date in the text of an email.   Generally: strongHow can I change, tweak, tune, enhance the 'capability' of this force click?/strong  Particularly: I'd love to have it do translation in Safari and Terminal much more frequently than I want it to do dictionary lookup.  <answer177952> Apples has not released an option to change parameters of the Force Click feature quite yet. It's Apple after all, when they feel it's ready they will add the granularity you are seeking.  These are the options currently available to according to Apple's published documentation:  These are the Force Click options available at this time.  ol liRename any label /li liPreview any file/li liPreview Calendar dates/li liClick on any date to create an event/li liDrop a pin in Maps/li liPressure sensitive zoom in Maps/li liLookup the definition of any word/li liPressure sensitive fast forward/li liShow all windows from an open app/li liRight click on certain dock icons/li liEdit contact details/li liAdd a contact with number or email address/li liPreview any link (Safari only)/li liShow Do Not Disturb options in Messages/li liPressure sensitive drawing/li /ol  <answer219158> I found this tool called BetterTouchTool http://www.boastr.net/     BetterTouchTool is a great, feature packed app that allows you to   configure many gestures for your Magic Mouse, Macbook Trackpad and   Magic Trackpad and also Mouse Gestures for normal mice. It also allows   you to configure actions for keyboard shortcuts, normal mice buttons   and the Apple Remote. In addition to this it has an iOS companion App   (BTT Remote) which can also be configured to control your Mac the way   you want.   It allows me to set a HUGE variety of actions for TONS of mouse gestures.  I am able to create actions for FORCE click on specific areas of the trackpad, and even multifinger force click.  It is exactly what I've been looking for.  It is extremely useful.  <answer232035> If you want translations instead of dictionary lookups, you can change the preferences in the dictionary application. In the preferences you can decide what the dictionary checks when you force click a word. For example, you can uncheck the dictionary lookups and check the french to english dictionary.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTDoP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment210706> This only allows me to "adjust the pressure you need to Force click your trackpad", it doesn't indicate in any way how to "change, tweak, tune, enhance the 'capability' of Force Click". <comment210778> You appear to be fairly competent, given your askdiff score, you must be aware that they may not have released an option to change parameters of the Force Click feature quite yet.

Only 2 or more. <comment361934> Thanks for the info. Such a fail for what could be a feature rich action trigger.
