Pages "Send via email" doesn't work after upgrade <body> I just upgraded to Mountain Lion. So far, so good. Great upgrade. I also upgraded to Pages '09 latest version: 4.2.  "Send via email" option works on Pages strongif and only if Mail.app is not running/strong. If strongMail.app/strong is already running, when I choose emPDF/em, emWord/em or emPages/em option to send the document to someone, it does nothing.  It's pretty annoying since it's a feature I used to use regularly.  Anyone else with the same issue? Any suggestions?  <answer65034> I've got the same problem. Postbox seems to be the answer. Removed it and now Send via Mail works again.  <comment68333> All of the actions in the Share  Send via Mail menu work for me even if Mail was open. <comment76393> Can you please explain in more details why you think Postbox is the problem? <comment76485> There was a problem. I've removed Postbox. Problem disappeared.
