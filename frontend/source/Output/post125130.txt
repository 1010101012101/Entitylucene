Adding a photo directly to iPhone disk <body> I tried to add a picture in the folder code/User/Media/DCIM/100APPLE//code (the same as code/private/var/mobile/DCIM/100APPLE//code), but it doesn't show up in the Camera Roll.  How can we make it appear?br It's an iPhone 3G running iOS 4.3.1.  <answer125131> Following the advice in this forum thread, I've deleted the files (after backing up to the computer):  ul licode/User/Media/PhotoData/com.apple.photos.caches_metadata.plist/code /li licode/User/Media/PhotoData/Photos.sqlite/code  /li licode/User/Media/PhotoData/PhotosAux.sqlite/code/li /ul  After opening the Photos app again, it rebuilds the Library:     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0y5tL.png" alt="updating library" title="Please wait. Updating library..."   It's important to use the pattern codeIMG_0000.ext/code for the pictures file names:  ul licode0000/code being numeric ID of our choosing/li licode.ext/code is a JPG or PNG extension/li liwe can add letters after the numeric ID to prevent conflicts with the device ID counter, ie, codeIMG_0041b.png/code, codeIMG_0041c.png/code, codeIMG_0041d.png/code./li /ul
