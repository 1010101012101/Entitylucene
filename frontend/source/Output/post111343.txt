Mac software that automatically switches between applications every several seconds or so? <body> I need a Mac software that automatically switches between applications every 10 seconds or so. I need it for a trade show I am participating at.  In the past I've used AutoTab, but it is only for Windows.   Any idea if a similar software exists for Mac?  Regards,  <answer111354> You could create an AppleScript using the AppleScript Editor in code/Applications/Utilites/code. The syntax is quite easy to follow, and I'd base it on something like this:  precoderepeat   tell application "Safari" to activate   delay 10   tell application "Finder" to activate   delay 10 end repeat /code/pre  This will repeatedly have Safari and Finder get focus while waiting 10s in between. Having 10 seconds as an delay should give you enough time to re-open the editor and click on "stop". Another option would be to use coderepeat while/code instead and to create a stop criterium, like codeif exists "/path/to/makeitstop" as POSIX file/code which would make it stop after a file makeitstop is created.  <comment131027> Hello, thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, I am not a programmer and I can't do that. Doesn't such an application already exist? <comment131062> Well, it really is as easy as I described it: you open the Editor app, enter the text posted above and click run. Click stop to stop it. That's it. Try it. It's not complicated at all ;-)
