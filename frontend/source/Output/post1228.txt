On an iPhone, how can I tell when an accurate GPS position has been acquired? <body> When taking photos I like having my pictures geo-tagged.  How can I tell when an accurate GPS location is available?  <answer1229> Launch the Maps app and wait for the blue orb to pulse which indicates a full GPS lock. No other way to do this from within the Camera app.  <comment1150> Yep. The Camera app needs a little lock icon.
