What is near the front camera on iPad Air? <body> I have a screen protector from Tech Armor designed specifically for the iPad Air but it covers a small, barely visible port or opening of some sort near the front camera.   I thought it was a microphone at first but upon further research, I don't think it is since the two mics are on top and back.   Is it just a light sensor perhaps and therefore doesn't matter that it's covered by a clear film?  <answer115455> It is the Ambient light sensor (ALS).     If Auto-Brightness is on, iPad adjusts the screen brightness for current light conditions using the built-in ambient light sensor.
