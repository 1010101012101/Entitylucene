Why did iMessage stop working after upgrading to iOS 8.2? <body> After updating to iOS 8.2 I got a message saying "Your SIM sent a text message." Then I tried to send someone an iMessage and it sent an SMS instead even though that person is able to send and receive iMessages.  <answer176173> I guess the message is for security purposes(citation?) and for some reason it turned my iMessage off. Turning it back on fixed all my issues.   <comment208684> Looks like I'm not the only one. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6866832
