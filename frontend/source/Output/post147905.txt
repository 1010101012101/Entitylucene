Using Command-backtick (⌘-`) to toggle between windows <body> As far as I can tell, Command-backtick (⌘-`) behaviour in OSX 10.9 works as follows:  Given a stack of windows for the current application 1 2 3 4 5 6 in order of most to least recently used:  ul liDo it once: switch to window 2 (for the current application)./li liDo it again: switch to window 3./li /ul  However, if you click on window 2 before doing Command-` for the second time, window 1 gets the focus instead of window 3.  This behaviour differs from that of Command-Tab, which seems to always work as though the new application's current window had been clicked on, unless you hold Command in between presses of Tab.  While you continue to hold Command, a little overlay window is displayed to give you a visual representation of which applications are available and are getting the focus.  Is there a way to make Command-` work in a manner similar to that of Command-Tab?  I.E. so that the window stack will be reordered when, and only when, Command is released?  I find it distracting to have to a) remember whether or not I've clicked on the window I'm looking at and b) scrunch a finger down to engage the Shift key.  <answer272725> Use Witch https://manytricks.com/witch/ as suggested by timothymh. Toggle between all application windows and forget about Command-backtick altogether.  <comment177865> I appreciate your detail of how command backtick works. it was very nice and soemthing i was looking for. im new to mac. <comment301519> I don't know a solution but I wish I did- it drives me nuts to not be able to toggle back and forth between two windows. <comment318381> [Witch](https://manytricks.com/witch/) might do the trick, have you tried that? <comment337532> @Galax Use shift-command-` [⇧⌘`] to reverse back through the selection. <comment342763> @chriszanf Yeah that works the same as Windows of course if going up and down a stack without releasing Command (Alt on Windows) The problem is that when command is released, and I read a page for a bit, I need to remember if I clicked on that window at all, as if I did the stack will be re-ordered ant Command-Tab will take me back to the last window, and if I didn't click Command-Tab will keep moving down the stack! <comment342768> @timothymh Thanks, great suggestion- Witch does exactly what I (and I think the original poster) wanted!
