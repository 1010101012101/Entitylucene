If I use a prepaid SIM card from AT&T retail store in iPhone, do I get 3G or GSM service? <body> I have an officially unlocked iPhone 4 from a non-US carrier. Now that I'm in US, if buy a prepaid SIM card from AT&amp;T and use it in iPhone, do I get strong3G(WCDMA)/strong or strongGSM/strong network? To put it in the context, do I see "3G" or "E" in the iPhone status bar?  Could anyone clarify if this chart is correct?  precodeEnable 3G, Enable Cellular Data, Result Yes      , No                  , Make 3G call;  use no data Yes      , Yes                 , Make 3G call;  use 3G data No       , Yes                 , Make GSM call; use EDGE/GPRS data;  No       , No                  , Make GSM call; use no data;  /code/pre  <answer30806> Presuming that it's not a CMDA iPhone (i.e. not from Verizon/Sprint), you will see '3G' if you're in a 3G coverage area. The Enable 3G and Cellular Data options must be turned on in the Settings.  Sidenote: AT&amp;T requires purchasing a data package for their smartphones; no Pay per use.  As AT&amp;T also had a GSM network, you could also access that (and GPRS/EDGE as well).  Usual Terms and Conditions will probably apply.  <comment35367> I don't know the answer but wanted to point out that E is EDGE service and O is "GSM" service. <comment35422> Hi, I updated the question, could you take a look? Thanks! <comment35479> Yes. That chart is correct. Assuming you are in a coverage area with both 2G and 3G. If you were using Bell or Telus' network in Canada, they don't have GMS or GPRS/EDGE so you would lose all service if you disabled 3G.
