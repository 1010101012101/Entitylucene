Why do some explicit songs in iTunes not use the explicit tag? <body> I have run into a few songs that are explicit (for example Pegboard Nerds - BAMF) but do not use for explicit ID3 tag.  I understand that there are Explicit and Clean tags that can be added with an ID3 editor, and that this is not iTunes' fault for not applying those tags, but I thought iTunes had a general rule that explicit songs have to be marked as such.  Especially since Apple has the restrictions you can enable to disable downloading of explicit songs.  Is there a rule where iTunes requires that explicit tag? If so, could this just be a glitch that is causing the explicit tag to not show?
