Configure Airport to routers DMZ IP <body> I have a router connected to the Internet. I have connected my Airport Extreme to this router. I know this is receiving the message (Double NAT).  Since I want to receive all traffic on my Airport, I want to connect to the router's DMZ.  In which field do I enter the routers DMZ on my Airport Utility?  <answer121300> Apple uses the wording "Default Host" for a DMZ.   ol liOpen AirPort Utility/li liSelect the AirPort /li liClick Edit /li liClick the Network tab /li liNetwork Options/li liClick "Enable default host at"/li lienter the local IP you wish to use and done./li /ol  I hope you have the same version and same options visible as I do...  <answer189975> As Rob says, "Default Host" is what you are looking for.  The current version (as of June 2015) of the Airport Utilty App (iOS) uses the following path:  ol liOpen Airport Utility/li liSelect the Airport/li liClick 'Edit'/li liClick 'Advanced'/li liClick 'DHCP and NAT'/li liClick 'Default Host', and enter the IP address you want./li /ol  And the Airport Utility App (Mac) uses this path:  ol liOpen Airport Utility/li liSelect the Airport/li liClick 'Edit'/li liClick 'Network'/li liClick 'Network Options'/li liClick 'Default Host', and enter the IP address you want./li /ol  Separately, you would probably also go into 'Reservations' on the DHCP and NAT page so that you can map one certain device's MAC address to the IP you just set.  For example, to get XBoxLive to play nice, find the MAC address for your XBox (from the XBox menus), then set a reservation from that MAC address to a specific IP address that you choose, then set the 'Default Host' to that same IP.  That will put your XBox on the DMZ.
