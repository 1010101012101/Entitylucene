Prevent users from deleting iBooks from iPad <body> I will be preparing some iBook files to use on an exhibit in a  museum, and I am afraid that visitors accidentally (or not) delete the book from the iBooks app.  I looked at the Restriction Settings, but I didn't find anything that could help me.  Is it possible to do that?   <answer155091> codeSettings/code → codeGeneral/code → scroll down → codeRestrictions/code → codeEnable Restrictions/code → create passcode and enter it again when prompted → emwrite it down somewhere/em → toggle codeDeleting Apps/code to codeOFF/code.  <answer246034> Try this, setup Guide Access on your iPad and you activate the feature to block certain parts of the App, called "blind spots." See instructions here: How to Use Guided Access to Disable Parts of an iPad Screen  I hope this helps.  <comment182515> Thanks, I will test it later. So by disabling *app* deletion I can also disable *content* deletion?
