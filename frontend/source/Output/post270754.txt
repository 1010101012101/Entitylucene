Multiple keychain-db files on Sierra <body> I tried resetting my login keychain on Sierra because I was seeing lots of duplicate codesigning identities when running codesecurity find-identity -v -p codesigning/code. It renamed my login keychain to login_renamed_1 and created a new login keychain for me.  But when I run codesecurity list-keychains/code there are 12 items called code/&lt;my_user&gt;/Library/Keychains/login_renamed_1.keychain-db/code shown. So I tried deleting the login_renamed_1 keychain using Keychain Access, but still these keychain-db files remain.  I also tried rebooting.  How do I get rid of them?  <answer273355> So I discovered that you can fix it by editing the associated plist and remove the offending duplicates.  i.e. codesudo vi ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.plist/code
