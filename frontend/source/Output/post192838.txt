Control - C on a password prompt on the terminal <body> Occasionally, I request something with codesudo/code, but change my mind after the password prompt has arisen. If the program was executing, I could press kbdControl/kbd+kbdC/kbd to exit, but this has no effect on the password prompt. If it was codegksudo/code, then I could likewise press kbdCancel/kbd.   So, is there anyway I could cancel emsudo/em's password prompt besides pressing kbdEnter/kbd multiple times, waiting for the emwrong password/em dialogue?  <answer196964> I was unable to find acceptable explanation for that. It does not occur with every command. For instance, if you try codesudo ls/code you can usually terminate it using kbdctrl/kbd+kbdc/kbd.  You can still press enter immediately followed by kbdctrl/kbd+kbdc/kbd, that usually works.  <comment229674> [This](http://askubuntu.com/questions/582201/bash-control-c-behavior-c-gksudo-vs-sudo) might shed some light. <comment235640> True. I can't find now what command was causing the issue with the password prompt. Did you happen to find one? <comment235655> No, I was unable to find any, but I know they exist, because I have encountered same problem sometimes.
