Function keys as media keys by default <body> I know it's default behaviour on Apple keyboards for F1-F12 to act like media keys, which can also be disabled in settings (this option isn't present for me though). Can I make the opposite for a non-apple keyboard?  <comment358205> Just to clarify, you want to make the function keys on a non-Apple keyboard work as normal function keys, right? <comment358298> As an example, I want F7 to act like Play/Pause button without having to press Fn+F7 every time.
