Directory contents into a spreadsheet entry <body> I would like to turn the contents of a folder into entries for Numbers (or Excel) - is there a way to automate doing this?  <answer126574> The easiest (but somehow manual) way is to select all the files in Finder, copy them to the clipboard with kbdCmd-C/kbd and then pasting the names into a Numbers sheet with kbdCmd-V/kbd.  If you want more control, you can revert to Terminal for the emcopy/em step and run  precodecd /some/folder ls *.jpeg | pbcopy /code/pre  to get the name all jpeg files in this folder into the clipboard.    <answer126577> You can use Automator.app to create a service in finder.  Open Automator.  ul liCreate a new service documents/li liset the the service receives selected strongFolders/strong in strongFinder/strong/li liAdd a strongGet folder contents/strong Action./li liAdd a Get strongRun Applescript/strong Action./li lireplace the applescript content with the applescript below./li /ul  .  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theCsv to ""     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input         tell application "Finder" to set this_item to displayed name of item i of input         set this_item to this_item &amp; ",\\n"         set theCsv to theCsv &amp; this_item     end repeat     do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of theCsv &amp; " &gt; ~/Desktop/names.csv" end run /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVPCr.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul lisave the document/li /ul  Now when you select a folder in finder you can use the contextual menu to run the service on the folder.  It will create a .csv file on your desktop of the list. Which will open in Numbers.  Note: if you have more than one folder it will create a single list for both. It is possible to have it only work on the first folder or both individually  hr  UPDATE:  A quick applescript example to work on multiple folders in selection. This will create a individual file for each directory in the finder selection  precode    on run {input, parameters}         set theCsv to ""          set pathList to {}         repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input             tell application "Finder" to set the Cpath to container of item i of input as alias             if (Cpath as alias) is not in pathList then                 copy Cpath to end of pathList             end if         end repeat           repeat with a from 1 to number of items in pathList set this_item to item a of pathList     set thisFileName to ""         tell application "Finder" to set thisFileName to displayed name of (this_item as alias)              set the CSVpath to ""             repeat with i from 1 to number of items in input                  tell application "Finder"                     set the Cpath to container of item i of input as alias                      if container of item i of input as alias is this_item then                         set theName to displayed name of item i of input &amp; ",\\n"                         set CSVpath to CSVpath &amp; theName                      end if                 end tell             end repeat       do shell script "echo " &amp; quoted form of CSVpath &amp; " &gt; ~/Desktop/" &amp; quoted form of thisFileName &amp;  ".csv"         end repeat       end run /code/pre  UPDATE 2. This second example now uses the folder name as the name for the file  <comment148276> Just the filenames or addititional information (size, creation date etc) as well? <comment148277> Just the filename is my immediate need - thank you! <comment148327> That is great and functional, is it possible to tweak the code so that the name of the output .csv is the same as the input folder name? <comment148335> yes. give me a min <comment148337> @EyeOjO , done (second example only)
