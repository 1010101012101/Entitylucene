Is my refurbished iPad 2 a Model A? <body> I recently acquired a refurbished iPad 2 WiFi and, being an iOS developer, I would like to use it as a test device and load beta iOS versions on it.  Apple offers two different downloads, one for an "iPad 2" and one for an "iPad 2 (Model A)."  I'm not sure which one I can safely use.  This Ask Different answer states that iPad 2's with model number MC979 are not Rev A, whereas A1395 MC954 (black) or MC989 (white) are Model A's.  My iPad 2 has "Model A1395" written on the back, however in Settings - General - About, it lists the Model as FC769LL/A.  Is mine a Model A or not?  <answer163763> Apparently, the emVersion A/em is the iPad 2 that came out in March 2012 and was only sold in a 16GB version. It has a revised A5 CPU and it's strongModel Identifier/strong is emiPad2,4/em.   The two numbers you're referring to, provide different information.  The one on the back cover is the actual strongModel Number/strong, which in this case is emA1395/em, whereas the one retrieved from emSettings / General / About/em is the strongOrder Number/strong, and holds information regarding strongwhen/strong and strongwhere/strong the device was made, its strongcolour/strong and strongstorage/strong.  <comment191754> What makes an iPad an version A or not?
