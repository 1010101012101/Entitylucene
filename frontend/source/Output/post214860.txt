How to get previous shutdown cause? <body> I try to get previous shutdown cause and when it happened but i don't know correct syntax.  precodesyslog -k Sender kernel ??? /code/pre  I need to get date and time in start of the row and shutdown cause number in end of the row which can be negative number too.  <answer214866> I usually just run  precodesudo grep "Previous shutdown cause" /var/log/system.log /code/pre  or (if the above returns empty)  precodesudo zgrep "Previous shutdown cause" /var/log/system.log.*.gz /code/pre  <answer255536> You can run emConsole.app/em (e.g. from emLaunchpad/em) and in emAll messages/em and type emshutdown cause/em in emSearch/em box, this will list all codes in a row.  After selecting multiple rows, they can be copied into the clipboard.  <answer277428> In Sierra, use log:  precodelog show --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "shutdown cause"' /code/pre  <comment259505> syslog should be system.log on my Mac. <comment259507> @Gilby On mine as well, thanks
