Why does my macbook pro displays random garbled blocks? <body> Occasionally my macbook pro (15-inch, Early 2011 with mountain lion 10.8.2) displays random garbled blocks. This happens on external Apple displays and the laptop display.

You should run the Apple Hardware Test / Apple Diagnostics and look at the results.  <comment77340> Are you using gfxCardStatus by Cody Krieger? (If yes, update to the latest version.) <comment137884> I've had the same thing on two machines. The graphics card was bad and Apple replaced it under warranty. In one case, twice in about 5 weeks. <comment138207> This problem continued to persist. I had to get the logic board replaced to fix this issue
