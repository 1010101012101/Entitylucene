Configuring a New Mail Account in Apple Mail <body> I am trying to add a new mail account to my Apple Mail (OS X El Capitan, 10.11.4) on a MBP.  I know the precise settings and ports I have to use.  However, the standard dialog does not let me enter these and instead tries to determine the settings by itself.  However, after a while it just fails and does not let me add the account so that I get access to the configuration, where I can set the details.  I am confident that would allow me resolve the issues.  Is there a way to manually set everything from the beginning?  I am sure that I did not mess up with the server name etc. as I managed to configure everything correctly in Thunderbird.  However, there were some messages popping up in Thunderbird about invalid certificates.  Could that be the source of the problems?  If so, how can I convince Apple Mail to make an exception for that specific server?  <comment285026> have a look at http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/230605/apple-mail-9-2-how-to-specify-port-and-ssl-options-for-incoming-and-outgoing-im/230607#230607 <comment285034> That did it, thanks for the link and +1. <comment285037> Cool, glad it helped - let me flag this as a dupe, just so twice as many people can find the right answer by hitting either question...
