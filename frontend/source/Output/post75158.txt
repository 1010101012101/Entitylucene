After installing Adobe Acrobat, can I revert to Preview for handling PDF from Firefox? <body> I was used to download PDF from Firefox and open them with Preview PDF.  Yesterday I installed Adobe Reader and now each time I click on a PDF link Firefox tries to open the PDF with Abode Reader. And it doesn't work even. See the picture below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTgCM.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I go back to the previous behavior?  <answer75159> h11st thing to try/h1  ol liOpen Firefox/li liOpen Preferences (Firefox  Preferences, or kbdCommand/kbd + kbd,/kbd)/li liSelect the Applications tab/li liSearch for "pdf"/li liChange action to something else, then change it back to "Always Ask" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOcRj.png" alt="visual help"/li /ol  h1Verify this is set correctly/h1  ol liOpen Finder/li liSearch for .pdf/li liRight (kbdOption/kbd) Click the first PDF that appears./li liClick strongGet Info/strong/li liExpand strongOpen With/strong (if it isn't already)/li liChange it to "Preview"/li liClick strongChange All/strong button below the drop down menu/li liAccept the prompt./li /ol  For a visual representation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lsZB4.png" alt="step 1" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pr2Ef.png" alt="step 2" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TbHn4.png" alt="step 3"  <comment87269> Does it add any add ons? If yes, delete them. By the way, why in the name of God did you install Adobe Reader?! <comment87300> @duci9y ahaha you are right! Did it because it was suggested by a website for reading one of their document that cannot be viewed correctly with preview... <comment87301> It is already set in this way. That doesn't fix the problem. It's firefox that tries to use Adobe Reader. <comment87302> @duci9y No plugins and neither add-ons. <comment87303> Check Firefox Settings  Applications then. See if PDF is in that list. <comment87310> That made the trick. I already checked it and it was already setted to "Always ask". Now I changed it and re-changed again and it fixed the problem. Can you update your answer please? <comment87381> There you go. Thanks for accepting it.
