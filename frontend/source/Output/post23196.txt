How can I fix my Mac-Router-Mac network? <body> My network is amazing slow, and my question is what can I do about it.  I have done the following analysis:  Transfer from MacBookPro - Router - Mac Mini Intel Core 1 264,3 MB = 2114, MBit in 432 seconds. == 4,89 MBPS  Transfer from MacBookPro  - Mac Mini Intel Core 1 (Direct network) 264,3 MB = 2114, MBit in 295 seconds. == 7,16 MBPS  Transfer from MacBookPro - Router - MacBook Air 90,2 MB = 721,6 MBit in 147 seconds. == 4,90 MBPS  All connections via WLAN: 54 MBit/s, WPA2, WMM, autochannel. Router is a FRITZ!Box WLAN 3170   So, the router sucks a bit performance, thats OK. Anyway as the router shows me that all clients are connected with 54 MBit/s, shouldn't the transfer time less? What can I do/check to increase my networks speed?

This guide will be informative for you:  http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-basics/31083-smallnetbuilders-wireless-faq-the-essentials  Basically buy an Apple Airport Extreme to replace your current system, and try to use the 5Ghz frequencies instead of 2.4Ghz as you are probably suffering from a lot of interference.  Example setting up with existing router:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kVnJq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer23209> One thing you can do is to make sure that your wireless router is using a channel that doesn't overlap with the channels of the other wireless networks around you. The frequencies of adjacent channels (e.g., 2 and 3) overlap, which can result in interference. Lifehacker has some good tips for picking a channel here.  <comment25885> Do you know if Apple Airport Extreme can operate with an existing router (which includes the dsl modem)? I would like to avoid to buy another hardware component (the dsl modem) <comment25892> Yes, [details here](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305293). <comment25896> Good tipp thanks!! Will try that now <comment25933> I could double my speed with another channel. No it is 9 MBPS - not perfect, but better. Thanks! <comment71564> The single most effective speed boost you can get is to buy a modern router.  I get 11 megabytes/second from my MacBook Pro to my Time Capsule disk. <comment71565> Set the Airport to bridge your current router.   This mean you only have one network and one dhcp-server
