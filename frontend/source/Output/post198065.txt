AirPort Express Base Station "Guest" network does not allow logons. (spinning wheel) <body> I have set up an AirPort Express Base Station (June 2012 model, the current one). For setup, I used a Yosemite MacBook Pro over Ethernet. The AirPort Express has an Ethernet running from the WAN port to a CLEAR modem (a WiMAX service) in "Bridged" mode.  Both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks work well, devices connect with password and surf the web.   The third network, the emGuest/em network, does not let any client connect. I've tried both the MacBook Pro, an iPhone 5, and a MacBook Air repeatedly, power cycled, and so forth. When they attempt to join the strongpassword is accepted but the spinning wheel never stops/strong and the computer/device never finishes joining the network. We can switch back to either the 2.4 or 5 network instantly with no problems.  Any suggestions? Might Bridged mode be a problem with a Guest account?  <answer198081> The problem is the bridge mode:  From Apple Support:     The DHCP and NAT option in AirPort Utility application  Network tab  Router Mode (default mode) must be selected on your primary base station (â€¦)   If you had more than one Airport, all secondary stations must have Bridge mode on, given there is one Airport or Time Capsule working as the primary station.  <comment280050> It seems to be a real problem with DHCP on guest wifi network. I'm using a DHCP server from outside (not Airport DHCP) DHCP works fine on primary Wifi Network. Buty DHCP does not work fine on Guest Wifi Network.
