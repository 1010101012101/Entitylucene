Video player on iPad that doesn't stretch to full screen <body> I'm looking for a video player that doesn't stretch my 640x480 video files to full screen (1024x768), which degrades the quality IMHO.  Is such an app available?  <answer69868> OPLayerHD allows you to select the stretching mode, so you can select between full screen and actual ration of the video.  There is also a lite version, maybe you can try that one before buying the complete OPlayerHD  Alternativelly there was AVPlayerHD, which seems to be not available now.  <answer156968> How about nPlayer? It allows you to adjust the size of the video you're watching.     nPlayer provides high quality video play performance and easy control-UI supporting almost all kinds of video formats and codecs without file converting efforts.   <comment81125> I just tried it, but this app also does stretch, although remains the right aspect ratio. <comment81126> @MikeB Have you tried to double-tap on the video? <comment81127> Yes, but that doesn't do anything. Tried also pinching without result. I did found the aspect ratio option, but that does only influence the ratio, not stretching. Btw: I did use the lite version. <comment81134> @MikeB I'm using the complete version, which changes the ration with double-tap. If you have a way to install AVPlayerHD that will work for sure.
