Can I get an Angular2/Typescript App to log its errors in Chrome like in Angular1? <body> I have a Mac and like to use Split View, where 50% of my screen is my text editor (Atom) and the other 50% is for a web browser (chrome).  But if I want to see any logs in a typescript app I can either keep cycling between two different Mission Control desktops to see my terminal logs or use a plugin to manage my terminal in Atom but that eats up too much of my dev environment.  Is their a way (or any plugins) to get my typescript errors to forward themselves to be managed in my Chrome logs?
