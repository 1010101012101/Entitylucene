My iPad has a popup that says my iPad has a virus <body> When I went to a website, then it popped out to another website, it keeps saying that my iPad 2 has a virus, I deleted some of my apps, can someone help me? I'm worried.  <answer211341> I would make sure your software is up-to-date to the latest version of iOS that the iPad 2 can run. Also, close your windows, and relaunch Safari. Hope this helps.  <answer211343> You likely do not have a virus. It's probably just a popup that gets launched every time you re-open Safari.  Go to:  Settings  Safari  "Clear History and Website Data."  You won't lose any bookmarks, it will just clear your browser history and open tabs.  Let us know if that works for you!   <answer211347> Like sleepdeficit said, it's probably just a popup that appears every time you launch a page, but there's a way to get rid of it without losing your history and open tabs.  ol liForce close Safari./li liTurn off Wi-Fi (and cell service, if you have it)./li liReopen Safari and, since the page can't load, you won't get the popup./li liClose the tab that gave you the popup./li liTurn Wi-Fi (and cell service) back on./li /ol  Good luck!  <answer211382> It's almost certainly a javascript popup, not a virus. You can get rid of it by temporarily disabling Javascript.   Go to Settings - Safari - Advanced, and turn off Javascript. Now, go back to Safari and close that page so that it won't keep automatically opening. Finally, go back to the Settings and turn Javascript back on.  <answer286655> Since iOS 9.3, JavaScript popups are no longer completely modal — you can still interact with the browser UI. Tap the tab button to open the list of tabs and tap the × to close the tab.  <comment255130> Can you add a screenshot of the site including the pop-up? Also, why do you think you needed to delete some apps after seeing the pop-up? <comment255167> Apple should block popups containing "award", "reward" and "virus". Probably some more too. <comment255202> *The "Clear" method also will remove any tracking cookies or temp-files left by the ad. <comment281162> @ardaozkal even better don't allow popups to act modally always allow the user to be able to close a page <comment347695> @Mark Yup, this is [the solution they went for in iOS 9.3](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/40i3wq/ios_93_preview_including_night_mode/cyud17d/).
