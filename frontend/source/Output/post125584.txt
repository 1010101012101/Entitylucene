Broken Safari: Dom Exception 18 <body> I've just tried everything and I cannot seem to fix this for the life of me.  Basically, Safari has started reporting the following error in the JS console: "SecurityError: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent."  Most of Ajax interactions via https are not working, so I cannot log into Twitter, Facebook or even Apple's own Developer Center.  I've tried installing Webkit, and even removing all preferences files that I'm aware of.  Other local browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Opera...) work just fine.  I'm using Safari 7.0.2 in Mavericks.  <answer125588> Fixed.  After inspecting the exact JS error when accessing the twitter login page, the offending line was trying to access the browser local storage.    The "Privacy" settings in Safari had the "Block cookies and other website data" set to "Always".  I've set this to "From third parties and avertisers" and now it's working again.    <answer234028> emMore Specific Instructions (same solution)/em  strongTo enable third-party cookies:/strong  ol liOn your iPhone or iPad, go to strongSettings/strong./li liSelect strongSafari/strong./li liUnder strongPrivacy &amp; Security/strong, select strongBlock Cookies/strong./li liYou will be redirected to a list of options.
