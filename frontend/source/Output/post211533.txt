Is there an easy way to install Linux similar to Boot Camp? <body> I've so far been using Disk Utility to partition my Mac's drive and install Linux, but is there an easier way to do it, using something similar to Boot Camp, or a third-party software application that will split your drives easily (and is not malware)?  <answer211534> Apple's disk utility is all you need to partition your disk.    It's what Boot Camp calls underneath the hood.  Most Linux distributions have adequate information to make a DIY installer, but if you want something as polished as Boot Camp I would recommend Boot Runner by Two Canoes.  It comes with support so you don't really have to learn anything other than how to install Linux as it manages the dual-boot environment very well.   ul lihttp://twocanoes.com/products/mac/boot-runner/li /ul
