Can I use a different email/calendar/address book provider for Mac OS X and iOS? <body> I am afraid that the switch to iCloud will make life very complicated, particularly for Snow Leopard users like myself. I am also afraid that Apple will make life generally more complicated.  So I am wondering if I can theoretically switch to another provide for synced email configurations, address book data and calendars.  I don't mind paying for those services, I just need my address book, emails and calendars to be the same between my devices, ideally between Mac OS X and iOS and everything else (Linux, Windows, Solaris etc.).

But I've recently moved to Android. Some little setup details might have changed. <comment48376> Ta. I'll have a look at this. Is Apple's iOS calendar not configurable? How do I "sync contacts using the exchange protocol"? <comment48380> I've had plenty of troubles with getting created events on the iPhone to sync with the cloud. But more than that the iOS calendar was missing  *week view* and the ability to show *"connected events"* (events that last for several days). <comment48381> You set up contacts sync via exchange by choosing *Exchange instead of Gmail* for your accounts. Once you've setup your exchange account, you can choose to sync email and contacts. <comment48385> Sorry. I am confused. Choosing Exchange instead of Gmail where? <comment48386> @AndrewJ.Brehm See [this](https://www.google.com/help/hc/images/mobile_138740c_en.gif).
