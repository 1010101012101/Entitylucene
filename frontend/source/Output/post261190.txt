run applications from external hard drive <body> I have a hard drive taken from an old macbook. I am working on a university iMac, I want to run applications such as Android Studio from the External Hard drive however when I run the application from the external drive, the machine loads the Android studio application on the iMac not the External version. How can I get around this?  <answer261233> To open the app from an external disk, you have to refer to it explicitly using a Terminal command:  codeopen /Volumes/&lt;volume_name_of_external_disk&gt;/&lt;path_to_application&gt;/Android\ Studio.app/code  Having never used Android Studio, I don't know if there is a space between 'Android' and 'Studio' in the app name. If there is, the back-slash character in the codeopen/code command is required to delimit the space character.  Ex: codeopen /Volumes/ExternalDisk/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/code  <comment327135> ok thanks I will try this when I'm next in the lab
