What are page up/ page down keys on Macbook for TextMate? <body> In other apps I use Command-UpArrow / Command-DownArrow, but those go to beginning/end of file in TextMate.  <answer174731> kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#9650;/kbd and kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#9660;/kbd are Universal page up/down on OSX with abridged keyboards.  kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#9664;/kbd and kbdfn/kbd+kbd&#9654;/kbd are home and end respectively.
