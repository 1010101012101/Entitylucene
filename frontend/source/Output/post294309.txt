Problem with disk efi - Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error <body> I am dealing with some issues with a modified MacBook A1278 (RAM and SSD)  Yesterday night, I arrived home, plugged my mac into an ethernet cable, to check email account, Facebook, etc., and:   ul liI could not make http requests;/li liI could not access Network Preferences;/li /ul  I then rebooted my Mac and could access my boot system;  tried to:  ul liboot into an install partition;/li lisystem wouldn't install;/li liran into recovery mode;/li lirecovered partition using disk utility and first aid;/li lipartition got encrypted;/li /ul  Then booted into another system, made a couple of tests and realized:  ul lisomeone encrypted my hard drive remotely, or it simply got screwed up;/li /ul  please bear in mind that:  ul liI have backups of all the meaningful data;/li /ul  I erased partition after trying sudo dd if of to copy content of an alternative booting system i had to my main system, which runs, on my SSD.  I could not install macOS from scratch - encountered problems when installer would mount unmount and format system to start installing;  ran into troubleshooting mode:  ran the following commands:  precodeMBP-de-tmm:DATA - El capitan tmm$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE           IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *128.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Emptied                 127.7 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS DATA                    343.7 GB   disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3    4:                  Apple_HFS DATA - El capitan       126.4 GB   disk1s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s5    6:                  Apple_HFS Install OS X El Capitan 28.4 GB    disk1s6 MBP-de-tmm:DATA - El capitan tmm$ sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0        start       size  index  contents            0          1         PMBR            1          1         Pri GPT header            2         32         Pri GPT table           34          6                    40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640  249397856      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    249807496     262151             250069647         32         Sec GPT table    250069679          1         Sec GPT header BP-de-tmm:DATA - El capitan tmm$ diskutil mount disk0s2 &amp;&amp; diskutil mount readOnly disk0s2 Volume on disk0s2 failed to mount If the volume is damaged, try the "readOnly" option MBP-de-tmm:DATA - El capitan tmm$ diskutil repairDisk /dev/disk0 Repairing the partition map might erase disk0s1, proceed?

Doing some disk repair **after** doing some arbitrary `sudo dd if [...] of [...] ...` is often useless especially if you don't mention what you have dd'ed **exactly**. So better add the output of `diskutil list` and `sudo gpt -r show diskX`  with diskX the disk identifier of the SSD (probably disk0). <comment371513> can someone provide me some form of help on the given topic? still stuck in this <comment371521> Nothing is encrypted. What do you really want to do? Install macOS/OS X to disk0s2? Completely repartition disk0 (1 partition/GUID/HFS+ journaled) - if this fails for whatever reason your SATA cable is broken probably. <comment371525> it's not encrypted because i erased the hard drive before running these commands. i want to completely repartition disk0, to install el capitan in it. it works. but the EFI is damaged and as a matter of fact, i got this message containing Error: -69845: File system verify or repair failed Underlying error: 8: POSIX reports: Exec format error (look at the end of the gnu bash session i posted). this post explains how to fix this issue. https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/221115/efi-system-partition-repair the thing is that i already erased my drive, and don't want to recover data <comment371591> i just didn't realize what do i have to do in my particular case <comment371965> I already repaired EFI. but problem persists. most likely, media is managed or the data connector is damaged. but i would guess more easily that the problem lies in the hard drive itself
