fn + backspace (delete) works just at the second time as expected <body> I'm facing a weird misbehavior on my MacBook Pro (Retina). I switched the operating language from German to English several days ago. Since then, I can't use the "delete" button (codefn + backspace/code) anymore as before the language-change.  Whenever I press codedelete/code (codefn + backspace/code), the button behaves as I wouldn't press the codefn/code button (so just a regular codebackspace/code), but if I keep a finger on the codefn/code button, and press the codebackspace/code button again, then the next letter will be deleted (a regular deletion, which is my intention).  Is this a bug, or something I can change by settings?  My operating system is: macOS Sierra 10.12.3
