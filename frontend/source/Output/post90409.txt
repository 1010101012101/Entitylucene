Solarized theme for Terminal <body> I've installed the Solarized theme for Terminal.app and imported it. But my Terminal is strongall/strong gray, I don't get color highlighting on anything. Not even running Python terminal generates any color. How can I get the color highlighting working properly?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQp9W.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer90413> In the Solarized themes the bright green, yellow, blue, and cyan foreground colors seem to be almost the same as the default foreground color.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QsGha.png" alt=""  Or if you were expecting it to add color to new places, it doesn't. Terminal setting files only change the settings that can also be changed from Terminal's preferences, like the values of ANSI colors.  <answer100346> If you want coloured output from ls, look here https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized  <comment106174> Oh, OK, thanks. I guess I was expecting a more distinguished color output from my Terminal, i.e. like one can have with `ls -G` or any editor with colored syntax.
