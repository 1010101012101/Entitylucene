Hidden Documents folder after turning off iCloud Drive <body> I recently tried iCloud Drive for syncing my codeDesktop/code and codeDocuments/code folders. However, codeDocuments/code was already being synced via Dropbox and I noticed that iCloud Drive and Dropbox don't get along. Seemingly random files inside codeDocuments/code were copied over and over again for some reason.  So I decided to revert back to Dropbox and turn off iCloud sync. That worked fine on my iMac. However, doing the exact same thing on my MacBook Air made the Documents folder disappear. I quickly realized that it is only hidden (see screenshot), albeit without a preceding dot (code./code). I'm now struggling to unhide this folder. Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EB1bR.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer258258> Try run this in Terminal:  precodechflags nohidden ~/Documents /code/pre  <comment322822> Worked. Thanks!
