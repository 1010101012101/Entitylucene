App Store shows wrong app version for review comment <body> Behind each review there is a version like this (v1.5). I've encountered some comments which clearly use a newer version then it is shown. How is this possible ?  <comment147880> Could you add a screenshot or provide more information? <comment152273> In version 2.4.1 of my app I added a prompt to ask people to rate/review my app. 1600 people have done so, but all the reviews are in the App Store for version 2.3.1! The App Store must be marking the reviews incorrectly. <comment152378> @kukudas: In the cases you've found, were the apps upgraded to be universal binaries, and the reviews are for the pre-universal version? <comment152395> What do you mean by universal binary? <comment152421> @kukudas: A single app that works on both iPhone and iPad. <comment153401> No. Only for iPhone. But the binary was bigger due to 64 bit support.
