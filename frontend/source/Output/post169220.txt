Dock throwing NSInvalidArgumentException trying to start <body> Yesterday I noticed that I could no longer kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdTAB/kbd, minimize/maximize windows and that the Dock was missing. I've tried numerous things to resolve it:  ul lirebooting/li lireseting PRAM/li likilling Dock with codekillall -KILL Dock/code/li /ul  That last one should restart the process, but it didn't appear to initially:  precode$ killall -KILL Dock No matching processes belonging to you were found $ ps -ef|grep -i Dock   501  2145   826   0  7:50AM ttys000    0:00.00 grep -i Dock /code/pre  I opened up the Activity Monitor and noticed that it was repeatedly emtrying/em to restart the process:  img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/121322/5921970/c14db5d0-a5fc-11e4-8468-d8ef6ec47ce0.gif" alt=""  When I tried to restart it manually I noticed that a codeNSInvalidArgumentException/code was being thrown:  precode$ /System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/MacOS/Dock 2015-01-27 07:30:34.441 Dock[1126:38505] -[__NSCFNumber stringByExpandingTildeInPath]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x537 2015-01-27 07:30:34.442 Dock[1126:38505] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '-[__NSCFNumber stringByExpandingTildeInPath]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x537' *** First throw call stack: (   0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff8d6ec64c __exceptionPreprocess + 172   1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff819096de objc_exception_throw + 43   2   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff8d6ef6bd -[NSObject(NSObject) doesNotRecognizeSelector:] + 205   3   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff8d636a84 ___forwarding___ + 1028   4   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff8d6365f8 _CF_forwarding_prep_0 + 120   5   Dock                                0x000000010907feca Dock + 61130   6   Dock                                0x000000010907fd75 Dock + 60789   7   Dock                                0x000000010907f780 Dock + 59264   8   Dock                                0x000000010907cc70 Dock + 48240   9   Dock                                0x000000010907be54 Dock + 44628   10  Dock                                0x000000010907696c Dock + 22892   11  libdyld.dylib                       0x00007fff837e95c9 start + 1 ) libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException Abort trap: 6 /code/pre  Can anyone offer any suggestions? I miss my dock and my keyboard shortcuts...  <comment198711> I guess you could try `kill -9`? <comment198712> Safe mode? single user mode? Permissions repair? <comment198990> Thanks for the pointers. Still no dice with safe/single user/verbose mode or permissions repair. <comment201354> Remove preference files related to the Dock? <comment201450> Thanks, Ashley. I tried removing `com.apple.dock*` and restarting. Still have the same problem :( <comment201527> If you set up another user account (for testing), does the Dock function OK there?
