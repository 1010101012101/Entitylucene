How do I prevent my MacBook from sleeping when downloading apps from the App Store <body> When I try to download large apps from the App Store whether on battery or AC power the displays turns off after time set and downloading also stops.   The Energy Saver preferences are set to defaults.   What should I do to continue download even when display is off?   I am using OS X 10.9.4   <answer143593> In you Energy Saver options, just change "Computer sleep" option. For exemple you could put "Computer sleep" option to "Never" While on Power Adapter.  Default option put your Mac to sleep after 15 minutes while on Power Adapter.  <answer143594> You could set hot corners. Push the cursor to that corner &amp; it won't nod off.  That would save you having to change the regular policy, for the times you do want it to sleep after being idle.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YWMWP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer143597> You could try Caffeine from the Mac App Store:     Caffeine is a tiny program that puts an icon in the right side of your menu bar. Click it to prevent your Mac from automatically going to sleep, dimming the screen or starting screen savers. Click it again to go back. Right-click (or kbd⌘/kbd-click) the icon to show the menu.   <answer143599> ol liCheck strongPrevent computer from sleeping when the display is off/strong in the strongEnergy Saver/strong setting under strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liLeave it or press kbdshift/kbd+kbdcontrol/kbd+kbdPower/kbd to turn off the strongDisplay/strong./li /ol  <answer143652> If you don't want to install any software or change settings, you can use the Terminal utility codecaffeinate/code. Open Terminal (located in code/Applications/Utilities//code), type in codecaffeinate/code, and press kbdreturn ↩︎/kbd.  If you want to set a timeout so it will go to sleep after some amount of time, use this:  precodecaffeinate -t 3600 /code/pre  That will make it stay awake for an hour. (3600 is the number of seconds you want it to stay awake.)  To stop or cancel the codecaffeinate/code command, press kbd^ Control/kbdkbdC/kbd.  <answer222896> If you don't want it to sleep, just go to "System Preferences" then click "Energy Saver" then make your Mac's sleep auto to "Never". Then change it to "Normal" once download is done, Also one tip: attach the charger (or what ever you wanna call the charger I.E AC power etc.) while app/file/document/any other things are downloading.  If it's too complicated just go to "System Preferences" - "Energy Saver" then set it to "Never".  <answer222934> Try NoSleep Application.  It is simple and has easy to use User Interface You can even close your lid and listen to music after that. Your App Store will continue downloading even after closing the lid.  <answer238686> I suggest strongAmphetamine/strong, downloadable from the app store or here. Using the app, you can set up custom periods for your computer to sleep.   <answer296096> just leave a video running like a 8 hour sleep music video  <comment270194> I did this, it worked great. <comment291904> This would either disable the screensaver or put the display to sleep, it's not going to _prevent_ the laptop from going to sleep right? <comment292051> I haven't actually used it in years - my last 2 machines have never slept, in 8 years - but it used to be that if the screen didn't sleep, neither did the computer. Easy enough to test... <comment292774> Here is the Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12 <comment333442> Best answer so far, so handy for terminal lovers!
