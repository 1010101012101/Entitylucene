Force iCloud Drive to sync under Yosemite <body> There are many questions of forcing iCloud to sync, but they are generally  old and unclear as to the details.  I changed the file structure at my Mac, but the iOS App (Pages) doesn't seem to take the new update.   When I look through the folder structure via another iOS App, there is still the old structure. So it seems that my changes on the Mac didn't update yet.  Is there a way in Yosemite to force the iCloud sync?     There has to be a service which is triggered and runs in the background. Which service is it?   <answer207979> Yes. The sync process is kicked off when you disconnect from all networks and then reconnect. You can debug things using codebrctl log -w/code on the Mac and AppleCare can also help you with iOS cloud sync diag logs if you have an issue that needs that level of debugging.   The codebrctl/code man page has information on diagnostic files and you can also use codesysdiagnose/code to assist with cloud sync diagnosis.  The actual sync daemon is codebird/code but you don't run it directly.   Lastly, before digging into the logs, I often use https://iCloud.com to verify that the Mac and iOS devices are either in sync with the cloud version so I know which of the three is lagging.
