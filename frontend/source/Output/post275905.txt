Can I use Shift, Alt and Control Modifier Keys Together With the Function Keys on the Touch Bar? <body> I've configured my touch bar to always show function keys in one program where I use those frequently (IntelliJ IDEA, code editor). Many hotkeys in IDEA are triggered using a function key together with shift, alt or control, e.g. for renaming a variable, I use Shift+F6.  With the emulated function keys, this does not work, the program acts as if I had just hit F6 without holding down the alt key.  It was no problem with the hardware function keys on my old MacBook.  Is this a known bug, or a limitation one has to live with? Or is there some way to work around it? Perhaps I'm just to stupid and missing something obvious?  This is a major pain for me as a software developerâ€¦  <answer275908> Ah, after some digging, I found out it's the fault of Karabiner Elements, a utility program I'm using to reassign some keys.  https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/435
