NO LOGINS: System going down ... stuck and won't shutdown <body> I issued a remote SSH shutdown command to a headless Mac server. However, the server is not shutting down and I can no longer access the server with SSH, I get this message:     NO LOGINS: System going down at 08:16   This was nearly 20 minutes ago. What can I do now that the machine won't shut down and I cannot login?  I realize I can push the power button, but I have some Drobos attached that could loose data if don't gracefully shut down.  <answer233401> Strangely, the server did finally shutdown a few hours later. I verified the time zones are in-sync so not sure what the root cause was.  <answer262140> Go to Finder. In the menu bar click strongGo/strong, select strongGo to folder/strong, type code/etc//code and press kbdEnter/kbd. In the opened window find the "nologin" file and delete it. It's fixed.  <comment348207> This worked for me.  No idea how or why that `nologin` file appeared.
