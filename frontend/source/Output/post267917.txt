Freeing up iPhone storage <body> I'm trying to figure out how to free up phone storage space without losing all my pics. I have some loaded onto my laptop (Windows); don't know why they aren't all loading. I want to free up phone pic space but not lose all the pics.  Some have suggested turning off "upload my photo stream"...  I have the iOS 10, there is no longer a "stream", it is now "All Photos". But when I turn it to off position I get the prompt "turning off photo stream will delete all photo stream photos from your iPhone".  Will they be saved to the cloud or not?  Pretty confusing.  <answer270208> In iOS, they recently introduced an option to have all your photos saved to the cloud, and have low-quality photos remaining on your phone. If you go into Settings  Photos and select Optimize iPhone Storage, this will happen and a considerable amount of space will be freed.  hr  Another alternative is by an app that you can download. Search for "battery doctor" on the app store. The icon is a green battery with a plug coming out with a silver border. brbr Here's where it gets weird:  ol liOpen the app/li liWait for the spinning wheel to go away (located in the top menu bar, next to the WiFi indicator)/li liDouble tap in the blank bottom area (above the bottom menu, but below the top header)/li liQuit the app via the app switcher/li liOpen the app again, if it looks different, you're good. If not, go back to step 2./li liGo to the bottom menu item labeled "Junk"/li liClear your cached files./li /ol  As always, I recommend backing up before you do this. I was able to clean 1 GB this way, results may vary.
