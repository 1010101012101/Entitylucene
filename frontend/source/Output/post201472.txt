Smart Playlist in Itunes based on file location <body> I'd like to create a smart playlist in iTunes based on a specific folder (I manage my media library manually).  Is that somehow still possible in ITunes 12 (even if it involves scripting)?  <answer203249> I don't think so. They appear to use information from the iTunes database/Library so how could they know anything about some random folder in your computer?  You could though simulate it using either Folder Actions or launchd but neither is perfect.  Folder Actions only works for new files in a directory and it provides the list of files added to the program/script you will run so you know what's changed.   launchd on the other hand will run your script/app whenever anything changes in the folder(s), you can monitor mupltiple, but it will not tell you which path changed or how - added or removed etc.  I would go with launchd personally. If it is just a single folder you could hardcode it into your script.  As for the script, try this...  precodeset dpath to "/some/path/test/" set qdpath to quoted form of dpath set listname to "MyList" set adpath to (POSIX file dpath as alias)   # Get audio files in selected folder  #   -- alas no recursive search results without a lot more code... :( #   -- or use mdfind or other command line tool using `do shell script...` set afiles to {} tell application "Finder"     repeat with ext in {".mp3", ".m4a"}         set l to (every file in adpath whose name contains ext)         repeat with f in l             set end of afiles to (f as alias)         end repeat     end repeat end tell  tell application "iTunes"     if not (user playlist listname exists) then         make new user playlist with properties {name:listname}     end if      # Built a list of existing list tracks so we don't have duplicates...     set itracks to {}     try         set itracks to (get location of every track in playlist listname)     end try      set view of window 1 to playlist listname      # Add not already in playlist     repeat with afile in afiles         if afile is not in itracks then             try                 set tid to (add afile to playlist listname)             end try         end if     end repeat      # Remove any tracks from the itunes playlist not in the folder     # and from the iTunes database else they still show up as invalid tracks...     set iItems to (every track in playlist listname)     set iLib to library playlist named "Library"     repeat with iItem in iItems         set loc to location of iItem         if loc is not in afiles then             set pid to persistent ID of iItem              log "Removing: " &amp; loc             try                 # Thanks Doug Adams, it was driving me nuts....                 delete (some file track of library playlist 1 whose persistent ID is pid)             end try             delay 1         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  It is actually fun to watch it react to adding and removing files from the folder.

I wrote an AppleScript which saves the location to the (useless) description tag. When I have more time I will dive into `launchd`. <comment245169> No problem. A similar solution to yours was suggested elsewhere, though I can't find it now. It's fine if you don't use the field and you remember to change them all. In any case, this was fun to do as I'd never played with launch agents before. The script was a modified version of what I wrote recently so it was no big deal.
