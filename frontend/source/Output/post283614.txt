How to detect what binded to some shortcut? <body> I am using editor for developers: Visual Studio Code. There is some keybinding: Shift + Options + F. It reformats code.  When I press it - no code is reformatted, but I get a code ̰/code symbol in the editor. What is it? How to debug what exactly catches this keybinding and do something?  It is not first problem. Yesterday I saw that shortcut for my action is F11. I press F11 and nothing happens. After that I accidently (when I was not on full-screen application) noticed that F11 shows the desktop. I realised, that I can unbind it in system prefs and that worked. But I didn't find Shift + Opts + F shortcut in system prefs.  <comment357601> What keyboard layout do you use? <comment357602> ̰  is the 'COMBINING TILDE BELOW' (U+0330) (0xCCB0) <comment357605> @MaxRied what do you mean when you say keyboard layout? Do you mean input source? I have ABC - Extended. <comment357606> US English? Russian? US International? <comment357607> @klanomath okay, thank you! but why it appears when I press Shift-Opts-F? How to disable this behaviour? <comment357608> @maxried I think I have `English, International (Z)` (from [this](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201794) source) <comment357609> Here is [the photo](http://i.imgur.com/YAIxCjy.jpg). <comment357610> Oh no! Wait =) I have russian layout =) of course. I just found some english that fits to my russian keys (~ key, ± key etc =) ) <comment357611> in macOS opt/alt-.../shift-opt/alt-... is not considered a (classical) short cut.... Here shift-alt-F is `Ï`
