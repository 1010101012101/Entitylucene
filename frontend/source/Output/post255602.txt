macOS Sierra downloaded, but then disappears <body> I tried downloading macOS Sierra in the App Store. The download seems to be successful, but then the installation never happens. One solution I saw is to look for "Install macOS Sierra" in Applications, but it is not there. It's in Applications while it's downloading, so it should be there when it's done. I tried searching with Spotlight just to be sure and got no hits. The macOS Sierra App Store page says "Download" instead of "Downloaded". It's like the download never happened. Restarting and repeating did not solve the issue. Any idea what might be wrong?  What's really strange is if I go to System Information  Software  Installations, it's there, so it really was downloaded:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tktz1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer256929> Start up with safe mode and then try to download and install. Here is how to enter into Safe Mode.  I have same problem and succeed to upgrade to Sierra in Safe Mode.  Good luck!  <answer275768> Very Simple Open "SpotLight Search" then type sierra.app or any other version you have downloaded then drag and drop the installer to desktop.....and then copy the installer where you want...  <comment318364> Please check if you have a "second" "Install macOS Sierra.app" somewhere (e.g. a Sierra beta installer moved to another folder than Applications). I have downloaded it once, moved it to a special installer folder but never installed it - it's listed in Software  Installations though. If I download a full updated installer version, it usually replaces the older OS X installer app and doesn't occur in the Applications folder. <comment318368> @klanomath I never downloaded Sierra before. I tried searching with Spotlight just to be sure and got no hits. Additionally, it's in Applications while it's downloading, so it should end up there I would think. <comment320365> I have same problem, and just fired a question on Apple discussions: https://discussions.apple.com/message/30786254, but nobody replied yet. <comment320641> Worked for me too. <comment346996> The OP mentions in the comments that "I tried searching with Spotlight just to be sure and got no hits."
