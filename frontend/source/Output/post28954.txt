TinyUmbrella can't find shsh for iOS5 <body> Before iOS5, we were recommended to save our iPhone's shsh so that when a jb came out, we could restore it back a jb-ed version.  For iOS5, Tiny Umbrella couldn't find any shsh.  So, is there anything we should do while waiting for iOS5's untethered jb?  <comment33280> Not really. Use your device? SHSH blobs have changed in iOS 5 and will most likely no longer be of use. <comment33281> Source? (8 more to go...) <comment33294> @VxJasonxV http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/6952986620/blob-monster <comment33426> @cksum should really have added this as an answer!
