Simple On-the-fly keystroke macro recorder? <body> What I really want is a simple tool which has two keyboard shortcuts: The first starts/stops a keystroke recorder.  The second then plays back that recording.   I don't need anything else and though I'm open to more useful features, I don't want it to conflict with Alfred's brilliant multi-clipboard or Dash's brilliant code snippet macros.  Any ideas? Many thanks...  <answer170647> It's an expensive option (36$), but Keyboard Maestro can do this.     Whether you are a power user or a grandparent (or both!), your time is   precious. So why waste it when Keyboard Maestro can help improve   almost every aspect of using your Mac. Even the simplest things, like   typing your email address, or going to Gmail or Facebook, launching   Pages, or duplicating a line, all take time and add frustration. Let   Keyboard Maestro help make your Mac life more pleasant and efficient.   <comment200805> Yeah I saw that but I wasn't clear on whether it would have the very simple hotkey based operation I was referring to.  I already have snippets with hotkeys. I just want one I can record and use on-the-fly for disposable bits of text I need to repeat in the short term.
