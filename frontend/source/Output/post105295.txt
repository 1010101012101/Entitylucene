An "Untitled" app icon is created on iPhone home screen after restart even after deletion <body> I have a white app icon titled "Untitled". When I click on it, it opens a Safari window with Untitled title window. After deleting it, if I restart the iPhone, it gets created again.  Is there a way to delete it permanently?  <answer153819> The procedure will require for you to SSH into your device.   Navigate to "private/var/mobile/library/webclips" and delete any clips (folders) entries.  By deleting these entries, it will eradicate the untitled icons appearing on your springboard.
