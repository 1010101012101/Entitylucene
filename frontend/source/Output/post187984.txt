Yosemite 10.10.3 crashing often <body> I've only been using my MBPr for a few weeks and it's been crashing often. It'll freeze and then either restart on its own, or what's often the case, need a hard reset. It started doing this on the second day. Currently, I've got Bootcamp going with Windows 8.1. I've noticed, though, that the crashing occurs way more while on OS X.  I've tried:  ul liresetting NVRAM and SMC/li lireinstalling Yosemite/li /ul  What I've done on my Mac as of recently re: Bootcamp are:  ul liInstall 8.1 through BCA/li liRemove Windows partition because I realized that I need a larger Windows partition/li liReinstalled 8.1. through BCA/li /ul  I've noticed that crashes are more frequent when viewing videos (on VLC) and/or when playing music (iTunes, Spotify) but there also very random instances while browsing (used both Safari and Chrome) and just earlier when I used a new printer.  This is the log from the most recent crash (around 5 minutes before and until the crash):  precode5/20/15 7:53:54.000 PM kernel[0]: process steam_osx[352] caught causing excessive wakeups.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  UPDATE: I tried to reinstall Yosemite but it crashed halfway through so I took it to a Service Centre. They tested the hardware and said it passed all of their tests. They reinstalled Yosemite and now that I've got it back, it still crashes. I've isolated some apps that were crashing, even weeded out the Spigot adware and all that but random crashes still happen. I keep checking the console logs just before I had to reset and the logs are different each time so I'm having a hard time isolating the problem. Is Yosemite really this unstable?  Update: I took the unit to an authorized service center. They cleared it of any hardware issues and reinstalled Yosemite. When I got it back, the crashing continued. I have now updated to 10.10.4.  I've noticed that crashes only occur when I'm connected to the internet. It's stable when I am offline. Everytime a crash happens, I check the console but the messages before the crash are different each time which has made it difficult to isolate the problem. I have noticed though that awdd crashes very often, I get the deny file-read-data /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security-common.plist often from WebKit.Content, cloud, and a lot of other core apps (i have tried to locate this plist but have been unable to find the exact file) and WARNING: The Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion is returning 10.9.4 instead of 10.10.4. Use NSProcessInfo's operatingSystemVersion property to get correct system version number. from a lot of apps (Firefox, MS Office, etc.).

When it happens, it's instant. The system is still running. I can move the pointer. But otherwise the entire screen freezes. If I'm lucky it unfreezes in a fraction of a minute. If I'm unlucky it doesn't do that and I have to force a reboot.  I've linked it to this message:  precode5/20/15 8:01:30.630 PM com.apple.WebKit.WebContent[397]: Ignoring controlTimebase set by client because AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer was added to a synchronizer /code/pre  The message itself doesn't look concerning. But it does tend to appear at the exact time of a freeze. There's probably something AV-related going on, that also generates that message. I actually found this thread and several others by searching for that message. They're all about the freeze.  Remember com.apple.WebKit.WebContent is the name of the entire process. Lots of libraries are loaded in that process, WebKit being only one of them. It also doesn't mean other processes (like VLC or iTunes, as mentioned in the original post) can't do the same thing. An AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is a part of AVFoundation that can be put somewhere in a window to display video, for one thing.  <comment226601> Have you tried logging in from a different User account to see if the same issues are present? <comment227416> @Ender Yes and it still happens.
