gifs in slideshow or screensaver <body> Is there any way to show gif (animated) images in a slideshow or a screensaver? The screensaver app does not animate the gifs and the only way to view gifs is through Quick Look.  <answer167933> Since a animated gif is just a collection of multiple slides (frames) I would take the animated gif file and export it as individual frames in to a folder.  Then in screen saver choose that folder.  Now you can adjust the slideshow (animation) to a time of your liking using following n your Terminal: triple click following and copy/paste  precodesudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "set ':JustASlide:mainDuration' 3" /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Slideshows.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Content/EffectDescriptions.plist /code/pre  --- see the number 3 in that long command!  that is in seconds, and you can use (change) to any number that suits you.  <answer215812> I made a tiny screensaver that can play GIF's and can run in background. It is free and I upload the source code to Github so that every one can look how it is done and participate in further development.   I only test the screensaver under 10.9.5 so I don't know if has issues on newer OSX releases(?).   Here is the Github link:  https://github.com/Stino/AnimatedGif   And here a ZIP of the compiled screensaver:  https://github.com/Stino/AnimatedGif/blob/master/Release/AnimatedGif.saver.zip
