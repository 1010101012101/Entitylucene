A specific problem with altering the Mac command-key layout to behave like Windows <body> I want to change kbdCommand/kbd+kbdSpace/kbd combination to change keyboard layout to a Windows like kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd but the Lion's keyboard settings does not react when I assign that particular combination. It allows me to change it to a other combinations, however. I assume this is because kbdAlt/kbd+kbdShift/kbd is already being used by some other program, but which one? How can I tell that and what can I do to override that setting?  <answer22693> I don't think you can use alt + shift for anything by itself.  It is used for all kinds of special characters in combination with a letter key.  strongHow Mac OS X lets you toggle between different international language keyboard layouts/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bw4Qc.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHow Mac OS X uses the "Option" key as a "dead key" to enable typing diacriticals for Western European languages in the US keyboard layout./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jeYar.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongHere is where a conflict may arise./strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/03zAu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment25296> The Alt-key, or Option key as we call it, on the Mac, is used in conjunction with letter keys to make letters with diacriticals, such as é, ü, ø, ñ and ç. Therefore I suspect it is not normally possible to remap this key. Sounds like a job for Ukelele, if it is possible at all. http://goo.gl/iFLae <comment25297> Thanks! So is it correct to assume that this Command + Space combination has been used for that purpose for a long time? <comment25298> The Option key has been used to type diacriticals since the first Mac in 1984. <comment25299> Command-Space and Option-Command-Space are the reserved key combinations to advance from one keyboard layout to the next. I'll add a screen shot or two above.
