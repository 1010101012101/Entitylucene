Quick Look a URL via a script (Applescript, Automator, Shellâ€¦)? <body> Lion added the ability to Quick Look a URL in an application (like codeMail.app/code). I would like to use that functionality from a script.  Is that possible?  <answer125401> Yes, it is possible, but not directly from the internet. The file needs to be downloaded first.  precodeqlmanage -p '/path/to/file' /code/pre  will show the quick look preview for that file. It will also write some debug information to stderr, so I usually append code&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1/code to the end of the command.  In your case, you will need to download the file first in order to get to the Quick Look preview. You also need the proper extension for qlmanage to recognize the file. codecd ~/tmp; curl "$url" --O "quicklook.$extension"/code will download it into ~/tmp (this directory needs to exist) and you will need to set the extension beforehand with codeextension=${url##*.}/code. hr The final shell script:   precodecd ~/tmp url='http://images.apple.com/mac/home/images/hero_30years_then.jpg' extension=${url##*.} curl "$url" --O "quicklook.$extension" qlmanage -p "quicklook.$extension" /code/pre  And in an applescript:  precodeset quicklookurl to "http://images.apple.com/mac/home/images/hero_30years_then.jpg" do shell script "cd ~/tmp; url=" &amp; quoted form of quicklookurl &amp; "; extension=${url##*.}; curl \"$url\" --O \"quicklook.$extension\"; qlmanage -p \"quicklook.$extension\"" /code/pre  <answer125416> There is also an Automator action for displaying a website in a Quick Look like window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGpTu.png" alt=""  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeautomator -i http://apple.com Desktop/Website\ Popup.workflow /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxniy.png" alt=""
