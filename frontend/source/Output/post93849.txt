Is there a tool to auto-restore network shares? <body> I log on to my work VPN very infrequently. Whenever I do that, I have to painfully re-connect manually to all the network shares I use there.  Is there a tool (preferably with a UI) that can help me with this small but persistent inconvenience?  (Alternatively, is there a way to keep network shares in finder and re-connect to them with one click?)  <answer102545> h1Sidekick by Oomph/h1  I use an app called Sidekick.  It mounts my drives, printers and other network devices automatically.  I have multiple configs for multiple networks and it automatically mounts what I need based on the network it senses.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2DZS.png" height="400"  <comment120707> Looks interesting. Is it easy to set up? Got a screenshot or short set of instructions, perhaps?  Does it re-connect the servers automatically if they get disconnected?
