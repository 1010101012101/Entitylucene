Enable screensharing via SSH and setting password <body> I am trying to enable VNC (Screen Sharing) on my Mac running OS X Yosemitebr I have been able to run this command codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist/code (source) to turn VNC on.  The only issue running this command is, it sets a password automatically, in which I do not know what it is, I have to fix it by logging in physically to the computer.  Is there a way how I can enable VNC via SSH and setting the password as the users password?  <answer200559> If you need to set a VNC password - you might need to also kickstart the ARDAgent, you can use this command instead of just loading the plist:  precodesudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw mypasswd -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  The analogous command for using user/password of existing users would be:  precodesudo  /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -configure -allowAccessFor -allUsers -configure -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  More detail and discussion at:  How to enable OS X screen sharing (VNC) through SSH?  <comment241648> Hmm - I never use the VNC password at all. What client are you using to connect to OS X? Perhaps changing that alone would suffice? <comment241660> That doesn't work for me. I am either such at connecting or authentication. The VNC client I am using is 'RealVNC' iOS app. That command enables Remote Management for all users. <comment241663> @iProgram Cool - If you want to try out Screens app - it works with the above. I'm hoping someone else has a different solution for you. <comment241666> Thanks for your suggestion of Screens app. Only think is it costs Â£10.99! Not paying that amount for an app! Just trying out stuff with OS X remote settings (VNC Remote Management, SSH etc) to turn them on and off via terminal. :) Not important if I can't do this. <comment241670> @iProgram I agree - knowing what a tool is worth is important. For me, using remote sessions across dozens of OS and a handful of devices - that app paid for itself in a week of work. As long as you can trade time for learning - DIY is always fun. <comment349895> I still get "TightVNC Viewer: Authentication reason: Authentication or authorization failure" even after running these commands. Is this supposed to be changing the VNC password to my login password? <comment349896> @Michael no the commands here simply enable ARD and kickstart the listener. If you need a VNC password different than a log in password, I only know to set that up in the system preference, not from command line. <comment349914> ok, i only ask because it wasn't accepting my login password
