CalendarAgent continuous error generation in MacOS 10.12.4 <body> After upgrading to MacOS 10.12.4 today, I started getting tons of Error/Fault log message in the Console generated by the codeCalendarAgent/code process.  Some of the errors are pasted below:   precodeerror: sql cached statement NSSQLiteStatement &lt;0x7fae52e27ad0&gt; on entity 'CalDAVError' with sql text 'SELECT t0.Z_ENT, t0.Z_PK, t0.Z_OPT, t0.ZCODE, t0.ZDOMAIN, t0.ZUSERINFO, t0.ZCHANGEREQUEST, t0.Z8_CHANGEREQUEST, t0.ZPRINCIPAL, t0.ZOPERATION, t0.ZPRINCIPAL1, t0.ZPUBLICATION, t0.ZSUBSCRIPTIONINFO FROM ZERROR t0 WHERE ( t0.ZPRINCIPAL IN (SELECT * FROM _Z_intarray0)  AND  t0.Z_ENT = ?) ' failed due to missing variable binding for (null) with expecting bindings (     "&lt;NSSQLBindVariable: 0x7fae52eed410&gt;" ) but actual substitution variables {     destinations = "{0x400072b &lt;x-coredata://F6135326-AEE3-4C69-AD55-060EF81D21A6/CalDAVPrincipal/p16&gt;}"; }  error: sql cached statement NSSQLiteStatement &lt;0x7fae551cadc0&gt; on entity 'Attachment' with sql text 'SELECT 0, t0.Z_PK, t0.Z_OPT, t0.ZATTACHMENTID, t0.ZCONTENTTYPE, t0.ZFILENAMEINCACHE, t0.ZFILENAMESUGGESTEDBYSERVER, t0.ZISAUTOARCHIVED, t0.ZISCACHED, t0.ZOMITSYNCRECORD, t0.ZPATHONDISKSTRING, t0.ZURLSTRING, t0.ZUUID, t0.ZITEM, t0.Z4_ITEM FROM ZATTACHMENT t0 WHERE  t0.ZITEM IN (SELECT * FROM _Z_intarray0)  ORDER BY t0.ZITEM' failed due to missing variable binding for (null) with expecting bindings ( ) but actual substitution variables {     destinations = "{0xd340030b &lt;x-coredata://F6135326-AEE3-4C69-AD55-060EF81D21A6/Event/p845&gt;, 0xf2c0030b &lt;x-coredata://F6135326-AEE3-4C69-AD55-060EF81D21A6/Event/p971&gt;}"; } /code/pre  The number of errors generated within a few minutes is more than 6000!. What do you think the reason could be?  If you think I need to add more details, please state in the comments.   <answer283511> Try removing the two calendar-cache files from code~/Library/Calendars/code and restarting the application.  <comment352601> Discovered same today.. researching it now. You found an answer? <comment352619> @J.C.Matos no, not yet. I have tried to remove some of the calendar-related files to no avail. There are quite many other I get sporadically. <comment357440> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.  Ideally, you want to explain why your answer is *right."  It also helps to provide links, citations, and/or screen shots.  Please review our help section [How to Answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-answer) on writing good answers to questions <comment357479> Did I just get down voted for a correct answer because I was too concise? This is not rocket science... <comment357482> I didn't downvote you (I only downvote when there's egregious errors) and I disagree (very emphatically) with the voter if that was the premise.  I will upvote to cancel it out; though you should consider rewriting/expanding to *explain* what you are doing and why. <comment357496> In 10.12 they completely revamped console and the logging subsystem. Unfort it is way too verbose now. If you're not actually experiencing a problem then it's probably safe to ignore. <comment357509> @Hefewe1zen Yes, that is what I also suspect due to the fact that, as you stated, the number of errors generated are staggering. Other processes as well produce tons of error messages. <comment357511> @xtfer I am guessing your concise and to-the-point answer actually solved my problem :) So, thanks for that and do not worry about the downvotes. No matter how you try to abide by the Stackoverflow regulations, there will always be someone to downvote:) <comment358832> Alas, makes no difference here, the problem recurs. <comment365057> Unfortunately, I have to remove the "accepted" tick from the answer because the problem has been recurring since.
