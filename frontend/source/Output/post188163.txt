How can I turn off responses to Calendar invites? <body> When I accept or decline a meeting invite, Calendar automatically sends an email to the person that invited me to the meeting.  OS X 10.10.2 calendar app  How can I turn this off so that no response is sent?  <comment264899> I have the same issue using Mail with an MS Exchange server. What server are you using? There is a "gesture" in Outlook for this (Accept = Do Not Send a Response) but not in Mail. I don't see any settings in Mail nor Calendar for this. Did you figure this out? <comment336064> This now has a partial answer at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/264615/85275 - but only for Spam invites
