cannot change icloud account email address <body> when I go to icloud on my iphone 4s is says verifying email address. It will not let me click on any of the settings to turn off my phone or will not let me change the email address because it is still verifying. I do not know the password for the email account  <comment198537> Start at http://iforgot.apple.com If the phone is locked, the only way to access it is to prove to Apple that it's yours. <comment198544> did you receive a verification email?
