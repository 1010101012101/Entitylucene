iOS 8 MAC address randomization <body> I was reading this news, and it got me thinking: will this be a hard setting or configurable?   How can I configure or understand how this works so I can work with services that recognize my MAC address for authentication.  <answer134547> I'm not up-to-date with how it works exactly. But I've heard that the MAC address is only randomized when it's looking for all available WiFi networks. When an user selects a network to connect with, your non-randomized standard MAC address is used. I think this wouldn't be any problem.  <answer134549> This is easy to answer as it will only display as random when you're not connected. If you get connected (using a password for example) the strongreal mac-address/strong will be shown to the router.  It's just a randomize function for strongunknown networks/strong.
