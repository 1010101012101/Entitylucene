Press enter button using Dictation on Mac <body> Is it possible to use macOS dictation to press the enter button (I want to select an item not start a new line)? Is it possible to press the command or function buttons using dictation?  <answer287646> You can use ‘press return key’ or ‘enter that’.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ra38Q.png" alt=""  <comment363218> Does this work for any key such as the command or function keys? <comment363220> @Chem No, see the list of commands available from the Accessibility preference pane, under the Dictation section, shown in my screenshot. <comment363221> CN you add your own commands? <comment363222> @Chem Yes, but not for modifier keys only, so you can make a dictation command which presses ⇧⌘4 for example, but not one which presses ⇧⌘ only. Click the + button to add a command.
