"Pasting" text to Java applet through keyboard emulation <body> I have a Java applet that I need to paste lots of text into. However, the paste options doesn't work (neither keyboard shortcut, nor right-button menu).  strongI'm looking for a way to emulate a keyboard and write automatically all the text I'd like to paste into the textbox in the applet./strong  <answer69812> It's a bit hacky, but you can do this with an AppleScript. Open up AppleScript Editor (in emApplications/Utilities/em) and paste in the following script.  precodeset myString to the clipboard  -- Switch to last application tell application "System Events"     keystroke tab using (command down) end tell delay 0.5  -- Enter the clipboard text repeat with i from 1 to length of myString     set theKey to character i of myString      tell application "System Events"         keystroke theKey     end tell  end repeat /code/pre  Make sure your applet is the previously used application, and the text you want entered is copied to the clipboard, then hit Run.  The script switches to the last application by emulating kbdcommand/kbdkbdtab/kbd (so be sure your applet is the previous application), waits half a second (this avoids entering text before the app switches), then emulates a key press for all the text in the clipboard.  If you want to make it more reliable (if the app switcher doesn't fire properly), you can try replacing the lines from codetell application[…]/code to codedelay 0.5/code with codetell application "YourApp" to activate/code. Replace codeYourApp/code with the name of whatever runs your applet (it may be the applet name, or the runtime environment — whatever's in bold text next to the Apple menu).  Let me know if you have any questions or problems.  <comment81088> It worked great, thanks!
