iPod Touch home button having issues <body> My iPod Touch home button recently started being less responsive. Any way to fix this, preferably without hardware changes?  <answer46340> Have you tried this perhaps -- http://www.idownloadblog.com/2011/12/22/recalibrate-home-button-responsive/?  <comment52959> Will try that now <comment52960> Seemed to help. Placebo or not, i'm fine with it! <comment52962> :-) Placebo effect can be good at times.
