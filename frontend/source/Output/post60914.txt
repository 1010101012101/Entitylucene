Remap Home and End Keys to beginning and end of line in Mountain Lion <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Remap &ldquo;Home&rdquo; and &ldquo;End&rdquo; to beginning and end of line       I've recently gotten a mac and during my coding sessions, I'm really missing the usage of home/end to go to the front/end of each line.  There are various answers to this which talk about creating a .dict file in the Library folder (eg the below) but these don't seem to work in Mountain Lion.  Would someone mind confirming if this should be working, or whether a new method is needed in the new OS?  Remap &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;End&quot; to beginning and end of line  I can't tell if I'm performing the fix incorrectly or the older answer no longer applies on Mountain Lion.   <comment70202> You are not using `Cmd + left arrow` for Home and `Cmd + right arrow` for End? <comment70208> Hi Hoshts.  No, I am constantly toggling between development environments in win and osx, and would like to make the hotkeys consistent.  I've actually found that QuicKeys does the trick nicely - but it's $60 which is a lot for the couple of basic fixes I need. <comment70271> It should still work on 10.8. Did you quit and reopen applications after saving the property list? DefaultKeyBinding.dict is ignored by Xcode, Terminal, and many cross-platform applications.
