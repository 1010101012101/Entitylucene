Use AppleScript to send all emails in a folder at a certain time <body> I'd very much like to please develop an AppleScript to send all emails inside a specific mailbox whenever it is run. Then I can create a mailbox called "9AM", place emails inside there, and with a little help from cron/iCal, have all those emails send at 9am each day allowing me to type emails late at night but have them send in the morning.  My code below however fails on the send command.   precodetell application "Mail"     repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox "9AM" of account "accountnamehere"))         send theMessage     end repeat end tell /code/pre  I also tried moving them to the "Outbox" mailbox but that just seems to make them disappear...  precodetell application "Mail"     repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox "9AM" of account "accountnamehere"))         set mailbox of theMessage to mailbox "Outbox"     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Any suggestions anyone? Help greatly appreciated!  This setup would be ideal as I can just leave a Mac switched on and then even save emails to this "9AM" mailbox from my iPhone. I hope it is possible.  <answer235135> This is not necessarily meant to be a complete answer and is too much as a comment. Because the Mail AppleScript Dictionary lacks some emverbs/em, e.g. codesend again/code, one therefore needs to workaround any shortcomings.  The emcode/em below could be incorporated into your emscript/em. It uses emSystem Events/em to manipulate emmenu/em commands to emsend/em composed messages from the designated emmailbox/em.  strongExample Code:/strong  precodetell application "Mail"     activate     repeat with theMessage in (every message of (mailbox "9AM"))         open theMessage         delay 1         tell application "System Events" to click menu item "Send Again" of menu "Message" of menu bar 1 of process "Mail"         delay 1         tell application "System Events" to click menu item "Send" of menu "Message" of menu bar 1 of process "Mail"         delay 1     end repeat end tell /code/pre  What this does is automate the tasks that one could/would do manually to achieve the same results, sending the unsent saved messages from a given emmailbox/em.  What this doesn't do is, if the emmailbox/em is other then emDrafts/em, remove the messages from the target emmailbox/em and additional coding will be required.  strongNotes:/strong  The problem with automating a series of manual tasks in this manner, aka. UI programming, is if at the designated time the emscript/em runs and you are doing something else and it take focus away from Mail then the emscript/em will not be able to properly complete.  This is because if the Mail menu is not visible then the calls being made by System Events cannot be completed.  The value of the codedelay/code command may need to be adjusted, e.g. codedelay 1.25/code, if required or whatever value works on your system.  Slower systems need higher emdelay/em values.  Obviously if the target emmailbox/em is emDrafts/em keep in mind that unless you emcode/em accordingly all emmessages/em in the target emmailbox/em will be sent and therefore using e.g. "9AM" allows keeping drafts that aren't ready to send from being sent. The disadvantage of other then using emDrafts/em is requiring additional coding to remove the emmessages/em that have now been sent via Send Again  Send in this manner.  <comment286437> It might be more helpful if you'd include the actual error message(s) you're getting. <comment286593> It complains at the "send" command is unknown <comment286602> The _send_ command acts on an _outgoing message_, which is a _new email message_, not one that has been saved to a _mailbox_. If you manually open, double-click, a message in the 9AM _mailbox_ you'll notice two things, there is no _Send message_ icon on the _Toolbar_ and on the _Message_ menu there is no _Send_ command, only _Send Again_ for which there is not a command in the Mail AppleScript Dictionary. <comment286713> Is there please any way to migrate the message back to a send email? <comment286714> I'd be equally happy to have whatever emails are inside my "Drafts" folder to send out at 9am
