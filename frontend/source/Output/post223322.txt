Include keys in Screenium recording <body> Does anybody know how to include the strongkeys pressed during the recording/strong in the movie in Screenium 3?  I'd like to record a tutorial for an app on OS X and include the key combinations pressed when recording the tutorial automatically.  Contacted their supported several times but they're ignoring my support requests.  <comment270756> I don't know if this is a feature in Screenium, but if it's not, you could get around it with something like [Keycastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr#download). <comment271512> Ah! Nice one - I'll try that right away
