Can't colour folders <body> My Mac has ceased to allow me to right click to colour folders in Finder (the Finder format where all opened folders cascade to the right in panels)  I can however right click the general panel area for other functions.   Has anyone encountered this.   It's a small but annoying issue for me.   Please ask questions if I've been unclear about anything.  <comment108712> It sounds like you're talking about Column view. By coloring folders do you mean highlight color, or something else?
