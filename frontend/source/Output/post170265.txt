Apple TV stops playing immediately? <body> I am having an odd issue wherein an Apple TV seems to not play anything.  Sometimes it will play a split second of a show in Netflix or an Airplay'd video, but then immediately stops.  Likewise, the Radio service just simply won't start playing.  Most of the time none of the apps will start playing anything at all.  This seemed to start out of the blue with no apparent provocation or change of settings whatsoever.  I have reset all settings and even updated from 7.0.2 - 7.0.3 to no avail on this issue.  Any ideas as to what may be prompting this kind of behavior?  <comment200136> how is your connection ? <comment200151> @Buscarì›ƒ absolutely fine.  I have no connectivity problems.  I have used both the ethernet connection as well as wireless and they are fine with very solid connectivity.  No packet loss either when pinging to the Apple TV. <comment200152> ok, how is your internet router doing? try pinging google.com for 30 minutes with no packets loss. <comment200157> Router is fine.  0 packet loss.
