Is it possible to charge my MacBook Air from a powerbank? <body> I recently bought a powerbank that has two USB outlets. It's great for charging my phone and iPad. Is it possible to charge my MacBook Air from the powerbank? If it's not possible to do this "out of the box", would it be possible to build or buy something that would enable me to do this?  <answer190386> No. A powerbank is a battery device designed to charge small devices through the USB ports, but not provide the wattage necessary for charging a MacBook's battery.  <answer190388> If your Powerbank has a output for 14.5 Volts (DC) then yes, you can use it with magsafe plug. But not if it has output of 5 Volt (typical output).  There are ways to do it, but would require 5-15 Volt converter including USB to magsafe cable and plug.  There are also car chargers for your MacBook.  Then there is this thing, but at ridiculous cost of $300 and up.  Depending on your GPS location you could consider one of those.  <answer200550> This looks like the best option for changing MBP and MBA at the moment (Aug 2015)  https://www.getbatterybox.com/buy  <answer212270> Yes, I bought this and it works fine:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F00B9A0?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage  and  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0113YERMS?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00  <answer264239> Yes, The answer is positive. The power bank capable to charge a laptop needs to supply not only the USB standard charging port but also (or only) a DC output port, or a build-in power inverter with an AC outlet.

I have seen one on ebay india, and the ad says that they’ve even sold 29 units. These are not marketed by laptop manufacturers so I am not sure what your laptop warranty status will be if you purchase one of these banks and use it charge your laptop. Most laptops charges through its adapter only. Powerbanks on the other hand have only usb 2 output interface. Replacing laptop batteries with Extra cell batteries available in the market can help.
