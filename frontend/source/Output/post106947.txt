OS X Calendar - view shared Google calendars <body> I've been able to add a Google Calendar (CalDAV) account to OS X Calendar (v6, Mountain Lion 10.8.5) without problem, and all my own calendars show up.  Is there a way of seeing calendars others have shared with me (these show up under 'Other Calendars' in the Google Calendar website settings)?  (Same situation on my iPhone.)  <answer106948> Yes, this question is answered by google here:   https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect  You can click on the link and select shared calendars you wanna sync with your device.  <answer281200> You could use a Calendar Program like Informant for macOS. it allows you to combine numerous calendars into a single app.   <comment125497> Thanks - completely missed that… <comment125499> you're welcome. i just had the same problem few days ago. :) <comment268524> I tired your solution, but it does not seem to be working. How long does this change take to take affect? <comment278005> I just tried it and it works perfectly. How long it takes depends on how often Calendar.app refreshes. I have it at 15 minutes, but you can force refresh with ⌘R.
