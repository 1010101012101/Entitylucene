Change OS X Font Rendering to Fit Pixel Grid <body> Until ultra high-res displays are ubiquitous, is there any way to modify the font rendering in OSX to optimise for legibility over faithful type reproduction, i.e. to more closely fit the pixel grid? I find it hard to read text on OS X compared to the same web page rendered on Windows inside Parallels.  Note that LCD font smoothing is enabled under "General" in System Preferences.
