Bootcamp - Your bootable USB drive could not be created <body> I'm trying to install Windows with Bootcamp using my USB drive (16GB). I've downloaded the original ISO (Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit), but when I try to create the bootable USB I always get this message after a couple of minutes:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/idf0E.png" alt="enter image description here"  I've tried to downoad a different ISO of Windows 7 but I got the same message, seems like the problem is not of the iso file. I run Yosemite 10.10.3. I've found this which is the exactly same problem, but the user didn't provided the solution that worked for him...  <comment226049> Where did you download the ISO image from and did you validate the downloaded file against any published checksum? <comment226094> Nope I downloaded it from a site claiming to be the original untouched iso from Digital River in my language.
