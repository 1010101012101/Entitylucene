Clash of Clans and Game Center Issue <body> I downloaded COC ages ago and only did the demo.  Then a month ago I downloaded it again and started playing and am up to Town Hall Level 6.  I didn't realise it had to be attached to the Game Center and indeed when I attempted it it didn't seem to work.  I'm having difficulty with SuperCell support and I can't find the date I originally purchased the app so I can get the vendor of the app (supercell) to help me further.  <comment258835> The day you purchased is i your app store history which is shown in ITunes and the web view of app store <comment258852> I've edited this to have one question (and co-incidentlaly the one that's on topic here). Basic supercell customer support is with them, but if you have a specific article or need help with the Apple side, that's clearly on topic here. Welcome to the QA site.
