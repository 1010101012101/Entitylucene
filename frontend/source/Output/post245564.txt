I am not able to hide the "Split pane bar" in terminal <body> This thing never exited before. All of a sudden it started showing up and I hate it. Can some one help me remove this please. I am running 10.11.5 OS X  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LFz2I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245565> Under the "View" menu select "Close Split Pane" or type kbdshift/kbd-kbdcommand/kbd-kbdD/kbd.  You probably typed kbdcommand/kbd-kbdD/kbd by accident.  <comment302760> This doesn't seem to remove the icon in the scrollbar?! <comment302762> this doesn't remove icon in the scrollbar :(
