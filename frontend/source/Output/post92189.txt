Can I have color ls output automatically if my TERM is "xterm-256color"? <body> Can I have automatic color output for codels/code if my codeTERM/code environment variable is set to codexterm-256color/code?  <answer92192> If you are using bash, you could add codeexport CLICOLOR="YES"/code to your code~/.bashrc/code.  <answer92195> Just for the sake of anyone who might come along and wonder how to restrict this to only when the TERM is a certain value, you could put something like this in your shell's "rc" file (.zshrc or .bashrc etc):  precodecase "$TERM" in       xterm-256color)         export CLICOLOR="YES"     ;;      *color|xterm*)         export CLICOLOR="YES"     ;;      vt100)         export CLICOLOR="NO"     ;;  esac /code/pre  Note that the 2nd example is just there to show why you might want to use 'case' instead of 'if/then': the ability to use wildcard matching and use multiple entries separated by |  <comment108177> GHAAAAA! I set the variable up wrong! I set it to `CLICOLORS`! <comment108178> You can also make use of the `LS_COLORS` var to customize the colors
