How does AppleCare Protection work overseas? (MacBook Pro 13 inch) <body> If I buy an apple laptop overseas can I get the apple protection back in UK?  If I buy the laptop and Apple protection abroad, if something has gone wrong will it be protected when I am back in UK.  <answer184520> Apple Inc. The AppleCare Protection Plan provides global repair coverage.  So yes, you are fully covered.  <comment218793> Yes, I bought my Mac from UK and it had a problem with the ssd and I was in Thailand and they fixed it for free.
