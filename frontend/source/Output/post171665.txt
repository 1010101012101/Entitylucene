Making directories list first in terminal with `ls` <body> Is it possible to make the default of Terminal such that when I use the codels/code command it lists the directories first and then the files?  I figured out that this can be done by using codecoreutils/code and the command codegls --group-directories-first/code, but I was wondering if there was an OS X native way to do this without codecoreutils/code.  <answer171670> The short answer is no. The codels/code shipped with OSX is not the GNU codels/code therefore it doesn't have the same options.   But you can get a similar result with :  precodels -al | sort -k1 -r /code/pre  Ps: I agree that it's far from perfect :)   <comment202023> Thanks for the answer. Do you think there would be a shortcoming of using `gls` instead of `ls` in any situation? <comment202028> I'm using gls (with an alias on ls) for 2 or 3 years right now. It never has been problem. <comment202251> AFAIK, `gls` will miss some [extended file attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes) as the builtin ls. For example, '/bin/ls -d ~/Dropbox' reports `drwx------@` while 'gls -d ~/Dropbox' reports `drwx------` for the permission field.
