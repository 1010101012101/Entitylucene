PC as Bluetooth Headset for iPhone <body> I am trying to set up my computer (running Windows 8.1) as a headset for answering/making calls for my iPhone 4S. I have connected my iPhone through bluetooth, and can listen to music and create keyboard inputs, but cannot use Handsfree!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hf0Mt.jpg" alt="iPhone Bluetooth Connection Page"  I have all of the services enabled for the iPhone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UtEaS.jpg" alt="iPhone Services"  I don't understand why my PC cannot act as a bluetooth headset, as Hands-free is selected! I have the latest bluetooth drivers installed for my computer. My guess is that it may be two drivers not working correctly (seen in Device Manager):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZVMIa.jpg" alt="Device Manager"  Could these two drivers (MAP MAS-iOS and Wireless iAP) not being installed be the cause of the problem? I have been searching for these drivers online and cannot find them.  <answer161359> It turns out that these features are specific to the manufacturers Bluetooth drivers. I was able to find another manufacturers drivers, and they have hands-free as a function:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOkEB.png" alt="Working as headset"  <comment188509> I now understand MAP MAS-iOS is for sending messages, so I guess its not that... <comment188510> It could be specific to my manufacturer's drivers: http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/319533-bluetooth-hands-free-windows-8 <comment284439> Whose drivers did you find that worked? <comment327303> Hi!
