Can Ios 11 beta users update to ios 11 when it comes out? <body> I was wondering if I can upgrade to Ios 11 when it launches while I have the beta of it, or do I have to downgrade?  <answer291152> When you get the Golden Master version of iOS 11, that will be the publicly released iOS 11 . You need not downgrade to iOS 10 to get iOS 11 again.  <answer291171> When the Golden Master version of iOS 11 is publicly released, you will not need to downgrade to iOS 10. The Golden Master version will be the same thing as the publicly released iOS version, give no new bugs are found.  Source: https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Golden_Master
