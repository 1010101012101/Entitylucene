How can I make an external drive behave as an internal drive? <body> My question is pretty much summed up by the title, I have an external drive which I'd like to have recognized as an internal drive. How can I do that? Thanks for looking at my question. By the way I am running 10.11.3 on mbp  <answer231601> I just found this answer, sorry I tried looking first but couldn't find it....  You should be able to do this with dd by setting Removable to False.  Unmount your disk, then runâ€¦  strongdd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1 count=1/strong  Don't forget to replace disk2 with the actual disk identifier.   This command will erase the contents of the disk. Untested, be careful, usual 'not responsible if stuff goes wrong' applies :)  <comment282828> Well first I guess I should say that the drive was empty, but what do you mean by an install, install what? <comment282829> @Gene: Doesn't bs=1 mean 1 byte? And with count=1, wouldn't that mean to just write a value of zero to the first byte of the disk? <comment282831> This answer is probably wrong. Byte 0 (the first byte of the first block is apparently always zero). Additionally this will probably **not** erase your disk! <comment282832> Not sure if this helps, but I tried it and even though I couldn't tell if the drive was erased since it was empty. Disk Utility does label it as an Internal Physical Volume...
