Sharing Hotspot from the mac that the iPhone or iPad can connect with? <body> Is it possible to share a kind of "hotspot" from my macbook so that the iPhone and iPad can connect with it? Just like there is a "personal hotspot" feature on the iPhone I want it the other way around.   The reason I'm asking is that I'm in a room where I have absolutely NO internet. Wheter 3G on my iPhone nor any wireless or ethernet connection.  Is there any chance I can create my own "internal" wireless network outgoing of my mac and connect my iPhone and iPad with it so that it has a regular IP etc.   I need this because I want to demo a Website that is built for mobile devices. I have a local apache server on my mac and usually develop and test with "Adobe Shadow" (meanwhile Adobe Edge Inspect). This works great usuaslly when all my devices are in the same network. However in this room there is no network so I wonder how I could create my own network.  Any ideas about that?  <answer68584> You can create a Personal Network from the AirPort (Wi-Fi) menu.  ol liSelect emCreate Network .../em/li liDefine a name for your Network/li liSelect the channel/li liSelect the security (if selected, define a passphrase/key)/li liClick emCreate/em./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIAC0.png" alt="enter image description here"  In my case I also have to define the IP addresses on the devices.  On your MacBook:  ol liGo to emSystem Preferences/em/li liemNetwork/em/li liSelect the emWi-Fi/em connection/li liClick emAdvanced/em/li liSelect the tab emTCP/IP/em/li liIn the first field select the voice emManually/em/li liSet an IP (e.g. 192.168.1.1)/li liSet a Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0)/li liClick emOK/em/li /ol  On the iOS devices:  ol liGo to emSettings/em/li liemWi-Fi/em/li liClick the blue arrow on the righ of your ad hoc Wi-Fi connection/li liSelect the tab emStatic/em/li liSet an IP (e.g. 192.168.1.2)/li liSet a Subnet Mask (255.255.255.0)/li /ol  <comment96785> I did everything described above, but somehow my devices still will not be able to use the internet connection. The wifi icon is visible in the iphone, however if I try to visit a website or something, I receive a pop-up saying that I have no connection to the internet. Does anybody have some additional tips? Cheers. <comment96797> @marieke1981 The instruction above are not for sharing Internet, but for creating a wireless network. If you want to share Internet connect the Ethernet cable to your Mac. Than go to `System Preferences`-`Sharing` and enable `Internet Sharing`. You have to configure it. It should be easy.
