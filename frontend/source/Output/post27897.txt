Making fonts larger in apps under Lion <body> While there is no system-wide way to make all fonts larger under Lion without leaving native resolution, many individual programs do have a way to make text and various elements larger on the screen. Unfortunately, this varies from one program to the next.  If the goal is to make text appear larger in all programs, can we put together a guide to zooming in the various apps in Lion?  <answer27898> h2iCal/h2  In the strongView/strong menu, select strongMake Text Larger/strong or press kbd⌘/kbd kbd+/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WxBWa.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer27899> h2Finder/h2  Open a Finder window.

Note that text zooming and page zooming are not quite compatible and may cause odd effects when combined so you should stick with either.  h3For All Pages/h3  To make Safari “remember” your text zoom setting, use a custom stylesheet:     1) Create a file named defaultzoom.css (or any name you like, just strongmake sure it has a css extension/strong.)      2) Copy and paste in the following:    precode    body {         zoom: 130%;       } /code/pre      change 130 to whatever number suits you. code&gt;100/code means strongzoom in/strong, code&lt;100/code means strongzoom out/strong. Don't forget the % percent sign!      3) In safari, go to codePreferences &gt; Advanced/code. Under style sheet, select Other... and point to the file you created.      4) You may need to restart safari for the change to take effect.   h3For Certain Websites/h3  Personally, I prefer keeping text zoom level per site with ZoomBySite extension by Ceri Morgan.br It overrides the keyboard shortcuts and remembers the last text zoom level for domain.  <answer28370> h2Reeder/h2  Press kbd⌘/kbd kbd,/kbd to open the Preferences and tweak the strongArticle Font/strong from strongReading/strong tab:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dgB8E.jpg" alt="Reeder Article Font"  <answer28371> h2Twitter/h2  Just open the preferences (kbd⌘/kbd kbd,/kbd) and change strongFont size/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IIgzR.png" alt="Twitter Font size"  <answer28373> h2iTunes/h2  Open the preferences (kbd⌘/kbd kbd,/kbd).
