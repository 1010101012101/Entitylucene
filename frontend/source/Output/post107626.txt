How can I get a photo from an iPad (iOS 5) to my Mac? <body> I am trying to get a photo from my husband's old iPad to my MacBook Pro. I have backed up his iPad to my computer and iCloud, but can't find the photos anywhere? I tried looking for a MobileSync file on my computer, but one doesn't exist. Any ideas?  <answer107640> You can use an app such as strongiExplorer/strong to browse your iTunes backups.  ol liSelect strongExplore iTunes Backups/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jqCc.png" width="500"/li liYour photos will be in strongMediaDomain/strong → strongMedia/strong → strongDCIM/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sko4t.png" width="300"/li /ol
