Applescript to forward email with attachment, and change subject <body> I'm trying to create an applescript that will take messages that match a certain filter YYYY), and forward them to a specific notebook in Evernote (XXXX), with the attachment intact. So far, I've gotten this script to handle the forwarding to a Evernote notebook thing, but I can't seem to get it to deal with attachments correctly.   How do I attach all of the attachments in the emails found by the filter (which would ideally run when messages are received) to the new forwarded email?   precodeusing terms from application "Mail"     on perform mail action with messages selection for rule YYYY         tell application "Mail"             set theSelection to selection             set thesubject to subject of item 1 of theSelection             set theAttachments to every attachment of content of theSelection             set theForwardedMessage to forward (item 1 of theSelection) with opening window              tell theForwardedMessage                 make new to recipient at end of to recipients with properties {address:"ZZZZ"}                  set subject to subject of item 1 of theSelection &amp; " @XXXX"                 repeat with a from 1 to length of theAttachments                     log "message_attachment =" &amp; a                     make new attacment with properties {filename:a} at after last paragraph                 end repeat                 send             end tell         end tell     end perform mail action with messages end using terms from /code/pre
