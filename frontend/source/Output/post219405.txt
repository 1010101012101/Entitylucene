"terminal-notifier.app is not open anymore" <body> From a .plist loaded to codeLaunchd/code I run a bash script which displays a notification using codeterminal-notifier/code.  The notification is displayed fine, but when clicked the message "terminal-notifier.app is not open anymore" pops up.  I tried to set a system app to open with code-sender 'com.apple.Terminal'/code but the error message will still show up.  <comment265349> This does not work for me, too, and I'm not even getting an error message. But: using the switch `-activate com.apple.Terminal` works fine. <comment265350> @Asmus Still not working for me...
