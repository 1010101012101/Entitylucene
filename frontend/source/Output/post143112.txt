How can I copy photos from a Sony mobile phone to iPad? <body> How can I copy Sony mobile phone's photos to iPad?  Note: I have the camera adaptor cable already, that is used to connect to iPad but it doesn't work for Sony XPeria Z mobile phone. When I try to connect, the iPad gives an codeinsufficient power for that device/code error.  <answer143113> AFAIK you can't use the adaptor/cable for this. Alternatively you can email the photos to an account configured on the iPad or install Dropbox on both devices and use this for syncing photos.
