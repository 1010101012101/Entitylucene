Mail in Sierra doesn't group e-mail into threads liked it used to before <body> In Sierra, Mail no longer groups certain e-mail messages into threads.  For example, my Linux home server sends me e-mail reports with the same Subject, from the same e-mail address and these e-mails are always shown as individual entries in the Inbox folder. Before Sierra, all these e-mail messages with identical Subject were grouped into one thread.  I was wondering if there is a way to configure Mail to treat such e-mail liked it used to before Sierra.
