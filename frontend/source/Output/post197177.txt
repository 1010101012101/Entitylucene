How to find command line program with which <body> I am trying to remove all traces of Ureka. I followed the instructions in the link to do this, but when I test if it is gone with code$ur_setup/code I see that the terminal does know what it should be looking for, because it says:  precode-bash: /Users/myname/.ureka/ur_setup: No such file or directory /code/pre  But when I type code$which ur_setup/code nothing is returned. And I have deleted the directory in the above code with  precoderm -rf /Users/myname/code/Ureka rm -rf $HOME/.ureka rm -rf $HOME/.ureka_tmp /code/pre  How can I delete all memory of this program so that terminal does not know where it should look for the program?  As a note, when I code$echo $PATH/code I get:  precode/Users/myname/code:/Users/myname/anaconda/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin /code/pre  <answer197187> Try this:  precodefor i in `echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'`; do     printf "\033[1;103;30m        $i\033[0m\n"     ls "$i" | grep "ur_setup" done /code/pre  This will iterate through directories included in codePATH/code, print them in yellow and then if there's something in there matching emur_setup/em pattern, print it. It can be done cleaner, but it's not worth creating a big function for a small need.  Also, if there's no result from codewhich ur_setup/code (neither codenot found/code nor like code/usr/bin/spiderd/code), you should try codetype which/code.  <answer197191> You removed the application according to the documentation. Now unset the variable ur_setup  precode    unset ur_setup /code/pre  You are good to go.  <comment235723> Between removing Ureka and running `$ur_setup`, did you restart terminal? If not the variable would be in memory… <comment235724> Also, might be worth checking it’s not set in your shells rc file (probably ~/.bashrc or maybe ~/.profile)
