Are Photos from the Photos app in iOS backed up to iCloud? <body> Are Photos from the Photos app in iOS backed up to iCloud? I basically make albums in iPhoto and they are saved in my Photos app on my device. I really hope these are getting backed up to iCloud. Can anyone confirm?  <answer49235> The last 1000 photos and 30 days are, via the photo stream. Apple details here. But this should be seen as a temporary solution.
