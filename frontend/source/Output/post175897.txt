Completely uninstall iOS App and all associated data <body> strongBackground/strong  I am the server side developer working on an API for an IOS app. From time to time as we are in development (when we have big database changes) we reset our server. This process clears all the server side data for a member including any App device tokens used for push notifications.  strongProblem/strong  At the same time as I reset the server database I have been trying to uninstall the app and delete any associated app data. I was hoping that if I did this the next time I install the App it would be like it was a first time download again. This is not working.  strongHow I am doing this:/strong  I have tried the steps listed on the following site https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-devices_organizer/articles/remove_app_from_device.html.  I have also tries uninstalling via the phone:  Under Settings  General  Usage  STORAGE  Manage Storage. I have been clicking on the app and then clicking Delete App;  Under Settings  General  Usage  ICLOUD  Manage Storage. I have been clicking on the current device, then selecting the app and turning off backup and deleting.  I had hoped that this would remove all data so that when I reinstall via Xcode or Test Flight App, the app would start just like a first time user again. However this is not happening, the app still seems to remember some settings, in particular it thinks I have already send my device token and wont prompt me for it again.  strongQuestion/strong  How should I be uninstalling an app form a device so that all app data is removed and the next time a reinstall I am treated as a new user?  <comment207574> Did you reset the device (press and hold Home and Sleep until the Apple logo appears) between deleting the app and reinstalling it? App data is not truly deleted until the device has been reset, and if you reinstall an app before that occurs, it will reuse the old data. <comment207759> Yes, that seems to help with most settings (Not PUSH Notifications). I also had to make sure I was logged out of the app or session information would be stored in the keychain.  I still seem to be having issues with the push notification settings, no matter what I do I cannot make the app think I am a new user and prompt me to resend the device ID to our server. <comment268373> @tubedogg, Reset the device? Wouldn't that delete everything? How would one go about deleting just the app and its data alone?
