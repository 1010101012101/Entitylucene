When ever I press right shift it show Desktop, but in the setting 'Show Desktop' is set to Control Down <body> And when I assign other command to left shift it display error, and when I press the sign it redirect me to the keyboard shortcut, which does not display any conflict...  I just want to use my right shift ToT  <answer19983> I just had the same issue! I am using an external keyboard, btw, but I believe this fix should be the same.  First I just went ahead and restarted, then after my right shift was still acting wonky, I went into the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences, and changed the shortcut to numpad0. I saved it and did a restart again, then it was fixed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ooz1.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm not sure if using the numpad altered the issue, or if all it took was multiple restarts, but before that, even if I disabled "Show Desktop" it would still be active as my Right Shift.  On a weird note, my show desktop used to be a 3 finger swipe down on the trackpad, but now that option isn't even available for me to select. Odd.  <comment22051> This happened to me too. <comment22088> All the gestures changed in Lion. Bit annoying. It's now "spread your fingers" to show desktop. You can also set it to a hot-corner. I know this doesn't answer your question, hope this helps! <comment23246> Upon removing my external keyboard, my right shift went back to showing application windows. I realized that I had to go into "Keyboard Shortcuts" uncheck the application windows shortcut mode, go back into "Mission Control" and once I had deactivated the property in Keyboards, the Mission Control shortcut for the same feature said the shortcut was "Right Shift" (when originally, before I had unchecked the property in Keyboard, it had said Num0.)   Basically, it seems that between "Mission Control" and "Kyboard Shortcuts" there are duplicate settings that DO NOT mirror each other.
