Hide the "Your Apple ID is now being used for iMessage..." message? <body> Is it possible to hide the notification from macs when a new mac is added to the iCloud account? Specifically this one:  "Your apple is is now being used for iMessage and FaceTime on a new Mac"  I'm "running IT" at a small startup, roughly 40 employees, and I want to be logged into iCloud on the administrator account so I can enable Find my Mac in case an employee loses one, or it is stolen.  But I don't want them to receive this pop up every single time I add a new machine to the account.  Or is there a better way to do this?  <comment293175> Don't run everybody on the same Apple ID, that's not what it's meant for. <comment293176> How else can I login and see where all the company macs are? I wouldn't think it would make sense for me to make an apple account for each person. And the machines can move to a new person if someone leaves the company. Then I'd have to manage a lot of apple accounts. <comment293178> You can, in fact, **if you must**, separate iMessage from FMM by signing into the main Apple ID under System Preferences  iCloud and signing in to iMessage under a separate account through iMessage  Preferences. Though, I agree with @Tetsujin that you shouldn't use one Apple ID with multiple devices; it's a headache to manage my own devices together let alone a company of forty computers. <comment293179> Individual user IDs don't scale to a business - see http://www.apple.com/business/dep/
