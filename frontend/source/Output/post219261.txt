Deprecated “natd” and “ipfw” in El Capitan <body> I want to share my internet connection and VPN connection but Tunnelblick/OpenVPN doesn’t play nice with internet connection sharing in OS X.   There was a suggestion on a workaround on how to route all traffic over VPN as per this post: Using (and sharing) a VPN connection on your Mac  The script is:  precode#!/bin/sh  natd -interface tun0 ipfw -f flush ipfw add divert natd ip from any to any via tun0 ipfw add pass all from any to any sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1 /code/pre  I am not a UNIX expert – so I am just wondering if anyone can help me with the alternative for the above deprecated commands please?  <answer219372> I figured it and it seems sharing VPN connection in El Capitan is so much easier than it seems.  In codePreferences -&gt; Network/code click on code+/code and add a VPN (PPTP or L2TP)  In codePreferences -&gt; Sharing/code   ol liSelect (do not check yet), from the codeShare your connection from/code choose VPN connection previously created./li liFrom codeTo computers using/code select codeWi-Fi/code if you connect your computer to internet with Ethernet cable or select codeEthernet/code if you connect your computer to internet with Wi-Fi./li liYou can change codeWi-Fi Options/code from bottom left button./li liNow Check the Internet Sharing from the left menu, and click codeStart/code /li liEvery time you connect the VPN a network will be created and lets you connect to it with any device and use the VPN on you Mac./li /ol  <comment275416> That feature has always been around -- even when the original article was written. That article is specifically about how to setup the internet sharing so that it routes traffic over a tunnelblick style VPN which unfortunately the built in GUI didn't do then, and still doesn't do in Capitan so this does not answer the question asked. <comment275712> I myself asked the question and the answer is OK with me. I wanted to share the VPN connection and it did do that.
