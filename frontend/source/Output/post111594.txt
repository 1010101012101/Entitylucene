Copy Text from Quicklook <body> In previous versions of OS X a plist addition to codecom.apple.finder/code (outlined here for instance) could be used to enable select and copy in quicklook previews.  This (hidden) feature doesn't appear to work anymore in Mavericks. Any workarounds? Or is the setting merely named differently?  <answer111650> Running  precodedefaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true /code/pre  and relaunching applications works for me. codedefaults write com.apple.finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool true/code only applies to Finder but codedefaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true/code applies to all applications.  If it doesn't work, see what Quick Look generator handles plain text files:  precode$ qlmanage -m|grep public.plain-text   public.plain-text -&gt; /System/Library/QuickLook/Text.qlgenerator (555.0) /code/pre  If it is not codeText.qlgenerator/code, try to delete it and run codeqlmanage -r/code.  <answer140804> Please notice that the activation of the "Text-Selection-In-Quicklook"-Feature could lead to the bug described in this question:   QuickLook blanks when displaying some images  <comment131280> Deleting the third party generator and running `qlmanage -r` worked. Thanks. <comment131281> Awesome! thank you for this tip <comment147344> Doesn't work for me with `qlmanage -p` on 10.8.5. <comment147353> @Dominique Did you run `defaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true`? `defaults write com.apple.Finder QLEnableTextSelection -bool true` only applies to Finder and not to `qlmanage`. <comment147460> Yes I did. I think this trick works when you use QuickLook from the Finder, but not when you call `qlmanage -p` from the command line. <comment166324> I'm using 10.9 Running defaults write -g QLEnableTextSelection -bool true does not work for me
