Strange behaviour of window.location in safari (in Tampermonkey script) <body> I recently did a clean install of El Captian &amp; added Tampermonkey into my safari. Youtube had evolved a lot since its inception and, personally, I found the homepage had become quite shitty so I used the snippet of code in my Tampermonkey script below to redirect the homepage to the subscription page  precodefunction jump(nwl){     if(nwl=="https://www.youtube.com/"){     window.location = "https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions";     }else if(nwl!=wl){       do_removeRecommendation();       wl =  nwl;     }     if(nwl=="https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions"){        removeWatched();     }     if(nwl=="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager"){         GM_addStyle('#masthead-appbar-container { display: none !important; }'            );     }  } jump(window.location.href); setInterval(function(){     jump(window.location.href); },1000); /code/pre  Back when I was using Yosemite this worked pretty well in my chrome. But I am switching to safari now &amp; this is what happens when I accident go to the youtube homepage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZ89P.jpg" alt="youtube has a shitty homepage"  It bloody changed the location of some iframe which made no sense.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tZftD.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Although if we refresh the page, it would then redirect to https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions quite nicely.  <comment252618> As this is part of a larger script, I couldn't reproduce your problem. But: Can you try inserting the line `if (window.top !== window || document.hidden) return;` as the second line in your snippet? (i.e. as the first line in the `jump` function.
