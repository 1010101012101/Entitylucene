Updating OpenSSL in OSX <body> I am using 10.9 with Server app 3, and right now i am using an obsolete connection with TLS 1.0, RSA and AES_128CBC with HMAC-SHA1 (that cames by default).  While i was trying to upgrade openssl, i notice that when i tried to upgrade it says that openssl is not installed but it is.  precoderemote:~ root# port upgrade openssl Error: openssl is not installed remote:~ root# openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015 /code/pre  So i would like to know how can i upgrade it, and why is not being detected as installed?  <answer262379> OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 14 July 2015 is the version installed by OS X 10.9(.5) (Mavericks) and resides in /usr/bin/.  MacPorts neither installs nor updates/upgrades genuine Apple (OK, OpenSSL is not Apple but it's part of their basic BSD package) system software. MacPorts' standard realm is /opt/...  You would have to stronginstall/strong a newer OpenSSL version with MacPorts - if available.  <comment328690> Thanks for the response klanomath! I have tried to install openssl through mac ports but now i am having an issue with linking to new openssl from macports instead of the old one who came with OS X. It simply doesnt link. I have done dorlandode answer here and nothing (i dont have dotnet in this system so didnt run that last line): https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/597 <comment328691> @SipriusPT dorlandode's answer (or receipt) is (or works) for the homebrew (also a OS X package manager) installed openssl only. You have to search in a MacPorts forum for a proper answer how to link openssl libs. <comment328693> Ah i yes my mistake i said mac ports instead of brew. I will do that. Thanks again!
