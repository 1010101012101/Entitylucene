Connecting my Time Capsule to an Existing Network <body> I will be living in a basement apartment without physical access to the router and only wireless internet access. I am trying to figure out a way (any way!) to use my Time Capsule, but it seems to be impossible to connect to an existing network.  I've tried using the Add to Existing Network option in setup (like seen here: http://pinoyitsolution.com/2013/12/07/how-to-add-airport-time-capsule-to-existing-network-on-osx-10-9-mavericks/#.U-_iHkhgoy4 , but rather than the "Select Existing Network" option as seen in step #5, Airport Utility says the Time Capsule is creating a new network and asks me to name the network, the base station, and create a password (this is even though I am certain I've selected "Add to Existing Network" from the "Other Options" button). I've tried searching, but most results are from several years ago. Is this an option that has changed or been removed from new Time Capsules?  I am using a brand-new MacBook Pro and brand-new Time Capsule, both purchased just a month ago from the Apple Store.
