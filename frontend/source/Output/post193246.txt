Safari used 70 GB of RAM <body> Safari uses too much memory on my system (rMBP 2013). By 'too much' I mean tens of gigabytes of memory. I experience constant memory pressure which leads to Safari freezes (it's freezing constantly even now while I'm typing this, and I have a single tab opened). It doesn't stop using memory until the entire SSD is full.  ul liThe are no extensions installed (they are disabled in fact)./li liI can't tell whether the issue is caused by any particular website; sometimes it happens when I don't have any seemingly "heavy" websites open./li /ul  How do I resolve this issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LBXWC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer193247> There are a number of things you can try...  ol liSometimes applications have memory leaks where the memory bloats over time, if you've been using Safari heavily, or using it for a long time without exiting and rebooting this could be an issue.

That would narrow it down to any Safari plug-in or extension unique to the regular User Account. So i would suggest you to focus on extensions first. If you have one or more extensions installed follow these steps.  Open Safari PreferencesExtensions and disable each extension by clicking on the extension, then unchecking the "enable" box. Then, restart Safari.  If performance improves, then return to Safari Preferences and enable one or two extensions. Restart Safari. If CPU activity is normal, then continue down the list following the above sequence until you find what causing this issue.  As with any major OS or application update, it's up to the 3rd party developer to bring their product into compliance with new system requirements.  <comment230219> Does this occur only in your user account or with another account as well? Which extensions do you have installed, do you visit pages with plugins (e.g. Flash)? Does Safari need 70 GB right after starting or only after some time/if you visit specific sites? <comment230220> There is a single user account on my system. The are no extensions installed (they are disabled in fact). I do visit Youtube, Google Drive, Gmail, other Google services; as well as many other services (StackOverflow, Basecamp, Jira, etc). I can't tell whether the issue is caused by any particular website; sometimes it happens when I don't have any seemingly "heavy" websites open. <comment230235> 1. Not the case; 2. No extensions and plugins except for Adobe Flash; 3. I'll try a clean system install I guess. <comment230236> I don't have any extensions installed (there are disabled). <comment230240> Before you do that, try cleaning out Safari's preferences in your user directory.
