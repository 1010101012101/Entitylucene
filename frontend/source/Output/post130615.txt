How to inherit ACL's/permissions automatically when creating new folder using Finder? <body> We are using an Iomega file storage which is connected to our network. Our Windows Domain Controller is creating a share to this file storage, so our Windows users can easily access the share using \domaincontroller\share  When those users create a new folder, the file/directory permissions are inherited from the parent's folder. Everybody can read/write in their newly created folders, which is perfect.  When a Mac user (which is directly accessing the file storage) is creating a new folder, special permissions (read/write for current user) are applied and no else can write files in this newly created folder. The only way to solve this, is to RDP to a Windows console and reset the ACL's.  What's the best practice to solve this problem?  <answer130627> By default, Active Directory objects inherit ACEs from the security descriptor located in their parent container object. Inheritance enables the access control information defined at a container object in Active Directory to apply to the security descriptors of any subordinate objects, including other containers and their objects. This eliminates the need to apply permissions each time a child object is created.   If necessary, you can change the inherited permissions. However, as a best practice, avoid changing the default permissions or inheritance settings on Active Directory objects. For more information, see Best practices for assigning permissions on Active Directory objects and Changing inherited permissions.  <comment153179> Our Storage is writing the ACLs automatically for the OS X Clients by simply setting the owner/group to "admin:administrators". The ACLs are controlled via an AD. That works for us and all folders have the right permissions automatically. <comment153181> Can you tell me where in AD you configure this? Seems exactly what we need <comment153182> Btw, we are using an old Windows 2003 server (SBS) <comment153272> You said "directly accessing." What does that mean, e.g. connection protocol, storage format, etc.?  @YoshiBotX Learning AD at the moment.  I'd love to learn how to control ACL's via AD. :) <comment153283> I mean: Finder  CMD + K  SMB://#NAME_OF_MY_FS <comment153284> Yes, I can do that, but then I have to inherit the permissions each time manually, when I create a new folder? I want this process to be automized ...
