Force boot usb in erased macbook <body> Out of frustration from Yosemite, I booted macbook in recovery mode, and erased the Macintosh drive from my retina macbook pro 13 inch. But I am not able to boot into ubuntu usb installer I made earlier. If I keep the alt key pressed while booting, macbook shows "Internet Recovery" option, on clicking, shows "24 hours" in text. How do I force boot into usb?  <comment191790> Did you test the USB key *before* erasing the drive? <comment191794> did not test this usb. What do I do now?! <comment191795> Find another computer to make an *actual* bootable USB drive fromâ€¦ or reboot with Cmd/R held & allow Internet Recovery to do its job.
