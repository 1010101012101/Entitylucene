Disable sparsebundle backups on Network-attached time machine (Lion)? <body> I am running OS X Lion/10.7.4 and have set up a network disk hosted on an Ubuntu server using directions I found online. Time Machine recognizes the disk and backs up to it. However it backs up as sparsebundle "bands" files. I would like to be able to read the backed-up files from the Ubuntu server.   Is there any way to tell Time Machine to back up to regular files stronginstead of/strong using sparsebundle/bands files?  <answer70302> I found a github project a short time ago, which handles the "read the backed-up files" part of this question:  https://github.com/torarnv/sparsebundlefs  That is good enough for my purposes.  <comment71938> short answer, no.
