.DS_Store creation disabled on network shares, but I want them enabled for a specific share <body> I use my Mac in a corporate Windows environment all the time, and have it set so that it doesn't drop .DS_Store turds all over the network.  I used the following well-known terminal command to disable it:  precodedefaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true /code/pre  However, I also have a server at home as well as a Time Capsule, and I would like the .DS_Store file created on those shares.  Is there any way to make an exception to the rule?  I'm running Mavericks BTW.  <answer137353> I don't think you can have it both ways.   I can imagine a bit of a work around that involves the Mac knowing what network it is on, and then changing the defaults write command to match the network. Something like http://www.controlplaneapp.com/about/ would help you get that done.  (not the simplest solution I'll admit)  <comment162400> *How* have you set it? App or Terminal command? <comment162403> Using the terminal: `defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true`
