iPhone 6 volume too loud on Bluetooth headphones <body> I have insomnia and use the sound therapy app Digipill to help me fall asleep. I've started to use its sounds through Bluetooth headphones, but I've come across an issue. A low setting on the iPhone's volume slider (~20%) is still insanely loud (hurts my ears) and if I slide the volume down to what should be the lowest setting then there is no sound whatsoever.   So how can I get sound through my BT headphones at a not-deafening volume?  strongThings I've tried, not necessarily in this order:/strong  ol liabout 30 different brands/models of bluetooth headphones. From Best Buy legit high dollar brand name as well as Amazon/eBay cheap imports. All do the same thing./li liMusic settings: EQ trying each type of setting option, Volume Limit specifying a Max volume that's as low as possible, Sound Check on/of. I've done every possible combination with no effect on the volume./li liReturned my new iPhone and got a replacement NEW iPhone, not refurbished. So this is not isolated to just my iPhone or another refurbed iPhone./li liAlso have tried on an iPad 2nd generation, iPad Air, iPad Pro, iPad Mini 4... pretty much if you know me &amp; have an Apple product I was trying it to see if it had the same issues./li liDownloaded/purchased the app on craigslist's iPod Touch &amp; synched quite a few of these bluetooth headphones. Same issues, no change./li liIn Settings used the "disability section" Accessibility's Hearing options: Mono Audio, Noise Cancellation, Hearing Devices and doing Hearing Aid Mode "on". /li liONLY THING THAT HAS HELPED is in the Accessibility shifting the audio balance to 75% in one ear &amp; NOT using that side of the headphones, strongNOT A VIABLE SOLUTION/strong since I am using the hypnotherapy app to cover up noise &amp; aide me in falling back asleep./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B95bD.jpg" alt="Playing" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SKJH.jpg" alt="Not playing"  <comment346706> I assume you've tried cycling through play/pause? It's unclear because the image with "Sound playing" is paused and the image with "no sound playing" is not paused. Comment back `@owlswipe` and I'd be happy to try to help more! <comment346709> Also, is the sound only deafening from the Digipill app, or is music played through the Music app deafening as well? Basically, is this a problem with Digipill audio or with all audio? <comment346883> Sorry I paused it since I couldn't hear anything. I've tried cycling through but haven't seen any change in the volume. <comment346884> Also while in the music app it functions fine as long as I am using the "volume limit" option. I believe that is due to it being an music app while my DigiPill is an audio app or possibly not even specified as a type of app. I'm not sure how the apps/classification/developing works. <comment346949> Sounds like a weird bug. Was Apple support really not able to fix it? <comment346950> Also try turning the volume down from the BT headphones themselves?
