How to reset Apple ID PW without knowing original PW and answer to security question? <body> I cannot use iCloud since I forgot the password for my MACBookPro original APPLE ID. The email address associated with this ID is no longer valid and the security question was never set up. How do i reset the password? I want to change the ID and use new PW to access icloud.  <answer151194> "If you forgot your Apple ID password" on Apple's support website provides the steps to reset your password, however you have stated you do have not access to the original email address and a security question was not set up.  Therefore you will need to contact Apple directly. "Contacting Apple for help with Apple ID account security" provides a country-by-country list of contacts for Apple ID password issues.  <comment276196> I can't see why this was closed - the user is asking a very straightforward "how do I" question. They were not seeking a comparison or recommendation. <comment305542> Also see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/60656/how-can-i-reset-the-answers-of-the-security-questions-of-my-apple-id
