Moving the Caret with OS X Text Substitution <body> You can set up text substitutions in OS X in the Languages and Text tab of System Preferences.  Is there a way to choose where the caret will appear after a text substitution takes place?  For example, when I type codethx/code I want it to expand to codeThank you |./code where the code|/code character represents where I would like the caret to be after the text has been substituted.  Right now when I set the shortcut codethx/code to expand to codeThank you ./code, and I type codethx/code, it gets replaced with codeThank you . |/code  <answer93277> I don't think it's possible. You might add a snippet like this in TextExpander though:  precodeThank you %|. /code/pre  Or use DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "\UF704" = { // F1         "t" = {             "h" = {                 "x" = (insertText:, "Thank you .", moveBackward:);             };         };     }; } /code/pre  <comment109450> Thanks for the link, looks very interesting.
