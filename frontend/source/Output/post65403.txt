Transparent PNG photo shape creator on iPad <body> I have searched high and low looking for an app that will do a very specific thing.  I want to take a photo from my camera roll, apply a pre created shape mask to it (not freeform) and then save it back to the camera roll with a transparent background.  It appears that the iPad camera roll does not handle transparent .png files so well, it adds white where the transparency would be.  I have tried photoshop touch as well as a handful of other apps - but nothing seems to work.   I know I can do it on a Mac, but I am looking for a mobile solution.   Can someone please please help me.  <answer87447> This App will allow you to make parts of a photo transparent then save to your camera roll. You will have to draw the shape or use the simple tools to create the mask.  Works well for me as I usually want to remove the background. Not sure of the file format but they are transparent and are great to add to things like Keynote.  https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/background-eraser-for-ipad/id532187687?mt=8  <comment102455> Accepted and appreciated.
