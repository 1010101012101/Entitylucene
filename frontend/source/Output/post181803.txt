Moving iTunes folders from W7 to W 8.1 <body> I can't seem to get any of the myriad of approaches offered by Apple's sites, or others, to successfully get my 80gb of iTunes files moved from a Windows 7.0 to 8.1 PC. Using a Toshiba 500gb usb hard-drive for transfer, The best I've been able to do is get the raw songs transferred, but they all carry the transfer date, all playlists are lost etc.   Some of my confusion vs guidelines I read are: My previous iTunes library contains 17 itl files each with a different date; I find no folder named iTunes Media Files, rather in 7.0 iTunes  I have iTunes Music, Previous iTunes Libraries and others like album artwork, ipod games and Mobile apps, last three of no interest. iTunes Music contains all the albums, plus one preferences file with a .plist extension.   Does anyone have a straightforward way to get what I have on my W7.0 computer to present all the same information to the ITunes on my 8.1 computer?
