Macbook Air Mid 2013 Mini Display to VGA Issue <body> I bought new macbook air and mini display to vga cable. When I connect to external monitor, air doesn't recognize it. I tried different external monitors with different cable, same result. My friend also has macbook air and he connect to external monitor with my cable. What is the problem ?
