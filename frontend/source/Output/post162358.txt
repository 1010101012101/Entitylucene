`find` finds nfs server? <body> I had to run codefind / -name foo &gt; found.txt/code and stumbled over the following output:  precode... find: /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/mac/2014-12-17-162004/MacRoot/.DocumentRevisions-V100: Permission denied nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: not responding nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: is alive again nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: not responding nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: is alive again nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: not responding nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: is alive again nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: not responding nfs server localhost:/FjbUHyS_WAWZQyX9SZ1Wx9: is alive again find: /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/mac/2014-12-17-162004/MacRoot/System/Library/DirectoryServices/DefaultLocalDB/Default: Permission denied ... /code/pre  I'm not using NFS nor have I ever mounted a NFS volume. Where is this coming from?  <answer162396> Mac OS is runnning Time Machine backups for you, even if your Time Machine disk is not connected. The backup directory is automatically created and mounted as a network share via NFS at the /Volumes/Mobilebackups directory.  This is not a backup in the disaster recovery sense, but it will allow you to restore older versions of your files, if you by accident delete a file or regret an edit you did. Supposedly it will consume a lot of disk space, but only as long as there's at least 20 % free space.  Disable the service with this terminal command if you dont like it:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  To see the NFS path, run the mount command. Optionally "mount -a" to show all volumes.  I believe the physical location of the backups is i /.Mobilebackups but I'm not quite sure.  And according to Apple docs, the find command should take an option "-fstype" with the special value "local" to stay within the same file system, thus avoiding mounted network shares etc. (Not tested - have no access to a Mac system right now).  precodefind / -fstype local -name foo /code/pre  *)https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/find.1.html   <comment189906> but how do I see the link/share? `ls -l /Volumes/` shows it as a normal folder: `drwxrwxrwx  0 root  wheel  0 Dec 17 20:55 MobileBackups`
