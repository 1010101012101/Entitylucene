Applescript: How to move a file after finishing processing it? <body> I'm very new to writing applescript, but have been painfully working through it.   I have successfully written scripts to download specific csv attachments from an email inbox, then create an SQL insert statement from them. I'm now trying add a statement to move the original file to an archive folder so the SQL insert script does not act on those files the next time it runs. The variable"DEP_name" is the name of the file captured earlier in the script:  precode        tell application "Finder"             set orgpath to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:source_folder:" as string             set originalFolder to (orgpath &amp; DEP_name) as string              set newpath to "Macintosh HD:Users:me:Documents:Archive:" as string             set newFolder to (newpath &amp; DEP_name) as string              move originalFolder to newFolder with replacing         end tell /code/pre  With this version I get the error: "Finder got an error: AppleEvent handler failed." I have also tried using the Posix file path, but I am getting a different error with that attempt. Any help would be appreciated.  <answer211072> Change the second to last line to:  precodemove alias originalFolder to alias newpath with replacing /code/pre  There are two things:  ol liAll four variables are just strings. In order to tell Finder that they are related to the filesystem, add codealias/code (or codefile/code or codefolder/code) before the string./li liThe path where are are moving it to should be the path of the enclosing folder, not the path of the moved folder in its new location./li /ol
