Pastebot Mac software says Disabled in menu <body> I don't use Pastebot on this computer very often, but it has worked previously without difficulty.  Today, the menu shows "Disabled..." in grey text, and Pastebot doesn't allow me to copy &amp; paste between Mac and device.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/12N9w.png" alt="Pastebot Mac menu"  ul liI downloaded the Mac preference pane and installed it again.  This seemed to work OK, although there were two messages about "... is from an unidentified developer", to which I said Open./li liI followed the Pastebot process to pair my new iPad 4, and this seemed to work OK: the numeric password showed up on the Mac, and I typed it.  But I still see Disabled in the Mac menu bar, and it doesn't seem to sync./li liThis was working previously with my iPhone 4S, but it doesn't now./li liPastebot is turned on in the Mac pref pane./li liThe Firewall is turned off on the Mac./li liThe Pastebot support site doesn't seem to mention this possibility./li liI can't see any relevant messages in Console.app./li liEverything else about the Mac, iPad, iPhone seems to be working OK./li /ul  Any ideas how I might get Pastebot working again?  <answer93965> Well, the answer was right in front of me, but I didn't see it.  To fix this problem, choose the first item in the menu: "Enable Pastebot Sync".  Duh!  <comment109050> Soo... What's the problem? <comment109056> @Undo Sorry... I've tried to clarify: see my edits. <comment109058> Much better. Can't help, though.
