Is there a command-line BitTorrent client preinstalled on OS X? <body> On a "bare" OS X 10.8 install, what is the easiest way to grab a largish torrent from the command line (MacTeX, 2.3 GB)? I can't use GUI-only clients, it's a headless system. If no such client is preinstalled, which one would be easiest to install and get running?  strongEDIT/strong: To be more specific, I'm looking for a command similar to codewget/code or codecurl/code that would get a torrent and serve only this torrent while running, then exiting when the download is complete.  <answer108162> No, not pre-installed as far as I know.  hr  Try strongDeluge/strong.     It has been designed using the client server model with a daemon process that handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely from any platform.   supSource: About Deluge/sup  Alternatively, try rTorrent, strongaria2/strong, or TorrentFlux.  For simple downloading of .torrent or magnet torrents, aria2 might be your best option.  hr  emSetting up aria2:/em  ol liInstall aria2 per the official install instructions./li liaria2 can accept .torrent links and magnet links:  precodearia2c http://example.org/mylinux.torrent aria2c 'magnet:?xt=urn:btih:248D0A1CD08284299DE78D5C1ED359BB46717D8C' /code/pre/li /ol  hr  emSetting up Deluge console access:/em  ol liInstall Deluge per the official install instructions./li liRun the daemon and the console process, then connect locally.  precodedeluged deluge-console connect 127.0.0.1:{{DELUGEDPORT}} /code/pre/li liAdd a torrent per this syntax:  precodeadd [-p &lt;save-location&gt;] &lt;torrent-file&gt; [&lt;torrent-file&gt; ...] /code/pre/li liUse code--help/code flag for more help on commands./li /ol  emSetting up Deluge remote access:/em  ol liInstall Deluge per the official install instructions./li liCreate the configuration files by starting/stopping the daemon:  precodedeluged pill deluged /code/pre/li liAdd authentication with the syntax code&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;:&lt;level&gt;/code:  precodeecho "alice:MyC0mpL3xPass:10" &gt;&gt; ~/.config/deluge/auth /code/pre  supAbout authentication levels/sup/li liAllow connections beyond codelocalhost/code.  precodedeluge-console "config -s allow_remote True" deluge-console "config allow_remote" /code/pre/li liStart the daemon.  precodedeluged /code/pre/li /ol  emSetting up rTorrent:/em  ol liInstall rTorrent per the official download &amp; install instructions./li liRun codertorrent/code to begin the interactive access.

Looks like the best option for me, too -- I can even install from homebrew. Let's see...
