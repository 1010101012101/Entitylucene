How do I install Jalmus? <body> I am trying to install this music reading software: http://www.jalmus.net/Download.html  I downloaded it and double clicked on it and went through the installer. Now there's a file in my Applications folder (OS X) with a bunch of folders in it but no application to run. What else do I need to do? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4EJMH.png" alt="My applications"  <answer283754> The application is probably in code.../bin/code. You can either start it from there or (according to the instructions on the Jalmus website) from the commandline.  <comment357801> What is in `bin`? <comment357802> Also, according to the instructions on the website you need to start it from Terminal <comment357803> Ok, nice! I had to launch it from bin. Thank you
