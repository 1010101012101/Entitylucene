How do disable light-speed slideshow of photos when importing into iPhoto from iOS device? <body> When importing photos from an iOS device into iPhoto (v9.6 if it matters), iPhoto displays each picture in its window one picture at a time (each for a fraction of a second), like a nervous fast-forwarded slideshow or something, presumably as each photo is imported. I suppose someone might want this feature, but I find showing me each photo for 1/10th of a second to be ridiculous. Displaying the first few thumbnails and a progress bar seems sufficient.   Anyway: clearly, I could just hide the window or something, and clearly some thumbnails will be displayed, but strongis there a way to disable the individual/sequential display of pictures as they are being imported into iPhoto?/strong I see no options for "import" in the Preferences dialog, nor when the device is plugged in, and my best web-search-fu yields only information on how-to-import or deleting.  Maybe this "feature" cannot be changed, and I'm the only one that doesn't want it.  Like, if I'm syncing photos in the background at a cafe or something, I don't want some random person looking over my shoulder to see 100 pictures of my cat[sup1/sup] chasing a laser pointer[sup2/sup] or whatever as I was trying to get That Perfect Picture or something.  hr  sub Footnotes: br/sup1/sup I do not have a cat. br/sup2/sup I have never done this[sup3/sup]. br/sup3/sup But I emhear/em that it's fun...? /sub
