Toolbar Button for Chrome DevTools <body> anybody know any way of creating/putting an icon/button in google chrome's toolbar that will open its built-in Developer Tools?  i know there are keyboard shortcut options, menu bar options, secondary-clicking within webpage option, &amp; the 3lined icon at the far right of chrome's toolbar. but i'm wanting a simple button, single click, to open it.  i've also scoured google chrome extensions &amp; have come up empty.  thanks.
