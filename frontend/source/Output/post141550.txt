Identify iPad generation by box pictures <body> I found an auction, where someone put a new unpacked device in iPad 1st generation section for corresponding price of iPad 1, while its clear that it is not iPad 1 just by looking at 1st photo included.br The person selling the device didn't write any other informations beside that it has 16GB HDD and is brand new.br I have tried to contact the seller to confirm if this is 4th generation iPad or not, but did't receive any answer from him/her so far.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8GeNt.jpg" alt="Front" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H2Tox.jpg" alt="Side" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4jx8Q.jpg" alt="Front" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V5tBx.jpg" alt="Side"  Unfortunately seller didn't include photo of box back.(2nd photo shows "layout" of labels on it, but text itself cannot be read)   Now lets become Sherlock Holmes :)  ol li1st photo shows front of the box, which may belong to any Apple tablets, besides 1st generation which were packed in different boxes with Ipad picture on top, in almost 1:1 scale  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fn3rc.jpg" alt="Ipad 1"/li li2nd photo shows us, that this is Ipad, not Ipad Air or Ipad mini./li liOn 4th photo we can see Apple logo. 3rd generation has ICloud logo instead. So we now know this is either 2nd or 4th generation :)/li liThere is also one more detail on 4th photo. Apple logo is silver. If am not wrong 2nd gen box has black apple logo instead.  For 90% this is 4th generation, but not sure. Can you help me decide if this actually ipad 4th by looking at photos above?:)/li /ol  <answer141551> That's an iPad 4 box. You can tell it by the ios5 wallapaper. The ipad 2 has a iOS 4 wallpaper.   Your 3rd point is true : Only the iPad 3 have the iCloud logo.  Your 4th point if false. iPad 2 have also a silver Apple logo on their boxes.   <comment265483> @grgarside - I have to beat last year's figure of 20 & I always did like Tom Baker ;-)
