Installation of Office 365 for Mac is freezing at "Running Package Scripts" (Sierra) <body> I just downloaded codeOffice 365 for Mac/code, and tried to install it in codemacOS Sierra 10.12.5/code. The installation froze when codeRunning Package Scripts/code.  It is a common problem. I followed this answer and launched codeDisk Utility/code, but it seems that there is no coderepair disk permission/code in Sierra.  Then, I found the answer of dianeoforegon here. I did pay attention to close all browsers and applications (except codeFinder/code) before launching the installer. Clicking on codeShift/code did not help either.  It is really annoying. Does anyone have a solution? Otherwise, how could I clean what I have installed completely?  strongEdit 1:/strong I chatted to Microsoft support yesterday, and they let me create a new user account on my Mac, and install Office 365 under that account. I tried, the installation was freezing at the same place.  strongEdit 2:/strong I chatted to another Microsoft support agent, he suggested me to remove the Office before installing, I then removed them in codeApplications/code, there was no codeLibrary/Containers/code or codeLibrary/Group Containers/code (I guess it is because the installation was not completed). And the re-installation still failed at the same place.  Additionally, I have to use VPN to connect to the internet, some sites still don't work well. Is this an issue? Does codeRunning Package Scripts/code require some special Internet connection?  <answer285546> The first thing I would try is booting into Safe Mode and installing Office 365 from there. This is what I emthink/em the answer of dianoforegon you referred to was trying to achieve, but her steps weren't the best way to go. Instead, try the following:  ol liFully shut down your Mac/li liRestart your Mac/li liImmediately press the kbdShift/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key when you see the login window (NOTE: If you have FileVault enabled you may need to log in twice. Also, booting into Safe Mode can take quite a while in some cases.)/li liNow try installing Office 365 again from your download/li liIf it doesn't work, take a note of any errors etc you get/li liExit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac as normal/li /ol  Let me know if this doesn't work and any error you get.  <comment360142> Is this a totally fresh installation (i.e. no prior installation of Office 365)? If so, as far as you can tell, has anything been installed at all? <comment360166> Thank you... The booting into Safe Mode took 10 minutes, then I could finally launch the installer. The installation was freezing at the same place (running package scripts)... <comment360167> There was for example Microsoft Excel previously installed, and I don't remember other applications. I don't know how to check if anything new has been installed. If I look at the `Date Modified` in `Applications`, I don't see any `Microsoft xxxxx` whose `Date Modified` is yesterday.
