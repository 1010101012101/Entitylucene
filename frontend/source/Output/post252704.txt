Can I disable receiving "effects" in iOS 10 Messages? <body> For reasons past comprehension, the new iOS 10 Messages app allows applying "effects" to messages. I understand that I can disable the ability to emgenerate/em these abominations by choosing     Settings  General  Accessibility  Reduce Motion   Will this also (please!) disable their emreceipt/em?  <answer252720> Disabling that feature will result in a text-only message accompanying the message where the effect was sent stating, e.g.     (sent with Slam Effect)   This replaces the effect being generated.  <comment314443> So if someone sends me a message with a "Slam Effect" — God, I remember when I thought we were going to use all this tech to go to Mars and solve poverty! — and I've turned on "Reduce Motion", I'll just see that parenthetical taunt, and no actual "effect", right? <comment314448> Correct. ------ <comment323334> [This no longer works in 10.1.](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/258620/4395) <comment323379> True, but the new setting is literally directly below that. <comment323380> The new setting doesn't do what the old one did. The old on prevented *generating* effects too. <comment323381> This question was about preventing receipt of them. <comment323383> Yes, it stays accepted and upvoted for that reason. It no longer solves the premise of the question though, that there is a setting for disabling their generation (it seems). <comment323384> I believe the premise is flawed, in that there is a very simple solution: just don't send them. You have to go through several steps to send them. It's not as if you can do it by accident. Why should there be a setting to prevent you from doing something that you have to actively choose to do in the first place? <comment323386> I'm not sure what's confusing you here. The question contains the statement  "I understand that I can disable the ability to generate these", so that's part of the premise. Whether that should be expected is not relevant.
