How to get keychain to leave me alone? <body> I've tried everything with keychain, and I can't get it to just leave me alone. It pops up and says it can't find a keychain to store something, giving me choices like "cancel" or "reset to defaults".  If I try "cancel", the same dialogue box pops up immediately. If I try "reset to defaults" it asks for my login password. I enter it, it tells me that it wants to use the "Local Items" keychain, asking for a password.  At this point I can enter a password (which it tells me is wrong) or click cancel which starts the loop over again.  Is there a way to get keychain to just leave me alone, always? Chrome does fine with my passwords, I don't think I need Apple to be involved in this at all.  <answer180086> This problem was with the "local items keychain". I found the following here and it worked for me:  Follow these steps to prevent prompts to unlock the Local Items keychain.  ol liIn Finder Select Go  Go to folder (⇧⌘G)/li liIn the window that appears, type the following: ~/Library/Keychains//li liClick OK./li liLook for a folder with a name similar to this "A8F5E7B8-CEC1-4479-A7DF-F23CB076C8B8".  Note: Each folder has a unique number./li liMove this folder to the Trash./li liImmediately choose Apple Menu ()  Restart… to restart your Mac./li /ol  After restarting the computer, a new folder is created in the Keychains folder with a name similar to "4B29A0BB-599D-47FC-A2D1-42B5592B130B". There is no need to repeat the steps in this article, or to delete this folder. The new folder is expected and corrects the symptom described in this article.  <comment213638> The keychain is used for more than internet passwords. Some of the answers here might help: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/167689/whats-the-password-to-the-system-keychain?rq=1 <comment213640> What events|sites|activities are causing the problem? Some responses may be just a one-time thing, but without more detail about those things that are popping up, there's not much anybody can do to help. Yes, its frustrating. <comment213661> @IconDaemon I have these issues with various applications, Chrome, Outlook, Safari, and others. I thought if there was a button for "drive a stake through the heart of keychain" I would like to know where it is. <comment213719> Unfortunately, the Keychain is an integral part of OS X security and can't just be turned off. What are the specific requests that need to be fulfilled? Details matter! <comment305296> Did not work for me.  It creates a new hex name folder on reboot, but still continues to generate the obnoxious popups that refuse to accept my password.  :-(
