Any way to get the displays menu in the menubar? <body> Running OS X El Capitan (late 2013 iMac). Unfortunately it looks like the "show displays in menu bar" option was removed from System Preferences. Is it possible to get the menu back?  PS - opening the Displays.menu file (/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Volume.menu) adds the menu back, but as soon as I click on it, it disappears.  sAlso, if it's of any relevance, I've got HiDPI mode enabled (but not active)./s 99% sure it doesn't matter, disabling HiDPI mode didn't affect the issue.  <answer251649> You could use a third-party utility named Display Menu. It's available in the App Store for free. I've been using it for quite a while and it has work just fine.  By the way, when I open code/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Displays.menu/code it puts the same menu as the strong[] Show mirroring options in the menu bar when available/strong check box in System Preferences  Displays  Display, does when checked, but does check the box.
