How to use latest Safari.app version in older Mavericks <body> I have Safari.app taken from newer mac. But the older safari on my mavericks is outdated and youtube does not support older safari version. So I wanted a workaround to use updated safari on my mavericks.  <comment344076> Are you not getting [updates](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) for your Mac running Mavericks? <comment344179> @Allan I have got the best update available for safari on the App Store for Mavericks 10.9.5.
