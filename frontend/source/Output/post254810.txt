What is the 'deleted' daemon in macOS Sierra? <body> Since installing macOS 10.12 I noticed a flood of messages from codedeleted/code in the logs. I haven't been able to find any information about this daemon. Could anyone enlighten me what this does?  <answer255802> For me, this problem was being caused by problems with iStat Menus on macOS Sierra 10.12.0. There seems to be a bug which causes issues with the deleted process. Once I uninstalled iStat Menus the problem ceased. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3pnH1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer255833> codedeleted/code is the process for CacheDelete, which is used to purge caches on disk. Looking in code/System/Library/CacheDelete//code you can see what services are registered as a client.  <comment318876> Agree iStatMenus is the cause.  It is sufficient to turn off the Disks section.  Reported this as a fault some weeks ago, but no sign of a fix. <comment319721> Just a heads up, this issue was fixed in the beta release of 10.12.1 (16B2338c). `deleted` still shows up every now and then, but it doesn't consume as much as a core anymore (from 25% to around 0.4% for me). <comment324808> This is still a problem on 10.12.1, and turning off the disks section didn't help in my case, in fact turning off all sections didn't help, I had to uninstall. I hope it gets fixed soon, I love iStat Menus, I don't know why they didn't build something similar into macOS. <comment324814> Well this is very odd. They've updated their build of 5.20 without actually changing the version number. You can't update to it directly, you have to uninstall and then redownload from their website. Anyway, seems to fix the deleted logging problem (though oddly the 5.30 beta didn't).
