Proper command to convert m3u8 to mp4 <body> I found these various commands and am confused why they're so different from each other:  ul lim3u8 stream to mp4 using ffmpeg - GitHub Gist  precodeffmpeg -i "http://url/in.m3u8" -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -vcodec copy -c copy -crf 50 out.mp4 /code/pre/li liConverting an HLS (m3u8) to MP4 - Stack Overflow  precodeffmpeg -i http://url/in.m3u8 -acodec copy -vcodec copy out.mp4 ffmpeg -i http://url/in.m3u8 -acodec copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -vcodec copy out.mp4 /code/pre/li liFFMPEG mp4 from http live streaming m3u8 file? - Stack Overflow  precodeffmpeg -i http://url/in.m3u8 -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc out.mp4 ffmpeg -i http://url/in.m3u8 -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -t &lt;time&gt; out.mp4 /code/pre/li liDownload or convert M3U8 stream to MP4 - FFmpeg Support Forum  precodeffmpeg -i "http://url/in.m3u8" -c:v copy -c:a copy -f mp4  C:\LOCATION-NAME /code/pre/li liHow do I download the following m3u8 url? - VideoHelp Forum  precodeffmpeg -i "http://url/in.m3u8" -c copy out.mkv ffmpeg -i "http://url/in.m3u8" -c copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc out.mkv /code/pre/li /ul    ol listrongWhat are the proper bits to put in this command and in what order?/strong/li listrongDoes the URL need to be in quotes?/strong/li listrongWhere in my system will it save this "out.mp4"?/strong/li /ol  In case anybody wants to know, I'm trying to extract the main video on this page:BR http://abc13.com/science/meet-female-scientists-thriving-in-male-dominated-field/2040879  In the code for that page I found this m3u8 url:BR http://content.uplynk.com/ext/1efe3bfc4d1e4b5db5e5085a535b510b/052617-ewn-4pm-women-in-science-vid_web.m3u8  I went ahead and tried one of the above, just to see what would happen. It did give me an mp4 of the video, but the audio/video was out of sync pretty badly. Here's the command I used:  precodeffmpeg -i http://content.uplynk.com/ext/1efe3bfc4d1e4b5db5e5085a535b510b/052617-ewn-4pm-women-in-science-vid_web.m3u8 -acodec copy -bsf:a aac_adtstoasc -vcodec copy out.mp4 /code/pre  BR  5. strongso, in addition to the 4 questions above, is there a way to get the a/v to stay in sync?/strong  <comment360278> Reading the manual would be a good starting point. <comment360281> well, have you seen that manual?! holy cow it's long & confusing. i'm a lay-person, not a programmer; just trying to get a news video of my sister. am hoping a kind soul will help with this single task that is not in my field of expertise. and yes, i did try to read the manual & was just too lost. <comment360282> OK, you get a +1 for effort. I don't have ffmpeg installed on this machine, will try later to find one that does. <comment360284> In response to your edit summary: I'm not a moderator, I edit to improve the readability of posts, and in this case I edited your post to make the URLs actual links, formatted the links tighter together, removed the copious use of bold and removed the HTML markup. Please don't use HTML markup; you can use Markdown's two spaces at the end of the line for a line break. If you ‘hate’ your posts being edited, [this probably isn't the site for you](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing). Feel free to discuss this further in [chat] (where I would have said this but you are not pingable). <comment360329> @grgarside - OFF TOPIC, but to respond about post editing... i used bold only on the actual questions to help them stand out; i'm not allowed to make links in posts yet (some sort of point system i don't have enough of yet), so i just remove the http's; i used html because i hate markup (there's too many varieties to keep them all remembered; every app i have that uses it does it differently). what's "readable" to one person may be different to another. this site is for me due to its amazing helps but post editing has gone overboard (imo). ✌
