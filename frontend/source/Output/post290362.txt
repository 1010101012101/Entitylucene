Xcode - No include suggestions in header files <body> The autocomplete for including works most of the time in c++ source files(.cpp). It looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6vnTn.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, if I try to do the same in a c++ header file(.hpp), it doesn't work: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iyWMD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there anyway that I can enable include suggestions in header files too?  <comment366534> Welcome to Ask Different. Could you perhaps edit what “including suggestions” means. Is it spotlight indexing of other files or perhaps link to a WWDC video or documentation explaining the function? It’s not clear if you just want syntax expansion for the language or expansion of functions and variables that might be in your project already.
