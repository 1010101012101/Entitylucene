Find the target of an alias or link in Quicksilver <body> Can I find the target of an alias or symbolic link using Quicksilver? I don't find a way to do so on this Quicksilver reference which is the best source I know of at this point.  <answer116935> I wasn’t aware of a way, but with some trial and error, I found that hitting code→/code or code//code will take you to the original item for symbolic links. It doesn’t seem to work for aliases. There should probably be a “Show Original” action.  <comment136720> Thanks. But unfortunately this isn't working for me for either links or aliases. <comment136953> Which version are you running? I tested with the latest release (1.1.3) and with my custom build. <comment137044> Oops--my mistake. When I tested I selected a symlink and then used Cmd-Esc to get into Quicksilver. It turns out that doing that already dereferences the symbolic link; I got the original file in Quicksilver to begin with. So when I pressed / or → nothing happened, and all I was looking for was something to change. FWIW I'm also using the latest release (1.1.3).
