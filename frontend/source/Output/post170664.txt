Can't send text to only 1 contact on iPhone 4S <body> Can call friend and he can call and text me, but I can't text him. I get the following message on my iphone 4S:+1(1)(216)116-11 8061092 Error Invalid Number. Please re-send using a valid 10 digit mobile number or valid short code. This is the only contact that I have this problem with. Any ideas?  <comment200701> do all of your contacts have that many numbers? That's like 17. <comment200702> country code 1 & 1... 2 area codesâ€¦ I'd check the number's actually right & try again. Numbers are +[cc] then 10/11 digits [depending on leading zero if no country code] <comment200714> Are the numbers which don't have problems formatted the same way and also in the US? At least the +1(1) part at the beginning looks kind of strange to me. <comment200746> Very odd. Check your contact entry for your friend and try re-entering his number, e.g., +15555551212. iOS should reformat it accordingly as +1 (555) 555-1212.
