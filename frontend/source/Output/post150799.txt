How to force Finder to update file thumbnails? <body> Recently I updated album covers in most of my mp3s, but their respective thumbnails on Finder did not get updated.  Things I tried:  ul liRemoved (rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist) without solving the issue at all/li li"touch"(ed) the files, which refreshed some - not all - the thumbnails/li /ul  Any ideas on how to force a refresh of my mp3 thumbnail icons in Finder?  See the manifestation of this issue below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mak7q.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer150802> Thumbnails are generated by emQuickLook/em. You can reset its cache by typing codeqlmanage -r cache/code.  If this didn't work reset it completly with codeqlmanage -r/code.  <answer152983> I found this thread on the Apple forum where one guy said he had the same problem as you with Finder not showing the cover art on MP3 icons.  He said he fixed the problem by going into iTunes and deleting all his Voice Memos (apparently you have to delete them from both the Playlist and Genre sections in iTunes) and then restarting iTunes.  A bunch of people replied to him saying that solved the problem for them as well.  If you need your voice memos then back them up to a different location before you delete them from iTunes.  <comment177450> Thumbnails are generated by *QuickLook*.

I'm not sure if it helps, that's why I posted a comment. <comment177453> Nice. Although the question is form the OP, your post can help others as well. It might not be the right answer to this problem for the OP, it is an answer to the problem. <comment177565> Unfortunately it didn't force the thumbnails to update. Any other ideas? <comment179328> Do these .mp3 files have cover art? If not, no thumb will be created, ever. iTunes might put these in the 'same' album and only use the coverart of the first song. Are your really sure there is cover-art? <comment180142> Try this: right click - *Show View Options* - uncheck and check again *Show icon preview*. Does it work? <comment180150> the .mp3s do have cover arts, I can see all cover arts inside iTunes. <comment180208> @Pomario, where do you see the cover art? Usually iTunes 'borrows' the cover art from the first song of the same album. So if you see cover arts in iTunes does not mean the art is within the ID3 tag of the audiofile. <comment359507> This is the kind of random I-heard-somebody-say answer that is more typical of those very Apple forums that bring me to StackExchange. If you haven't tested a solution or have it on very good authority, please don't pass on random rumors.
