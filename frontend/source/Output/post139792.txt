Incomplete List of Print Drivers <body> I'm trying to install some drivers (Brother MFC9465CDN) that come pre-installed with OS X Mavericks (and lower) on another computer.  Trouble is, when I type the IP of the printer on this second MacBook, it doesn't auto-detect the right software/drivers.  Unfortunately, the manufacturers site is having issues when I tried to download them a few hours ago, but more importantly I'm looking for a fix as oppose to a work around on this.  I've reset the printer system already - twice now in fact, complete all software updates and done the usual restart etc.  For reference sake, this has worked on multiple other Macs and the drivers are listed in this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3669  Any other suggestions?  Thanks in advance.  <comment164744> What is your problem getting the driver from Brother site http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=mfc9465cdn_eu_as&os=132 I just tried and it downloads the drivers for OS 10.9 <comment164839> @Buscar웃, that page works.  On the product page, hitting download would loop back to the product page.  Even then, as mentioned, this is a work around.  I'm looking for a fix as these drivers come standard with OS X.  Thanks though. <comment164844> If you want the apple supplied drivers, they are a part of the Mavericks Installer, and you will have to extract them from there. <comment164881> @Buscar웃, I see.  Would I be right to assume that a reinstall of Mavericks is probably needed to get all such drivers without painfully selecting them on an individual basis?
