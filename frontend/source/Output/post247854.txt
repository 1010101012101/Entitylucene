Why is my Safari download of Xcode over running? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SUWjV.png" alt="enter image description here"  The picture says it all ("6.06 of 4.43"!?!). Never seen anything like it! Shall I leave it, or re download? What is the size meant to be of Xcode 8 Beta 3?  <comment305842> You didn't mention it but i'm assuming you're downloading this from the actual Apple Developer site and not a 3rd-part site.  If it's been running a long time, more than normal for Xcode downloads, I'd kill it, delete the file and try again. I've seen the Apple servers mess-up downloads of Xcode before.  Killing it and restarting has helped me with issues in the past. <comment305847> This question actually made me laugh. Reminds me of those cheesy cartoons I used to watch when I was younger. I'm more questioning why it is in a XIP file rather than a ZIP. <comment305851> The file format indeed looks rather unusual for Apple
