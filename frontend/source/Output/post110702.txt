How to know which program has just played sound? <body> At times, my computer suddenly played some annoying short sound (sounds like emdarrrt/em, seems not from the system), and it's so short that I have no idea where it comes from (and cannot capture it).  Is there any ways to find which program/process did that? (I really want to kill it!)  supI am using OS X Mavericks./sup  <answer111797> Sounds like the iMessage logged in notification.  Try this command in terminal to verify:  precodeafplay "/Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/Logged In.aiff" /code/pre  To turn if off you can turn off "Play sound effects" in the iMessage preferences.  <answer111822> SoundBunny might be able to help with this. The primary purpose of the app is to let you control various apps' sound levels, but it also usually shows you what apps have emrecently/em made sounds, which might help.  You can download a free demo from their website and leave it running until you hear the noise again, then switch over to SoundBunny and see what it shows.  <answer137243> Thanks for all answers! The problem was solved, it was turned out to be caused by a Safari plug-in( notifier of Gmail ). Method: inspiration(sorry guys I just found it out by realizing I installed a weird plugin... really hard to explain how the idea came to my mind...).  <comment130371> Short buzzer sound is used by the calendar notifications in most cases. Observe whether a reminder appears on top right of the screen or in the notification center. <comment130372> [`dtrace`](http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2011/10/10/top-10-dtrace-scripts-for-mac-os-x/) might be able to probe the information. A quick look over the in built scripts doesn't seem to provide anything to probe specific devices though so probably needs a custom script <comment132424> Thanks for coming back with an answer, but can you please add it as an answer below (and accept it) instead of modifying the question? <comment163055> @patrix Thanks for your comment. I just followed your advice. <comment163102> It would probably help others if you explained how you figured out the cause (i.e., what method you used to identify which app was responsible).  That might help others in the same situation, even if they don't have the same Safari plug-in. <comment294477> How does it show what apps have recently made sounds? From what I can tell it just shows an alphabetical list of the apps that are open. And the log doesn't show when sounds are played, just when apps start/end.
