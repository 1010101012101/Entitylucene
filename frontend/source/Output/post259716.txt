Is there a way to prevent the File Sharing feature in iTunes? <body> The company that I work for currently has restrictions in place to prevent users from copying data to a flash drive.  Now, they are looking to install iTunes on firm workstations to allow users to sync their media library, backup photos and videos, and back up their entire iOS devices locally.  The security issue is that iTunes has the ability to drag documents into apps' sandboxes in its Apps  File Sharing section.  Can this be disabled in a group or app policy without affecting the rest of iTunes' capability?
