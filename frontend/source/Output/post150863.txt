Terminal flashes on empty backspace with Yosemite <body> Since using Yosemite, I've had the annoying problem of my current Terminal window flashing when backspacing on an empty line. I know on previous versions of OS X this flashing was not default, and could be toggled in accessibility settings, but I cannot find the same setting and I'm dying to get this turned off. Any known ways to get rid of it?  <answer150869> That is called the visual bell, and by default itâ€™s enabled when your sound is muted. To change that setting, go into Terminal  Preferences  Profiles  &lt;emyour profile/em  Advanced.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I2L46.png" alt="screenshot of prefpane"  You can also run  precodeecho $'\nset bell-style off' &gt;&gt; ~/.inputrc /code/pre  to disable Readline's use of the bell (deleting on an empty line, tab-complete, etc.). You will need to restart your session for this change to take effect.  <comment186711> good job bro!!!
