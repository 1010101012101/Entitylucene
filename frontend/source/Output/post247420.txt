Is it mandatory to upload screenshots for all screensizes when submitting to the app Store? <body> I am preparing a new application, and iOS requires screenshots of the application. They ask for screenshots in the following sizes:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zb7KE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is it necessary to upload screenshots for all resolutions?  What will be the ramifications if I only upload screenshots for 5.5-Inch and iPad?  <answer247470> From what I understand if you emonly/em upload 5.5inch and iPad, they'll just reject you outright. Currently, it looks like they require at least 4 and 3.5. If you indicate it's optimized for iPhone 6, it also requires a 4.7.  It looks like if it indicates that it runs on iPad you need both an iPad an iPad Pro.   Check out the requirements for yourself here: iTunes Connect Dev Guide  Remember, required/requirements means it's strongmandatory/strong.  <answer287559> Now you only need to upload a 5.5-inch screenshot  <comment363134> This is an answer, @Peter  . It says you only have to upload one size. It might be a right answer or a wrong answer - people should vote and comment and possibly edit to explain or source the answer with documentation.
