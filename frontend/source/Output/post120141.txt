Using NTFS External drive <body> I'm new to MAC OS.   Using MacOSX 10.9.1 (Mavericks).   My external HDD is formatted with NTFS.   I need some rock-solid, free solution for reading and writing to this HDD. Any suggestions?   <answer120142> Use ntfs-3g:  ol liInstall Homebrew/li liInstall fuxe4x and ntfs-3g  precodebrew install fuse4x &amp;&amp; brew install ntfs-3g /code/pre/li liReplace (with backup) the codemount_ntfs/code:  precodesudo mv /sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs.orig sudo ln -s /usr/local/sbin/mount_ntfs /sbin/mount_ntfs /code/pre/li liGet info on fuxe4x-kext  precodebrew info fuse4x-kext /code/pre/li liYou should be given two lines based on your version that you need to run. Run these lines in Terminal./li liEject and remount the disk./li /ol  <answer120146> It's not free but I have had great success w/ this product: http://www.paragon-software.com/home/ntfs-mac/  <answer120159> If you have a seagate device, then Paragon for Seagate is free and reliable.  <answer164497> I am using the free 'Fuse for OSX' with 'NTFS-3G'. This Page describes the Installation.   I have used it for a couple of years (since 10.5 through 10.10) without any major Problems and can recommend both.  <answer181262> http://sourceforge.net/projects/native-ntfs-osx/files/  Native solution. No 3rd party drivers or software installs.  <comment140143> is that reliable solution? <comment140147> @Tural Not entirely sure what you mean, but yes this works fine, although Mavericks complicated the install process a bit. <comment140151> http://joxi.ru/3RX0UhjKTJDoXJWgM1k getting this error <comment140181> not working on mavericks
