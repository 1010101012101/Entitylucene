Specific DNS search domain queries sent to different server <body> I'm running OSX 10.9.5. I plan on upgrading at some point, so please let me know if that will impact an answer.  I have some work-specific hosts that I need to resolve (dev1.internal.example.com, dev2, test1, etc.) that are configured on an internal DNS server on the work network (172.22.22.0/24).  I am often connected to the work network via VPN (Tunnelblick). By default, when I VPN in, my DNS is set to 172.22.22.1 and all DNS gets sent through the VPN. In addition, my DNS search domain gets set to internal.example.com, so that I don't have to type out dev1.internal.example.com.  Otherwise, my DNS uses DHCP-provided settings.  The issue that I'm trying to solve is that I'm often tethering my laptop while on the train, and since that makes my connection unreliable, my VPN connection breaks. It's difficult to tell, but the impression I have is that general internet access is restored eventually, but the VPN takes longer to time out and reconnect. During that time, DNS isn't available, which essentially prolongs the outage for most uses.  My thought is to make it so that I have a search domain of internal.example.com set to route DNS queries to 172.22.22.1, and everything else use the DHCP DNS server. However, I can't seem to create an /etc/resolver/ entry that actually accomplishes that. Best I've been able to do so far is:  precode&gt; scutil --dns resolver #1   nameserver[0] : 192.168.43.1   if_index : 5 (en1)   flags    : Request A records   reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address  resolver #2   domain   : local   options  : mdns   timeout  : 5   flags    : Request A records   order    : 300000 ...  resolver #8   domain   : internal.example.com   search domain[0] : internal.example.com   nameserver[0] : 172.22.22.1   flags    : Request A records   reach    : Reachable  DNS configuration (for scoped queries)  resolver #1   nameserver[0] : 192.168.43.1   if_index : 5 (en1)   flags    : Scoped, Request A records   reach    : Reachable,Directly Reachable Address /code/pre  How can I accomplish sending general DNS queries to the DHCP DNS server, while the internal names get sent to 172.22.22.1?
