Is it possible to know the last time my iphone was online? <body> My iphone was stolen about two months ago and the company wants to know the date which I lost it. Is it possible to recover information to the last time it was turned on?   <answer134706> Yeah, go to iCloud Find, select your device &amp; voila... You also see where it is right now, lock and erease it. Whats required is that you have to have iCloud set up before it got stolen ^^.  <comment159292> your phone company can tell you that.
