XAMPP on Mavericks install APC and Memcached <body> What I already did:  ul liDownload latest stable release from pecl.php.net with wget- /li liUnpack archive/li liRun phpize, ./configure, make, make install, etc../li /ul  That stuff went well, now I have:  precode/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/apc.so /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/memcached.so /code/pre  In my php.ini (Loaded Configuration File from phpinfo) I added:  precodeextension_dir="/usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20100525/" extension=memcached.so extension=apc.so /code/pre  But the problem is, the libraries are not beeing loaded, the correspondent sections in phpinfo() are missing. I have tried to:  ul liRestart apache/li liComment out "extension_dir"/li liUse "zend_extension" instead of "extension"/li liSpecify the full path to the .so files/li /ul  Restart of XAMPP happens without problems, no error log is generated. Anyone of you have an idea what could be wrong here?  <answer139528> If you've installed XAMPP then you'll have two versions of PHP on your system. I think the problem is that you are using the XAMPP version of PHP, but the extensions have been compiled against the OS bundled version.  If you are using XAMPP then you'll need to use the toolchain that comes with XAMPP. For example, try codesudo /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/pecl install memcached/code, this seems to download, build and install memcached correctly for me so that XAMPP can use it.  After that I just needed to add the codeextension=memcached.so/code line to php.ini and now memcached is appearing in phpinfo().  <comment164476> Seems like i found the issue, but how can i force PECL to use the correct API version?  `PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: memcached: Unable to initialize module Module compiled with module API=20100525 PHP    compiled with module API=20121212 These options need to match  in Unknown on line 0  PHP Warning:  PHP Startup: apc: Unable to initialize module Module compiled with module API=20100525 PHP    compiled with module API=20121212 These options need to match  in Unknown on line 0` <comment164509> Your solution did not work for me (same result as before), but finally the way to do it was very close:    `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/phpize ./configure --with-php-config=/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/bin/php-config-5.5.9`
