How to create a pseudo-guest account in Lion with FileVault 2? <body> The guest account always had very limited permissions, unfortunately since activating FileVault on Lion it's deactivated by default. (More about it here: Unable to create Guest Account after enabling FileVault.)  Is it possible to give the guest account a password? Or can I create a regular account with the normal guest account's privileges (hence making a pseudo-guest account)?  I simply need FileVault and a limited account for my guest! :)  <answer20059> h1Guest Account/h1  This account is visible in Directory Utility, but please do not attempt to make it compatible with FileVault 2. Not only for security; there may be other good reasons for Apple making this account not available whilst FileVault 2 is enabled.   h1Other accounts/h1  For your guest you might like to create a standard account, or add parental controls. You can probably have an account that is password-free. This is in line with Kyle Cronin's answer to a linked question.   h2Recommended reading/h2  Apart from being able to encypt an entire volume, what are the other differences of FileVault 2 over FileVault?  <answer20988> If you download the OS X server tools package, you can use the Users and Groups application to modify user's rights, even on OS X Client.  There are quite a few options to lock it down in various ways, depends on your exact requirements for locking it down.  So, I would just create a regular account and configure it to run the way you'd like.  <comment33564> You can now create Guest logins in Lion -  http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/29206 <comment39875> actually, no, you can NOT create password-free accounts of any type (admin, standard, or Parental Controlled) once FileVault is enabled. If you could, the guest account wouldn't be disabled.
