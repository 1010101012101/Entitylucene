iOS WLAN dysfunction: Spontaneous disconnection <body> I have a problem with iOS 10.3.x where the WLAN connection is dropped spontaneously while in use; it automatically reconnects when the settings app is open and in focus.  Sometimes (but not often) it is fairly persistent, and disconnects again straight away, so I have to manually drop the connection and re-associate.  Does anyone else experience this problem, know why it happens, or have a solution? Cheers.
