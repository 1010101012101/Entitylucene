Mail.app in Mavericks moves Gmail mails to Trash instead of Archiving them <body> In OS X before Mavericks, Mail.app with a Gmail account would remove messages only from the inbox when deleting them,  but leave them in the emAll Mail/em folder; essentially archiving them. In Mavericks it now moves them to the Trash entirely. What gives?  <answer108114> Mavericks Mail.app is now actually aware of the emAll Mail/em folder and has "archiving" as a separate concept, just like iOS does. The old emdelete-from-inbox-to-archive/em was arguably a hack in Gmail's IMAP implementation which now no longer works. Now "Delete" actually means emdelete/em and "Archive" means emarchive/em.  The new command is in the menu under emMessage  Archive/em, its keyboard shortcut is kbd⌃⌘A/kbd. You can add the Archive button to the toolbar via emView  Customise Toolbar.../em if it's not there.  Apparently you will also have to show the emAll Mail/em folder to IMAP clients, which is something you have to configure in your settings on the Gmail website. I have not confirmed this though, I always had it on anyway.  <answer113030> For returning to the pre 10.9 behavior, see http://steve.blogs.loeppky.com/2013/12/mavericks-apple-mail-with-gmail-getting.html .  For archiving with the delete key, see http://akgungor.com/2013/11/11/delete2archive-archive-gmail-messages-using-delete-key-os-x-mavericks-mail/  <answer113330> I created a simple Mail.app plugin that you can install to restore the pre-Maverick archiving behaviour.

I did not know this.  Apparently I've permanently deleted all my mails from the 2 months.  I must figure out how to remap the delete key to "archive". <comment151665> I do approve of the change. Delete should mean Delete, and Archive should mean Archive. However the implementation of Archive is still wrong. Mail simply creates another Gmail label, Archive, and labels messages with it. They remain in the Inbox on Gmail. Simply removing the Inbox label would be the correct approach. Anyone know how to make it work properly? <comment151685> @Kurt FWIW, it works correctly for me, and not as you describe it. <comment274826> Can I configure Mail so that sliding to the left in the list of mails results in Archive instead of Delete for my Gmail account? <comment291567> I created a rule to delete certain messages. In actuality it is archiving them.
