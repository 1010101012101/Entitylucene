Left Command + Z isn't working anymore <body> I have a full size Apple keyboard attached to my MacBook Pro. The left kbd⌘/kbd + kbdZ/kbd key combination isn't working since a while.  ol liThe problem only occurs when using the left Command key. kbd⌘/kbd + kbdZ/kbd is working fine./li liThe left Command key works fine with other combinations, such as left kbd⌘/kbd + kbdX/kbd./li liThe problem only occurs when using the external keyboard. Left kbd⌘/kbd + kbdZ/kbd is working fine on the MacBook itself./li /ol  I tried restoring the keyboard settings to its defaults, to no avail. This could be a hardware problem, but I can't understand why the left Command key works fine in combination with other keys.  I'm clearly lost here. Any ideas?  Edit: Tested the keyboard on another MacBook and it's having the same issues. So, it's most likely a hardware issue. Can this be fixed?  <answer155720> Fixed it! Cleaned the area underneath the Z key and everything is working again. :-)
