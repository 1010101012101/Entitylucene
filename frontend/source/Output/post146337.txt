Can I mount an external NTFS drive as writable when running the install DVD? <body> I have an old Macbook Pro on which I'd like to try Mavericks. Before doing so I want to make a back-up of my current Mac OS X install (10.6.8).  I will use the disk utility option (and not the time machine option), as outlined here, since I already have a 1TB NTFS disk, that I use for other back-ups as well. However, NTFS is mounted read-only, by default. Since I don't feel like creating a FAT partition on this disk, nor feel like purchasing another HDD (because 1TB is more than enough for my back-up needs) I want to mount the disk writable.  Now, I know I should be able to mount NTFS drives by tinkering with code/etc/fstab/code. However, I assume that code/etc/fstab/code will not be read when booting from the install disk. Is that correct?  If so, my question is: can I mount an external NTFS drive as writable when running the install DVD?  <answer146345> I figured it out:  I opened a terminal window and executed codemount_ntfs/code similar to this:  precodemount_ntfs -s -o rw /dev/diskXsY /Volumes/SomeMountDirectory /code/pre  where:  ol licode-o rw/code is the crucial part and means use the readwrite option;/li licode-s/code means mount case sensitive;/li licode/dev/diskXsY/code represents the actual partition to mount (in my case code/dev/disk8s5/code);/li licode/Volumes/SomeMountDirectory/code represents the mount point./li /ol  <comment172466> This may let you copy files to NTFS (with loss of some info e.g. file owner etc) BUT it won't let you restore OSX <comment172467> I've created a complete `.dmg` disk copy of `Macintosh HD` on that NTFS disk. That should be sufficient to completely restore from, shouldn't it?
