Problem installing Devel::REPL using cpanm <body> I tried following the instructions for installing CPAN modules at this link:  http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html  However, when I try to install Devel::REPL, it fails.  Here is the log:  precode[user@machine] cpanm Devel::REPL --&gt; Working on Devel::REPL Fetching http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/E/ET/ETHER/Devel-REPL-1.003025.tar.gz ...

Use perlbrew to install and manage a specific version of perl. This isolates your perl from OS X updates and changes which have caused multiple problems in the past:  precodecurl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash perlbrew install perl-5.16.0 perlbrew switch perl-5.16.0 /code/pre  h2cpan minus/h2  On your isolated copy, install cpan minus to reduce the memory cost of installing modules:  precodecurl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus /code/pre  h2Re-install Devel::REPL/h2  With this done, try re-installing codeDevel::REPL/code using cpanm:  precodecpanm Devel::REPL /code/pre  ...or cpan:  precodeperl -MCPAN -e 'install Devel::REPL' /code/pre  You should find modules install with less problems and are no longer affected by system updates or changes in Apple's decisions towards perl on OS X.  <comment157799> Could you edit in the question what version of OS X you run? <comment157802> +1 to installing your own, local copy of Perl. This, in the long run, is much saner than doing `sudo cpanm ...` as you'll control when and if Perl changes on your machine, not Apple's OS updates. If you're already using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) you can install a local perl via it as well.
