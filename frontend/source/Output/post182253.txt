Extract specific app data from an older iCloud Backup <body> My problem is this:  About a year ago I installed an application that did a very simple task. Just counting days from a specific date.  Long story short, after a bunch of iOS updates, this app started to crash and was soon discontinued by the developer, who apparently could not be asked to updated the app.  Now the specific date is very dear to me, but I have long since forgotten it.  I am convinced that this date can be extracted, if I can get access to the app data of some old iCloud backup. I suspect that the specific backup is not that important, as long as it is between the time I entered the date, and the time the app was discontinued, which is over a year.  I have tried googling around, but I cannot find any information on how to extract app data from a backup. I would suspect it is a SQLite database or even just a hidden file in the iPhone home folder that I would need access to.  Any ideas?
