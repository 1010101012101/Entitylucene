How to keep Night Shiftâ„¢ enabled indefinitely on macOS 10.12.5+? Settings only have "turn on until tomorrow" <body> I want to keep it turned on until I turn it off, not until some fixed date. How to achieve this?  (I know about the option to use f.lux, but I'd prefer to not depend on it now that macOS is so close to being able to do it itself)  <answer285040> In the preferences (System Preferences  Display  Night Shift) do the following:  ul liset 'Schedule' to Custom/li liset 'From:' to 00:00/li liset 'to:' to 23:59/li liadjust the Color Temperature as desired/li /ul  Now night shift will be enabled all the time. Disable it using the Notification Center or using the 'Manual' toggle in the preferences pane.  <comment359443> doesn't work. apparently it decides that the "night" part is the 1-minute interval. <comment359445> In this case please try it with two other times like 'from 10:00 to 09:59'. This will activate it for 24:00 hours. The larger time value (10:00) should be in the left. Otherwise it will be activated for just two minutes. :) <comment359452> hmm, maybe it doesn't apply the schedule setting immediately and I have to wait 1-2 days
