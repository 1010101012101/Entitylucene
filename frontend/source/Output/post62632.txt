What software extends quicktime to support codecs as an alternative to Perian? <body> Now that Perian is closing its doors (and thus ending support), I'd like to know if there are any alternatives to Perian - specifically alternatives that add Quicktime support for more filetypes (and thus all the benefits with Apples Video editing/burning applications)  Of the alternatives that Perian themselves have suggested, none have Perians integration with Quicktime:  Niceplayer - standalone application that relies on Perian(!)  VLC - standalone application that doesn't integrate with Quicktime  MPlayer - standalone CLI program that doesn't integrate with Quicktime  So, are there any other QuickTime-integrated codec applications out there?

I miss Perian, too, but have made the switch to Zongyao Qu’s MPlayerX, which is current, useful and pretty (strongemnot/em/strong the Sourceforge flavor!) …
