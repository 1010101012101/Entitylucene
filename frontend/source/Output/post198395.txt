How do I see the queue of untagged faces in the new Mac Photos App? <body> In the old iPhoto, I could go to a screen to see a queue of faces that hadn't been tagged, with tag suggestions.

My question is: strongHow do I see the queue of untagged faces in the new Mac Photos App?/strong  <answer198407> Albums  Faces - the pending list should appear at the bottom of the page, if there are any new faces to tag.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDBv9.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3yWuC.png" alt="enter image description here"
