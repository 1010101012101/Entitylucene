Early 2013 Macbook Pro with 4K <body> From what I'm reading online it sounds like 4K displays like Seiki displays will work correctly with a late 2013 MBP or later. I have an early 2013 MBP and am not finding much of any evidence that a 4K display will work with this model. Will a 4K display work at 3840x2160 with at least 30 Hz on a early 2013 MBP? Does anyone have this or a similar setup that could provide feedback or any issues that have? I'm interested in an external display with a high resolution and 4K seems like the best option.  <answer130019> No. According to this Apple Support article, 4K Display is not supported. The highest resolution your machine can support on an external monitor is 2560x1600.   <answer154924> I have early 2013 15" retina mbp and I can drive seiki 39 4K TV via HDMI (using supplied cable) just fine.  <answer167021> Yes, it is possible to drive a 4k Display with an early 2013 and even 2012 Retina Macbook.  h11.

It doesn't happen often enough for it to be a big issue, but it can be annoying.  Most of the time i run at 2560 x 1440, but i can go up to 3840 x 2160, both at 30HZ.  Both of these require a good quality HDMI cable v1.3.  The monitors i have used are Samsung U28D590D and Asus PB287Q.  The Asus gives a richer picture, but the Samsung is brighter.  <answer244962> Its possible with SwitchResX and this stuff. Mini DisplayPort 1.2 to HDMI 2.0a Active Adapter 4K@60Hz  I have a MBP, early 2013, and it's working with 60Hz + 4k.  There are many adapters out there, but be sure is 4k + 60hz active, otherwise will not work.  <comment197302> This does indeed work on the early 2013 over both HDMI and Thunderbolt, but the maximum refresh rate is 30/24hz <comment197303> Even though Apple states this, it is not true. I own an Early 2013 MBP and it does work (over both HDMI and Thunderbolt). Also see Juan Namon's answer <comment220375> Precisely, 4K @ 30Hz just looks horrible.  Decent 4K is at least 60Hz. <comment301931> Do you have a link for "screenresx"?  It's helpful if you include references and links to the products you are reccomending. <comment343420> It actually is possible! Check the other answers in this thread. <comment344360> @SkeletonBow this answer is 3 yrs old and was accurate then based on Apple support article + available hardware. To whomever downvoted my answer - the information was accurate then and still is now. Though it may be possible now, Apple still hasn't updated that article. the consequences of driving 4K from it (kernel panics, lagging frames, overall serious performance strain) outweigh any benefit of advising its users to do so. Possible and practical should not be conflated. I own this machine and have driven 4K on it, but it's frozen up nearly every time at any refresh rate  30Hz <comment365060> @PatrickMcMahon - nope, I disagree.  And I'm typing this on an early 2013 machine connected to a 4k monitor (specifically, an LG 27UD58-B 27" Ultra HD 4K Monitor).   No adjustments, just plugged it in with a HDMI-HDMI cable.  I'm not a gamer though, so it may be awful for that.  For text (as in writing code) and videos it's just fine.  The only thing I notice is that mouse movement isn't quite as smooth as it is on the native laptop display. <comment373229> He meant [SwitchResX](http://www.madrau.com/support/support/faq.html)
