Pages won't open after unexpected shut down <body> I have OS X Yosemite v. 10.10.5.  After an update about 6 weeks ago Pages started refusing to respond, then shutting down unexpectedly.  Today Pages will not open at all.  I get the error message that Pages has shut down, do I want to reopen or report but reopen doesn't work.  Any suggestions??  <answer231213> I'd try clearing the saved state files.  From Finder:    ul likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd  /li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd   kbd G  /kbd    /li liCopy/paste code~/Library/Saved Application State/code/li /ul  Find the folder com.apple.iWork.Pages.savedState and delete the strongemcontents/em/strong not the folder itself, as it's an alias.br That should give Pages a fresh start.  <comment282926> Still no luck, when you open pages it opens a series of documents (about 10) then crashes. <comment282929> Clearing the saved state should prevent that - what's in the saved state, amongst other things, is the current open file list. I've tested & it works here. Sure you got everything when you cleared it?
