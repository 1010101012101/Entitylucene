Select all and then delete! Done!  <comment121450> +1 GREAT answer - helped me delete the unwanted photos. But still not solved the problem, doing this directly in the iPhone without a computer... <comment121542> I found the solution on iOS 6 (and earlier probably, though I did not test). Go to Settings - General - Usage - Photos & Camera. Then swipe on the Camera Roll entry, a Delete button will appear. This does *not* work on iOS 7. <comment121546> I'm still searching for a solution on iOS 7, but I don't think there's one. Obviously the iOS 6 solution should work. Apple probably forgot to add in the “Photos & Camera” usage page the “Edit” button that can be found for instance in the “Music” usage page. <comment121556> Simple, i can't understand why apple don't add a feature what is implemented in any basic camera.... Thanx anyway for the partial solution - accepting... <comment122848> "My Computer" is a Windows thing.   On Sep 25, he wanted a solution directly on the iPhone, not using a computer. <comment135474> There is a way of doing this on iOS7 by selecting entire collections at a time and deleting them this way. See here: http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/iphoneandipodtouchapps/qt/Select-Photos-Ios7.htm <comment142003> At the moment I'm testing iOS 7.1 beta 5 and it's still not fixed if it's a bug as mentioned(it's highly unlikely but maybe because of some weird reason Apple wants it the it is right now). Perhaps I should inform Apple about it. <comment142041> You should inform Apple, but should not discuss this here; you're under NDA dude! ;) <comment174359> ImageCapture FTW! <comment311563> ImageCapture on OS X El Capitain and iPhone 6 connected shows a 'prohibited button' - but it is not red. I kinda missed it because I was looking for a 'red' button somewhere. :)
