Trying to connect to system via gateway with Microsoft Remote Desktop <body> I have a Mac running Mavericks, and I am using Microsoft Remote Desktop for the Mac version 8.0.24308.  There is one Windows machine I need to connect to via our network, but it sits behind a gateway machine.  I have tried logging in with the Mac Client with the gateway configured. It looks like it can find the system, but then I get the following error:     The gateway failed to connect with the message: 501 Method RPC_IN_DATA is not defined in RFC 2068 and is not supported by the Servlet API   I can connect if I first unplug my Ethernet network, log onto our empublic/em network, and then start up our VPN which is slow and a pain to do while I am at work. (From home, everything is fine). Or, via codessh -X gateway/code and running coderdesktop/code. Both are much slower (our WiFi network is not very fast) and the coderdesktop/code and X11 have a tendency to crash.
