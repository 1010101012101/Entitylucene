Sierra / El Capitan Sound stops working 1 / 5 sleeps (including bluetooth) - only cure is reboot <body> My Sound - first on El Capital - now on Sierra after upgrade - stops working about 1 / 5 times I put the Mac to sleep.  When this happens nothing makes a sound, volume controls done - and even if I connect to Bluetooth earphones they get no sound either.  When I click the volume icon is says internal speakers are selected. I can select other sources, none work - when I put it back still nothing works.  The only fix I have found is a reboot.  Has anyone encountered this? I am unable to reliably reproduce this - it's been happening for about 2 months - it was fine before that.  I am on a 2016 12" MacBook (512Gb).
