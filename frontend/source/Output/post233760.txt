Is Apple's Keychain integration with browsers safe? <body> I've avoided browser's saving my passwords for the past umpteen years because it wasn't safe.  I've instead used products like KeePass.  I don't like KeePass on OSX, and I'm not big on things like LastPass that keep passwords in the cloud on a server I don't control.  While looking for an OSX solution, I discovered that Safari uses Keychain to store the passwords and there is a firefox integration that does the same.  Is this a safe solution or am I better off looking towards some other encrypted store for browser passwords.  <comment285660> "Wasn't safe" is kind of vague. Was your worry someone sitting at the computer that isn't you? That malware could harvest the storage file? That you'd be compelled to hand over your user password and then someone could retrieve your various stored account credentials? That the encryption used was easily compromised? <comment285663> Wasn't safe in that browsers on other operating systems kept passwords in data stores that were easily hacked. <comment285685> Can you give more details about that as we ned to know what was the exact risk that you were worried about so we can say if it was fixed <comment285820> I'm not worried about a specific risk, I'm wondering if it's a generally safe solution to use.  As in, are people who are technically proficient comfortable with OSX with using the integration point to store their banking passwords.
