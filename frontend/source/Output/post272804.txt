Output JXA to stdout <body> I have a small script made with JXA (JavaScript for Automation) that outputs a result to the shell with codeconsole.log/code.  However, codeconsole.log/code seems to output to stderr and I’d like to output to stdout. I can always code2&gt;&amp;1/code when calling the script, but it would be preferable to output directly to stdout from the script.  Is there a way to accomplish that?  <answer275811> It may not be the prettiest solution ever, but I think your best bet is to use the Objective-C scripting bridge. The alternative would be to deal directly with the command line and codeprintf/code, which would probably be even messier.  Using the scripting bridge, you can re-assign codeconsole.log/code to a custom function that writes to codestdout/code using codeNSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardOutput/code. If you put this definition at the top of your program, you can then use this revised codeconsole.log/code.  precodeconsole.log = function() {     ObjC.import('Foundation');     for (argument of arguments) {         $.NSFileHandle.fileHandleWithStandardOutput.writeData($.NSString.alloc.initWithString(String(argument) + "\n").dataUsingEncoding($.NSNEXTSTEPStringEncoding));     } } /code/pre  Note that I've added a line break at the end of each string—you may want to customize this behavior to meet your needs.  <answer278395> Found the solution: don’t use codeconsole.log/code or anything else. Instead of  precodeconsole.log('something'); /code/pre  Simply  precode'something'; /code/pre  It will be output to stdout.  <comment342953> Close voters: This question on-topic since scripting is specifically listed as being on-topic on this site. <comment342971> How are you writing to console.log surely you are writing to stdout or stderr <comment343102> @Mark Just `console.log('whatever')`. Nothing out of the ordinary. <comment343104> Wgat does the documentation for console.log say? <comment343254> @Mark I never found any official good documentation on JXA. You can’t really deduce this one, though. I don’t have a problem building scripts, I’m asking for the specific function (or option) that’ll do what I need. <comment370084> Joined just to upvote this, thanks!
