How can I improve old blurry video clips using iMovie 11 or QuickTime? <body> I am trying to improve or get a better resolution from old somewhat blurred TV video clips that I have downloaded from tube.  These are usually 4-5 minute clips from the 1970's.  I do not have any source material tho.  If not able to clear up in iMovie is there another application or tool that can be used and which is best for this purpose?
