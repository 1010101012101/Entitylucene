Can I get Command-H to hide an Emacs window? <body> I'm using GNU Emacs 23.4.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin, NS apple-appkit-1038.36) of 2012-01-29 on bob.porkrind.org on a MacBook Air.  Can I set kbdCommand/kbd-kbdH/kbd to hide Emacs? I currently use M-x customize-group ns and set Command Modifier to no value. I already have a standard key binding to iconify-frame, but that is different from hiding; I'd rather use the native OS X hide capability so I can unhide by clicking on the Emacs icon in the dock.  <answer68309> I'm trying to solve the same problem. The best I've been able to come up with is the following, which will iconify (like CMD+M) the frame:  precode(global-set-key (kbd "M-h") 'iconify-frame) /code/pre  Not ideal, but better than nothing.  <answer69888> If emacs is built with Cocoa (e.g via codebrew install emacs --cocoa/code), by default codes-h/code (Cmd+h) should be bound to codens-do-hide-emacs/code  If somehow it is not, you can do this manually with:  precode(global-set-key [(super h)] 'ns-do-hide-emacs) /code/pre  <comment278596> If you have bound *Command* to *Meta* then the binding is: `(global-set-key [(meta h)] 'ns-do-hide-emacs)`
