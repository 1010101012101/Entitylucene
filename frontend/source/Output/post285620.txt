Safari gone from iPhone 6 Plus <body> My Safari app is missing from my iPhone. How do I get it back with all my bookmarks and history?  <answer285622> It seems like you've hidden or deleted it (I don't know for sure which it is for pre-installed apps).  Go to the App Store and search for Safari. You'll be able to "download" it back.  If the app has been deleted, in order to restore your data it depends on if you synchronized Safari bookmarks/history with iCloud.  strongEDIT/strong : apparently the native apps are simply emhidden/em.  <comment360245> When you swipe down to Search for it, does it show up? <comment360258> @fsb First party apps are not deleted from the device. It’s more accurate to say it’s hidden. Imo there’s nothing wrong with N. Cornet’s answer. <comment360261> @grgarside Thanks for clarifying; I've deleted my comments. <comment360263> According to what you said, I re-edited my answer (and deleted my comment too).
