Disk Utility is saying that I have twice as much storage as I do, causing partitioning problems <body> I am trying to partition my internal HDD so that I can install Windows 10. I tried using Boot Camp to do this (which is where I think the problem started) but it failed so I am trying to do it manually.  Now when I open Disk Utility it looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6iom.png" alt="Disk Utility - Device View"  When I then click partition the 'pie chart' adds up to 6TB, which is twice as much storage than I have:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X8eBF.png" alt="Disk Utility - Resize Partition"  When I try taking away the left hand partition and apply, it fails. If I add another partition, it duplicates that too.  When I look at storage in the 'About This Mac' tab it shows Macintosh HD twice, each HDD looks exactly the same.  Does anyone know why this might be happening?  Any help would be really appreciated.

The drive is partitioned to five slices:  ul lithe EFI partition at index 1 with a size of 209 MB/li lia Physical Volume at index 2 with a size of 2.2 TB/li lia Recovery HD partition at index 3 with a size of 650 MB/li lia Physical Volume at index 4 with a size of 801 GB/li lia Boot OS X partition at index 5 with a size of 134 MB/li /ul  Additionally the device contains a Logical Volume Group (CoreStorage). CoreStorage is a logical volume manager, which is an additional layer between device/partition and a volume.  A Logical Volume Group is based on one or several Physical Volumes (which can be one or several physical devices/partitions) and may contain one or several Logical Volume Families/Logical Volumes.  ul liOn one disk the common layout of a LVG is: LVG &lt; one PV (disk0s2)  one LVF  one LV (disk1)./li liOn two disks (e.g a Fusion Drive) the common layout of a LVG is:  LVG &lt; two PVs (disk0s2 &amp; disk1s2)  one LVF  one LV (disk2)./li /ul  Your actual disk (disk0) has a non-standard layout: LVG &lt; two PVs (disk0s2 &amp; disk0s4)  one LVF  one LV (disk1). This may happen after resizing the CoreStorage stack strongand/strong adding an additional partition in the then unallocated disk space, formatting it as HFS volume and adding it as a second Physical Volume to the already existing Logical Volume Group.  I can't really explain the origin of the Boot OS X volume (disk0s5).  hr  To salvage the mess, backup emMacintosh HD/em with Time Machine, boot to Internet Recovery Mode, repartition the internal drive to one (main) non-CoreStorage partition and restore the backup:  ul liBooted to your main volume attach your Time Machine backup drive. Go to the menubar and initiate another Time Machine backup cycle by choosing "Backup now..."./li liDetach the Time Machine drive after the backup is done/li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Yosemite or El Capitan)./li liOpen in the menubar Utilities/Terminal/li liEnter codediskutil cs list/code/li liYou will get an identical output as in your question/li lienter codediskutil cs delete lvgUUID/code (with lvgUUID: the UUID of your Logical Volume Group).

I did the first aid on disk utility. <comment318243> Haha, sorry, I've entered it into the original post now. Thank you. <comment318245> Did you try to create a 800 GB partition in Boot Camp for Windows 10? <comment318249> I tried to make it 500 GB. <comment318299> I'm trying to work out when all of this could have happened. The first time I've changed the internal HDD in any way was when I used Boot Camp yesterday. When the partition failed I used Boot Camp to restore it to one partition, then I tried to partition it through Disk Utility (where it was already showing two identical Macintosh 3 TB HDDs) which is where it must have split it up further in a weird way. I'm not too sure how to carry out your suggestion of booting to internet Recover Mode, also, I made a backup to time machine before I used Boot Camp, do you think this backup will suffice? <comment318301> No, I bought it new from apple. I did receive an email from apple to say the hard drive in my Mac needed replacing as could be a problem with it, but I missed the date to get this fixed and the hard drive hasn't failed so I thought it was fine but maybe this has something to do with it? This is the link to the apple page about the hard drive replacement program. https://www.apple.com/uk/support/imac-harddrive-3tb/ <comment318302> @TeamPaul I have an idea how the misery happened: a 2.2 TB start block limit may exist in the MBR. Then even after entering only 500 GB in Boot Camp Assistant (with a start block in the 2.5 TB range) the size of the Win partition will be extended to ~800 GB to keep the start block in the 2.2 TB limit. <comment318303> Shall I try booting to internet recovery mode then? Do I go on disk utility from this menu and then delete any partitions that are there to create one whole disk? Or shall I erase disk and do complete reinstall then recover files from time machine? <comment318306> I'm happy to wait, thank you for taking all this time to help me with this. Yes a how-to would be quite useful! Thank you <comment318307> @TeamPaul Completing another Time Machine backup cycle is always recommended (**and** needed) in both methods: removing the PV (because it might fail in your environment though it works here) or restoring the backup in Internet Recovery Mode. <comment318322> @TeamPaul OK, I tested the "remove the 2nd PV" scenario and it completely fails: your data would be lost. I will consolidate the Internet Recovery Mode path in my answer. <comment318340> Thanks!  I will try all this now! <comment319854> I think it has worked! For some reason when I was repartitioning the main disk, the name and options button were greyed out. When I did it my computer wouldn't boot so I did a reinstall of OS X (which was Mountain Lion in my case), updated to the current OS X, then used the migration assistant to restore my time machine backup. That seems to have done it! In disk utility it now looks normal. Now I need to decide whether or not to try Boot Camp again... probably not I imagine! Thanks for the help!
