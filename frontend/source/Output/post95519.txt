Whatsapp Notification to use number of people instead of number of new messages for push icons? <body> Sometimes I see Whatsapp with a balloon that says 8. It might mean I have 8 new messages from persons or 3 from 1 and 5 from another.  Is it possible to configure Whatsapp on the iPhone in a way that it shows the number of people that sent me messages? 8 messages from 2 people would show a 2 in the push icon.  So that a Whatsapp icon as such would give a number based on the number of people that have sent me messages, rather than the total number of messages.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6uS8C.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer95522> Not possible at the moment. Maybe you can send them a suggestion.
