Why is it that after moving my cursor around really fast for half a second, my cursor becomes huge? <body> If I move my cursor around really fast, half a second after I start moving it the cursor becomes huge. Why does it do that? Can I disable it somewhere in settings?  Note: I noticed it works with a few mice I have tried, and my built-in trackpad. I didn't change any of the default settings that should change this, so you might be able to do it to. If you need proof, I'd be happy to make a video.  <answer223287> Its a new feature in El Capitan to help you find your cursor in the screen ... its basically for old people.  <answer223318> Go to System Preferences - Accessibility and uncheck 'Shake mouse pointer to locate'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tilsz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment270684> Is there any way to disable it? <comment270714> @FlareCat Disable it in the Accessibility section of System Preferences.
