Trying to find file location of Mac Mail Smartboxes so that I can run automatic email archiver <body> I'm currently working on a MacBook late 2008 with OS X Yosemite 10.10.3. I use Mac Mail for my email.  I have created smart mailboxes to collect together emails that relate to a project number. When the project is complete I want to be able to archive the emails into PDFs and store them on Dropbox.  I have purchased Email Archiver for the purpose. Email Archiver needs the source folder destination and I can't find the smartbox location. I have looked in Library/Mail/V2/MailData and can see the SmartMailBoxes.plist but I can't see folders relating to specific smartmailboxes.   Anyone got any suggestions about how I can achieve this? Is what I want to do possible?  <answer197807> The smart mailboxes aren't real mailboxesâ€”they're just filters stored in Mail preferences. You can't find the location of the smart mailbox because it's not actually stored separately on disk.  <answer250239> el capitan = SyncedSmartMailboxes.plist
