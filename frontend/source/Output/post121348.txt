Move files to individual folders, using file name as folder naming convention for folder, using Terminal <body> I've been looking for answer on the web now for a few hours and can't find what im looking for. What i want to do is move each file in a directory to a new folder using the name of the file, excluding the extension.   /Movies/Filname.avi --- /Movies/Filename/Filename.avi  I know how to do each individual file, but can i do it reclusively for the whole folder using one command or a script.  <answer121363> This should do the trick.  precode#!/bin/bash shopt -s nullglob    #avoid problems in directory with no files ext=avi              #the file extension to search for for f in *.$ext; do     d="${f##/}"      #gives us just the filename     d="${d%.$ext}"   #strips the file extension     mkdir "$d"       #makes the directory     mv "$f" "$d/$f"  #moves the file done /code/pre  <comment141466> In the end I decided to write my own, not bad only that i have multiple extensions. I'll post my script in a few hours, when I am allowed <comment141478> Can you please post your script as an answer instead of adding it to the question? Would make it easier to other users to understand what's going on.
