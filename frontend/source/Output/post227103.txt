Using "tar" command in Terminal for multiple folders/files <body> I have many files like these  precodeSomeDirectory/RandomName.spa SomeDirectory/AnotherRandomName.spa SomeDirectory/YetAnotherRandomName.spa /code/pre  ...  I want to unpack every code.spa/code file in codeSomeDirectory/code to their each seperate folders, with the same name. I would use something like - codetar -xvf/code, but with what attributes?  Afterwards I want to pack every folder in codeSomeDirectory/code again back to codeRandomName.spa/code, (keeping the name of folder). The command would be codetar -cvf/code, but with what attributes?  <answer227133> Assuming that (1) the code.spa/code files are actually code.tar/code archives, (2) you are in codeSomeDirectory/code, and (3) that directories with the names of the archives you want to extract do not exist, the following piece of code should achieve what you want:  precodefor a in *.spa   do a_dir=`expr $a : '\(.*\).spa'`   mkdir $a_dir   tar -xvf $a -C $a_dir; done /code/pre  Or in case you prefer a one-liner:  precodefor a in *.spa; do a_dir=`expr $a : '\(.*\).spa'`; mkdir $a_dir; tar -xvf $a -C $a_dir; done /code/pre  The first line in the codefor/code loop strips the code.spa/code from the archive name and assigns it to a variable, which is used in the second line to make a directory with that name, and in the third line in codetar/code with the code-C/code argument.  The code-C/code argument in codetar/code only changes directory during extraction and doesn't actually emmake/em one, making things a a bit more complicated than they should be.

In a Terminal type `tar` and then control-click it selecting "Open man Page".   Then if you're still confused, edit your question and try describing in better detail. <comment275862> I assume that the `*.spa` files are actually tar archives? What happens if you run `tar -xvf RandomName.spa`? <comment275866> @user3439894 - ok, I'll take a look at it <comment275867> @patrix - yes they are. It would unpack the specified archive in folder. However I want to unpack all of the archives, instead of doing manually for each.
