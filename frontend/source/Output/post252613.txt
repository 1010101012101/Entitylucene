is an iPhone bought in the US compatible with Germany? <body> I'm travelling to the US soon and I would like to buy iPhone 7 (unlocked) from an Apple Store.  However, I live in Germany.  ul liWithout AppleCare, can I go to to an Apple store here in Germany in case something happened to the iPhone?/li liAre iPhones in the US are compatible with Germany's? Power/Energywise./li liDo I need extra/different adaptors?/li /ul  <answer252619> ul liYes, the service coverage of Apple products is worldwide. Though having AppleCare+ will save you some money because you may only have to pay for shipment of parts, etc. Refer to section 6.2 here./li liYes, as all Apple products come with standard power adapters and they're compatible anywhere voltage-wise, you may just have to use a universal power adapter in Europe. Otherwise, you can just use the USB to Lightning cable and use your own power adapter there in Germany./li liSee answer above./li /ul  <answer252626> I think it is available, as I bought my iPhone in Korea and use it in China. It works well and is same as the Chinese version.
