trying to find preferences.plist file <body> I am reading an old developer guide, that hasnt updated since 2007..  I want to access the file called codepreferences.plist/code located at code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist./code  It should look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cJ787.png" alt="enter image description here" However, at that location there is no such file. I only found codecom.apple.systempreferences.plist/code, but this is not the right one. My guess is that it was moved over the years. Where could I find it? It contains data about network configuration.  <answer232344> The location of the file has not moved. It is still located at code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist/code.  Please make sure you are not in your User's Library folder (code~/Library/Preferences//code).  The best way to go to the correct folder in Finder is to use the menu item codeGo &gt; Go to Folder.../code, or press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbdG/kbd, and enter the folder you need to go to. In this case, code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code.  <comment283884> thank you. You were spot on! so the ~ sign means user. Is it possible to go to /Library/... without typing in the path? <comment283885> Yes, if you make sure you have navigated to the root of your hard drive (`/`). This may be clicking on your hard drive on your desktop (such as `Macintosh HD`), or the same in your Finder sidebar, or by navigating to `Computer` and then the same. <comment283890> thank you! Recently switched from windows to start programming and I am still finding my way around. This was really helpful.
