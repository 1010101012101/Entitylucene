How do I stop a particular service from running? <body> I had previously installed an app for syncing my Android phone with my Mac.

You just need to run it on your mac and strongthen MobileGo can be installed/strong.      Link to the thread where the download is: Uninstall on MacOSbr Direct link: MobileGoRemover.app.zip  <comment335224> I had to use the complete path to the plist file: `launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.brother.LOGINserver.plist`
