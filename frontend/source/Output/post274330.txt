How do I specify icons in the favourites menu bar? <body> How do I specify icons in the favourites menu bar? I am running OSX Sirra. I would like the favourite icon for OneDrive to look like the blue cloud, but it always shows up looking like a boring folder.   I have clicked info and changed the folder icon, but it doesn't update the favourites bar. I did try removing it and re-adding it after changing the icon in folder info. That didn't do anything.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1yVqJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
