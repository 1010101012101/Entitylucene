Where can I find the task manager in Mac OS X Lion? <body> Where can I find a task manager in Mac OS X Lion? I want to see the processes that are currently being run, and I can kill any process I like.  <answer41126> It's called strongActivity Monitor/strong. You can find it in this folder: code/Applications/Utilities//code  <answer41141> A short way to do this is using the cmd + space to open Spotlight and then type in Activity Monitor (you should get the right suggestion very quick). I like this, because it's very fast.  You can also use this to start other apps or open files.  <answer188007> Look for the apple/Mac icon (perhaps top left). There will be an option for "Force Quit." Use that.  <comment46577> @Firdous And be sure to select 'All Processes' at the top right if you want to see everything.
