Why doesn't my MacBook Air turn off? <body> I have a MacBook Air that the lid I left open. The screen was still on when I left it. In System Preferences, I set it to turn off the display and sleep after 10 minutes. But it didn't turn off. I know that because the next morning, all the battery ran out. Why didn't it sleep like the MacBook Air is supposed to?  strongEDIT:/strong This is the result of the codepmset- g/code command in Terminal.  precodeActive Profiles:  Battery Power -1  AC Power 2*   Currently in use:   standbydelay 4200   standby 1   womp 1   halfdim 1   hibernatefile /var/vm/sleepimage   darkwakes 1   networkoversleep 0   disksleep 10   sleep 10 (sleep prevented by coreaudiod)   hibernatemode 3   ttyskeepawake 1   displaysleep 10   acwake 0   lidwake 1 â€“ /code/pre  <answer193769> If you run following command in the Terminal app it will show you what keep it from sleeping.  precodepmset -g assertions /code/pre  Then based on the result you can take a action.  Here is a example:  precodepid 251(coreaudiod): [0x0000000100000d01] 00:17:27 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: "com.apple.audio.'AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,1:0'.noidlesleep"  pid 251(coreaudiod): [0x0000000100000929] 01:11:47 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: "com.apple.audio.'BoomEngine:0'.noidlesleep" /code/pre  In this case it was the "BoomEngine app" preventing the sleep.  In your case:  You have the "magicwake" which is keeping it from sleeping.  That could be a Bluetoot coming from headset or external keyboard(track pad), or the battery is low.  It could be also a app that you installed that would wake up on network access.  <comment231004> was the lid open or lid closed ? there is a sensor in the lid that might be broken. <comment231005> the lid was open <comment231006> With lid open any app you have could have keep it awake. Was it connected to Internet with some streaming page ? So how does it know you want it to sleep ? <comment231007> It is connected to the internet with a static page I was reading. No streaming video. <comment231009> If you are handy with your Mac, open the Terminal app and type "pmset -g" then copy and paste the results here. <comment231015> Active Profiles: Battery Power  -1 AC Power  2* Currently in use:  standbydelay         4200  standby              1  womp                 1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  darkwakes            1  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                10 (sleep prevented by coreaudiod)  hibernatemode        3  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         10  acwake               0  lidwake              1 <comment231016> So it's stopped by `coreaudiod`? <comment231019> there you go, now you know :) it was playing or trying to play something ! <comment231024> to get more details about it type "pmset - g assertions" <comment231033> Why is coreaudiod active? <comment231035> "Coreaudio" is your audio device. Something  was using it. Did you had any music running? <comment231082> no music running. just a webpage I was reading. the volume was at 5 dots and no sound was going. <comment231083> did you try the"pmset -g assertion" to see the result? <comment231085> Error: unhandled argument assertion Usage: pmset options See pmset(1) for details: 'man pmset' <comment231087> sorry, i made a typo , not wonder it is 105 F (41 C) here. the correct command is "pmset -g assertions" I missed the "s" at the end :( <comment231090> pid 231(coreaudiod): [0x0000989a00010175] 06:19:05 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: "com.apple.audio.context91.preventuseridlesleep"   Created for PID: 211.     pid 69(hidd): [0x0000e8ce000905f7] 00:36:51 UserIsActive named: "com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle"   Timeout will fire in 578 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease    pid 26(powerd): [0x0000f10d00100185] 00:01:40 InternalPreventDisplaySleep named: "com.apple.powermanagement.delayDisplayOff"   Timeout will fire in 199 secs Action=TimeoutActionTurnOff <comment231091> Continued: Kernel Assertions: 0x100=MAGICWAKE    id=503  level=255 0x100=MAGICWAKE mod=6/30/15, 4:45 PM description=en0 owner=en0
