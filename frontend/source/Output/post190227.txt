How to get the call log from my iPhone in iOS 8? <body> I need to get the call log from my iPhone. What is the path to get the call log from iOS 8.3?  <answer190229> The call history is in the database located at:  precode/var/wireless/Library/CallHistory/call_history.db /code/pre  <answer206870> The iOS 8 location is code/var/mobile/Library/CallHistoryDB/code.

It's trivial to get the log by tapping the phone app. Please do more research and show that research before asking here. We've warned you several times about low quality questions. <comment226234> this works only in iOS 4
