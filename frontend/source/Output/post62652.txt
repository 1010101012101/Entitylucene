Copy contents of a smart folder to a new folder in Mountain Lion <body> I admit that my music collection is a royal mess. This is the result of merging many sources of music (external drive, old iPod sync, iTunes purchases, etc) into my iTunes account. iTunes Match has done a pretty good job of cleaning it up visually as I look at it in iTunes.  What I want to do is create a backup copy of all my music no matter where it lives (external HD, etc.) to one location and hopefully eliminate duplicates in the process.  More specifically, I setup a smart folder to find all of kind:music with a bitrate over 44kbps. This results in over 20,000 music files at around 485 GB. I now want to copy all this content to my external drive to ensure I have a backup of all these audio files.  I tried a simple select all and drag to copy, but that didn't seem to work. After a few days of Finder "not responding", I killed the process.  Some zero-byte files were created on the external drive, but no sign of progress after the first few minutes.  I'm wondering if there is a Terminal command that could reference the contents of a smart folder and copy or some other creative way to get this done.  I really don't want to mess with iTunes, I just want to copy all music files to the external HD. Bash script maybe?  <answer62657> You could use codemdfind/code in a shell script to simulate your smart folder's settings (mdfind is how you use Spotlight from the command line). Use codekMDItemKind/code to specify the kind and codekMDItemAudioBitRate/code for the bitrate.  Then you can use that list of files and copy them to your external drive.  Something like this script below. (codescp/code copies files to a server; use codecp/code to copy to a drive. Or, if you want to get fancy, codersync/code is generally better for incremental backups.)  precode#!/bin/bash  for FILE in $(mdfind 'kMDItemAudioBitRate &gt;= "44000"') do     scp $FILE myname@myserver:~/music-backup done /code/pre  <comment72364> Copying over 485 GB would definitely take a long time, probably 3 days at normal iMac write speeds. It would be good to divide the files into groups of about 10 GB, and work with them. <comment72378> This is a great start.  Thanks! <comment72738> kMDItemKind didn't work, but after some digging, I found that kMDItemContentTypeTree = public.audio does work.  This lists all audio file types, so may be too broad for some. <comment72739> @knipknup Yeah, I poked around with kMDItemKind and the only way I could get it to work properly was to make a Smart Folder in the Finder, choose "Kind = Music" and copy the number that it saves in the file.
