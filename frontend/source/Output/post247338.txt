How to uninstall application from iOS when there are many of them? <body> How to uninstall some application from iOS?  Please don't say to press and to hold an app icon, because it is impossible to find it visually in my case. My child downloaded a lot of games and made a lot of folders.  I need convenient way to delete application by it's name from alphabetically sorted list.  Is this possible in iOS?  <answer247343> You can plug it into iTunes and delete them from there by pressing uninstall, and apply.
