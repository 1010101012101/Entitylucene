Can Chrome be set to pin tabs after closing the app AND closing the window? <body> I was inspired by this question. It seems to be specific to OS X, but when I close a Chrome window with pinned tabs and don't explicitly quit the app, all my pinned tabs have disappeared. This is a real inconvenience, as resetting my 10+ pinned tabs everytime is not an option. strongIs there any way (settings, extensions, etc) I can get Chrome to remember my pinned tabs when I close the emwindow/em/strong?  <comment149326> please clarify "don't explicitly quit the app" <comment149327> If I go into the dock, right-click Chrome and quit, my pinned tabs reload. But if I just exit the window, they disappear. <comment149328> so the cmd+shift+T does not work for you?
