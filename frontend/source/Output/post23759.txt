RSS app for iPad, that support https? (ssl-over-http) <body> I'm trying to find an RSS-app for iPad, that supports https-protocol.  Tried strongThe Feed/strong and strongNews Reader for iPad/strong, but they don't want to accept links with https proto-supplied(rss generated from Pivotal Tracker, and includes latest tasks for project).  Any suggestions guys?  <answer23763> Have you tried Reeder? I don't know for sure that it supports this, but it might be worth looking into.  <comment26548> Reeder syncs with Google Reader, so the requirement for HTTPS would therefore lie with Google Reader.
