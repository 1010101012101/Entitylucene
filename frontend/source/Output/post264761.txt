Twitter giving an SSL error when linking to my site from the app on iOS 9 <body> In the last week, something has changed with Twitter on iOS so that when someone clicks a link to my site, it returns an SSL error. I've checked with my developer and hosting company and they've run SSL error scans and returned nothing. Maybe someone can figure out what the issue is here or knows what's happening.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIybA.png" width="375"  <answer264880> We were able to resolve this problem by adding ECDHE cipher suites to our SSL config. This is needed for forward secrecy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy ). You can check cipher suites offered by your service by using Qualys's SSL Labs Tools ( https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ )   <answer264881> The latest Twitter update (14 December - version 6.68.1) has fixed the issue for my site.   <comment331906> Some browsers are starting to check for OCSP [Online Certificate Status Protocol], and some sites don't handle it properly or consistently. OCSP is a means to verify that the SSL (TLS) certificate presented by a site hasn't been revoked. Some browsers will now complain if they can't verify the status of a certificate, even though the certificate is otherwise valid.
