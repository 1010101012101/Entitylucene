How to move photos or videos to another library using the Photos App <body> I'd like to safely move videos and some photos to another "Archive" library. (Then deleting them in the original library to keep it smaller)  How do you do that? As far as I see it's easy to start fresh as well as importing all photos from another library, but how can I selectively move photos/videos from one library to another in order to keep using iCloud photos?
