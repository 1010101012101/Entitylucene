VPN with two mac users <body> I have two users accounts on my computer, one needs to stay connected to a VPN while the other account, both being logged in, is not supposed to use the VPN. OS X 10.9 seems to only give me global VPN access or none. Does anyone know a solution?  <answer130082> I have a emvery/em dirty work around. So I hope someone will come up with a better solution.  What I did is setup a Virtual Box virtual machine with some minimalistic Linux that can do VPN. Once the virtual machine is connected the user can use the VPN inside the machine (but other users not). Since I needed to use some apps in the host system I finally set up a proxy in the virtual machine that would forward my VPN users data.  As I said emdirty/em...   <comment152341> Dirty indeed, I was considering a Raspberry PI solution, but am actually hoping for a 'proper' solution <comment152343> You are talking about a single machine with a single network connection with a single MAC address, etc.. Using multiple accounts on the same machine does not change that but using Virtual Machines does... With Parallels you could setup a MacOS VM that connected via VPN, that would be better than Virtual Box... Or maybe there is a way to use the WiFi or a Thunderbolt to Ethernet dongle to use a separate network connection and VPN over just that... interesting. <comment152435> Is the second user an adminstrator account or a standart unpreviledged one? <comment152459> User 1 is administrator. User 2 can be either or. Currently it is an administrator account
