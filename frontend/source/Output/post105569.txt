Can't make calls or send message, but receiving them is ok? <body> my problem is that I can not make any calls or send messages anymore with my iphone 4. When I call someone, it immediately breaks the calling procedure. And the message progress bar goes till about 90% and then fails.  But I can answer calls and receive messages! Internet is also working. (WIFI is off!)  Tried with different sim card, same problem. Restored the software, also didn't help.  Do you guys have any hints for me?  <comment124142> It is possible that one of your antennas is failing. If data works, I'm assuming you can send iMessage? I would also think Facetime works, correct? <comment124144> Yes, that is correct! <comment124217> I would consider scheduling a Genius appointment (should be free), if you have an Apple store near you. They *should* be able to test the hardware. You could also try restoring your phone: but I doubt that would fix it. To restore you would 1. Backup; 2. Wipe the phone; 3. Restore backup. (Or try it without step 3 at first and test, then wipe, and restore).
