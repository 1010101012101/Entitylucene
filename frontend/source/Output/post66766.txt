The file is:     /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreUI.framework/Versions/A/Resources/ArtFile.bin   Unfortunately I cannot open this file. Does anyone know how to open the file to see if that is the place where the images are loaded from?br When I rename codeArtfile.bin/code almost no application starts.  hr  Edit 5:  The Garageband application emdoes/em show the iTunes icon: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/78A6p.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer66780> Reinstall iTunes.  The icons in the Spotlight preference window and other areas of OSX are mostly derived from the application bundle.  It looks like the iTunes icon package has become corrupted.  A reinstall will eliminate that as the reason.  <answer69044> By reinstalling iTunes, did you completely trash the application and then copy it anew?  Sometimes simply overwriting the existing installation doesn't do the trick.  <answer69046> Type  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/ToolbarMusicFolderIcon.icns: /code/pre  into terminal.app to see if ToolbarMusicFolderIcon.ics exists.  If not, here is my copy. Download it and place it in:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources/ /code/pre  <answer69246> Have you tried resetting Launch Services?  <answer73252> Although reinstalling iTunes did not help, updating did. I just downloaded iTunes 11 and now all icons are back where they should be.  <comment78615> Did you try changing the icon for iTunes in the past? <comment78617> No, I did not change the iTunes icon. <comment78649> Reinstalled iTunes, restarted, but nothing has changed. <comment80247> That's not the right icon. On my system, both of the OP's missing icons are the iTunes app icon, not that one. <comment80264> That's indeed not the icon I'm looking for, but I also don't have the file if I use the command in Terminal. <comment80265> I used TrashMe to remove iTunes. Then I downloaded iTunes again from the iTunes website. <comment80447> Oh :( sorry about that then <comment80485> Thanks for the suggestion. I've tried it following the steps given in the link and unfortunately it did not solve my problem. <comment80656> For recent versions of the OS, it's necessary to restart the OS (the article by *The X Lab* does not mention this). [Why is a command line change to ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist not effective immediately?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/50004/8546) Consider disconnecting all backup volumes before and throughout the routine. <comment80660> @GrahamPerrin I've added the requested information to my question. <comment80661> I have restarted after the launch service reset. <comment80666> I'll be tracking this. I have the *exact* same problem, and have even reinstalled 10.6.8 (for something else, not this) along the way, with no change. It started when I updated iTunes to 10.6.3 a few months ago. It took several tries to get the update to install, and when it finally went through - no icon in several places throughout the system. Good luck. <comment80679> @soxman if you have the `install.log` files from that period, you could ask a separate (linked) question: *Why did installations of iTunes 10.6.3 fail?* <comment80688> @GrahamPerrin I've added the output, thank you for your active help with this question. <comment80695> That's also the wrong command. The icns file is not executable, so it will fail on any system. What you probably mean is `sudo ls ...`. <comment80701> By the way, I have iTunes 10.7, not 10.6.3. Does that matter for the question title? <comment80757> @GrahamPerrin unfortunately my HDD wipe and reinstall took place in between now and then. I have installed 10.8.2 on another partition (same HDD), however, and I can confirm that the iTunes icon is present. This was a migration from the 10.6.8 partition, though iTunes has been updated to 10.7 for both OSes. Super weird, so it must be some system-wide issue specific to 10.6.x running a busted install of iTunes 10.6.3 and higher. <comment80768> Actually it's not really a command, that's the point.. it'll either say if it's a file, a directory or that no such file/directory exists. <comment80922> Sorry! My mistake with the title - now corrected. (I had 10.6.3 in mind after reading Dock-related topics such as [missing itunes icon - MacRumors Forums](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1385338).\)
