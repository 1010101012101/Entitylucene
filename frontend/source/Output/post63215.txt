How can I sync multiple Google calendars in iCal? <body> I'm using iCal on Lion to sync with my Google Calendars. I set up iCal to use Google's CalDAV server and it successfully syncs my primary calendar, but not my others. How can I get it to sync the other calendars I have as well?  <answer63237> Create a new google account for each calendar.   Or ask your favorite search engine and find the answer quite at the top of the list. For example, this one http://www.ehow.com/how_8251009_sync-multiple-google-calendars-ical.html.  Added 2012-09-07:  It seems to be even much easier. Under Settings-Account enter the credentials to access the primary calendar on google. Then select the pane "Delegation". There you will find your other calendars, select "Show" and viol√†, they will appear in iCal (at least under Mountain Lion).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QIKCx.png" alt="Calendar Account"  <answer63340> I found the only usable way was to use BusySync which allows you to use all of the calendars associated with your Google account in a sane manner.  Nothing I tried before this gave me access to anything other than my primary calendar.  <answer83306> Since late 2012, you can add additional calendars to your main CalDAV account by going to https://www.google.com/calendar/syncselect. After you have done this, you can uncheck the delegate calendars in the iCal settings.  <comment73118> The calendars are on the same account though, that ehow link does not cover that. <comment73189> Added information on how to use "Delegation" to show all google calendars. <comment83336> it shows undr delegates in ical then, but there's a way to show them under google.
