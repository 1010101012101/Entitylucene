iPhone 4 volume is really quiet <body> I have a used iPhone 4 with 16GB of memory in it, running IOS 7.1.2. The problem with this iPhone is that the volume is really quiet whenever i'm playing music or making a call and setting the caller on the speaker.  The volume is currently at it's max (by tapping the buttons on the side).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFtZ0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  emNote: I haven't used the "broken" iPhone for this screenshot, this was just for showing what I did to increase the volume to the max./em  I have tried rebooting the device a couple of times already, this didn't work.  What do (or can) I have to do to make the speaker play at a decent volume again? Do I have to replace it?  <answer185934> For Music anyways, check your EQ in the Music tab of Settings. Some sound quieter then others and vice versa.  For Speaker Phone I'm not so sure, but as a universal problem it may be Volume Limit, also found in the Music tab of Settings.  <answer185935> My partner's iPhone is extremely quiet and tinny sounding (mine is not). I believe this to be blocked speaker holes - I can just about see what looks like chocolate blocking them! Is it possible that this is your cause?  <comment219376> This didn't work, the sound stays the same. Could it be the hardware? <comment219378> I've looked in the speaker and all i could see was just a tiny bit of dust. I cleaned that out by just blowing in it, it was just so little, so i dont think that would make a difference. <comment219379> do you have some non apple sound applications installed ? if not your sound card or speaker is broken. <comment219381> @Buscarì›ƒ Nope, the iPhone is wiped. Can you please edit into an answer? I now know what to do! :)
