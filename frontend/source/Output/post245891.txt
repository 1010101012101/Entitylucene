Installed gcc with Homebrew, now how to use that gcc instead of clang? <body> I installed gcc with codebrew install gcc/code, but when I type codegcc/code the default behavior is still to use codeclang/code.  How do I set things so that typing codegcc/code in the terminal automatically uses the codegcc/code installed by Homebrew?  <answer245893> You probably will want to examine your $PATH variable. The codegcc/code from homebrew should reside in code/usr/local/bin/code and that should be before the Xcode version of codegcc/code/codeclang/code.  If you change the PATH variable - be sure to log out of the shell or rehash the shell as appropriate.  <comment303192> Putting the homebrew gcc earlier in the $PATH variable than the Xcode version is sufficient to guarantee that the homebrew gcc will be referenced?  I wasn't sure how double definitions in $PATH would work. <comment303318> Paths are order dependent. Putting /usr/local ahead of /usr is a standard way to override the default application. I've seen people put a ~/bin ahead of that.
