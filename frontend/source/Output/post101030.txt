Mac Mail.app accounts offline after working hours <body> The Mac I use for my business is the same Mac I use for personal stuff. That's why I want certain accounts (the work related ones, not my personal ones) to go offline after working hours. My mail accounts are configured in Apple mail.app under the same user account.  How can I achieve this?  <answer101034> Couldn't you just set Mail.app to check only specific accounts, then re-enable them when you want to check them? In the codeAdvanced/code options under codeAccounts/code, you can uncheck the box to codeInclude when automatically checking for new messages/code. If this box is unchecked, this account will be ignored when Mail.app checks for new email.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AFHJR.png" alt="enter image description here"  The checking/unchecking of this box can be scripted using AppleScript.  precodetell application "Mail"    set enabled of account "NameOfAccount" to false end tell /code/pre  This script can then be tied to a macro in an application such as Keyboard Maestro.  <comment118976> Yes, that could be a solution. But that means I have to manually enable and disable the accounts when I start working and when I go home. I would like to automate this, if that's possible. <comment118991> I don't have time to formulate a detailed answer right now. But here's at least a hint for you: it works with apple script/automator. If nobody else answers you could at least google around. you should find good tutorials. <comment119015> @Stan, see edits above. <comment119025> That's super! Now I can add an event to iCal so the AppleScript will run at 9 am and 5 pm, thank you!
