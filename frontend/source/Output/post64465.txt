OS X: fsck_hfs unable to fix volume directory count <body> I'm running codefsck_hfs/code on a very large volume. Unfortunately, there's an issue it appears to be unable to fix -- it reports it, loops back to start with codeRechecking.../code, and reports it again, ad infinitum.  precode** Checking catalog hierarchy.    Invalid volume directory count    (It should be 513997 instead of 513998)    Incorrect folder count in a directory (id = 27444570)    (It should be 1 instead of 0) /code/pre  I've tried adding the code-r/code ("rebuild catalog btree") flag to fsck, but the issue still recurs.  <answer64466> The volume is probably locked, so you should retry what you are doing after booting into either the Recovery HD parition (Command-R while booting) or with a OS X install CD.  <comment76019> Checking the mount table, the volume is certainly not mounted anywhere (not even read-only).
