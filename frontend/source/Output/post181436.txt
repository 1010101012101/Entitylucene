Is it possible to change the face that represents each person on Photos.app on OS X 10.10? <body> I'd like to change the thumbnail selected by Photo.app for some of the people on the codeFaces/code album, but I can't seem to find that option. Also, consolidating some of the suggested names –which I suppose are contacts in some of the cases– would be great.  <answer181437> ol liRight-click on the codeFaces/code album you'd like modify, and click codeGet Info/code. /li liDouble click the small round photo that appears on the fifth row of the info pop-up. All photos in that album will now appear behind this pop-up./li liRight-click the photo you that you want to use as that Faces album thumbnail, and click codeMake Key Photo/code./li /ol  <answer181438> Also works:   ol liDouble click on the face album you'd like to change/li liSelect codeFaces/code on the second row from the top of the app (codeCaras/code in Spanish) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WYb62.png" alt="(&quot;Caras&quot; is Faces in Spanish)"/li liRight click on the face you'd like to select for the thumbnail and select codeMake key photo/code from the pop-up menu./li /ol
