How to disable "turn off display after" when using Apple TV? <body> I have my Energy Saver-Battery-'Turn display off after:" set to 2 minutes. This setting is exactly how I want power settings to behave when I'm using the computer on my lap. However, when I hook up to Apple TV for a presentation it still shuts off after 2 minutes which disconnects apple TV and disrupts the presentation.   Is there a way to have a different Energy Saver setting when using Apple TV (or other external monitor)? I frequently switch between using Apple TV and not to the point that changing Energy Saver every time is a burden.

With Amphetamine, a button will appear on your Mac's menu bar. Just click it to prevent your Mac from sleeping indefinitely, and click it again to allow it to sleep. This is a very simple method of keeping your Mac on forever, especially useful while downloading a large file or—like you're doing—AirPlaying.  Alternatively, you can use macOS's built-in command line tool codecaffeinate/code to keep your Mac awake for longer periods.  <comment291556> Welcome to Ask Different!
