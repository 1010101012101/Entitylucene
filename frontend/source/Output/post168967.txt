Two value-based axis for chart in Numbers 3.5 <body> I am trying to achieve a chart in Numbers 3.5 where both axis scale linearly.  Right now, my chart looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djb4x.png" alt="Chart"  Obviously, I want the x-axis to scale because the 100.000 bytes message is MUCH larger than the 10.000 bytes message, and the current chart is misleading.  I can't find a way to do this - the x-axis is always labeled as a "Category" instead of a "Value". Any way to achieve this?  <answer168997> Took me a while, but I figured it out: The solution is to choose a scatter plot instead of a line chart.  ol liSelect strongInsert - Chart - 2D Scatter/strong/li liSelect the chart, then select strongAdd Chart Data/strong: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ynkYq.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liNow simply select your entire table, including the x axis. Numbers will figure out the rest and automatically select your leftmost column as the x-axis. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oPe74.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liFinally, to make it look like a line chart, select the chart, then select the "Axis" tab in the inspector Chose strongData Symbols: None/strong and strongConnection Lines: Straight/strong./li /ol  Result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4T5y7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment198393> because your first coulomb is used as category, but you can switch that. <comment198395> but how? I can't find a way to switch it. <comment198400> what should be your x-axis (category)? <comment198413> the message size (as it is now), but it should scale linearly -- so I want the space between 10.000 and 100.000 to be 10x the space between 1.000 and 10.000 <comment198414> that would be a logarithmic scale <comment198415> ok, my math's not that good, but that's not the point, is it? ;-) <comment198426> No, BlackWolf, you are right.  You want a linear scale.  Buscar is confused.  BlackWolf's answer is also correct and the best way to do things.  You can't make a line chart in Numbers without an even scale.
