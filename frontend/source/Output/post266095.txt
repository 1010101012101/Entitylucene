How to stop Mac App Store from downloading macOS Sierra? <body> Today I've updated my 2011 15" MacBook Pro to macOS Sierra. After everything got updated, I've entered the Mac App Store in order to download Xcode. I saw in the "Apps Made by Apple" section the macOS Sierra, which seemed weird to be shown as downloadable, since I've already downloaded and installed it on my MacBook. I thought maybe it's a minor update, so I clicked on Download button.  Since then, it is downloading the full macOS Sierra. The problem is that I can't stop it. I don't see it in the Purchases tab and on the button where it said Download earlier, it's says now "Downloading". When I press on the option key to cancel the download nothing happens.  Can you please help me to stop the macOS Sierra download? It is slowing the whole Wi-Fi...  <answer266111> Even though you already installed macOS Sierra, App Store still allows you to download the original install file.  There are 3 methods to cancel a download in Mac App Store:  ol liYou can stop the download by going to Launchpad, click and hold on macOS Sierra and click the small 'x' button to delete it. This will stop its download./li liTurn off your WiFi temporarily and Mac App Store will show a message that the download has failed. Then, find the downloaded file in the Applications folder and move it to Trash. Empty the trash and turn your WiFi back on./li liGo to the Purchases page in Mac App Store, hold down option key and click Cancel. The download will be cancelled./li /ol  <comment333678> I don't see it in the launchpad, but I do see it in the applications folder with a small X above it. If I'll click on that X in the applications folder, it will do nothing to my computer, right? <comment333679> @IdoNaveh Yea, it will move the file to trash, try it <comment333680> When I'm clicking it, I see in the App Store a window, asking me if I'm sure I want to cancel or remove app, but when I click it it keeps downloading <comment333681> @IdoNaveh Try moving the file to trash and empty the file, then restart Mac App Store <comment333683> Still not working. It shows downloading yet <comment333687> @IdoNaveh You can go to the Purchases page in Mac App Store, hold down option key and click Cancel <comment333688> The WiFi trick worked! Thanks! <comment333689> @IdoNaveh You're welcome :)
