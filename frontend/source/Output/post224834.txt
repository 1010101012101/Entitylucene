Is adding root to the user group staff safe? <body> So it seems my library folders are owned by my user, and codestaff/code is the user group.  When I run commands in sudo, I get warnings from programs like codepip/code that root doesn't own the folder/file.  To avoid these errors, I was thinking of filing coderoot/code as part of the codestaff/code user group, then I wouldn't have any issues.  Is this safe? Why shouldn't root be a part of all user groups?  <comment272724> root is already a member of the group staff.
