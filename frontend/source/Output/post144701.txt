How to boot linux from an external hard drive? <body> I am looking into booting the latest Ubuntu distro (14.04) from an external hard drive using my Macbook Air mid 2012 running Mavericks. I've looked around and couldn't find a link to any step-by-step or instructional page to help me do this (or if its even possible).  <answer144768> That looks interesting but I am wondering why they tell you to boot from the 3rd party boot CD.  Once you have a bootable drive wouldn't just pressing OPTION at boot allow you to select the external Ubuntu USB drive? Or am I missing something here?  <comment170470> Could you link to the article you found that best showed what you wanted to do? What version of linux? What distribution?
