Point iTunes to restored content after PC crash <body> After my PC died I have started to restore my data from backup.  I have backed up the entire iTunes folder and successfully restored it.  I do not put my content in the standard location...I do not put it on the Windows drive for example.  Now that I have reinstalled iTunes, how do I tell it to use the content I restored?  Right now it just shows all my music as existing on the cloud.  I'm on Windows 7 64-bit and I have the latest version of iTunes.  I do not have iTunes match.  Thanks!  <answer162152> You can change the default location for the main mp3 file storage for iTunes, but not [easily] the location of the database files.  It is far simpler in the long term to leave the database in its default location -br codeC:\Users\[your name]\Music\iTunes/codebr This is also a folder you should recover from your old machine &amp; transfer to the new one, otherwise you will have all the music but none of the playlists, play counts etc etc. &amp; will have to re-import all your existing tunes.  You can, however, easily change the main 'content' storage location.  Go to Edit menu  preferences  Advanced  The first section is 'iTunes Media Folder Location' with a file path beneath [presumably currently set to the default location mentioned above] &amp; a Changeâ€¦ button to the right. This will allow you to redirect to your non-standard location.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKI2T.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you still have the original database successfully recovered from your old machine, then to save a lot of additional effort, make sure you put your content folder in "the same place" as it used to be on the old machine, i.e., if it was in codeD:\iTunes remote folder/code then put it in the same place again, otherwise it will lose the connection to your existing tunes &amp; again have to be rebuilt.  <comment189860> Thanks.  That helped a lot.  I'm up and running again! <comment189868> Glad to hear it ;)
