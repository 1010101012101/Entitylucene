Printer Setup Utility gone in Mavericks, how to set default printer in Applescript now? <body> I have some Applescripts that set the default printer using "Printer Setup Utility", that seems gone in Mavericks.  Anyone have an alternative to suggest?  <answer114632> You can use AppleScript to execute shell scripts, so you can use:  precodedo shell script ("lpoptions -d printername") /code/pre  Replace codeprintername/code with the actual printer name. It may not be exactly as it shows in System Preferences (I think ALL non-alphanumeric characters are replaced with underscores, but I'm not certain) so you can view your list of printers with:  precodelpstat -p /code/pre
