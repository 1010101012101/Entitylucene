Writing special characters to the clipboard with the command line <body> I'm trying to write the string codeあいうえお/code to my clipboard using the pbcopy command line tool like this  precodeecho あいうえお | pbcopy /code/pre  But what I'm getting in my clipboard is completely different : code„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä/code.  I assumed this had something to do with the encoding, but the documentation says the encoding is based on the LANG environment variable and mine is set to codeen_EN.UTF-8/code.  <answer130792> More than likely its your Terminal. Enter the command codelocale/code and see what it says there. If it doesn't list some Japanese encoding, that's probably what it is. Also, try selecting "Unicode (UTF-8)" as the Character encoding from Preferences..., Settings, Advanced, International. Also play around with Preferences / Encodings, enabling the Japanese encodings (is that Japanese? idk! LOL).  Also make sure to set codeLANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8"/code in your .bash_profile if it doesn't appear when you use the codelocale/code command.  <answer130816> I think your codeLANG=en_EN.UTF-8/code is the problem.  When I execute this command  precodeprintf あいうえお | LANG=en_EN.UTF-8 pbcopy /code/pre  and paste into a new emTextEdit/em document I get code„ÅÇ„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Åà„Åä/code (incidentally, this is what you get if take the the UTF-8 encoding of your original text and decode it as MacRoman; you should be able to verify this by doing codeprintf あいうえお | iconv -f macroman/code).  When I execute this command  precodeprintf あいうえお | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 pbcopy /code/pre  and paste into a new emTextEdit/em document I get codeあいうえお/code, just as one would expect.  hr  I am pretty sure that codeen_EN.UTF-8/code is not a valid locale (thus codepbcopy/code is defaulting to MacRoman). Maybe you meant to use codeen_US.UTF-8/code (i.e. codeUS/code, not codeEN/code)? You can list the valid locales by running codelocale -a/code. If you are just interested in English UTF-8 locales, you can filter the list like this:  precodelocale -a | grep '^en_.*\.UTF-8$' /code/pre  <comment153564> Well that worked. I dunno why my LANG was en_EN instead of en_US. Didn't even realize that could be a problem.
