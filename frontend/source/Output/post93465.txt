How can I stop/start all Mac OS X Server services at once? <body> When doing maintenance on our OS X Server (10.8.4), I need to shut down all server services one by one. While it is not too much of a drag to click all services off, perform maintenance, and back on, I wonder, if there is a way to automate this procedure.   Is there?   <answer93474> You could do it from the command line and/or write a script with the relevant services:  precodesudo launchctl list /code/pre  And for ssh (remote login) for example  precodesudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd /code/pre  Bringing them back up then with codestart/code (instead of stop)
