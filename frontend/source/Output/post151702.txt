phpMyAdmin 403 Forbidden Error after upgrade to Yosemite <body> I upgraded my Mac to Mac OS X Yosemite.  I had a AMP stack installed via Homebrew on Mavericks and it worked fine.  After upgrading to Yosemite, I have the following problems:  ol liwhen trying to load phpMyAdmin at codehttp://localhost/phpmyadmin/code I get the following error:/li /ol     Forbidden      You don't have permission to access /phpmyadmin on this server.   The error log shows: code[Mon Oct 20 11:34:17.235518 2014] [authz_core:error] [pid 70303] [client ::1:50374] AH01630: client denied by server configuration: /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin/code  ol start="2" liWhen trying to load localhost, I get a blank page.

It doesn't even time out. Just no response at all, and I have to ctrl-C to exit the ping. However, if I try codedig/code, it gives a response as follows:  precode âžœ  dig cs.dev  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; cs.dev ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 35355 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;cs.dev.

Ali  <answer152176> codeAH01630: client denied by server configuration: /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin/code  most likely means, that Yosemite upgrade changed file permissions on /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin or changed default apache access settings for the directory where you keep phpmyadmin.  You need to check 2 things:   ol lithat /usr/local/share/phpmyadmin is readable by your user and that directories that needs to be writeable by you are./li lithat you have correct order for Allow and Deny settings for that directory (you either deny from all and then allow from certain locations, or allow from all locations and then disallow from some)/li /ol  I don't know how did you installed phpmyadmin, but it might have added some config file for it's directory to /etc/apache2/other or /etc/apache2/extra.  <answer152290> I experienced something similar after upgrading to Yosemite and it turned out to be that I had camel-cased phpMyAdmin in the bookmarked URL.  When I changed it to all lowercase the permission error disappeared.  I know this sounds trivial, but I confirmed it on Firefox and Chrome.  I see from your log that this is not the case for you, but I thought I'd relate my experience for others who might run into the same thing.  <answer153944> I was experiencing a similar problem that to what you described.  To get dnsmasq back up and running, I changed the contents of  precode/Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist /code/pre  to   precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;   &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;       &lt;string&gt;/usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/sbin/dnsmasq&lt;/string&gt;       &lt;string&gt;--keep-in-foreground&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/31357 for more details on this and why it works.  <answer156374> Since upgrade to Yosemite updated your Apache, you have to update phpMyAdmin.conf to use new Access control syntax.  Have a look at: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html  In my case I need changed /etc/apache2/other/phpMyAdmin.conf  Order allow,deny  Allow from all  to  Require all granted  More info here: http://www.zoubi.me/blog/you-dont-have-permission-access-phpmyadmin-server-after-upgrading-yosemite  <comment178547> Can you post Apache Location / config and output of ls -laR on / Location? (remember to edit out critical data) - update probably changed file rights/ownership of files and it should be quich chmod or chown to fix it. <comment178583> Not sure what you mean by Apache location, do you mean the directory? <comment179066> That error usually means, that a directory from which phpmyadmin is served (where are it's files) is not readable by the user that owns apache process. <comment179072> Now, that usually is /Library/WebServer/Documents/ or /users/username/Sites. Apache should run as your user, so the directory where you have phpmyadmin needs to be readable (and some of them writeable as well iirc) by you. You also need to have correct order of Allow and Deny rules in configuration for that Location (there is nice explanation on it at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/upgrading.html). <comment262653> This worked for me too
