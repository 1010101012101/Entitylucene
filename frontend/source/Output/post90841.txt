How to use TeX Gyre fonts installed by TeX Live <body> I've installed TeXLive on Mountain Lion. The TeX Live Utility says that the codetex-gyre/code package is installed, however these fonts don't appear on my system and I actually get errors when trying to use them with XeLaTeX. What do I need to do to get this working?  <answer90884> In my installation (MacTeX 2012) the fonts seem to be located into code/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf-dist/fonts//code, especially into the "opentype" and "truetype" folders. If you can't find them, you can try running:  precodelocate tex-gyre /code/pre  Once you have located the fonts, to install them just copy them into code~/Library/Fonts/code (user-specific) or code/Library/Fonts/code (system-wide).  <comment106723> Depending on the nature of the problem, you might get better answers on http://tex.stackexchange.com.
