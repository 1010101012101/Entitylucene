MacBook Pro 13" 2015 CPU and GPU temperatures <body> I've noticed that my new MacBook Pro 13" 2015 (MF839) is getting hot while playing browser games or watching models at sketchfab.com. Both CPU and GPU temperatures rise to 100-105 degrees (Celsius) while playing agar.io or petridish.pw (for example) in Safari/Google Chrome. I've already reset SMC controller and cooler is working fine: about 3000 RPM, but I still believe that temperatures are very high for browser games.  Does anybody else have similar experience? Should I contact the Apple Center or it is a normal experience having such temperatures? I do not plan to use a MacBook for playing, just would like to know if it is a hardware problem, issue, etc.  Thanks in advance.  <answer223372> The high temps are mostly because of flash. Had a simmilar problem with my 15" macbook. I bought a fitting screw driver from amazon for 3€ opened and cleaned my mac and the temps went down by about 10°. Try it out it could help.  <comment270817> In my case it is not flash, but WebGl, canvas, etc. Macbook is a several month old so it's not caused by dust. Thanks for the reply, anyway. = )
