How can I save tabs in iTerm 2 so they restore the next time the app is run? <body> Can I save tabs on exit in my iTerm 2, so I don't have to open same directories again after restart?  Like Chrome does, for example.  I couldn't find such option in settings. Maybe "Arrangements" is what I want, but it seems that it requires me to explicitly save tabs.  <answer25084> You can Save and Restore Window Arrangement with kbd&#8679; &#8984; S/kbd and kbd&#8679; &#8984; R/kbd options under the Window screen in iTerm2  You can start the default Arrangement Option to enable are at strongPreferences/strong - strongGeneral/strong - strongStartup/strong  - strongOpen default window arrangement/strong .   You can add arrangements with the kbd&#8679; &#8984; S/kbd and manage them under strongPreferences/strong - strongArrangements/strong tab .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zw76z.png" alt="iTerm Window Options"  <answer81274> Coming in quite late, but you should first create some profiles and then use kbdCommand/kbd - kbdOption/kbd/kbdAlt/kbd - kbdShift/kbd kbdH/kbd (kbdH/kbd is for horizontal split; or swap in kbdV/kbd for vertical split). It will show you a list of your profiles and you can then add those to your split. Once you build the setup you like just like Sairam did above.   Here's a vid explaining: iterm2 Profiles and Window Arrangements.  <answer156652> It's still not exactly what you want, but since you can check the code$ITERM_SESSION_ID/code environment variable to see which panel you are in, by combining this with a saved window arrangement, you can have each of your panel to start with different initial path, or just anything you would like to run by default.  For example, my saved windows arrangment is two tabs with two panels in the first tab. So I will have code$ITERM_SESSION_ID=w0t0p0/code for the first panel in the first tab, code$ITERM_SESSION_ID=w0t0p1/code for the 2nd panel, and code$ITERM_SESSION_ID=w0t1p0/code for the single panel in the 2nd tab. 'w' stands for window, 't' for tab, and 'p' for panel. I check these variables in my code.zshrc/code, and run Vim in the w0t0p0, iPython in the w0t1p0, respectively.  <answer198245> Here's what I do, running OSX 10.10.4:  Install iTerm nightly (the latest release). Brew is the easiest:  codebrew tap caskroom/versions &amp;&amp; brew cask install iterm2-nightly/code  You can run this side-by-side with other versions; I use Spotlight and look at the versions to see which one I'm opening. By default it will be set to enable session restore which will restore tabs and directories. However, you may have to adjust your Apple system preferences in emSystem PrefsGeneral/em where Close windows when quitting an app. See this Gitlab issue for a screenshot if that confuses you.  <answer202815> If someone like me is having trouble enabling 'Session Restoration' in iTerm 2.9 beta (or iTerm3 beta how they call it) do next:  ol liOpen preferences/li liGeneral tab/li liStartup/li liChange to 'Use System window restoration setting'. Restart./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qsofw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Probably for tech geeks it's obvious that one should select this option for this feature to work but for me it was not and I have never seen this mentioned anywhere.   <answer209234> In iTerm2 v2.1.4 there's a setting under codeProfiles/code: strongcodeReuse previous session's directory/code/strong. It may have been there in the earlier versions, but I haven't looked.  See screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q82eT.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer214030> Try strongiTermocil/strong     emiTermocil allows you to setup pre-configured layouts of windows and panes in iTerm2, having each open in a specified directory and execute specified commands./em   img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TomAnthony/itermocil/master/itermocil.gif" alt=""  <answer224406> No, as of today I couldn't find any way to set a layout/tabs with paths and recover it (as Sublime Text does for example) in iTerm (2.9).  Personally, I'm astonished on how a basic feature (I think much more relevant than tabs colours, for example) is still missing on such a mature project.  <answer245804> This is possible with iterm2: https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-restoration.html     You can toggle this feature with strongPrefsAdvancedEnable session   restoration/strong, but you must restart iTerm2 after changing this setting.   I also had to uncheck "close windows when quitting an app" in my General system preferences: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204005.  <answer293694> I found the solution in iTerm2's official website, check it out here  https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-restoration.html.  After setting iTerm2 restores last session just like Chrome. However the process(e.g. npm start) can not be restored.  Works perfectly under iTerm2 build 3.0.14 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6 (16G29). Hope it helps.  <comment24927> [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home) will open your saved [Window Arrangements](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/documentation) if you need that and don't like iTerm or Terminal.app on Lion. It works on Snow Leopard as well. <comment24931> ouch, I had no idea that iTerm 2 is something different from iTerm. I used iTerm 2. Can it save Window Arrangement on exit? I couldn't find out how <comment24932> You have to explicitly save the settings from my brief read of the FAQ - we'll see if anyone here knows for sure now that the question is razor sharp :-) Nice edits. <comment124406> the one detail that was important for me here: first arrange windows like you want to have them, then hit ⇧⌘s and **save as 'Default'** (without the quotes, capitalized). the exact spelling is also shown on the Window  Restore Window Arrangement submenu. any other spelling will *save* the arrangement alright but *not restore* it on iTerm restart. <comment163970> This does not answer the original question of "Can I save tabs on exit in my iTerm 2, so I don't have to open same directories again after restart?" <comment171545> iTerm2 has no support for reopening directories. This ticket can be used to track the implementation: https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/issues/detail?id=2775 <comment199753> @JeremyLee Indeed. One will have to couple Window Arrangement with profile arrangement, like mentioned by Rob below, to achieve this purpose. <comment242752> This is a new feature in at least iTerm 2.9.20150626 beta. They elsewhere confusingly refer to it as part of the iTerm2 version 3 beta. Anyway, automatic session restore rocks! <comment243239> As new as this answer is, it seems that there is currently no iterm2-nightly Homebrew cask. <comment243296> Thanks David - I updated it to refer to https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-versions <comment258332> Can it also preserve tabs and the working directories of the different tabs (as asked in the question)? <comment258588> @patrix yes, it has to be set in `yml` file, however this does not restore tabs on iTerm restart <comment293929> this is uh-mazing, thanks <comment302151> This doesn't do what Chrome does, it seems. Chrome re-opens the tabs that were open when you last quit it. This seems to be more like something Internet Explorer did ages ago, where you could tell what it should open every time you start it, *regardless* of what was open last time. <comment369223> This is exactly what I needed! <comment370633> It's a nightmare, but really useful once you set it up. I documented the full process [in a blog post](http://blog.andrewray.me/how-to-create-custom-iterm2-window-arrangments/) which is too long to post on StackOverflow.
