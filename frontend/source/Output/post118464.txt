How to find out which terminal app (iTerm or Terminal) is running from within bash <body> I need to have different color schemes for each of the two terminal types I use. I can set it in the .bash_profile as mentioned here. But how can I tell it to differ depending whether its a iTerm2 or default terminal instance?  <answer118500> There is an environment variable set by iTerm and by Terminal as the following:  for Terminal:  precodeTERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal /code/pre  for iTerm:  precodeTERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app /code/pre  You should see this variable by typing in codeenv/code from the command line.  So - using this variable, you can put a condition in your .bash_profile file to select the proper coloring.  <comment305795> or just run `echo $TERM_PROGRAM `
