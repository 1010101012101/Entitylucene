Chrome Virus - Bueno Search <body> Today I suddenly had my new tabs overidden by the "buenosearch" website with no new extensions or apps installed.  I have followed all steps I can find online to remove this but it continues to come back. I have run Bit Defender's Antivirus for Mac, and am now running MacScan and Clam Xav to try and remove it.  Any help is appreciated!  <answer105133> I had the same problem. I'm guessing you also downloaded the 3d function for Google Chrome as an extension. Delete itâ€”that has the virus in it. That should fix the problem, I hope it works for you to.  <answer105173> I did it. What I did is very simple:  ol liDisable all extensions./li liOpen a new tab and check if the bueno has disappeared./li liIf it disappeared, reactivate extensions one after another and check every time if the bueno appeared./li liWhen it appears, remove the extension that is responsible for it./li liTry all extensions - it may be one of your old known extensions as it happened with me.    /li /ol  <answer105196> I went straight to 3dnator extension, and disabled it... It just worked! :)  <comment123556> You should have just googled it: http://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-bueno-search/. A) It's not a virus. B) It does not affect OS X. C) It's simply a chrome extension. Remove it from Chrome and you are good. Running all those AntiVirus software will do nothing. <comment123792> Can you explain how you did that? <comment124196> Removed 3d- nator and it owrked for me too
