MacBook Pro 2011 rebooting on startup <body> When booting up and logging into my MacBook Pro, I get the following error message:  precodelocalhost com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] &lt;Emergency&gt;: Boot task failed: fsck-safe localhost com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] &lt;Emergency&gt;: Shutting down in 3 seconds. /code/pre  This is an image of the error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6hSiz.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am running OS X Yosemite, on a mid 2011 MacBook Pro.  <answer155214> Hold alt during startup, you will then be able to boot from something called "recovery partition". When that is booted, in the menu select "disk utility" and try to repair disk and/or volume.  <answer155218> Based on the fsck error that would be your Samsung SSD failing.  Since you can not boot in Safe mode or any other including recovery, your only option is to boot from a external drive.  Then try to repair your hard drive.  <answer156233> Tried everything posted here and in other Apple forums but it wouldn't work. In the end, I booted using a USB drive and deleted all existing partitions on the failing SSD. Once all partitions were cleaned, I reinstalled Yosemite and the computer is up and running again.  <answer231338> Similar symptoms on my 2011 MBP.  The shutdown would occur during the boot process as the progress bar is loading, about 50-60% of the way the machine would just shutdown, everytime.  I tried resetting the PRAM and SMC controller as per Apple's instructions. This didn't help directly.  I ended up going into internet recovery mode, and attempted to use the Disk Utility to repair/diagnose the main HD. Disk Utility couldn't mount it or perform First Aid.  So I opened up the terminal and doing the following:  ol liUnlocking my encrypted drive./li liMounting the drive with codemount_hfs/code and specifically emignoring journalling/em. If this step succeeds, I'd spend some time backing up important files to an external drive or USB stick, as this may be your only chance to do so if you've got an incurable issue with your HD./li licodediskutil disableJournal/code on the drive after it mounted./li licodediskutil enableJournal/code on the drive./li licodediskutil unmount/code the drive./li liReboot./li /ol  Step 1 is explained here (archive). Step 2-5 are explained in a bit more detail here (archive).  My system then booted up correctly and seems to be working okay. I suppose the issue was a corrupt journal file that the system kept on failing on each time it booted, and by disabling/re-enabling the journal I effective "cleaned" it up. I can also confirm that steps 3 &amp; 4 cleared out some large code*journal*/code files in the root of the problematic drive.  <comment182556> Does it boot in Safe mode (press shift during boot) or in Single user mode (hold V) <comment182559> would that not be the cmd-r ? <comment182560> No, holding down Shift or V won't do anything <comment182561> cmd-r will directly boot the recovery partition, while holding alt shows you a list of all bootable partitions available. So both will do ;) <comment182564> the fsck failed means your hard drive failed ? <comment182568> I did not know that so a + from me :)
