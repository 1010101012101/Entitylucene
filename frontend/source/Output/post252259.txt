Prevent EarPod play/pause button from activating Siri on macOS Sierra <body> I have installed macOS Sierra.  I often work on my Mac while on the go, and then I play music using iTunes over my EarPods connected via the mini-Jack plug.  The button allows me to pause the music, but now in Sierra, every time I press it, I am asked whether I want to allow Siri.  Refusing will simply bring the window up again when I press the button.  I don't want to use Siri on Sierra.  At all.  How can I prevent it from trying to activate when I press play/pause on my EarPods?  strongAdded after reading comments/strong: When I emenable/em Siri, Siri emdoesn't/em activate when I press the button, unless I press it really long.  But when I emdisable/em Siri entirely, it asks whether it's allowed to activate every time I press the button, even if it's just a short click.  <answer252286> You can disable it entirely in System Prefs  Siri  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DXgFW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Pic from MacWorld : How to make Siri activate when you say ‘Hey Siri’ to your Mac with macOS Sierra which I imagine would be only of peripheral interest if you wish to disable it completely.  <answer252378> Sounds like a bug in Sierra. Submit a report. For now, enable Siri and just don't use it until it is patched.  <answer256127> It may be related to the fact that although you "disable" Siri, the process is still running. You can easily see that in the emActivity Monitor/em, by searching for emSiri/em.  If you try to kill it, it will be restarted by codelaunchd/code. To stop the automatic restart, disable it by editing code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist/code and setting codeDisabled/code to codefalse/code.  To do that, you first need to disable SIP (system integrity protection), edit code/System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.Siri.plist/code, then enable SIP.  <comment313969> This looks interesting, but it doesn't solve my problem. I have now enabled Siri, set "Keyboard Shortcut" to "Off" and disabled Siri again. When I plug in EarPods and press the button on the cable, I still get a Siri pop up. <comment317987> This also happens with the play/pause button on the [Apple IR remote](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/255115/macos-sierra-how-do-disable-siri-prompt). <comment318436> @jornane I have the same issue and one way to get around it was to enable Siri and set the shortcut to something weird that I'll never use. eg: Shift + Ctrl + Alt + Cmd + S.  This way Siri gets activated only when that combination is used - which I never do ;)  For extra points, hide it from the menu bar. <comment319059> @PaulArdeleanu - didn't work. Turned on Siri, set it to something random, turned it off;  pressing the headphone button brings up the annoying box. <comment319377> @GlennG No, no - you have to leave it turned on. <comment319570> Can't leave Siri on! That's the point of the question - getting rid of Siri <comment319571> If the Siri process is killed and re-launching disabled,  does this have any other side effects on the OS?  Also does this actually get rid of the popup window? <comment319942> It does get rid of the popup window. I've disabled Siri a couple of days ago, and I did not notice any side effects. <comment324287> @GlennG for now, this is the only solution (leaving Siri on) until the problem is resolved because as we know, turning it off has undesirable consequences. Until it is patched in the operating system, this is the best we can do, so submit a bug report. <comment324474> Wasn't updated in Sierra 10.12.1 - still shows the popup <comment326255> It works for me. Now, the earpods button just plays/pauses iTunes, and no dialog is shown. <comment329736> @GlennG Interesting, I don't get the popup in 10.12.1 now, but neither did I get feedback on my bug report. <comment332175> Sierra update 10.12.2 seems to have fixed this.  Broke other things,  but fixed this annoyance.
