Copy from `OS X` and paste using `OS X Screen Sharing` to a Raspberry Pi <body> I have a Raspberry Pi which I access from my Mac using codessh/code and codeVNC/code (codetightvncserver/code). I am using codeOS X Screen Sharing/code  I want to be able to copy from codeOS X/code and paste into a GUI app on the Pi. (Copying using codessh/code works as normal).  codeShare the contents of the Clipboard with another Mac/code mentions using codeEdit &gt;Use Shared Clipboard/code, but this option is greyed out when sharing the Pi.  Is there any way to paste into the Pi GUI?   <answer121224> The first thing to try would be installing codeautocutsel/code on the Pi.   You can find details at Raspberry Pi StackExchange.  Once you have that installed try both turning on shared clipboard and sending the clipboard from the Mac.  If that doesn't work then try a VNC client app such as Chicken.  <comment141305> I tried this, and rebooted the Pi (but not the Mac), and unfortunately it did not work.
