What do these different states mean for these Pages documents on iOS? <body> I am trying to open documents on my iPhone 5c's Pages. There are 5 different types of icons displayed, and I am unsure what they mean and how to open 2 of these...  1 - Default icon for Pages + Cloud icon in the corner 2 - Default icon for Pages + loading bar in the bottom 3 - Actual document thumbnail 4 - Actual document thumbnail + Cloud icon in the corner 5 - Actual document thumbnail + loading bar in the bottom  strong(1)/strong becomes gray when I tap it and I get the loading animation on top near the WiFi signal symbol, then the loading bar appears and loads the document, it opens and looks like strong(3)/strong. So I assume it's accessible and can be downloaded, then Pages generates the thumbnail.  strong(3)/strong and strong(4)/strong open more or less quickly, I'm not sure why one of them has a Cloud icon and one of them hasn't.  strong(2)/strong and strong(5)/strong become gray when I tap them, and go back to normal when I release my tap. The loading bar doesn't fill up. Most of my documents look like icon strong(2)/strong or strong(5)/strong.  At the moment, the page displayed on the iPhone is the page with all the  icons of my documents. The loading animation is not present near the WiFi signal icon on  top. Nothing seems to be happening.  emHow do I open these documents? How do I interpret the meaning of their icons? Is Pages trying to download them?/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVPFd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"
