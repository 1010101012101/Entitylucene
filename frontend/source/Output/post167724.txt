SSD: MacBook Pro Retina 15" (A1398) and 13" (A1425) compatibility? <body> Can I use an SSD from MacBook Pro retina A1398 in a A1425? Will it work ?  <answer167746> The short answer is emyes/em, they both support 2.5" 9mm hard drives (be that SSD or traditional).  The Retina 2012/Early 2013 13" Macbook Pro (A1425), and the Retina 2012 through to the Mid-2014 15" Macbook Pros (A1398), take the same disks.  Hope that helps.
