Quick Launch and Windows Menu in VMware Fusion in Unity Mode <body> When I run VMware Fusion in Unity mode, sometimes I need to get to the taskbar - usually to run Quick Launch programs and occasionally to open the Windows menu, but I don't want the taskbar always there taking up desktop space.  So - is there a way to set a key combination to pop up the taskbar, or simply toggle VMware's "show taskbar" setting without going through the drop-down menu?  I tried setting the taskbar visible and configuring the Windows setting to auto-hide the taskbar, but the auto-hiding does not seem to work.  Alternatively, what are people's recommended ways for launching Windows apps, opening Explorer, etc. - i.e., everything you usually use the taskbar for - while in Unity mode?  <comment75528> Okay - so I did not realize that the VMWare drop down menu also contains an applications menu and that you can assign a hot-key to it in "application menu settings" under the VMWare drop down menu.
