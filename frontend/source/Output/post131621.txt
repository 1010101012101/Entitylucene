How to clear OSX cached applications? <body> I'm having a very strange bug with an application. I've tried to update it but it keeps showing up the old version. I've tried deleting it too, but when I run codeopen -a MyApplication.app/code it opens it again, even though I'm sure it's not anywhere. If after that I try to install again the new version, it's still showing the old one.  So I assume OSX is caching it somewhere. Does anybody know where this cache is or how to clear it?  <answer131623> I had the same issue once. I solved it by running AppFresh and scan to check if all apps are updated. When you find the one that gives you trouble, you can right-click and choose Reveal in Finder, and delete it.  <answer131718> As to where it is...  The few times I used Time Machine it would find multiple copies of apps, upon closer inspection those apps were on the Time Machine volume. Do you have one of those hooked up?
