iPhone 5 show iOS 9.3.5 as available update not iOS 10 <body> My iPhone 5S shows iOS 10.0 in available update but for iPhone 5 it shows different. It shows iOS 9.3.5.  What's is the problem ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lCYKu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer253952> The iPhone already downloaded the 9.3.5 update and can't download / install iOS 10 until that is dealt with. Either remove this download from the iPhone, or install the update and later update to iOS 10.  To delete the update:  ul liGo to Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage./li liTap Delete Update, and tap Delete Update again to confirm./li /ul  <answer253954> It doesn't show as an available Download but rather shows that it's already downloaded and is waiting for you to hit the emInstall Now/em button so what you'd like to do is navigate to Settings  General  Storage &amp; iCloud Usage  Manage Storage under the STORAGE group and you could then delete the downloaded update.  You would then check again for an available update and iOS 10.0.1 should show up.
