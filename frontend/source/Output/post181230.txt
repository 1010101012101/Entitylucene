Is this possible?  Thanks  <answer181234> There are detailed guides at Apple's website. Here's the one for Yosemite. You can download a free application called Soundflysup1/sup if you need audio.  supstrong1/strong seems legit, download at your own risk./sup  <answer181305> VNC connection is rather slow and without audio. I would recomment NoMachine if You want to stream video and audio. It works really well especially on LAN. It uses video codecs and smart compression mechanisms to keep the stream fluid. Interface is not as good as native Apple app though. It's free for private use.  <comment215496> What kind of computer are you using? <comment215498> Great (Thanks!) that works for video, but no audio. Any suggestions? <comment215499> Imac and mac mini running Yosemite, also ipads <comment215524> It depends on your Internet connection type. If you have Ethernet on the master, then you can share it with others (via WiFi), if you have WiFi on the master then you can not share that. <comment215586> let me know if that does it
