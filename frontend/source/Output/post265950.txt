Mac slow down after xcode update <body> My mac is going very slow after I update xcode to 8.2 I checked activity monitor which is showing a process name ibtoold many times with huge memory consumption.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2NjTs.png" alt="enter image description here" Can anyone help please?  <answer265955> Did they finally disappear?  I suspect it was updating/recompiling your Xcode interface files and once done, these processes should go away.  <comment333473> What version of macOS X are you running? A poster in [this thread at Apple Forums](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/66551) says that upgrading to Sierra fixed the problem. And this: _"In my case, I noticed that if you set the root view's Top Bar value (Attributes Inspector  Simulated Metrics  Top Bar) from `Inferred` to `Opaque Navigation Bar`, it turns into hogging mode. Everytime you switch to this Nib file, your CPU usage turns up. Switching the value back to its default seems to resolve it."_ <comment333487> OS is EL Capton 10.11.6 <comment333488> I quit the xcode but the logs are still there in activity monitor <comment333489> Nope. They are still there. <comment333534> Kill them and see what happens <comment333563> Kill the `ibtoold` and `xcode` processes, then report back what happened. <comment333645> killed all the processes but xcode is still slow responsive. May be it's an issue with xcode 8.2
