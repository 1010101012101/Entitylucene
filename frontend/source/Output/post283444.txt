compress jpeg images from terminal <body> I am looking for a way to compress jpeg images on a Mac from Terminal. Basically, a library like pngquant, except it is for jpeg format.  Are you aware of a software that does that?  <answer283445> Use ImageMagick.  Instructions for macOS binary installation are on the linked page.  codecompress -quality X% source.jpg result.jpg/code  codeX/code is a positive integer value (i.e. 85 for 85%); source and result are the original filename and the output filename.  <comment357351> The question reads as if you are looking to losslessly compress a jpg file - which of course cannot be done. All you can do is make it smaller by making it lossier. <comment357352> Oh, it does sound like that. thanks
