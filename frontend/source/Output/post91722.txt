Can I disable Dashboard in Mountain Lion? <body> I'm wondering if there's a way to disable the dashboard in Mountain Lion.  I never use it and I think it's consuming processor and memory powers.  <answer91723> With macOS 10.10 Yosemite or later, you can go tobr strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongMission Control/strong and switch strongDashboard/strong to strongOff/strong.                                                        img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EPzBy.png" width="220"  On any OS with Dashboard, you can disable it through Terminal with the following command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  It can be re-enabled with:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  <answer93497> Or you could just uncheck the 'Show Dashboard as a Space' checkbox in the Mission Control settings  <answer94271> If you don't want to use Dashboard at all, free Apps are available to disable &amp; enable (if you wish to revert) it including:  ul liBye Bye Dashboard/li li‘Disable &amp; Enable Dashboard’ Utility/li /ul  strongEDIT/strong  Alternatively see also this Youtube tutorial published on August 9th 2013 entitled "Removing the Dashboard (MacMost Now 902)"  <answer105380> No hacks/apps or terminals needed.  Before you start you can Launch Activity Monitor and filter by dashboard to see this work.  Remove all dashboard items and see that the dashboard process disappears. Add them again and all is back to normal. And then use Greg's answer to remove it from Spaces.  <answer130928> h3To empermanently/em disable Dashboard/h3  ol liopen /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app/li lienter these commands, authenticate when prompted:  precodedefaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES; killall Dock sudo mkdir /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\ (disabled) sudo launchctl unload -w com.apple.dashboard.advisory.fetch.plist sudo mv /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.dashboard.advisory.fetch.plist \         /System/Library/LaunchDaemons\ (disabled)/ /code/pre/li /ol  <comment109750> This doesn't disable dashboard. <comment109981> Look in Activity Monitor to see how much CPU and memory it uses, I expect that it will be negligible if you have added no widgets. <comment126084> No, that wouldn't work because the LaunchDaemons are still active, and rebooting will only bring it back. <comment148439> Just what I wanted, as I was always accidentally moving to the dashboard when switching spaces. <comment150234> thanks!  I like the idea of the dashboard but the widgets available are absolutely terrible. <comment165238> Is there a command to automate it in Yosemite? <comment165240> @Allen Automate what exactly? `mcx-disabled` still works in Yosemite DP4 <comment165360> It does not work for me on 10.10 Beta. Actually some other defaults write commands does not work for me either.
