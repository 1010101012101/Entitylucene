Cannot copy from MAC to Pendrive <body> I attach pen-drive to my Macbook-air. It is detecting and I can also copy from my pen-drive to my Hard disk. But I cannot copy data from Hard disk to pen-drive. I tried with different pen-drives, but got the same result.   What could be the reason for that? I have searched on web a lot but cannot know the reason.  Thanks in Advance !   <answer230088> OSX is not intended to do this out of the box, it doesn't work with codeFAT32/code and codeNTFS/code, which are wide spread file systems on USB Stick Drives, especially on Windows.  ol liThe solution which works like a charm for myself is strongto use Virtual Machine on Mac, with Windows 10/strong installed. I'm using Parallels Desktop, because of speed and tight integration with Mac. But there are also other options, alike VMWare or VirtualBox./li liIf you don't like the idea of having Windows virtualized, you may try to stronguse standalone software/strong, which is intended for mounting NTFS drives:  ul liParagon NTFS for Mac/li liThe chain of applications Fuse4x + Ntfs-3g, you may find instructions here./li liNTFSFree for MacOSX/li /ul/li /ol  As @NetherLinks outlined in the comments, codeFAT32/code may also work on Windows, if you'll do the simple trick. Read below.     The Disk Utility advanced options of El Capitan are hidden and you   needed, first:      ol   liQuit Disk Utility./li   liOpen the Terminal utility./li   liRun the following Command:      codedefaults write com.apple.DiskUtility advanced-image-options 1/code/li   liRelaunch Disk Utility/li   /ol      And now, just format your USB with MBR Partition (Master boot record)   and exFAT file System.      The USB now can mount in OSX &amp; Windows.   <answer230222> The drive is probably NTFS, and OS X can't write to that. Either reformat it as FAT32/ExFAT using Disk Utility, or use an app like http://www.tuxera.com/products/tuxera-ntfs-for-mac/.   The current top-rated answer is incorrect about OS X not being able to write to FAT32 partitions.   <comment280738> How are the pen drives formatted? If they are all formatted NTFS, this would be the expected behavior. <comment280788> Thanks @Farside, I will try it... Upvoted !!! <comment280789> FAT32 is supported by OS X natively, both read and write. <comment280790> You are welcome! I knew it, because faced the same problem, and did investigation. Was really annoyed it doesn't work out of the box on Mac, but it does on Linux distributes, alike Ubuntu. <comment280791> @NetherLinks, you may post separate answer, if you want to show your knowledge. Don't forget to specify which version of OS is that. <comment280792> Actually @NetherLinks, you are right. I will extend my answer. It works, but with some tricks in settings. By default FAT32 formatted by OSX El Capitan, will not be readable on Windows. <comment280918> Is your Pen-drive formatted on FAT32 and are you trying to copy a really big file (4GB) onto it?
