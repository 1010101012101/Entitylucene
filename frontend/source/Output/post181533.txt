Changin IRC default client on Mavericks <body> I installed Colloquy and then LimeChat IRC clients. I realized Colloquy opens automatically when clicking on a link like irc://irc.freenode.net/kolab How can I changed these links to open in LimeChat?  <answer181539> You can set defaults using something like RCDefaultApp (old but free &amp; still functional)  Use the URLS header &amp; set your default app by finding the protocol in the URLs list &amp; selecting the default in the drop menu on the right.  <comment215904> works like a charm! <comment215906> Glad it helped :)
