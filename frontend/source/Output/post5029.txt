Does Skype work for the Guest login? <body> Skype works fine when I launch it on my Login.  When I switch to the Guest login, though, Skype launches but does not connect after 90 seconds.  Does it eventually connect if I give it more time, or is there some architectural obstacle that prevents using it as Guest?  <answer5081> You say that you 'switch' to the Guest login. Are you using fast user switching and leaving Skype running on your other account? It may not be a problem with the Guest account, but with trying to run multiple instances of Skype on the same machine.  <comment5162> Yes, I mean fast user switching.  I am not running Skype deliberately in my primary account, but perhaps it is using some resource behind the scenes, doing a background login or some such. <comment5198> I can run skype in my main admin login, and my guest login happily - but that's on 10.6.5 and the skype 5 beta - maybe upgrading to the skype beta would fix it? <comment18024> @glenstorey, I will try again now that 10.6.8 is out. <comment18030> It may depend on your firewall settings. I know from experience that Skype will bind to port 80 if that is the only path through the firewall -- it can't do this on two separate user accounts. Presumably it will work on two separate accounts if it can bind to different ports.
