Can't run vi from terminal <body> Every time I execute these commands:  precodevi /code/pre  or  precodevim /code/pre  in the terminal, it gives me the following error:  precode-bash: /usr/local/bin/vi: No such file or directory /code/pre  or   precode-bash: /usr/local/bin/vim: No such file or directory /code/pre  How do I get it to look at code/usr/bin/code instead of code/usr/local/bin/code?  precodetype -a vi vim /code/pre  returns  precodevi is /usr/bin/vi vim is /usr/bin/vim /code/pre  and  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  returns  precode/usr/local/bin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:/Users/carlo/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools:/Users/carlo/android-sdk-macosx/tools /code/pre  I effed up my settings when I was screwing around with MacVim and Homebrew. And now I can't even start vim with vi or vim.  <answer93036> Set your path to be the following and then you should have temporary control (or just unset the $PATH and type things in exactly like /usr/bin/vi whatever)  precode export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin /code/pre  Once you've confirmed all is well, you'll want to sort out the scripts that run each time you log in and set $PATH or just be sure that you delete things from /usr/local to clean up the problems.  <comment109159> What does this command return: `type -a vi vim` ? What about `echo $PATH` ? <comment109160> @glennjackman I added the output of these two commands in the question. <comment109162> What about these: `ls -l /usr/bin/{vi,vim}; hash -t vi vim` <comment109164> THANK YOU! That works. Do these settings go in a specific file that I can take a look at? For example, when I execute the command above, what file changes that makes the settings change? <comment109165> @glennjackman thanks. bmike's answer below fixed the problem for me. <comment109166> Why not spin that second question off on how to determine which startup files are being run. My guess is you'll need to list the OS version, homebrew version and perhaps look into what exact shell you use if you are not using bash (the default shell). <comment109167> Alright. Thanks for the answer though. <comment109170> A;sp note if you have /opt/local/bin you have also been playingwith Macports and only one of Macports or Homebrew should be used or you get issues similar to this <comment109182> Might want to look at your ~/.bash_profile to check for any settings that might conflict.
