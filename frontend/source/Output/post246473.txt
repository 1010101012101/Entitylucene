When I play music from a playlist, how do I get back to the playlist? <body> For example, in the Apple Music "For You" section, I start playing one of the suggested playlists. While that is playing, I am browsing around in Apple Music looking at other things (but still listening to the original playlist).  Now I want to go back to the original playlist. I can't find any way to do that, short of opening up "For You" and scrolling through it trying to find the original thing I tapped. (And it doesn't help that the "For You" section refreshes itself while I am scrolling, making it a frustrating moving target.)  <answer246490> Tap on the mini player, then on the "Up Next" button on the right:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SYGii.jpg" alt="mini player, up next"  You can edit the "Up Next" list on that screen.  When finished you can tap on "Done".  It shows the following 20 tracks, not the full playlist.  <comment303935> Have you tried the back arrow? Goes back in history no matter what tab you were in. <comment303936> On iOS I've tried the swipe-down and swipe-back actions. But that only works if I haven't "done anything". E.g. if I have scrolled around in "For You" to look at other suggestions, now I can't quickly get back to the original playlist, and of course "For You" may have refreshed so the original playlist might not even be there. <comment303937> Ahh oops I thought this was OSX question, sorry, no back arrow lol. <comment303972> Well that’s better than nothing. If only you could see the original playlist. <comment304044> @Nate you can always go to My Music  Playlists and look for it <comment304057> If the playlist was from “For You” or “New” then it won’t be in my playlists unless I’ve specifically added it. <comment304058> Right. Pretty confusing. Haven't seen the iOS 10 music app but it is supposedly redesigned. Hopefully this is one of the things they solved.
