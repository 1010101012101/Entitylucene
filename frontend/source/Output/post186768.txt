Share iTunes playlist with another computer (Different account) <body> I want to share my playlist with my friend. He can give me his apple ID. I have a big playlist on my computer. I have not made any changes in the Preferences yet. Help appleseeds?  <answer186776> Drag the individual tracks to a USB key etc - this will initially lose the playlist data &amp; only copy the tracks themselves.    To add an importable playlist to that, go to File  Library  Export Playlist, then save as M3U format &amp; add to the USB key. Your friend can then add the entire playlist by dragging just the M3U file to his iTunes - the tracks will be copied in automatically.  Alternatively, you can export a playlist by burning to CD/DVDbr Right click the playlist title &amp; click Burn Playlist to Disk.br I'm not certain whether this will carry playlist information or just the tracks - it's been too long since I did it.  BTW - passing around AppleID information is strongreally/strong not recommended.br It's the way to lose control of your own devices, if ever used maliciously.  <comment220593> Actually I know this. But I was looking for a way to share them without any physical devices but through the internet. Is that possible? Thanks for the answer anyway man! <comment220595> Live. No. Via email, dropbox etc, same as above. <comment220783> oh okay! I will give it a try.. Thanks dude!
