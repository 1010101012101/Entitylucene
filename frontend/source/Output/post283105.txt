Is there any app to always display time in touch bar? <body> I would like to know if there's any way to always display current time in the touch bar in latest MacBook Pro.  When using browsers and other applications in full screen, I'm unable to view the top status bar by default.  <answer283106> You can use BetterTouchTool to add custom widgets to the Touch Bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChrYv.png" alt="enter image description here"  that's the result:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kp82F.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's the example: https://docs.bettertouchtool.net/docs/touch_bar_widgets.html  <comment356893> Thank you @MateuszSzlosek. Looks very nice! Are there any free tools available for the same use case? <comment356902> @SE_User the pricing model is a pay-what-you-want model with a range starting really low. I think this is more than fair. Or did “free” refer to free software as in “free speech”? Then no, unfortunately it is not free software… <comment356905> @RaphaelSchweikert It may be really low when considered in USD, but it isn't very low when it's considered in INR. :) Ok, no problem. Will wait for some good open source apps or any workaround! :D Already paid so much for a MacBook Pro, not feeling like paying again for an app like this! :D (Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, it really looks good. (y) :) )
