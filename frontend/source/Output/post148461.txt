Desktop files and folders always moving <body> In OSX 10.9.5 my desktop folders re-arrange when a new window is opened. I have "sort by" off. I can arrange my folders and then when I open a new window (not every time) all of the folders will randomly rearrange to avoid the new window. What gives?  <comment177179> I have observed this as well.  Not sure what triggers it.  In my experience, sometimes a few files on the desktop are moved randomly, sometimes they all snap to grid w/o any prompting. Quite annoying since I tend to group things.
