How can I use a Linux box's display as a third display for my MacBook Pro? <body> At work, I have a MacBook Pro that I use as my primary machine. I also have a RHEL6 box that has a dual-head graphics card. When my KVM is switched to the Mac, the second display that is hooked to the Linux box is not being used.  I know there is software the enable other computers to act as displays over a network without an additional physical display connection. Is there software that supports a Linux workstation being the third display for my Mac?  <answer38567> I'm not 100% sure if it'll meet your needs, but Synergy works very well as a software KVM and it supports any mix of OS X, Linux and Windows.   <comment43447> I haven't done the research to see if AirDisplay or Screen Recycler work with a linux client.

Will research more about Linux support. <comment43668> Not exactly related to the question, but it seems like pretty cool software none the less. <comment43731> Yeah, I've been using Synergy for a while. It is very cool software, but not what I'm looking for here. <comment44064> I went ahead and accepted @mjturner's answer since it actually is a good alternative solution. I'm instead using the linux box as a secondary viewer of things like a browser so it works for my purposes until something better comes along. <comment108552> Hi @KyleHayes, did you find an answer to your question? Does Synergy do what you were trying to? <comment347815> @mjturner's does not answer your question. You accept answers that are correct, not the ones you like.
