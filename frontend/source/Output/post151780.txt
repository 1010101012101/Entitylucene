How can I change the position and size of an image in Apple pages 5.5? <body> How can I change the position and size of an image in Apple pages 5.5? I have tried all the things I used to do but now when I import a photo, the handle bars do not show up, nor does the image editor as it used to do when clicking on the image.  <answer151797> The photo must be selectable and selected for you to be able to manipulate it.br If the image is locked, unlock it with ⌥⌘L.                                              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5WWoQ.gif" alt=""
