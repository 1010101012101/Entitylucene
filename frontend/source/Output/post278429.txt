What happens to Airdropped files on the iPad that do not prompt the user to open an app? <body> When I airdrop a file to my iPad with no app installed to handle the filetype, the prompt still appears on the iPad that the file is being transferred. When the prompt completes, nothing happens.  Where does that file go? Is it still stored on my iPad until an appropriate app is installed? Is it deleted on the spot. If not, how do I delete it?
