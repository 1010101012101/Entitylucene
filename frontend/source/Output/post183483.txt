Using a headset with a Macbook pro mid 2009 <body> Does this Macbook support any kind of dual 3.5mm connection headsets ? Acording to this link there is in fact an audio in port but I have never seen that symbol for "audio in" been used  <answer183487> That symbol indicates "Audio line in/optical digital audio in port".   It is a combo port, and it supports Optical connection.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IJp2W.jpg" alt="OPTICAL"
