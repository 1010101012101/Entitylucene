How to watch air broadcasted TV with VLC Player on a Mac <body> I want to watch my air broadcasted TV with VLC Player on a Mac.  I have a standard European TV connection (free air-broadcasted TV), and I would guess I need some sort of USB TV tuner to connect the antenna cable to my Mac.  Can I just buy any USB TV tuner, or do I need to get anything specific?  Could you give me an example of device I need to buy? I'm not asking for suggestions about what to buy, but just an example to define the category.  <answer44291> Do you have any particular reason for needing to use VLC? If you don't you could try EyeTV as it supports a good range of tuners (mine is a miglia) and has a streaming app for the iPhone / iPad   http://www.miglia.com/ http://www.elgato.com/  Elgato also do network aware tuners  <answer44316> No the apple TV isn't a tuner, just a media streaming device (the original one also had a hdd to store files)  <comment50297> How is it both "cable" and "air-broadcasted"? One precludes the other. <comment50302> @TimothyMueller-Harder Let's be more pedantic :) Perhaps the *cable* being referred to isn't really meant as "cable TV", as in a paid-for programming service delivered into the domicile over a cable from outside, but rather a reference to the antenna device's cable.  Even antennas need to be connected to a TV or computer with a **cable**. <comment50303> @ChrisW.Rea He says, "I want to watch my cable TV." That doesn't sound like he means, "I want to watch TV using a cable that is connected to my TV antenna," to me. <comment50304> @TimothyMueller-Harder But the OP also referred to "free air-broadcasted TV", which contradicts the kind of "cable TV" you're interpreting it to mean.  Yes, there's some confusion in the choice of words. <comment50306> @ChrisW.Rea My point exactly. :) <comment50314> @ChrisW.Rea The cable is connecting my antenna to the tv indeed. Ive updated the question <comment50326> It sounds good, I need tips like this one, thanks <comment50327> Ps. Is appleTV a tv tuner as well? <comment50395> Please remove this as an answer and add it as a comment to the above thread. Thank you! <comment50723> So, I've bought EyeTV Hybrid from Elgato. It works, but the image is a bit pixelated, not very good quality, like on a normal TV. I've tried to unplug plugs cables, USB stick, restarting mac, etc, but it is the same. And in the settings I can see the strength of the signal is 100% and its' quality is between 90 and 95%
