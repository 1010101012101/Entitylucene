MacBook display has vertical black and white lines on startup <body> My MackBook, on startup, its showing the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xaPFS.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  They are just a bunch of vertical black and white lines, and it gets stuck there.  What could be the problem?  <answer281952> It's definitely hardware.  It's either the display has gone bad or your GPU (logic board) has gone bad (most likely case)  The first thing I would do is hook it up to an external monitor.  If it's present there as well, then you know it's GPU/logic board related.   If it goes away, then run Apple Hardware Test (AHT) to get some details.  (Hold the D key while booting from a powered off state with the AC adapter connected)  Either way, you will need to take it in for service.  <comment354916> Can you provide your Macbook model & os version ? <comment355154> Its 2006 Macbook <comment355155> This is the link for the specs of my macbook http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/specs/macbook_2.0_white.html
