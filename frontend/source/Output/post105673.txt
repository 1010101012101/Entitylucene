Disk Utility won't Unmount HD for formatting <body> I have two internal drives in my 27" iMac (10.8.5). An SSD system disk and a 1TB SATA drive.  The HDD has been acting up recently, very slow performance, bad behavior etc. Tech Tool Pro and Disk Utility don't seem to be able to fix the drive, so I decided to wipe the data by a reformat and writing zeros to the entire drive.  Everytime I try and format, it tells me that the drive cannot be unmounted. I have rebooted a few times, and spent days running everything from TechTool Pro on it and it won't go.  precode$ diskutil list disk2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *4.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     314.6 MB   disk2s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Everest                 4.0 TB     disk2s2  $ diskutil repairVolume /dev/disk2s2 Started file system repair on disk2s2 Everest Updating boot support partitions for the volume as required Error: -69673: Unable to unmount volume for repair  $ diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Everest /dev/disk2 Started erase on disk2 Unmounting disk Error: -69888: Couldn't unmount disk /code/pre  Any thoughts on how to get it to unmount and reformatted? Is there a way in Terminal to do this instead?  <answer105674> You can force unmount a drive by running the following Terminal command:  precodediskutil unmountDisk force /Volumes/VOLUMENAME /code/pre  supReplace codeVOLUMENAME/code with the name of a volume on the disk you are trying to unmount./sup  Following this, attempt to Erase/Partition the drive again in Disk Utility. Using the above command can interrupt file read/writes, which can cause file corruption. However, since you are erasing the drive anyway, this doesn't really matter in your situation.  <answer134889> If you have a PC download transmac trial start in administrator mode plug your disk in via usb.  Locate your drive and right click on it. If you have an image you would like to clone to it use the clone option. Otherwise use format and choose HFS+ plug the hard drive into your Mac again and it should format no problem.  Worked for me this morning. Took about 5-10 minutes.  <answer230216> Disable Spotlight for that Hard Drive (System Preferences)  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1454712?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer255065> Try to use umount -f /Volumes//  <answer272468> When a disk is first connected, macOS helpfully tries to run fsck on the volume. If the volume is large or has extensive problems, this process can run for a long time before it fails.  The following Terminal command should identify the process at fault:  precodesudo lsof | grep diskn /code/pre  replacing diskn with the number of the offending disk.  Once you have the process ID, you can kill it thus:  precodesudo kill -9 pid /code/pre  replacing pid with the process ID determined above.  Then you can run diskutil normally, either from GUI or command line.  <comment124244> Thanks! It is now writing zeros to the drive. <comment211097> @bmike Since it's unclear, if it's really a duplicate of the [linked](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178237/cant-erase-unmountable-external-hd?lq=1) question, i wouldn't add the diskutil list here. Actually I think the reasons are different: here probably a degraded hdd, there a wrong EFI size and therefore an unreadable or partly overwritten HFS+ volume. The symptoms (unable to unmount) and the solution (force unmount) are probably the same though. <comment222023> Transmac worked for me also. Spent hours trying other solutions, but this worked straight away! <comment252032> Thanks.  Combining this with ^ ... worked perfectly.  Apple - please make your GUI stronger. <comment253673> no most likely an early fusion drive <comment275614> Didn't have a volume to unmount; unmounted the disk device instead (with `N` being 3 in my case): `diskutil unmountDisk force /dev/diskN` <comment297637> I was able to unmount the disks using above solution. But now I am getting following error while trying to erase  or paritition primary internal HD: "wiping volume data to prevent future accidental probing failed". Any help is greatly appreciated. <comment297649> @Ab'initio This should be a separate question rather than a comment. Make sure to search before asking. <comment317633> Welcome to Ask Different!
