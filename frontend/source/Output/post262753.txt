Apple Remote not pairing on El Capitan <body> After a while I had my Apple Remote not working since battery was exhausted. Today I changed it and tried to re-pair the remote with my MacBook Pro (that meanwhile underwent several clean installations) that is on 10.11.6 with a strongcase-sensitive/strong (in general is case-insensitive) HFS partition.  I'm following the instructions and pressing the strongMenu/strong + strongNext/strong doesn't trigger anything.   I checked the IR with the camera of the MBP and I can see clearly the light blinking.   Reading on internet the service that is responsible of this is described in code/System/Library/LaunchDaemon/com.apple.remotepairtool.plist/code that results also already loaded. But not pairing. codeSystem Preferences &gt; Privacy &gt; Advanced/code has the option for the IR correctly unticked.   Any ideas?  <comment329170> I also tried on two other MacBook Pro, always on 10.11.6 and the pairing is not working.   I also tried [Candelair](https://www.iospirit.com/labs/candelair/) software but still no pairing. It seems a bug. <comment329174> I also tried to reset NVRAM and SMC. No Luck.
