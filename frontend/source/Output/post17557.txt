How can I disable the random/auto keeping of apps in the Dock? <body> Sometimes the Dock will keep an icon app in the Dock, even though I haven't set it as such, even though I've previously de-kept it in Dock after the first time it kept it 'for me'.   Is there a way to turn this off it's a bit annoying?   <answer17559> Usually apps don't place themselves in the dock without your consent or knowledge. There are a couple ways to put them there though. Perhaps you may not realize it, but it may be one of these reasons:  ol liThe App Store will place an app in the Dock upon installation. Note: Lion will not do this though; it simply places it in Launchpad./li liThe App Store will place an app in the Dock upon updating an app. Note: Updating an non-docked app individually via the updates tab is when it gets re-placed in the dock. However using the 'Update All' button at the top of the page will not do any such thing. Again, this is changed in Lion./li liIf you run an app that is not kept in the dock and drag it to another position anywhere on the dock, it will stay in the dock/li liDrag an app into the dock from Finder/li liRight click an app in the dock an under options select 'Keep in Dock'/li /ol  <comment19160> Are the affected apps random or consistent? Meaning are they the same apps or does it happen to nearly all the apps. <comment19174> +1 - HandyRandy is all over this one - excellent! <comment19401> Also, if the dock icon goes away after quitting the app but comes back after a fresh login, then the “Open at Login” option (also ‘in’ the dock icon with “Keep in Dock”) could be the problem. One more: a locked (or read only?) `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist` can cause *Dock* settings to revert at each login (see [AD 17223](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17223/i-cant-save-my-system-preferences)). <comment19405> @Chris those are great suggestions. I think they deserve to be presented as an alternate answer. <comment19424> It very well might be the moving of icon around the dock, never connected those to actions together. Thx! <comment106764> Quite often I mis-time my click, do it while the cursor is still moving, and end up dragging the icon for a fraction of a second. Result: icon kept in dock, even though I've not asked for that and haven't even rearranged the icons. (I only figured this out today, but I must have been doing it for years without realising this was the cause of the odd icon mysteriously sticking to the dock. Perhaps this hint will help somebody else.) <comment281783> #3 was a huge surprise to me and finally answered this annoying mystery! Thanks Randy.   I would next like to know if one can disable this behavior: I would really like to be able to rearrange my icons for the task-at-hand without having all of those apps preserved forever in the dock. <comment369752> I think the issue is apps that you previously dismissed from the dock seem to automatically stay if you keep them open longer than, say, a day. I would like to know how to disable this feature as well
