How can you transfer movies from vlc to cinexplayer <body> I have some movies on my ipad which I downloaded using vlc from my local PC. I would like to play them with cinexplayer (or any other player anyone can recommend) as vlc isn't as good as I was hoping on an ipad.  Is this possible?  <comment241132> Is there a cinexplayer app for ipad? or are you looking for a app <comment241133> @Buscar웃 There is indeed https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/cinexplayer-hd-best-way-to/id384098375?mt=8 <comment241134> what confuses me the VLC normally does not do downloads. What is the file format you have? <comment241136> @Buscar웃 It does indeed! http://www.igeeksblog.com/how-to-transfer-movies-videos-to-vlc-for-iphone-ipad-using-wi-fi-upload/ <comment241137> OK,  my mistake, what you are talking is Transfer (from one device to another) I was thinking Download (from the web). Anyway, what is the original file type ?
