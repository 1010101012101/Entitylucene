Recover Apple ID despite deleting email address and not being able to answer the security questions <body> I have an old Apple ID that I've lost access to because I deleted the email address it was tied to and I can't remember the security answers to anymore. I have some purchases tied to it, but the credit card info has been long removed -- it'd be expired by now, anyway. I called Apple Security, but was unable to regain access. Still, I'm wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and how they went about recovering their account.  <answer65490> It’s not possible anymore to recover your Apple ID over the phone. You could, in the past, but not now. Consider your Apple ID dead. And they won’t make an exception.
