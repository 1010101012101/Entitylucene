Unable to remove phantom iTunes storage under the new mac storage management tool <body> The storage tool, opened from emAbout This Mac/em, shows there is 30.15GB of iTunes data. I went into the iTunes root folder and removed all the music and podcasts. The 30.15GB remains. I have tried restarting the mac. Is this a bug or is there somewhere else I should look to delete this 30.15GB of data?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gfDw4.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I1kd0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer281382> Be patient. It takes some time for the Mac to rebuild the index that determines the (exact) size of each section.  Keep a mobile Mac connected to a power source if you want to accelerate the process.  You could also rebuild the spotlight cache, but it's barely worth it just to update the view.  <comment354558> Thanks but it has been 4 days. The iTunes storage stays at 30.15GB. <comment354563> @VictorYip have you tried doing a spotlight re-index before? <comment355716> I find this link on how to do the re-indexing   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716  But I am not sure if I should just uncheck and recheck the items under "search result" or manually add them to the privacy tab and remove them to trigger the indexing.
