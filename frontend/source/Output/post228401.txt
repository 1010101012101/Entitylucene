Flashtool does not convert .swf to .png, says JPEG library not compiled <body> I've made this sh script to convert a bunch of swf files in a directory to pngs.  codefor img in *.swf; do swfrender "$img" -o "$img.png"; done;/code  This gives codeError: No JPEG library compiled inrfxswf:/code  I've tried variants of this script, and they give the same error.  I am running El Capitan, and I have codelibjpeg/code and codeflashtools/code installed via brew.
