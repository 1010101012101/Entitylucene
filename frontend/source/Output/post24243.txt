Mixx midi controller software won't load <body> I downloaded 'Mixx' from the app store to use with a Numark total control midi controller but the app will not load. The icon bounces up and down in the dock and I have to 'force close'. Anyone have any suggestions why this is and how I can fix it.   It no solution any free software that I can connect to a midi controller for live mixing. On a separate note looking to connect an Akai mpd 24 for live mixing.
