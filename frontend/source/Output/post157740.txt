Multiple empty Chrome/Google setup volumes in root Finder folder <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eMeMy.png" alt="enter image description here"  Unknown Reason for Excessive repetitive removable volumes with either no files inside or inaccessible directories. I have been getting these artifacts as seen in the image since installing OS X Yosemite. Very mysterious. Anyone with similar errors or with an explaination, or even better - a solution, I would be most grateful to hear from you.  Thanks.  <answer157756> I'm having a similar problem, though I haven't seen the Chrome Canary folders. I've tried two things now (one in the last few minutes, so let's see if it works this time).  First, open Applications  Utilities  Terminal and copy/paste the following:  precodecd /tmp sudo rm -rf 2014* /code/pre  At this point you will be prompted for a password. Enter the password you use to login to your Mac.  Then copy/paste this line:  precodeopen . /code/pre  You should have a Finder window popup. On the sidebar, click on your computer's name and make sure that you don't see any of the Google/Chrome folders.  Second, uninstall the Google Voice and Video plugin. It can be reinstalled if needed in the future, but the uninstall/reinstall process seems to prevent these volumes from showing up again for some people.  Again in Terminal, copy/paste the following:  precode/Library/Application\ Support/Google/GoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller.app/Contents/MacOS/GoogleVoiceAndVideoUninstaller /code/pre  Press Enter and a dock icon should appear, along with a small window requesting credentials. Enter your Mac login password again and after a minute, it should tell you that Google Voice and Video was uninstalled.  You may have luck with uninstalling and reinstalling Chrome Canary if this didn't fix those folders.  <comment185498> How many  times did you click on download? <comment185503> I removed the portion of your question dealing with "Computer Name (2)" etc. Please try to stick to one question per topic - in this case, they aren't related. The "Computer Name (2)" issue has an answer [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/153080/computer-name-keeps-changing-osx-10-10-14a389/157114#157114). <comment185504> @Buscarì›ƒ The OP didn't click to download anything. These are being generated automatically by Chrome somehow. I am having the same issue and have had Chrome installed for years. <comment185513> Try the Google uninstaller in /Library/Application Support/Google <comment187571> Thank You @tubedogg for the helpful answer.
