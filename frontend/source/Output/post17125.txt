Is there a way to auto-paginate "Page 1 of 3" in Pages? <body> Is there a way to auto-paginate with "1 of 3" "2 of 3" "3 of 3"?  <answer17132> Yes. Pages 09 certainly has this.  In the insert menu you should use both page number and page count to get page 2 of 3. You can use these anywhere, not just in the header or the footer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3FMoD.png" alt="enter image description here"
