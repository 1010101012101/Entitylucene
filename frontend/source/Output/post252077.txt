OS X El Capitan - Is it possible to disable the switch desktop / switch fullscreen app animation using defaults write? <body> By default, OS X El Capitan uses a swipe animation when switching between desktops or fullscreen apps.  I would like to disable this for the following reasons:  ul liThe switching time between desktops is slow. I would prefer it to be instantaneous./li liThe animation wastes battery life. (Not much, but still some.)/li /ul  I am hoping that this can be done with the codedefaults write/code command. Many other animations can be disabled in this way.  I am aware of the following question, however I do not want to fork out Â£10 for an app just to do such a simple thing. In addition, I am opposed to buying such an app as in my opinion this should be a feature which comes with OS X by default. (On a matter of principe, I refuse to pay for software which essentially fixes a problems with the OS X desktop due to Apple deciding not to included relevant settings in the System Preferences GUI.)
