Problem with reinstalling Facebook app on Iphone 5c <body> I deleted the Facebook app on my phone, however when going into the settings in the iPhone for Facebook it shows that it's still installed. When going to the app store to download Facebook app, it shows the word open but when clicking on it, it doesn't work or when signing out of the appstore, it says update temporarily unavailable to download at this time.  <comment325029> Have you turned your phone on and off?
