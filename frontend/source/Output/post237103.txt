How to turn off Launchpad transparent <body> My MacBook, with Retina Display, has problems with smooth animations. How can I turn off the transparency (and blur) in Launchpad on OS X El Capitan?   Also I'd like to turn off animation when I open folders with apps in Launchpad. Is this possible?  <answer237257> You can enter the following commands in Terminal.app, they will turn off the relevant animations:  precode# showing and hiding Launchpad defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-show-duration -float 0 defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-hide-duration -float 0  # changing pages in Launchpad defaults write com.apple.dock springboard-page-duration -float 0  # restart Dock killall Dock /code/pre  There are quite a few other animations you can turn off as wel. Take a look at this answer or you could use TinkerTool  To turn the animations back on, you enter the same commands, but with code1/code instead of code0/code  <comment290321> It's confusing what you're trying to say. Can you correct your spelling and language and clarify what exactly you're trying to turn off?
