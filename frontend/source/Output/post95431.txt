How do I download links (to PDFs) with one click in Chrome for Mac OS X? <body> Usually when I option-click a single page link, Chrome tries to download the page, but when I option-click on PDFs, Chrome doesn't respond. Is this the default behavior and is there some way to change this? Also do other browsers allow for this type of one-click download? (I know if I turn off in-browser PDF reading that all PDFs would be downloaded, but I don't want that as the default action.)  <answer95435> Go to Chrome settings  Advanced  Click on privacy settings  Content  Scroll down to Plug ins  Click on      Disable Individual plug-ins   Disable the      Chrome PDF Viewer   That will unfortunately disable it for all PDF preview.  But the good news is  now you have the simple one click on a PDF link and it will offer you to download the PDF file.  <comment111934> Let me get that. I just tried in Chrome the Option  Click on a PDF file and it comes up with save as pop up offering to save it as ?? <comment111952> @Buscarì›ƒ: I tried that on several sites, including JSTOR, and it does nothing. Is it because I have Chrome PDF Viewer as well? Why would that disable the option-click? <comment146165> This problem no longer exists as of today's current beta.
