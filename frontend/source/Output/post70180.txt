OSX server 10.6 and umask <body> I'm trying to set up our server so that file permissions make sense. We have a mac mini running OSX 10.6.7. Through our desktop Macs, we connect to shared folders on that server and save files on it, in Finder, TextEdit, etc.  I've set up a umask, as documented here. However, this only works from terminal/finder directly on the server. If I save a file to the server using a connected desktop, it doesn't work.  Any ideas on how I can resolve this?  <answer72170> umask is a stronguser- and process-specific setting/strong and can be overridden. Setting a umask on the server does not affect any clients that accessing the shared folder - each of them will use their own default file creation permissions.  If you want to set default permissions on a shared folder, the answer is to use strongAccess Control Lists/strong (ACLs), which are much more flexible.  ul liHere's a somewhat terse support article from Apple on setting up ACLs in Snow Leopard Server./li liAnd here's a slightly friendlier guide./li /ul
