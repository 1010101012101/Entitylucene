Macbook gets power but does not charge <body> I have a Macbook (Core 2 Duo, 2011 model) which does not charge when I attach my Magsafe charger attached to it. However, it does not discharge as well as apparently it does get power from it. This is indicated by the plug icon in the battery status indicator. What could be the problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/91D3L.png" alt="Battery is not charging while plugged in"  strongUPDATE/strong  I have tried another magsafe charger, and it is charging the Macbook. What could be wrong with the charger?  <comment183298> It could be a issue with the MagSafe cable. Try a magSafe charger from a friend to know if it's a issue with the cable. <comment183299> Was about to add this... Just tried a friend's charger, it works! But, what could be the fault with the cable? <comment183300> The MagSafe charger head could have worn out. I recently replaced mine when I ran it to the same issue which you're now facing. <comment183301> It appears I will have to do the same. Thanks for all the help @JashJacob! <comment183302> I'm guessing you're from India like me, the prices on Flipkart for MagSafe chargers are at a all time low. You should take a look! :) <comment183303> Cool! Will do so.
