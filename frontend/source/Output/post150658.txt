How to restore OS X to out of box / factory experience prior to reselling? <body> I'm ready to resell my Mac, and I'd like to prepare it for the new user, giving them factory-like out of box experience. Even better, I'd like the system to be fully updated, yet come up with no user accounts, starting into the initial setup as if one just unboxed it. Of course performing the updates and software preinstallation requires to set up a temporary user account :(  <answer150659> The instructions below were tested on OS X 10.6 and 10.7.  strongPreflight/strong  ol liBack up any data you wish to retain./li liMake backup copies of iLife applications (iPhoto, GarageBand, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD)./li liDeactivate relevant licensed software such Adobe CS./li liUnregister the machine from your iTunes account./li /ol  strongOS Cleanup/strong  ol liBoot from an external OS X install media, if you wish to completely wipe the hard drive. Boot from the recovery partition (hold ⌘-R on power-up) if you wish to retain the recovery partition as-is./li liIf booting from external media, use the Disk Utility to repartition the hard drive with one partition. strongNote/strong: With SSDs, you ideally should first use a utility that lets you do a secure erase of the medium instead./li liUse the Disk Utility to erase (zero out) the hard drive.

The codefactory/code user should be there. That's the only one we care about. The usernames starting with an underline, those are system accounts that have to be left alone. Same goes for the  daemon, Guest, messagebus, nobody and root accounts.  coderead /Users/factory GeneratedUID/code shows the UID of the user, we'll need it below.  codedelete /Groups/admin GroupMembers &lt;uid&gt;/code, where UID is given above.

If you don't have an SSD, press the "Security Options..." button and choose the single pass option. If you have an SSD, the "Security Options..." button is grayed out, but http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3680 says that "a standard erase makes it difficult to recover data from an SSD"./li liChoose Install OS X./li /ol  See these Apple KB articles:  ul liOS X Mavericks: Erase and reinstall OS X/li liOS X Mountain Lion: Erase and reinstall OS X/li liOS X: How to erase and install/li /ul  I'm not sure if you should erase the whole drive or just the OS X partition. The Apple KB articles tell you to erase the "startup disk", which generally means the OS X partition. If you have other partitions like a Windows partition, you should probably erase the whole drive.  If you erase the whole drive, the recovery partition (which is hidden from Disk Utility) is also erased. If you don't restart, the contents of the recovery partition will stay in memory and you can continue to the step for reinstalling OS X, which will also create a new recovery partition. If you do restart, your Mac can still download the contents of the recovery partition from Apple's servers if it supports Internet Recovery mode.  <comment177564> "you don't need to perform any updates or install any software" Doing precisely the opposite of it is the raison d'etre of the question :) Perhaps I wasn't clear enough. <comment277793> To be clear - the bundled apps of iLife and iWork in a factory build are special. Do you wish to remove them entirely, hack the activation to re-grant those apps to the new user (likely illegal and/or highly difficult) or just have the setup wizard walk the new user through the setup steps as opposed to have a proper "factory" image on the hardware? <comment277925> @bmike "the bundled apps of iLife and iWork in a factory build are special" How? <comment337415> Just what I was looking for. Thanks!
