Get Info of a hidden file (to change its default app) <body> I have a hidden file (.htaccess). When I double click it I would like it to open with a certain app (Sublime Text for this particular file type). In order to set the default app I have to open the "Get Info" window for that file (Cmd+I).  However, that file is hidden. So I can't right button click (two-finger tap) it to select the "Get Info" option from the context dropdown menu.  So the question is stronghow do I open the "Get Info" window for a hidden file?/strong The goal is to be able to change the default app for that file type.  p.s. I do not want to make my hidden files visible. Even temporarily.  <answer136785> "GetFileInfo" is not a separate app, but a process inside the Finder, therefore you cannot use codeopen/code on it. But you could use the following Applescript:  precodetell application "Finder" to activate set thePath to POSIX file "/path/to/file" tell application "Finder" to reveal thePath delay 1 tell application "System Events" to keystroke "i" using command down /code/pre  Now the problem is, that you can not select a file in the Finder that you emcan not see/em, making the whole script solution useless if you "do not want to make my hidden files visible. Even temporarily."  But: if you would specify what exactly you're looking for inside the "Get Info" window (e.g. change permissions, get metadata), chances are there's a command line solution for it that works right away.  strongEDIT:/strong  To open .htaccess or similar dot-files with a specific editor you would have to re-define wich application is the handler for the codetext/plain/code mime type or the codepublic.plain-text/code UTI (for more on the topic of UTIs, see this article for example).   This means that unfortunately .htaccess is viewed the same as .txt by the system and thus both will open with the same editor.  In any case, a comfortable tool to change default file handlers is the preference pane RCDefaultApp which is covered in a lot of questions here on stackexchange.  <answer136869> You can use the following shell function. This uses codeopen information window/code which is much better than GUI scripting or keyboard shortcut scripting which relies on the file shown in Finder.  precodesi() {     osascript - "$@" &lt;&lt;-END &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1     on run args     tell app "Finder"     activate     repeat with f in args     open information window of (posix file (contents of f) as alias)     end     end     end     END } /code/pre  supSource: https://superuser.com/a/509080//sup  Run with  precodesi /path/to/file /code/pre  <answer136870> You could use a separate App for displaying and opening the hidden file like Pathfinder or Forklift or even (Open Source/freeware) FTP apps like Filezilla or Cyberduck.  You can select the File and open up the context menu to open/edit the file with whichever program you want.  <answer136886> strongUnhide hidden files/strong  emThe OP does not want to make hidden files visible, I'll keep my answer for the people who do/em  Use this oneliner to 'un-hide' all hidden files:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder /code/pre  Now you can do a GetFileInfo the way you are used to. kbdCommand/kbdkbdi/kbd, or File - Get Info  Hide the hidden files like this:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder /code/pre  Edit: fixed the missing code;/code sign which resulted in the "Unexpected argument killall; leaving defaults unchanged" error  <comment162388> I get "tell: command not found". So Applescript is no good for me either then. What I'm trying to achieve is change the default app that opens that (and many others) type of file when I click on it. <comment162459> @Geo Applescript is usually executed inside the Applescript editor which resides in `/Application/Utilities/`, not directly on the command line. I've also updated my answer to reflect your question about file handlers. <comment162476> Ah, that's clever! :-) Didn't now about `open information window` before! Even though this won't help in the end with Geo's problem of opening `.htaccess` files in specific editors, have an upvote! <comment162493> *"I do not want to make my hidden files visible. Even temporarily."* <comment162553> the goal of all this is to update my muCommander's (anyone ever used that app?) "Open With.." options. And I don't think it understands Applescript :-( <comment162554> I have Cyberduck. How do I connect to my localhost or select that file? <comment162555> I was going to downvote. But technically this is a solution after all. So let's keep it. <comment162556> @Geo As I said: unless you *want* to open **all** text files with the same editor, it won't work! <comment162557> @GeorgeGarside … but Geo commented on my answer that he basically wants to be able to *click on an invisible file*! How could this be achieved? <comment162559> Please consider editing your question so that it becomes a bit more clear what you want to achieve; as I said below 1) you can only change the default text editor for **all text files**, not just .htaccess, see also [here](http://superuser.com/questions/231854/default-editor-for-files-without-file-name-extension-in-mac-os-x) 2) you can not click on invisible files without making them visible first. Apart from using the command line I'd only suggest using the Open Dialog from whichever Editor and pressing kbdcmd/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd./kbd to make hidden files temporarily visible. <comment162688> sorry, seems i was mistaken. Cyberduck doesn't have a two pane window. Try Filezilla - there you have a split window with one side showing the local directories, the other showing the server side. <comment162741> made the changes. Thank you for the link - installed the app, made the changes, however it didn't affect anything. :-( Good trick with Cmd+Shift+. - but again no help, as context menu is very limited in the "Open" dialog. In particular it doesn't have the "Get Info" option. <comment162746> I don't understand how to write this in terminal. I keep getting the "more" sign, until I ctrl+c out of it. <comment162747> oh, I think it worked out after all! I was able to change ONE .htaccess default app. However, when I click on "Change All" to make all other files of this type to open with the same app - I got "The operation can’t be completed (error code -50)" :-( <comment162749> ALL text files - fine. RCDefaultApp - no help. I changed it, but it seem to have no effect on the double-click behavior. <comment163017> "Unexpected argument killall; leaving defaults unchanged." <comment163018> @Geo, thnx fixed the missing ; <comment163064> works! Unfortunately, when trying to "Change All.." the same error as above "The operation can't be completed (error code -50)" :-( <comment163107> @Geo Error 50 is some kind of read/write error, mostly due to network mounts like SMB. Are you working on your local disk? Do you have sufficient rights to edit the file? <comment163316> @Geo "-50" is usually permissions/accessibility. Do you have write access? <comment163832> that maybe the case.. <comment339689> You may have to remove the whitespace in the second to last line before the `END` if this doesn't work in the terminal, i.e. you keep getting the "more" sign, until you ctrl+c out of it
