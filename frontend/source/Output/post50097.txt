Ipad Log Files - Ipad2 suddenly shut down when watching film on OPlayerHD <body> i have ipad2 32 GB with version of 5.1. when i was watching film with OPlayerHD Lite, suddenly machine has shut down itself and 2 minute later opened itself again. this was happened three times in the same way.   can it write any errors in log files in its filesystem? If it has such a capability, how can i learn what happened to my ipad2 that it closed itself suddenly?  and i wonder if its cache is not enough for playing film on OPlayerHD Settings or lack of hardware on ipad 2?
