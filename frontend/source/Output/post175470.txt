Is safe to turn off iphone for 3 months <body> My phone was taken by my teacher because i play with it while the school time, is it safe to turn it off for 3 months with battery 100% ?  <answer175471> It is recommended that you store you iPhone at roughly 50% charge. If you store it for more then 6 months, then you should charge it back to 50%.
