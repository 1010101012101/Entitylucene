How to install WINE to support multiple users <body> I have installed WINE using the instructions at the WineHQ Wiki and was able to successfully run an install of a Windows application for my admin user.  Buoyed by my success I thought I would try to get it working for the multiple users I have on my machine (read: family).  I found the multiple users stub in the FAQ and have made a number of modifications by following the instructions in the ubuntu forums.  I believe I followed them properly.  It essentially has you set up the sudoers file to support other users having the ability to operate as another user without a password.  In this case I've created a 'windows' user that executes WINE. The issue I'm having is that I'm receiving the following error when attempting to execute an application that previously worked under the admin account.  precode$ sudo -u windows -H wine application.exe shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied job-working-directory: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied Dynamic session lookup supported but failed: launchd did not provide a socket path, verify that org.freedesktop.dbus-session.plist is loaded! err:menubuilder:init_xdg error looking up the desktop directory wine: cannot find L"C:\\windows\\system32\\application.exe" /code/pre  I'm not new to Linux but am new to Mac and to WINE, so thank you for any direction you can provide.    <comment97547> Have all files got permissions to read as the windows user (and the current directory) and the directors between them an / <comment97718> @McArthey have you tried (Wineskin)[http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php].
