Change Appstore user from MacBook? <body> I bought a used MacBook Pro, and I need to update some software.  When I click the 'update all' button to proceed, it asks for the App Store password of the old user's account:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/62wN6.png" alt="App Store screenshot"  How do I remove the old user's account so that I can update my software?  <answer152896> You will need to go to Store-Sign Out, then sign in with your own account.  After that, delete the software that is asking for the old account password, and reinstall it under your account. If the software is not free, you will need to buy the software again.  You do not have a license to use the software, unfortunately.  <answer152897> Since you do not know the previous user Apple ID, unfortunately you will have to start from scratch.  You will have to rebuild your computer OS and all Apple applications under your user ID in order to keep it up to date with software updates in the future.  Here are the detailed instructions how to do that.  Changing ownership of a used Mac  I highly recommend the total wipe procedure to remove any possible software remains and modifications from previous user that you do not want.   The Operating Software and many app from Apple are FREE anyway.  <answer220732> Go to System Preferneces Check the box next to Allow user to reset password using Apple ID.  This will let you change the locked Apple ID  <answer255830> To switch Appstore user you can go to 'Featured' tab -- there link named as "Welcome " is clickable and open the window with the button "Log out".  <comment180049> And please don't expose the AppleID of the guy who sold you the computer. <comment287119> How do we identify which software were installed by old account.? <comment318792> @Fralec My answer is different. I don't know what is the "Store" he's is saying about. <comment355480> This is happening for me with all the software that came preinstalled on my mac. Is there a way to switch the account for that stuff too? Most pre-installed applications will not let me uninstall them... i.e. Keynote, Numbers, Pages, iMovieâ€¦
