Monitoring power consumption on Mac <body> The Android OS monitors the strongpower consumption of running apps and hardware/strong (display). As you may guess, this is a useful feature as it allows to track down energy greedy apps.  strongIs there an application that would do such monitoring on Mac OS?/strong  It should calculate the percentages of the charge that an application/process/hardware has used.  I use plenty of little software that runs in the background permanently. It would be nice to know if such little helpers drain the battery significantly.  <answer35432> h2iStat Menus/h2  let's you monitor your current computer power usage. Unfortunately, it does not break it down by app.  <answer110672> As of Mavericks, this is provided by the OS. Activity monitor has a tab devoted to displaying the energy use of running (and recently running) apps.  Also, the battery icon shows applications that use significant energy on Mavericks and newer.  <comment40380> I know - as you said this is not sufficient. It is also proprietary. That's why I'm using the iStat Pro widget. <comment130345> The Battery menu extra in Mavericks will also display the apps using the most energy.
