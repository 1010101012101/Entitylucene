Unable to boot from bootcamp partition <body> I have Boot Camp loaded on MacBook Pro9,1 with OS X El Capitan 10.11.4, running Windows 10. Unfortunately, for some reason I have NOT been able to upgrade my version of Boot Camp from version 4.   Yesterday I tried to decrease the size of the OS X partition, successfully creating another partition. Unfortunately, the Boot Camp partition is now not recognized as bootable. I am able to see the files in the Boot Camp partition using OS X. How can I make the Boot Camp partition bootable again?  <comment335301> We cannot see over your shoulder to know what you have done. You need to explain in complete detail. <comment335371> I have now provided a more detailed explanation. Thanks. <comment335457> OK, my down-vote retracted. You unfortunately broke the golden rule - don't resize bootcamp. There are a couple of guys on here who are miracle-workers on this stuff, though. Let's see if they find this & can help. Be prepared to post lots of extra info from Terminal when they ask. BTW, you ought to be able to get BC 6 onto that machine, Win10 is not supported below that. <comment335509> Thanks Tetsujn. I'm hoping someone can help. Regarding BC6, the only way I could install BC6 would be to do a clean install. In the meantime, BC4 works with Win10, although certain features do not (e.g., keyboard function keys).
