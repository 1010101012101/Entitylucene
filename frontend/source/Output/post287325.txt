Hide Finder From Dock in Sierra <body> I have seen this instruction for hiding the Finder icon from MacOS:  https://github.com/jesscXC/hide-finder-trash-dock-icons  However, it doesn't seem to work on MacOS Sierra because the codeDockMenus.plist/code file seems to be locked and cannot be changed. Is there any other way to do this on Sierra?  <answer287340> I found the answer while playing with Path Finder's preferences and finding this option: "Enable Finder's "Remove from Dock" menu option. Upon clicking on it, I got the following message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OnfAA.png" alt="enter image description here"  To disable SIP, however, you have to enter recovery mode.
