How do I close the source of an AppleScript application? <body> When saving an AppleScript as an application, you can view the source by looking in the package contents. Recently, ruddfawcett posted his AD search application he made with AppleScript and the source was closed. How do I do this?  <answer50096> In the strongSave As/strong dialog, there's a box that says "Run only". Check that when you save.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqGQv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment57418> Be sure to save a copy of your source code when making a Run Only App. It's annoying to have to write a new script from scratch just because you want to make a tiny change to something that only exists as run only. The process *is* one way. <comment57462> Thanks Daniel! Now that you posted that, I remember doing it before :-) Thanks so much!
