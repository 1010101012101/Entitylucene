WIFI constantly disconnects when watching online stream video on my mbp <body> My mac is Macbook Pro (mid2014), OSX 10.11.3 (15D21). It disconnects literally every one minutes when I am watching stream on douyutv.com (Chinese version of  Twitch). My other devices(smartphone, pad, pc) works all right. I did an experience that watch stream on all my devices, only mac disconnected.  Is it a bug or just something wrong with my configuration?  <answer229008> Try this quick-n-dirty solution.  h2Reset the WiFi/h2  ol liFrom toolbar - codeGo/code - codeGo To Folder/code/li liPaste this Address code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code/li liLocate and delete these files  ul licodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist/code/li licodecom.apple.network.identification.plist/code/li licodecom.apple.wifi.message-tracer.plist/code/li licodeNetworkInterfaces.plist/code/li licodepreferences.plist/code/li /ul/li liRestart your Macbook/li /ol  You can read further for WiFi issues and solutions here  <comment279196> I tried to watch twitch just now, wifi disconnected as well. <comment279417> Thanks for your reply! I just tried all solutions on that webpage. Don't work. This issue only happens when I watching stream. Surfing web, playing online games are not affected. <comment279953> Could you check your logs? Ie start the "Console.app", search for "arpt" (airport) and see if you see something.
