iPhoto '11 is really slow to launch <body> Ever since updating to iPhoto '11 it has become incredibly slow to launch. Using it is acceptable performance wise, but launching is terribly slow. I just closed it and reopened it to get an accurate time, and it too 3 and a half minutes! BTW, it only does the bouncy thing for a minute, then it just sits there. At first I ended up launching it multiple times because I thought it wasn't opening.  It is a 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Mac Book Pro with 5 GB of RAM.  Everything else launches in an acceptable amount of time. Even iMovie is much faster. I have a fairly large library (75 GB), but it isn't any larger than it was before.  I've emptied the iPhoto Trash. Anything else I can do to speed it up, specifically launching?  <answer13511> Try rebuilding the library.  ol liQuit iPhoto/li liBackup your iPhoto library/li liWhile holding kbdCmd âŒ˜/kbd+kbdOption/kbd, relaunch iPhoto/li liSelect the options to rebuild everything/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n6QpJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment14326> Oh yeah, I remember seeing this before. I'll back things up try that. <comment14462> Interesting thing is after I ran time machine to create a full backup iPhoto is now fast again. Totally bizarre.
