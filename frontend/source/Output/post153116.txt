App Store Price Tracking Site <body> Is there a site that tracks App Store price drops and emails you accordingly?   I've had an AppShopper account for years, but over the last few months it hasn't been emailing me about price drops in my wish list. For example, The Room Two dropped to 99 cents and Fantastical 2 for iPad dropped to $7.99 but I didn't receive email notifications.  Is there another site that provides App Store price tracking and notifications?  <answer153123> Appsylum can notify you when an app drops in price.  <answer153154> I rely on the AppZapp app, which lets you create custom price watches and receive notification via email or iOS. You can also browse lists of apps on sale or newly free, as well as those with new updates.  <answer224119> On AppSurprise we track App Store price drops and offer email notifications for registered users - seems like that's just what you are looking for.  We keep a close eye on app prices, with continuous updates throughout the day. To use the wishlist feature, you'll have to register an account. Signing-up is totally free and you have full control of whether you'd like us to send you email notifications for price drops on your wishlist or not (profile settings).  <comment271782> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's about shopping.
