How to change TextEdit keyboard shortcuts? <body> I would like to change TextEdit shortcuts which are visible in the menu, but are not listed in Keyboard shortcuts in System preferences. I tried adding new shortcut, assigned to TextEdit, but it doesn't work for some reason... This is what I want to have:  Jump to Selection  -  ⌥ Space  Select Line        -  ⌘ J  <answer86376> Not sure how the first one should work, but I was able to assign both custom shortcuts using this:  ol liNavigate to System Preferences-Keyboard-Keyboard Shortcuts/li liClick "+" button/li liSelect TextEdit as an application/li liEnter "Jump to Selection" or "Select Line…" (note that there is special … symbol used, not three periods, you can just copy and paste it from here I believe) as a menu title/li liPress shortcut you'd like to use/li liTest it and enjoy!/li /ol  Hope this helps.  <comment99759> Yes, I tried the same, but unfortunately, for me just doesn't work. Maybe because of overlap... <comment99766> Do you see the shortcuts listed next to corresponding menus? It works for me for "Jump to line" and as I noted above: not sure how "Jump to selection" works. I cannot upload images yet, so have to describe in text. <comment99926> Npb, I understand you. Jump to selection actually jumps to your cursor position, without making any changes. It's very useful when you loose track of the cursor. I see only original shortcuts, not mine. However, mine are listed in system preferences. I inserted them,, just like you described. I would prefer to get into some system file and modify it directly. To see and remove original shortcuts...
