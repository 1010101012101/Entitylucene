How to find the file address location for a file found in Spotlight <body> The Spotlight application handily locates files for opening immediately. However, I want to know the found file's address from Spotlight in order to navigate to that location in Finder and move the file elsewhere.   In this specific example, I'm trying to find a code.tex/code file to move to a more memorable location, but I don't remember where it is. Is there a way to find out the exact address location of the found file through Spotlight?  <answer177357> From Spotlight:  codeShow All in Finder/code - codectrl+click/code the file - codeShow in Enclosing Folder/code or select codeGet Info/code. Now you are at the file's location or have the files address (from codeGet Info/code) without opening the file.  UPDATE: OS X Yosemite changed Spotlight quite a bit. Now the the file location is displayed in the lower right corner of Spotlight and codecmd+enter/code will open a finder tab with the searched file at the file's address.
