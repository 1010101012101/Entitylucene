Group Settings in Mavericks Profile Manager <body> I have successfully setup my Mavericks server with Profile Manager. I have enrolled my devices and all is working fine.  (For example) I have a group with 40 users in it. I want to apply Calendar (CalDAV) settings to that group. It asks me to enter the username and password for the user. It's a group....  Is there a way to add the settings as a "template" and the user only has to add there username and password? I assumed that when the user enrols the device, they have to authenticate to the /mydevices page, so it already has the users credentials?  Am I missing something?  <answer145617> Yes there are variables you can enter for common user fields  http://krypted.com/mac-security/using-payload-variables-in-profile-manager/
