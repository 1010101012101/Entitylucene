How to animate different objects at sametime? <body> I think this is very basic question but I could not find solution online. I have codekeynote 7.0/code on codeOS X EL Capitan 10.11.16/code.br The problem is I have 3 objects and I want them to disappear at the same time. I tried to select all of them and put codeBuild out/code animation on it but the objects go 1 by 1. And if I try to change one of the objects order to code1/code another changes to that objects value. I was thinking i could put all of them to code1/code but not possible.  I am very lost over this right now.   <comment318811> Did you try making them into a group, and then assigning the action to the group rather than to individual objects? <comment318996> yeah i did that. but if i want to for example, make one disappear and another appear at the same time. that is also not possible.
