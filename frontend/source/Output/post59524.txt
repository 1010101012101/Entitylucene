Desktop image is not showing in Mountain Lion with dual monitor <body> I have a MBA connecting via HDMI to Samsung Monitor. Problem is desktop background for Samsung monitor is not showing. There is only grey desktop and doesn't have any changes even I try to change the image of the desktop at System Preferences. Changes for the MBA desktop is ok. Is that a mountain lion bug?  <answer59533> OS X allows you to select different images for each display. When you open the strongDesktop/strong section in emDesktop &amp; Screen Saver/em Preferences, you should get one dialog on each screen for choosing a desktop image. strongEach dialog controls only the image for that screen, so make sure you're setting the image you want on both screens./strong  <answer61029> Restarting the Dock seems to work for me, however I don't know what is causing this grey desktop background.  To restart the Dock, type this into Terminal and press enter:  precodekillall Dock /code/pre  <answer61034> I also experienced this problem and found this workaround:  ul liOpen System Preferences - Displays - Arrangements/li liswitch on "Mirror Displays" and switch it off again/li /ul  This is no solution for the problem of course, but at least the wallpaper is showing again without rebooting...  <comment68564> I have a somewhat similar setup (MBP and LG external) and haven't seen this problem when switching to Mountain Lion.  When you go to the "Desktop & Screen Saver" preferences, does it show you two dialogs...one for the main screen and one for the "Secondary Desktop"? <comment68569> Grey screen...are you sure you're not running an app in full screen mode? <comment83245> This setting doesn't seem to save if I disconnect and reconnect the second screen (like when I leave from work and take the laptop home but plug it back in tomorrow). <comment84410> This fixed it for me. Thanks. Pretty strange Mountain Lion bug. <comment90054> Worked instantly, great tip. Have been wondering about this for months.
