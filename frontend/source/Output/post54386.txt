Word stop when navigating text with option-key <body> I use option and command to navigate text (which is awesome). I've read somewhere that you can specify the characters that constitute a word stop (underscores for example). However I can't find this anywhere.   Does anyone know where to set this?  <answer54393> You can choose between a few settings in System Preferences, but I don't know any way to customize them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/inJgW.png" alt=""  The standard setting treats period and colon as part of (some) words.  ASCII special characters that are part of words:  ul licode'.:_/code in Standard/li licode'_/code in English (United States, Computer)/li /ul  ASCII special characters that are not part of the start or end of words:  ul licode$+&lt;=&gt;^`/code in Standard/li licode$+&lt;=&gt;^`/code in English (United States, Computer)/li /ul  codeaa.11/code and codeaa'11/code are never single words. code11.11/code and codeaa_11/code are always single words.
