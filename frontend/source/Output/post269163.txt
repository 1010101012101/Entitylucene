iPhone showing shared calendars, but not showing on icloud.com <body> I'm having trouble finding help with this. There's plenty of help for calendars that aren't showing on the iPhone, but are showing on icloud.com. My problem is the reverse of this.  I have 3 calendars that were shared with me recently that all show up on my iPhone and iPad. When I login to icloud.com, none of those calendars show, even though there are other calendars that are shared with me that do show.  Any ideas?  <comment338105> I'm definitely using the same apple id!! <comment338132> Are these missing calendars shared from icloud or are they from some other provider like Google? If they are actually Google calendars they are probably set up on all your devices because of shared settings through iCloud keychain, but that doesn't get Apple's iCloud website to subscribe to the Google calendar.
