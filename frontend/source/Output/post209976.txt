Automatic lock screen does not work in EL Capitan <body> I have my preferences set so the screen locks 1 minute after sleep or after the screensaver goes up.  This used to work until I upgraded to El Cap.  Now no matter how long after the screensaver has gone up I never get asked my password, the lock screen just does not happen.  Any idea why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvKp7.png" alt="Screen Lock preferences"  <answer211792> I can report the problem seems to have resolved 'naturally' after a reboot.  It is unclear why though.  <comment347655> Same problem in Yosemite.  Same resolution (rebooting).
