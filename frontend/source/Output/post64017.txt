iPhone calendar/todo list app with easily enterable and snoozable reminders? <body> There are a lot of reminder/calendar/todo list apps, and it's hard to make sense of all of them.  Hoping someone can recommend one that meets the following criteria:  ol liReminders are as easy to enter as possible.  Ideally one screen where I type a quick description, and enter the date and time that I want the alert./li liReminders must be easily snoozable, strongfor an arbitrary (or near arbitrary) amount of time/strong.   By this I mean:  The phone vibrates and the reminder pops up.  I then have the option to dismiss the reminder, or to snooze it, and (extremely important) I can choose (right there, not just a default setting within the app) how long to snooze it for.  I should be able to either type in a number of minutes to snooze it for, or select from a list (e.g. 10/20/30/40/50/60 minutes, etc.)/li /ol  Big bonus points if I can enter reminders via the web and have them automatically synced to the phone.  Nice to have:  Daily view (i.e. show all reminders for a given day)  Does something like this exist?    <comment74074> Not sure it satisfies all of your requirements, but how about [Due](http://www.dueapp.com/)? It also says there are some [snooze interval limitations](http://www.dueapp.com/faq.html#snoozelimitations) <comment74089> Thanks - it looks nice, but those snooze limitations are a deal-breaker unfortunately.  And wait, an app can only display 64 notifications?  (Per what, exactly?)  Guess I may not be getting an iPhone after all, since this is close to the #1 thing I want a smartphone for...
