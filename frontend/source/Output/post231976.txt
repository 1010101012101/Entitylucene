Custom app not recognised as a browser anymore on El Capitan <body> I used to have a custom app I created based on this GitHub project, which I used to pick different Fluid apps when clicking a link anywhere, based on its URL.  The app is a very simple script that looks like this:  precodeon open location this_URL     if this_URL contains "atlassian.net" then         tell application "/Applications/Jira.app"             activate             open location this_URL         end tell     else if this_URL contains "gitlab.hq.jadu.net" then         tell application "/Applications/GitLab.app"             activate             open location this_URL         end tell     else         tell application "/Applications/Google Chrome.app"             activate             open location this_URL         end tell     end if end open location /code/pre  I remember I had to set this app as my default browser, and it'd do the trick...  However, I tried to use it again now I updated to El Capitan (latest version 10.11.4) and it won't allow me to select this app as my default browser anymore - when I go to codePreferences &gt; General/code, my app is just not in the list to pick...  Do you have any clue why this can be happening? Is it a simple fix or has the way El Capitan works changed a lot?
