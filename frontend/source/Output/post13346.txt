'Travelling Salesman Problem' solver app for iPhone <body> Is there iPhone App to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) for real world addresses?   I found solver for OSM data?  But I can not find in repo sources for iPhone.  <answer21171> Nothing is remotely close. I'd watch the Wolfram Alpha app as they'd be my obvious choice for someone that would enable a "mail the data" to their servers for a solution.  iOS is certainly powerful enough to solve this class of problems, but we're still waiting for someone to invest the time in releasing an "app for that".   <comment14079> [TSP Solver for OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman) says that IPhone is supported platform. There is [online solver using Google Maps](http://www.josef-graef.de/karten/tsp/index.html) <comment23122> You might get a response to this if you post to cs-theory on stack exchange. http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/ <comment70279> How would this work in practice as opposed to a theoretical exercise? Real world addresses means tight integration to an up-to date road map database which means that you will need to restrict your area from the globe to an area where this data is available. I see this as a nice armchair exercise, but fail to see what problem you are facing today and how this can be answered in its current form.
