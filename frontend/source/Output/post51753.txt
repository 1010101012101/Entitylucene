When online my webpage becomes unresponsive on my macbook-pro osx? <body> When online my webpage becomes unresponsive, particularly when I click on a link, is there a fix? I have a MacBook-Pro osx 10.7.4 about a year old.  This is not a new problem and I have been blaming it on my router but the signal is strong and disconnecting from wi-fi and then reconnecting seems to get things going again. It happens intermittently and I can't figure out what is causing it.  Thanks for any help  <answer51768> This is mostly related to DNS problems. Can you check in your terminal if the following commands produce immediately a response? You can also check this with some other hostnames, because the responses may be cached on your local machine.  precodenslookup www.apple.com nslookup apple.stackexchange.com /code/pre  Is the DNS server in your network settings set correctly?  <answer52036> Which browser are you using?  I was experiencing the same issue on Chrome, all I did was   ul liGo into Chrome - Preferences/li liGo to advanced settings/li liUn-tick the box "Predict network actions to improve page load performance"/li liRestarted Chrome/li /ul  Then it worked fine
