iTunes 11 and original Apple TV - TV Shows <body> Having updated to iTunes 11; when I try to synch TV show to ATV the left hand list will not scroll down below the 'F' category? It works perfectly on Movies, Podcasts, Music and Photos. However, on those the 'All' and 'last 5' etc selection of categories does not work as a filter any more and all available media is shown - which isn't a problem. It appears Apple are slowly forgetting the original ATV, I guess it is understandable as it is getting on now.
