Where are ethernet/internet/networking configuration files/settings stored on OS X 10.6 <body> Someone I know has an ethernet configuration profile that works on the university network I'm on. As I am on 10.8 I do not have the option of configuring these files so I'd like to copy his Configuration Profile.  Where are these located on OS X 10.6?  Ps. I'm using a Macbook Air with a USB ethernet plug if that matters.  Psps. I know one can create profiles with the ipcu, but I haven't been able to make one that works for ethernet unfortunately.  <answer101696> Try code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/code
