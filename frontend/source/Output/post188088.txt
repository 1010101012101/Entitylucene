Where is the file .vimrc in macOS? (Downloaded Macvim through Homebrew) <body> I have Yosemite 10.10.3 and I recently downloaded macvim using homebrew. I find a vimrc file under the directory:     /usr/share/vim   However, after putting some modification like setting the background theme to dark, nothing changed when I opened macvim. Am I doing something wrong? Is it the wrong vimrc file? Does it mean the vimrc file is in a different directory if it was downloaded from homebrew?  <answer188090> If you use vim before the installation, the file code.vimrc/code should be on your code$HOME/code directory (code/Users/your-username/.vimrc/code). Macvim will use that file if exists.  <comment222516> I checked this directory and the file doesn't exist. Does it mean I have to create one? <comment222517> Yes, you should create it to customize it only for your user. <comment222535> Run `which vim` to see which `vim` installation you are running. Aint 'vim' installed by default? <comment222536> I upgraded it with homebrew. <comment222541> But that does not by definition replace the previous version. Homebrew installes in /usr/local/bin and (no mac here) to my knowledge vim is installed in /usr/bin. It also depends on your path. Just run which vim once. <comment222544> Yes the previous one is not replaced, but after I put the command: brew install vim, and when I put vim in terminal it shows the version is 7.4.712 instead of 7.3 which is shipped with the system.
