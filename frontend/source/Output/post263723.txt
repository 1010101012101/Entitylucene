OSX ownership options for PowerPC iMac <body> I was given a iMacG4 (PowerPC)  and intend to give to an 8 year old for the purpose of web browsing and exploring python.  I would like to gain administrative (sudo) privilege.    Although I have access as a common user, I do not have the password, which means no sudo privilege.  I also do not have the original CDs.  Does it make sense to reset the box to factory settings or is there a better technique to gain sudo ability?  Considering its age is the factory reset procedure different from modern Macs?  I did find this crudely written procedure from the youTube factory reset procedure:  ol liRestart or Turn On Your iMac G4 or G5 Computer/li liPress kbdCmd-S/kbd at the same time when you see a black screen./li liRoot # should come up/li liWhen you see the root # type codemount -uw //code and press kbdReturn/kbd/li liType coderm /DB/.applesetupdone/code followed by kbdReturn/kbd/li liYour screen will come up with all these white words going down which is normal/li liIt will shutdown, Turn ON your iMac G4 or G5 Computer/li liIt will take a while to load up, then it should load a quick video starting with a apple logo./li /ol  I could not confirm if step 4 was performed correctly and  Step 5 did not work because it was read only.  <comment330450> Do you have access to the DVDs with the OS which came with the hardware? Can you currently log in as a user but not as an administrator? <comment330489> Good questions: I do not have the original CDs and yes: the machine automatically logs in as user.  I do not have the user password and therefore no sudo privilege. <comment330493> I've fixed the commands. Also there seems to be something missing between 5 and 6, probably `shutdown -r -t now Bye`. <comment330496> I still have a PPC OS X CD around here somewhere...if you need an image, let me know. <comment330593> @patrix: thanks for updating the procedure <comment330594> @Allan: Yes please: how can I download it? <comment330625> Which OSX version do you need? <comment330661> Download it from here [OX X 10.5 Snow Leopard](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AmW50NkbWLGikphH9nt0sH2KSk7VdA)
