How to hide Dock on non-fullscreen desktop <body> I want to hide Dock on non-full desktops. It takes a lot of space so some applications are hard to use in such small amount of space, but on the other hand I don't want to keep each single application on its own desktop, because of logical grouping.  So is there any way to hide dock and make program take extra space used by Dock. like on the full-screen desktop but keeping multiple applications.   I would be grateful for any help. Thx.  <answer260045> You can hide/show the strongDock/strong by pressing kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdD/kbd which checks/un-checks the strongAutomatically hide and show the Dock/strong checkbox under strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongDock/strong, and then application windows can occupy the space normally used by the strongDock/strong.  When hidden, you can have the strongDock/strong temporarily reappear by moving the mouse to the bottom of the screen (emthat's assuming you have it in its default location/em).   <comment325464> Thx, I missed this option.
