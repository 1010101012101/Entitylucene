Restoring from Time Machine (Mavericks) from a Snow Leopard install disk <body> My primary hard drive died recently and I had to replace it. I'm using an Early 2009 24" iMac with 4 GB of RAM. The original drive was a 1TB and I replaced it with a 2 TB disk. I have several Time Machine backups on an external drive. Because this is a new drive, there's no recovery partition. So, I'm trying to use my Snow Leopard installation media to restore from Time Machine. The process will get to about 2% when it will fail with the following error messages: OSInstaller[145]: [RESTORE] Error -36 while restoring /path.  I haven't found much on this error. Could this error be occurring because I'm trying to restore a newer OS using an older version of Time Machine?  If so, does anyone know of a way to create a boot CD or image from a Windows computer because that's the only other machine I have access to.  <comment192667> I'd be inclined to get an OS on there, then update to the same as you last had on it [hoping your Apple ID was used to 'purchase' anything older than Yosemite or you won't be able to get hold of it easily] *Then* deal with the Time Machine restore <comment192668> I was considering that, too, but wasn't sure how that would go since TM will erase the drive, but I think I like that idea best. <comment192669> It just feels like the safest option, though of course, not the quickest. Leave the TM disconnected until you're ready for it.
