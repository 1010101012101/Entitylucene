Burn Movie to DVD on a Mac <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   How can I convert MKV files and burn them to DVD?       Does anybody know a good program for Mac that can burn a .avi or .mkv movie file to a DVD to play on any regular DVD player? I am looking for something like ConvertXtoDVD for Windows.  <answer38358> Sounds like you need Toast Titanium. Toast will take individual video files and put them into a DVD player compatible format. It doesn't have many options for the DVD's menus, but it's a quick and easy way to burn video files to DVD. It supports both AVIs and MKVs.  <comment43435> @Jaspack No problem!
