iTunes Match Songs Don't Appear on iPhone <body> My iPhone 5S says it has synced with iTunes Match but some music is missing from the iPhone.  I have Show All Music turned on.  Is there some way to debug what is happening?  <answer126378> Probably these missing songs weren't correctly uploaded from iTunes to cloud. Try re-scan you iTunes library and re-uploading it. Tell me how it goes, I'm having a lot of issues with iTunes Match.   <answer226652> Just to make sure you have all the strongnecessary settings/strong turned on, make sure you have:  ol liThe latest version of iOS/li liNavigate to codeSettings &gt; Music &gt; iCloud Music Library/code and turn it on;/li /ol  Also, make sure you are connected to a WiFi network (emthe default behaviour of Music app is to only allow music downloads through WiFi/em). If you don't have a WiFI connection, enable Data Downloads navigating to codeSettings &gt; Music &gt; Use Mobile Data/code and turn it on.  <comment148184> Are they grayed out or completely gone? <comment148199> Example:  I have the AC/DC album "Who Made Who" on my MBP.  I ripped it from the actual CD.  iTunes on the MBP says the album is "Uploaded", but it doesn't download to the library on my iPhone.  It's not that I can see it on my phone but it's grayed out...it's just not there.
