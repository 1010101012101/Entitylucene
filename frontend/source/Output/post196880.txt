Can't find MIT/GNU Scheme in Applications after install <body> I installed program called "MIT/GNU Scheme" to /Applications. I can run it via Spotlight, but it says it's from unidentified developer. So I should find it in the folder and right click open, but it's not in the folder. Terminal autocomplete cannot find it either. If I install it again, it says it is there and asks whether to replace the old file. Read somewhere it might be 32bit version on my 64bit system, but I specifically installed 64bit version. I am running OS X 10.10.4  <answer196891> Alternatively, you can also visit the emSecurity &amp; Privacy/em panel in emSystem Preferences/em right after trying to run the program from Spotlight. The panel should have an option to run (the last tried) program from an unidentified developer.  <answer196953> You can confirm where it was installed in code/Applications/code by using Terminal.app:  precodecd /Applications ls -lt | grep -i cheme /code/pre  This should print the name of the directory where it was installed (which should be emMIT:GNU Scheme/em). You can access it from the command-line by adding the following directory to your codePATH/code: code/Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/code.  <comment235274> Where did you get it from? <comment235366> http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme  md5 is correct <comment235368> Yes that allows me to run the file, thank you. I'm still unable to run it from console, delete and link it, though. (Sorry if I wasn't clear in the original question) <comment235374> @rdkn - you do not mention anything about console in your question - you need to edit that. Also you can't run anything from OSX's console which is a viewer of log files. Perhaps you mean Terminal? <comment235375> @Mark: yes I meant Terminal, sorry <comment235386> Is there anything beginning MIT in your /Applications folder - The documentation is appalling for OS X and should be reported as a major bug. This question on SO suggesting macports or homebrew which is usually the best way for a command line Unix program where the developers don't seem to know OS X <comment235453> How did you install it? When I download the dmg and drag and drop the application to the `/Application` folder, I can see it in Finder, `ls /Applications` lists it, and I can run it from command line with `/Applications/MIT\:GNU\ Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/mit-scheme`. <comment235563> thank you, my problem somehow went away, not sure if it was because of your advice, but I can see the app now, so I'm closing the question
