Unable to enable PHP in OSX 10.8 mountain lion <body> I have enabled php according to PHP's instructions and uncommented,  precode#LoadModule php5_module libexec/httpd/libphp5.so /code/pre  in em/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf/em. However the line,  precode#AddModule mod_php5.c /code/pre  does not exist in that file, nor do any #AddModule lines.  This may be the root of my problem but regardless I restarted apache with,  precodesudo apachectl restart /code/pre  and attempted to open ~/Site/page.php  precode&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;My First PHP page &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?php echo "&lt;h1&gt; Hello World! &lt;/h1&gt;";?&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  in multiple web browsers.  Safari and Chromium just gave me the raw text of the file and Opera gave me   precodeHello World ";?&gt; /code/pre  Do I need to configure apache to add that module and how do I do that, or is there some other problem?  PS, I couldn't even open page.php with safari when it was in my home directory and other browsers tried to download it.   <answer91934> If the line doesn't exist commented-out, then just add it separately. emi.e./em put a line in  codehttpd.conf/code that reads codeAddModule mod_php5.c/code.  <comment107991> Attempted that, doesn't work http://pastebin.com/5F2fnxKk <comment107992> Attempted that, doesn't work, I suspect `mod_php5.c` doesn't exist.  So I used `find /usr -name "mod_php5.c -print` which returned null. `cat /var/log/apache2/error_log` for more details [link](http://pastebin.com/5F2fnxKk)
