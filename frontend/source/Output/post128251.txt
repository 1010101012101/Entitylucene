"Show In-App Purchases" Not Showing In App Store <body> I have an app on the App Store that has In-App Purchases, but on the store there isn't a button that says "In-App Purchases" where a user can see what the IAP are.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lDAWR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Where on mine (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/uidesign-draw-your-concept/id725323019?mt=8) says it Offers IAP but there isn't a button at the bottom that shows what the IAP are.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H7Yr1.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How do I make it available for users to see what IAP i have in my app.  <answer144919> It is now showing my In-App Purchases on the App Store.br It just takes a couple days or so to appear on the App Store.  <answer236000> I was having same problem for my new app - submitted a question to apple support - they replied:     The In-App Purchases section of your app’s product page will contain   the top In-App Purchases for the app only after a minimum purchase   requisite has been reached. If the number of completed In-App   Purchases doesn’t exceed the minimum threshold, this area will not   appear.   <comment169990> Hey @DocAsh59 I see you got this working for your app. Any chance you could update this question with an answer telling us how you got it working? :) <comment170713> @AlistairMcMillan Hello, I do not know, I think it may of taken a bit of time to appear on the App Store. As when I posted this question it was about a day or so it was accepted onto the App Store. So I think just wait a bit :) <comment288703> That really good to know. Thanks for your answer!
