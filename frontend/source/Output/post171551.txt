Prevent non-jailbroken iOS device from sleeping when plugged in to charger <body> I have a non-jailbroken iPhone running iOS 8.  I'd like to automatically have the device never auto-lock / sleep when it is plugged into power, but auto-lock after a set idle interval when not plugged in.  Is there a way to do this without jailbreaking the device?  <comment201831> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/119709/prevent-ios-device-from-sleeping-if-plugged-to-charger <comment201832> @Buscarì›ƒ Thanks for the link! That question is specifically asking about jailbroken devices, though. I'm interested in a non-jailbreak solution.
