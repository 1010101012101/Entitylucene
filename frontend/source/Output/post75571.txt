The history is shared between my iTerm2 terminal tabs: how can I switch that off? <body> I am using iTerm2 (with zsh), and for some reason the history is shared between the different tabs and windows that are open. In most of the cases for me, this is annoying, since I have tabs per specific task, and if I have to redo some commands, I just want to be able to go back (up) in history to retrieve the last action for emthat/em window/tab only.  I have no idea how to disable this shared history, I read somewhere that you can emenable/em shared history in codezsh/code, but afaik I have done no such thing.  Can anybody point me in the right direction?  <answer75572> Executing the following should do the trick (use codesetopt/code to reenable them):  precodeunsetopt inc_append_history unsetopt share_history /code/pre  <comment87740> Do I add these to my `.zshrc`? <comment91966> and with bash??? <comment198600> @nathanvda yep, you add this to `.zshrc`. <comment303277> What about bash shell? <comment308732> @Adi you can either add it to your `.bashrc` or your `.bash_profile`. <comment321940> I am getting `-bash: unsetopt: command not found`. Is it possible that this is something tmux related? Afaik I am not using tmux, but I am still experiencing the same problem as OP <comment350074> The question and this answer are specific to `zsh`.  I don't think there is an equivalent fix for Bash.
