The C key stopped working, any workaround to emulate 'Command + C'? <body> On a macbook, the strongcodeC/code/strong key isn't working anymore, so i was wondering if there was a way to trigger the strongcodecommand + c/code/strong shortcut other than pressing the strongcodecommand/code/strong and strongcodeC/code/strong keys  Thanks a lot  <answer124207> Yes, you can use the Edit menu and select copy   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ANsic.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124210> This page tells you how to pick a different keyboard shortcut for Copy: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH13911  To address the larger issue of not having a C key anywhere else, you can use the Keyboard Viewer (search for it in Finder Help) to press any key that's malfunctioning when an external keyboard isn't convenient or at hand. Adding c to the special characters window might also work better for some than summoning the keyboard viewer.  <answer124234> I believe the solution Apple recommends is to buy a new MacBook.  <answer124235> strongQuick and easy:/strong  Use codeRight-Click/code, or the trackpad codetwo-finger-click/code gesture, or the codeControl+Click/code keyboard shortcut (all of which do the same thing effectively) to invoke a context menu on whatever you have selected, and you can choose Copy from the context menu.  strongAlso quick and easy:/strong  Invoke the Edit menu from the keyboard and select Copy from there, as Maximus has proposed. Or go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts/code to create a new shortcut for Copy, as Nik M has helpfully proposed.  strongNeither quick nor easy:/strong  If you enjoy Rube Goldbergian solutions, you will emlove/em this:  Change your keyboard layout to Dvorak. codeSystem Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Input Sources/code. If you tick "Show input menu in menu bar" you can even get a lovely drop-down menu in the menu bar for fast switching between layouts. You can use standard QWERTY most of the time and switch to Dvorak when you need the C key.  But why switch back and forth? Just commit, and learn Dvorak for all your typing needs!  Dvorak puts the C on a key you haven't broken yet, and moves the&mdash;well, that letter after I and before K, you know the one&mdash;to where the C used to be.  And really, who emever/em uses that letter? You'll be totally fine without it.  Sincerely, your friend...  emfacepalm/em onathan  subp.s. I jest. Do the first one. It's what I've always done in a broken-key situation./sub  <comment145220> How do you use a computer without a 'C' key?

What some can't stand, others just roll with. <comment145261> They might even replace the keyboard :-) <comment145263> Hopefully the new computer would have a different keyboard, yes :) <comment145279> @KevinDTimm Copy and paste. With the mouse. :) <comment145363> Not to get too chatty, but at my first job, the terminal I used didn't have an ENTER key.  So, how long do you think it took me to break myself of the habit of pressing CTRL-M? <comment145364> I completely understand the reason, but it's tragic that web pages are so impermanent that we resort to copy-pasting their contents on to other pages. Still, message received.
