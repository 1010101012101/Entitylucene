XCode Keybindings not working with Dvorak <body> I type Programmer's Dvorak. I just started using XCode, and I decided to try to change the keybindings to be more Emacs-like. So, I set the keybinding to "Move Left" to ^B, pressed ^B, and...nothing happened. However, when I switch my keyboard layout back to QWERTY, then everything works. Why are my keybindings not working in Dvorak, and how can I fix this?  <comment251148> This is answered in a stackoverflow post http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19223073/ios-simulator-7-0-typing-dvorak-keyboard-appears-as-qwerty-keys
