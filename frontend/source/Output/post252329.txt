Where is the login guest account? <body> I have a guest staying in my apartment and I would like her to use my iMac as guest. But when she boots it, she sees only the login to my account and cannot find any reference to the guest account.  How does she find the login to the guest account?  (iMac late 2015 OS updated recently)  <answer252332> To set this up you need to activate it.  ol liGo to Apple menu  System Preferences/li liSelect Users &amp; Groups/li liClick the lock icon to unlock it/li liEnter an administrator name and password/li liSelect Guest User in the list of users./li liSelect “Allow guests to log in to this computer.”/li liClick the lock icon to lock it/li liClose the window /li /ol  Hope this helps.  <comment313953> In addition you could add about Parental Controls if required so that the account is misused.
