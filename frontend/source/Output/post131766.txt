Profile Manager backup folder over 25 GB without many devices <body> I just noticed, that my Mavericks OS X Server's Profile Manager backups folder is quite large (25 GB).  precode/Library/Server/ProfileManager/Data/backup /code/pre  I however do not know why. The profile manager of the server manages 4 devices and services like Time Machine are not setup.  <comment154842> The path you originally provided did not exist. I've attempted to fix the path (rm space and add Data) but if that's wrong please re-edit.
