How to prevent cells from breaking across pages in Pages on Mac? <body> This is what I have now:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S0MYE.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would like to avoid breaking orange cell across pages. Is there a way to do this?  <comment248239> Couldn't you just use numbers? <comment248240> No, I need text editor... It must be pages. <comment248280> you can add text boxes to numbers. <comment261233> @IronCraftMan unfortunately same problem exists also in Numbers while printing document.
