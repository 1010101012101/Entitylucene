Fixing a PPD that gives "File has insecure permissions (0100644/uid=501/gid=20)" error <body> I have attached an old printer to my Mac, and I know that the cables and printer and basic CUPS interface are all working because I can print to it from the Terminal. However I would like to be able to print to it from Mac OS applications as well, so it needs a PPD.  I have a generic, text-only ppd, and the OS seems to want it to go in/usr/libexec/cups/filter/  So I put it there. The OS also seems to want it to have a lower case filename and no extension. OK, I did that too. Now it gives me the following error:  precode"File “/usr/libexec/cups/filter/textonly” has insecure permissions (0100644/uid=501/gid=20)." /code/pre  The other files in the directory have the following permissions:  precodesystem: Read &amp; Write (my group): Read only everyone: Read Only /code/pre  This particular file has, by contrast  precodeme: Read &amp; write staff: Read only everyone: Read only /code/pre  I emthink/em the problem is that it wants the file to be owned by system, but I'm not sure, and I don't know how to change ownership to system anyway.  Any counsel? How can I fix this, or is this permissions thing a red herring, and I'm approaching the problem all wrong?
