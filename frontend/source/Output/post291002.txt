How to use the .ipsw file to restore the ipad (disabled as I have forgotten the passcode) <body> I forget a passcode for my iPad mini, wifi. After several unsuccessfull attempts to enter the passcode, it become locked permanently and asked me to connect it to iTunes. Since I hadn't synced it with itunes or use icloud (my ipad is not connected to wifi) So I finally decided to use Recovery mode. I followed the official instructions, entered the recovery mode and began the restore/update process. Unfortunately, to proceed, iTunes have to download 1.5GB file.   If the download takes more than 15 minutes and your device exits recovery mode, let the download finish, then repeat these steps. Indeed, after 15 minutes iPad exits recovery mode and restarts. The download is then stopped.  Well I read the question Restoring of iPad using recovery mode fail due to 15 minutes timeout and it was mentioned in one of the answers to use the .ipwd file. So should I download the latest version file? And how to use that file?  <comment367398> Linked answer updated to cover any device/iOS
