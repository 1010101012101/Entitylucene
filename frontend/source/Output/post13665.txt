Find gateway address and netmask? <body> I come from the land of windows, where the codeipconfig/code command shows four important pieces of information: IP address, netmask, gateway address, and MAC address.  However, on a Mac, codeifconfig/code only shows IP address and MAC address.  Where can I find the gateway address (e.g. 192.168.1.1) and the netmask (e.g. 255.255.255.0)?  <answer13666> On most Unix-like systems, including OSX, that information comes from codenetstat -r/code (coder/code for "route").  <answer13667> With codeifconfig/code on OS X you can find netmask :  precodeinet 192.168.1.2 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.1.255 /code/pre  netmask 0xffffff00 means 255.255.255.0  And for finding gateway address use codearp -a/code or as geekosaur said use codenetstat -nr | grep '^default'/code.
