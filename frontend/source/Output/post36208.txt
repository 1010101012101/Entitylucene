Inflated Music Size on iPhone when Syncing <body> Frequently when I sync my iPhone to my iMac, the size bar will report that the amount of music on my phone is nearly double what it actually is (confirmed with a manual check). The phone will usually report that it is over capacity, but I can still copy applications and more music to it (as I should be able to). This doesn't happen on every sync, and sometimes when the sync is completed, it will shrink back down to the correct size. It's a major annoyance and makes it hard for me to see how much space I actually have used/free on my phone.  <answer36260> I have found that it is related to iTunes Match. If you turn off iTunes Match on the iPhone, the iPhone will no longer register as over capacity.   <answer36288> I had similar problem.   ol liTurn off iTunes Match, and make sure "manually manage music" is checked as an option when connecting the iPhone to your computer./li liRemove all music from phone manually via iTunes./li liEnable iTunes Match again and you should be all set with a cleared device and no more confusion./li /ol  <comment41492> Thanks for the response. This problem was occurring before iTunes Match was released though. And I do currently have iTunes Match switched off. <comment41493> Thanks for the response.
