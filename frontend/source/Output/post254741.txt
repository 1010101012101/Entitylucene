Mouse-1 not setting point in Emacs 25.1 <body> I am trying to move to the OS X terminal from Ubuntu so I am new to this and might be doing something daft, but the problem is dead simple: I cannot set the point with the mouse in emacs 25.1.  OS is Yosemite 10.10.5 fully updated, on a pretty old Mac Book Pro.  ul liI installed the latest Emacs 25.1 (overwriting Emacs 22.? Apple provides) using Homebrew./li liThe mouse certainly sets the point in other apps, including AquaMacs/li liLooking at keybindings via C-h b I see  bound to mouse-set-point/li liDouble-clicking does select the text where I double-click./li liI have a Bluetooth Logitech mouse, but I have turned that off and that did not help./li /ul  Google search offers nothing.  I would also appreciate quidance on how to revert to earlier versions of Emacs so I can see if the mouse works on those.  ps. I forgot to mention I renamed my .emacs.d to eliminate that variable. pps. I installed Emacs 25.1 from https://emacsformacosx.com/builds and the mouse works fine.
