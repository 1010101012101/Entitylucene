How to set Finder to *always* use list view <body> I'm using Finder on macOS, and one major frustration I have is the disorganized grid view that always ends up cluttered and messy until I right click and 'Clean Up by Name'.  I don't mind the grid view in itself, but I'm also fine with list view. What I want is a system where it will use list view 100% of the time, NOT on a folder-by-folder basis, which is what happens when I click on the list view icon in the title bar.  Any help would be much appreciated.  <answer284468> ul liOpen finder/li liSelect your hard disc/li liOption+j/li liCheck the top two check boxes (Always open in list view, browse in list view)/li liClick use as defaults/li liOpen Applications-Utilities-Terminal/li /ul   precodesudo find / -name ".DS_Store"  -exec rm {} \; /code/pre   ul liEnter your root password, press enter/li /ul  <comment358770> For anybody who is not aware, .DS_Store files are files generated by Finder to remember the view that they are opened in. In this case, they are deleted to set all folders back to the default.
