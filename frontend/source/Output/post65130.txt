Is it possible to set Magic Trackpad option via Terminal? <body> Is it possible to set the magic trackpad options with the menu topics:   ul liPoint click, /li liscroll &amp; zoom,/li lietc./li /ul  by using the Terminal?  <answer65132> You can use defaults to edit property lists. But Magic Trackpads and laptop trackpads have different settings, and they are stored in different places in different versions of OS X.  Here's some commands from the .osx file by @MathiasBynens:  precode# Trackpad: enable tap to click for this user and for the login screen defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad Clicking -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1 defaults write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.mouse.tapBehavior -int 1  # Trackpad: map bottom right corner to right-click defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick -int 2 defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadRightClick -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.trackpadCornerClickBehavior -int 1 defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.enableSecondaryClick -bool true  # Trackpad: swipe between pages with three fingers defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool true defaults -currentHost write NSGlobalDomain com.apple.trackpad.threeFingerHorizSwipeGesture -int 1 defaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad TrackpadThreeFingerHorizSwipeGesture -int 1 /code/pre  The first ones don't enable tap to click on the login screen in Mountain Lion. code-currentHost/code wouldn't be needed in all cases. It modifies files in code~/Library/Preferences/ByHost//code that are specific to the current computer and have precedence over files in code~/Library/Preferences//code.  You can diff the output of defaults read to find keys for preferences.

Even version specific too. <comment335570> I think your link to `.osx` is starting to rot; it seems to be a soft-redirect to https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos
