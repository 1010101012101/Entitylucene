Importing modules in python gives syntax error <body> Whenever I try to import modules from python source code files using the python shell(installed in brew folder), I get the following error :  precode&gt;&gt;&gt; from not import *;   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1     from not import *;            ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax /code/pre  Can anyone please help!?  <answer145500> codenot/code is a built in boolean operator so you can't use it as the name of a module. If you're trying to load this symbolic negation module: https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/Not.py , you need codefrom Not import */code (python is case sensitive)  Incidentally, using codefrom x import */code is a bad idea in most cases. It breaks static code analysis, it can hide bugs, and you import all kinds of stuff into your namespace. Apart from a few specific use cases, it's probably better to import only what you need or to leave the module its own namespace.
