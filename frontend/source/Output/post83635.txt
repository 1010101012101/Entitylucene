When editing files on a (Windows?) networked drive I get "could not be saved" errors <body> When I edit files that are stored locally, everything works fine, but when editing files that are stored on my networked home directory (at uni here), I get:  precodeThe document "&lt;x&gt;" could not be saved. /code/pre  when I try to save a file. If I then close the program (XCode), I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EleMb.png" alt="Error1"  If I click duplicate, and then reopen the file, the changes I just made are all there. And as far as I can tell, no duplicate file is created. With TextEdit I get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a9HY7.png" alt="Error2"  I've lost the browser tab now, but I read something that was saying this will only happen for programs that use OSX's autosave feature or something? So far, I get the error message in XCode and TextEdit, but not TextWrangler.  The networked drive is at code/Volumes/Student/Home/myUsername//code, and I emthink/em it's a windows drive, but I'm not sure.  strongEDIT:/strong As requested, codedf/code:  precodeFilesystem                             512-blocks       Used   Available Capacity  iused      ifree %iused  Mounted on /dev/disk0s2                           1951845952   92568016  1858765936     5% 11635000  232345742    5%   / devfs                                         363        363           0   100%      629          0  100%   /dev map -hosts                                      0          0           0   100%        0          0  100%   /net map auto_home                                   0          0           0   100%        0          0  100%   /home map -fstab                                      0          0           0   100%        0          0  100%   /Network/Servers //myUsername@domain.edu.au/student        285149176   74120992   211028184    26%        0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/student //myUsername@domain.edu.au/student/Home 17203089400 5130812464 12072276936    30%        0 18446744073709551615    0%   /Volumes/student/Home /code/pre  , and codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI                         209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            999.3 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  <answer88718> Autosave is not working, you might not have sufficient permission on that volume. You should try rebuild the permissions or take the folder ownership using codechown -R/code.  "â€¦ does not support permanent storage" means Versions is not working because the volume is not HFS+, it must be NTFS or FAT and you are using a protocol such as smb.   Apps who aren't using Version and Autosave have no problems. If you want to disable these look here.  <comment96281> Next time you are at the computer, capture `df` and `diskutil list` in case that helps explain what paths are mounted to which shares and drives. <comment96284> @bmike Added to question.
