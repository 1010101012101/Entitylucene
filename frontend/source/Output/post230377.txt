Archive Upload Failed due to error -22421 <body> I was going to upload an app to iTunes Store, everything was going perfect, app validation test is also successfully completed, but when I tried to submit my app it gives an error.  Here a screenshot of the error:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vk3Dl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Someone please can explain me the reason of this error and also to suggest me what to do. Thanks.  <answer245709> iPad Multitasking support requires all the orientations but your app does not, so you need to opt out of it, just add the UIRequiresFullScreen key to your Xcode projectâ€™s Info.plist file and apply the Boolean value YES.  <answer282495> It's Apple's servers issues. You should try again and again...  <comment326084> I get this every now and then... If I wait a few minutes and retry, it works, so it seems to indicate some problem on Apple's servers.
