Is there a command line mail program for Mac? <body> My C++ professor has had us use Terminal for editing code. Is there an app or program that will allow me to send and receive email via Terminal, so I can stay in one window?  <answer44765> Take a look at the mail command. It will let you send and receive email in the Terminal.  <answer44783> For a full fledged terminal based email client that supports most email protocols, I'd suggest using mutt. You can download mutt from here, if you'd like to build from source. This webpage gives you directions on how to install on OS X.  If you use codehomebrew/code, then installing is as simple as codebrew install mutt/code (and similarly for codefink/code and codemacports/code).  Here are a few basic steps to get your code.muttrc/code configured:  precode#Set account info set spoolfile=/var/spool/mail/jdoe #if using IMAP, use imaps://example.com/INBOX set folder="$HOME/mail"            #if using IMAP, use imaps://example.com/ set imap_user=jdoe set from='jdoe@example.com' set realname='John Doe' set signature="~/.signature"  #Mailbox behaviour set mail_check=15                  #check for new mail set timeout=30 set include=yes                    #quote when replying  #Compose/reply/etc... set editor=vim                     #change to your favourite command line editor   ignore headers * unignore headers from to subject date cc hdr_order from to cc subject date set fast_reply                     #don't ask for to, subject when replying unset metoo                        #remove myself from replies set sort=date-received /code/pre  You can customize these further as you wish, and there are also some useful questions in the codemutt/code tag on Unix.SE and StackOverflow  <answer44785> This sure takes me back to my university days...  Mutt has still got to be one of the best terminal-based mail clients out there. It's been around longer than I'd like to admit. It's available as a homebrew package:  precode&gt; brew info mutt mutt 1.5.21 http://www.mutt.org/ Depends on: tokyo-cabinet Not installed http://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/mutt.rb /code/pre  Overall you'll get a much better experience using something like Mutt than you will with something like codemail/code because it supports IMAP, POP3 and SMTP -- you don't have to learn sendmail or anything like that to get it to work with your accounts.  You can even use Mutt with Gmail if that's your bag. See this article for details on setting up Mutt to work with Gmail.  Pretty colours...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zXCxm.png" alt="Mutt in action"  <answer44788> Yes and here is another one called the Alpine Messaging System a.k.a Alpine. Available from the University of Washington     Alpine is a free software email client developed at the University of Washington.   Alpine 1.0 was publicly released on December 20, 2007.   The name "Alpine" stands for Alternatively Licensed Program for Internet News and Email.   Alpine is a rewrite of the Pine Message System that adds support for Unicode and other features. Alpine is meant to be suitable for both inexperienced email users and the most demanding of power users. Alpine is developed at the University of Washington, as was Pine before it. Alpine can be learned by exploration and the use of context-sensitive help. The user interface can be customized.   If you install MacPorts you can install alpine by doing the following:  precodesudo port install alpine /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kBmjp.png" alt="Alpine 2.0 in action"  <comment50921> Tip: You can link to the Mac OS X man pages through developer.apple.com, the Mac's version of a command-line program doesn't always work exactly the same way as the corresponding Linux one; here's the man page for mail: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/mail.1.html <comment53896> LOL. A down vote. Disgruntled PINE user maybe? Sucks to be stuck in the dark ages of terminal mail programs. :) <comment312517> After installing mutt via `homebrew`, I could view my local email (/var/mail/admin), but couldn't delete anything -- mutt kept saying the mailbox was "read-only." Turns out I had to add myself to the `mail` group to be able to delete: `dseditgroup -o edit -u [username] -p -a [username] -t user mail`. Don't know if that happens when installing via other methods, but it sounds like a Darwin thing, so it probably does. <comment352979> or if you use homebrew "brew install alpine"
