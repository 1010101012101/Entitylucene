Automator Service to zip files and return archive path <body> I have a service which takes a file or files from Finder and archives them. This all works fine.  I have it set to save the archive in the Same Folder as Input.  However, if I have a selection of files from multiple folders (by using Search), the archive is saved in the same folder as the first file in the list.  I am quite happy with this and donâ€™t want to select a different folder.  What I would like though, is to return a message telling me the path to the archive.  So, to recap  Display path of first file from list of files sent to Create Archive  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EZ6wC.jpg" alt="Automator Flow"  Thanks in anticipation
