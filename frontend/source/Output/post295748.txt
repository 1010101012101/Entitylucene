Ways to highlight during a presentation <body> I miss the old emOmniDazzle/em product from The Omni Group that let us transform the mouse pointer in a variety of ways, some silly but some quite practical. Worked well for highlighting areas of the screen to focus the attention of the audience during a talk or presentation.   I'm looking to make the mouse pointer more obvious, or darken the screen while keeping one region bright, or drawing colored crayon/marker lines, and so on.   strongAccessibility features/strong  I'm open to accessibility features in macOS that could work to focus the audience’s attention.  strongKeynote features/strong  Mainly I use Apple Keynote for presentations. If Keynote has dynamic tools for focusing the audience’s attention, that would be helpful.  I also show other apps such as programmers’ IDEs during a talk, so using it outside of Kenote is ideal.  strongOther solutions/strong  Are there other ways or other apps to accomplish this goal?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ljlVZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sr116.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295763> For strongKeynote/strong presentations, by using an iOS device as a remote one can draw or use a ‘laser’ pointer on the slides. Although not as elegant as drawing focus to an element, it certainly grabs attention.   strongiOS Remote:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TjbbF.jpg" alt="laser pointer"  strongDisplay with drawing to highlight:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y5uM5.png" alt="drawing"  <answer295768> h3Mouseposé/h3     When turned on, it dims the screen and puts a spotlight on the area   around the mouse pointer, easily guiding the audience‘s attention to   an area of interest.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/skHnvm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Additionally, it has the mouse click visualization and typing visualization - both allowing your audience to see what you click and type.  They have a video on their site  that shows the software in action.    br  h3Ink2Go/h3     Ink2Go is an extremely simple and powerful screen annotation and   recording software. Using Ink2Go you can easily write on top of any   other application currently active on the desktop, even on a running   video.   There is a 15 day free trail available at their website. They have both Windows and Mac versions.  In addition, there is a number of YouTube videos showing the product in action  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nxP1Hm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This one may be a bit of overkill given all the features, but I have seen this at work in an education setting and it's excellent software.  <answer295831> h1Logitech Spotlight Presentation Remote/h1  Apple says:      With Spotlight you can take a giant step beyond traditional laser pointing. This advanced system lets you precisely highlight or magnify areas of focus in pixel-perfect detail. It's clearly visible to both the audience in the room and everyone watching via video conference.

Just mirroring the screen?  If you use Keynote with iOS you can use the 'laser' pointer or draw on the screen.  All depends on what your requirements are.  Cheers <comment373511> @bjbk See edits. Mainly Keynote, but also other apps. <comment373512> Do we assume that everytime someone offers a comment with a possible solution you are just going to add it to your answer? That seems to be a bit de-motivating... <comment373513> @Solar Mike, What problem do you see with the edit Basil Bourque made? It addresses the comment made by bjbk and adds value to his question. This is in part what comment are for, and to that I say to Basil Bourque, +1 for improving the quality of the question being asked! <comment373517> adds an answer into his question... <comment373518> @SolarMike I edited the Question to be more specific, added details, while maintaining the essence of the issue. As user3439894 said, that is the point of comments on a Stack Exchange. If I am confused, please cite some documentation such as the Help section or Meta site to correct me. As for "adds an answer into his question", you're point escapes me. <comment373519> The basic premise of the site is that the best answers are voted to the top - unless I have misunderstood how it works , so it just seems that if I wished to add an answer it would just get incorporated and loose its value. <comment373522> @Solar Mike, There's absolutely nothing wrong with the edit he made to his question, nor did he answer his own question, nor has an answer been offered in the comments. I'm quite sure that if an appropriate answer gets posted, as an answer not a comment, it will get the proper attention. It's evident from his question history, he knows what he's doing. He has up voted and or marked as accepted the majority of answers posted to his questions. So I don't understand why you make a comment like "so it just seems that if I wished to add an answer it would just get incorporated and loose its value." <comment373615> Wow, this a clever idea… and, what a price. <comment373637> Wow! What a find!
