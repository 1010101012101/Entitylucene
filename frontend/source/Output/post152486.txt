Mission control: switch to desktop1 + show desktop <body> I'm bored of pressing 2 key shortcuts  need to write a script that tells mission control the following:  ol liif not at desktop1, switch to desktop 1/li liperform "show desktop" (windows will be hidden\displayed, depending on how they are now)/li /ol  h2PS: where can i find info on taming Mission Control and Finder?/h2  currently i use it like this:  precodetell application "System Events"     key code 18 using {option down, command down} --current shortcut for "Switch to Desktop 1"     key code 103 --current shortcut to "Show Desktop" end tell /code/pre  but there is no check for "i'm on desktop 1 already", and no toggle (show\hide windows)  <answer152624> Did you consider using Keyboard Maestro?  Here you can see how I deal with this. I use it to change between screens, but is really easy to modify per your requests.  <answer152797> The in-n-out cannot be avoided with applescript, to my knowledge.  precodetell application "System Events"      do shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control"     delay 0.5     tell process "Dock" to tell group 1 to tell list 1 to tell button 1 to click     delay 0.5      do shell script "/Applications/Mission\\ Control.app/Contents/MacOS/Mission\\ Control 1"  end tell /code/pre  <comment179779> thank you very much! actually, i want to do it with applescripts.
