How can I get ^C to show up when I do Control-C on a Mac terminal? <body> If I type a command, and halfway through I decide not to run that command, I do a Control-C to cancel it without having to backspace the whole thing, e.g. codemv foo.txt bar.txt/code. On Ubuntu it'll show up as codemv foo.txt bar.txt^C/code to remind me I cancelled it, but on Mac it shows up as just codemv foo.txt bar.txt/code. Any way to get that code^C/code behaviour on Mac?  <answer237849> On most Unix systems you can modify the shell to either show the output of the control character as the character or as a "^C".  This can be done with the codeechoctl/code or codectlecho/code stty modes.  Use codestty echoctl/code to print the ^C characters  and codestty -echoctl/code to allow the shell to print the control character as the actual character, a codeSIGINT/code in this case.  Doing this on a Linux machine seems to alter the behavior correctly, but on my MAC it will not show the character either way, on 10.11.something.  <answer244650> I'm not entirely sure of this, but for a different reason I upgrade the Bash on my machine (codebrew install bash/code) and this behaviour started to show up. This post is what I followed to update Bash. It would be good practice not to overwrite your old Bash but instead just use the new one. Brew puts the new Bash at code/local/usr/bin/bash/code anyway.  <comment291507> It shows `^C` for me in Terminal under OS X 10.8.5.  What version of OS X are you running? <comment291510> I'm on 10.10.5. It shows up when a cancel a process halfway through, but not when I press Control-C before even hitting Enter <comment291518> @user3439894 I'm running 10.11.1 and it doesn't show `^C` for me, either. <comment291519> @user3439894 Maybe it only shows `^C` in older versions? <comment291530> From your last sentence this is not an answer <comment291538> Try updating bash with homebrew if that's what you use <comment291539> This was reported as a bug:  http://superuser.com/questions/189127/mac-os-terminal-keyboard-echo-breaks-after-ctrl-c-with-some-applications
