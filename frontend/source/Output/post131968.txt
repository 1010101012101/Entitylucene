Apple Contacts- creating a group with only one of the addresses in Contact card <body> I want to create a Christmas card group from my Contacts list. However, I only want to use the home address and NOT the work address or alternate address. Is there any way I can just pick one of the addresses when I add them to the group?  <answer132013>    If members of a group in Contacts have multiple addresses or phone   numbers, you can select which address or number to use when sending   email to that group or when printing contact information.   ul liChoose Edit  Edit Distribution List./li liSelect the group. You canâ€™t select Smart Groups./li liClick the rightmost column header to choose the information to manage: email (address), phone (number), or (street) address./li liSelect an address or number for each member./li /ul  Source: From the Help menu in Contacts on Mavericks.  <comment155092> iOS?
