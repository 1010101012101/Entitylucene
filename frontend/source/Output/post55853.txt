How to link one pdf to several others for use on iPad? <body> I want to use an iPad as an electronic 'Program' or Agenda for a conference. We would like to have a single document serve as the Agenda where one can open it, see the time and day of the presentations, the author and title. Then, select a hyperlink to open a copy of the presentation and/or written paper.  This is easily done on a PC and .pdfs but I have not solved it for the iPad. I am not Apple-savvy. Also, I am beginning to think that a dedicated App may be required of which I have never written an app either.  <comment64107> I won't say this is impossible (or even not achievable today) but the big problem is the file system. On the iPad, there isn't a file system exposed to you the user. Even using relative folder location or when files link to another in the same folder/directory seems unlikely to work. Do you encode absolute file paths on the PC? <comment64113> Will the linked presentations / papers be accessible via the internet? This simplifies the problem in that you could use traditional PDF hyperlinks. <comment64114> Speaking of hyperlinks in PDFs... If all the papers/presentations are in PDF form, you could just use on monolithic PDF with internal references. <comment64206> http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11082/adding-table-of-contents-to-existing-pdf and http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/11520/pdfpages-and-linktodoc
