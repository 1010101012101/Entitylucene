How to access Turkish letters via Accent Character Menu on MacBook? <body> If I'd hold a key on my codeMacBook/code, I get a nice pop-up with the accents for that particular letter. Now, I can see that not all letters are being shown. For example, I'd like to show the Turkish letters strongŞ/strong, strongğ/strong and strongı/strong but I can't see it.   I already added the Turkish keyboard via the settings, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. Maybe I did something wrong, I don't know...   Could someone help me out please?  <comment321304> No one who can help? <comment321322> You have to customize the Character Picker.
