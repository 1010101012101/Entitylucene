Check log files for file transfer <body> I would like if there is a way to capture in a log file all the transfer file activities in a given time period. Let me give you an example. Let's say that on 16 Aug 2017 13:35 I copy/move a file/folder from my Mac to a usb device without giving any special arguments when using the codecp/mv/code commands (in any case copying/moving files/folders can be achieved through GUI).   Is there any text file on the Mac which records the activity history (such as copying/moving files/folders)? I would like this text file to include information in a way like:  code16 Aug 2017 13:35 path/to/folderA was copied to /path/to/usb/stick//code or something similar.  <answer295388> You can manually use the Terminal command codecp/code (copy) or codemv/code (move) with the code-v/code (for verbose) qualifier to keep a log of what is being copied. Verbose only shows file names, no dates.  You should look at codeman cp/code and codeman mv/code for more details.  Ex:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RSaMS.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you're looking for capturing log data for Finder drags, or disk activity from within apps, I'm not sure how that would be done.  <comment372946> What actual problem are you trying to solve?  Your question reads like [an XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem).  Can you [edit] it to include any error messages you're getting or include a statement of the issue you're facing?  Open-ended questions, like this is currently structured, don't really fit well on a Q&A site (see [help/dont-ask]). <comment372947> @fsb Tried to reformulate. <comment372957> This can be accomplished with DTrace scripts like opensnoop or iosnoop (which run in separate Terminal windows). DTrace is rather a dev tool which requires some expertise than a common day-to-day user tool with some pretty GUI. Even after editing your question it's still unclear what your problem really is.
