Open a large XML file <body> I am trying to open a relatively large XML file (50mb) but my Mac just won't open it: No errors though, just been waiting for almost 10 minutes but nothing happens.  Tried using strongTextEditor, Xcode/strong  Any other suggestions?   <answer290476> Try Sublime Text or Atom to open your XML file.  <answer290477> I use Sublime Text 3 to do some of my editing. A very nice and fairly fast programmable (with plugins) editor. I've just tried it on a 50 mb text file and it didn't seem to have a problem. Sublime Text 3 is not free but their free trial period seems to be endless. While I was checking Sublime Text I tried Atom too. Atom was slower at loading but once it got loaded it seemed fine.  <answer290481> If you just want to open it (not edit), try codexmllint/code command in Terminal:  precodexmllint --format ~/Desktop/file.xml /code/pre  There's man page for codexmllint/code command line tool: Go here  <answer290494> My goto editor for large files is BBEdit. I've opened much larger files (200MB+ log files) without any slowdown. I've even used it to open binary files in order to look for ascii strings. If BBEdit can't open it, nothing can.  <answer290504> Depending on the source of the file, you may wish to investigate its contents in other ways than just opening it (double clicking).  For this, you should use the command line.  Some suggested starting points (where "whatever.xml" is the name of the file):  precodefile whatever.xml /code/pre  This will tell you what emtype/em the file is.  Not by file extension, but by actual examination of the contents.  precodehead whatever.xml /code/pre  This will show you the first ten lines of the file.  However, be warned: It emis/em possible to have an entire 50 MB XML file consisting of a single line.  Press Ctrl-C to stop if it starts spewing garbage.  (Yes, strongControl/strong C, not Command-C.)  To just view the file without even the possibility of editing it:  precodeless whatever.xml /code/pre  If the file emdoes/em consist of very long lines, for reading it, you could force periodic line wraps (formatting):  precodefmt whatever.xml | less /code/pre  But actually, codeless/code will wrap the lines by default unless you tell it not to.  For no wrapping of lines (so you can use sideways arrow keys to scroll):  precodeless -S whatever.xml /code/pre  hr  strongIt is a good probability/strong that one of these commands will disclose a problem with the file.  <comment366663> Have you verified that the file isn't corrupt?  If you `cat` the file, can you see the contents?  In Terminal, type `cat foobar.xml` <comment366698> I've used TextWrangler successfully on very large files and it won't choke the way Sublime or others might. Since they are "sunsetting" TextWrangler in favour of BBEdit, I say this is correct. If you have an old copy of TW, that could work too. <comment366702> I had originally written a paragraph about why I was recommending BBEdit over TextWrangler but deleted it because it didn't seem relevant to the question and it was longer than my actual answer. <comment366715> yes, the file is not corrupt, I have a bunch of similar XML files, all of the ones that are a small size 1-5mb are opening just fine.
