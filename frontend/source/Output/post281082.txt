Start up and OS X Mavericks download issues <body> Having some issues with my Mac - specifically, am faced with a screen containing the Apple logo and computer programming code, that is then stuck on a reboot loop. I was previously also faced with a 'stop sign' screen - but seem to have managed to get past this issue.   All of this began as my computer was working very slowly. I decided to wipe it via the disk utility option (i.e. Macintosh HD  Erase). Am now faced with the Apple logo+computer programming code screen, stuck on a reboot loop, when I login. If I hold command+shift+p+r, I can make my way to the disk utility home page again. However, trying to download OS X Mavericks (which is the version option I'm presented with) to take 30+ hours.   I've tried rebooting in safe mode. I've also tried seeing if I can 'flush dns cache' (not sure what that means exactly - I have been surfing forums) - in any case, I am unable to input any code into the 'Terminal' in Applications  Utilities as it is greyed out.   I'm obviously not an expert. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot guys.  Tried uploading an image of the code screen but doesn't seem to be working.
