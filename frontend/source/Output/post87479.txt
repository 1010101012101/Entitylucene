set remote sharing prefs in terminal <body> I am admin for department and I want to batch change the "show remote management status in menu bar" so that I don't have to log in to each machine and set it.  I have ARD so I can run a terminal command across all machines I just can't seem to find out how to set that option through the terminal   Could anyone tell me how to do that ? or if it's even possible ?  <answer87515> The easiest tool to set these settings programatically is the kickstart script that Apple ships:     sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -help   Do read the help since, it warns strongemThis script can be used to grant very permissive incoming access permissions.  Do not use the -activate and -configure features unless you know exactly what you're doing./em/strong  That being said, you will want to set a variable $ObserveUser for each user that should be shown a menu indication that screen observation is in progress:     sudo kickstart -configure -access -on -privs -ShowObserve -users $ObserveUser   <comment102233> This will certainly be possible. I'll bookmark it to come back, but you'll either need to find the `defaults write com.apple.whatever` preference that needs to be written to enable or suppress the menu bar or just have your script install a profile to control the preference systematically rather than graphically. <comment102256> Have you tried `defaults write  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.RemoteManagement LoadRemoteManagementMenuExtra -bool true`? <comment102265> i have not but i could try that
