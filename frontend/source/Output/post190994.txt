OS X Photos will not export videos <body> When I try to export a video on Photos, it makes no progress whatsoever. It also temporarily freezes my computer. Help!  <answer191001> Had the same issue the other day as well with larger videos.  Ended up just copying and pasting the video from its raw location.     ~/UserName/Pictures/Photos Library/Masters/Year/##/##/file.mov   The above file path is a general description of where the raw data sits for the Photos.app.  It is not user friendly and not made to be searched through.  I found the easiest way to find the exact path to a .mov/.pic you want is to use terminal.  Open up /Utilites/Terminal.app:  type:  precodemdfind filename.mov /code/pre  This will return the exact path to the raw file and from their you can copy and paste it whatever you would like.
