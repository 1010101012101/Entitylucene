How can you import Wireless Network (WiFi) passwords / settings to Mac OSX 10.10 from a text, html or xml file? <body> I'm trying to transfer WiFi settings of saved networks from a Windows PC to a Macbook.  I have exported the wireless settings via the freeware WirelessKeyView to a txt file (can also be created as a html or xml file).  Is it possible to import these settings to the Macbook so that it saves the wireless network names and passwords?  I have no knowledge of coding and I'm totally new to Mac. However I'm eager to learn.  Thank you.  <comment290724> Take a look at [this answer](http://superuser.com/a/950383/584424) and see if it helps.  It doesn't look like it will be easy unless someone has written a tool for it. <comment290738> @Raystafarian suggested to type in the following in the Terminal app: networksetup -addpreferredwirelessnetworkatindex $device_name $SSID $Index $Security_type $Password  What do these 3 correspond to?: $device_name  $SSID  $Index   E.g. I have the following info for a wireless network: Netowrk name:abc  Connection Type:ESS  Authentication:WPA2PSK  Encryption:AES  Password:12345678  Also, can several networks be imported simultaneously via this method? <comment290749> @fbara thanks it worked! Just need a script to read the txt file and parse it to the above mentioned command. <comment290750> @Raystafarian thanks for your solution. Going to search for that script you mentioned in your answer [http://superuser.com/a/950383/584424]
