How do I enable the Java console in Firefox? <body> I'm using MacOSX 10.5.8 and the default Java provided by Apple (e.g. /usr/bin/java - /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/Current/Commands/java). My web browser is Firefox 3.6.12.  I'd like to view the Java console to debug some Java applets which I access with Firefox.  How can I enable the Java console?  <answer4154> This is not done via any Firefox configuration option, but an account wide Java setting:  Open the strongJava Preferences/strong utility which you can find in Applications - Utilities.   There, under the Advanced tab, and "Java console", choose "Show console". img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jsb4E.png" alt="alt text"  <comment3971> I have tried this, and I still do not see a console. I believe that the console may be active, but does not automatically become visible when I open a Java applet. <comment3973> Well, eventually this did work. I had to change "Run applets:" back to the default "Within Browser Process', and now the console works. I did try both options before, and neither worked. <comment3981> Ah, I didn't know about the "Run applets" setting, but glad you got it working :)
