TeamSpeak 3 server and launchd <body> So I followed the instructions on TeamSpeak forum itself. Everybody there seem to put this to work, and I'm the only one who gets simply no result at all. Since people in TeamSpeak forum are more windows users, and some are linux users, and just one or two actually use mac os to serve teamspeak, I am now asking here for the help.  This is what I want to do:br Run TeamSpeak 3 Server as a daemon, both on snow leopard and SL server.br [solved] launchd and Teamspeak 3 - SUCCESS  My results: no connection, no ts3 process on the activity monitor, no nothing happening, it will work ok just if I open terminal and launch TS3 manually.  Thank you guys!  My plist file, made on textedit.app, saved as plain text:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt; &lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt; &lt;false/&gt; &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;local.ts3s&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt; &lt;string&gt;/Users/fernando/TeamSpeak3Server/ts3server_mac&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; &lt;key&gt;UserName&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;fernando&lt;/string&gt; &lt;key&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/key&gt; &lt;string&gt;/Users/fernando/TeamSpeak3Server/&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt;  /code/pre  <comment60340> Is there anything in the various log files under `/var/log`? <comment60341> And I assume you replaced UserName and WorkingDirectory to match your local setup. Can you please post your launchd plist? <comment60343> I am searching the logs. Finder and spotlight can't find a thing, looking by myself I can't find nothing also. The only thing I can find is a single file named "launchd-shutdown.log", and it's duplicate with a -1 on the name - but not a single ts or teamspeak or team speak mention inside of it. <comment60344> The plist (or the launched process) will fail if ts3server wants to write in its working directoy. Try to install it in a directory where `fernando` has write access. <comment60345> And how do you execute the plist at all? By rebooting the system or directly in Terminal `launchctl load ts3server.plist`? <comment60346> This (http://d.pr/f/71tC) works for me if loaded directly in Terminal (and ts3server definitively needs write access for log files etc.) <comment60349> Changed ts3 folder to /users/fernando/ts3... made the respective changes to plist file. reboot had same result: nothing. tried this launchctl code on my terminal, had the "file not found" error. my plist file is /Library/LaunchDaemons/local.ts3.plist <comment60353> Just tried your file on /Library/LaunchDaemons/ `Mac-mini:~ fernando$ launchctl load ts3server.plist launchctl: Couldn't stat("ts3server.plist"): No such file or directory nothing found to load` <comment60355> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3643/discussion-between-patrix-and-pierobon)
