Terminal problem: dhcp mode <body> Everytime I start terminal, it says dhcp instead of my account name. Why is this and how do I exit out of it?  precodedhcp-205122:~ NAME$  /code/pre  <answer209675> In some more sophisticated networks, the prompt may be overwritten by the network providing you with the name given by the DHCP server there.

All other characters in the mix are representing themselves. So, such a prompt would convert to something like the following:br/ codeblackmouse@bm-computer:/Library/Application Support $/codebr/ User and computer name are fictive as I, for obvious reasons, do not know your real computer user or computer name and the path will change to whatever directory you are in.
