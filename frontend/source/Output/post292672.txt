My mac details: MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) OS X Yosemite 10.10.5  Kindly help me please.....  <comment369215> Welcome to Ask Different. :) Unfortunately, your question doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Can you please edit your question to include the exact model of MacBook Air you're referring to (at least I'm assuming that's what you mean by _mac air_). Also, what version of macOS are you running? Finally, can you clarify whether this situation has *always* been the case, or is it *new* behaviour that started at some point?
