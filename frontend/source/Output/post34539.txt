Lion opens lots of windows automatically after a restart. How can I stop that? <body> Lion opens lots of windows automatically after a restart. How can I stop that?  It's emvery/em annoying.  Is there a way to stop this?  I found an option in System Preferences ("Restore windows when quitting and re-opening apps") and disabled it but it doesn't seem to affect anything.  <answer34540> Just uncheck the "Reopen windows when logging back in" checkbox in the restart dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RTYSF.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer34557> What you are experiencing are the benefits of working with strongresume/strong. A feature introduced with Mac OS X Lion.  ul liIt restores the state of the computer when shut down. Very useful, when having to restart because of some installation procedure./li liIt reopens the used windows of applications. Quite useful since you do not have to navigate to a files location. Instead, just open the needed application to open the file./li /ul  Unchecking the box does not have a permanent effect. This can be achieved by manual tweaking.  h3Disable Resume upon login permanently/h3  Open the Terminal and enter:  precodecurl http://goo.gl/Z4EFC -L -s -o ~/fixlogin.sh &amp;&amp; md5 -q ~/fixlogin.sh | xargs -I % mv ~/fixlogin.sh ~/%.sh &amp;&amp; chmod +x ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh &amp;&amp; sudo ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh ; rm ~/121dca51e66073624da420b6e1be61d9.sh /code/pre  This command downloads a script and fully installs it. Voil√†, you are done.  If you want to revert to the default behavior of resume in lion, type this.  precodesudo defaults delete com.apple.loginwindow LoginHook /code/pre  Kudos to Hexbrain who wrote the script.  hr  h3Disable Resume when launching apps/h3  You can also disable Resume for applications on a per app basis. See these answers here.  <answer62315> The checkbox has stayed unchecked in 10.7.4 and later versions. The release notes called it an issue, even though it was probably intended behavior originally.     The OS X Lion v10.7.4 Update includes fixes that:      ul   liResolve an issue in which the "Reopen windows when logging back in" setting is always enabled./li   /ul   The state of applications is still restored even if Resume was disabled when applications are opened manually or as login items. Disabling codeLoginwindowLaunchesRelaunchApps/code or codeTALLogoutSavesState/code doesn't prevent that either.  <comment39455> I tried that. It doesn't remember the setting. <comment39466> Yes, that's a feature - not a bug. To be honest, I agree that this is seriously messed up. Why? Because this behavior is **inconsistent** with the behavior of checkboxes in other system settings. <comment39473> I see how the script works. Excellent. Ta. <comment41459> You know, OS/2 Warp had this stupid feature in 1994. It was as annoying and unhelpful then as it is know. I can't believe Apple would resurrect a feature from 15 years and sell it as new. <comment54537> I believe this is a really good feature. The only thing they could possibly improve, is remembering the selection on checkbox so you don't have to un-tick every time if you don't need it. <comment54538> @latusaki I agree 100%. This behavior is inconsistent with other checkboxes you find anywhere in the OS :/. Hence, the workaround in the answer.
