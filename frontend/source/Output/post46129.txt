How to translate between Windows and Mac -style file locations? <body> For an office with mostly Windows workstations and a few OS X workstations, what's the easiest way for the Mac users to translate to and from a Windows-style file paths?  For example, to automatically translate code\\fileserver01\client-files\client01\comp.psd/code, if sent in an email, to code//fileserver01/client-files/client01/comp.psd/code?  <answer46138> This site has a way to translate into a mac network location and open it: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20040322155331393  So you could easily save that as a text service and be able to select a windows network location, right-click it, and have it translated and opened.  I imagine you could sort of reverse the function and translate back into a windows network location string.  Here's how to set up a text service to convert to a Mac path and open it in Finder:  ul liOpen up Automator/li liChoose "Service"/li liDrag a "Run AppleScript" item from the library into the main area on the right./li liCopy and paste this AppleScript into it: https://gist.github.com/2211017 (it wouldn't properly format in here)/li liSave it under "Convert and Open Windows Path" or whatever you like./li liSelect a path in an application, right-click it, and look for the service you created (it might be under a "Services" sub-menu)/li /ul  Here's what your Automator service should look like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zTeZR.png" alt="Automator Service Example"  <answer160067> I know this is an old exchange, but it still works. I forked the code to show an example of converting a network drive path to an SMB protocol with a server IP address.   This is helpful if windows users have a lettered network drive such as W:\a\really\tedious\folder\path  https://gist.github.com/jberg412/036484376a56f09e1a4a  Thanks for the original script PenguinRob.  precodeon searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)     set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString     set newText to text items of theText     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString     set newText to newText as text     set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims     return newText end searchReplace  on run {input, parameters}      set myClip to the input     set mylocation to searchReplace(myClip, "&lt;", "")     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, "&gt;.", "")     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, "&gt;", "")     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, "\\", "/")     set mylocation to "smb:" &amp; mylocation     # convert Windows network drive paths to SMB addresses EXAMPLE:     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, "smb:W:", "smb://10.0.0.1/shares")     # check if the person who gave you the windows link used a lowercase drive letter:     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, "smb:w:", "smb://10.0.0.1/shares")     # fix issue with spaces     set mylocation to searchReplace(mylocation, " ", "%20")       tell application "Finder"         open location mylocation     end tell      # after setting the location, set Finder to topmost, or delete this section if you dont want that.     tell application "Finder"         activate     end tell       return input end run /code/pre  <comment52621> This is so close to a great answer. If you brought that AppleScript in to the answer from the reference site and then walked through how to set it up as a service you'd have a stellar answer. <comment52622> @IanC. were you referring to the first or second site? I'll do that. <comment52623> The first site. The MacWorld Hints page. <comment52627> Thanks for the suggestions Ian! Now I've learned how to make text services which I can already think of some uses for. <comment250029> The url https://gist.github.com/jberg412/036484376a56f09e1a4a is no longer valid. Does anyone have a copy of that script that they can post? <comment250051> A downvote and a request? Awesome. My github account was corrupted and repaired with a new user name, I couldn't possibly recall where all the links to it were. Try: https://gist.github.com/radio412/036484376a56f09e1a4a
