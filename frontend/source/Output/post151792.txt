Can I run a 32-bit Photoshop automation in Mavericks or Yosemite? <body> In my business I run Photoshop CS5's (and CS5.5's) web gallery function all the time.  Adobe got rid of it in consequent incarnations but I still use it regularly for my clients.  This automated function runs in 32 bit mode.  On my OS X 10.8 this is possible but was frightened of Mavericks and now even more of Yosemite.  Does anyone know if I will be able to run this function on either of those platforms with some sort of adjustment.  And if not, what can I do?  Can I run a virtual machine that still has OS X 10.8?
