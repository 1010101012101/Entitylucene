Wifi doesn't stay connected with 2010 MacBook Pro after upgrade to Mountain Lion <body> After upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion the Wi-Fi on my 2010 MBP basically stopped working. It would stay connected for a few minutes at a time and then drop the connection, connect, drop, etc.  My Wi-Fi access point continued to work with all other devices - it just stopped working on this one machine.  It appears that this issue is also in Lion - there are many threads on discussions.apple.com with users complaining about similar issues:  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4144707?start=0&amp;tstart=0  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3191630?start=0&amp;tstart=0  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3235078?start=0&amp;tstart=0  <answer59008> The only solution I found that actually worked was to replace the Mountain Lion Wi-Fi drivers with the ones included in Snow Leopard.  strongNOTE: This solution is not for the faint of heart and please ensure you've backed up your system/strong - at worst this should only bork your Wi-Fi (which I'm assuming is already broken if you're trying these steps) but it's better to be safe than sorry.  Insert the Snow Leopard DVD into your DVD drive.  Open a Terminal:  precodesudo -s cd /System/Library/Extensions mv IO80211Family.kext /Users/&lt;your acct&gt;/Desktop  cp -R /Volumes/Mac\ OS\ X\ Install\ DVD/System/Library/Extensions/IO80211Family.kext . /code/pre  Run Disk Utility and Repair Disk Permission on your system drive  Rebuild the kext cache:  precodesudo touch /System/Library/Extensions /code/pre  Wait a few minutes to ensure that the cache has been regenerated and then reboot.  <answer72880> I tried all the tips imaginable. The only solution was to set the channel on the wireless router on channel 11.  It seems to me, the Mountain Lion has a problem when the channel the router is in automatic, then every time the channel is changed, the connection of the wifi card of Macbook disconnects and reconnects.
