(Macbook Pro) Apps will not quit, no matter what, stops me from shutting down <body> (13 Inch Retina Mid-2014 Macbook pro) Alright, I think I made a post about this earlier, I don't remember. So, I have a Macbook Pro under a monitor stand, using a dell monitor for displays. Whenever I close an app thats not responding and reopen it again, it bounces for a long time, so I force quit it, it bounces for an additional 15-20 seconds and then stops. However, when you right click it, it still has the same options it would have if it were open, it still appears in the force quit (cmd alt esc) menu and stops me from shutting down or restarting the computer. It does NOT appear in activity monitor and there are no windows of it open. I've tried using every force quit option under the sun to quit said app, but it never seems to work. I will be rearranging my set up so I can get to the macbook easier to hardware shutdown, but are there any other ways to either A: Stop this from happening, B: Quit said app or C: Shut down the mac in another fashion? Thanks.  <comment248975> Yup, you asked this same question before - & we still have no details as to what Mac, what OS, what app. <comment248976> It has happened with Chrome Steam and uTorrent the most. <comment248977> Also, 13"(I think) Macbook Pro 2014/15 model. <comment248978> You need to edit this information [once you are actually certain of it] into your original question. <comment248979> Apologies, edited in now.
