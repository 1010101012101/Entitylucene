Add a delay to menubar dropdown in fullscreen apps <body> In Lion, the menubar drops down way to fast when I'm in a fullscreen app. This mostly becomes a problem when I have multiple tabs open in Terminal. When I move to the top to change tabs, the menubar drops down and I click it on accident. So is there any way to add a delay to the menubar dropping down? Or maybe change the drop down hotspot to one of the corners instead of just the top edge?  <answer44015> I don't believe this is possible in Lion.  For your specific problem, I'd just use the keyboard shortcuts to move to a new tab; it's much faster anyway.  To move to the next tab, kbdcommand/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbd}/kbd. To move to the previous tab, kbdcommand/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbd{/kbd.  <comment51122> Yeah keyboard shortcuts help with that specific problem but there are other times the menu bar is bothersome. I'll give you a vote up for the shortcut though :)
