Can I generate a clickable link to local file using relative path like "file:///~" <body> This is the background:  in my company, we use Google Drive and often have to tell each other the path to a particular file. Paths are long as we use a lot of nested folders, so it's pretty boring and time consuming to browse through all that.  Now, in my previous company, we used a central afp server, so the path was common to everyone, therefore I had created an applescript script that could get the absolute afp path to the file, people pasted that path in a mail or chat and the end user could click on that path which automatically became a link and the finder would open, selecting that particular file or folder that the link led to.  The reason I can't use the exact same script is that Google Drive folder is in the user home folder. So if user's name is Foo the path will be codefile:///Users/Foo/Google Drive/code, while for user Bar the path will be codefile:///Users/Bar/Google Drive/code  Clearly the path generated from user Foo won't work for user Bar  Since, at least in the terminal, the path to codefile:///Users/username/code equals to code~/code, I made my script generate links like codefile:///~/Google Drive/pathToFolder/code, but they do not work :( Clicking on such a link will open the finder, but won't select the right file or folder  This is driving me crazy because it looks like it should work but it simply doesn't... is there any other syntax I should try? Any suggestion?  Thanks in advance!  <answer175101> Here is the solution. The script that generates the link, generats a url that starts with a custom codegoogledrive:///code and then the path to the file in the Google Drive folder.  I then set lincastor to trigger the following script for urls beginning with codegoogledrive:///code  precodeon handle_url(args)     set theUnixPath to |URL_PATH| of args     set theUnixPath to (POSIX path of (path to home folder)) &amp; "Google Drive" &amp; theUnixPath     set theMacPath to (POSIX file theUnixPath)      #display dialog "handle url: " &amp; theMacPath       tell application "Finder"         set theItem to item theMacPath         if (class of theItem) is folder then activate         reveal theItem     end tell     activate application "Finder"      return 1 end handle_url /code/pre  The script is super easy, it takes the url, attaches the path to the user homes folder and code/Google Drive//code, then uses this generated path to open the Finder and reveal the item  <comment206024> Do you have access to the machines that will be opening these links? <comment206047> Yes i do, we're a small company, only 7 different machines <comment206100> You could try [LinCastor](https://onflapp.wordpress.com/lincastor/) (I don't have time to write up an answer right now, but hopefully that helps a little) <comment206226> Exactly, that's what I have done and it worked like a charm :) <comment206338> Great! Can you post it as an answer so other people can see what you did?
