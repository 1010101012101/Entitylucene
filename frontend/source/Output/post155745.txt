How do I configure Yosemite to be able to resolve DNS ending in ".local"? <body> Yosemite doesn't seem to understand any domain that ends in .local  My DNS server is pointed at the ip of the debian box, which runs dnsmasq.  It has a ton of apache sites configured that all have names like clientname.debserver.local - all which resolve fine from the other machines around the lan (not Yosemite).  (tried flushing cache, resetting network, rebooting, all the usual suspects)  <answer155767> Apple does not resolve code.local/code using a DNS server, but Apple Bonjour its codezeroconf/code impementation. You could install codeAvahi/code the Linux and BSD implementation.  I use codenetatalk/code on my Linux boxes to communicate with OS X  <answer155773> Apple has provided some related documentation here.  In which they recommend avoiding code.local/code if you can and instead using a suffix such as code.private/code, code.intranet/code, code.internal/code, or code.lan/code.  The reason code.local/code should be avoided is because it's used by the Bonjour service.  hr  h2Short Answer/h2  Add the following Search Domain as in the screenshot (you can disregard my DNS Server settings):   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybnGX.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2Long Answer/h2  Another possibility is documented here in an article about using Dnsmasq for local development on OS X and a related StackOverflow question in which someone seems to have found it successful except when their offline (which doesn't make a lot of since.. but the key point here is, it seems to work for them at least part of the time)  The linked article directs that you should create a directory at code/etc/resolver/code if it doesn't already exist by using the command  precodesudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver /code/pre     Now you should create a new file in this directory for each resolver you want to configure.  Configure with at least these two options (there are more options available):      ul   lithe name of the resolver (corresponding to the domain name)/li   lithe DNS server to be used./li   /ul      For more information about these files, see the coderesolver(5)/code manual page:      codeman 5 resolver/code      Create a new file with the same name as your new top-level domain in the code/etc/resolver//code directory and add a nameserver to it by running the following commands:      codesudo tee /etc/resolver/local &gt;/dev/null &lt;&lt;EOF/code      codenameserver 127.0.0.1/code      codeEOF/code      Here codelocal/code is the top-level domain name configured to respond to and code127.0.0.1/code is the IP address of the server to use.   I looked to see if I had that directory by default and I did not, but I did notice I had a file code/etc/resolv.conf/code which existed by default.  I have not attempted, but if the solution in the article is unsuccessful I would try using this pre-existing coderesolv.conf/code file.. under the assumption.. emit must be there for a reason/em.  <answer188352> If you have just the one Mac and the ip addresses don't change, you can bypass the whole problem and put the name/address in /etc/hosts. People forget, there was a time before DNS where we kept the hosts files synched by uucp'ing them around.  <answer191346> See https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/152892/65787 for a way to automate codesudo discoveryutil mdnsactivedirectory yes/code which forces DNS resolution of .local domains on Yosemite.
