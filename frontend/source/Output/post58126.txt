How can I downgrade Safari 6 to 5 in Mountain Lion? <body> Is it possible to downgrade Safari 6 to 5 in Mountain Lion?  I tried to install 5.1.7 but it says it only works with OS X 10.7.  Is there any workaround I can try?  <answer58128> No, you can't go back with Safari on Mountain Lion.  <answer63353> Yes you can. Follow these steps:  http://coderwall.com/p/ndm-iw  <answer63743> Sorry this answer is for downgrading Safari 6 in Lion only  Yes you can go back to Safari 5.1.7 from Safari 6. I found the uninstaller on this site. Third from the top is Safari 6 - Lion uninstaller, click this to download, run it, reboot and Safari 5.1.7 will (surprisingly) reappear, I have just done it, no problems though YMMV.  <comment70057> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57916/how-do-you-remove-safari-6-on-mac-os-x-10-7-4/59342#59342 <comment73240> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment73252> looks like this needs to be revisited as there are two examples given on how to do it where the "No you can't" answer was accepted. <comment73254> @dstarh - the best way to get an accept mark to change is making the correct answers better.  As the linked question above is about lion (which shipped with safari 5 - it's a different thing entirely than bolting on a browser that doesn't ship with a newer OS which is the case here). either way, votes and editing can show a "better" answer than even an accepted one.
