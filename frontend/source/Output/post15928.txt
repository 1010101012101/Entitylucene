Natively written packet sniffer / inspector for OS X <body> I am looking for a packet sniffer / inspector which runs natively on OS X (Cocoa) and not with some sort of compatibility layer like X.  Ideally I am looking for an application with the following qualities:  ul linative (Cocoa) interface/li liability to inspect packet data/li liinspect packet data as XML, or RAW formats/li lifree/li /ul  <answer15931> Packet Peeper is a free, native OS X application for packet sniffing. Not quite as robust as Wireshark (but what is really).  There's also Cocoa Packet Analyzer, which appears to have a nifty plugin framework for extending its capabilities, but I've never used it. It's donation-ware.  KisMAC may also be of interest. Not so much a sniffer as a wireless stumbling tool. I've used it successfully to tune my wireless network in a congested neighbourhood.  Edit: based on your updated desired features I'd say try Packet Peeper. It fulfills both your requirements.  <comment17319> "Decent" is fairly subjective; are there specific features you require of your packet sniffing program? <comment17322> why you didn't use wireshark on mac? <comment17346> @Am1rr3zA: because its not native. I have updated my question to be more specific btw. <comment17353> try tcpdump. :) 1. Free (already in you Mac), has native Cocoa (read Terminal.app) interface :), can inspect packet data and really VERY robust, can filter by any criteria, can save packet data, etc. `man tcpdump`. <comment17425> @jm666: Sounds good, will give it a shot. Very cheeky regarding Terminal.app as a cocoa app :p lol
