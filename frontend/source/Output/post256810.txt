Hide Siri from default Dock in Sierra <body> I would like to create a Dock for all users which does not include Siri. It does not appear in the file com.apple.dock.plist, so where is Siri added to the Dock?  <answer256811> I answered a similar question here: OSX 10.8 - How to keep a custom dock for all users that login  This answer should still apply to macOS Sierra.  hr  Dug up my notes from when I first modified the user template in our base images.  Ran back through the process, changing the default Dock to have about 15 items, on a fresh Mac and these steps worked.  I did a lot of this from the command line, so as to not fuss with changing/reverting permissions using Finder.  ol liArrange your Dock however you would like for it to appear on new user accounts, changing the orientation and adding/removing applications./li liBrowse to strong~/Library/Preferences/strong and copy the strongcom.apple.Dock.plist/strong file to your desktop./li liOpen Terminal and start a root session by typing: codesudo -s/code/li liEnter your current account's password when prompted/li liCopy the copy of your modified dock preference file from your desktop to the User Template in your Mac's System folder.: codecp ~/Desktop/com.apple.Dock.plist /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/Preferences/code/li /ol  That should do the trick.  I tested this on a fresh Mac by logging into both a Guest account and a new (emcreated after the above steps/em) standard user account, both accounts showed the proper Dock with 15~ items.  It shouldn't be necessary with these steps but if you run into trouble you should verify that the strong/System/Library/User Template/strong folder has permissions set to: emSystem - Read/Write/em &amp; emEveryone - No access/em.  <comment320393> The default Dock configuration file is inside the Dock.app _application bundle_, one for each language, e.g. `/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/default.plist`, however you'll need to apply the method described in Mr Rabbit's answer. <comment320394> Yes I read it, Siri is still in the dock and file and file them properly <comment320395> @Mr Rabbit , You said "_This answer should still apply to macOS Sierra._" and also said "_I tested this on a fresh Mac by logging..._" so my question to you is, did you actually test this under macOS Sierra? <comment320581> Hello yes but for edit this files I cant because I have Operation Not permitted <comment320583> Yes the `default.plist` file is protected from being modified and why using the `com.apple.dock.plist` is a possible way to go. I personally have tested Mr Rabbit's answer under macOS, however it used to work in OS X. <comment320604> Yes it's good but siri Rest in the dock <comment320605> You're going to have to articulate the situation better then "_Yes it's good but siri Rest in the dock_". <comment320607> Sorry My english is bad It's good for create a dock for all user but siri rest in the dock <comment338366> Does not work under Sierra. Just tried. Apple of course, changed something again, that prohibits how people did their job.
