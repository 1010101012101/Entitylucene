Can iOS8 QuickType show suggestions in more than one language? <body> With iOS8's new QuickType feature (predicting words you're likely to type, based on message context, learning frequently used words), is there a way to show predictions in the language of the message?  I'm frequently writing emails in English or German, depending on who I correspond with, and it would be nice if there was a way to have QuickType show suggestions based on the language I'm using in the email or message.  <answer146385> Yes, this is possible, although not automatically. There's currently no way for iOS to detect the language of the message, but you can use multiple keyboards to show predictions in a different language of your choice.  To do this, go to emSettings  General  Keyboard  Keyboards/em. This screen shows a list of keyboards set up on the device. You can use the emAdd New Keyboard.../em link at the bottom of the screen to add additional keyboards. The keyboards are ordered by language and locale (e.g. emEnglish (Australia)/em) - and there's also the emEmoji/em keyboard there, for adding smileys and other funny icons to your messages.  Depending on the keyboard, there might be multiple layouts (emQWERTZ/em, emQWERTY/em, emAZERTY/em), which can be switched from the list of selected keyboards by opening the keyboard's details.  Once you have selected an additional keyboard, you will see a new emglobe/em icon at the bottom left of the keyboard. Pressing the globe icon will switch to the next keyboard, holding the icon for a moment will show all available keyboards, and will also allow to enable/disable the predictions.  Switching to the emEnglish/em keyboard will show predictions in English language, while switching to emGerman/em will show predictions in German language. The emEmoji/em keyboard doesn't show any preditions :-)
