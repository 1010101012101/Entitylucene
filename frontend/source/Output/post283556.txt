Stubborn cookies on Sierra <body> For some reason I cannot get rid of 2 cookies in Safari. I did try terminal flush ache thing... but nothing seems to work. I had the same 2 sites (cookies) stuck on Safari in my iPhone and the only way I got rid of it was by resetting the whole phone (erased everything). So today I decided to check on my Mac and those two sites (athlete.com and gap.com) are there.  (I am not a tech person)  How do I get rid of these?  <comment357625> Thank you! Yes it was the answer I was looking for :)
