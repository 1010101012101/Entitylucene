Dropbox vs .DS_Store: prevent syncing <body> How to prevent Dropbox from syncing code.DS_Store/code files on OS X?  <answer124887> According to Dropbox's help, the code.DS_Store/code files are not synchronised.     h2Ignored files/h2      Some small system files aren't synced over Dropbox. These include:      ul   lidesktop.ini/li   lithumbs.db/li   li.ds_store/li   liicon\r/li   li.dropbox/li   li.dropbox.attr/li   /ul   If you want to manually delete all code.DS_Store/code files, OS X Daily shared a how-to guide: Delete All .DS_Store Files from Mac OS X.   <comment146146> Is this a theoretical question or are you using a specific version of dropbox client on a specific OS and seeing files actually being uploaded? <comment146163> Dropbox is no network connection in the sense of the KB-article! It does not apply there! <comment146167> Thanks Max. I have reverted the edit. <comment146197> My icons are still showing as synced on OS X. Apparently and despite the green sign, these do not show up on the web site. [ Would be good if Dropbox used a different icon for these files to avoid confusion. ] On a side note, I wonder what to do if I wanted them to be synced.
