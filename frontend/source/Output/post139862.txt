OS X Mavericks startup Apple logo location <body> Where is the gray Apple logo shown on system startup stored in OS X Mavericks? I'd like to change that image. I know there's BootXChanger that works on older versions of OS X, but it doesn't work on my Mavericks computer.  <answer139943> This post explains how to change the logo on the login screen, using a tool like Deeper. Perhaps Deeper can be used for what you are asking about?
