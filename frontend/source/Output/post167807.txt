System Preferences hangs when trying to open Display settings with an external monitor connected <body> I've searched all over for this, with no luck. So here goes:  My 2012 MacBook Pro has always played nice with my old Samsung monitor, connected with a Mini DisplayPort  VGA adapter plugged in to the Thunderbolt port. The Samsung monitor is rotated 270 degrees, and OS X has never had a problem with it.  For the last few months, System Preferences has hung every time I try to open Display preferences. The monitor still functions normally, and this hasn't been a problem.  Now I want to rearrange my monitor setup. The vertical monitor is now to the left of my laptop, but it behaves like it's to the right - because I can't change it, because Display settings hang.  I can open the settings perfectly fine when the display isn't connected - but that's fairly useless, as the arrangement tab doesn't show up.  I've tried clearing the settings with this command:  precode~ » defaults -currentHost delete com.apple.windowserver 2015-01-17 11:41:12.766 defaults[946:7994]  Domain (com.apple.windowserver) not found. Defaults have not been changed. /code/pre  Upon a reboot, the problem remains.  Any ideas?  <answer168381> So I figured this out, kind of.  I cloned and built https://github.com/CdLbB/fb-rotate, and flipped the external monitor around a couple times with it. Suddenly everything works, even after a reboot.  The only thing I can think of is that a config file somewhere got corrupted, and this utility rewrote it and fixed it.   Either way, it works now!  <comment196772> is there a problem with your Disk preferences or your user (ACL) preferences? <comment196784> @Buscar웃 Haven't had any problem with acl prefs, no idea what "Disk preferences" are. Care to explain? <comment196795> sorry, just a typo, Permissions, not preferences.
