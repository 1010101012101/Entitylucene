Confounded by permissions problem on NFS share <body> I'm setting up an NFS server (Ubuntu) to serve files to several Macs (10.7).  The way it's set up, I can log in from any Linux client and read/write over NFS exactly as expected. (I've set up ACL permissions on the server to cover multiple anonymous users and it works perfectly.)  I'm having trouble getting write permission from the Mac side, however. I've mounted the Mac Client about a million different ways, but still no dice.  I'm using the codenoowners/code option to mount, even, but that doesn't help either. (It shows the expected ownership and file permissions, and this is where I start banging my head.)  Check this out:  precodeJAF-Mac:Arlington facemyer$ pwd /Volumes/vianney3/Arlington JAF-Mac:Arlington facemyer$ users  facemyer JAF-Mac:Arlington facemyer$ groups staff com.apple.sharepoint.group.1 com.apple.sharepoint.group.2 everyone _appstore localaccounts _appserverusr admin _appserveradm _lpadmin _lpoperator _developer com.apple.access_screensharing vianneynas JAF-Mac:Arlington facemyer$ touch x touch: x: Permission denied JAF-Mac:Arlington facemyer$ ls -la total 25444 drwxrwsr-x   9 facemyer  staff      4096 Jun  6 10:40 . drwxrwsr-x  47 facemyer  staff      4096 Jun  6 10:44 .. drwxrwsr-x   7 facemyer  staff      4096 Jun  6 10:40 2011 drwxrwsr-x   4 facemyer  staff      4096 Jun  6 10:40 2012 drwxrwsr-x   4 facemyer  staff      4096 Jun  6 10:40 2013 /code/pre  The really bizarre thing is that if I su to another user I created for testing this, it works as expected for that user. (I can view and edit the files as expected.)  Please tell me I'm not going insane, and that there's a reasonable explanation here...  <answer118436> Your codenoowners/code mention solved all of my issues. I would make sure all of your options are being applied w/ codenfsstat -m/code -- mount_nfs likes to remove / add options and not list them when you just type codemount/code I also am using launchctl configuration that runs a mount_nfs command, since automount was being unpredictable. I do see an codes/code (codesetuid/code/codesetgid/code) up there in the permissions... I'm using nosuid...  Here's my working codemount_nfs/code line, you probably can remove some of the options (some are duplicates), but I feel better having all the variations for some reason ;)  precode mount_nfs -o "vers=3,noowners,nolocks,nolockd,nolock,nonlm,automounted,nosuid,hard,bg,noresvport,intr,rw,tcp,nfc"       &lt;server&gt;:/exports/myexport /Volumes/myexport /code/pre  From codels -l/code from code/Volumes/code:  precodedrwxrwrwx  13 larry  staff   4.0K Jan 17 17:37 myexport /code/pre  All folders within myexport are codedrwxrwrwx/code as well.  emIt's been an ongoing battle to get NFS and OSX working together but when it works it works flawlessly and fast. AFP is on the way out, and Apple is sticking with Samba, which has always been a pain in my neck, whether the clients are OSX or Windows, there was always some sort of issue./em  <comment109525> Hmm...tried on another Mac that I haven't yet messed with - exact same issue. Maybe I am insane, but the evidence leads me to believe otherwise. <comment137886> Have you had any progress on this? I'm running into the same issue, it seems, but ONLY when saving files from Flash CS6?? <comment138121> Sorry, nothing. I just eventually went with the Apple File System layer.
