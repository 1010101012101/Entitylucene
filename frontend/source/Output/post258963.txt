Podcast speed - Can't find adjust button <body> I have (probably accidentally) changed the speed on my podcasts, so that they are now playing at (I believe) double or 1.5 speed.  I want to change back to normal speed.  I have searched Google for some time, but every 'answer' references a speed button that it meant to be near the 'time bar'.  I can't find any speed (1x or similiar) button anywhere on the podcast screen or in podcast settings.  Help!  <answer265201> Here it isimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q0MFm.jpg" alt="![Podcasts app scrennshot"]1 In Podcasts native app this option is not very accurate, by the way.  <comment323843> Sorry - managed to find it!!
