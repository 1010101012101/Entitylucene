Photo printing from mac <body> What is the best way to print photos from Mac and pick them up manually in a local shop? In iPhoto, only option seems to be to have the pics shipped. Is there any plugin that would allow pick from local shops like Walgreens, Kodak connect, etc.,   <answer142933> How about: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drag-drop-photo-prints/id784329763?mt=12  You can use the app to print to your local Walgreens and pick up there.  <comment168394> This looks good too. I was expecting there would be an iPhoto plugin
