Prevent Wake-on-LAN when other devices wake from sleep or get connected to power <body> h3TL;DR/h3  Waking OS X computer codeA/code on the network, wakes OS X computer codeB/code. Plugging in an iOS device to charge, wakes codeB/code too. Prevent this.  h3Problem/h3  I keep my iMac in my bedroom, and just before I'm about to go to sleep I use my MacBook Pro for a while. I also connect my iPhone to the lightning connector to charge it over the night.  Both opening the MacBook Pro from sleep, emand/em putting the iPhone to charge, has the incredibly annoying behavior of waking my iMac from sleep mode. So even if I've set the iMac to sleep, if I open the lid on my MacBook or plug in the phone, my iMac wakes, and its loud fans are disturbing. I've set my iMac to sleep automatically after 30 minutes, so I always have to go up and make it go to sleep again.  Why does the iMac exhibit this behavior? How do I stop it?  I think that when an iPhone gets connected to a charger, it wakes the iMac to Wi-fi sync to iTunes. Similarly, it may be that because I have my MacBook connected to a shared iTunes library on my iMac, that might be waking the iMac – but I'm not sure yet.  hr  emNote/em: Disabling emWake for Wi-Fi network access/em under emSettings  Energy Saver/em does strongemnot/em/strong prevent this behavior, from what I have gathered.  hr  h3Temporary solution/h3  If there is anyone else having this problem, this is the quick-fix solution (SSH/VNC) I am using at the moment. There are VNC apps for iOS, and in OS X there is the native codeScreen Sharing/code application or third-party alternatives, or the plain old codeTerminal/code for remote control.   <answer245438> Disable "itunes agent" at login items   <answer245540> Under Device Backups, in iTunes 12.4.1 Preferences, there is a checkbox "Prevent iPods,iPhone &amp; iPads from syncing automatically". That should help.  <comment299666> If the iMac is connected via wifi, try going into `Settings -- Energy Saver` and uncheck *Wake for WiFi Network Access*.  See if that helps. <comment299667> @fbara Sure, but wouldn't that also prevent me from WOL when I really do need it? <comment299668> Yes, but I think that's your problem.  Plugging in your iPhone or opening your Mac is waking-up any shared service or connections causing your iMac to wake up. <comment301532> Disabling *Wake for WiFi Network Access* does not prevent this issue from occurring, strangely. <comment302565> Welcome to Ask Different.

That is a different setting than don't wake for wifi. <comment302779> @Harper That would probably prevent the problem on iPhone → Mac. But still I'm not sure why Mac → Mac wakes from sleep.
