find doesn't search within subdirectories <body> I'm using codefind . -name '*~'/code to find files that end with code~/code but it only shows files that are not in the subdirectories. When I use codefind . -name "#*"/code it shows all files including the ones that are in the subdirectories.  <answer225940> If the subdirectory is a symbolic link, codefind/code will not follow it by default. Try:  precodefind -L . -name '*~' /code/pre  See this document for more.
