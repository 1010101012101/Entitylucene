How to make Chrome open a new window for external Links <body> As some people might know, the default behavior for external links of Google Chrome is quite bad. I'm using Spaces, and opening a link in some application outside of Google Chrome while being on a different Space than the last used window of Chrome results in Chrome switching to the last focused window.  This behavior is just bad.  I want to change this behavior. On Windows, this is possible: How can you configure Chrome to open new browser instances in new windows rather than in a tab?  Sadly, I don't think this is possible on OS X Snow Leopard.  I'm already using a tool called RCDefaultApps. This is a system-control panel where I can specify default applications for different protocols. It just lacks the feature to specify additional command line arguments for the default application.  Can anyone help me there? Every hacks (aside from creating a custom Chromium build) are acceptable.  <answer9502> I've been unable to make it work too.   What I was trying to do was to use the following command:  precodeopen Google\ Chrome.app/ --new --args new-window www.google.com /code/pre  But that opens a new Chrome that instantly closes (if Chrome is already open). I was planning on wrapping the above command within a bash script and then let it have arguments (for the URL).   But since the above command failed to work, I'm still thinking about this. So far I believe it's not "possible" without some modification to Chromium, but I might be overlooking something. It's early and I haven't had coffee yet. ;)  <answer19461> You can try using the AppleScript found on this page.  I just tried it out and it perfectly works fine in Chrome 12.0.742.122.  It's extremely easy to set up:  ul lidownload the Bundle archive/li lidouble click it to unpack it/li lidouble click on codeOpenUrlInNewChromeWindow/code/li liopen Safari and set the new "Browser" as the default browser in the Preferences./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMvzP.png" alt="new default browser"  <answer117061> The --new-window command option did it for me. ("C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --new-window https://www.google.com)  <answer154591> This works on Mavericks:  precodeopen /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window https\://www.google.ca /code/pre  followed by:  precodeosascript -e 'activate application "Google Chrome"' /code/pre  Tested in sh, bash and zsh.  For some reason, if I try to put them on the same line like so:  precode/usr/bin/open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window www.google.ca; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'activate application "Google Chrome"' /code/pre  ...the second part doesn't complete.  I assume that's because it's too close on the heels of the first command.  So try this:  precode/usr/bin/open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --new --args --new-window www.google.ca; sleep 1; /usr/bin/osascript -e 'activate application "Google Chrome"' /code/pre  Note that you don't need to specify the http:// part of the url at the end for it to work, but if you do, you need to escape the colon (:).  To make this script my default browser, I created an applescript and exported it as an application and then opened Safari Preferences and set the application as my default browser.   Here's the Applescript code:  precodeon open location theURL   do shell script "/Users/[myusername]/bin/openUrlInNewChromeWindow.sh " &amp; theURL end open location /code/pre  Replace [myusername] with your actual username.  <answer207256> Starting at Dave’s answer, I found that with Chrome 45, running codeosascript/code is no longer needed, and that with OS X 10.10, the Apple Script is not selectable in the system preferences. Here is how I solved it.  Create an Apple Script using the Apple Script editor, and export it as an application.  precodeon open location theURL    do shell script "/usr/bin/open '/Applications/Google Chrome.app' --new --args --new-window " &amp; theURL end open location /code/pre  Install RC default app.     RCDefaultApp is a Mac OS X 10.2 or higher preference pane that allows a user to set the default application used for various URL schemes, file extensions, file types, MIME types, and Uniform Type Identifiers   In the system preferences, open the new default-apps screen, go to the URL tab, and set the exported Apple script as handler for emhttp/em and emhttps/em.  <comment9969> Yup, I tried that too. (with "http://google.com" instead of "Google Chrome.app") Both version don't work. <comment21766> This seems to introduce a (very short) delay before opening the window, but it's exactly what I was searching for. Thanks! <comment27348> This applescript works wonderfully. <comment136829> This is for Windows — please edit to refer to OS X. <comment181883> The reason I prefer this solution to the one by mwidmann is that this one will close after opening the URL, whereas the the other one seemed to need to stay open in order to work.  This meant that OpenUrlInNewChromeWindow was always in the CMD-Tab list of running apps, and every time I opened a URL, I had to tab twice to get back to the previous app. <comment261811> I can confirm that use of RCDefaultApp per Michael Schmid also works on OSX El Capitan (10.11.1). <comment306414> Thank you so much. This is the only solution that worked for me, this has been driving me nuts for years.
