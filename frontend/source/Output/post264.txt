iChat periodically disconnects <body> About twice a night, iChat will disconnect (though it'll still show me as connected).  After about 10 minutes, it'll realize it's disconnected and bring up a dialog telling me it lost the connection.  I can then close the dialog and reconnect with no trouble.  My computer's network connection seems to be fine throughout this.  Any idea:  ul liWhat might might be causing this?/li liHow to fix it?/li liAt least how to make it tell me more immediately when it loses the connection?/li /ul  <answer300> Your problem might be your router loosing connection temporarily to your ISP.  I use Chax, an extension to iChat which, among other great things, auto-reconnects when connection is lost. Chax is donationware.  <comment241> how are you connected to internet and server? <comment265> If you don’t rely on iChat specific features (Video/audio) I’d recommend you try adium (http://adium.im/) <comment299> As I said, the network connection is fine- I kept ping running in a terminal window and saw no loss in connection.  If it's a network issue, it'd have to be for less than a second (or affect only Aim traffic).  Chax I will check out, though. <comment471> Update: Chax is an ok workaround.  Thanks! <comment45585> Doesn't work on Lion though
