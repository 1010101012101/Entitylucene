I dont want to remove the application completely, but I dont want it to launch automatically at startup.  <answer184794> Try System Prefs  User &amp; Groups  Your name  Login Items.  Select it in the list &amp; click the - button underneath  If it's not listed there, then check either code/Library/LaunchDaemons//code or code/Library/StartupItems//code to see whether it has an entry in there.br It's safe to remove items from there - though they will continue running until the next reboot.    If you want to be able to restore functionality in future, zip the file in situ then trash the original.  <comment219123> is it in your settings to start up at boot? <comment219536> Thx you so much.
