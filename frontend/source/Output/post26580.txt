Resize and position windows using keyboard shortcuts <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   What Window Management Options exist for OS X?       I want to be able to resize and move a window without using a mouse.   Recently I found shiftit, which is 80% what I need. The only thing it is missing is the window resize. And it is not updated since 2010 :( .  Is there a better alternative?  <answer26581> Have you considered Moom http://manytricks.com/moom/ or MercuryMover http://www.heliumfoot.com/mercurymover/ ?  <answer26585> I use and love Divvy.  You can define grid layouts and hotkeys to invoke them.  http://mizage.com/divvy/  <comment30310> You may find something suitable in the answers to [What Window Management Options exist for OS X?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9659/what-window-management-options-exist-for-os-x).
