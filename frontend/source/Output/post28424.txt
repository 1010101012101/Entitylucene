Trouble setting up Wifi on an iPhone 4S <body> Just bought a new iPhone 4S (64GB). Like virtually every other early Apple product I've owned in the past few years, I'm having trouble setting up the networking. At my home, all's well with a 802.11b router, same at the hotel I'm currently in. But when I go to my office, it refuses to get a connection to the G router there. It sees the network ok, but when I select the appropriate network, it asks for the password but won't connect when I enter it.  I've tried everything I've done in the past (power off the device, power off the router, reset the network setting on the phone), and nothing seems to work.  Any suggestions?  <comment32684> Maybe the router in the office restricts access by MAC adress? <comment32846> No. Its not restricting access. There's just a WPA2 password.
