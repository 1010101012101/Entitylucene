Create hybrid MBR/GPT just like Bootcamp Assistant does <body> Currently I have two partitions with data on them I would like to keep (marked with a *):  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *250.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh SSD*          164.2 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Additional_Storage*      56.6 GB   disk0s4    5:       Microsoft Basic Data                          28.4 GB   disk0s5 /code/pre  Now I would like to install Windows on /dev/disk0s5. However, since the partition is GPT Windows cannot be installed. Is there a way to create my own MBR/GPT hybrid like the Bootcamp-Assistant does? /dev/disk0s5 would then be MBR and the rest still GPT.

When I booted into recovery mode, I could open the terminal and run code./gptsync /dev/disk0/code. This created a hybrid MBR/GPT and allowed me to install Windows.  <answer236544> The problem is not that you don't have an MBR.  The problem is that an MBR can only have 4 partition entries.  On an out-of-the-box fresh install of OS X, you'd be using 3 of those partition entries already; one for the EFI partition, one for the Mac HFS partition, and one for the recovery partition.  That leaves only one MBR slot available for the Boot Camp Assistant to work with in order to install Windows.  In your situation, you have an additional Data partition called "Additional Storage" that is taking up the 4th slot.  Since your Windows partition is the 5th partition on the disk, the MBR cannot handle this, nor does the Boot Camp Assistant know what to do in this scenario, so it refuses to work.  The solution is to manually use codefdisk/code to make your partition table look like this:  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0    geometry: 30401/255/63 [488397168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: EE 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [         1 -     409639] &lt;Unknown ID&gt;  2: AF 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  320702320] HFS+  3: AB 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 322381824 -  110616584] HFS+  4: 07 1023 254  63 - 1023 254  63 [ 433000448 -   55396352] HPFS/QNX/AUX /code/pre  What I have done here is used the sector numbers from your output of the codegpt/code command to show you what your MBR partition table should look like.  If you look closely, I have omitted the recovery partition from the table (since it's generally useless and you'd likely want to access your Additional Storage partition while running Windows).  To make these changes, use codefdisk -e /dev/disk0/code to enter codefdisk/code in interactive mode.  You can issue a code?/code command to get a list of the available commands you'll need to do the modifications.  Also, when codefdisk/code asks you if you want to edit in CHS mode, say no.  Don't worry about the codecyl/hd/sec/code values.  They won't have the same numbers for you as they do in my table above, but it doesn't matter.  hr  strongA few words of warning here:/strongbr This layout is horribly unsupported by both Apple and Windows. Having the GPT and MBR partition tables disagree with each other is an error as far as OS X is concerned, and there is a 650MB gap between partitions 2 and 3 as far as Windows is concerned.  ol listrongDo not EVER under ANY circumstances/strong use any partitioning tools to adjust/repartition your disk from this point on.  Best case scenario: it'd just give you an error.  Worst case scenario: it'd destroy the entire disk./li liMake sure you do not use Disk Utility to "repair" your disk. Always make sure you have a partition selected when doing First Aid, not the disk itself./li liDo not use whole-disk encryption software (BitLocker or FileVault). These require additional support partitions and will attempt to repartition the drive./li liDo not convert your disks to Dynamic (Windows) or CoreStorage (Mac) volumes.  These will modify the partition tables also./li /ol  <answer274141> You can use following guide http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/hybrid.html and choose only the entries 2 and 5 from the GPT table to build the hybrid MBR.  <comment289229> An (Apple) GUID partition scheme always contains an MBR also. It's a pMBR though. Your question relies on a misconception and should be revised partly. <comment289230> @klanomath I thought the Bootcamp Assistant creates a MBR/GPT hybrid. Is this not the case? I am looking for something like this: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/9839/how-to-manually-partition-boot-camp-your-mac-for-windows-7/ <comment289231> You may add disk0s5 with `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` to the MBR but it will not vanish from the GUID partition table - adding a partition to the MBR is not mutually exclusive of being part of the GUID. <comment289232> @klanomath Would this allow Windows to see the disk as MBR instead of GPT? <comment289237> Please add the output of `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` and `sudo gpt -r show /dev/disk0` to your question. <comment289238> You said, "_However, since the partition is GPT Windows cannot be installed._", what version of Windows are you trying to install. I though Windows 7 and later can be installed using a GPT. <comment289239> @user3439894 Windows 8.1, you are correct but only in EFI mode and on my mac I cannot install Windows on EFI mode or else the graphics driver crashes. <comment289243> @klanomath Added. <comment289263> Welcome to Ask Different!
