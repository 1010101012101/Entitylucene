Vmware Fusion, how to remove suspend option completely <body> I have good number of virtual XP and W7 machines on our domain, one thing always cause problems when multiple users are using the same machine.  There's always that one person whom put the vm session on suspend instead of shutdown.  I know to change under preferences, but somehow users change default back to suspend.  Is there a way to enforce shutdown only.  this is the case for Fusion 5, 6.  thanks.   <answer105763> From Disabling the suspend feature for a virtual machine in VMware Fusion:     strongVMware Fusion/strong      To disable the suspend feature for a virtual machine:      ol   liShutdown the virtual machine./li   liLocate the virtual machine bundle.
