How can I copy/sync SMS messages between iPhones <body> Is there a way (built in or 3rd party) to sync SMS messages (not iMessages) between 2 iPhones?  The scenario is that I have an old iPhone and a new iPhone that is already configured. Because of this I don't want to use the method of restoring a backup of the old iPhone onto the new iPhone. I'm primarily looking for a way to get the messages from the old phone onto the new phone, rather than keep them in sync.  One possible limitation is that the old iPhone is an iPhone 4 so is only running 7.1.2  <answer210257> No. The sandbox that contains app data prevents this as does the restore wiping instead of merging data functionality you are already aware of.  ul liYou can back one phone up and restore it to the other./li liYou can use iMessage to sync things in a forward direction ( new messages can sync well )/li liYou can use a tool like Phoneview to export all the messages from multiple devices and collate / combine / preserve them on your Mac. /li /ul  Some commercial transfer products and apps claim to do this, but I haven't seen anything consumer focused on the App Store to do this transfer or merge without jail breaking the device you want to do the "merge" - perhaps someone is more clever or informed and has a "yes" solution.   <comment253744> Whole bunch of suggestions for export here - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/6900/how-can-i-export-sms-text-messages-from-my-iphone?rq=1 - but no-one mentions import <comment253752> I'm interested in your second bullet point if you wouldn't mind clarifying that. Would I be able to move over my current text messages to my new device? I don't have any messages on the new phone, just don't want to reset the configuration and apps I've already set up <comment253753> No joy there @MatthewSteeples from my experience. iMessage doesn't seem to reach backwards to sync data.  If you were to sign into iMessage on both devices, and try using them for a week you might get enough history that you might be happy moving forward with that solution
