g++ compiler not working after 10.9.5 update! <body> I recently updated mac to 10.9.5, and while compiling a c++ source file i get these errors  precodeAdityas-MacBook-Air% g++ q3.cpp ld: can't write output file: a.out for architecture x86_64 clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation) /code/pre  Please help me out here, why does this happen so often with mac!!  <comment181512> Seems that there is a permission issue. I meant, have you got write permissions on the folder where a.out will be write? <comment181513> UPDATE!! this happens only to the .cpp files in ~/ directory <comment181515> Try `export ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64'` and then recompile.
