Reply button not working <body> I have a MacBook Pro, which uses Safari as the web browser. When I check my company's e-mail online, I cannot use the Reply button (it simply does not respond.)  I wonder what I should do to fix this problem. (My computer is new.)  <answer4329> Does anything else not work, or is it just the “Reply” button? A few things you could try:  ul listrongRestart Safari/strong—or your computer. Sounds dumb, but it's amazing how often this does the trick./li liUse the menu item “Safari - Empty Cache…” to strongclear Safari’s cache/strong./li liTry to use your company’s webmail strongin another browser/strong. There may be a subtle bug (or feature?) in the website’s code that Safari is not handling properly. Here are a few alternatives: ul liMozilla Firefox/li liGoogle Chrome/li liOpera/li liOmniWeb/li liCamino/li liInternet Explorer, on Windows, just to check. Even in this day and age, some websites still only work properly with IE./li liNetscape Navigator (Yuk yuk yuk. Just kidding, don’t download this. For the love of God, don’t download this.)/li /ul/li /ul  <answer4333> Ok. I figured out. It is that the Block Pop-up Window that was checked.  <comment4156> Does it work in other browsers? <comment4159> @mipadi.The computer has only one browser. I have not downloaded any other. <comment4186> Oh, does it pop up a new window for you to compose your message in? <comment4189> Yes. I uncheck the botton and it works now. Thanks.
