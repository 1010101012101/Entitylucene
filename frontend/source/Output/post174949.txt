How to cycle through recently *used* tabs in Safari? <body> I want to cycle through recently strongemused/em/strong tabs in Safari 7.1.3 (MacOS 10.9.5) like one can in in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. I predominantly run Opera 11.64, and it exhibits the best behavior for this recently-used-tab switching. Is there a way to do this in Safari, even if it requires an extension/plugin/addon of some kind?  Note: cycling/switching between tabs in most-recently-used (aka "visited") order is different than simply cycling through all the tabs as they are listed at the top of the browser; the latter seems more-commonly discussed.  <comment371759> Interested in getting an answer to this one as well. Should be a must have for every browser!
