Where is my ./configure file in OSX 10.8.4 (Mountain Lion)? <body> I'm setting up Cap'n Pro on my Mac and the install instructions ask me to type the following in terminal:  precode./configure CXX=$HOME/clang-3.2/bin/clang++ /code/pre  I look in my user folder i.e. ~/./configure but it doesn't exist. Am I doing this right? Where is my ./configure folder? Do I need to create one?   Also, yes I have invisible folders visible.  <answer99465> The codeconfigure/code script (not directory) is part of the source code archive you should have downloaded (codecapnproto-c++-X.Y.Z.tar.gz/code).  When you unpack that archive, change to the toplevel directory (codecapnproto-X-Y-Z/code) and run the configure command.  precode$ cd [to where you downloaded the archive] $ tar xzf capnproto-c++-X.Y.Z.tar.gz $ cd capnproto-c++-X.Y.Z $ ./configure CXX=$HOME/clang-3.2/bin/clang++ /code/pre  Then run the subsequent commands (codemake/code and codesudo make install/code) from that same directory.  This is rather generic - most autotool-based builds work exactly like that.
