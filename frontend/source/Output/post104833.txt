Wake on LAN with iMac <body> Which iMac models support wake on LAN (ethernet)? I've enabled "Wake for Administrator Access" but I can't wake up the Mac from Off or Sleep states. I'm using my tried-and-true tomato firmware which wakes up my windows devices just fine.  <comment123338> To answer your question better, please provide the model you have and more importantly, the version of OS X you're using. <comment123366> Did you enable "wake on network access" in "Energy saver" ? Is you computer connected through ethernet or wifi ? (Wake from off state won't work).
