What to do about an erratic trackpad on a MBP? <body> My 13-inch mid-2010 Macbook Pro is having all of the symptoms described in this Ask Metafilter discussion thread from 2012:     As of this morning, the touchpad acts extraordinarily erratic. moving my cursor, the pad seemingly cannot tell whether I am using one, two or three fingers, leading to unintentional swiping and pulling up the dashboard, etc. But it does this when nothing is touching it or nearby as well....     As in the linked discussion, it's pretty hot and humid here, and I suspect that  it could  be caused by condensation inside the case (as was suggested in one of the comments on that thread).  My question is:  What do I emdo/em about this?  Right now I'm using an attached USB mouse and keyboard, but I need a better solution.  Is there a way to draw out the moisture that I suspect is the culprit?  (Go ahead, tell me to bury it in rice...)
