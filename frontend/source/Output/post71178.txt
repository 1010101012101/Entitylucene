How to quickly remove all useless iOS applications on my Mac? <body> I have 900 apps on my Mac because I sync both my iPhone and iPad.   There are a lot of apps that I deleted a long time ago which are useless. I have amassed 40gb of apps.  Is there a quick way to delete all the useless apps?  <answer71179> You could right click on any app in iTunes codeApps/code section, click codeShow in Finder/code, then sort by codeDate Modified/code and erase all those that haven't been updated in a long time and that you don't use. Be careful because one of your preferred app might not have been updated recently.
