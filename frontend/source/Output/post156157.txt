Diff between diskutility and finder on free space <body> I came across this today :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S2kUQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  At first I was like : "Caching bastard." but no... The finder is right and the diskutil is wrong... Why ?  <answer156165> The reason is probably that you have local snapshots of time machine backups (http://support.apple.com/en-us/ht4878). The difference is that the Finder calculates the free space you can use (the backups would be deleted if necessary). They are stored at /.MobileBackups (at least that's what it has been in Mavericks iirc) if you want to have a look and verify how much space it is consuming.  Other possible causes:  ul lisome people claim that if you have disk encryption enabled those values may differ /li limaybe Disk Utility was opened before you removed some files and didn't refresh?/li /ul  <comment183669> Can you check whether http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70983/large-difference-in-reported-free-disk-space or http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47647/how-to-fix-disk-utility-about-this-mac-and-finder-that-disagree-on-hard-drive solve your problem? <comment183670> @patrix I'll learn how to search.
