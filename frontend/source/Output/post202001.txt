Change default app for magnet links in Safari <body> Currently Safari opens magnet links in Bittorrent. I'm moving to Deluge and I want to change the association.  I can't find anything in the preferences of either program to change the association, but I thought that it would be somewhere in strongcom.apple.launchservices.secure.plist/strong. Searching that plist file, I can't find any mention of magnets or bittorrent...  Where is this association recorded and how can I change it?  <answer202008> I use RCDefaultApp to change things  such as this when there is not a direct preference that can be set in a given app.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JNra5.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment243600> Yeah I saw that app and it looks good but I'm also curious to know how to do it manually. If I can't get an answer on that I'll probably go with this solution. <comment265895> Still works under Mavericks <comment271776> Nice recommendation!  A friend of mine needed this - Thanks <comment271802> You're right ;) was pretty busy at the time .. Upvote set ^ <comment361399> This works fine on MacOS Sierra :-)
