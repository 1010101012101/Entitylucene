How to see crash log on iPad 5.1.1 <body> How can I see crash log on original iPad?  <comment142616> If you have a Mac, plug it into your Mac and sync with iTunes. The logs will sync over and be viewable in the Console.app. No idea how to view logs via Windows <comment142628> Do you want to look into the logs on the iPad itself or on your computer? If on computer, are you looking for an OSX or a Windows solution? <comment142645> Several answered questions should cover this.
