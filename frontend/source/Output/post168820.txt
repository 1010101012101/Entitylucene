Where does Thunderbird, on OSX, store its offline folders? <body> I marked my Sent folder to be used in offline mode, and asked the messages to be downloaded. I saw the status bar show my messages being downloaded.   But I can't figure out where the messages were stored.  My profile folder doesn't have any new files, nor any that start with the word codeSent/code:  precode~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/l5z5ge4s.default/Mail# ls -l Local\ Folder # Nothing here named Sent.msf, or Sent.sbd /code/pre  Where should I look for my downloaded messages?  <answer168821> I'd say you are looking at the right place.  I've configured Thunderbird to use IMAP to sync with Gmail. In that scenario, my sent emails are located at  precode/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;randomcharacters&gt;.default/ImapMail/imap.googlemail.com/\[Gmail\].sbd/Sent\ Mail /code/pre  This SuperUser answer has a screenshot which shows how to look up the location for a particular account:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRAPu.png" alt="enter image description here"
