How to downgrade software using terminal? <body> New apple user here, I am trying to downgrade matplotlib to 1.3.1 after coming to this potential solution:  https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/3470/  I just have no idea how to do that.  <answer159995> Try this way:  precodepip uninstall matplotlib pip install matplotlib==1.3.1 /code/pre  <comment188077> It depends on how you installed it in the first place. A naive solution would be to uninstall, then install the older version.
