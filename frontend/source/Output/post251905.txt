How to extract clips from 4k MOV file <body> I have some lengthy 4k drone footage and just 10-20 GB of free storage on my Mac (OS X 10.11).   I want to extract and save the best clips from the raw footage, keeping as close to the raw format before deleting the much-larger original video files.  I'll be importing the footage into iMovie for editing.  Why not just make clips in iMovie?  Apparently there's no way to discard the unused footage from disk until the entire project is finalized. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5501532?tstart=0  I also tried Quicktime, but after making clips, I only see how to export/save in 1080p resolution. https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22605?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  I'm not seeing an obvious app store choice for this singular task. I don't care about the file container if it ends up .MOV, .MP4, or whatever as long as iMovie will open it.  But I'm hoping the solution will not require decoding and re-encoding with a command line tool like ffmpegx.  <comment313244> You're going to need to find some more storage space. There's really no way around it.
