2 month old MacBook pro 2015 full charge capacity deceased to 91%. Is this normal? <body> My new MacBook pro 2015 model shows me full charge capacity of 6180 mAh where as the designed capacity is 6559 mAh. I use Coconut battery app to keep track of the charging cycles and capacity and I noticed the battery capacity is low since 18th cycle.   Is this normal, I tried battery calibration by completely depleting battery and then charging it again to 100%.
