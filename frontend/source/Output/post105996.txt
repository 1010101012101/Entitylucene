iTunes doesn't start <body> When I try to open my iTunes on Windows 7 it opens in the Podcasts section and asks for a Userid/Pass for trancemix.org. This was a free Podcast I subscribed to last time I used iTunes. When I cancel the Login request my iTunes Hangs and I am forced to kill it. Is there a way via command line I can unsubscribe this Podcast Or any other way to get rid of this error.

You can also do this by going to the strongFile  Add Folder to Library.../strong menu option and choosing the folders./li /ol
