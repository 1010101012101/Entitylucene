Dock and Menu Bar Disappear in OS X El Capitan When in App Window <body> I have a Macbook Pro 11,1 running OS X El Captian. Recently, whenever in an application such as Firefox my menu bar and dock disappear. This is really annoying, as in system preferences both my dock &amp; menu bar are set to not autohide. If I click the desktop, suddenly the dock and menu bar pop back up.  Any suggestions?  <answer222546> It turns out this is a bug with Firefox. These instructions I found fixed the issue.     ol   liIn Finder right click on the Firefox app and select “Show Package Contents”/li   liNavigate to Contents and open “Info.plist” in TextEdit./li   liIn this file, near the top, there should be a piece of text that says &lt; dict , underneath this add the following making sure all of the   text is present./li   /ol   emLSUIPresentationMode 0/em     ol start="4"   liSave that file/li   liRestart Firefox/li   liHappy browsing again/li   /ol   src: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3096551?tstart=0  <comment269517> Does the Firefox menu bar disappear as well? Are you running Firefox in Fullscreen-Mode? What happens if you just move the mouse to the top of the screen (with Firefox still the active application)? <comment269530> I believe it's a bug. What are you doing specifically when it disappears? I have the same issue when watching videos driven by the silverlight player.
