Remove preferences and application support files from already uninstalled apps <body> I want to remove preferences and application support files from already uninstalled apps.  I have app cleaner to remove those files when I delete the application, but that only works for stuff after I installed App Cleaner.  Any automated system for programs removed before I installed App Cleaner?  <answer126536> h2CleanMyMac 2/h2  CleanMyMac 2 has an Uninstaller feature that includes the ability to remove leftovers from uninstalled applications.     strongNo more Leftovers/strongbr   If you used to uninstall applications by dragging them to Trash, then you have tons of apps leftovers! Find and remove them using CleanMyMac2.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LAhzd.jpg" alt="Uninstaller â†’ Leftovers"  <comment148254> That is exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!
