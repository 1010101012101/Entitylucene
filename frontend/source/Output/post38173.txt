How do I simply import mini-DV content onto a Mac? <body> I have a number of old mini-DV tapes that I would like to import into my Macbook.  All I want to do is for an app to read the contents of the tape and produce a single MP4 combining all of the clips on the tape or multiple MP4 files of the separate clips on the tape.  I tried using iMovie for the fist time and found it to be overkill for what I need.  It imported the contents of my tape as multiple .dv files and then I have to create a project.  I don't want to deal with that.  I simply want to import the content of tapes and store it on a drive so that I can watch the content on Macs/Windows/Linux/multiple-platforms.  <answer38175> Connect your camcorder and use iMovie HD to import the tape, then export using ShareQuicktime. It will create one file out of the tape.  Edit: In response to Sajee's comment below.  Choose ShareQuicktimeCompress movie for: Full Quality. As implied, there won't be any loss of quality.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TGvYy.png" alt="Share&gt;Quicktime&gt;Compress movie for: Full Quality"  <answer38178> I have an older Canon Mini-DV camera and the process was quite painless when I brought the video in to my Mac.  ol liObtain the necessary firewire cable to connect your camera to your Mac. Honestly, this was the hardest part for me./li liMake sure the camera is plugged in to the wall (you don't want the battery dying during import) and the tape is in the camera and set to the start of the tape./li liTurn on the camera, turn on your Mac./li liConnect the camera to your Mac via the firewire cable./li /ol  The Mac will open up an import dialog when you connect the camera and ask if you want to import the video in to iMovie. Say yes and iMovie's import feature will take over. It will start the video play back on your camera and you'll see it saving the video content to disk on your Mac. IIRC the import was real time (or very near too it), which is unfortunate. But really it was that simple.  <answer100453> There's a new Mac app ($19 on the Mac app store) that simplifies the import and saving of MiniDV tapes.  Here it is:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lifeflix/id630212114?mt=12  <answer121001> I had this problem and this is how I solved it:  ol liConnect camera to iMovie (firewire in my case)./li liOn the camera press PLAY./li liWait until it starts playing in the iMovie window./li liClick codeImport/code in the iMovie window./li /ol  <comment43244> I saw this option but will there be a loss in quality during the Export process?  I would like to maintain 100% quality, regardless of how much disk space it takes. <comment43253> @Sajee See my updated answer. <comment65379> @Sajee Did this work for you? If not, let me know what's not working! <comment132278> MBP (10.5.8) did not detect the camera (Sony DCR-TRV7). I used the Firewire (4 in the camera to 8 in the MBP) connector that came with the camera. System Profiler did not recognize the camera.
