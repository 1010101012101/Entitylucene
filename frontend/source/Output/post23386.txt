"Could not find RubyGem rails" on 10.7.1 Server <body> I just cannot get Rails to work on my 10.7.1 Server installation. After having run codeCC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 gem install rails --force/code as root, I still get this:  precode% rails /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:777:in `report_activate_error': Could not find RubyGem rails (&gt;= 0) (Gem::LoadError)   from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:211:in `activate'   from /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb:1056:in `gem'   from /usr/bin/rails:18 /code/pre  RVM doesn't appear to be producing a working install either.  To cap it all, this lack of Rails is preventing Profile Manager from running.  Does anybody know what could be going wrong here? I've tried a clean install of 10.7 (not Server, though) on another machine, and Rails runs fine in that. I'm not particularly keen on nuking and reinstalling my main system, though!  <answer23415> Try upgrading rubygems or try uninstalling rails and installing back again using gems.   precodegem update --system  gem uninstall rails gem install rails /code/pre   <comment26101> try upgrading rubygems or try uninstalling rails and installing using gem  gem update --system ; gem uninstall rails; gem install rails <comment26120> Thanks â€” that seems to have fixed things. If you put that as an answer rather than a comment I can mark it as accepted.
