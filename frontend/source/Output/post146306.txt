Connecting iPad to a USB powered monitor? <body> I'm thinking about buying a USB powered monitor to connect to my MacBook.   I found so many nice ones and the most suitable was Asus.   ASUS MB MB168B+ 15.6-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor   Now that got me wondering if I can also connect my iPad somehow to watch a movie or display something for a client that would be very useful.  I tried looking up anything remotely related to the subject but failed and thats why I'm here asking the experts.  supJailbroken iPad mini 2 and MacBook Air 11â€³/sup  <answer146313> The iPad does not support video output over USB; it's a limitation you cannot work around with a jailbreak. Your only options are composite and VGA  video output via supported Lightening adaptors. There are jailbreaks that allow you to output the video 100% of the time though, not just from apps that support mirroring.  <comment172381> what is the Asus model? <comment172384> ASUS MB MB168B+ 15.6-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor <comment172392> Did you look where would you connect it on your iPad, or what is the MBA purpose in this? <comment172396> it doesn't connect straight away thats my question.. <comment172574> I don't understand why my comments here keep getting deleted!!?? <comment172576> Because they add nothing to the answer.
