Random contacts not syncing with Google <body> I have my iphone set up to sync contacts with Google. It works fine, for the most part. However, there are some contact cards that are not synced. I can find no rhyme or reason to why these are not synced yet others are.  Any ideas?  <answer252557> Go to Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars and check if your Google account is set as the default for contacts:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yklyZ.jpg" alt="default contacts account iOS"  For local contacts (not on Google) an option would be to export them from your phone, send them to yourself via mail, and import them to your Google account, as it appears that you cannot change a contact from one group / account to another directly on iOS.  <comment314227> They appear on https://www.google.com/contacts/ but not on your phone? or is it the other way around? On which group on the Google website? <comment314238> They appear on my phone, but not on google.com/contacts. I don't understand what you mean by which group on the Google website since they don't appear there at all. <comment314465> Yes, I verified those settings before posting. <comment314589> Are iCloud contacts on or off? <comment314598> ICloud contacts are off. <comment314600> I can't easily reproduce your problem, do you know the origin of this non syncing contacts? What happens if you create a contact by hand on iOS, does it sync to Google? <comment314602> Yes, newly created contacts sync. I've talked my brain trying to find some common trait among the non-syncing contacts. The only thing I can come up with I'd most, but not all, are contacts from my work. But, I don't have a separate contacts group for those. <comment314719> Were those contacts ever on Google, or did they came from another phone? How did you load them on iOS? <comment314720> I don't know if any have ever been on google. Most, but not all were originally shafted with me by my  predecessor at my job.
