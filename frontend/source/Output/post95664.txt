How do I use Mathias .osx defaults? <body> I just got a mac and am still familiarizing myself with it. I was taking a look at: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx  Not sure how to use it!  <comment112246> Select settings that look interesting, paste them in a terminal, and then quit and reopen applications to try them out. <comment112303> Oh that's all? Cool thanks.
