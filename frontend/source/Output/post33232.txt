Where is the system wide PATH shell variable set in OS X? <body> I'd like to set the codePATH/code shell variable for all users, but could not find where it is defined.  Having no codeexport PATH/code in my code.bash_profile/code, I have this:  precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/X11/bin /code/pre  Where is this the codePATH/code shell variable defined?  <answer33245> Well, if you really wanted to OVERWRITE the path, you could just set the new one in /etc/launchd.conf.  There is a similar question here.  <answer33246> On a shell level, the codePATH/code variable is set in /etc/profile by calling code/usr/libexec/path_helper/code. To add your own paths, you can add files with a path in it to code/etc/paths.d//code:  precodepse@Fourecks:~$ ll /etc/paths.d total 8 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  13 Jul 22 07:02 50-X11 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  12 Aug 13 14:12 TeX pse@Fourecks:~$ cat /etc/paths.d/TeX  /Library/TeX/texbin /code/pre  That's the safer way than editing code/etc/profile/code, code/etc/paths/code or any other system-provided file which may get overwritten with the next OSX upgrade.
