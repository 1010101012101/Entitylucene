Running applications off a secondary device? <body> I am wondering if such a device exists that connects to your macs drive and can host dense applications (like after effects, maya, logic pro, final cut, etc) and run them from the device when connected to your computer.  I'm not talking about just an external hard drive, but more so like a computer extension. I am aware of other options like relocating non-application data to a hard drive or upgrading my hard drive, but am specifically asking if anyone knows of such a device or workaround?  <comment332581> Do you want more hard drive space AND more computing power or just more computing power or just more hard drive space?
