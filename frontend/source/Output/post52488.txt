History of downloaded iBookstore samples? <body> For some reason—presumably a sync by my iPhone that overwrote my iPad’s more recently downloaded library—the majority of my iBooks were deleted.  The books I purchased can easily be restored, but I had downloaded a embunch/em of samples to, well, sample, before I bought the books.  Shy of using the restore feature, which will probably wreak its own havoc the way my iPhone did, when I synchronized iCloud through it, is there any log or history of the samples I have downloaded? I am sure this will happen again, and I don’t think restoring your iPad is the intended user experience by Apple.  <answer52513> I'm afraid no such log or history exist.   Apparently either restoring a device, as iTunes does not make a backUp of your sample books, or upgrading to the lastest version of iBooks, will make your samples to dissappear.   <answer76234> I was able to recover the list of all books in iBooks, including sample chapters, with the following steps:  ul liSelect a tool to parse iPhone/iPad backups on your hard drive. Google for "iphone backup extractor", there are various./li liSelect a recent iPhone/iPad backup from the list presented by your extractor software./li liSelect iBooks as the app you wish to extract./li liSearch for a file called codeiBooks_v10252011_2152.sqlite/code, or something like that./li liUse a SQLite viewer (such as Base on the Mac) to view the codeZBKBOOKINFO/code table./li liLook for the codeZBOOKTITLE/code field - this should contain a list of all your books, including sample chapters, from the time of the backup!/li liIf you want to get fancy, try sorting on the codeZSAMPLECONTENT/code field./li /ul  <comment60086> Thanks. It’s weird how iBook still remembers the collections the books are in, and the last-read position, though.
