Sequential numbering for pseudo-"Rows" <body> strongtl;dr:/strong Formula to number rows that doesn't break when some "rows" are made of multiple, merged spreadsheet rows.  strongScenario:/strong I am making a check-list (of things to look at when apartment-hunting) in Numbers 3 that involves some "nesting" by merging cells. It's more efficient to show than explain, so here's a little dummy:  precode  ||  A  |   B    |    C   |    D   |   E ----------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- 1 ||  #  |      Item       |  Apt1  |  Apt2 ----------------------------------------------- 2 ||  1  |   Sink works    |  [√]   |  [√]  ----------------------------------------------- 3 ||     |        |  Heat  |  [√]   |  [√]  ----     -        ----------------------------- 4 ||  2  |  Has   |  A/C   |  [√]   |  [√]  ----     -        ----------------------------- 5 ||     |        |  Gas   |  [√]   |  [√]  ----------------------------------------------- 6 ||  3  |   Door locks    |  [√]   |  [√]  /code/pre  strongProblem:/strong Normal ways of putting in a row number break because of the way Numbers handles merged cells. For example, codeA6=SUM(A5,1)/code would return 1, because Numbers thinks codeA5/code and codeA4/code are empty (whereas codeA3/code contains 2).  <answer130454> Using way more math than should be needed, there is a formula that works. In the dummy spreadsheet above, you would put this in codeA3/code and then copy it into all subsequent rows in bulk, just as you'd expect:  precode1 + ((    SQRT(8*SUM(  OFFSET($A$2,0,0,SUM(ROW(),-2),1)  )+1)    - 1) ÷ 2) /code/pre  <comment152894> I think I have a solution: `1 + ((    SQRT(8*SUM(  OFFSET($A$2,0,0,SUM(ROW(),-2),1)  )+1)    - 1) ÷ 2)`
