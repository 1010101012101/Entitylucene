Why are contacts synced between our two phones? <body> I had a iPhone 4 and after 2 years got an iPhone 5. I gave my wife the 4 and we share contacts if I add one it goes to her phone if I delete hers on my phone it delete from her phone too.   How can we prevent this from happening?  <answer131898> Both Phones have the same iCloud account set up. Every person should have a unique iCloud account.  <comment154979> You don't have a question hereâ€”are you trying to prevent this from happening?
