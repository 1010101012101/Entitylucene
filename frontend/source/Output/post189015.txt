How does FileVault 2 recovery key stored in iCloud work? <body> When requested during the full disk encryption process, one option is to store the recovery key in your iCloud account.    I stored mine in iCloud, but frankly I'm confused as when I look at the drive contents I see NO files even indicating a recovery key.  So what exactly is happening?  Also, how is this used during the recovery process?  Also, if you put your recovery key in iCloud, how is more than one device handled (i.e. macbooks)?  <comment223913> The first part of your question is  rather opinion based. Do you trust Apple? <comment223914> True, but being a Mac Newbie, I'm not in full understanding of how the iCloud option really works. <comment223916> So maybe you should ask that instead? <comment224026> Even if the recovery key is accessible via iCloud Drive (would be extremely surprised if it was) and not just stored somewhere on Apple's server attached to your overall iCloud account, it would be a hidden file. Hidden files are not visible in Finder or really anywhere on your Mac, unless you take specific actions to [enable viewing them](http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/how-show-hidden-files-in-mac-os-x-finder-3520878/). (The only exception is in Terminal, if you use `ls -a` instead of just `ls` to list a directory's contents.)
