How to check if someone else has blocked me? <body> For various reasons, I believe that someone has blocked me in iMessage, but I am not 100% sure.  Right now, it shows the message is delivered.  Is there a way to see if they blocked me, or if they have just not read it yet?  <answer177473> There currently is no definite way to tell.  However, if a person does not respond after a long period of time, they most likely have blocked you.  <comment202784> The whole idea of blocking is that you never know. They might just have switched off 'read receipts' <comment203803> @Tetsujin True. I was hoping there was a definite way to figure it out, but I guess not. <comment209976> Or they're just ignoring you, with similar effect to blocking. <comment309955> So the messages will deliver? <comment309968> @User Yup, correct. <comment309982> I think when people block each other, messages send as SMS.
