Consolidating music from three drives to one <body> I am trying to consolidate my music and videos on my Laptop. It is in 3 places:  ul liC:\Users\RajMore\Music/li liD:\Entertainment\Audio/li liE:\Entertainment\Audio/li /ul  I want to put all the music in a single location codeC:\Users\RajMore\Music/code so that I can carry a single laptop and not have to worry about taking my External HDD or having to remove the D drive to put in my DVD drive.  I have just about 60 GB of music. 10 GB on C, 20 G on D and 30 GB on E. I have 86 GB free on C, so space is not at a premium.  Metadata is the stuff about the music / video that is not stored in the music / video item - it is stored in ITunes.  For example: Start of song, end of song, rating (I use this when for good songs to DJ), video start time and end time etc.  How do I do this and not lose metadata regarding the music and videos?  <answer1372> Under Prefs  Advanced set the Media Folder to your chosen location on C:  Then, File Menu  Library SubMenu  Organize Library.  Select "Consolidate Files".  <comment1167> Do you mean iTunes and is the metadata just in the files(e.g. mp3s) or in some other sytem? <comment1168> @Mark: Question edited for your comment <comment1170> metadata stored in music not in iTunes,you just have problem in rating and number of play.
