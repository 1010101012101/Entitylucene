Just updated to Yosemite: Where is my garageband? <body> So I used to have Garageband on my Mac before I updated to Yosemite. After the update, it is no longer here. Where do I now find Garageband after the update?  I tried to look on the App store, thinking maybe now you have to download it if you want it but they only have one for sale. I never paid for it, it was just always installed and used on both my Macs.  <comment181246> I don't know what happened to your old version, unless it was marked as incompatible, in which case it will be in MacintoshHD  Incompatible Software... but if you had an old version, v6 is most likely as it was on the OS installer DVD for a time, it likely hasn't seen an update since. Apple want you to buy v10 over again.
