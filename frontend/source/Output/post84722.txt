How to control your iPad with your Mac remotely? <body> I would like to know, is there a way to control your iPad with your Mac remotely (be able to see and manipulate iPad's desktop on your Mac)? I know that with the TeamViewer or other programs you can control your Mac with your iPad but not vice versa.  <answer84725> You can remotely control your iOS device's screen using one of many Mobile Device Management solutions, such as AirWatch for example. However, these are enterprise-level tools that are typically used in the workplace. There is no easy way to do this as a home user, unless you enroll in such a program.  You can also jailbreak your iPad and install a VNC server.  <answer84726> There are a couple of options. iKeyboardRemote is an app that claims to do just what you want, and is free. However, after installing it, it seems like it's limited to pressing the home button, looking at Pictures, and playing music.   A second option is to jailbreak the iPad and install the VNC server Veency through Cydia. You can then use a VNC viewer like the one from RealVNC to connect.  <answer104799> It is not possible to remotely control the screen of an iPad unless you jailbreak and install a VNC server as MattDMo suggested. This is because the security model in iOS does not allow an app to reach outside of its sandbox to control other apps or the springboard home screen. Apple does not provide any remote control functionality at the iOS level either. There is no way to do what you are asking for without jailbreaking.  Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions do not allow remote control of the screen on iOS either. MDM can push configuration profiles to control settings on an iPad, or prompt the user to install an app from the app store, but they can't control the screen. Airwatch offers a screen control option, but this only works on platforms that support it (not iOS). I work with several MDM vendors, including Airwatch, and this is not possible because Apple does not make this functionality available in iOS.  <answer228901> There's a tool made for testing purpose can do that. IOSgateway   Enjoy  <answer246991> Although it this solution is very limited,  ol liYou can mirror the iPhone screen using QuickTime./li liYou can control the keyboard using 1Keyboard(paid)/li /ol  <answer248464> You can try Reflector tool to mirror iOS devices in mac. Go over this tutorial http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/two-different-ways-to-mirror-an-ios-device-to-a-mac--cms-23533  <comment97566> Thank you, but I would be more interested in legal solutions for home users. <comment97567> Jailbreaking is legal under the DMCA in the United States. However, if you do not want to jailbreak, then the answer is "no". <comment97568> Since your location is listed as UK, I thought I would also add that it is considered legal under the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 law. <comment206329> Great summary; to potentially save others a trip to acronymfinder.com: MDM = Mobile Device Management. <comment263364> It looks like there's an enhanced version of iKeyboard that gives you (more) keyboard access on iOS, but you have to pay for it: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ikeyboard/id441439411?mt=12 <comment286718> How does this work and is the accepted answer http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/104799/237 wrong? <comment286734> ***"..and this is not possible because Apple does not make this functionality.."*** <comment286739> And Apple has less APIs than products <comment286750> I don't know how they do behind the scenes but It works So It should be wrong accepted answer. Just plug your device and open this tool. Nothin' fancy <comment286753> Have you used it a quick view of their docs on that screen seem to imply it runs scripts on the IOS device not remotely controls it <comment286791> The tool is kind of VNC. They have an IDE to write scripts that tell the IOSGateway tap to specific location. I have been using it for 3 years to remote ipad plugin to my mac at home from my office. <comment286793> So does it all you to "be able to see and manipulate iPad's desktop on your Mac" as the question asks? <comment286907> Yes, it absolutely can do that. <comment304738> Welcome to Ask Different!
