Macbook battery problem <body> I have a strongMacBook 13" (A1181)/strong running Mac OS X 10.6.8, I have a problem with the battery  When its turned off it responds to power button only when charger plugged in.  After starting i can remove the charger, and it keeps working on the battery.  But there is an strongx/strong on the battery, and it shows     No Batteries Available      Power Source: Battery   I've tried the following:   ul liI checked the battery with an other mac, and every thing was fine/li liI did SMC reset with no results/li liI even replaced the battery cable and the magsafe/li /ul  Nothing resolved the problem  What should i try now??  Any idea will be helpful  Thanks  <answer142083> Your SMC reset did not work.  Check your SMC reset procedure.  You have a 5 Years old battery!- it is EOL, get a new one.  <comment167442> As I told its not the battery, because on other mac it works fine.   For SMC reset I did the process described at  http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964   1-Shut down the computer   2-Disconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the computer, if it's connected   3-Remove the battery   4-Press and hold the power button for 5 seconds   5-Release the power button   6-Reconnect the battery and MagSafe power adapter   7-Press the power button to turn on the computer <comment167474> A 5 Years old battery is not fine! It might work for a short while. Publish your battery profile from the about this Mac. <comment167616> There is no battery profile in the About this mac section. It says battery not installed, even that i can work on the battery for an hour!! <comment167617> I have an other macbook of the same model, i tried switching pieces of the both macs but no thng works. Now i'me sure the problem is in the logic board, i dont think its a hard problem, it should be the PRAM <comment167618> When i switch the PRAMs the computer doesn't even start. Do you know why? <comment167632> Did you reset the PRAM ? Reset the Mac's PRAM (aka NVRAM aka firmware settings). You can do this by holding Command-Option-P-R at startup, and holding them down until the computer has restarted & chimed three times (actually, it's reset by the second chime, but three is traditional). Also check your Firmware version. <comment168541> All that didn't work. Its a defective logic board. I think I just need a new mac, since its not easy to find a new logic board. Thanks.
