User and System Appications Folder <body> In Mavericks (OS X 10.9), the User's Application folder is a separate folder from the System Application folder. Is there a way to see these two folders as one, similar to how it works on Windows? Otherwise, having both in the Finder Sidebar looks confusing and clunky: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cYlW1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer149110> You can create a smart folder which shows the contents of both folders. Go to File &rarr; New Smart Folder and add both the directories as rules for the smart folder.  <comment175641> This must be an error. The app you are showing is just a short cut that ended in separate folder. It is actually not there, so find the original app and delete that shortcut. <comment175643> You might also want to read this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9048601 <comment175655> No. It's not an error. It's an alias, sure, but Racket's working fine. My questions is more along the lines of given two separate Applications folders: /Users/user/Applications and /System/Applications, how can I combine the view of these into a single folder. The answer below sounds promising, but isn't straightforward <comment175662> How do you create a rule for the contents of the directory? I looked at adding the folder contents via criteria other-search for folder, which provided Document Container: Containing Folder of Item and a text box to type in the folder name, but it didn't appear to work with matches and any version of the folder name, or is, begins with, etc. <comment175725> ~/Applications/ has been there for ages <comment176898> Smart Folder isn't as smart as one may think. ;-) criteria-kind = application. The caveat is that you'll get ALL applications on your mac as result. even those in your download folder or somewhere else.
