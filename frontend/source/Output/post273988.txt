I want to backup on my timecapsule which is located on another network (external IP) with timemachine <body> To explain my situation, we moved from our older office (which was located at someone his home) to a new office. The TimeCapsuleis still located in the old office (and is meant to stay there as it is used there as well). But I still want to back-up my files to the timecapsule though it is in another network.   The TimeCapsule is not used as a router and is in bridge mode connected to the network. I already opened port 548 on the router ( I read somewhere that the port should be opened).   It is a 2TB flat version (so not the Airport or Airport extreme) of the timecapsule (not sure which gen but I'll look it up and update it here as soon as I can). The OS from which I am doing the updates is version 10.9.5 Mavericks  Both devices will stay connected to their networks (no macbook or something that is moved around)   I also read something about using Back to My Mac but I don't know if it is possible to use that for making back-ups. Any solution that will make it possible to back-up with TimeMachine on my TimeCapsule while both being on another network will make me happy  <comment344607> I believe the best answer is to create a VPN on the first network and connect to the VPN to back up from outside the first network I do this regularly with my computer.
