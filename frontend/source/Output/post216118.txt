iTunes media keys not working in Mac OS X El Capitan <body> My media keys had stopped working in iTunes on my Macbook Pro. They were working fine in VLC. I tried checking for the usual suspects:  ul liiTunes preferences/li liGoogle Chrome Play music extension/li /ul  Neither of them was the case for me.  I created a new user account on my Mac and the media keys worked fine on that one. So I tried copying the codecom.apple.itunes/code files from the Library of that account into the main account. This didn't help neither. What should I do?  <answer216119> Finally, I ran the following 2 commands in my terminal:  precodelaunchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist /code/pre  Worked like a charm!  <comment341471> It didn't work for me somehow, macOS Sierra v10.12.2 on Macbook Air. does this require a system restart? <comment357277> this was already quite easy to find: https://superuser.com/a/827710/28411
