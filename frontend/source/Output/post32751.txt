How do I hide 'Hidden' files? <body> I set hidden files to be shown with the following commands:    codedefaults write com.apple.finder showHiddenFiles TRUE/codebr codekillall Finder/code    This worked as expected.  Then I tried to hide them again with the following commands:  codedefaults write com.apple.finder showHiddenFiles FALSE/codebr codekillall Finder/code    This has worked in the past, but it doesn't seem to be working for me today.  All hidden files are still visible in Finder windows.  I tried a reboot and a disk permissions repair to no avail.  I'm not sure what else to try.  Anyone got any bright ideas?  <answer32753> Try:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles false /code/pre  or with a lowercase f in finder, depending on the version of Mac OS X. And then:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  <comment37433> haha no way!  That worked, thanks.  Can't believe it was that simple! I need to wait 5 minutes to accept. <comment37434> For what it's worth.  I just changed `ShowHiddenFiles` to `AppleShowAllFiles` and that did it. <comment263187> 'true' & 'false' are predefined. TRUE, FALSE, XYZ all evaluate to an expression that is 'true'.  So TRUE is true, and false is false, but FALSE is true.
