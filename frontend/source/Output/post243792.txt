MacBook Pro stop charging at 99% <body> Most of the time my MacBook Pro stop charging at 99%. But when I check the battery status it says battery is charged. My battery cycles is around 500. Does it means I needs a new battery or it is something else? Thanks.  I am using Mid 2012 MBP.  <answer243796> This is normal and the reason to it is so as to prolong the overall life of the battery.
