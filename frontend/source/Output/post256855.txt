iTunes cannot read contents of iPhone <body> A few months ago my iPhone 4 deleted all of my music on its own. I wanted to put it back in, but instead of iTunes I used iFunbox (fatal error). The music kinda worked, but the titles of the songs didn't show up. So, I deleted everything and opened up iTunes, but to my surprise I saw this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oUAwd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  BTW, fun fact, I had a custom ringtone that just wouldn't play, but after I "broke" the device, it worked!  How can I fix this without formatting my iPhone? I want to avoid do that since I can't back it up.  It's no PC problem, because I have tried it on two different PCs!  (And also keep in mind that I can't perform a force reset or something on those lines, because the lock button is broken)  <comment320448> it's offering a restore... assuming iTunes contains a recent backup, that would look your best option <comment320454> Lates iTunes backup is too old and I now only rely on iCloud for obvious reasons... But I can't backup photos for storage limitations! I don't want a restore! <comment320456> If you want to be able to sync it with iTunes, that is your only option. <comment320545> Restore and download your bought music from iCloud again.
