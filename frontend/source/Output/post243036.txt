How to see colors in Xcode? <body> I'm interested in replacing written-out colors with their actual representation. The example is shown below is on Apple's website, and I can't seem to find a way to do it within Xcode. I'm afraid that something so useful might just be a marketing gimmick.   If not, how do I do what's to the right of   precodec.circleColor    =  c.lineColor      =  /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CieP5.png" alt="A picture showing an xcode source code example where colors are visually represented"  <answer243037> This is an Xcode emPlayground/em.  That's important because it's the only place (with the default settings) that you can display these colors.  strongEDIT (June 23, 2016)/strong: After reviewing the WWDC material on new features in Xcode, images are also supported.  This is done via codeimage literals/code.  This is taken from Apple's Playground Help:     ol   liOpen the source editor for the playground page that will contain the literal./li   liPlace the insertion point at the location in the code for the codeUIColor/code or codeNSColor/code./li   liChoose codeEditor &gt; Insert Color Literal/code.   A color literal is added at the insertion point, and the color picker opens.  The screenshot shows the color literal just inserted for the tintColor property of imageView.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/In7sj.png" alt="enter image description here"   Use the color picker to choose a different color for the inserted literal. In the figure below, codeimageView.tintColor/code has been changed to emAqua/em, which updates the color of the resulting image.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AhK8F.png" alt="enter image description here"/li   /ol   <comment299163> A little bummed out it's just the playground, but thank you regardless!
