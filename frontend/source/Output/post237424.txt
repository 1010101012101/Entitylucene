Does OS X or Xcode have applications to manage cheat sheet/commands list? <body> I'm learning coding on OS X, as I'm a beginner, I have to read cheat sheets and I have bunch of files like that, Git commands, Ubuntu Server commands, Node.js modules command and so on.  Today I saw my friend using Cloud9, it's Cloud IDE, it has a small area called "Commands" where he can search and read tiny description about it, also keyboard shortcut.  I know that feature is so specific to Cloud9, but do we have similar functionality in some app on OS X, where I can create and store my usually cheatsheets? I don't need 100% exactly the same, just same same is ok.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wJFyF.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  strongUpdate:/strong I'm going to write my own app, I will let you know if I can archive anything. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/viiTE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237437> For applications in OS X, you can search for functions and keyboard shortcuts through an application's "Help" menu. This is similar to Cloud9's commands menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4o3uk.jpg" alt="Demonstration of the feature mentioned above."  <answer237557> I use CheatSheet which pops up a window if you press the Command key long enough and displays all currently available keyboard shortcuts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NeBEt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237781> Try Dash.      Dash is an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager. Dash stores snippets of code and instantly searches offline documentation sets for 150+ APIs ... You can even generate your own docsets or request docsets to be included.   <answer237869> Perhaps the terminal command 'apropos' could be of use.  For example... 'apropos remote' should show commands for carrying out remote operations.  <answer238110>    cheat allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line. It was designed to help remind *nix system administrators of options for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.   https://github.com/chrisallenlane/cheat  They also have a wiki page listing similar projects.   <comment290848> I usually like to create my own list on notepad or such since you're on OsX and leave it open for easy reference. <comment291009> @Gmenfan83, I have a huge collection on my Evernote, and it works. I just want to manage it better. <comment291083> Thank you. I like the idea of this app, but it is not what I'm looking for. Example, I'm using Terminal in OS X, and I want to check what is the command to copy files from this folder to another folder in Ubuntu server that I'm working over ssh. <comment291421> @SangĐặng just google `bash cheat sheet` or `shell cheat sheet` and you’ll find numerous examples of what you’re looking for. I use one regularly (can’t find the original web source, but I have the single page .pdf). An application is overkill, unless you want it to check the syntax of a particular command…[Text Mate](http://macromates.com) is a great one. <comment291427> Please read the question above, dear my friend. I know how to find it. I have tons of cheatsheets in my computer and I WANT A BETTER WAY to control it. <comment291428> Thank you, I will try it. The idea is really close to what I want.
