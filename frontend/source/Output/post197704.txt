OS X 10.10.2 Grey screen and progress bar at start-up normal? <body> Running OS X 10.10.2 and has for a long time had a grey screen at start-up which occasionally freezes but most of the time just starts up after a while. Is this normal? At last upgrade the process froze after several hours and the above situation has been since then  <answer197709> I'd run the 'usual suspects' before anything else.   Disk Utility  check/repair disk.   Then get OnyX (free/donationwear) &amp; reset ACLs (Maintenance tab  permissions, check the box at the top.)    Then re-apply the 10.10.2 combo update.  <comment236887> verifying disk permission, and a lot of issues with printer appeared. Don't know if thats of importance. Disk verified without issues. May I ask why you suggest 10.10.2 combo and not 10.10.4 ? <comment236897> Because you said you had 10.10.2 - fix the existing install before updating. Printer installs often seem to show permissions issues, first pass should fix them <comment237333> did the two first steps you mentioned (in fact, ACT permission issues), but weren't able install the 10.10.2 combo, as I got this when trying to: "OS X Update Combined can't be installed on this disk.  This volume does not meet the requirements for this update." Then tried this https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203482 which however didn't solve it. Now went ahead with the 10.10.4 update but still the same grey start-up screen... <comment237344> That support link has nothing to do with your issue. You've now probably compounded whatever issue you did have & the next thing to do is run from Internet Recovery & re-install the OS - https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201314
