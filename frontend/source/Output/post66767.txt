How to make sure macports only upgrades to ports that are at least a month old? <body> The goal is to insulate a code base from potential problems with new port upgrades.  So maybe if a codeport upgrade outdated/code command can be amended not to use the freshest of the fresh ports, you can avoid tracking down errors in ports affecting your code.  As far as I see,  codeport info port_name/code doesn't have any extra release date options:  precode$ port help info Usage: info --category --categories --depends_fetch --depends_extract --depends_build --depends_lib             --depends_run --depends --description --epoch --fullname --heading --homepage     --index --license --line             --long_description --maintainer --maintainers --name --platform --platforms --portdir --pretty             --replaced_by --revision --subports --variant --variants --version /code/pre  I suppose the best alternative to this is to perform daily incremental upgrades. Then when something breaks, it's easier to rollback since likely only a few ports will change per day.  <answer66768> You could potentially monitor the SVN repo that all the Portfiles are distributed in to determine when last each port was changed.  Take a look here: http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories, and set up a local copy of the macports trunk. Once in a while go see what revision number (#####) was committed about a month ago, and codesvn upgrade -r #####/code  Make sure you remove the default macports source, though:  precode#rsync://rsync.macports.org/release/ports [default] /code/pre  Clearly a different approach to where you were heading with the codeport/code command, but it would work.
