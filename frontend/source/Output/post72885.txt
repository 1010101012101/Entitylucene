Can I export my account configuration from Mail app and import it into Outlook? <body> I am meeting an unexpected issue where Mail app connects just fine to my Exchange 2007 server given my email address, login and password (autodiscovery), but Outlook 2011 fails to connect. If I try to copy the settings Mail app discovers by itself to Outlook, I still don't get any connection. I am using my Mac behind a VPN where I redirected the http and https ports to a proxy. I can connect fine through the web interface with codehttps://myserver/owa/code.  Can I export my account configuration from Mail app and import it into Outlook? Is there any hidden parameter I would need to clean in Outlook (my company recently changed its servers and protocols)?
