How do I sync contacts between 2 iCloud accounts? <body> I need to sync my contact list with my husband's phone. We both have our own iCloud accounts.  <answer276200> To my knowledge iCloud will not do this between two separate iCloud accounts. Two options: Option 1  ol liCreate an additional AppleID for contact/calendar sync only. Add that account to your devices but don't sign in yet./li liYou will not be able to use your own AppleID and the additional AppleID you just created concurrently./li liOn each persons computer, drag your contacts to your desktop to create vcard files. Log out of the personal account./li liLogin to the 3rd AppleID (shared)./li liDrag the vcard files into the Contacts.app which will add them to the app. Repeat this process on any additioanal computer that wants to share the list. This is the contact (and calendar) you will use going forward. You can still keep a private contact list under your original AppleID but you will need to logout and back into that ID when you want to access the private contacts./li liOnce you are done remove the duplicates or merge the contacts and any private contacts you don't want in the list. There are several additional apps that will do this for you. Just do a search on the internet for one that suits you./li /ol  Option 2  Setup a Google account that you both use for contacts and sync with that. This method is not optimal because in either scenario you will end up with all contacts included in the set and because there's always a chance that some future update to googles apps this method may cause problems in the future.  <comment347532> on your husband's phone go to Settings - Mail - Add an account then choose sync contacts
