How to install Apache into a custom directory? <body> How to install a copy of Apache into a local custom directory via Terminal (to code~/Desktop//code for example), so it can live without conflicts with another global version of Apache and I cant start and stop it from there?  <answer115936> h1homebrew/h1  Consider using homebrew to manage a private, isolated, installation of Apache codehttpd/code on your Mac.  To install codebrew/code and Apache codehttpd/code on your Mac, follow the steps on homebrew; the two main steps are:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" /code/pre  This will install the codebrew/code command line tool.  Next use jabberwik's tap to install codehttpd/code:  precodebrew tap jabberwik/homebrew-httpd brew install httpd24 /code/pre  h1MAMP/h1  An alternative approach is to use a pre-packaged application, such as MAMP. Running MAMP will immediately provide Apache httpd, PHP and MySQL preconfigured and ready to use.  <comment135691> +1 for MAMP, absolutely love it and use it all the time. <comment135772> ok, thanks, i'll give it a try. <comment263713> When I run this, it doesn't include any of the apache modules so I get errors like httpd: Syntax error on line 171 of /usr/local/etc/apache2/2.4/httpd.conf: Cannot load libexec/mod_rewrite.so <comment263717> Also that github repo is a 404
