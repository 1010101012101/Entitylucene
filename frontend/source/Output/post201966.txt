Can a single Apple ID/ iTunes account switch between multiple country AppStores to buy free Apps unique to each country? <body> Can a single Apple ID/ iTunes account switch between multiple country AppStores to buy free Apps unique to each country?   If I use my single Apple ID/ iTunes account but move &amp; have moved across countries where certain Apps are only on those country AppStores, can I switch between them and buy Free Apps, yet maintain them on my iTunes and iOS devices?   Additional Information:br I am wondering if this workaround worked for someone / still works?   It was done on Mac OSX, but I am wondering if it can be done in Windows.   <answer228588> Changing a country of your single Apple ID is a pain. You can do it ones without consequences but the second time you do it you'll be asked to provide credit card details of a "new" country of your residence. The easiest way to use App Store of different countries is to have 2 different Apple ID registered for certain country.  <comment243583> Please check: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/86349/re-downloading-apps-purchased-in-a-different-country
