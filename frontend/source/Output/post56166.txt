Continuously backs up same files as if this was the first time doing a backup <body> On Snow Leopard 10.6.8, TimeMachine keeps backing up the same files over and over again, as if they were not backed up the first time. As a result, each time I get a full backup of 300 GB!  I checked the Backups.backupdb folder tree and looked at "snapshots by date" (e.g. 2012-07-06-201030). What is strange is the files TimeMachine backs up have exactly the same MD5 checksum for each backup.  Any ideas?  <comment89568> How are you looking at "snapshots by date" if just browsing in Finder then they will appear even if not backed up again <comment89602> Can you post the console logs from `backupd` the next time Time Machine does a full backup without inheriting files from the previous one?
