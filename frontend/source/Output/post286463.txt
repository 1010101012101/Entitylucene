Google Chrome crashes with EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION on Sierra <body> New iMac running Sierra 10.12.5. 3 days ago suddenly started freezing intermittently for 3-5 minutes at a time. Activity Monitor was showing CPU spikes that corresponded to the freezes. Console reported some push spawn incidents. I pasted code into Terminal to get system report. The output is too long to paste here, but I have pasted into pastebin. Shortly after that, the computer froze and crashed. Tried to shut down, but it froze on shut down so I had to turn it off.   Restarted in safe mode. Seemed okay, so I started up Chrome - which at once reported that it had not shut down properly and began to act very unstable, flickering and loading from bottom over and over. I quit Chrome, uninstalled it and downloaded it, then reinstalled. But on opening it, it repeated the same bizarre behaviour.  In the meantime, Console system log shows:     Jun 11 03:58:44 iMac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.watchdogd): Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds.

Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds.   And it was constantly repeating the same thing.  Crash log shows:     Process:               Google Chrome [776]   Path:                  /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome   Identifier:            com.google.Chrome   Version:               58.0.3029.110 (3029.110)   Code Type:             X86-64 (Native)   Parent Process:        ???

What is causing the freezing? How can I uninstall Chrome and put things right again?  hr  Also deleted Chrome &amp; Chrome folder in codeApplication Support/Google/code. Before I can reinstall Chrome, Console is continuing to report pushing:     respawn: Jun 11 10:29:55 iMac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.quicklook[2749]): Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs. Please switch to XPC or bootstrap_check_in(): com.apple.quicklook Jun 11 10:29:57 iMac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.watchdogd[2750]): Service exited with abnormal code: 255 Jun 11 10:29:57 iMac com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.watchdogd): Service only ran for 0 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 10 seconds.   <answer288656> This sounds like a bug in the Google Chrome application itself. This probably is related to word predictions feature (e.g. when switching input method and then typing right away).  See the existing bug report No support for Chinese Input Predictive Completions on Mac OS Sierra. People reporting it are having very similar crash reports.  If you think the problem is related to something else, feel free to report a new bug against Chrome.  <comment361405> Delete the Chrome app, then in `/Library/Application Support/Google` delete the Chrome folder. Reinstall the Chrome app. Report back. <comment361409> That should be `~/Library/Application Support/Google`, i.e. the folder in your user directory. <comment361420> Deleted Chrome & Chrome folder in Application Support/Google.
