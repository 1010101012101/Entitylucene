How to not have thumbnails overlap in Finder? <body> How can you drag thumnails around in Finder so that they can't overlap other thumbnails.  Even when "Snap To Grid" is set, thumbnails just snap on top of other ones.  I don't quite know how this would even be useful.  What I'd like is the typical thing where as you drag it to a spot it opens a hole in the grid for it to be and everything to the right of it is shifted over  <answer246656> You need to have either 'Sort by' or 'Arrange By' set to something, rather than just having Snap to Grid set.br Right-click in the folder but not on an icon to see the option, or kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd J /kbd    <comment304256> But then I can't move and rearrange the thumbnails, which was the whole reason I was trying to get this to work <comment304257> You are in an either/or situation, I'm afraid - hoping for an iOS -type solution which doesn't exist on any desktop, afaik.
