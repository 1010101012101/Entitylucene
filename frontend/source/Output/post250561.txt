Is .profile or .bashrc backed up anywhere automatically? <body> There are hidden files that are fairly important if you use terminal a lot at ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc, etc. Are these files backed up anywhere by default? sometimes I append to environment variables to code.profile/code via command line, e.g. codeecho 'export foo=bar' &gt;&gt; ~.profile/code and realized that I could be in big trouble if I accidentally left out one of the code&gt;/code characters.  <answer250586> No, there is no special handling of code.profile/code, code.bashrc/code or any other config file within OS X. So unless you are running a regular backup (e.g. using Time Machine), these files will be lost if you type code&gt;/code instead of code&gt;&gt;/code.  Some of-the-top-of-the-head ideas to overcome this  ul lirun a regular backup (there are probably files on your computer which are more important than code.profile/code so you should be doing this anyway)/li lichange habits and use the text editor of your choice to update shell profiles/li licreate a shell function to do the append operation, e.g. something like this (untested)  precodeadd_to_profile() {     echo &gt;&gt; ~/.profile     echo '# ' Added on $(date) &gt;&gt; ~/.profile     echo $* &gt;&gt; ~/.profile } /code/pre  and use it like codeadd_to_profile 'export foo=bar'/code./li liuse Hazel (or Folder Actions) to backup code.profile/code and code.bashrc/code automatically after each change/li liput those files under version control (either locally or on Github)/li /ul  <comment311212> Nothing at all is backed automatically - What is your normal backup? Given this we can say how the .bashrc etc files should be backed up
