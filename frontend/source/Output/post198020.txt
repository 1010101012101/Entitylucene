1.2 GB used even when I reset then restore from iTunes? <body> I have had my iPad mini 2 for 2 days and I think there may be a problem. It's 16 GB, iOS 8.4 with a capacity of 11.9 GB.  I've done a full reset and a restore from iTunes, but it's available space is 10.7 GB. There is an unexplained 'used 1.2 GB' when I check usage. I check iTunes and it says there is an odd 10.97 GB free and says 859 MB documents and data, 120 MB other.  This is the most odd part, after I reset: almost the full 11.9 GB is free however the used space rises as if something is downloading. I turn off Wi-Fi and it stopsâ€¦ turn it back on and it rises till it reaches 1.2 GB.  I doubt this is an update as it say it's iOS 8.4 before it has fully become 1.2 GB.  I'm thinking of changing Apple ID so there is a different iCloud or can someone tell me that the 1.2 GB is part iOS app updates or something?  <comment236851> is it on icloud or synced ? <comment236852> ive used both :/ but ive deleted icloud backup as it was showing an unknown 100mb <comment236853> did you sign out of the app store (itunes) <comment236854> it wasnt signed in after i did a reset for itunes however i did sign in to my apple id <comment236862> If, after a restore, you signed in to your Apple ID while going through the welcome screens, it will sign in to all sorts of items including iCloud. I would check for potentially enabled Photo Stream or the likes, which may sync back as soon as the iOS device is reconnected to iCloud. Basically check your iCloud settings in the Settings app and see which is enabled, and disable those you don't want or don't understand (nothing tried to imply here). <comment236877> this is the problem, i have no photos, this is a new ipad mini, the only thing could have been is that i have downloaded stuff from www.iosemusapp.com, maybe theres corrupt stuff in safari? <comment236879> my icloud has been 1mb at largest <comment236882> i just used a different apple id when reseting, and it does the same thing.
