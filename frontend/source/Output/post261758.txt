Importing music from Google Play to iTunes to iPod Shuffle <body> I recently discovered an old iPod Shuffle at my house. I wish to use it. Using a computer, an Andoid phone, and an iPod Shuffle, how can I get my Play Music to the Shuffle?  <comment327837> Computer - Shuffle requires iTunes on your computer (and either OSX or Windows), so the question boils down to "how can I get music from Google Play into iTunes".
