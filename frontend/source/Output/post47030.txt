1080p upload to youtube? <body> I just captured a video with my new iPad, then used the iPad's built-in tools to upload it to youtube.  I selected "high quality" but it appears to be only a 720p video on youtube (caution: kids and baby chicks herein).  Is there a way to upload a 1080p video from the iPad to Youtube?  <comment53859> I'm seeing a 720p version available now, maybe there's just a delay for some server-side encoding? The 1080p version could be on the way <comment54280> @KyleCronin It did go up to 720p, but not to 1080p, unless the processing queue is over 24 hours...
