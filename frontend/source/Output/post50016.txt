How to disable "Sync Apps" and "Open iTunes when this iDevice is connected" without forcing a sync? <body> I don't want to lose all the stuff on my device. Any way to stop my iPad from automatically syncing with iTunes when connected to the Mac? I turned these features on when I bought it, but in the long run it's not such a great idea.  <answer50017> Try going to Edit- Preferences- Syncing to disable syncing.  <answer52795> If you go in to iTunes and go to Preferences - Devices, and check the box that says Prevent iPods, iPhones, and iPads from syncing automatically.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sesC3.png" alt="enter image description here"
