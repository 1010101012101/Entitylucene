How do I make more space on a Macbook air? <body> I have a bunch of files that I don't need. I'm wondering what's taking up all the space. I am tempted to almost format the laptop and start fresh.  What can I do to find out what is taking up all the disk space in my Macbook?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SLGqE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer235807> Did you check your "About this Mac" and the tab "Other"? All the files that are not in one of the listed categories.  This article talks about what is other and how to clean your mac safely  <answer235808> I suggest using a tool like Space Gremlin to identify files eating up your disk space.  https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/space-gremlin/id414515628?mt=12 http://www.spacegremlinapp.com/
