Viewing preview of files in finder <body> I have some .groovy files on my file system.  I would like to be able to preview them in Finder as I navigate around them.  How do I do this?  <answer97376> If Finder does not automatically show a preview of a file when using QuickLook (default shortcut key is kbdSpace/kbd when file is selected), then the QuickLook extension does not support these files.  Unless you're a hard-core Mac/Unix developer, you won't be able to add this capability yourself. Never fear, however; this iis/i the Internet, after all, and odds are that someone's already developed the plugin for this. A good place to look is the QuickLook Plugins site.   Wherever you get your plugins, installation is very simple. Drag the plugin file (it will look something like a little white Lego brick) to the code/Library/QuickLook//code folder, log out, and log back in again. If everything is working properly, you should be able to press kbdSpace/kbd with your code.groovy/code file selected and see the QuickLook window appear with a preview.  Notes: You will probably need an admin username/password to modify the code/Library/QuickLook//code folder. Also, if QuickLook still doesn't show a preview after logging back in, try restarting your computer.  <answer97379> QLStephen displays files with no extension or with arbitrary extensions as plain text. You can install it by moving the qlgenerator bundle to code~/Library/QuickLook//code and running codeqlmanage -r/code.  If it doesn't display some file types, try adding their UTIs to codeCFBundleDocumentTypes:LSContentTypes/code in the Info.plist.
