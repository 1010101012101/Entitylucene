How can I mirror two macbooks <body> I have two macbooks. I want them to be exact copies. They have different CPUs, RAM, but they have the exact same drives.  I work on both of them. I never work on them simultaneously.  Can I setup something that will update what is new on the one, to the other?  I start doing something on macbook1, I want macbook2 to receive it via somekind of wireless connection.  I have an Airport Extreme, I can setup FTPs and whatever. Both macs will have high speed internet almost all the time.  I don't think DropBox is a solution. I have a lot of data and I don't want it on dropbox. CCC doesn't work bothways it has a source and a destination. Probably there is something with rsync, but is there an automated solution? OSX Server?  <answer134333> If you don't want to use DropBox another option could be ChronoSync.  I have not had personal experience with this application, but the reviews I have read sound very promising.  I am not going to go into full detail about this one, but I think it's worth a read. http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html  A feature of ChronoSync which will probably benefit you the most: http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_tips18.html  <answer134344> You could setup a Mac OS X Server and boot from the network, however you will need to have a third Mac, which might be costly unless you have an old one.br You can purchase the Server from the AppStore for $20. However, booting your Mac from your server requires a moderate internet connection as well as a quick bandwidth (at the place where the server is and your location) in order to work well.br The server offers a service called NetInstall that will allow you to boot from the server. More information how to active it can be obtained in the server documents in Update client software - Provide NetInstall service).
