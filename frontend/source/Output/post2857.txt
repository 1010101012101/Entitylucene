In Pages, What is this Line Under a Rectangle Shape? <body> There is a persistent thing going on in Pages where there is a line under a rectangle shape when I make it. How do I get rid of it? I don't want it to show up when I export the document to a PDF. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nKkpF.png" alt="alt text"  <answer4823> Simple.  Make sure you've selected the object you want to remove the line from.  Click your inspector, and navigate over to the emgraphic tab/em (see screenshot).  select emnone./em  Last screenshot shows the result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UCFL4.png" alt="alt text"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6USMJ.png" alt="alt text"  <comment2546> It’s not clear from your picture where the rectangle is or where is that line coming from. Are you sure it’s not one of the rectangle’s borders?   What template are you using? Could you post a sample with a document that exhibits the behavior? <comment4827> is this a recursive question? <comment13143> did that answer your question?
