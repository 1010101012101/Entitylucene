OSX Mavericks: reinstall Ruby without reinstalling the whole system <body> I was "wise" enough to uninstall system Ruby on my Mac. So the question is: emhow to install Ruby without reinstalling everything?/em  emMaybe important:/em  ol liI can't use AppStore because it wants credit card number, but I haven't got any/li liMy friend has the same OSX version, can I copy some folders from his PC and recover Ruby in such way?/li /ol  <comment170530> You could always build from the source. <comment170563> @ecnepsnai sure. But that will never recreate your `Ruby.framework` folder and nothing will work. So the solution I found is just to ask the user with the same OS X version to copy his `Ruby.framework` folder. <comment198893> use Pacifist. http://superuser.com/a/227653/36776
