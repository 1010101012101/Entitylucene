Notes app search is not finding some notes <body> I am using my notes app on OSX 10.11.5 and iOS 8. For the most part, things are working, but I am noticing that many of my older notes are not searchable. When I type something in the search box, these older notes do not appear in search results even if there is a match. However, if I edit a note or create a new one, it is fully searchable.  My guess is that somehow the search indexes for my notes got corrupted. Is there any way to fix this or rebuild the indexes?  <answer240562> You should try reindexing spotlight on your mac. In terminal type codesudo mdutil -E //code and you will be prompted for your password, this can take some time though depending on your drive speed  <answer241693> If your notes are in iCloud, make a local backup. Then in iCloud settings uncheck Notes. Your Notes will all be removed. Now turn Notes back on. They should all return and this force an index rebuild.  <answer241954> Much quicker way of fixing this is just to make a new iCloud notes folder, move all your notes into that and back again. This seems to rebuild the index- you can then get rid of the new folder.  This is useful if like me you don't have a quick option to back up your notes separately.   <answer284952> I got this when I tried the mdutil:  precode$ sudo mdutil -E / Password: /:     Error: unknown indexing state. /code/pre  Executing the following, reenabled indexing and search through Apple Notes was resolved:  precode$ sudo mdutil -E -v -i on / Password: /:     Indexing enabled.

I will let you know if this works. <comment295719> Do you have your notes stored locally or on the internet? (iCloud, gmail...) Or maybe they are spread around different places? <comment295736> iCloud. Turns out that on my iPhone, the notes show up, so I thought that it would have been a spotlight issue, but when I tried the suggestion below, the search was not fixed. <comment295737> Hmmm...nope. This did not work. <comment297089> Thanks for the idea. Backing up my notes now and seeing if this will work. <comment297096> Yep. That did the trick! <comment347845> Worked beautifully.  Very simple and elegant solution, thanks. <comment349512> Are you sure this didn't work?  Not doubting your honesty, just curious. I thought it would delete all Spotlight indexes and rebuild. Although, as @levanth suggested, it usually takes quite a while. <comment363006> Had this exact problem and `sudo mdutil -E /` solved it for me on MacOS Sierra 10.12.5.
