Enabling Intel VT on Macbook Pro 9,2 (Mid 2012) <body> I want to enable (if it's not) Intel VT-x to speed up the Android emulator.  How can I see if it's enabled and if not how to do it ?   <answer108553> Apple says VT-x technology is enabled on Intel-based Macs.  It seems to be (after this page) that only first Intel-based Macs may have some problem with VT-x so it should not be your case.
