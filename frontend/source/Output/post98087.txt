Time Machine backup of legacy filevault encrypted homedir? <body> I have recently upgraded from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion. Given that I don't have a lot of space left on disk, it was not feasible to migrate from Filevault to Filevault 2.  I have just noticed today that Time Machine seems to ignore my homedir sparsebundle in its backups. On Snow Leopard, it would back it up when I logged out. Now it does not do that anymore, and so I don't have any backup of my homedir since the migration to Mountain Lion. Does anyone have any ideas on how this can be fixed or worked around?  <answer98090> I haven't tested this on 10.8.4, but here's how I used to work around this.  ol liMake a second account that exists only for you to be able to log out completely of your main account./li liLog into the second account only./li liStart a backup so that the legacy file vault files can be backed up./li /ol  Basically, Time Machine doesn't run unless emsomeone/em is logged in.  <comment115145> Ok, that sounds a bit hack-ish, but it should work... It's weird that they've changed that behavior. I'll give it a try, thanks for the answer!
