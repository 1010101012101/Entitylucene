Reactive my iPhone5 <body> My iPhone 5 was stolen and I erased and removed it via iCloud.  After three days I found it and want to active it again.  What is the procedure for recovering the content and activating it again?  also when I turn on the devise a massage as below is appeared:  "your iPhone could not be activated because the activation server is temporarily unavailable. try connection your iPhone to activate it, or try again in couple of minute"  I tried times and times but it doesn't work.  what should I do?  <answer185963> To reactive your phone you should introduce a SIM Card connected to internet, plug it to iTunes then try to reactive it until Apple won't restore his server (try in a couple of hours...), it should ask you your Apple ID password.  To recover the content you can restore it from backup.
