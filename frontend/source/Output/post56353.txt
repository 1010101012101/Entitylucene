Filevault login screen slow to start after trying to install Windows using bootcamp <body> Since trying to install Windows 7 on my iMac with Lion 10.7.4, using Boot Camp, I noticed that the login screen where it asks for the FileVault password is taking a lot of seconds to be displayed.   When I turn on the computer, after the sound only a blank screen is shown for a lot for seconds.  Even after removing the Windows partition using Boot Camp, this slow down persists.  Anyone with similar problem, or solution?  <answer56359> The common cause is when the OS X EFI isn't selected in startup preferences (and then stored in NVRAM) so the system needs to read all drives before defaulting to the lowest numbered Mac volume.   A more oddball case would be if the kernel caches are somehow invalid and must be recreated which slows a boot sequence considerably.
