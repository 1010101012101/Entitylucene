Run a macOS app in restricted environment? <body> Is there a way to run a native macOS application and restrict it's access to the system? (I guess this is sometimes called emsandboxing/em.)  Mainly I want to define what folders it can write to, or read from. Other restrictions, like network access, could also be useful.   I want to do this when I download an app that I don't completely trust. I'm worried it might have malware that writes system files, or it could spy on me and read other documents.
