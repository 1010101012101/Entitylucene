Switching all open windows on 2 displays with one keystroke <body> At the moment I'm using two displays for my MacBook. The larger screen is the one I primarily use because of its available space. The smaller one (MacBook) is used to glance on if I ever need to check something. In the case that I watch a class on the secondary while working on the primary and something important comes up, I would like to switch the applications displayed on both screens with one keystroke (so if I have TextEdit and Safari open on the big screen, and YouTube on the small, I want to move TextEdit/Safari to the small and YouTube to the big screen with a single keystroke).  Hopefully someone has an idea to accomplish this.  <answer216851> You can set a shortcut to move among your screens. In fact, the monitor you add is just considered as another Desktop space. So you can perform the following steps:  ol liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts tab;/li liOn the left menu, select emMission Control/em;/li liThere will appear some options. First of all, check that the emMission Control/em function is enabled. There will be consequently shown some other sub-options, such as "emSwitch to Desktop X/em", corresponding a certain shorcut. The default one is kbdctrl/kbd+emX/em, where emX/em is the number of Desktop to switch to. You can customize this shortcut as you prefer./li /ol  Then, you can just perform the shortcut corresponding in switching to the Desktop space you want and it's done.  If you don't know/remember the 'identification emX/em' of your screen, just show your Mission Control (in my case pressing kbdF9/kbd) and check for the Desktop number.  <comment262135> What do you mean by switching screens? Changing keyboard focus or exchanging the screen content (applications displayed) between the large screen and the internal screen? <comment262397> Exchanging the screen content (applications displayed) between the large screen and the internal screen.   Thanks for taking the time to help! <comment262400> Thanks for taking the time to help mgiordi!   The thing is I tried this option but it doesn't seem to work if I want to switch desktops on a screen. I can identify the screens, but switching did not work. Not with the default shortcut and not with a selfmade shortcut. <comment262419> Try following this other post: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/116557/how-to-make-each-display-a-separate-space-yet-have-a-keyboard-shortcut-to-move
