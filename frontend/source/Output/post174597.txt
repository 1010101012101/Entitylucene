View trash sorted by date deleted <body> I was trying to organize and select all my old music from my previous computer and copied a folder with all my music files to my mac book desktop. Started deleting all the songs I didn't wanted and after all done, accidentally I selected all the music that was left on the folder and deleted it as well. Is there is a way I can access the trash and see only the latest music files I deleted? If I could see the time they where deleted I knew which music files I have to restore, so I don't have to be restoring all the files, including the ones I do not want!  <answer174668> Too late now, but next time you accidentally move/delete something in the Finder, remember kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd Z /kbd is the (almost) universal shortcut for Undo.  For now, open the Trash, set to List View, then right click the columns bar &amp; add "Date Added". Then click that to sort latest additions to the top.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6s5Xq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment205596> you want to see when the Trash was last emptied? <comment298745> Is there a way to do this in the terminal? <comment298781> I'm sure that would be better asked as a new question.
