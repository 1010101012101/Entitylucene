Time Machine drive encryption going for 22 hours. Is it stalled? <body> I set up Time Machine in Mountain Lion by plugging in a newly formatted 500GB USB drive, selecting that from the Time Machine dialog, and checking the box to encrypt my backups. A window appeared that said "Preparing disk [diskname] for encryption." The progress bar quickly filled to about 80% and then stalled there. It's been about 22 hours now with no sign of progress. I know encrypting a drive can take a while, but is this too long? Should I force quit or unplug the drive and start over?  Notes:  ul liI checked the system log to verify that the computer's been up and working all night; it didn't go to sleep. /li liThe drive is no longer showing up in the finder or Disk Utility. Is that normal when encryption is in progress?/li /ul  <answer74200> 22 hours is very long indeed. I have encrypted a 1TB drive in less time before.     The encryption is handled by a "live background process". "This   process continues seamlessly across reboots. The logical volume   remains usable at all times."      supfrom man page  diskutil  encryptVolume/sup   Maybe this daemon hangs or simply halted because the drive is not mounted (which is fine). So you should just re-mount it again.  Alternatively, I would try I restart the daemon by simply restarting the computer. Once the Time Machine backup is mounted again, the daemon will continue encrypting the drive.  h3Checking the encryption progress using diskutil/h3  You can check the status of the encryption by using the command:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  In the nested tree you will see a emLogical Volume Family/em which is currently being encrypted. If you drive is being encrypted, you should see the entry codeConversion Status:       Converting/code.  precodeEncryption Status:           Unlocked     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Conversion Status:       Converting      //what does it say here?

I encrypted a 300 GB Time Machine Drive in about 6h yesterday. (connected via USB 3.0) <comment86230> This is an incredibly useful answer, thank you. I decided to abort the process shortly before reading this, so I can't test it myself. The drive has been having serious problems since then, even after reformatting, so I suspect something is going wrong with it. <comment98419> Being used to the above, I was quite surprised that erasing a disk and enabling encryption in Disk Utility, and then copying lots of data to that empty disk, shows "Complete" right after the copying is done. But erasing/encrypting a disk and then use that for Time Machine indeed needs a looooong encryption process *after* the first backup is complete. (So, both start with an erased and encrypted disk. Actually: I'm more surprised that Time Machine uses a post-encryption step if the disk was already marked encrypted when erasing it.) <comment261476> Also you can see progress of conversion with this entry: `Conversion Progress:   11%`
