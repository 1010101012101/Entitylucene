Draft emails on Spotlight Search <body> When I access my Drafts Gmail folder on my iPhone 4S, there are no saved mails in the draft. However, when I search under Spotlight Search, I get a bunch of emails I started writing once but never sent. Also, there seems to be emails which I was writing &amp; stopped &amp; continued writing at a later stage. These mails even include mails i wrote using Yahoo &amp; Hotmail, which have since been deleted! Even though these emails were eventually successfully sent, I can still find them under Spotlight Search, or emails I started writing but then deleted. I need to delete these emails permanentiy from my iphone, any idea how I can do this please?
