Is there an iPod touch voice control app that can play music offline? <body> I recently bought a 5th generation iPod touch, but was dismayed to learn that I can't use Siri to play music in my car because it doesn't work offline. Is there a voice control app that I can use to choose songs without a wifi connection?  <answer176765> If you're willing to sacrifice Siri for the ability to control your music with your voice, you could turn off Siri in SettingsGeneralSiri, which'll make your iPod respond to a held-down Home button with the classic Voice Control interface instead. A Google search is telling me that that one works offline!  For more information about non-Siri Voice Control, check out Apple's support page. Here's what it says about music playback:     ul   liYou can play all songs in an album, playlist, or by an artist. The device won't recognize commands to play a particular song./li   liIf you can't get the device to recognize the album or artist name, try telling it to play a playlist./li   liIf an artist has "The" in the name, say it./li   /ul   <comment208789> If your phone is with you (you have iPhone tagged), create a personal hotspot with it, and use that to get your iPod the wifi connection it needs. <comment208791> @Tyson Unfortunately, I don't, I just tagged it because the iPod touch uses the same apps as the iPhone. Should I take it off? <comment209637> Hmmmm..... that might work as a quick fix for me, but it's pretty unfortunate that you can't select a particular song. I know there's several voice control apps like Vokul, but I can't seem to confirm if any work offline. <comment209638> @pocketlint You could always make one-song playlists. <comment209639> Maybe, but then I have to think ahead to make playlists for each song, and I've got a pretty big library. Still, your solution is the best I've found, so thank you!
