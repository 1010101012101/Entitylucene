How to delete movie from local computer, but not library? <body> I recently bought a movie on iTunes. After watching the movie, I would like to delete it from my local computer, but not from my library, so perhaps I can watch it again in the future. How do I do this?  I know that if I right-click on the movie, there is an option to delete the movie, but I am worried that this will result in the movie being permanently deleted from my library, which is why I don't dare to try it to see if it works.
