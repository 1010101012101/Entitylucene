Macbook Pro Keyboard Functions Stopped Working on Bootcamp <body> I have a MacBook Pro 15" with Mountain Lion 10.8.  I've had the laptop for about 8 months now and I installed Bootcamp probably around a week after I got it. Everything worked perfectly, which was awesome. Installed the support drivers and everything.  Today I booted into Windows and the keyboard functions have stopped working. For instance the keyboard backlights wont work and the volume buttons do nothing. I tried rebooting a few times into mac and back or back into Windows and nothing works.  Anybody run into this sort of things before? Have any suggestions?  Thanks in advance!  <answer92510> It sounds like a drivers issue.  Try re-installing the drivers for Windows and reboot. You can download the drivers from here. Please double check that your version of Windows is 7 64-bit or 8.
