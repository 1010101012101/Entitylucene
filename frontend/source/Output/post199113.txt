WebM Mac OS X and iOS integration (not only play) <body> This question was asked in 2012 at SuperUser. The Perian project is now gone. I found on MacUpdate a QuickTime plugin for WebM. But this site looks like malware.  Howto integrate WebM in Mac OS X (play, preview in finder,..) and iOS?  <comment238498> There is trusted site to download from https://code.google.com/p/webm/downloads/detail?name=WebM%20Component%20Installer.pkg <comment238549> Released: Dec 22, 2010. Doesn't work with new OS X. <comment238562> It is the same file as you showed in MacUpdate !? the site you do not trust.
