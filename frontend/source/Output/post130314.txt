Display IP address in an Automator alert <body> I am running an Automator script to launch SFTP on my Mac when double-clicked. Here’s the script:  precodedo shell script "sudo -s launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ftp.plist" with administrator privileges tell app "Finder" to display alert "SFTP Opened and your IP address is" /code/pre  The alert displayed is:     strongSFTP Opened and your IP address is/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HlMO3.png" alt="Screenshot of alert"  As you can see, the alert message is incomplete because I don’t know how to retrieve the IP address of my system to pass through as a variable in the second line of my code. Any workaround? Please don’t suggest any external tools. And please don’t suggest using Automator’s System variable “IP address” with a separate “Ask for Confirmation” box because I want the IP to be displayed as a part of my existing message in the alert that I am already showing.  <answer130315> You can set a variable containing your IPv4, then append the contents of the variable to the contents of the alert message:  precodeset ipaddress to IPv4 address of (get system info) tell app "Finder" to display alert "SFTP opened and your IP address is " &amp; ipaddress /code/pre
