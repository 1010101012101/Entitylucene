How can I remap the volume buttons for custom use? <body> First of all, I only want to disable the standard volume buttons - I do not want to disable the buttons to change brightness, launchpad...   I need this because I want those buttons to trigger scripts for finer volume adjustment using FastScripts.  <answer42244> h2strongKarabiner/strong (Formerly called strongKeyRemap4MacBook)/strong/h2  allows to intercept the keyplay.  ol liAssign your scripts for fine volume adjustment to kbdF11/kbd and kbdF12/kbd (actually it's a combination of kbdfn/kbd+kbdvol. up/kbd/kbdvol. down/kbd)./li liDownload and install Karabiner./li liOpen the Karabiner preferences via the menu icon, which is a black square (like a keyboard key), somewhere in your menu bar./li liIn the Tab strongChange Key/strong select the options:  ul liVolume Down to F11/li liVolume Up to F12/li liF11 to Volume Down/li liF12 to Volume Up/li /ul  This will strongswitch/strong the behavior of the function keys with the volume keys: Now you can use fine volume adjustment with one touch and the usual volume adjustment usingbr kbdfn/kbd+kbdvol. up/kbd/kbdvol. down/kbd.  Note that there is also an option "Fine grained volume controls" that enables fine grained volume controls by default, so you can do this purely within Karabiner, without any other scripts.  You can find this in the giant list, under "Change F1..F19 Key &amp; Functional Key" and then the submenu "Change Functional Key".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzegB.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  <comment69748> You could also [assign the function keys to arbitrary key combinations in private.xml](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/59315/3936). <comment205930> Kudos for the excellent care and update to Karabiner - thank you @matt
