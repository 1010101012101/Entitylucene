identifying the network activity of a process - Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 <body> Is there a way to identify the network activity for running processes ?  I'm seeing some unusual activity on my computer (late 2008 MacBook Pro )  <answer41325> Yes, quite a few - ranging from the simple to the more complex. Depends on what you're after in terms of detail, but if you want a nice, easy GUI frontend (that ties up process names with activity) then you could use something like Little Snitch or Hands Off!. They are actually firewalls, which have their own network monitors. So if you find something you don't like, you can always block it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iJws5.jpg" alt=""  I also use iStat Menus or iStat Pro (free) which can give you differing view of process and network activity (but not combined like Little Snitch can).  Or for something more detailed you could investigate the terminal codenetstat/code command.  <comment46814> How detailed do you want this? Simply what processes are talking out? Or down to exactly what packets are being sent where? <comment46817> Little Snitch looks like just the thing I was looking for. Thanks for your help. <comment57645> You might want to mention iftop which can be installed through homebrew. It's a free option.
