IPod Classic - music gone <body> I turned on my iPod Classic 128 GB and all music content was gone.  I charged it and the Apple symbol appeared and then it turned on with no songs/music at all.br I have not connected to iTunes at all recently.br Please advise.  kristeen  <answer243496> My old classic used to do that kind of trick to me periodically.br I always suspected that the disk format was not particularly robust.  I found the only way to get it going again was to Restore it in iTunes &amp; reload the whole library again - don't plan on being in a hurry, it takes ages.  One thing I did learn over the years was to always leave the lock button strongon/strong [the little slider at the top, slid to show the red dot underneath] all the time unless I actually needed to interact with it.    Also to strongnever/strong leave it locked if I was about to connect it to iTunes, otherwise it would hang.  Remembering those two would let me run far longer before it played tricks on me the next time.
