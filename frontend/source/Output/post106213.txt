Truncated “Recent Items” Label in OS X Mavericks General Preferences <body> I’ve just upgraded to OS X Mavericks (Build 13A603) and discovered a truncated label in General Preferences. You can see the that the strongRecent Items/strong can’t be read at all.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rbmiy.jpg" alt="enter image description here" title="Truncated Label in OS X Mavericks"  I’ve tried to overwrite the prefpane in, but the problem still remains:   code/System/Library/PreferencePanes/Appearance.prefPane/code.  Do anyone else have the same problem?  <answer107198> I had the same problem, and figured out the solution.  Apparently, for whatever reason, 3rd party hacks or something else, the font size in the preference pane was incorrect. Since there's no way to change the size of emSystem Fonts/em in the GUI, I used the TinkerTool utility to reset to defaults.  It was the emfixed-pitch/em font that was incorrect, and TinkerTool had it highlighted. I just hit the strongSet to default/strong button in TinkerTool's strongFonts/strong tab and that fixed it.  I'm glad I sorted this out and didn't have to re-download the 5+ GB Mavericks Installer!  <comment124846> I have the same partial text under the General group in System Preferences in a newly upgraded Mavericks.
