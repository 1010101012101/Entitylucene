Are there fonts that include note characters? <body> On my Mac, there is a font that contains the "BEAMED EIGHT NOTES" Unicode character, but there are no fonts that contains the "MUSICAL SYMBOL PLUS NOTEHEAD," or the "MUSICAL SYMBOL QUARTER NOTE" Unicode characters.    Are the fonts that contain such characters?  <answer13367> The Musica typeface (available here) has both of the unicode characters you mention; I tested it with the Character Viewer on Mac OS 10.6.6 and it seems to work fine.  <answer13368> Try installing the Musica font from this page.  This will install the musical notes you need (free).  You can then test it out on this page.  Hope this helps.
