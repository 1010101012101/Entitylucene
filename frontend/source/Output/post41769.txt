Possible to access/restore past versions of Notes in iCloud? <body> If I mistakenly delete or otherwise mess up a Note that is stored in iCloud, is there a way to restore a past version of the Note?  <answer41776> Short answer is no :(. That is, unless you can get to the note before iCloud updates it, but that would not be much time at all.  Not that they are in the same class, but one can do that with Time Machine. It allows one to go back through, and it has saved and kept track of the changes that have been made to documents.  <answer268901> Assuming you have 2 devices, let's say an iPhone and iPad, there is only one thing you can do:  ol lidelete something on your iPhone/li lias soon as you notice, enable airplane mode on your iPad/li liunlock iPad &amp; open notes/li licopy note to somewhere else/li liturn off airplane mode/li licopy note back to notes/li /ol  Other than that, there unfortunately doesn't seem to be anything you can do.  <comment47468> Bummer. Please take note of this feature request, Apple! <comment47534> Please don't forget to mark the answer. :) <comment72957> Do you sync iCloud with your Mac AND have a backup of your mac? Or a local backup of your iOS device?
