MacBook Pro CD burning is not permanent <body> I am trying to burn a bootable CD to update my harddisk firmware. This is what I have tried:  Using Disk Utility: pressing burn, selecting the bootable image, speed = maximum possible (24x), verify burned data is checked, pressing burn.br The superdrive spins, makes noises indicating that it's doing something, I get a message "burn succesful", and then the CD is mounted on the Desktop with all the expected contents. I eject the disc, insert it again and it's empty.  Again using Disk Utility: pressing burn, selecting the bootable image, strongspeed = 8x/strong, verify burned data is checked, pressing burn.br The superdrive spins, makes noises indicating that it's doing something, I get a message "burn succesful",  and then the CD is mounted on the Desktop with all the expected contents. I eject the disc, insert it again and it's empty.  Using the open source Burn app: going to Copy tab, dragging iso image in, pressing burn, verify data is checked, speed = 24x.br I get a message that all went well, the CD is mounted on the desktop, all contents are there, but on ejecting and inserting the disc again the disc shows as empty again.    I tried this with 4 Philips discs.  Does anyone know what my problem could be? I'm on a MacBook Pro 5,3 with 10.6.8.  <answer73139> Looking around at different forums I found out that this behaviour might be caused by a dirty lens. I ended up buying this cleaning CD, and after giving it a spin I could burn CD's normally again.  <comment78781> Did you try reusing those *apparently* not written CDs? <comment78783> Yes I tried reburning the same data on these CD's. Both Disk Utility and Burn started the burning process, but ended with an error. Through Burn I tried to burn a mp3 to one of the used CD's. At first it looked as if it worked, but after ejecting the CD and re-entering it, the mp3 was gone.
