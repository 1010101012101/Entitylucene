Using a Creative Live Chat Cam with Skype <body> I am trying to set up a Creative Live Chat Cam on a Mac mini to use with Skype. How do I get this combination to work?  <answer100947> Your Camera is a UVC -Universal Video Camera type.  In English that means you should just plug it in and it will work.  Following steps should do it:  Plug the camera in..  Open Skype  If Skype does not auto-identify the camera (asking you if you want to use it)  Go to the Skype Preferences  Go to the Audio Video  There you should be able to select the camera + Microphone + Speakers  You will see your self if all worked.  <comment118841> The guide on [Ask] will help you refine your question by showing what you've tried and/or what exactly "you don't get".
