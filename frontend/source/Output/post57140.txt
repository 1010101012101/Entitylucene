Looking for a 360° object view iPhone app <body> I'm looking for a 360° iPhone app that models one object from either a level path around the object or perhaps even a true 360 view from any angle looking in at the object.  This is different than the usual panorama 360° that captures what you see from one point in all directions, but one that allows the illusion of a central object to move and not the point of view (camera) moving.  <answer57141> How about 123D Catch? It is free and allows you to turn your photos into a 3D object.  See a demo here.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uE0wg.jpg" alt=""  I just recently found another one called Relievos.      Relievos is a fun and creative tool that turns any picture into a 3D image, just like a sculpture.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMucf.jpg" alt=""  <answer57228> I found the perfect app - haven't tried it yet but will shortly: Youspin  <answer57260> A cool 360° iPhone app is Dermendar.  <comment70040> This does not answer the OP's question. The OP specifically said "not one that records a panorama when you spin the camera 360°". Dermander does exactly that.
