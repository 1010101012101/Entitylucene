VLC won't work after update max OS X 10.10.3 <body> Just update OS X 10.10.3 on my macbook pro VLC 'not responding' when I try to watch a video. I tried to use different media player, same thing happened. Someone help please.  <comment214982> Have you tried to remove and re-install VLC? <comment214983> I did, still doesn't work. I use other player from app store. same thing happened. <comment214984> Try removing VLC with AppCleaner: http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/ <comment214985> I did use AppCleaner <comment214986> So, can you launch the software Ok, but it hangs when you try to play something? Or does it hang as soon as you launch the application. <comment214987> when launch the app, it also will not responding after couples minutes. <comment214988> Do you experience these issues with any other application? <comment214989> Is there anything of interest in `/var/log/system.log` at the point of time the player freezes? Does it happen with one video only or with all? How is/are they encoded? <comment214990> same thing happened when I use different media player. it happened to all videos. <comment214999> I'm tempted to think some old Perian/Flip4Mac plugin hanging around long after its sell-by-date <comment215116> Maybe try this? - http://boinx.com/sandboxcleaner/ & get rid of Perian if you've still got it. It's a) obsolete & b) not required for VLC anyway. Also check Flip4Mac is up to date.
