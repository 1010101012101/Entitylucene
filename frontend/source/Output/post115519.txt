Scapy on Mavericks via Homebrew "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'intf'" <body> I tried to install Scapy on OS X via Homebrew which seemed to work fine.br After installation there were some Python modules missing which I installed via Homebrew.  Now when I start Scapy I get the following error:  precodeINFO: Can't import python gnuplot wrapper . Won't be able to plot.

I cannot guarantee this will work for you, but I've had this problem for the last 2 months, word for word. And now, I can at least get into codescapy/code.  First of all, I found my Python install's paths, with this command:  precodepython -c "import sys; print sys.path" /code/pre  In my case, the first few paths were various .egg files. Try removing the codepydnet/code egg, which in my case is called codePyDNET-0.92-py2.7.egg/code. I haven't really tested it too much at this point, but codescapy/code boots, at least. So we know where the problem must be.  <comment135713> No, that didn't change anything.
