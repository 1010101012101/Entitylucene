How to use external monitor with MacBook Air closed and on battery power? <body> I often use my MacBook Air (running OS X 10.9.5) closed at a docking station, where it's hooked to external monitor, keyboard/trackpad, and power. All good. The only issue is that occasionally the external power will come loose or jostle*, which turns off the external monitor or causes it to flicker. I understand the system is designed to work this way -- no external monitor when closed unless the power is plugged in.   My question is: how to change this default behavior? i.e. keep the external monitor going while closed on battery power?  [*] Why you ask? My loving, atttention-seeking cats.   <answer187915> You can. All you need is an app such as NoSleep.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGsax.png" alt="NoSleep"  <answer261546> In case it helps anyone who isn't comfortable downloading an app for this. I have the exact same need when I forget to bring my AC Adapter to the office, and I've worked around it by simply:  ol liMirroring the 2 displays (MacBook's &amp; external)/li liDimm the MacBook display all the way down to emoff/em (press codeF1/code until the display turns off)/li /ol  I still can't close the lid, but my battery saving needs are met.   <comment222180> put a very heavy weight object on to the magsafe cable right next to the plug <comment222264> THANK YOU! Apple's stupid MagSafe 2 + my cats can coexist. Harmony has been restored to my universe. <comment328624> Came across this thread as I left my charger at home and want to preserve as much power throughout my work day using external monitor. Solid solution. Thanks. <comment348942> does not work for El Capitan, and I think for major versions, error installing pkg file
