Displaying full screen video on only 1 monitor <body> I have a multiple monitor setup. I'd like to be able to play a video full screen on only one of them. It could be Quicktime or a Safari video (mostly Safari/YouTube). Is there any setting to control this at all? Right now the video takes over the screen and the others go black. (Have seen other older answers but no solutions recently.)  <answer237989> Try to disable mirroring in System Preferences  Displays and move application which play video to the screen you want.
