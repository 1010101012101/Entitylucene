Recents on the double click home page <body> Why does the double click home page store recents and how do I delete them?  <answer146542> It's a new feature for iOS 8.  Disable it in the settings app under Mail, Contacts, Calendars  About 2/3 of the way down the settings (swipe up) you can tap on strongShow in App Switcher/strong and decide if you want either favorites or recents.  <comment172651> Huh? You mean Mobile Safari? which iOS version are you using?
