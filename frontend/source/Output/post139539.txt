Xcode word completion shortcut <body> Xcode's code autocompletion is quite good, I am missing one thing though: in vim I can press ctrl+n to autocomplete any word, even those in the comment.  Here is a screenshot from xcode to show what I mean:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfC8E.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am wondering if there is a keyboard shortcut to achieve I am looking for.  <answer139544> codeControlâ€“Space bar/code is used to either turn the Auto-Complete ON/OFF. You can read more about it here  <comment246733> this does not answer the question at all. The question is not how to turn Auto-Complete on or off, but how to autocomplete regular words as opposed to symbols the compiler recognizes.
