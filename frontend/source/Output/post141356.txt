How can I update the firmware in my router via tftp? <body> I'm going to flash my wifi-router with alternative firmware by following these instructions on my Mac but I'm struggling with the step  precodeSet Your server's IP-Address to 192.168.1.15/24 /code/pre  I can't understand, what is this server. Is it DNS-server?  I fI try to change address of DNS-server, than it gets cut to code192.168.1.15/code.  How do I need to set up my Mac to allow the router to fetch the new firmware via tftp?  <answer141383> In order to do this you need your Mac to be connected, by an Ethernet cable, to the router.  In the Network control panel of System Preferences, set the following parameters for your Ethernet connection:  Configure Ipv4: strongManually/strong  IP Address: strong192.168.1.15/strong  Subnet Mask: strong255.255.255.0/strong  Router: strong192.168.1.1/strong  Press the "Apply" button in the control panel.  Now you can run tftp from the OS X Terminal app and follow the instructions on the page you referenced.  <answer141385> As I found out, code192.168.1.15/24/code is IP address written in CIDR (emClassless Inter-Domain Routing/em) notation.  For example:      192.168.100.0/24 represents the given IPv4 address and its associated routing prefix 192.168.100.0, or equivalently, its subnet mask   255.255.255.0   OS X doesn't understand it, so it should be manually converted to IPv4 address and subnet mask using online calculators (there are many).  <answer141386> code192.168.1.15/24/code is a so-called slash notation, which specifies both the IP address and the network mask at the same time. It's an alternative but shorter notation, which says: your Mac's IP address should be set to code192.168.1.15/code and the network mask to code255.255.255.0/code.   In addition to that, you will need to enable the tftp server on your Mac. To do that, look for code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist/code file. If you find it, you need to edit it, to enable launching the tftp server. Edit the file with your favourite editor (codesudo vi/code or codesudo nano/code should do - this is all best done in the codeTerminal.app/code). Inside the file, you'll find the following lines:   precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  change these to be:   precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Disabled&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;false/&gt; /code/pre  After you make that change, you'll need to run the following command in Terminal.app, to start the tftp service:   codesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist/code  You will then need to put your firmware file into code/private/tftpboot/code, make sure it's world readable (in Terminal.app run codechmod 644 /private/tftpboot/filename/code where codefilename/code is the name of the file containing your firmware) and finally point your router to the location of the file, according to your router's instructions.   <comment166623> You shouldn't need to edit /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/tftp.plist -- the `-w` flag to `sudo launchctl load` makes it override that setting.
