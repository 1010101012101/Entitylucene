How to reduce MacBook Air 2013 1.7GHz CPU power consumption? <body> I'm seeking a way to reduce MacBook Air 2013 1.7GHz CPU power consumption -- or any MacBook for that matter -- to save battery life.  I want to vary the CPU power consumption variably, so that I can get "full speed" when I want and "better/best power savings" at other times.  Something akin to Linux's cpuspeed command (to reduce CPU clock frequency) would be helpful, but could be anything.  Note I'm seeking CPU-only power-consumption tips.  Please do not clutter answers with tips for non-CPU things like display brightness, avoiding Adobe Flash, employing different web browsers, etc.  <answer99022> Have you thought about using Appriority? It allows you to suspend and enable CPU usage as you switch between apps.  <answer99023> I think the upcoming Mavericks OS update is supposed to help somewhat. http://www.apple.com/osx/preview/advanced-technologies.html
