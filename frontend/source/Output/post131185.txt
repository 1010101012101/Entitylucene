How to switch horizontal and vertical scrolling directions <body> I would like to know how to switch horizontal and vertical scrolling in OS X 10.9, i.e. when rolling the ball to the left to make the screen go down, and when rolling right to make the screen go up.  Question is strongnot/strong how to switch horizontal/vertical direction! Question is how to switch axes codex/code and codey/code.  Does anyone know how to do that? Thanks in advance!  <answer131186> System Preferences  Mouse  Scroll direction check box will be at the top of that window.  <comment154021> you are short worded, give us bit more please, make it 2 line answer. <comment154022> I edited it slightly, but I really doubt this needs a longer answer. I'm not really sure what you think I should elaborate on? <comment154026> I know, we just like the more descriptive answers :) <comment154151> Scroll direction checkbox swaps up & down directions. What I'm asking is how to swap `x` and `y` axes. <comment154436> Hold your mouse sideways?!? <comment154442> @BugsBunny for the trackpad, it switches both x,y. I just tested it. If you are using a logitech rollerball type mouse, the answer may lie within that preference pane.
