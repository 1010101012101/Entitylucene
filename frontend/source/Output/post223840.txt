Trying to install nasm-2.1108 but getting permission deny <body> Trying to install my nasm version as 2.11.08 but when i hit the "sudo make install" im getting error like this  precode$ sudo make install mkdir -p /usr/bin /usr/bin/install -c nasm /usr/bin/nasm install: /usr/bin/nasm: Operation not permitted make: *** [install] Error 71 /code/pre  how can i resolve this problem im running Elcapitan on my mac.  current nasm version:  NASM version 0.98.40 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 11) compiled on Aug 17 2015  <answer223843> User-provided binaries should get installed to code/usr/local//code (or more specifically code/usr/local/bin/code) to avoid any versioning conflicts with standard applications/binaries. There should be an option to set the install directory to code/usr/local/code when you run code./configure/code in your build directory.  PS: In OS X before El Capitan, it was rather easy to install to code/usr/bin/code nevertheless. With El Capitan, Apple has introduced SIP to prevent these kind of modifications. There are ways to disable SIP, but I recommend to install to code/usr/local/code instead.  <comment271365> i disabled sip because i couldnt figure out how to change configure file thanks for advice, right now with disabling SIP i upgraded nasm version
