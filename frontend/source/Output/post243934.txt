How to sort photos inside a photo album in the Photos app on an iPhone by date [PC]? <body> By default the photos in user-created albums are sorted by date added, NOT date taken. The user may rearrange the photos one-by-one (tap and hold).  I do NOT own a Mac.  <answer243944> I never thought about that, but it seems like this is not possible at the moment, take a look at this Apple Forum's question answered, this may help you understand more about how photos work on the iPhone and where you can contact Apple to leave a feedback about what you've just asked here, give it a try!  <answer245642> I have had the same question for years. Unfortunately, iOS uses Date Added and not Date Taken from EXIF for sorting. They even added Collections but Camera Roll sorting is still broken.br To sort the photos you could use one of the methods:br 1)Jailbreak. A number of tweaks allow organising photos one by one or sorting by name/date. You would also be able to edit each photo's metadata on device.br 2)Sync them as an album from a computer. First, organise them by copying or otherwise modifying the date metadata, then sync the resulting folder through iTunes. This is limited to the synced album and will not fix the camera roll.br 3)Make changes to Photos.sqlite. This should work unless Apple modifies databases. This is sort of the best option available without resorting to mass EXIF editing. Details are here.br   I am still avoiding using this method, as many of my photos are saved from iMessage/elsewhere and might not have the correct date taken data. Also, it won't sort your videos.
