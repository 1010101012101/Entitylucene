"You can’t sign in at this time" when signing into iCloud <body> I recently upgraded my fairly new MacBook Pro to OS X 10.11 (El Capitan). I started the Notes app, hoping to see my notes, but they weren't there. I clicked on iCloud in the Settings app and typed my Apple ID and password, and a dialog box showed saying "You can’t sign in at this time. Try signing in again.".  I am sure I am typing the right Apple ID and password because I can log in from my phone, and I can log in from the iCloud website.  I tried deleting my ~/Library/Application Support/iCloud/Accounts directory as described here and that didn't seem to do anything.  I tried the procedure described here and that didn't work either.  Why is this happening? What can be done about it?  <answer210045> ol liEnsure that all Apple Systems are up and working through the this link/li liContact Apple Support as they often have support documentation that is not available to public view (source: Former Apple Employee). They will escalate the issue to an Engineer (then Senior Engineer) until a fix is in place. Use this link/li /ol  <answer210265> I called Apple Support. We tried several things. Eventually, I started Keychain Access, and under the "Keychain Access" menu, clicked "Preferences". In the Preferences, I clicked the "Reset My Default Keychain" button. I had to re-enter my Mac and iCloud passwords. Everything appears to be working fine now.  <answer288449> my experience with this issue was a bit of a "Doh!" moment. I was trying to sign on using my username "@me.com". As soon as I switched to "@icloud.com" everything worked great.   <comment253447> All of the systems were working according to that link. I will try Apple Support when I have a chance. <comment253769> Awesome! A bad entry in the keychain can be hard to think of and suss out. <comment259640> Hey I tried your way, but I cannot still log in.. <comment295186> Where can I find my old keychain? :( Unfortunately it also delete my secure notes. :( <comment295187> Ah! Found it in `~/Library/Keychains` it's named `login_renamed_1.keychain` <comment340077> wow, resolved, thanks!
