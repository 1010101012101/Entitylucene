Is there a way to make Preview not open all previously opened files? <body> Usually when I use Preview, it is when I see a code.jpg/code or code.png/code and I double click on the file to take a look at the file, but sometimes Preview will open up all the code.pdf/code and code.png/code I opened previously, possibly taking up a couple hundred of MB and opening 7 or 8 windows.  So it is a case I hope an app will not open all previously opened files.  I know it can be done by clicking File, pressing kbdOption/kbd, and then choosing Close All, but is there a way to tell an app not to open all previously open files such as for the case of Preview?  <answer54855> One way is to use the old adage, leave it as you expect to find it!  If you have several windows open when you close it, then those windows will open next time.  If you close the windows before you close the app, then next time you should have no windows.  So, if you are using kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + Q to quit the app with open windows, try using kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + W before doing so to closing the currently open windows.  Other than that you are just seeing the normal "resume" features at work.  <answer54856> This is part of strongresume/strong. A feature introduced with Lion.  Per default, windows are restored the next time you open the application. If you want to completly close all windows strongjust one time/strong, you can quit an application using kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdQ/kbd instead of the standard kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdQ/kbd to quit an application.  h2Undo resume for a specific application/h2  Type the following command in the Terminal. Then restart the specific application.  In general the syntax is:  precodedefaults write com."producer"."program-name" ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  Thus, in your case (Preview.app) it is:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Preview ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES /code/pre  If you prefer a graphical interface, you can use strongTinkerTool/strong.  This application gives you access to additional preference settings and allows to activate hidden features in the operating system.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rVqx.png" alt="enter image description here"  h2Undo resume for all applications/h2  In order to disable this for all applications do this:  go to strongSystem Preferences-General-Restore windows when quitting.../strong  <answer54868> In addition to the other answers you an also use kbdOption ⌥/kbd + kbdCommand ⌘/kbd + Q when you close preview instead of Command-Q which will ensure that it does not remember which files it had open.  <answer55154> If you want to DISABLE restore for a particular application, you can close all open documents for a program, quit the program, then go to ~/Library/Saved Application State/«app name», Get Info, and lock the folder.  This could work to preserve the state of "no windows open", or, as a bonus, you could use this to preserve any other window state that you always want to launch into.  <comment62901> @動靜能量 For something that integrates a little more seamlessly with Lion, check out [RestoreMeNot](http://www.restoremenot.info/). It's just a settings pane as opposed to a standalone application. <comment71878> I assume there is no way to keep the restore feature but act as if I closed all windows when I manually exit an application? <comment75874> @dualed If you want to keep the restore feature, but act as if you closed all windows **just this one time**, you can use CMD+ALT+Q to quit. <comment79158> @gentmatt thanks, +1, I would have preferred a solution that is not using a different shortcut, but I guess this will do.
