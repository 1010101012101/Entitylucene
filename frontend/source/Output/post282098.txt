How does macOS determine what CPU it will run on? <body> We've all heard of the Hackintoshes and how they've been becoming more prevalent. My question is this:  Does macOS limit the processors it will run on by SKU or by architecture? e.g. If I have a dual-socket motherboard using a pair of Skylake Xeons, will macOS run on it since it runs on the i7-6700K in the iMac?  Just curious. I might even build an uber-Mac Pro
