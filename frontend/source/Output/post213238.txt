Setting Option+[WIFI ICON MENUBAR CLICK] as default action when clicking the wifi icon in the menu bar <body> Clicking on the Wifi icon in the menu bar while pressing and holding the codeoption/code key presents the user with a different and detailed view. The codeoption/code-key is a nice feature. It works on a lot of the menu bar icons as well (sound and bluetooth).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tXftf.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'd be nice if I could set this feature as the default action when interacting with those menu bar items.  strongHow can I set this to be the default action on El Capitan?/strong  <answer213971> Until now I've only found a workaround:  Install BetterTouchTool and create a special trackpad gesture or mouse gesture to invoke an kbdoption/kbd+click. In the example below I use the trackpad and a 3 finger double-tap in strongemGlobal/em/strong to do that:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zcWMm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  From now on a 3 finger double-tap on the Wi-Fi menulet (and other menulets) will reveal the advanced or detailed view.  <comment258689> creative solution though I'd probably want to opt for pressing the keyboard button than install a new software to handle one thing. Regardless, Thanks for your contribution! I may consider it in the end
