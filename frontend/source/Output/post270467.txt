Can't access application directory files on iOS from PC <body> I have some enterprise app installed on a bunch of iPads. Now I need to copy SQLite DB files from them to PC (using iExplorer or iFunbox). There is no problem for the most of the devices, but some of them show me the following while I try to get into app's folder:  img src="https://dl3.joxi.net/drive/2017/01/26/0016/2527/1071583/83/edb26bce11.jpg" alt="loading"  Is there any security restriction or else in iOS that can deny access?  <comment339905> I suspect the app has the files open
