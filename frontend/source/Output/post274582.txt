Alternative for RealVNC? <body> I'm searching for a free alternative of RealVNC for Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11).  I have one "special need" for the program. I need to be able to change the port of the Mac I am currently using.   I couldn't find anything yet, at least nothing that works with El Capitan...  Any recommendations?  <answer274587> h1VNC Clients/h1  If you are looking for a VNC client, the open source Chicken client supports connecting to specific ports.  Alternatively, you can use macOS's built in strongScreen Sharing/strong application to connect to specific ports via a well formed URL, such as codevnc://192.168.1.34:5901/code.  h1VNC Servers/h1  For VNC servers, other than the built-in macOS VNC server, take a look at Tiger VNC. You can install Tiger VNC via the brew project with:  precodebrew install tiger-vnc /code/pre  h2Tunneling/h2  You could take a different approach and tunnel the existing VNC service through codessh/code or another tool. This would expose the VNC service through any port you desire without needing a special VNC server.
