How can I access the remote clipboard when Screen Sharing into a Linux system <body> I am using Screen Sharing to do vnc to my work computer running Linux,  however the Edit - Cut,Copy, Paste,Delete commands are all greyed out.  Is there some way to enable these options ?   On a related question, I could get text from one vnc window to the clipboard when highlighted with the mouse, and can paste to the same vnc window, but I can't paste the same text to another vnc window... as if the clipboard isn't updating. Seems each vnc window remembers its own clipboard updates only,  which is not what I want. Would prefer clipboard info to be available to all vnc windows, is this possible ?  <answer219586> There's a program called codevncconfig/code that makes clipboard integration work. Just run it in your sever like:  precodevncconfig &amp; /code/pre  And now it works. Kind of a miserably named program though. Another tip is to add codevncconfig &amp;/code to your code~/.vnc/xstartup/code script so you always have it.  <comment40060> Usually it's better to only ask one question in one post, but in your case they are obviously related. My guess would be that remote clipboard access is not compatible between the VNC server running on your Linux machine and Screen Sharing. <comment40133> clipboard cut and paste does work well with the windows version... i'll just have to stick with this for now (or write my own app for this :)) thnx. <comment293349> More info about enabling clipboard via vncconfig in Superuser StackExchange: http://superuser.com/questions/376877/copy-paste-clipboard-like-functionality-from-a-vnc-desktop.
