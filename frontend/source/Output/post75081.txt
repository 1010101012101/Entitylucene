Automatically change OS X desktop background for all desktops + monitors? <body> strongSummary/strong. Automation changes desktop background for all (virtual) desktops, but no all monitors.  How to do it for all monitors?  strongDetails/strong.  This blog entry discusses how to automatically change background for all (virtual / Mission Control / etc) desktops with following script:  precode#! /bin/bash #script to change all desktop backgrounds echo -n “Drag and drop an image file here then press ‘return’ or press ‘control-c’ to cancel…” read -e WLPR; function change_wallpaper { defaults write com.apple.desktop Background "{default = {ImageFilePath='$WLPR'; };}"; killall Dock } change_wallpaper /code/pre  However, it doesn't change the desktop background on my 2nd monitor on my Lion-based system for any of my Mission-Controlled desktops.  How does one apply above (or similar) to emall/em physical monitors?  (Hacks like this unattractive.)  <answer75092> I'm afraid this isn't a complete answer, since I haven't yet found a way to make this work with multiple desktops, but it will set the desktop of all monitors in the current space to whatever picture you specify.  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set theFile to first item of input     tell application "System Events"         set theDesktops to a reference to every desktop         repeat with aDesktop in theDesktops             set the picture of aDesktop to theFile         end repeat     end tell     return theFile end run /code/pre  Add that to a strongRun AppleScript/strong action in an Automator workflow, and save it as an application. You can then drag and drop an image onto the application and it will be set as the desktop image.  Perhaps someone can find a way to make this work with multiple spaces/desktops.  <answer103039> I have dual monitor Mac at work so I will be able to give it a try tomorrow (day off today).  I think if you were to compare the output of:  precode$ defaults read com.apple.desktop /code/pre  Before and after having manually changed the wallpaper via:  emSystem Preferences  Desktop &amp; Screen Saver  Desktop/em  That, should, bring up a window in the second display allowing you to select required image. Once that is setup and working, compare the output from the original command and see if it gives you any clues. I shall do the same tommorow and play around it with it. See if I can't give you a more complete answer.  <answer276476> On my system (10.12) codedefaults read com.apple.desktop/code gave codeDomain com.apple.desktop does not exist/code  The following link gives me 2 ideas: https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/mavericks-desktop-background-picture-settings-moved-from-librarypreferencescom-apple-desktop-plist/  The 1st idea: Change the link of DefaultDesktop: Therefore you need to temporary disable codeSystem Integrity Protection/code (https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/214540/156148), to change the symlink under code/System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg/code  precode#! /bin/bash if [ -z "$1" ]; then     echo "Please specify an absolute path to an image as first parameter"     exit -1 fi mv /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg.backup ln -s $1 /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg /code/pre  The 2nd idea:  precode#! /bin/bash #script to change all desktop backgrounds if [ -z "$1" ]; then     echo "Please specify an absolute path to an image as first parameter"     exit -1 fi  osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to set picture of every desktop to \"$1\"" killall Dock /code/pre
