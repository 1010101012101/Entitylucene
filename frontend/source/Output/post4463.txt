Flash plugin crashes frequently <body> In various websites, at random times and with no apparent pattern, the Flash plugin will crash. This has occurred in every browser, and I typically have at least one crash a day. According to Mozilla's plugin check I have the latest version of Flash (10.1.102.64)  This is a new MacBook Pro (17", 2010 unibody version) running fully updated Mac OS X 10.6.5.  Does the plugin just crash for everyone, or is this unique to me? How often does Flash crash for you? Is there anything I can check, or is there a way I can reinstall Flash or some other diagnosis I can run? I haven't been experiencing other issues with my computer or my browser.  <answer4467> Flash on the Mac is the single-largest cause of Safari crashes. That's just the way it is.  <answer4505> There's a reason why Apple appears to onlookers to be so anti-Flash, and it's because Flash sucks on Macs (it may also suck on other OSs, but I don't use them enough to be knowledgeable).   What to do about it depends on what browser you use (your question doesn't say, as Mozilla's Plugin Check isn't FF-only):  ul listrongSafari/strong - the answer is ClickToFlash. Honestly, C2F is something that should just come pre-installed on every Mac./li listrongFirefox/Camino/strong - As Ken mentioned in a comment, you want the FlashBlock extension./li listrongChrome/strong - use the FlashBlock for Chrome extension./li /ul  As has already been said: you can get along fine on almost all sites without Flash. Here's some additional recommended reading, both of which are from John Gruber at Daring Fireball:  ul liGoing Flash-Free on Mac OS X, and How to Cheat When You Need It/li liMasquerading as Mobile Safari to Get Websites to Serve HTML5 Video to Safari on Mac OS X/li /ul  <answer15788> I recently found FlashVideoReplacer for Firefox.  It replaces Flash videos with native players like Quicktime when available.  Flash is a CPU killer for me, so this helps.  <answer15791> Flash crashed so often for me, I have gone flash free and only use flash in Google Chrome browser. Google installs flash within that one app, updates flash behind the scenes and Safari hasn't crashed once in 6 months.  I would recommend three useful and stable Safari extensions if you disable flash in Safari:  ul liYouTube5/li liHTML5 Audio/li liH.264 Flickr Video/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WkjMP.png" alt="Safari Extensions"  <comment4282> When I'm using it for something, it crashes for me at least once a day.  Even when it works, it's usually pretty slow.  That's why I use FlashBlock.  None of the websites that I use need it. <comment4306> Indeed. I would just add that you should simply uninstall flash and if a site uses it, write to the author and complain. <comment4356> +1 for Going Flash-Free. I’ve done that and I love it. When I see the missing plug-in I laugh. Sometimes when I have to, there’s always chrome :) <comment4410> Great suggestion, I don't know why I didn't think of this before! I installed FlashBlock (I'm a Firefox user) and it's simply awesome. This is a great "solution" to the Flash problem. <comment17192> Good advice, thanks!
