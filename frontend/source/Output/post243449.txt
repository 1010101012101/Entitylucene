Will an iphone in lost mode enable celular data on its own? <body> My iphone has been put into lost mode by some hackers like this.  I have regained access of my iCloud account and removed the lost mode from there however the phone has not updated yet because I always have cellular data disabled(because I dont have a plan for it) and I see that its not connecting to wifi.   I can get 10MB data for a day from the Cell company.  My question is: Will iOS enable Cellular data on its own while in lost mode?  I have an iphone 4 with ios 7  <answer243485> This link may help you determine the answer to that question.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19299  In this article, you will see the following. Hopefully this answers your question.     ol start="7"   liIf you used Lost Mode, when tracking begins, you see your device’s current location, as well as any changes in its location on the map.      If your device is online img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m47pq.png" alt="enter image description here" when   you put it in Lost Mode or lock it, it locks and tracking begins (if   applicable). If Location Services is turned off on the device, it’s   temporarily turned on to track your device’s location. A confirmation   email is sent to your Apple ID email address.      If your device is offline img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i0eQK.png" alt="enter image description here",   the passcode lock and tracking (if applicable) take effect the next   time it’s online./li   /ol
