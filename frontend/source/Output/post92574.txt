how to move windows between desktop screens <body> I like to use three fingers swipe right and left to move between different screens. But how should i move currently opened windows to particular desktops of my liking?  <answer92575> Open up Mission Control.  It can be found in your Applications folder or you can activate it with a 3-finger swipe up. This gives you an overview of your open windows and desktops. You can the drag and drop windows between desktops.  more info: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4689  <answer92580> You can also pick up the window you want to move, drag it to the edge of the screen and hold it there until the next/previous desktop slides into view.
