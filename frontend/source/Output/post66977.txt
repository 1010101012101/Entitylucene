iPhone 5: Does the Wahoo Key work with the Classic-to-Lightning adapter? <body> I have a Wahoo Fisica Key I use for sports. It’s is a small dongle that enables sports apps to connect to heart rate monitors, pedometers, etc. It goes into my iPhone 4 classic iPhone 30-pin-connector.  Wahoo’s website obviously says it does not work with the iPhone 5, but I assume this is just for the physical incompatibility of 30-pin and Lightning. When upgrading from iPhone 4 to iPhone 5, will the sensor work with the 30-pin/Lightning adapter?   <answer67205> Yes it does. According to Wahoo Support, one would be     ... able to use the lightning adapter to continue using our Wahoo Key.   This would add about an inch to the bottom of the iPhone.   <answer81511> I have a Wahoo key and a lightning adapter and it does not work.  <comment78954> I have no idea, but FYI Wahoo has a heart rate monitor which works without dongle on the iPhone4s + iPhone5. <comment78956> Thanks @Gerry. I have just recently shelled out 115 US$ for this thing, and would prefer to keep it a while. Not only do I use a heart rate monitors, but also a stride sensor, and would hate to replace them both just for the privilege to use an iPhone 5... <comment94471> Have you contacted Wahoo about this? If they say it does, it should, right?
