My network works perfectly for hours but not overnight <body> My nework works great for hours, then I lose the two remote Airport Express units, find the TC has changed From Ethernet mode to WiFi mode, and have to use the Time Capsule to re create my network, all Apple.  My network starts with a Netgear 220 Modem/Router, connected to the Time Capsule which feeds two Airport Express units and my iMac. The Time Capsule is set in Ethernet mode. All three have the same network name, same password and are all in Bridge mode.  <comment367593> Error - its actually a Netgear DM200, not 220 [connected to my CenturyLink DSL line]
