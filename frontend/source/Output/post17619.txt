Wifi drops on iPad <body> Often when switching apps on the iPad, the Internet connection drops, And the only way to solve is to switch the wifi off and then on again.  This doesn't happen to my iPhone/MacBook on the same network.  Is there anything in the wifi settings, or router settings that I can change to fix it?  hr  <comment19301> Try forgetting your network connections and setting them back up again. You can do this under _General_ - _Reset_ - _Reset Network Settings_. I've had to do this every once in a blue moon to get things working right (with no good reason as to why things failed), but since then, things have been working fine. Just make sure you don't reset anything else!!! ;-) <comment55175> Possibly related to iOS 5.1 problems [related here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3812929?start=960&tstart=0).
