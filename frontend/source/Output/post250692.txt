Can't use or change my system password. Lion 10.7.5 <body> I've been having password problems for the past month or so. I first noticed that I couldn't update Flash because the installer rejected my system password. Today I tried to solve the problem, looking online for fixes, but nothing has worked so far.  ol liTried to reset my password on the "Users &amp; Groups" System Preferences pane./li liRestarted holding kbdOption/kbd at the boot chimes  "Recovery HD"  "Mac OS X Utilities"  "Utilities"  "Terminal". Entered codereset password/code on the command line. Kept terminal open. Completed the "Reset Password" pane. "Password not saved. You may not have permission to edit this disk or a general failure has occurred."/li liRestarted in "Single-User Mode": kbdCommand/kbd+kbdS/kbd at boot chimes. In the command line I entered:  precodemount -uw / launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist dscl . passwd /Users/myusername mypassword reboot /code/pre  After this third attempt, I attempted to install some software and received the following message: "An error prevented the installation of .... Authorization failed. 100022"./li /ol  I also used Disk Utility on my "Macintosh HD" to verify and repair permissions, which was successful; however, when I tried to verify and repair the disk itself, I got "Incorrect number of thread records (4, 24418)".  I purchased a new SSD and battery earlier this summer, knowing that I would have to clone my existing HDD to the new drive, but now I can't do much of anything without my password. If I could get a working password, I could try to repair my HDD with DiskWarrior.  Here's another question: how can I create a "Repair Disk Partition" on my new SSD, using existing 10.7 software? Here's an article which seems to say the Disk Utility can do it: "OS X: About Recovery Disk Assistant" https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202294.  If I only had a password! Thank you all in advance for your wisdom.  <answer251414> Perhaps try enabling the root user from single user mode?  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist passwd root /code/pre  https://www.personalmacgeniuses.com/2013/10/31/case-of-the-missing-admin-account/#.V8qUxGW_2AU  <comment311626> Enable the root account from single user mode. Also dont use dscl but use passwd instead.
