What are the restrictions of ad-hoc code signing? <body> It is possible to sign code or apps "ad-hoc" using codecodesign/code. The man page tells us the following about ad-hoc code signing:     If identity is the single letter "-" (dash), ad-hoc signing is performed.  Ad-hoc signing does not use an identity at all, and identifies exactly one instance of code. strongSignificant restrictions apply to the use of ad-hoc signed code; consult documentation before using this./strong   em(Emphasis added by me)/em  I wanted to know more and tried to find said documentation, but I was unable to find any details. I have found a technical note called "macOS Code Signing In Depth", but it does not mention ad-hoc signing at all.  What are these "significant restrictions" and where are they documented?
