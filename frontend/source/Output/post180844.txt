How do I close this question as duplicate? <comment215111> I think you need to call a moderator by flagging. Or just delete it. <comment215395> You can't flag this as a duplicate of a question on a different site. You could just leave this here, since it's specific to OS X. Arguably the other could be closed as off topic in favor of this one. Or, you could delete your question. <comment215669> @ Chris Page, I am unable to delete the question since it has answers. I'll just leave it then.
