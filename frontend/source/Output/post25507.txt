How can I add static route? <body> How can I add a static route "forever", that means without retyping codeadd route/code in Terminal each time I'm using VPN? I found this solution for 10.6, but what if there is a nicer one for 10.7?  <answer25511> I would use Lingon to script this as a system startup - you can always use launchd to load or unload the job from the command line (or delete the route).  You don't emneed/em Lingon, it just makes it so much more friendly to assemble a plist that launchd likes to run.  <comment42159> It appears that [just adding a route script isn't enough](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37139/setting-a-static-route-every-boot-with-launchd-plist-is-failing) and some smarts on the timing of the command is needed for route to work reliably as a LaunchDaemon.
