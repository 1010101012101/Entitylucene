Google enabled Chat on iPhone <body> strongDoes Google have an iPhone app that supports Googel Talk \ Gmail chat?/strong  Google says:     No need to download or install anything. Start chatting from your   iPhone's browser at: http://www.google.com/talk   However for me that link doesn't give chat, but redirects to a help page...  <answer76322> ul liThere is a google Talk application (unofficial) :  https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/chat-for-google-talk-pro-push/id426339333?mt=8/li liOr here at Mashable they wrote an article about a couple apps that let you use google talk on the iPhone : http://mashable.com/2012/08/27/google-talk-iphone-apps//li /ul  <answer134413> Since this question was asked, Google released their Google Hangouts app which does exactly that.  <comment97839> We have a guide on [ask] that might assist you in explaining in more detail what you don't get. For me, that page has a "technical requirements" link as option 2 that clearly says you need a computer OS and not iOS to use talk. What makes you think that link is meant to work on iPhones with iOS? <comment107624> FYI (for future readers): The Google talk application shared is not an official one from Google.
