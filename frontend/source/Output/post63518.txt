Mouse not Working, need to operate Mouse through Keyboard <body> I have been working on my computer and my Mouse has stopped working. Its optical light is still on, but the cursor is not moving.  But i have no time fix mouse. I am in real emergency to operate the mouse. In my college times, i have heard of 'Moving and dragging mouse cursor with Keyboard keys'. But i dont know how to do that.  Anyone having knowledge about how to operate mouse cursor with Keyboard keys. Help would be appreciated.  <answer63519> You need to enable Mouse Keys under the Mouse &amp; Keyboard section in the Accessibility pane in System Preferences.  This allows you to move the mouse using the keyboard number pad (hold the Option key + number pad key)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9b57M.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer100461> we have had this issue for months - carried out all the tricks mentioned here and at other forums - had some temp luck but the fault always came back- last night we ran a virus scan and pick up and we removed the virus's - low and be hold the mouse has started working again.  what we noted was the computer had started to slow down , not much but it was notable, the odd wierd thing would happen now and again ,then the mouse stopped working , - any way all is good now after the scan and dumping them into the trash  <comment73422> Maybe just unplugging and replugging the mouse helps as well, or a reboot. <comment73424> It doesnt work on reboot. is there any shortcuts on keyboard to operate mouse cursor. <comment73428> Maybe the mouse itself is broken.  Think you can buy or borrow another mouse? <comment73429> I dont that much time to visit market and buy a new one. Need to operate mouse now. <comment73432> How do you operate your computer right now then (without the mouse)? <comment73435> Found the solution. press SHIFT+ALT+NUMLOCK. Click YES on the dialog box to enable sticky keys. Now i am operating the mouse with numeric keys of the keyboard.  Move combinations for keyboard. Up-8 Down-2 left-4 right-6 click-5 hold-0 It works. <comment133360> That doesn't appear to be a Mac answer.
