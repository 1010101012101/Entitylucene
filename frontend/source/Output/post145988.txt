iOS 8 Family Sharing on, but not showing shared purchases <body> After my wife and I upgraded our devices to iOS 8, I turned on a family sharing account so we could use those features.   It's on, and shows up on both of our phones as being part of a family. I also see the shared reminders and calendar. Also, her devices show up in my Find my iPhone.   What doesn't show up is purchases. If I go to iTunes or to the App Store, under purchased, I do not see her, nor any area for family purchases. It looks as it always has.   We have two totally separate iTunes accounts, always have.   Also, as a note - I have gone through everything on Apple's support page (http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5449) and no changes. Basically, it notes to make sure you are logged into the right accounts, everyone is set up to share, and the apps support it.   <answer145996> Download a new free app &amp; see if it jogs the server.

On the iPad, I got to show my other family members by completely quitting the iTunes Store and App Store apps (two press the home button and swipe up to quit the app).  Once I reopened the app, the family members started showing up.  <comment172087> This worked, thank you! Right after I downloaded a free app, I checked both and they were right there immediately. <comment172123> Do you have the name of the free app that you downloaded? I am having the same issue. <comment172176> Anything. You just need to jog its elbow, wake it up.
