Where is the Display Calibrator Assistant on my hard drive? <body> I'd like to use the strongDisplay Calibrator Assistant/strong without going through the process of opening the system preferences.  strongDoes anyone know where the program is located on my hard drive?/strong  I've done a search for various keywords without being able to find it.  <answer159211> The app can be found at this path:  precode/System/Library/ColorSync/Calibrators/Display Calibrator.app /code/pre  To run directly from Terminal type:  precodeopen -a /System/Library/ColorSync/Calibrators/Display\ Calibrator.app /code/pre  This will pop-up a small window on every monitor you have connected.   <comment187153> Thanks -- I added it to my dock.
