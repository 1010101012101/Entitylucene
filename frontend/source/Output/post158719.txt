Space number in menubar <body> Is there a way to show the space number in the menubar so you can easily tell which desktop you are on in yosemite?  <answer164419> TotalSpaces is a good alternative: http://totalspaces.binaryage.com/  TotalSpaces2 have an icon in menubar, like Spaces in Snow Leopard. More intelligent and more powerful application, as the factory default. You can define a grid of spaces, and you can use your fullscreen apps in a new row… This program now available from $18, but the two weeks long trial period is free. See the intro: http://cdn.binaryage.com/totalspaces2-intro.mp4  <comment186581> Let's see whether things improved since Lion (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17982/show-space-desktop-number-in-mac-os-x-lion-in-desktop-top-bar?rq=1) <comment192762> Answers should be more than just a link to some webpage. We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Please don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations.. <comment192781> I have a different background for each space, letting me see which one is which. <comment192994> Ok. Thanks. I will write a lot of words…  (and, if the site will be dead he can't download the program in the words…) :-)
