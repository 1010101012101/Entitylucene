Remove ubuntu on macbook <body> I just inherited an old macbook a1226  The os is single Linux 1.99-ubuntu3.10  It is broken (os) for some reason  I'd like to restore IT some sort of OS X native os installed onto IT.  I have tried option c, option r, c on boot to boot on snow Leopard cd... None worked  I am stuck on grub command line and I am lost.  <comment205530> Option key on boot is not showing me external cd ... <comment205532> I am not totally stupid for a veggie grower, i wouldnt mind using grub command Lines to run this snow Leopard cd, i i cant figure out how...as i'm not familiar with command lines in general, if a sweet one of you can guide me step by step, I would be so incredibly grateful
