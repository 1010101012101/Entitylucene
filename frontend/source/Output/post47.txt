Keyboard needs to be setup on every boot up <body> I am being asked to setup my keyboard every time I reboot my computer. Is there anyway I can get this to keep the setup?  I am on Snow Leopard and have a Logitech Wave wireless keyboard and mouse combo. This started happening when I switched to 64-bit mode. Booting into 32-bit mode doesn't fix it.  <answer411> Um, standard "stock" fixes:  ul liRepair permissions/li liCheck logs/li liErase (Logitech) software and reinstall/li /ul  You could also see if it is actually saving the connection details (by finding the pref file) or it is unable to.   <answer599> Repair permissions: Run Disk Utility; select your (main) disk; click Repair Disk Permissions  Viewing logs: Run Console  <comment393> How do I repair permissions and where are the logs? <comment441> Is it a bluetooth keyboard? And does this Apple link http://support.apple.com/kb/TA23441?viewlocale=en_US by chance help at all? <comment472> No, it has it's own receiver. <comment616> Repairing permissions seemed to work! Thanks!
