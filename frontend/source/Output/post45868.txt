iPhoto not recognizing memory card, but mounts in Finder <body> I am running Lion with most recent version of iPhoto.  I can access the memory card in Finder without problem, but when I launch iPhoto the card does not show up to import photos it contains. I have tried rebuilding my entire iPhoto database and settings by pressing kbdoption/kbd+kbdcommand/kbd while the app is in the process of starting and selecting to rebuild.   Any ideas?  <answer45888> Connect the memory card and launch the program strongImage Capture/strong (found in the strongUtilities/strong folder in both code/Applications//code or in Launchpad, if you're running Lion. In the lower left corner of the screen, there should be a menu that says emConnecting this camera opens.../em; from the menu, select strongiPhoto/strong from the list.  This emshould/em make iPhoto launch when you connect this memory card. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p0NIf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer99670> I had the same problem where my camera stopped appearing in iPhoto. It turned out that the problem was the camera contained too many photos (more than 1000) and I was just being impatient. When I waited for 4-5 minutes it finally appeared. Usually I don't have so many photos on the camera and I was used to it appeared in iphoto within a few seconds of being plugged in.  <answer247643> Open iPhoto, and then drag the SD card symbol that is on your desktop, into a folder in iPhoto (you can create a folder and name it whatever you want). Then iPhoto will import all the contents of that SD card!  <comment52282> Could you be more specific about how the card is connected and what the card is? <comment52283> Does the card contain a DCIM folder? <comment52284> Using iMac and card is inside the SD slot on the side. Yes, it contains a DCIM folder. I should also mention the same card used to work in iPhoto on the same computer and I have imported before.
