Yosemite updates and prompts <body> I am very new to using Macbook Pro, and was recommmend finding on the new Yosemite system that there are far too many prompts and synched uppdates etc. Does anyone know how I can do a general disabling of them? For example, I would like to remove the prompt like auto refill, when I am filling in forms for payments or I get email and facebook uppdates when I am in other apps.  <answer161522> Open System Preferences and choose Notifications. From there you can silence the ones you donâ€™t want.
