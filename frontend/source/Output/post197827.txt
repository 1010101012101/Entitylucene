iMac 21.5-inch Mid 2010 won't boot into OS X after installing Ubuntu, will boot into grub rescue <body> So, as the title says, I have an iMac 21.5-inch Mid 2010 model and I installed Windows 8.1 with Boot Camp. After attempting to uninstall Ubuntu and Windows in Disk Utility (in OS X and Recovery) it would always give me an error, "Partition failed with the error: The requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too small. Please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change."  strongWhat I have tried:/strong  ol liI have tried resetting PRAM/NVRAM with kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/Alt/kbd + kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd, nothing./li liI have tried holding kbdX/kbd to Start up from an OS X startup volume when the Mac would otherwise start up from a non-OS X startup volume.

I noticed that the keyboard wasn't initializing during boot so I picked up a new keyboard(something I didn't even think of at the time) and it initialized. I held the kbdOption/Alt/kbd key and to prevent this from happening again I installed rEFInd.  <comment236531> Also, I can't hear startup chimes, so I might not be able to clear the NVRAM/PRAM correctly. <comment236602> I have Ubuntu 14 installed along with OS X 10.10.4 and Windows 8.1 on my mid 2007 20 inch iMac. You have not yet asked a question. Do you have one? BTW, you probably erased both OS X and the Recovery partitions. Did your model come with an OS X installation DVD? In not, then did you create a Recovery Mode USB flash drive? You can try booting using Command-Option-R, but your model might be to old to do this.
