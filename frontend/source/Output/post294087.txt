ANSI Colours not showing in iTerm2 <body> I've tried following answers in this link but I still can't get the ANSI colours in custom themes to show for me in iTerm. Did anyone find any other fixes?  https://superuser.com/questions/399594/color-scheme-not-applied-in-iterm2  <comment371189> Did you try creating your own theme? Does it work there? <comment371590> Yep, I just tried that and no luck.
