Enable right click Magic Mouse in Terminal <body> I am trying to enable the right click on a Magic Mouse connected to an iMac running 10.6.8, but due to parental controls, I am unable to gain access to the Mouse System Preferences.  I know you can change other settings through Terminal, is it possible to change it to enable right click as well?  I saw this question, but the command    pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codedefaults write com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse MouseButtonMode TwoButton /code/pre  did not make it work for me. If I do  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codedefaults read com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse /code/pre  then is confirms that the TwoButton string was set, but when I right click, nothing happens.  <answer143223> Never mind - logging in and out made it work!  Such an obvious fix.
