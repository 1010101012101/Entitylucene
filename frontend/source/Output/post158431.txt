How to install Social Engineering Toolkit in mac <body> I want to install SET from this link: https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit. If I am right this is the github repository. I have brew installed can't I grab it with homebrew and then use all the tools like I do in Kali?   Or the other method downloading the zip file and compiling it....but I don't know either. Basically, teach me some way with which I can install and repository from github.  Thanks.  <answer219660> There are (at least) three ways to proceed:  ul lirun codebrew search &lt;packagename&gt;/code and, if successful, install via brew/li liwrite your own formula for brew/li liclone the repository with git and compile it yourself/li /ul  For details on all three methods, it's best to consult the corresponding documentation (and come back with specific questions if you are stuck).   PS: The tool mentioned in the question is actually written in Python, so compilation will not even be necessary.   <answer247388> You don't need to compile the SET afaik, the install is:  precode    git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit     cd social-engineer-toolkit     python setup.py /code/pre  now to start the setoolkit run  precode    ./setoolkit /code/pre  <comment186281> Note it says it supports Windows and Linux NOT OS X <comment186342> but what is the process if i want to install some supported repository ? <comment186351> That is too broad as it depends on how it is built - but the best way here is to write a home-brew receive if not already in homebrew
