On iOS 10, what is the half grey, half app screen about? <body> On the iPhone 7 Plus with iOS 10, at times, maybe some part of the screen is touched, the screen will turn into top half grey, and bottom half the app.  Then maybe the thinking is to touch the app to make the app back into full screen, but the way is exactly the opposite: you need to tap the grey part for the app to come back to full screen.  What is this and how does this work?
