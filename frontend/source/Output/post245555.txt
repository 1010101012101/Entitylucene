How to set default fonts in Mac? <body> Yesterday, I just installed Open Sans fonts family because I need it for developing apps in Xcode and to create some design in design software. Today, I see that almost all the text that should be using default fonts now using Open Sans Condensed instead, including some websites and some apps like Whatsapp chat bubbles. Open Sans Condensed is really bad for reading. How can I change the default font back to whatever the default system font was, but not turning off or deleting Open Sans font family because I need them?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/inIER.png" alt="App Example"  For example, the font displayed on Whatsapp chat bubbles should be like the "Type a message" font.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkX8M.png" alt="Website Example"  The default font on website is also affected.  <answer245560> Open Terminal and run these commands: (Restart after)  coderm -rf ~/Library/Caches/*  rm -rf ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State/*  sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/*  sudo rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/*  sudo rm -rf /var/folders/*  atsutil databases -removeUser  sudo atsutil databases -remove  sudo atsutil server -shutdown  sudo atsutil server -ping/code  Restart  strongReset Standard fonts in Font Book/strong  ul liOpen Font Book.
