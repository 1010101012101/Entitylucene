How to copy and paste styles with Keynote? <body> I am using codeKeynote'09/code and have to change a lot of text to specific styles. Since I can't define text styles I have to work around this missing function. Here is a simple example with a style I would have named strongImportant/strong if I could. But I can't.  To use this style on another location I use the codeCopy Style/code (kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd) and codePaste Style/code (kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdV/kbd) of the codeFormat/code menu.  Here is a starting document where codeword1/code is using the style strongImportant/strong: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P4wM7.png" alt="Before"  I select codeword1/code and copy its style (kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdC/kbd). Then I select codeword2/code and paste the style just copied (kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdV/kbd). codeword2/code is correctly modified, but the style of the whole line is also changed: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1e4Op.png" alt="After". The bullet was eaten!  Since this is something I would like to do about a hundred times on a normal presentation this is a real nightmare.  hr  My question is 3 (but they are highly related):  Did I made an error in my use of this function: copy &amp; paste style?  Is this a known bug?  Is this bug fixed in more recent versions of Keynote?  <answer268402> Yes its there Copy design  Command + Alt (Option) + C (Copy only Styles) Command + Alt (Option) + V   (Only paste styles)  Above works absolutely as format painter works in Windows Office.  <comment337157> I am not interested in Windows Office: this can't be considered as a model of quality software :(.
