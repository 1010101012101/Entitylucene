How can I get my Verizon apple Iphone to straightalk? <body> I have a Verizon iPhone and I want to hook it up with Straight Talk. Can anyone help me?  <answer97225> Your iphone has to be unlocked by Verizon.   Pending your contract they might or might no do that.  After that there is no problem using Straight talk.  <answer97239> I use my iPhone from Verizon (strongnot/strong unlocked by Verizon) in Thailand, where they don't provide any kind of Straight talk.br So I just disabled in Settings all sort of use of my [integrated] US number, and added my Apple ID. Thou it is now used more like iPod Touch, but I am pretty accessible true iMessage, FaceTime, Viber, Facebook, etc... And all this only when I am in a Wi-Fi reachable area.  hr  So IMO, to not use Verizon services with Verizon iPhone - this would be one option to do so...
