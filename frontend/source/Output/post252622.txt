Early 2015 15in Macbook Pro locks up after login? <body> Running El Capitan 10.11.6 Macbook Pro will boot to login screen. After password and about 60% into progress bar loading, it jumps to black screen. Computer will stay on, runs very hot, no cursor, trackpad non-responsive. Sometimes reboots to login screen but not always.  Reset PMC. Reset NVRAM. Won't boot into Safe mode. Won't boot to Recovery or Internet Recovery (will but locks up during loading). Will boot to target disk. Will boot to diagnostics (only one error     found because I've been ignorantly using gf's 60w charger after my     85w broke). Can login and use through thunderbolt connection as     external drive on GF's Macbook.  Playing Crusader Kings II when problem began. I don't think it ever went to sleep after I shut the lid. Was frozen and very hot when I returned from store.  Thanks for any advice you may have.
