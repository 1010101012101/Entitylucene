Macbook Pro (Early 2011) to 2560x1440 monitor? <body> I'm wondering whether I can connect my MBP to a 2560x1440 monitor and whether anyone else has has any success in doing so.  <answer141916> Maximum supported res for external monitor is 2560x1600 so I'd say if you used a Thunderbolt/miniDisplay Port - Display Port it ought to work. I wouldn't be so certain of DVI or indeed HDMI.
