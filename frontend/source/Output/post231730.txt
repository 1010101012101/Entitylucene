Error while unpartitioning hard drive? <body> I've tried to install Ubuntu (and gave up), but now there's a stuck partition, of 24.22 gigabytes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1n5I2.png" alt="partition"  The pink shows the partition.  I want to unpartition it, but when I try to delete it, an error shows.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T0DBB.png" alt="error"  Now, I have 24 unusable gigabytes. I've tried running First Aid on the master disk, but I still cannot reset the partition.  Is there a way to fix this?  strongEdit:/strong If I try it in recovery mode, it says "The target Core Volume is locked."

Then:  precodediskutil eraseVolume /dev/disk0s4 /code/pre  should remove the Ubuntu partition.  To merge the partitions, open Disk Utility from Recovery, select the ex-Ubuntu partition and click kbd-/kbd underneath the pie chart. This should remove the ex-Ubuntu partition and merge it with your Macintosh HD primary partition.  <comment283007> Thanks for the tip, but now the error comes up as "The target Core Volume is locked." How do I fix this? <comment283008> Ah, it's a core storage encrypted partition. By any chance are you using filevault? Additionally, it may help if you could post the results of `diskutil list` on your question. <comment283009> To unlock your volume, use `diskutil cs unlock LVG UUID` where the `LVG UUID` is the alphanumeric string underneath the target volume as reported by `diskutil list`. <comment283010> It doesn't seem to show on the list. There's /dev/disk0, the internal physical disk, and /dev/disk1, internal virtual disk. The locked partition doesn't seem to appear on the list. <comment283011> Please append the results of `diskutil list` to your question. <comment283022> @perhapsmaybeharry Removed the -1 but your solution is still no good idea. Erase volume doesn't remove the partiiton. It just removes a file system and adds a fresh one. <comment283023> Ah right yes, I'm getting forgetful... I haven't tinkered with DU for quite some time. I'll edit to include the partition merging.
