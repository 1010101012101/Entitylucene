Add text on line <body> I'm trying to add some text on a connection line. And when I move the connected shape, the text will move with the line.  How can I bind the text to the line?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B1xsS.jpg" width="300" / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7DaAW.jpg" width="300" /  <answer284522> This is currently not possible whilst keeping the connection line attached to the other shapes. To keep the text associated with the line, you can group them together, but then the connection line isn't fixed to the shapes any more.  It is possible to group the connected shapes, line and text all together, such that you can move the whole group as one, however this doesn't work for your example where you only move one of the shapes and want the text to move too.  You can provide feedback to Apple here:  ul lihttps://www.apple.com/feedback/keynote.html/li /ul  <comment358780> Have you tried selecting the objects and grouping them? (Hold shift while selecting the objects and then, once the ones you want to lock together are selected, press Option + Command + G) <comment358782> This works, but if I just group line and text, the line will lose its connection to   other two shapes. I need group all of them. <comment358783> Then use shift to select all of them and then group them <comment358784> So it's impossible to just group line and text and retain the connection to other shapes? <comment358806> Thanks, I'll submit a feedback about this.
