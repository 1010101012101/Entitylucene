Connection Timeout Error for WEP security <body> I'm connecting my MacBook Pro to a router which uses WEP security. It shows a emConnection Timeout/em error every half an hour. The security level of the router can't be changed, since its a common router. Other Mac systems are having no problems with it.  So far I've tried removing the network from the strongSystem Preferences/Network/strong panel and restarting the router and the computer, with no luck. What should I do next?   <answer56725> Different devices use different wireless chipsets. Although most should be compatible sometimes they don't work well together.  Did you try to update the router's firmware? A newer one might correct some glitches.  <comment65134> I didnt try so far..Is there any changes can be done in my macbook?.. <comment65138> I'm afraid no. If it always happens at about the same time it's most probably related to some wireless inconsistencies. <comment65141> ok..Thanks for your suggestions....
