Turn off auto-locking for specific applications <body> I'm just wondering if it is possible to disable auto-locking on my iPhone for specific applications? For example, I didn't want to lock screen of iPhone if LUMOback application is running in foreground.  <answer116080> This can't be done at the moment. The Auto-Lock setting applies to every app. The only exception to this is if an app asks iOS to prevent sleep.
