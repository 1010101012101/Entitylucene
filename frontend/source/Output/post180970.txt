Mac App Store updated an app, app doesn't know? <body> A few days ago, I have seen the newly released version of Xcode (6.3) in the updates section of the store, so today I decided to update it.  Updating from 6.2, the process started normally (Xcode was closed during this time) all the way until I could see on launch pad that the download and installation are completed. In the App Store updates section, I can see in recent updates - Xcode 6.3  However, opening Xcode shows me that I'm on version 6.2! As if the update never happened, which means I can't run my projects on iOS 8.3 devices...  Now I know I could uninstall and reinstall, but I'm trying to avoid this painful process..  Do you guys have any idea about what might be happening here?  I found a similar question, unanswered, from Oct' 14' here  <answer181156> Reinstalling is a very easy process on OS X Apps. Delete the .app from the Applications folder and download it again. Preferences and data are usually stored in the Library-Folder of your System or User and are therefor left untouched when deleting the .app file.  <comment215148> Reinstalling isn't exactly painful. Delete the .app from the Applications folder and download it again. All your preferences will be kept. <comment215387> I suggest you turn that into an answer so I can accept. Was quick and easy. Thanks.
