How to get back all the photos in the camera roll? <body> I connected my brother's iPhone4 to iTunes to sync movies in my library. Since, his phone has never done any backup and first time connect to iTunes, I'd mistakenly press on something writes "backup....", which I guess it referring my iPhone. And, unfortunately, all the photos in the camera roll were lost. Is there any possible way of getting back those photos in the camera roll that has never been backed up?  <comment123118> Did your brother have Photo Stream enabled? <comment123119> no, my brother never enabled the photo stream @patrix is there any possible way? <comment123167> If you clicked "back up" did it not back up to your computer? If not, were iCloud backups turned on? If he had never plugged it in to a computer before, it's likely that they were.
