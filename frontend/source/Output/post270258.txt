Can I show a gif animation in a Photos.app slideshow? <body> I'm creating a slideshow/movie in Photos, and some of my photos are actually animated gifs, but they appear as low quality stills in the slideshow.  Any way Photos can properly support these gifs?  <answer270267> Unfortunately the stock Photos app simply does not support the *.gif file type. To view *.gifs on a Mac you have 3 options:  ol liLocate the file in a Finder window, highlight it, and then press the spacebar/li liLocate the file in a Finder window, right-click, and choose to open in Safari/li liInstall a 3rd party application with *.gif support (such as 'PhotoScape X' or 'Fragment', both free in the App Store. Unfortunately neither of these have the ability to create slide-shows)/li /ol  I understand none of the above options help you with your slideshow project, and for that I apologize, but there is currently no way to make this happen.  With the addition of the Photos.app extensions (as of El Capitan) I was expecting someone to come out with an extension for *.gif support, but I have yet to find one or hear of one after searching tirelessly through the App Store and performing countless Google searches.  <comment339620> thanks, maybe when such extension pops up, someone will be kind enough to add a new answer to this question...
