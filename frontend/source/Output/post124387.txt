File tree list Mac Terminal <body> I am trying to create a .txt file that is the output of a certain function in the terminal.  So my function is to create a list of all the files that i have inside the folder TEST so what i typed was:  precodechmod +x /Users/XXXX/Downloads/Terminal.sh find /Users/XXXX/Downloads/Test -not -path '*/.*' &gt;/Users/XXXX/Downloads/TestFiles.txt` /code/pre  so this will create a file named TestFiles.txt, which will contain a list of all my folders and files inside the folder DOWNLOADS. its works perfectly fine for me  so my question isâ€¦. is there a way to add the size of each file right next to its name on the list in the .txt file?  Thank you  <answer124393> Try this:  precodefind ~/Downloads/Test -name '*' -exec ls -la -print &gt; ./files.txt {} \; /code/pre  code~//code is equal to: code/Users/XXXX/code  The file "files.txt" is saved in the directory that you run this command.
