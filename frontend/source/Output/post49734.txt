Firebug style inspect element on iPhone? <body> Is there anyway to do a Firebug style 'inspect element' on an iPhone?   My site works fine with Safari on my Mac but has a layout issue on iPhone.  <answer51236> They all say this is a remote debugger: http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/  From docs:     strongweinre/strong is a debugger for web pages, like FireBug (for FireFox) and Web Inspector (for WebKit-based browsers), except it's designed to work remotely, and in particular, to allow you debug web pages on a mobile device such as a phone.   EDIT: Here are more details and step-by-step instructions: http://envyandroid.com/archives/483/easily-debug-mobile-websites-with-weinre  <comment56938> Have you tried looking at the site using Safari on your Mac? <comment56939> Yes, updating my question.
