Drag a file from desktop into expanded Dock Folder stack? <body> I was cleaning up my desktop today and wanted to move a file from desktop to the a sub-folder of a Dock Folder, set to "Stack" mode.  I can drag the file onto the Dock, but it expands in a boring, not useful way alphabetically. If I click the stack to expand, it shows me a useful grid sorted by modification date, but when I click the desktop file, it closes.   I'd like to either get the expanded stack to stick open, or the drag operation to trigger the normal, useful stack expansion.  ProductName:    Mac OS Xbr ProductVersion: 10.12.3  BuildVersion:  16D32
