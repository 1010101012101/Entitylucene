Why does the iMac charge my iPhone faster than the wall charger? <body> I've noticed that my iMac at work (21.5", Mid 2011) charges my iPhone 5 about 2-3x faster than the included wall charger.  How does it do that?  <answer134955> If you have the USB 3 SuperSpeed (on your Mac) it can deliver up to 100 Watts.  For iPhone it will deliver 10 Watts (5 Volt x 2 Amps) which is more than your charger.  <comment159910> read the information on the charger! <comment159911> @Buscarì›ƒ I believe it delivers 5V at 1A. I haven't been able to find what the Mac does, so I'm asking here. <comment159914> 5V and 0.5 A or 1A USB, depends <comment159930> Thanks, I was trying not to ask a shopping question.
