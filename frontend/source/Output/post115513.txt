There's a "Change what happens when you close the laptop lid" setting in Windows. Is there an equivalent in OS X? <body> In Windows one can usually choose between  ul liDo nothing,/li liSleep,/li liHibernate./li /ul  The Macbook, however, doesn't seem to have this setting. It'll always go to sleep. I would like to set it to "Do nothing" to be able to finish downloads.  <answer115517> Nope, there's no such setting in OS X. This has lead to the creation of a number of sleep-prevention apps:  ul lih3InsomniaX/h3  Simple app but lets you set options for each:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LIIF.jpg" width="300"/li lih3macosx-nosleep-extension/h3  A preference pane for enabling/disabling sleep-prevention.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dfsLV.jpg" width="400"/li /ul
