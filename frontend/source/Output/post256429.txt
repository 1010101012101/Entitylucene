Let Finder display files with a user-defined extension <body> I have defined myself a file extension code.ev/code, they are actually text files, which can be opened by codeTextEdit/code.  In codeFinder/code, by codeColumn/code view, a code.txt/code document can be displayed directly on the right hand side. Does anyone know if it is possible to let Finder show code.ev/code as well, it will be more handy:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GUjAxm.png" alt="enter image description here"    <answer256441> Download the latest QLStephen.qlgenerator (direct download!) from the QuicklookStephen GitHub project. Unzip the file and move it either to /Library/Quicklook or ~/Library/Quicklook.  Now you should get a file preview either in Finder column view or by choosing the file and hitting the kbdspace/kbd bar.  <comment319846> Related: [Make OS X's Quick Look work for custom file extensions](http://superuser.com/questions/230204/make-os-xs-quick-look-work-for-custom-file-extensions) <comment319864> The link in the answer is a direct download.
