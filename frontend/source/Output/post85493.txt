How to change attributes of ALL master slides in a KEYNOTE theme at once? <body> Is there a way to change multiple masters at once in strongKeynote/strong.  Examples  ul liChange the background color for ALL slides from grey to green./li liChange all fonts from Copperplate to Garamond/li liInsert a company logo onto all slides simultaneously./li liChange the default background to all text boxes to #6699EE/li /ul  There is a similar question but the accepted answer explains how to do it for ONE master.  This question was asked once before, in November 2011.  Has this situation changed?  <answer214012> I don't think that it's possible. Each of the Keynote masters are pretty different items, with completely different fonts, objects, etc. It's a failing of the system.  <comment98560> I think it could be useful if youâ€™d *link to the question* you are refering to. This also helps users viewing the other question find your question (and potential answers). Thanks! <comment98612> Also, it might help if you tell us what application you're using (i.e. are you using PowerPoint or Keynote?)
