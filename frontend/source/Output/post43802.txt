Prevent disk image automount when clicking Finder sidebar <body> I have been playing around with the strongView/strong &rarr; strongView Options/strong in Finder and I must have touched something crtitcal because now whenever I click on a folder in Finder it automounts a disk image located on my external hard drive. The image is located in code/Volumes/elements/App/myapp.dmg/code.  If I unplug the external hard drive, everything is back to normal. But when the external  hard drive is connected, it happens again.   I could remove the file, but I want to find a better solution.  strongEdit/strong: It does not matter if I move the dmg to another location (i.e: I move it to code/Users/charasoverride/app.dmg/code), it gets automounted as well.  strongUpdate/strong: It does not happen for every folder but it does for sidebar items. (Favourites, Devices, etc.)  <answer43804> I would suggest trying two things. emAs a disclaimer, I have no idea what could be causing this because it makes no sense./em These are just some basic Finder troubleshooting steps:  h1Suggestion 1:/h1  ol liOpen Terminal from code/Applications/Utilities/code/li liRun the command codekillall Finder/code/li liLog out of your user account and log back in/li liTry again/li /ol  h1Suggestion 2:/h1  ol liOpen Finder/li liNavigate to code~/Library/Preferences/code/li liMove the files codecom.apple.finder.plist/code and codecom.apple.finder.plist.lockfile/code to the Desktop/li liLog out of your user account and log back in/li liTry again/li /ol  If neither of these suggestions work, I don't know what else you could try. Other StackExchangers?  <answer59553> This would be the semi-nuclear options but you could trash the entire contents of ~/Library/Preferences except for perhaps com.apple.mail.* (if you use Apple Mail.app) and com.apple.Safari.*  Also delete everything in ~/Library/Caches  The full Nuclear option would be to delete almost everything in ~/Library except ~/Library/Mail, ~/Library/Safari, ~/Library/Application Support.  And don't forget to restart after trying those troubleshooting steps.  <comment49773> Can you be more specific about what causes the issue you're describing? <comment49776> In finder, i click any folder then the dmg gets automounted, this only happens when my usb disk is connected because the offending dmg is located there, if i remove the usb it does not occur nor get any error. <comment49777> So, for example, if you have a `.dmg` file located in `/Volumes/elements/App` and you click on a folder in `~/Desktop`, the `.dmg` mounts itself? <comment49778> that's right, but it just happens for that specific dmg, not for all dmgs, i mean i can have more dmg in the folder and they wont get automounted <comment49779> Thanks for the suggestion but none of these worked. <comment49781> Update: It does not happens for every folder, only for the items in the sidebar (Favourites / Devices, etc..) it is really anoying because it takes a few seconds until it gets mounted not displaying the folder contents until the dmg is up. <comment49828> I couldn't help but notice that the path you outlined above (/Volumes/elements/App/myapp.dmg) included "elements." This external drive wouldn't happen to be a Western Digital brand drive, would it? <comment49926> that's right, it is a western-digital, but i do not think that has nothing to do, if i move the dmg to my hardrive it still happens.
