Safari: Cannot play flash videos on Steampowered.com due to "Blocked Plugin". Flash is up to date <body> For some reason, Safari is no longer able to play the Flash videos on store.steampowered.com. In place of the video is a simple message saying "Blocked Plugin". Clicking the message does nothing. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qduhK.png" alt="Blocked Plugin"  Flash seems to work fine on other sites, such as (for example) cbsnews.com.  Internet Plugins are turned on, enabled by default for all websites, and explicitly enabled for Steampowered.com.   When I go to System Preferences - Flash Player - Updates and check for updates, I am told that I am on the newest version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rqxCp.png" alt="Flash is up to date"  Quite frankly, I'd be perfectly happy to just turn off all of Safari's safety features that disable plugins under set circumstances. I generally keep software on my computer up to date anyway, and I need plugins, including Flash.  What do I need to do to make Flash work?
