Disabling password saving for certificates <body> I work in a HIPAA environment where we purposefully put passwords on our certificates. However, when connecting to one of our servers via SSH, it seems keychain is 'remembering' the password between restarts and hasn't been prompting me each time (as it needs to).  How can I disable this session-like behavior, so certificate passwords produce a prompt each time they are used?  <answer186145> sorry assuming using a mac. open favorite text editor, bbedit, textwrangler, vi, etc,..  precodecd ~ cd .ssh vi knownhosts /code/pre  locate the shared keybr delete all of them, if there are multiple.br save and ssh to server and they will negotiate again.  precode-x /code/pre  <answer186894> When the system prompts you to save your session in the following dialog:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tX4D6.png" alt="SSH Keychain"  Make sure that you do NOT check the codeRemember password in my keychain/code checkbox.  If you emdid/em check that, then you can always delete that saved password in the strongKeychain Access/strong app, located in your Utilities folder:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wfMP4.png" alt="Keychain Access"  Notice that even if you don't check the box, codeSSH/code does cache your password until a reboot.  Dave Dribin has an excellent breakdown of what's actually going on with OS X's codeSSH/code Keychain integration: http://www.dribin.org/dave/blog/archives/2007/11/28/ssh_agent_leopard/  strongSummary:/strong     The real benefit, though, is the second checkbox: “Remember password in my keychain.” While it does store the passphrase in your keychain, it actually does more than that. It also adds the identity to your ssh-agent for you.      By adding your identity to the agent, you can now log right back into the same machine, without typing any passphrase. However, ssh does not prompt for you passphrase because it gets it from the agent, not your keychain. Remove your identity from the agent, and try again:   precode% ssh-add -D All identities removed. /code/pre  hr  strongLocking your Keychain/strong  The other thing to consider is just locking your keychain after a reboot or sleeping.  This will essentially give you the behavior that you're looking for as well.  You can do this from the Keychain Access utility, by right-clicking on the keychain that your private key's password is saved in, and clicking on codeChange Settings for Keychain '&lt;YOUR_KEYCHAIN_NAME&gt;'/code  The following dialog will appear:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/t102j.png" alt="Keychain Access 2"  Just select the one that best fits your compliance requirements.  <comment219708> This doesn't make a difference. Known hosts are saved automatically when using SSH.
