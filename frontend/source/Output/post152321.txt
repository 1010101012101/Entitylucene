How to get Mail.app to display (rather than hide) duplicate messages <body> Prior to Yosemite, setting the following invisible preference would cause Mail.app to show duplicate messages rather than its default behavior of hiding them:  % codedefaults write com.apple.mail AlwaysShowDuplicates -bool true/code  This no longer seems to have any effect in Yosemite (OS X 10.10).  Does anyone know of an alternate method to achieve this?  <answer153139> precodedefaults write com.apple.mail _AlwaysShowDuplicates -bool true /code/pre  This should be working.  <comment179229> Out of curiosity, why would you want this? <comment179266> My company has a tight quota on email.  Having duplicate messages with large attachments without my knowledge is detrimental to my staying under that quota. <comment179267> Oh and BTW, there is a bug related to this: you cannot drag and drop any message that's hiding a duplicate into a new message as an attachment.  Having the mails displayed individually avoids this problem. <comment180561> I don't know who voted this down, but this does indeed work for me on Yosemite! <comment314547> It works on El Capitan too. <comment358077> It works on macOS Sierra (10.12) too.
