Can I output video to my TV using a MacBook Pro? <body> How can I do this? I have the 13" model.  <answer2320> As far as I know, youâ€™re only able to output HDMI (with audio) with any of the following models:  MacBook Pro (17-inch, Mid 2010), MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010), MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010), iMac (21.5-inch, Late 2009), iMac (27-inch, Late 2009), Mac mini (Mid 2010), MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2010).     iMac (Late 2009), MacBook Pro (Mid 2010), MacBook (Mid 2010), and Mac mini (Mid 2010) supply multichannel audio (up to 8 channels) and video signals over Mini DisplayPort. To connect your television or other HDMI devices to your Mac, use select third-party Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapters that conform to the VESA v1.1a DisplayPort Interoperability Guidelines.

The blog post emPlaying Hulu from my Mac to my TV/em might give you some ideas for other methods you could try.  <answer3309> Yes. You just need the right video and audio adapters.  Apple sells two adapters to connect your MacBook's Mini DisplayPort to DVI or VGA. Neither of those will include audio, so you'll also need to get audio cables. Your TV likely includes either optical or composite (RCA) jacks for one or more of your DVI or VGA connections.  For HDMI, you'll need a third-party adapter like this one. Note that this one does not carry audio either. The most recent 13" MBP does put audio out over that port, but I'm not aware of any adapters that can use the audio yet. That same site also sells third-party VGA and DVI adapters that are much cheaper than Apple's.  I can't vouch for the quality of the third-party adapters, but I buy most of my cables there, and I've always had good results.  <answer3323> I asked a similar answer on SuperUser (https://superuser.com/questions/126520/macbook-pro-with-dvi-to-hdmi-including-audio-possible).

It DOES output audio via the mini display port, so I bought this mini display port to HDMI adapter, which specifically supports audio. It works perfectly. The only "catch" is that you have to go into System Preferences - Sound, and select "output to HDMI" every time you connect.
