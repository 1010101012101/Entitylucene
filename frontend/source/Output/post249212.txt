How to get a list of URLs from an defined bookmark's folder in Safari <body> Have many bookmarks in the Safari's Favorites. Let say, have an folder called codeperl/code and it contains many links and also subforlders with links, like in the screenshot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5czKV.png" alt="enter image description here"  Need to extract all bookmarked links from the codeperl/code folder and it's subfolders strongusing ONLY Terminal's command line/strong. E.g. want run some command in the Terminal, like:  precodeget_my_bookmarks perl /code/pre  and the result will be a list of URLs.  It is possible to achieve this with applescrit, e.g. with  precode osascript -e '... some applescript voodoo ...' /code/pre  or by using some tool and extracting the wanted links info from the binary code~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist/code, e.g. the following  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c Print ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist /code/pre  dumps the whole plist (xml) - but how to easily extract only URLs from one defined bookmark-folder? Any idea for some simple way?  <answer249245> After some googling and learning XPath expressions, the solution is really simple:  The following shell script - let say its name is codedump_bookmarks.sh/code,  precode#!/bin/bash for foldername do     /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -x -c Print ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist | \     xmlstarlet sel --net -t -v "//key[.='Title']/following-sibling::string[.='$foldername']/parent::node()//key[.='URLString']/following-sibling::string[1]"     echo    #print an newline after the last entry done /code/pre  and using it as  precode./print_bookmarks.sh perl  #argument is the bookmark-folder name /code/pre  will print a list of bookmarked URLs, like for the above screenshot will print:  precodehttps://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny http://perlmaven.com/perl-based-open-source-products http://www.perl.com/pub/2012/04/perlunicook-standard-preamble.html https://acidcycles.wordpress.com/2010/11/24/implementing-factories-in-perl/ http://gcstar.softonic.com/ http://steffen-wendzel.blogspot.de/p/blog-page_24.html http://continuity.tlt42.org/ /code/pre  For the script you need install the codexmlstarlet/code command, for example using Macports  precodesudo port install xmlstarlet /code/pre
