How do I close all tabs on Safari for iPad after the app crashes <body> My wife went to a site that tries to load a PDF that crashes Safari for iPad.  After trying to load Safari again, it tries to open up all of the tabs again including the one that is crashing Safari.  While its loading the tab it locks everything up so I can't switch tabs.  How do I break this endless cycle?  How can I close this tab or have Safari not try to reopen this tab?  Is it possible to do this without losing the history?  <answer81825> ul liForce-quit Safari (double-tap the home button, then tap and hold on the Safari icon until it shakes, then tap the red minus sign). /li liGo to strongSettings/strong  strongSafari/strong.  /li liTap strongClear History/strong./li /ul  This should clear out all open tabs.  <answer81866> I struggled through this last night and stumbled upon a solution.  Go to Settings  Safari.  Turn on private browsing.  It will ask you if you want to close all tabs before turning on private browsing.  Touch 'yes'.  Next turn private browsing back off.  Voila!  The browser works again!  <answer280157> Safari stopped being stuck when I began to recharge my iPad. And there was no need to reset anything, or to wipe the History. No open tabs were lost either.   <comment94376> Thanks.  That's what I was afraid I would have to do, but I really didn't want to clear out the history.  Fortunately, I stumbled upon another way of doing this that lets me have my cake and eat it too. <comment94379> @JasonThompson There is no mention in your original question that you wanted to preserve your history. <comment94433> Thanks for mentioning that.  I wasn't sure if clearing the history was the only option so I didn't preemptively discount that option.  In any case, I updated my question so that others wanting to do the same without losing their history can find this question more easily.  Thanks for the feedback.
