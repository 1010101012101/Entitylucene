ssh Permission denied(publickey) <body> I have been trying access a server via ssh in terminal/ Everything works when I am working on Ubuntu.  I copied the ssh key to my Mac but it always tells me codePermission denied(public key)/code (see below).  When I'm able use secureCRT and CyberDuck, everything will work.  Once I use secureCRT to access the server, I'll be able to access it in the terminal.   Here is debug output from the connection attempt:  precodetracyliu:~ apple$ ssh -vT xxxx@xx.xx.xx.xx OpenSSH_5.6p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to xx.xx.xx.xx[xx.xx.xx.xx] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/apple/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/apple/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/apple/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/apple/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_4.3 debug1: match: OpenSSH_4.3 pat OpenSSH_4* debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.6 debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: server-&gt;client aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: kex: client-&gt;server aes128-ctr hmac-md5 none debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REQUEST(1024&lt;1024&lt;8192) sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_GROUP debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_INIT sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_DH_GEX_REPLY debug1: Host 'xx.xx.xx.xx' is known and matches the RSA host key. debug1: Found key in /Users/apple/.ssh/known_hosts:1 debug1: ssh_rsa_verify: signature correct debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: Roaming not allowed by server debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Trying private key: /Users/apple/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/apple/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: No more authentication methods to try.

In the process of doing that, I pulled a rookie mistake and tried a command I probably shouldn't have: chmod -v -R 600 ~/.ssh. After I did that I can no longer access my .ssh folder on my mac. I get the error permission denied. When I try this ls -l -a ~/.ssh I get this:  ls: .: Permission denied ls: ..: Permission denied ls: id_dsa: Permission denied ls: id_rsa: Permission denied ls: id_rsa.pub: Permission denied ls: known_hosts: Permission denied  Does anyone have any advice on how I can fix this folder and the keys inside it?  Thanks  <comment36126> Did you check the permissions of the `.ssh` folder on both sides? It should only be readable by the owner. Please describe your setup. It is difficult to help with just: was working, is not working anymore... <comment36127> I have made some edits, please check to make sure I haven't changed any of your meaning. Also, more detail would be great. <comment36128> You don't need a new key. You can have the same private key on multiple machines. <comment36129> Thenaks for the output. Could you also check (post) the permissions of your ${HOME}/.ssh folders and key on both machines? `ls -ld ${HOME}/.ssh; ls -l ${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa`: they should both be `rw-------` <comment36132> @Matteo I check the permissions of .ssh folder ,it is  rw------- and I also changed the .ssh/id_rsa to  rw-------  ,but it still doesnâ€˜t work , I have tried to del the folder and made a new , "The authenticity of host 'x.x.x.x' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/Users/apple/.ssh/known_hosts)." <comment36133> @KyleCronin thanks very much <comment36134> @wtracyliu The "Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts" is indeed a permission problem. Which user owns the directory and the file? With which user are you logged in? <comment36144> @Matteo drwx------  5 apple  staff  170 11 17 17:38 .ssh -rw-------  1 apple  staff  969 11 17 16:09 .ssh/Identity    i was logged in with user apple .. I was confused that why other application could work normally with the key <comment36147> .ssh/Identity is not the default name for the private key. You should either rename it to id_dsa or user `ssh -i .ssh/Identity` <comment36151> @Matteo That's it. maybe there are sth different between ubuntu and Mac, actually,I had rename the private key before, but it didn't work.  thanks very much for your help. <comment83058> Please put an answer in the answer section and select it.
