How to pair with a bluetooth headset? <body> I have a MacBook Pro and use an Apple Magic Mouse. I want to pair a wireless headset but have not been able, I cannot even see where to start.  <answer173675> Go to codeSystem Preferences &gt; Bluetooth/code and make sure bluetooth is on (select codeTurn Bluetooth On/code if it isn't). Also make sure your headset is turned on. Wait for your headset to appear on the list on the right, select it and click codePair/code.   The actual pairing process might differ depending on the headset, e.g. whether it requires a PIN code or not. The possible PIN required should be found from the headset's user guide.
