How to have Safari open links with the evil target attribute open in the same tab? <body> In some pages, there are (still) links marked codetarget="_blank"/code.  Safari opens such link in a new tab.  How to have Safari open such link in the same tab ?  I have Safari 7 on Mavericks. I have older Safari as well.  <answer113102> You can use a userscript such as the following:  precodevar a = document.getElementsByTagName('a'); for (i=0;i&lt;a.length;i++)     if (a[i].getAttribute('target')=='_blank')         a[i].setAttribute('target','_self'); /code/pre  Install  I recommend installing using NinjaKit for Safari, but other userscript extensions also work.  <answer113147> Install the Safari extension LinkThing to customize links behavior. It should be able to solve your problem, additionally, you can also customize the onsite and offsite links behavior.  <comment132736> Noo, don’t do that ! These curly quotes in my question are totally wrong ! This sort of “correction” smells of Microsoft Word. I have written correctly target="_blank". <comment132741> I have tried \``the backtick trick`\` — to no avail. <comment132742> What do you call a “userscript” ? Thank you, but this looks complicated. <comment132743> It's basically a JavaScript script that runs on pages specified in the `@include` line (`*` = all pages). You can install it using one of many 'Greasemonkey' extensions, and I recommend [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit). Simply download and install the [Safari extension](http://ss-o.net/safari/extension/NinjaKit.safariextz), then click the install link in my answer. The script I've written above will get all `a` links on the page, and if their attribute is `_blank` it will change it to `_self`. <comment132748> Thank you, but I don't want that. <comment132749> @Nicolas Why not? <comment132750> For several reasons. The main reason is : I don’t want a mill running in all the links of all the pages ! :-) <comment132752> Now I have edited the title, to circumvent the auto-“correction”. The site wrongly transforms target="_blank" into target=“_blank”, à la Microsoft. Incredible, but true. <comment132753> @Nicolas If it's only certain domains that you want the script to run on (like I did for my remote intranet), you can limit the script to only run on that domain by changing the `@include` line or lines to one or more domains. <comment135766> I have adopted the extension LinkThing ! A nice one, despite the weird way to go in its prefs. However, it does not work with JavaScript off, and it fails to work on some link(s).
