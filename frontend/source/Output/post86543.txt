Is there a way to edit google spreadsheets offline on iphone? <body> I downloaded their app but it doesn't let me edit them when offline. But some websites seem to say it's possible to edit them offline.  Any ideas?  <answer86544> Not currently, but I'd assume Google is working on that to eventually allow you to.     Offline editing isnâ€™t currently supported.   supsub(Source)/sub/sup
