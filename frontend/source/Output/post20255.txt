Will DVD Studio Pro work on an Intel Mac? <body> I am looking at using DVD Studio Pro on an Intel MBP.  1. Which version will work? 2. How much control do I have over the DVD?  This is kinda two questions, so if needed I can split it. Just let me know.  <answer20317> DVD Studio Pro 4.1 is the first Intel comparable version of the software. I believe that came with Final Cut Studio.   You have great control over DVD authoring. The best if not only solution on the Mac. Menus, scripting, tracks, etc.  <comment60352> I have 4.1 and it doesn't install on intel machines <comment60354> [DVD Studio Pro is certainly designed for both PPC and Intel processors](http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/DVD_Studio_Pro_4.1_lbn_z.pdf).
