Apple Mail name different in inbox and message <body> Anybody run into this before? My name is appearing differently in the Apple Mail inbox than in the message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/70xbD.png" alt="Tim Cleary in the inbox, Timmy Cleary in the message"  Ideally, I'd show up as Tim Cleary in the message. I've edited my iCloud contact record, removed and re-added my name from the Mail.app Previous Recipients list, and confirmed that gmail sends from "Tim Cleary", but the message won't update to the correct name. I'm thinking it might have something to do with linking my account with Facebook, because that's the only place I'm Timmy.  Any thoughts?
