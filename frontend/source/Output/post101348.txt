Is there an app which allows sharing of an iPad screen to another iPad? <body> Is there an app that lets me share one iPad screen to another iPad when both are in the same location?  <answer101349> You could potentially use something like Reflector to mirror one iPad to a computer and then use a VNC client on the other iPad to view the computer, but I've never heard of any iPad-iPad direct sharing.
