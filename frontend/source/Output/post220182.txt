Scale applications on El Capitan for retina <body> Now that "AppleDisplayScaleFactor" isn't available on newest versions of Mac OS X, is there any way we can scale applications?  I'm wondering because I have some non retina applications that if I could open them at 50% size it would not only make the app pixel perfect but I would gain a lot of screen estate.  I don't want to turn up my screen resolution though, most apps would be just to small to use and read.
