DNS Lookup Failure on Terminal Only (Mavericks) <body> I recently did a clean install of Mavericks, and ever since I have, I've been having intermittent DNS lookup failures on emthe terminal only/em.  Browsers work fine (Chrome, Safari).  But nothing works from the command line (codeping/code, codetracert/code, codecurl/code, codegit clone/code, etc.).  The problem will eventually just go away (sometimes 30 seconds, sometimes 10 minutes), and it does help to switch between the network and the guest network (running a 2 year-old Apple Airport Express), but the problem will eventually express on either connection.  It's maddening.  It seems bizarre that the problem is restricted to the terminal; it seems like network requests from the terminal would use the same mechanism as a browser.  ul liOSX 10.9.4/li liChrome 35/li liSafari 7.0.5/li ligit 1.8.5.2/li licurl 7.30.0 /li /ul  <comment164009> could you share your Terminal commands you use, and if you get error messages ? <comment164051> I can do that when I get home.  The commands are all very mundane: `git clone https://github.com/georgepaterson/jquery-videobackground.git`, `ping google.com`.  The error messages are all along the lines of "Unknown host: github.com" or "Couldn't reach google.com". <comment183862> I just upgraded to Mavericks and am having this same issue. It's true in other apps like iTerm as well so I assume it's an issue with some core service/library.
