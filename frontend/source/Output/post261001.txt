Spotlight fails to show word definition (dictionary.app) when a 3rd party input method is selected <body> I'm using Macbook pro MF840 with a OS X 10.12.   I installed a 3rd party input method to input Chinese, and when that input method is on, I can't quick-check a word definition in Spotlight. Instead, I need to switch to default input method and then type that word into Spotlight. Is there any workaround to fix this?   Thanks in advance!  Here is the screenshots showing the problem:  ol liwith default input method on img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7gtro.jpg" alt="with default input method on"/li liwith 3rd party input method on img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSpEA.jpg" alt="with 3rd party input method on"/li /ol
