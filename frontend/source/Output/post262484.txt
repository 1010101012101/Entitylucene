Is it possible to only sync favorite photos/videos to iCloud from my iPhone? <body> So, I've accumulated a lot of photos and videos on my iPhone and I'm happy to sync a few to iCloud, but I don't really want all of them there. Partially because there are lots of near-duplicates and also because I don't have enough space in iCloud.  Instead, I would like to ONLY sync favorites to iCloud and not bother with the non-favorites. Any ideas on how to do so?  iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1  <answer262516> Yes, it's possible using Apple's iCloud Drive. emWith iCloud Drive, you can safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, strongimages/strong and any other kind of document in iCloud â€” and access them from your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC./em  strongFollowing are the steps to upload your favourite pics on iCloud:/strong  strongStep 1:/strong Open your favourite photo from photos app which you would like to upload on iCloud.  strongStep 2:/strong After opening it, go to options  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nn8sM.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   strongStep 3:/strong Select strongAdd to iCloud Drive/strong option  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxZO7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  strongStep 4:/strong Select iCloud drive from the list.
