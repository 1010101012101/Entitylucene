Moving a window to another workspace by a key combination <body> Is there any way to move a window to another workspace by a key combination? For example, in Ubuntu I can do that by "Ctrl+Shift+-" if I recall correctly. In mac - only by mouse? It's not convenient.  <answer174213> From http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18757?viewlocale=en_US :     strongMove an app window from one space to another/strong      Place the pointer over the windowâ€™s title bar. Hold down the trackpad   or mouse button, then press the Control key and the Right or Left   arrow key.   <answer174223> You can use Better Touch Tool to move window to different space (even move to secondary monitor). However this does not work on fullscreen windows. Here's sample setting:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LX589.png" alt="enter image description here"
