How to make OS X not remember ssh key passphrase <body> I have a passphrase on my ssh id_rsa key, and OS X  asks me for the passphrase the emfirst/em time I want to use it, but even if I decline to add it to my keychain, it doesn't ask me for a passphrase again until I reboot.

Maybe theres a command i can type into the terminal to tell it to forget the passphrase? <comment297620> how do you " decline to add it to my keychain,"? What does `ssh-add -l` prints after the first use? And what about `echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK`? <comment317646> its still remembering the passphrase unfortunately, even after doing this. I'm on Sierra now but it was still happening even with El Capitan...
