Trackpad is selecting without clicking even though tap-to-click is disabled <body> In the past few weeks, my trackpad seems to be selecting on very light presses--light enough that I'm not pressing down hard enough to "click" the trackpad, but I am pressing down. I normally press down lightly as I move my cursor around the screen, and then press down more (so that it clicks) when I want to select. But now I've been unwillingly selecting many things.  I would wager that this is a hardware problem, but I've coincidentally only noticed this since upgrading my MacBook Air (2011) OS for the first time ever, from Mountain Lion - Sierra a few weeks ago. Any idea?  It's not as extreme as this question: Trackpad tap to click malfunction. It's not always "pressed down"--it's just selecting when I'm applying just below the threshold pressure to click the trackpad.  I'm using a MacBook Air (mid-2011) with macOS Sierra.
