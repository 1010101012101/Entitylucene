Mobile-Safari stopped asking me to update passwords <body> I use a wifi hotspot where, after I connect, I have to fill in my username and password in a loginscreen.  My username stays the same, but the password changes quite often.   Safari used to detect when I entered a different password, and offer me to update my saved password. Now not any more...  How do I enable this?  <answer219852> Go to Settings→Safari→'Passwords and AutoFill' and enable 'Name and Passwords'.  <comment266021> Already enabled. <comment266128> I tried removing the password in the hope it would ask me to save the password when I enter it. But it doesn't happen. "AutoFill" is enabled in the safari settings. <comment266760> On "normal" websites I don't seem to have this problem, but on the WIFI login page I do have this. Maybe that page has somehow disabled the possibility to store passwords recently? <comment266884> The only way I know how to do it is to directly modify the keychain database.
