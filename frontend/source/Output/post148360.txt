is it possible to open a file with commandline mate without focusing TextMate? <body> Or if not, is there an easy way to return focus to iTerm/Terminal after opening a file/directory with mate?  <answer148385> Preferences-Keyboard-Shortcuts will allow you to set a hot key to start terminal. You can then switch to terminal. The other way would be to write an applescript or a shell script to start textmate and then terminal.  <answer148570> an osascript works, although the amount of time from calling codemate/code until iTerm is refocused is somewhat annoying  precodefocus_iterm () {   osascript -e "tell application \"iTerm\" to activate" } mateb () {   mate $@   focus_iterm } /code/pre  <comment174976> I was specifically asking about the commandline program mate, a shell program textmate installs.
