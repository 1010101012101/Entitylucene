F3 on sierra opens the desktops panel in closed state, how to show open? <body> When you hit the F3 button on sierra it shows the desktops in a panel along the top ( mission control ).   The names of the desktops are shown: desktop2 desktop3 firefox desktop4  But it requires me to move the cursor to the top of the screen to see the what is on each of the desktops.  When the cursor is moved to the top of the screen the shrunken state of the desktops is expanded.  How can I have this as the default state when I hit F3.  I don't want to move the cursor to see whats on each of the desktops.  --edit-- Adding screenshots: SHRUNKEN state screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zHjU.png" alt="shrunken state screenshot"  EXPANDED state screenshot img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P2COY.png" alt="expaned state screenshot"  <comment330590> Found a solution: BetterTouchTool https://www.boastr.net/ allows for this functionality.
