Create a symbolic link for sublime text in Mac OS X <body> I have the newest Mac OS 10.12.3. With the new rootless system Apple has implemented, I can't create a symbolic link using codeln/code under code/usr/bin/code. My goal is so that I can use codesubl/code in terminal. How can I do this?  <answer270639> The default directory for third-party executables in macOS is /usr/local/bin. Since this directory already is in the PATH you don't have to modify anything except emsudo linking/em the executable to this dir.  If the directory doesn't exist, create it with codesudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/code. If you plan to install brew later, it's recommended to change the owner of the bin folder to your user.  <answer280743> Basically you symlink it. See this answer on github gist https://gist.github.com/artero/1236170  <comment340134> `/bin` does not exist under `/usr/local/` <comment340136> @B.Li Then create it with `sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin` <comment340144> I don't think that automatically creates the link though. Terminal still doesn't recognize the command. <comment353129> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment353130> The OP is not asking how to create a symlink per se, as using `ln` was already mentioned, but how to deal with SIP while creating a symlink at `/usr/bin`. klanomath's answer already covers making the symlink at `/usr/local/bin` as suggested in the link you posted. <comment353133> @B.Li, Saying "_Terminal still doesn't recognize the command._" without also providing the exact command you tried and the exact error message, leaves us without any information to diagnose your issue!
