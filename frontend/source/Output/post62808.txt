Why does Time Machine ask for a password but backs up anyhow? <body> I am using Time Machine with an external drive connected to a Macbook running Mountain Lion.  I use backup encryption.    Whenever I connect the external drive TM asks for my password.  The password I'm sure I used doesn't work, nor any others I've used in the past.  However, it still backs up when I choose 'Backup now' and I appear to be able to use Time Machine to view old files in other backups!  Any ideas what may be causing this?  <comment72474> This seems to be a mix-up with the Key Chain. As soon as I enabled adding it to keychain it accepted my password and stopped asking to re-enter it.  On removing the recently added item in the key chain it started asking again.  It seems Time Machine can get into a state where it both recognises you have a valid keychain, but also asks for a password. <comment72487> It's possible you had multiple conflicting keychain entries (e.g. one in your personal keychain and another in the system keychain), and *one* of them was the wrong password...
