Install El Capitan with VirtualBox on OS X <body> I am creating an El Capitan Virtual Box on my Mac. This is the process I take. I pressed some keys (it says any) as shown in second image, but I get nowhere. What should I do to move from here?  ol liI double click the "El Capitan" option   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/61CS3.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThis is the screen that opens next.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/05FQ7.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liThis is how I specified the elcap.dmg. This is the dmg file of  codeInstall OS X El Capitan.app/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NDfPA.png" alt="enter image description here"/li /ol  Nothing is happening. What am I doing wrong?  <answer233788> The dmg file (Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg) is no bootable image.  To create a bootable file use the following script. You may have to modify some paths (i.e. the user name in the last line and the path to Install OS X El Capitan.app (and the inner InstallESD.dmg file) in the 6th line):  precode#!/bin/bash    # Create bootable El Capitan ISO  # Mount the installer image   hdiutil attach "/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg" -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/esd  # Create empty cdr image   hdiutil create -o ElCapitan.cdr -size 8000m -layout SPUD -fs HFS+J  # Mount the cdr image   hdiutil attach ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/iso  # Restore Base System to the cdr image  asr restore -source /Volumes/esd/BaseSystem.dmg -target /Volumes/iso -noprompt -noverify -erase  # Remove Package link and replace with actual files   rm /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation/Packages  # Copy Base System   cp -rp /Volumes/esd/Packages /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/System/Installation cp -rp /Volumes/esd/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/ cp -rp /Volumes/esd/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System/  # Unmount the installer image   hdiutil detach /Volumes/esd  # Unmount the cdr image   hdiutil detach /Volumes/OS\ X\ Base\ System  # Convert the cdr to ISO/CD master  hdiutil convert ElCapitan.cdr.dmg -format UDTO -o ElCapitan.iso  # Rename the ISO and move it to the desktop   mv ElCapitan.iso.cdr /Users/user_name/Desktop/ElCapitan.iso /code/pre  Paste the content in a text editor to a new document as plain text and save it as prepare_elcapitan_cdr.sh on your desktop.  Open Terminal, chmod the script and execute it:  precodechmod +x ~/Desktop/prepare_elcapitan_cdr.sh cd ~/Desktop ./prepare_elcapitan_cdr.sh /code/pre  Detach elcap.dmg from the VM. Use the final ElCapitan.iso as installer iso and attach it to the virtual SATA Port 1. You can delete the ElCapitan.cdr.dmg file.  <comment285720> Great stuff! Thank you! Do you happen to know what is the appropriate storage space to reserve for this VB? According to https://support.apple.com/kb/SP728?locale=en_US it's 8.8GB. I reserved 30GB and I am still getting an error "There is not enough free space on OS X Base System to install" <comment285721> I opened a new question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/233823/not-enough-free-space-on-os-x-base-system-while-installing-el-capitan-with-virtu <comment313286> @sanjihan Thanks â€“ this question and your other question link above helped me with installing El Capitan in VirtualBox on OS X. Also, [this page](http://www.starkandwayne.com/blog/running-a-mac-vm-on-a-mac-using-virtualbox/) was of help with some problems along the way, including if conversion fails (force eject and run that `hdutil convert` line again) and black screen on boot (change the motherboard chipset to PIIX3 if you have increased RAM from 2 Gb). <comment313631> Don't thank me. @klanomath is the real MVP <comment324511> That first line in the script fails for me with Sierra. Error is: `hdiutil: attach failed - No such file or directory`. I know the path to the `InstallESD.dmg` is correct because I dragged-and-dropped from the Finder to the Terminal. What is `/Volumes/esd`? Should I have created a volume? My line: `hdiutil attach "/Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg" -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/esd` <comment324512> @BasilBourque In Sierra mounting volumes to /Volumes/ requires root permissions (in contrast to all older systems). You may create mountpoints in your user's realm (e.g. /Users/$USER/Volumes/mnt1) and use these instead
