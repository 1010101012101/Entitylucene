How can I disable media playback in Finder document icons? <body> I'm on Lion now, and hoped that Apple would have added the option to disable the quick preview buttons on the icons some way. Here's the problem I have:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rml4.png" alt="This is NOT what I want"  When I click on a video in Finder just to select it, I often hit the tiny triangle (see screenshot above), making the video play inside the icon. This is very irritating, since I have to click the teeny tiny triangle again to stop that.  Finder has a "Show Icon Previews" setting in the view options, but that does not do what I want, as it disables the whole thumbnail preview all together, like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kOX8O.png" alt="This is NOT what I want"  This clearly not very helpful. I'm looking for a way to keep the previews, but disable the controls on the icons, so that whatever I do, the icon looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/51pVh.png" alt="This is what I want"  I'd like to do this for emall/em file types with these silly tiny controls on a 32x32 icon.  <answer22446> Are you really seeing this on a 32x32 icon? This discussion suggests you won't see these controls for icons that are smaller than 64x64, which seems accurate (I just tried it).  However, my guess is that it will be impossible to disable this without disabling icon previews. Icon previews seem synonymous with Quick Look, so you either get Quick Look previews or you don't — and Quick Look icon previews come with those buttons.  <answer22473> A workaround would be to develop the habit of selecting icons by dragging a selection rectangle.  <answer25314> A workaround that can work in some cases is to Command-click or Shift-click the icon, which will not trigger the icon's play button. This works well if you have no other icons selected already, but if you have other icons selected, this will add to that selection instead of making a new selection like a normal, unmodified click would.  <answer282433> The Feature is controlled by QuickLook and therefore you need to either disable the corresponing movie-generator or replace it with a better one.  ul liOn 10.11 and higher: Disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)/li liGo To code/System/Library/QuickLook/code/li liCompress codeMovie.qlgenerator/code    ul liMove the created zip from your desktop to the folder/li liConfirm with password/li liDelete the codeMovie.qlgenerator/code/li liConfirm with password/li /ul/li liDownload qlMoviePreviewbr (Here is a Download Link for the Lazy)/li liExtract and Copy the codeqlMoviePreview.qlgenerator/code to code/System/Library/QuickLook/code  ul liConfirm with password/li /ul/li liOpen Terminal and type codeqlmanage -r; qlmanage -r cache/code/li liMaybe a reboot helps for Quicklook to change completely/li /ul  Now the Finder Movie Thumbnails show an image but have no longer a playback button in it.  <answer282450> Another idea could to be to change your Finder window view to List mode and increase the Icon size to maximum.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/26f3S.png" alt="Change OS X to list view"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f37RX.png" alt="increase icon size"  It’s not perfect, though. It will keep the preview and you won’t be able to play the video.   <comment25998> I already developed the tendency to click on the text below the icon instead of the icon itself. But I think that's silly, since the icon is designed to be an easy target. <comment355771> Just to add to this I understand for audio files but how is this useful for videos?  Beats me. <comment357301> Can I safely re-enable System Integrity Protection again after this change? <comment357330> Yes you can. The System Integrity Protection is only necessary to alter the files. In fact, the change can not be overwritten if you re-enable it.
