OS X Mountain Lion: Change resolution automatically when on battery <body> I have a rMBP running OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.  I normally use the display at a 1680x1050. Is there a way to have the display automatically change resolution to the default retina when on battery, and revert to 1680x1050 when power is reconnected?   <answer88722> Your best bet would be to use ControlPlane (free) to detect when the power source has switched, and then fire off a shell script to change the resolution.  There's no built-in command line utility for changing the screen resolution, but someone came up with one that works well. You can download an installer here.  Then it's just a simple matter of setting ControlPlane to run codescreenresolution set 1440x900/code or code1650x1050/code as appropriate. Note that you may want to experiment with the codescreenresolution get/code command first to double check how it handles retina resolutions.  <comment104001> ControlPane's 'about' page says it supports Snow Leopard through Lion. While I can check this out myself, but do you know if works well with Mountain Lion as well. <comment104002> okay, reading more through the app's website, and I see mountain lion mentioned in a couple of places. so ML seems supported (the developer probably forgot to update he about page).  the app looks really nifty, thanks for pointing it out!
