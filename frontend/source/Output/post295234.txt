can't install gtx 970 on Mac Pro 2008 (mac pro 3,1) <body> Been having an issue with video cards.  We started loosing video on our at 2400xt, an old stock amd/ati apple video card. We Bought a Zotac GTX 970. It worked for a while but one day would not give video. Despite using the latest drivers for Yosemite, and having nvda_drv=1 in nvram, the computer boots to a black screen. Popping the old Apple video card in allows for a successful boot.  I then tried an evga GTX 660, and got no video. I then tried an 8800 gtx, and the Mac gave one long beep, suggesting an EFI issue.  What could be causing this?  <comment372721> Was this all in the same PCI slot, or did you try moving them around? Did you give them all sufficient time to get to the desktop, because if they're not Mac flashed they will show no picture until boot is done. <comment372810> yes, main PCIE slot 1. I gave them quite a bit of time to boot up. However, my concern is the 8800 gtx, which gave a loud, long, single piercing beep. When i boot with the apple card in, which is an amd, i still see the nvidia driver as running from the top menu bar icon. <comment372812> I'd try another slot. Empirically, I've had GPUs running in slots 1 & 4 in that machine. I've never had any NVidia card though except its default 8800 that it came with - which was, of course, Mac flashed. Current is an HD 5700. <comment372816> my concern is slots 1 and 2 run at x16, while the others do not. <comment372820> tbh, I did all this before being aware of that fact - it never seemed to make any difference.
