Google Calendar will not sync with Calendar.app after Yosemite <body> I recently clean installed Yosemite on my 11" Macbook Air and my Google calendar will not sync with Calendar.app. Everything else on my Google account syncs with no problem, but the calendar refuses. I tried with another google account and had the same problem. Turned off 2-factor auth, same problem. Tried with CalDAV, doesn't work.  In Preferences  Internet Accounts  Google Account in Question, the box next to Calendars is unchecked by default. When checking it, I get a progress wheel that spins for a minute or so and then...nothing.  Is there something I'm missing here?  <answer157419> Mine works perfectly after removing/adding.  Have you removed, if you still have it there, the Google account and quit Calendar.app. Then restart Calendar.app, then go Calendar  Accounts and added it back?   <answer158288> Same happened for me on a macbook pro with Yosemite, and the problem fixed itself after a couple of hours.  I have multiple gmail accounts configured, and noticed that each account started to fail after I had accepted 'upgrade to the new google calendar app', so I believe this is a side effect of google rolling out a new version of calendar.  <answer202877> Go to account settings and check individually  calendars for them to update.  <answer227079> I got the same problem. For me it worked to delete the Google account in Internet Accounts altogether, then adding it back.  <answer250699> Have you tried changing what to be synced here? This is the Google Calendar Sync select page, it is also available for iPhone.  On these sites you are able to choose, which calendars are being synced. Your choices are:  ul liAll of your own calendars/li liAll the calendars you've subscribed to./li /ul  <comment185036> Have you tried unchecking Calendar from System Preferences  Internet Accounts  your gmail account and waiting 1 minute and then rechecking it? <comment185038> @ProfFrnswrth I edited the question to include that. Thanks for reminding me. <comment185067> Yes. I've done that multiple times <comment187544> The problem fixed itself, but I have since clean installed Mavericks and I'm experiencing the same problem. I suppose it will fix itself again eventually... <comment286871> Account settings does not show individual accounts. <comment286873> 10,000 views and only one upvote <comment301264> Yeah, that is because people are looking for a solution to the Google/OsX sync problem, and the solution that this thread provides is not effective, maybe because the specs are outdated. <comment311450> I'll hop back to 2014 and try that
