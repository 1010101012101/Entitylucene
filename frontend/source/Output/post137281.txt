Move data from 1 hard drive to the other <body> I have a bootable partition on an external drive with some old data that I want to move to a new external hard drive. The partition on the old drive is 500GB however theres only 320GB of data. So i want to keep the partition bootable and resize it so that I don't have 180GB wasted on my new hard drive. How can I do this with disk utility?  <answer137282> I think most disk imaging utilities will do what you are looking to achieve. Try Partition Magic or Macrium Reflect. In fact I know for sure that Partition Magic will automatically estimate the needed and resize the space as needed based on the original hard disk (and its partition) and the destination disk.  <comment163122> Are these software suggestions OS X software? <comment163128> Apple/Mac has something called Migration Assistant already installed in your Utility folder. <comment164044> Hi Dean, no. As far as I know they are PC tools. For Mac use the built-in Migration Assistant as suggested by Buscar above.
