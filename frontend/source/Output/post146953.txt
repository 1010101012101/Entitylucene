Finder quit unexpectedly <body> I've got an issue where Finder quits at startup and then every 2-5 seconds after.

It's evil on your machine.  Download the unofficial uninstalled here.  <answer146958> If you're running Docker, I saw a thread that implicates this with Finder crashes:  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1658289  <answer146992> To make sure the Google Chrome has not left a bitter taste in your VM (Virtual Memory).     While active memory contents are maintained in memory, the system also   keeps some recently used but inactive processes and data there in   order to quickly revive them, if needed.   The Terminal command would be:  precodesudo purge /code/pre  Be aware that purging can have side effects.  If above failed:  Run in Safe mode to verify if problem exists.  If problem continues use the Repair/Test your hardware.  Use Disk Utility repair.  Next run the Apple Hardware Test.  <answer150695> I was having this same problem recently on a mid-2010 MacBook Pro 15" (model 6,2).  I'm not entirely sure how I fixed it, but here was my process (forgive me for not having references to all the other threads I consulted readily available):  I installed and ran Onyx, which indicated that I needed to repair my drive, which I did by booting with the Option key held down.  (Something like that.  The point is you need to run Disk Utility without booting from that drive, and I believe doing this causes you to boot into the recovery partition or something like that, but I'm a little fuzzy on the details.)  I both repaired the drive itself and the permissions.  Later, I noticed that I had an unfinished update of Xcode 6.1, so I removed the half-downloaded new installation.  This briefly appeared to work, but soon Finder was back to spontaneously terminating every minute or so.  I found that booting into Safe Mode caused the problem to go away (verified by opening the Activity Monitor, clicking on Finder, and checking to see if it would spontaneously terminate).  Following @awesomebing1's advice, I ran the Google Update Uninstaller, rebooted into regular mode; no joy.  (I may have done one or two other things here, but I don't think they were critical.)  I ran the Apple Hardware Test to check that it wasn't an issue with my third-party RAM or something along those lines.  (If you're not especially experienced with using the terminal, obtaining and installing AHT may be nontrivial; also, halfway decent Google-fu may be required to actually find the code.dmg/code containing AHT.)  My computer passed.  I thought maybe my updating codebash/code to 4.3.27 could have had something to do with this, but Homebrew is (in my experience, at least) good about not breaking things.  Flummoxed, I thought I'd need to wipe the disk, clone an old backup, and then migrate the new data onto 10.9.4 (I'm not entirely sure that this would work well).  Before trying that, I thought I'd have nothing to lose by running the 10.9.5 combo updater and then trying to update Xcode again.  Since doing those two things, everything appears to be running fine -- my current Finder process has be up for over an hour without terminating.  tl;dr: Try the 10.9.5 combo updater.  <answer201229> I would recommend upgrading to Yosemite. It sounds like your Finder application is in a state that it doesn't run - it could be a broken update or malware. As others pointed out Chrome and Google Software Update are unlikely the cause. To the best of my knowledge, Chrome does not interact with Finder. Google Software Update does, but only during self-updates, which on a normally running machine are quite rare. I am familiar with the Google Software Update code - it doesn't do anything special, just uses the session of the Finder to make sure that its own agent is started on that session. This is performed by executing an Apple utility in that session, not Google Software Update's code in the Finder context. If you are curious, you can learn more about OS X agents here: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2083.  Additionally, most of the Google Software Update code is open source. You can get the idea of what it does here: https://code.google.com/p/update-engine/ It is unfortunate that I cannot give you a better advice, but upgrading the machine is probably the safest bet of restoring the machine/Finder state.  <answer280313> I had the same issue after upgrading to Sierra 10.12.4. I tried various suggestions including deleting Finder preferences and Sidebar preferences without success. However installing the 'Combo Update' for Sierra 10.12.4 from Terminal  using the instructions found at http://luo.ma/geek/terminal-combo worked for me. The only things I needed to change in the shell-script provided there were the Combo Update version link and also changed '-gt' to '-ge' so it would run when the version number was the same as that already installed.      <comment173199> Looks like Google software update bug. Could You try to disable it by followin this post: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/77249/macbook-pro-keeps-freezing-could-google-update-be-the-cause ? <comment173200> Thanks for your comment - I've repaired permissions and the disk already.  Will add that info to the question. <comment173202> Ok, I'm going to change my question. <comment173206> Have done this, and uninstalled chrome - issue still happening, will post new error <comment173207> Hm..these commands didn't work for me as I didn't have the plist entry there.  Have uninstalled chrome and google updater and still getting a finder crash - new error log posted. <comment173212> Unfortunately I don't have Docker - I do believe that this started happening after a software update, so I imagine the issue is with another piece of software which is not compatible - but I've no idea which bit of software that is!
