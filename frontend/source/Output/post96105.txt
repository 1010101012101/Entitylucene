With one purchase you can uptate all your macs that sare linked to your iTunes account/s you own.   How to upgrade to 10.8 on Apple.com.  <answer96109> If your macs are using the same iTunes account (i.e. same appstore) you can do multiple updates with one purchase.  <comment112853> They don't need to be under your iTunes accountâ€”you only need to "own or control" them.
