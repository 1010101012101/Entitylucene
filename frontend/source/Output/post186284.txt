Host OS VPN Enforcement, Virtual Machines allowed on local network <body> I'm trying to achieve the following goal on OS X 10.10, but I'm not sure what model or how I should go about achieving this. Caveat, this is actually quite a tricky goal, so think of it as a challenge. I'm fairly new to the tools in OS X.  ul liOS X has a configured VPN connection using the native client. I want all connection to be enforced down the VPN only, disabling any other network connection. I am doing this by applying Firewall rules that allow all traffic down utun0, and have a default deny with limited traffic allowed such as DNS, DHCP and an IP connection to the VPN Server./li liAt the same time, I have VirtualBox (soon to be VMware Fusion) on the local system. Unlike the base OS X system being forced to only communicate down a VPN, I would like to allow guest virtual machines not to have this enforcement. I want guest operating system to be able to go straight out to the local network.  The reason is for security in an enterprise deployment. We trust the host OS and give it access to our corporate resources. We want to allow developers admin access inside there own virtual machines where they are confined from the host./li /ul  Soâ€¦ This is an interesting challenge. How do I allow the VM guests, with out removing the restrictions on the host OS X? I feel the answer lies somewhere with using virtual interfaces. eg v1 and v2. Each of these interfaces then (bridge?) to the physical interfaces (or uton0) on the host. I then apply my lockdown rules in PF to V1 and V2 accordingly. The host then sets its default gateway to v1. I then set the VM to have a bridged interface to v2, bypassing the hosts routing for V1. I confess, I don't quite understand how routing is performed to utun0.  How would you achieve this architecturally? How do I actually achieve this goal in the OS X world?
