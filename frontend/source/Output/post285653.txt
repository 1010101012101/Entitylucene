Does Keynote have its own 3d engine? <body> I often use Keynote's 3D charts. I find the rendering quality, precision of perspectives and speed to be similar to the results one would get from an actual 3D engine.   strongemAre these graphics produced by a basic 3D engine within Keynote, or are these complex images produced by the CoreGraphics engine?/em/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rLJhu.gif" alt="enter image description here"
