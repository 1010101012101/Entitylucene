Checking if option is selected under System Preference on Mac <body> I have an issue with  AD binding on Mac. Computer shows its already bind to AD but won't allow domain logins. What I noticed is "Allow network users to log in at login windows" option is grayed out. I have a script which allows me to rejoin AD remotely which is fine but I would like to know if there is a command or script that can go this setting and see if "Allow network...." is available and checked through terminal.   It would be great if someone can help me out or point me in the right direction.  Thanks, Fahed
