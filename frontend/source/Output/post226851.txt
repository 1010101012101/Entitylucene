How to access/print the DNS/mDNS cache in OSX El Capitan? <body> I am trying to get a visual of the DNS cache (IMHO this should be extremely easy but somehow I cannot get it in El Capitan). I have tried things like:br codedscacheutil -cachedump/codebr which some reason returns (why?):br codeUnable to get details from the cache node/codebr Also tryingbr codesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/codebr indeed printed a lot arguably useful information in code/var/log/system.log/code but it does not seem to work as expected. More specifically, I searched in the log and made sure there is strongno entry/strong for emwww.my-website.com/em. Then I accessed emwww.my-website.com/em through my web browser, re-executed codesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder/code, searched again for emwww.my-website.com/em in the log and once again nothing popped up (the actual search was simply "my-website" to make sure nothing was ignored). An entry didn't appear even when I used the codedig/code command.  Any help why I do not see the change in the emmDNSResponder/em output or where I can access the "real" DNS cache?
