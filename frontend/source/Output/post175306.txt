7.0.4 iCloud password forgot <body> I have a phone that has a friends iCloud account on and they don't know the password for it. How do I get rid of the account.  <answer175309> Ask your friend to recover the password via https://iforgot.apple.com/ and then to follow the steps documented in What to do before selling or giving away your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.  <comment206675> possible duplicate of [How can I bypass Activation Lock?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114985/how-can-i-bypass-activation-lock) <comment206678> Doesn't look like a duplicate to me, the previous owner is known to the asker here (as compared to the linked question).
