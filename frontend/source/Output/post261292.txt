Synology DiskStation connection issues for a Mac mini using Mavericks <body> How can I connect to Synology DiskStation that is located on a wired network if my Mac mini runs on a wireless connection on a different router? I'm using Mavericks, on a 2009 Mac mini.  <comment327221> There seems to be some details missing here like how do you want to connect?  FTP?  AFP? SMB?  When you say it's on a "different router" is the router local is it in a remote location? <comment327230> What I meant to say was I am connected to a wireless connection on one router, and the Synology Diskstations are connected to the wired connection on a Netgear Switch which is then connected to a Netgear router, then the ADSL router which has all my wireless connections going to it. <comment327246> Does the diskstation appear in the finder sidebar? If not, have you tried using SMB? To use smb, you need to get the local IP address (10.0.1.... or 172.16.0... or 192.168.0... or similar). Then, in finder, press "Cmd" + "K". Then type in "smb://10.0.1.50" (or whatever your IP address is). <comment327262> Can you ping the router?
