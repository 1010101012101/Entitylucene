Sierra on Mid 2010 MacBook Pro going slow <body> I have Sierra on a Mid 2010 MacBook Pro. The computer takes long time to startup. Moreover, it is often very slow to execute simple commands, such as opening a textEdit file, opening a Finder window, etc. Below is a screenshot of 'htop' at startup. I don't understand all the processes that are running, so I can't identify the ones that are causing the slow running of Sierra. Can you guys tell ? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CpMuT.png" alt=""
