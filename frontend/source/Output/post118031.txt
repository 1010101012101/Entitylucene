Seeking shell-scripting resources for the visual learner <body> I'm trying to teach myself shell scripting. I understand things best when I see them in the context of a system, especially when I can visualize that system. I'm looking for a visual companion to Apple's documentation. Obviously I'm going to have to do a lot of reading to learn this stuff, and also lots of trial and error with the Terminal.
