How can I change Fn keys usage based on application? <body> I would like to know if there is any application that can enable you use use Fn keys differently based on the current application.  For example in terminal or you favourite IDE you want to use them as standard function keys but for other applications you want to keep the default Apple keys.  <answer28725> I don't know what keys you need, but for me the easiest solution was to use all of them as standard function keys amnd using bowtie with global shortcuts to keep F7-F12 as media keys, while having F1-F6 as standard function keys.  <answer29113> strongFunctionFlip/strong might be what you're looking for.     strongFunctionFlip/strong's purpose is simply to disable the special features — rewind, play, mute, etc. — on the function keys. For example, if you "flip" F7, F8, and F9, those keys — only those keys — will revert back to normal F keys. Press the fn key with the special key to get the special function back. That is, the "special" and "normal" functions are flipped.        To assign a custom shortcuts to your reclaimed keys, use a program like Quicksilver or Keyboard Maestro.   <answer61303> Palua will do exactlly what you need.     Introducing Palua, the easy way to quickly switch the mode of your Function Keys on any Mac keyboard!      You need to run a game, or start a graphic application, or work on a   project that need F1-F12 as function keys, just hit option+command+TAB   and the switch will happen.      Smart Mode: Key mode changes with the application that has the focus.   <answer249567> There is an app - FNable - that can help you (works with El Capitan as well).  It can switch Fn keys based on app or using a shortcut.  <answer276377> Fluor is a relative newcomer to this space that does exactly what you want:     Fluor is a tool that allows you to automatically change the behaviour of the keyboard's fn keys depending on the active application.   It is open source, works on macOs Sierra and is actively developed (as of March 2017).  <comment33461> I've edited your post with more information, @ron, but just pasting links is not how things work here. Please the the [faq] for more. <comment33481> @LoïcWolff No problem. <comment233323> The link to Palua doesn't work, go here https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palua/id431494195?mt=12 <comment262620> Unfortunately Palua doesn't work with el capitan. I ended up setting the default to function keys (with keyboard pref pane) as I generally use those and using Keyboard Maestro to remap some of them back to the special apple keys. <comment281301> As of today Palua has disappeared from the App Store and internet in general. <comment282871> I am not certain, but I think Palua used to work on El Capitan.  I tried running it from bash, /Applications/Palua.app/Contents/MacOS/Palua, but got this error. "2016-03-19 23:07:40.302 Palua[21714:183915] Palua must exit, the Mac Apple Store Receipt is invalid." <comment295629> @ksr013 I was very disappointed not being able to find Palua any more. I started to love this small app. Any idea where it could've gone? <comment347822> The new MacBook with TouchBar does exactly what you asked for (six years ago). <comment350867> Indeed, Fluor does exactly this. Really good. :) <comment365072> Also very easy to install and run: `brew cask install fluor`, then just run from the Applications menu. Once Palua stopped working I migrated to Fluor and am very happy with it
