VPN Tracker 6 won't work on Mac OS X Yosemite <body> Equinux VPN Tracker 6 won't start on Mac OS X Yosemite. When starting up, a message says     Unable to load kernel extension   And invites you to restart, but to no avail.

Any idea on how to get it to run?  <answer177098> As read here, Yosemite won't load kernel extensions that aren't signed by an authorized kext (kernel extension) developer (at this stage, the protectionism of Apple no longer astonishes me).

Your message "VPN Tracker 6 is out–of-date" with either emQuit/em or emUpgrade to version 8/em shows how much your company is run by dinosaurs still stuck in the 90s of Microsoft of sorts.  <comment209343> @Downvoter: care to comment? <comment209411> Just who in their good mind would want to down vote this question?
