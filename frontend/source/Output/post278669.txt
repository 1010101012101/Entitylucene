How does the BootCache.playlist work? <body> So I'm looking at the BootCache.playlist file on my MacBook:  precodesudo /usr/sbin/BootCacheControl -c -v -f /var/db/BootCache.playlist print | less /code/pre  And I can't make heads or tails of it, rest that it contains the Volume UUID of the partition containing the OS.  precodestatic struct BC_playlist_mount BC_mounts[] = {     {"AAAAAAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD-EEEEEEEEEE", 0xda3} }; static struct BC_playlist_entry BC_entries[] = {     {0xa3000, 0x1000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0xc5000, 0x1000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0xd5000, 0x1000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0xde000, 0x1000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     ... etc ...     {0x25cb286000, 0x14000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0x25cb2cc000, 0x9000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0x25cb399000, 0x8000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0x25cb3f0000, 0x41000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0},     {0x25cb43b000, 0x36000, 0x1, 0x0, 0x0} }; /code/pre  My current understanding of what happens is that the code/usr/sbin/BootCacheControl/code loads this list of: code{address, value, boolean?, boolean?, boolean?}/code reads them into some function, which tells it what to load and where to find it. I found this article from 2004 giving a cursory explanation of the process: http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/misc/optimizations/#ONE but I'm not quite satisfied. Primarily, because there also exists this handful of other playlist files in the code/var/db/BootCaches/code folder...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5l8Oe.jpg" alt="/var/db/BootCaches directory"  I'm assuming the Login.playlist items are generated when you shutdown with a program running, or choose to reopen it when you log back in (maybe?). I guess my questions are: What do the addresses and values mean? What does BootCache.kext do with these values? How can I determine if they're called, when they're called, and what happens when they're called?
