Making Terminal bash auto-complete stop at ambiguous character and display all possible options <body> The behavior I see happening is that when I type something partially and hit TAB, if there are multiple files/commands that match what I had typed in, only the first one is displayed. Further TAB hits result in other matches being shown. Instead, I want the auto-completion to fill till the first ambiguous character and then if I hit TAB again, display emall/em possible choices (as in say Ubuntu terminal). This is what I have in my .inputrc:  precodeset completion-ignore-case on set show-all-if-ambiguous on  TAB: menu-complete /code/pre  The show-all-if-ambiguous seems to be what I am looking for, but it doesn't seem to work for me.   I actually want the behavior that this member doesn't:  Skip first terminal beep and to display ambiguous filename expansions  I like hearing the first BEEP (or stop) and then typing in some more characters to fix the ambiguity.  <answer224102> Thanks to comment from mtklr. Many web pages that talk about Mac OS X Terminal auto-complete asks you to add the 3 lines I mention in my question. But if you want behavior as on say Ubuntu, syou need just the first 2 lines:  precodeset completion-ignore-case on set show-all-if-ambiguous on  /code/pre  strongDo not add TAB: menu-complete/strong /s  it should be available by default in Mac OS Terminal (I seem to have gotten confused trying to setup auto-complete for git). You don't need to tweak/create a .inputrc file for general bash auto-complete.  <comment271666> I think you need to disable menu complete.
