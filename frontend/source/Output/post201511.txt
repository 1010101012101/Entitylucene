How to change layout in OS X like shift=English, ctrl=Russian? <body> How to change layout in OS X like kbdShift/kbd=English, kbdCtrl/kbd=Russian?    Like in Punto Switcher in Windows or Xneur in Linux?  <answer201512> If you want to change the keyboard layout easily first of all go to  System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources  and select the layouts you want to use.  Then, at the bottom of the window, you must check the option "Show input menu in menu bar". Now a little flag with the layout-country will appear in the menu bar and you can easily switch layout from that.  See screenshots attached  As instead, if you're more comfortable with keyboard switch, select the layouts as I suggested before in Keyboard Preferences and then do emcmd+space/em: a little transparent window will appear at the center of the screen and by pressing (again) emspace/em you can move all the way up &amp; down, selecting the layout you prefer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BBJsL.png" alt="The menu bar icon" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qffVT.png" alt="The keyboard preferences"  <comment242937> Why don't you just use [Punto Switcher](https://punto.yandex.ru/download/?os=mac) for Mac OS X? <comment242941> This answer doesn't meet the question. Well, the question is difficult to read. xNeur and PuntoSwitcher are apps which automatically switch the keyboard layout depending on language specific character sequences. E.g if you enter Drswga with your english input source it will be automatically rewritten to Дружба (which means Družba = friendship). <comment242943> Please clarify in your question if you want the automatic layout switch feature or just want to quickly switch different keyboard layouts (which can be done with cmd-space)?
