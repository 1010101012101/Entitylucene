iPhone cannot connect to internet when connected to a non-internet enabled WiFi network <body> I am developing a peripheral that uses WiFi and Embedded browser, the peripheral looks like an access point to iPhone but it is not connected to internet. When I connect my phone to this peripheral via Wifi, I loose internet connection on the phone using 3G.   Is there a way to avoid this? I have control over the software of the peripheral so I can change the IP addresses, gateways etc.   <answer71102> No, you can't. If an iPhone is connected to a WiFi network it won't use 3G anymore, even if your WiFi is not connected to the Internet.   <answer71105> No, you need to disable the WiFi in order to use the 3G network.   <comment82560> Not only are both answers incorrect - the iOS maintains cellular and Wi-Fi connections as can be easily observed with a free app called netstat, this is basically a programming question and not a user level question. Try to get extra details on the programming of the peripheral and re-ask this on http://stackoverflow.com if you have more programming questions. We could also edit this to be about  how a user might use the peripheral if you add more details but the question is too unspecific to be answerable.
