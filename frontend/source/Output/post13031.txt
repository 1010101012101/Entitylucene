Simplenote or Evernote or something else? <body> What is the best way to keep my notes stored in the cloud? I want to access them fast and they should be editable on every device I use. (iPhone, iMac, Windows, etc.) What do you personally use? Simplenote or Evernote or is there another contender?   <answer13033> I personally prefer Simplenote because it's simpler, plain text and not that fancy. Well, it's just text snippets and notes for me.  Google gets you loads of comparisons:  ul liSimplenote and Evernote â€“ in a rather large nutshell /li liSimplenote vs Evernote /li liEvernote vs. Simplenote/li /ul  strongEDIT/strong  If you want to look into Simplenote check out Notational Velocity!  <answer13040> If you're already a dropbox user and are willing to limit the number of cloud services you use, store your notes in dropbox :br - Plaintext is a stylish text editor for iOS devices with dropbox synchrobr - Epistle is the equivalent for Android  <answer13075> I was an early adopter of Evernote and it is a great service, but I've been using SimpleNote + Notational Velocity for a while now and I couldn't be happier. I recommend this setup to everyone I know with a Mac + iPhone.
