Has Apple said anything about why they name its macOS versions but not its iOS, tvOS, or watchOS versions? <body> Internally, Apple had originally codenamed OS X 10.0 "Cheetah," 10.1 "Puma," and 10.2 "Jaguar." Eventually, they had the bright idea to turn that into a marketing ploy and decided to publicly name all of their OS X's, and thus the tradition continues into macOS.sup[Source]/sup  iOS was iPhone OS before 4.0, but it was never given a name like macOS was. Likewise, tvOS and watchOS were always just given a number. Have there ever been any official statements from Apple explaining why they did not name these versions?  <comment371878> Before anyone closes, based on [this somewhat similar question](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231880/why-does-apple-name-the-new-product-iphone-se-what-is-se), this isn't primarily opinion based as I'm asking specifically for "official statements from Apple."
