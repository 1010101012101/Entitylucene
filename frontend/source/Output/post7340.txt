How can I force iPhone to resync contacts from server? <body> I sync email, contacts and calendar to my company's Exchange server. This morning all of my contacts are gone from my iPhone (iPhone 4, iOS 4.2.1). Facts that further explain:  ul liMy contacts were good last night/li liI haven't synched to my computer, updated any apps or changed any settings since then/li liI'm getting email and my calendar entries are all good./li liI see all my contacts when I log into the web mail interface to the Exchange server/li /ul  Is there a way to tell the iPhone to wise up and realize that it has screwed up its contacts?  <answer7341> Maybe you've already tried this but I'll suggest it anyway.  h1Check Groups/h1  ol liOpen codeContacts/code/li liTap the arrow in the upper-left corner labelled codeGroups/code if it exists./li liEnsure you have selected the right group of contacts./li /ol  h1Try Re-Sync/h1  If you need to re-sync because the above did not work you could try this:   ol liOpen the codeSettings/code app/li liOpen the codeMail/code settings. (This is listed as codeMail, Contacts, Calendars/code on older iPhones.)/li liSelect the account causing problems. (Usually called codeExchange/code.)/li liTurn codeContacts/code off and tap codeDelete From My iPhone/code when prompted./li liTurn codeContacts/code back on and tap codeSync/code when prompted./li /ol  <answer288340> Above trick worked perfectly for my iPhone 5S. Thank you very much. After my new carrier asked me to reset ALL on my phone, I had lost everything, Google contacts, emails, etc.  If you need to re-sync because the above did not work you could try this:  Open the Settings app Open the Mail settings. (This is listed as Mail, Contacts, Calendars on older iPhones.) Select the account causing problems. (Usually called Exchange.) Turn Contacts off and tap Delete From My iPhone when prompted. Turn Contacts back on and tap Sync when prompted.
