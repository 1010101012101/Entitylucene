Password not accepted after migrating old Mac to Yosemite 10.10.2 <body> I have just migrated all my data from my old MacBook Pro (early 2011) to my new MacBook Pro using migration assistant with Thunderbolt connection. Before starting, I have created a user account on my new Mac, with the same name as the old Mac had, that this time opens with my Apple ID password.  When starting migration assistant, I had the question what to do with the two accounts and I chose to replace the new with the one from the old Mac. What happened instead was that now I have both (old and new) accounts with the same name plus one guest account, but any of the three does not accept any of my passwords (neither the one I used for my old Mac, neither my Apple ID password, neither anything else I tried).  I looked up forums, so I tried the common solution: reboot with kbdOpt/kbd+kbdR/kbd, start codeTerminal/code, coderesetpassword/code - and I could do it, but after I restarted and tried the password (I used the same as I used for my old mac) and it still doesn't work.  I hope somebody can help me, I would really like to migrate all my data and not start from scratch.  <comment204354> An update: I realized that the problem is that there is a keyboard layout issue when I have to enter my password (e.g. to type numbers I have to hold the shift). If I respect that I can log in with my newly set password. Once logged in no problem with the keyboard layout. A bit annoying, because after repeated restarts the keyboard layout remains the same strange when I have to add my password to log in. Any ideas? <comment204361> What language keyboards are they both and what input are they set to.
