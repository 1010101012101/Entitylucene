Is there a list of punctuation commands for iPad dictation? <body> I'm sure Apple has published something similar for Siri, but now that the iPad dictation is out, where can I find a list of commands for dictation? Can I do things like hit the enter key, or type symbols? I'm obviously able to enter periods and question mark's, but beyond that I'm not so sure. So, how can I type out the words question mark Without actually getting a question mark?  <answer44558> Siri dictation is never going to be 100% accurate and the easiest way to get the result you want may be to edit the text emby hand/em after you've dictated the body of the message.  Jim Rhoades provides a useful list of Siri dictation commands.
