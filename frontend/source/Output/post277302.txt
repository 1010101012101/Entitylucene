New Terminal At Folder service in El Capitan doesn't use my Terminal profile settings <body> I have my Terminal preferences set to use the "Pro" profile. When I launch a Terminal session from the dock, it uses the "Pro" profile (black background). However when I launch a Terminal session from "Services - New Terminal at Folder" in Finder, it uses the "Basic" profile (white background). How can I set it to always use the "Pro" profile?  <answer277304> After launching Terminal.app the active profile of the shell  window is determined by the settings chosen in: Preferences  General  On startup open...  The profile of the next Terminal window opened or the one launched by emServices - New Terminal at Folder/em uses a default profile which can be configured here: Preferences  Profiles  Text: choose a profile in the left pane and hit the default button at the bottom.
