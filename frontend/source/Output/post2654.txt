Is there a good, non-Google Reader RSS reader for iPhone/iPod? <body> I'm looking for an app to read RSS feeds on my iPod Touch. I saw Reeder, but it looks like it only interoperates with Google Reader, as far as I can tell -- you can't just add an arbitrary RSS feed. Is there a good RSS reader that works without Google Reader?  <answer2669> NetNewsWire is a good reader and syncing with Google Reader is optional.  <answer2670> NewsRack is pretty solid, with a simple clean interface, and the ability to add feeds directly int he app- no Google reader required.  I use Reeder now, which I think has a nicer, slicker interface, but Reeder requires Google sync - you can't add feeds directly in the app.   Before that, I was very happy with NewsRack.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oC5Yt.png" alt="alt text"  <comment2714> Does NewsRack allow offline reading?
