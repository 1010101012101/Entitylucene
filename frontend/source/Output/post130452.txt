Java 7 Update 55.pkg can't be installed because its digital signature is invalid <body> I'm trying to install Java in order to use the Safari plugin. The "missing plugin" functionality redirects me to the Java download page, where I downloaded a file named codejre-7u55-macosx-x64.dmg/code, which contains codeJava 7 Update 55.pkg/code.  Now, when I try to run the installer, I get the following error message:     strongJava 7 Update 55.pkg can't be installed because its digital signature is invalid./strongbr   The package may have been corrupted or tampered with. Get a new copy of the package and try again.   I'm not sure what to do here. I do need to install the plugin unfortunately. :-)  I'm running OS X 10.9.2 (up to date, as far as I can tell from the App Store) on a mid 2009 mbp, in case that makes any difference.  <comment152930> Download it again, I've had such thing an ISO was corrupt. After redownloading it worked. It might help you too.
