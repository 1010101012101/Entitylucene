How can I restart from an Apple script without warnings? <body> I wrote this Apple Script to bless my Windows partition and boot to Windows only once:  precodedo shell script "/usr/sbin/bless --device /dev/disk0s3 --setBoot --legacy --nextonly " with administrator privileges tell application "System Events"     restart end tell tell me to quit /code/pre  However, each time I use this script to get to Windows, and then come back to OS X, it gives me the dialog that says my computer restarted because of a problem.  What is the correct "clean" or "official" way to restart with an Apple Script so that I don't get these warnings?  <answer141482> Instead of telling System Events to restart, tell Finder.  precodetell application "Finder"     restart end tell /code/pre  <comment166736> Same result. :/ <comment166751> Telling Finder or System Events to restart is the canonical way to do a clean system restart via AppleScript. To convince yourself of this, try dropping your first line that's `bless`'ing your Windows boot partition. I suspect the unclean detection is coming from this line, not the restart. <comment166824> Ok, it turns out this had nothing to do with the script at all. It's just happening now regardless of the way I restart.
