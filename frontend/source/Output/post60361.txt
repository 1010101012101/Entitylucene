How to use pipeline in Terminal <body> I'm trying to convert a P12 file to a PEM file. When I execute the command, the terminal asks me for three things:  P12 passphrase (I type it in, hit enter)br PEM passphrase (type it in, hit enter)br PEM passphrase confirm (type it in, hit enter)  I know I can execute a sudo command all in one shot by using the following:  precodeecho sudopassword | sudo rm -rf /file.p12; /code/pre  How can I add all three values in one shot?  <answer60365> The canonical unix tool for this job is expect.  Here is a short tutorial that should get you going on scripting a series of passwords to be entered when the appropriate prompt is detected by the tool.  <comment69490> ... just don't lose the file.txt from the end of that command. <comment69491> @bmike Thanks for responding, but could you be more clear? Should I do something like `echo password | echo password | echo password | normal command`?
