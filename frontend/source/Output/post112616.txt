Copying Subscribed Calendar from iPhone to Mac <body> I have a subscribed calendar on my iPhone. If I look in the emSettings/em under emMail, Contacts, Calendars/em, under emSubscribed Calendars/em, I see the subscribed calendar.  If I go into the subscribed calendar on my iPhone I see:  precodeAccount (On) Server: mobile.server.com/ical.php?uniq_uuid User Name: Password:  Use SSL (On) Remove Alarms (Off) /code/pre  On my Mac, I go to the Calendar application, and select emCalendar-Add Account/em, and then select "Add CalDAV Account...". There are three modes, emAutomatic/em, emManual/em, and emAdvanced/em. In the emManual/em mode, I see:  precodeAccount Type: Manual User Name: Password: Server: /code/pre  If I go into "Advanced", I see:  precodeAccount Type: Advanced User Name: Password: Server Address: Server Path: Port:         Use SSL (checkbox) Use Kerberos v5 for authentication (checkbox) /code/pre  I have the information I need to enter from my iPhone, but I can't save it on my Mac unless there's a emUser Name/em, but there isn't one in the iPhone account information.  How can I enter this information from my iPhone to my Mac? My Mac is running Mavericks and the iPhone is running iOS 7.0.  <answer112618> Try entering just a space for your username.  <answer118652> If it really is a subscribed calendar (i.e. a URL to an .ics file) you should try the following:  In Calendar.app on your Mac, choose File  New Calendar Subscription and enter the URL from your iPhone.  <answer118668> You are confusing a calendar subscription with a calendar account.  What you think of as a "calendar subscription" is merely a publicly readable file in the iCalendar format published using the "ical://" URI. This is a read only list of calendar dates.  CalDAV or Calendar extension to WebDAV is a protocol to allow a calendar server and a client application to exchange calendar information (by coincidence in iCalendar format). It is the calendar equivalent of an email account.  So you are attempting to add your subscriptions in the wrong spot. As has already been said, in the Calendar application go to the File menu and select "New Calendar Subscription" then paste in the URL.  If you strongdo/strong have a CalDAV account you want to add to your Mac then go to System Preferences  Internet Accounts and on the right select "Add Other Account... and one of the choices is "Add a CalDAV Account" and once created here it is available for Calendar.  <comment132241> Tried that, but that doesn't work.
