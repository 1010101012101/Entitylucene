How can I set program associations in mac? <body> I know the way to change association per extension (get info = open with = change all) but is there a way like in Windows to change association of all video extensions to be opened by VLC like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/S93Wi.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer289130> You have to right-click on the file that you want to open, let's say it's and .avi, then go to info and then you should see a menu that says "open with" expand it and choose the software that you want to use to open that type of file format.   <answer289133> With on-board GUI tools this isn't possible. But you can download and install RCDefaultApp which is a PrefPane.  Open System Preferences  Default Apps. Choose the Apps tab, scroll down to VLC in the left panel and choose it. In the right panel scroll down to Extensions and hit the (cycle) button...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xZ3pK.png" alt="enter image description here"  This works for other apps too - VLC is just an example also used in the question!  <comment365205> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Just to clarify, are you asking specifically about doing this for VLC? Or, are you using VLC and the screenshot purely as examples? <comment366855> Thanks a lot. Very helpful
