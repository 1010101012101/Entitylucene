Processing of Port Wine Failed <body> I was in the process of installing Wine on terminal (via Macports), and encountered this hurdle while "computing dependencies":  "---  Verifying checksums for xorg-libpthread-stubs  Error: org.macports.checksum for port xorg-libpthread-stubs returned: libpthread-stubs-0.3.tar.bz2 does not exist in /opt/local/var/macports/distfiles/xorg-libpthread-stubs  Error: Failed to install xorg-libpthread-stubs Please see the log file for port xorg-libpthread-stubs for details:  /opt/local/var/macports/logs/_opt_local_var_macports_sources_rsync.macports.org_release_tarballs_ports_x11_xorg-libpthread-stubs/xorg-libpthread-stubs/main.log"  Not sure how to proceed from here. Am far from adept at this.  Thanks,  <answer173942> For Wine under OS X I use Wine_1.7.36.dmg from "Wine.app Downloads" on kronenberg.org and XQuartz and both install and work nicely without the need to use MacPorts.  <comment204721> Thank you. If I may ask I follow-up question: Would I have to download XQuartz stable or development? Does the PC software (in this case a game) still have to be installed via Terminal? <comment204725> As a general rule, I always download the stable versions of whatever I'm downloading.  As to installing WinApps, I usually just run the `setup.exe` (double-click it in Finder) and it loads both `XQuartz` and `Wine` automatically to then proceed with the install as if it were being done under Windows. <comment204728> I appreciate it.
