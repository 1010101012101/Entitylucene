iCal entries in Gmail <body> My iCal details are showing up in my wife's Gmail account! I shared my personal and work calendars with her, as a courtesy, but don't understand how they've wound-up subscribed into her Gmail. Not popular at present! Any advice welcome?  <comment51430> Is she synchronizing her calendar, contacts and notes with her Gmail account through an iDevice perhaps? It's an option in iTunes, happens every time you sync your iDevice.
