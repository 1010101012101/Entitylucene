Screen capture utility no longer saves to Desktop <body> In the last few weeks, screen capture stopped working on my MBP. Well, partially.  I can still capture to the clipboard with codecommand + control + shift + 4/code, but if I try to do a standard capture to a file, my Mac plays the screen capture sound but nothing gets saved on my Desktop.  I'm running OS X 10.9.2. The issue has survived a reboot.  Any suggestions?   <answer125048> Under system preferences, go to KeyboardShortcutsScreenshots.  Check your key configurations and restore default if you need to.  You can also try changing it and changing it back.  <answer125063> I've never heard of this kind of issue, but I did some searching and it seems that this should work:  ol liOpen terminal/li liCopy, paste, and enter this line:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/ /code/pre/li liCopy, paste, and enter this line:  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre/li /ol  (See OS X Daily source and Lifehacker source.)  <answer125069> It sounds like the file is may be getting saved elsewhere. It can be set with  codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop//code and you'll need to codekillall SystemUIServer/code or log out/in again for it to take effect. As an aside using codetype/code and codename/code instead of codelocation/code can set those as well. codedefaults read/code will tell you how things are set.   <answer125071> Are you running codeDropbox/code? It has a "feature" that grabs screenshots, copies them to a folder called "Screenshots" in your Dropbox folder and then puts a public URL for the file on your clipboard.  Look for "Screenshots" in your Dropbox folder.  <answer148450> Shift, Control, Command, 3 or 4. Copied a screen shot to your clip board. You now need to paste this screen shot somewhere to see it.  If you use: Shift, Command, 3 or 4. This will save a screen shot to your desktop.  This will answer your question. All the best.  <answer150599> Your Screenshot is getting saved to the clipboard instead of to a file. Are you using a third party mouse like a logitech mouse?  If so then go into the mouse settings and if you are using a shortcut, change the save setting to file instead of clipboard.  <answer156031> None of the answers above helped me, but I discovered the my case:  codeShift + Command + Control + 4/code saves the screenshot to the strongclipboard/strong.  codeShift + Command + 4/code saves the screenshot to a strongfile/strong on Desktop.  So if you're using the first short-cuts, you have to manually open a photo editing app and paste the image, but this can be done automatically with the second short-cut.  <answer157554> In the last few weeks, screen capture stopped working on my MBP  This happened to me.  Go to Dropbox, Settings, Preferences, Import and uncheck "Share screenshots using Drop Box.  Mine now save to my desktop.  <answer171526> The answer for this is here, but spread out over several answers so here's everything in one handy place.  Works for these options:  - Shift+Command+3 - creates a separate file for each active screen. Basically a file for every monitor attached to your system.  - Shift+Command+4 - Allows the selection of an area to capture to a file.  - Shift+Command+4 then press space - Allows the capture of an open application window.  Does not work for Control+Shift+Command+4(3) as these key combos put the screen shots into the clipboard.   Open terminal (or your favorite terminal emulation program) and follow the steps below:  precodemkdir ~/Desktop/Screenshots defaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Desktop/Screenshots killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  You can replace the location with something other than ~/Desktop/Screenshots if you prefer. The directory has to exist or you will get an error saying that you do not have permission to save files in the location where screen shots are stored.  <comment146354> Thanks, but they're all still set to the default. My Mac actually makes the screenshot sound, but it doesn't save the file. Updating my question to clarify that... <comment146357> Do command-shift-3 to save to a file then do a spotlight search for all files named spotlight.  The file save location could have been changed some how.  You can use something like Onyx to change it back. <comment146364> what is standard capture to a file ? <comment146367> If it makes a noise it took a pic, but the question is where did it save, do a search for "screen"? in finder all my files <comment146378> This was it. Thanks! <comment247723> This worked for me. Thank you! <comment304000> For me it was solved by relaunching the Finder (option + right click on finder icon in dock and than Relaunch) <comment327125> `The domain/default pair of (com.apple.screencapture, location) does not exist`
