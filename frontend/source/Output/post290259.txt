Syncing videos from the Photos app on my Mac to my iPhone isn't working <body> I organize all of my photos and videos in the Photos app on my Mac (i.e. everything is in the codePhotos Library.photoslibrary/code folder). I also have iCloud Photo Library, My Photo Stream and iCloud Photo Sharing disabled.  However, when I try to sync photos and videos from my Mac to my iPhone via iTunes,  with the option "copy photos from Photos", my videos are not being synced across. iTunes is correctly counting the number of items in my Mac's Photos app (number of photos + number of videos). However, when it tries to sync the videos, iTunes displays "syncing 140 videos" and then just skips over all of them, while all the photos are synced correctly.  Does anyone know how to solve this?  <comment366443> Hi Bla≈æ, welcome to Ask Different. :) Can I ask that you please [edit](https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/290259/edit) your question to include the versions of macOS, iOS, iTunes and Photos you're using? Also, when you say _iTunes displays "syncing 140 videos" and then just skips over all of them_, what do you mean by skips? Is it skipping them in the sense it displays the message and then in a few moments it skips to the next process, or do you mean it's spending time doing the syncing of videos but that afterwards you just can't find them on your iPhone?
