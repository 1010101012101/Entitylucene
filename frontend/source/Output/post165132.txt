Problem persistently defining aliases in terminal <body> I am trying to persistently define some aliases for my everyday terminal use. I started off with this tutorial: How to persistently define aliases in Terminal, more precisely with Mike's comment.  As he suggested I created a code.bashrc/code file and symlinked code.bash_profile/code and code.profile/code to it.  My two aliases I created in code.bashrc/code are the following:  codealias showFiles= ‘defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder’  alias hideFiles= ‘defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder’/code  Now I have a problem, when i open a new bash window in Terminal, i get this error message:  precode-bash: alias: ‘defaults: not found -bash: alias: write: not found -bash: alias: com.apple.finder: not found -bash: alias: AppleShowAllFiles: not found -bash: alias: TRUE: not found No matching processes belonging to you were found -bash: alias: ‘defaults: not found -bash: alias: write: not found -bash: alias: com.apple.finder: not found -bash: alias: AppleShowAllFiles: not found -bash: alias: FALSE: not found No matching processes belonging to you were found /code/pre  Could someone please explain why I get this error and/or how to fix it ?  <answer165134> The alias command requires you to have no spaces around the = and also you should use " or ' to enclose the string not urge curly quote ‘ you have. That quote often appears in pdfs and books when the editing program tries to make things look nice.  so the command should be   precodealias showFiles="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE; killall Finder" alias hideFiles="defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE; killall Finder" /code/pre  I can't find a reference for these but they are just things I have learnt :(  <comment193687> @CedricRBR's single quotes should be double quotes, as Mark indicates, but they should not be 'curly' quotes, either. <comment193690> @IconDaemon single quotes ' work as well here <comment193691> Agreed, but the examples in the original post are curly, and may be the cause of the problem if present in the .bashrc file, which expects plain text. <comment193702> `'`, `"` are valid in these alias definitions. `´` is invalid, in the sense it is not a metacharacter but a basic one. `bash` will read `´defaults` as a word, the name of a potential command and this "command" is not found. Which it tells to tell the truth :). <comment193717> reference: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-alias
