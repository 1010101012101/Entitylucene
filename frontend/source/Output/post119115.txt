Bluetooth keyboard is losing connectivity <body> Can anyone advise me how to make my pairing with the Apple Bluetooth keyboard permanent? Thing is that after shutting down or reboot it is lost and I must re-pair again. At the same time Magic Pad is perfectly "remembered".  These two threads are relatively old and I am not sure if they still apply:  1) Mouse/Keyboard won&#39;t connect after being powered off  2) Apple Wireless Keyboard not connecting automatically on wake  <comment138914> Have you already tried the solutions documented in the answers to the questions you linked? <comment139028> Yes. Problem reappears.
