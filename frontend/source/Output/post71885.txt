Keyboard shortcut to change the behavior of function keys? <body> Is there a shortcut for toggling the behavior of the function keys between standard and the media functions printed on them?  I know I can do this in the Preferences, but it would be great to achieve this quickly from the keyboard.  <answer120739> You can use Palua. It not only lets you customize the keyboard shortcut, but also lets you choose which applications use which behavior. Best $0.99 I've ever spent.  <answer120840> You can use a private.xml like this with KeyRemap4MacBook:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__DoublePressModifier__ KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::VK_CONFIG_TOGGLE_flipfkeys&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;flipfkeys&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier vk_config="true"&gt;flipfkeys&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN, KeyCode::F1&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP, KeyCode::F2&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL, KeyCode::F3&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, KeyCode::F4&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW, KeyCode::F5&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH, KeyCode::F6&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV, KeyCode::F7&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY, KeyCode::F8&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT, KeyCode::F9&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_MUTE, KeyCode::F10&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN, KeyCode::F11&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP, KeyCode::F12&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F1, KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F2, KeyCode::BRIGHTNESS_UP&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F3, KeyCode::EXPOSE_ALL&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F4, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F5, ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_LOW&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F6, ConsumerKeyCode::KEYBOARDLIGHT_HIGH&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F7, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PREV&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F8, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_PLAY&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F9, ConsumerKeyCode::MUSIC_NEXT&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F10, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_MUTE&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F11, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_DOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToConsumer__ KeyCode::F12, ConsumerKeyCode::VOLUME_UP&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  It makes pressing fn twice toggle between using the F-keys as normal function keys.  <comment89395> I want to know this too.. The fn key is just too far away for those F8-F12 keys. Maybe not keyboard shortcuts, but something easier than fn+F12 <comment134329> I also want to do this
