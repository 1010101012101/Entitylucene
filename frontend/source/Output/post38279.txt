How do I move a file into a folder in the iOS version of DropBox? <body> I uploaded a file from my email to DropBox on my iPad. Then I got several more files of the same type and realized that it would be appropriate to keep all of them in a folder.  I created the folder and was able to put the new files into it, but I see no option to move existing files into existing folders.   ul liHold-and-drag doesn't seem to work./li liThe 'edit' menu doesn't seem to work./li /ul  strongIs it possible to move an existing file into an existing folder in DropBox on the iPad? And if so, how?/strong  <answer38289> I believe it is just a shortcoming of the app. I usually just go online to complete this.  <answer38290> Steve  There is no method on either iPad or iPhone to move an item between folders.  <comment43372> Darn.
