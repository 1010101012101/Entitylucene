Late 2010 macbook air, can't install os again <body> I had wiped my 2010 macbook air and had tried to reinstall the os in recovery mode but the message "this item is temporarily unavailable" keeps popping up as I try to install os lion. Can anyone help me out ??  <answer277557> That's a weird issue, your best bet is probably to download the "OS X Recovery Disk Assistant" to reinstall OS Lion.   From Apple's website:     "To create an external OS X Recovery, download the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant application. Insert an external drive, launch the OS X  Recovery Disk Assistant,  select the drive where you would like to install, and follow the on screen instructions.      When the OS X Recovery Disk Assistant completes, the new partition will not be visible in the Finder or Disk Utility. To access OS X Recovery, reboot the computer while holding the Option key. Select Recovery HD from the Startup Manager. "   strongNote:/strong In order to create an external OS X  Recovery using the OS X Recovery Assistant, your Mac must have an existing Recovery HD, which in your case it most likely already does.
