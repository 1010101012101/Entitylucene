Option-delete not working in powerpoint <body> I'm using microsoft office 2011 and for some reason option-delete doesn't seem to have the standard behavior it usually does. It works fine in word and excel, however.  I don't have another computer to test with — can someone who has powerpoint 2011 see whether option-delete works fine for them too (I want to know whether this is an issue on my end or just microsoft's poor coding).  <answer284552> Your question is a little vague because you don't clarify what you deem to be the standard behaviour of using kbdoption/kbdkbddelete/kbd.  However, upon my own testing on an iMac with Office 2011, I can confirm that kbdoption/kbdkbddelete/kbd within MS Word does in fact behave differently than it does in MS PowerPoint. However, I found that it behaves the same way in both Powerpoint and Excel.  More specifically, in MS Word using kbdoption/kbdkbddelete/kbd will delete the entire word behind the cursor in MS Word, while in Powerpoint and Excel it only deletes a single character, just like it would by pressing the kbddelete/kbd key on its own.  <comment358865> Standard behavior of option delete would be the way it works in cocoa based apps: that is, it deletes the word. It seems that powerpoint overrides this default behavior, however. Thank you for confirming. I guess now I have to write an applescript or something to replicate that behavior.
