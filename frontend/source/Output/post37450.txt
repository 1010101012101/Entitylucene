How do I hide Quicktime Player's controls when the video is paused? <body> I'm trying to take a screen shot (using Grab) of a quicktime video that is paused.  The problem is that the video controls don't disappear, and thus are shown in the resulting shot as seen below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gIEyW.png" alt="screen capture with controls still shown"  Is there anyway to hide this UI when paused, much like it hides when the movie is playing?  Edit:  To clarify, I'm using Quicktime 10.0 on 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)  <answer37452> You can take a screenshot without the controls:  ol liMove your mouse cursor out of the quicktime window. (The media controls disappear.)/li liPress kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd4/kbd then kbdspace/kbd/li liMove your mouse cursor back into the quicktime window. (The media controls stay hidden)/li liClick your mouse to take a picture./li /ol  More tips on how to take screenshots in MacOSX can be found here.  <answer37469> In case no solution for Quicktime is found, here is a solution for movie snapshots using the VLC Media Player.  In the preferences disable codeAdd controls to the video window/code and click codeSave/code. Now you can take a snapshot as explained in my other answer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jMG7k.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer59393> I had a problem with Quicktime Player hiding the controls without returning them at all during playback.  On my own I discovered it was due to Quicktime's settings left over from an upgrade.  This is what I did to reset Quicktime Player's Settings to factory defaults:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX /code/pre  This helped me, and I hope it helps someone else.  <comment42483> Thanks for the response.  However, when the video is paused, the controls don't disappear for me. <comment42497> @mb That's strange. They should disappear immediately when you move your mouse outside of the video. Are you working on 10.7.2 or Snow Leopard? <comment42515> I'm using quicktime 10.0 on 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard). <comment42516> Ok, I'm using Quicktime 10.1 on 10.7.2. <comment42517> Try [MPEG Streamclip](http://www.squared5.com/) instead for your screenshots. That's what I use. <comment42527> Ah, ok that works.  Thanks! <comment64033> VLC also has an action for saving an image of the current frame (Video  Snapshot, assigned to ⌥⌘S by default). <comment64905> @mb I was wanting to do the same thing without success but think I've found a solution. It seems that the control panel comes up by default but once you're at the part you want to take a snapshot of and you've paused the movie, click in the actual Quicktime window and the panel should disappear. If you're scrubbing through the movie using a mouse and you get to the part you want, again, click in the Quicktime window and the control panel disappears. You can then use the shortcut outlined by gentmatt to select only the Quicktime window and you should have what you're looking for.
