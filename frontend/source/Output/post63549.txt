How to troubleshoot NIS binding problems on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion? <body> I am trying to setup NIS on OS X 10.8 but it fails for some reasons.  I tried to add the NIS domain using the Directory Utility.app but when I go to Directory Editor tab and select my NIS node, I do get an error:  codeConnection failed to node '/NIS/uk.example.com' (2100)/code  strongOn OS X 10.8 machine/strong  ul licodeuk.example.com/code is the domainname (does emnot/em solve in DNS)/li licodenis2.uk.example.com/code is the ypbind server (does solve in DNS)/li liI am already on corporate LAN and I can ping nis2.uk.example.com/li licodedomainname/code returns uk.example.com/li licodeypbind -d/code prints 'ypbind: returned from 10.80.16.129 about uk.example.com' but it does not return, I need to press Ctrl-C./li /ul  codepre dhcp-3-130:~ sorins$ rpcinfo -p    program vers proto   port     100000    2   udp    111  portmapper     100000    3   udp    111  portmapper     100000    4   udp    111  portmapper     100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper     100000    3   tcp    111  portmapper     100000    4   tcp    111  portmapper     100007    2   udp    845  ypbind     100007    2   tcp   1009  ypbind  dhcp-3-130:~ sorins$ sudo automount -vc automount: /net updated automount: /home updated automount: /Network/Servers updated automount: no unmounts  ypwhich nis2.uk.example.com /pre/code  ** On a reference Ubuntu, in the same LAN, where NIS works **  precodeypbind -d 31213: parsing config file 31213: Trying entry: domain uk.example.com server 10.80.16.129 31213: parsed domain 'uk.example.com' server '10.80.16.129' 31213: add_server() domain: uk.example.com, host: 10.80.16.129, slot: 0 31213: [Welcome to ypbind-mt, version 1.20.1] /code/pre  So Ubuntu works, but on OS X it doesn't. strongWhy?/strong  <answer63566> Since NIS is a third party product - you should be able to follow any of the great troubleshooting guides on the internet and make headway to determine if this is a client or server issue.  My gold standard for a NIS guide is from IBM:  ul liTroubleshooting NIS-Related Problems/li /ul  From what you have posted in the question edits - it appears that codeypwhich/code would be the next item to check to ensure the client OS is configured properly. If not, the network troubleshooting or a manual codeypset/code may be needed. If to, you could use codeypcat/code to see that the command line can call some of the maps you care to configure on the client side (hosts for example).  <comment73485> If you use `ypset` and `ypbind` from the command line, it will often give you a more actionable message than trying to figure out the GUI from the console logs. Can we presume you've made sure the host is reachable over the ports NIS uses? <comment73486> @bmike it gives me only what I already pasted and this is happening only if I call it with `-d` parameter. BTW, The Mac is already configured to be part of an Active Directory, but this should not interfere with this. <comment73493> Hmm - you wouldn't think that an AD binding would change the error message or take precedent when trying to establish a NIS binding. Hope someone has more of an idea? <comment73495> I removed the AD completely from the setup, just to be sure. Still I do get the same behaviour. <comment86813> What version/edition of ypserver are you connecting to? I hit this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=781880
