Some keys are not working on new Macbook with touch bar <body> Few keys like i, k and l are not working for my stronglogin/strong. These keys work at login screen and for strongother users/strong. Had a conversation with Apple support online chat and we went thru the following but issue is not resolved yet.  We did the following  ul liNVRAM Reset/li liSystem Management Controller (SMC) reset/li limacOS Recovery/li liUpdated latest OS :macOS Sierra 10.12.5/li liReinstall macOS using macOS Utilities/li /ul  During the process, app representative asked me to create new login and try and it worked.  Wondering if you have seen this issue on your Macbooks. I have so much data in my login and I haven't thought about it moving data to new login.  Thanks  <answer284196> Go to system preferences/accessibility/mouse &amp; trackpad and uncheck the box for Enable Mouse Keys.  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25642  <answer284198> I had to bring in a new 2016 Macbook Pro (no touchbar) after a few weeks due to keys not working, sticking, etc. This is a known issue. Apple Store gave me a new unit after they had to send mine out and it was over 5 days and still no idea when it was coming back.  https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/21/2016-macbook-pro-keyboard-issues/  <answer284455> Genius bar person took only a minute to figure this out. It turned out be Mouse Keys. I am surprised that the person I chat for couple of hours didn't know this.  Somehow, Option key was pressed five times and it turned on the Mouse keys.  http://www.macworld.com/article/1157890/computers/mousefreemac.html  Thank you all for your help.  <comment358345> On the chat you were on, has your case been pushed to Apple Engineers? <comment358349> I did not get any response from Apple rep at the end. We were working on this for more than 2 hours and when we started last step (Reinstall macOS) and it took more than 20 minutes and it was past mid night and I closed the chat as I did  not get any response. <comment358353> Try contacting again (using the case number you were given) and ask if they will push it up to the engineering team. <comment358377> But surely such a problem would not go away in another account, like he says his does. <comment358379> True...that part makes no sense (to me). <comment358382> `yes. I have. Apple person helped me with this. <comment358384> yes. It doesn't make any sense. But it's happening. <comment358385> I've a Genius Bar reservation at local store tomorrow. Will update the thread after my visit. <comment358386> @RedFox what other keys besides ikl do not work? <comment358394> I know you have a Genius Bar appointment tomorrow, but one thing you haven't tried, is booting into Safe Mode. This would be a good troubleshooting step to do before your appointment. To do this, Boot your MBP up in Safe Mode and try using the media controls keys. To do this, hold the shift key down as you boot up. This will take a little longer to boot as your Mac cleans caches, runs some diagnostics, etc. Once you've tested the keyboard, exit Safe Mode by restarting your Mac and then test the keys again. Even if this doesn't fix things, it's valuable info for us (or the Genius Bar!). <comment358724> We did try safe mode. <comment358725> We just had to disable mouse keys. Thank you. <comment358735> It only took me a minute as well, and I posted the answer here two days ago. <comment358742> Yes. I overlooked your answer. :-( At that time I didn't know about mouse key
