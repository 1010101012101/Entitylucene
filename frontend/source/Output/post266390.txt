changed from iphone 5S to a 6S - old icloud that is no good keeps popping up on my new iphone <body> On my new iphone6 my old icloud email still shows which is no good and I deleted that email and do not have a password for it, so how do I get my new icloud to show as the primary on my new iphone6 and get the old one off? Thanks
