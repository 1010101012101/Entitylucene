Change terminal color for each tab <body> I work on a lot of tabs in terminal at a given time. Sometimes, I get tabs mixed up and accidently run commands on tabs I am not supposed to.   To simplify this, I wish to write some script, that on each new tab creation, comes with a random background color (not the text background, the window background), so that I can easily identify the tabs I was working with.  Any suggestions ?   <answer219601> I would highly recommend using iTerm2 I'm still finding cool new features. I don't know about a truly random background color, but I know you can change your settings based on user, host, file system location. Though, that feature may still be in beta.   Yes, that's still in beta:     Automatic Profile Switching   Using the Shell Integration feature, you can have iTerm2 switch profiles depending on what you're doing. For example, you can define a profile that's always used when you ssh to some hostname. Or when your username is root. Or even when you're in a particular directory.   <answer219808> The built-in default "Solid Colors" profile randomly selects a background color for each new terminal.  It works by setting the background image to a folder of images, each of which is a solid color. To choose different colors (or patterns, etc.) you can place a collection of images in a folder and set a profile to use the folder in     strongPreferences  Profiles  [profile]  Text  Background  Image:/strong   Another feature of profiles is that if you create a new terminal with strongShell  New Command/strong or strongNew Remote Connection/strong it will look for a profile with a matching name and select that profile. It will look for a match of the entire command string, a partial match of the command name and arguments starting from the left, and it will also try to interpret the profile name as a regular expression.  This means you can name a profile “ssh” to have it selected for any codessh/code command, or “ssh emhostname/em” for ssh commands whose first argument matches emhostname/em, for example.  <comment265875> That's a pretty sweet hack, great find! The way it's worded in there, it's not very intuitive that an entire directory can be selected, let alone that it will randomly grab from there. <comment265877> @dennis.hempler The built-in “Solid Colors” profile exists to demonstrate this capability. In general, the built-in default profiles each attempt to demonstrate various appearance features, like translucency, blur, etc. I recommend trying each of them out. <comment267512> I've been using ***iTerm2*** for a while now but I haven't found anything new, helpful, interesting, special, exciting, etc. What's so good about it? Genuinely curious. <comment268331> Why are you using it if you don't find it special or helpful for that matter? In the unlikely event you're not trolling, Triggers is the original reason I changed to it. <comment268357> Ugh. No; I'm not "trolling." I resent the implication. You said, ***"I would highly recommend using iTerm2 I'm still finding cool new features."*** You're advocating it. I'm using it. I haven't discovered any "cool new features" yet. You have. I thought, perhaps, you wouldn't mind sharing that information..
