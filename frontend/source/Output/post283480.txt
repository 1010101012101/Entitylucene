iPhone 6, water damage black screen. <body> I dropped my iPhone 6 in the bathtub a few days ago, the very top of it where the front facing camera is located had already been chipped away before being dropped and my screen was cracked. I immediately grabbed it out of the water, took apart the case and dried it off. When I tried to turn it on I only saw a couple blue lines, it switched on and off showing the apple logo and then going back to line mess and then back to off. I tried to plug it in, click all the buttons. It was responsive, but again lines everywhere. Then I dried it out with a hair dryer, it worked. The screen went back to normal, the audio was working. I was pretty pleased. That following night I was watching a video on Youtube, left it playing. In the morning when I tried to turn it on, nothing showed up. Just a black screen. When I plugged it in it made a buzzing sound, but when I would hold down the power button it wouldn't show a dead sign, just nothing. I left it on my air vent, thinking when I returned from school it would be dried out and working again. Well, when I came home, it was still black screen and nothing displaying. And when I went to plug it in there was no sound at all, I held down the power button clicked the home button, didn't show me a dead sign. Just nothing. I took apart the phone, dried it off with a hairdryer (each time I used a hairdryer I used the cold setting btw, because I know heat is not good for an iPhone) unscrewed this metal plate, detached and reattached these three black strip things (I saw it on a video for water damage). Still nothing. It's been sitting still for a couple of days, haven't touched it. Is there any solution to this at all without having to get it fixed? Thankyou.
