moving from machd to mac os lion 10.75 <body> how do i update my macbook air Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5  to a more up to date version as I need to install remote access. When I try currently it says Microsoft Remote Desktop can’t be installed on “Macintosh HD” because Mac OS X version 10.9 or later is required.  please help  <answer237833> Go to the Mac App Store, then click on the updates tab and download &amp; install the latest update  <comment291543> The earliest Airs can't use anything newer than 10.7.5 <comment291551> @Tetsujin well he never says anything about which version he has, and I was only trying to add basic help. If the OP could provide us with more info, that'd be helpful. <comment291552> then really it ought to be a comment until a full answer can be established. Request further info to formulate an answer that will survive the test of time & google.
