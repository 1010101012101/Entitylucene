Power Mac G4 asking for terminal login <body> I was turning on my Power Mac G4, and it displayed the Apple logo, as usual, and then I was stuck on a blue screen for ten minutes, and then I'm on a black screen with white text, kinda like terminal. Before I tell you what it said, Fox McCloud is my account name.  It says:   "Darwin/BSD (fox-mcclouds-power-Mac-g4-agp-g) (console)  Login:"  I typed in my login and password, but when I typed my password, no characters came up. Terminal deemed my login incorrect. What do I do?  <comment367457> Did you land in Open Firmware? [I know almost nothing about it, merely that it exists] http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx/arch_boot.html <comment367458> characters for password won't show up. did you try again?  maybe you misspelled your password? <comment367466> Nope. I spelled it correctly. I tried resetting it and it takes back to terminal login.
