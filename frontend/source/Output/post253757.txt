Can't enable iCloud Desktop Documents Sync in Sierra <body> Every time I try to enable iCloud Desktop and Documents Sync it spins the spinner for a while and it looks like the setting is enabled, but as soon as I reopen settings it is deselected.  Console produces errors like these:  precodebird [ERROR] can't open Documents or Desktop &lt;private&gt;; error 2 (&lt;private&gt;) bird [ERROR] Failed to apply sync policy: -1 for folder type: 2, error: &lt;private&gt; accountsd [ERROR] iCloud Desktop Settings change failed: &lt;private&gt;, resetting to old value /code/pre  Any suggestions?  <comment315811> Could it be something wrong with your account? Maybe your iCloud account is causing the issue. <comment315830> Everythin else seem to be working. I have payed and enough free space in the cloud. <comment323196> I had the same issue but the 10.12.1 update (today) fixed it.
