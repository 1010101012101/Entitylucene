How can I create an installer for individual files? <body> I would like to create an installer (.app, .pkg?) for a selection of data files.   I need to place them in code~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CameraRaw/code  I've been playing around with WhiteBox Packages and I'm able to successfully create a .pkg that will install a file to the desktop, but for some reason it will not place the same file in the Library directory I specified above. The installer runs without error, but it does not copy the payload into the CameraRaw directory.  What am I doing wrong? Why does it successfully copy a file to the desktop but not to the CameraRaw directory?  <answer271928> In my case, this was it:  The installer was working as it should, but it was placing my files into   precodeMacintosh HD/Library/Application Support/... /code/pre  instead of   precodeMacintosh HD/users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/... /code/pre  now I just need to modify the destination to point to the correct folder.
