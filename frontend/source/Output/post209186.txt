Macbook Pro SD card reader is not listed as USB hardware <body> I have 15' early 2011 Macbook Pro with Mavericks installed. Everything works fine, except SD card reader. Even it's not listed in USB hardware list.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJU5m.png" alt="enter image description here"  Tried find a solution by searching the internet without success.  SD card slot is dust-free and pins are clean. PRAM/SMC reset doesn't help either.  strongHow to fix it?/strong  <answer209187> As far as I know it's strongnot/strong supposed to be listed under the USB devices at least in Yosemite and El Capitan, not really sure about Mavericks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xaMXA.png" alt="As you can see it has it&#39;s own tab"  <comment252297> Ugh. Really?   Should not it look like this: http://kb.parallels.com/en/114560 <comment252610> I found this line : "Parallels Desktop supports USB connected SD card readers. In order to find if you have Card Reader connected via USB, please follow these steps...". It felt as though they were talking about an external reader. Did you check your Card Reader tab? Does it work under OS X? <comment322584> Sorry, I have forgotten to answer you. Recently I have updated the OS to El Capitan. And now it looks exactly the same as yours. But problem remains, SD cards are still not recognised.
