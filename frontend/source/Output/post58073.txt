Mountain Lion upgrade and many sites are not opening <body> I've upgraded to Mountain Lion and since then many sites including Google (and all of its related services), facebook and many other sites are not opening. i can't even open gmail.com. the name resolutions seem to be working fine.      dig gmail.com      ; &lt;&lt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt; gmail.com ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got   answer: ;; -HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 24840 ;;   flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0      ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;gmail.com.

But all these sites open from my wife's macbook (snow leopard) that is using same internet connection.   however, i can open many sites including all SE sites, github and many others.   is there anything i can do? as i can't google, i'm literally can't search web too :(.   thanks in advance.  <answer69523> This issue affected several people after upgrading to Mountain Lion. For many, reducing their MTU size solved the issue:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongNetwork/strong./li liSelect your connection and choose strongAdvanced.../strong/li liSelect strongHardware/strong./li liChange strongConfiguration/strong to strongManually/strong/li liReduce the MTU size to 1300. Most people had good experiences with this value./li liObserve how codeping/code behaves over time. You can further reduce the MTU size in steps of 4./li /ol  However, there seems to be another issue: Proxies. The solution suggested here is:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongNetwork/strong./li liSelect your connection and choose strongAdvanced.../strong/li liSelect strongProxies/strong./li liTurn off strongAuto Discovery Proxies/strong./li listrongApply/strong the settings./li /ol  This should be fixed with an upgrade to OS X 10.8.1 (not sure if an upgrade to Mountain Lion directly brings you to the latest upgrade, or to 10.8.0).  Actually, I would first try the upgrade to 10.8.1. If this does not work, try the proxy solution. If this does not work, try the MTU size reduction.  <comment66822> i've just entered into the Recovery mode and i see i can access those pages. But the problem persists in the normal macosx startup! <comment66842> how are you connected to the internet? <comment66861> WiMAX. but when i connect via WiFi it same result. <comment67092> I have same problem. I'm using Timecapsule and connected via WLAN. <comment67095> Of course, telling us about your wife's MacBook doesn't make us believe you cannot Google ;-) (Can you please use upper case i's?) <comment67096> Any chance all troublesome sites use HTTPS? (Stack Exchange's authentication does so too, but that might have some fallback?) <comment67100> your first comment confuses me whether this is related or not! capital i does not solve my problem ;). yes, i googled a while from her laptop but did not find any solution! btw, no many HTTPS sites are opening fine! <comment67844> Hmm, so it's not DNS? Have you narrowed it down to http or does it happen on every port/protocol? Does pinging google work? What about `curl -v gmail.com`? <comment67890> ping to google.com, gmail.com works fine. curl to gmail redirects to a number of urls and each of them are coming fine without any problem! btw, i can access those pages from other internet connection. again, i can use those pages from other laptop using this current connection! very peculiar! :s btw, thanks for your input <comment80774> Thanks for your help! but all of a sudden this issue is resolved few days ago! probably after several updates that came through App Store. <comment80847> Sounds like the update to 10.8.1 was part of your updates. <comment80848> yes, though current version is 10.8.2  :). thanks
