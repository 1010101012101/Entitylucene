Can't run gedit for mbfan.conf <body> I have installed (Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS in MBP ll,3 model mid-2014 with Sierra MacOS) using reFind as the boot manager.  I followed this guide to take control of the fans on my laptop, A beginner's tutorial for mbpfan under Ubuntu.  This is the output  precoderoot@ubuntu:/home/blue/mbpfan-2.0.1# sudo gedit /etc/mbpfan.conf Failed to connect to Mir: Failed to connect to server socket: No such file or directory Unable to init server: Could not connect: Connection refused  (gedit:2201): Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0 /code/pre  I tried to look for other solutions and workarounds but they didn't work.  For a workaround I used vi editor and was able to edit the code.conf/code file.  I would just like to know why I encountered such errors even after several reboots?
