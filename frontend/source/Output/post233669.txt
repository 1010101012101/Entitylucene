Can I use my Mac keyboard as input to another Apple device? <body> Is it possible to use the native keyboard on one Mac, to control the keyboard input of another Apple device, especially another Mac?   And so doing, without having to completely redirect the input device, i.e. disconnecting/connecting a Bluetooth keyboard to switch it between devices.  In my setup, I have a MacBook Pro and an iMac. Ideally, on the MBP, I would like to press a keyboard command or an GUI icon to connect the built-in keyboard as input for the iMac.  supNote: Screen sharing is not a viable answer for this question./sup  <answer233692> Why don't you just use screen sharing? When connected to it you will be able to use your trackpad and keyboard with the other Mac.  Apple screen sharing  Further examples  <answer233703> I am not sure about its compatibility with El Capitan but Teleport will let you do exactly what you want. I used it for years to connect one keyboard and mouse between 3 Macs, but have not used it in awhile.  <answer233753> 1Keyboard is an OS X app that allows a Macintosh keyboard to type on another Mac, iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, Apple TV, PS3 and Android.  I followed the pairing instructions, and while it didn't work the first few tries, it does now. Once I got it up and running, it has worked just fine. Copying, Pasting, keyboard shortcuts and Media keys (Volume, Playback) are supported.  You can set keyboard commands to connect to different devices. I use kbdShift/kbd + kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbd/kbd to connect to my iMac, kbdShift/kbd + kbdCtrl/kbd + kbd/kbd to connect to my iPhone, kbdShift/kbd + kbdAlt/kbd + kbd/kbd to connect to my iPad.  <comment285549> I stated in the question that I'm not looking to use screen sharing. It may be a good solution overall for some cases, but not relevant to this question.
