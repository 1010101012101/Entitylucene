iPhone 6S will not charge to 100% <body> My iPhone 6S will not charge to 100%. I have iOS version 10.0.2 right now but I'm pretty sure it has been like this for older versions. It also usually powers off before it reaches 0% (sometimes as high as 30%) so maybe that has something to do with it.  I just downloaded http://www.coconut-flavour.com/coconutbattery to see if that might give any insight.  Is there anything else I can try?  <answer259854> iOS 10.1.1 is out now, so update to it, even though you said the problem persisted through older software updates, it can't hurt.  If a software update doesn't help, you probably need to recalibrate your battery:  ol liCharge fully (without using it)/li liUse it until your battery is completely dead/li liCharge fully again (without using it)/li liDo a hard restart by holding the both the home button and power button down until you get the Apple logo./li /ol  <answer293134> A batch of Apple's iPhone 6s models had a problem where battery reaches about 30% and switches off. This was due to a battery defect and they have opened a scheme for those affected consumers to get the battery replaced. It's not a software problem, it's a manufacturing defect.

Which is it, or is it both? <comment324968> Really both, but because I've seen questions about the low battery I'm framing this from the battery-not-charging angle instead :) <comment325160> Sounds like your battery is out of calibration, meaning the system can't determine the min and max range of charge for the battery.
