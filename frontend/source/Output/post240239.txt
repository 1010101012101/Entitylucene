Why are many songs just not played in iTunes in Apple Music? How to force them to be played? <body> I've installed iTunes on PC and have registered with Apple Music. I've started playing an album. But most of the songs are just not being played. Only one-three songs for an album are playable. What kind of issue with iTunes/Apple/Apple Music is that? How to force iTunes to play them?  Here are screenshots of the difference.  ul liA song that is playable has a grey color slider:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ASW5q.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liSongs that iTunes doesn't play have blue color slider. iTunes just freezes on those songs and never goes to the the next song in an album:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WZzCz.png" alt="enter image description here"  And no any hints except these about why Apple Music doesn't play songs.

They suggest that you change your DNS. Try using the Google Public DNS.   I would also suggest you to restart your router once.   <comment295231> This happens a lot for me. If it's an option on PC Apple Music, allow a larger playback cache so it can store more music locally. Also try downloading songs for offline listening. <comment295237> The blue line (@Green's second picture) happens to me when I listen to songs 'online'. When I download them offline, that problem doesn't happen to me. Have you tried downloading the album offline?
