Grey screen on an apple <body> I have an old imac machine. I've tried doing a single user mode boot. Nothing. I tried doing a PRAM/NVRAM reset did not happen. There was no second restart. I also tried booting to a USB drive, nothing. The keyboard is also good.   Is there anything else I could try to rule out hardware issues?  EDIT: It is an iMac G4.  <comment213543> Is it new enough to be Intel-based? If so, try an [SMC reset](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201295). For an Intel iMac, you unplug the power cord for 15 seconds, then plug back in and wait another 5 seconds, then try to power it up. <comment213561> Depending how old is it, it could be that even the PRAM battery is empty. So how old is it? <comment213643> It's one of the older iMacs. Is the battery an easy enough fix to access? Going to see if I can pull a model off it <comment213670> If you press the power button and hold the alt (option) key for a while. Does anything appear on the screen?
