Bookmarklets on IOS 8 <body> I can't find anything about this on Google, but it appears Safari on IOS8 no longer supports codejavascript:/code bookmarklets.  Can anyone confirm this?  Is there a workaround?  I'm using iPhone 6 plus if for some reason this matters.  <answer188690> I cannot confirm this. Have just tried with a bookmarklet from Instapaper and it had no problem posting a link to the page viewed. Is there a particular bookmarklet that causes you grief?  <comment223868> Everywhere I try to use a bookmark that uses the JavaScript protocol.  Safari throws an alert that says something like "JavaScript cannot be called in this way".
