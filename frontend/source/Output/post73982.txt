Search for contents inside connected iPod <body> Within iTunes 11 on Windows, they removed one of my favorite features from iTunes 10 : Searching for music within a connected iPod  For example, when listening to music that is on my iPod via iTunes, I could type in a search for "Pendulum" and have all my Pendulum songs right there. One of my favorite things was that my shuffle would stay within the research range, making that, for an afternoon, I could listen to only Pendulum if I wanted to.  Now they seem to have removed that feature, but is it just hidden somewhere and I'm not finding it?  BTW: I have no choice but to listen music from my iPod, I'm at work and can't just transfer all my music on the computer.
