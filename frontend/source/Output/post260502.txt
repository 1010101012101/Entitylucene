How to force the opening of UNetBootin? <body> I'm trying to install UNetBootin for a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2012). However, I got this message when I tried to open it. Could anyone be able to tell me what I can do to force its opening?   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NiDve.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer260510> Try right clicking on it in Finder and then clicking "Open".
