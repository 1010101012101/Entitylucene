Capturing screenshots on macOS Sierra is very slow <body> Capturing screenshots on the Mac has gotten very slow recently.  It used to be nearly instantaneous but now it is taking more than 10 seconds for the image to appear on the desktop.  I seem to recall having this problem years ago. The workaround was to delete a large accumulation of log files that the os had built up. After I deleted these log files, the screen capture worked very fast again.  Problem is that I cannot remember where these log files are. Searched for quite some time and could not find the information.  <comment331427> Have you tried something like this to delete log files? http://macpaw.com/how-to/clear-log-files-on-mac-osx <comment331475> Or [Onyx](http://www.titanium.free.fr/onyx.html), which is freeware. <comment331513> renaming ~/Library/Logs seemed to fix the problem. Not sure exactly directory within ~/Library/Logs was the culprit, but I guess it doesn't matter. Problem solved.
