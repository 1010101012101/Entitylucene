Highlight all instances of a search in Preview <body> When I use kbdCommand/kbd+kbdF/kbd to search for a word or phrase in Preview, it finds all instances of the search in the document, but only highlights the matched areas when I click on a specific page on the lefthand sidebar (that lists each page with a match and the number of matches per page).  Current behavior: I search for a word, and it finds a match on pages 1, 2, and 3. It brings me to page 1 and shows all instances of the word highlighted. If I scroll down to page 2, none of the page 2 instances are highlighted. However, if I click on page 2 on the left sidebar, it will then highlight all instances on that page.  Expected behavior: When I scroll to page 2, all instances will be highlighted without me having to click on page 2 on the left sidebar.  Is there any way to do this?  (I'm using Mac OSX 10.7.5)  <comment312466> There does not appear to be. I tested this on OS X 10.11 and it still works the same way.
