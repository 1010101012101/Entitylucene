Are there any keyboard shortcuts for using El Capitan Split View for Mac? <body> strongThis question is about Mac El Capitan SplitView/strong  I am a fan of using splitscreen views as in i3 for linux.  Or when I am on Windows I use snapping  With the new feature is there a way to use it without touching the mouse?  So far I've only seen that you can use it by setting it to fullscreen-mode and then use Mission Control for it. new-split-screen  <answer211321> There are no keyboard shortcuts to activate this feature of OS X currently. The primary way to activate it is to click and hold down the Green traffic light and select another available window to use in split screen.  <answer214758> I have found that BetterTouchTools, which I previously used for Maximizing the windows to the left and the right, NOW have support for OS X split view in their action field.   <answer230722> It can be done easily with Keyboard Maestro ($36).  Create two macros, with whatever keyboard shortcuts you like, one for the focussing the lefthand pane, and another to focus the right.  Use the strongMove and Click/strong action to strongClick/strong the strongLeft Button/strong relative to strongthe Absolute Postion/strong.  You need to set the x, y coordinates according to the size of your display. The height isn't too important (I just used the halfway point), but you'll want KM to click near to the sides of the display, so the clicks will always be in the correct pane, even if you resize them.  hr  Obviously, $36 is a lot to fix one thing, but KM can do a lot of useful stuff, so you will probably find it's worth it, especially if you like doing everything with shortcuts.  <answer236627> It's unfortunate that there aren't keyboard shortcuts for native split screen mode.  However, I use a cheaper program called strongBetterSnapTool/strong (as of 07/27/2016 is $2.99 USD in the App Store) and it does have keyboard shortcuts.   <answer237960> No shortcuts for Split Screen in El Capitan as far as I am aware.  However ShiftIt (completely free!) is amazing for this! Like just unbelievably brilliant.  Been using it since Mountain Lion.  https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/releases  FYI I am in no way associated with this software's development.  <comment253020> @MarekH there is now answer in that thread!! <comment253030> Cmd +` (that's a backtick) for swaping the focus. I deleted the answer because they wanted to swap views not to swap focus from one window to antoher. Another part of answer was Amethyst https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst <comment253040> What does "use it mean"? Do you mean is there a way to split-screen a window and pick the other window to place beside it without using the mouse? Just the keyboard? <comment259367> Note that this _isn't_ the "only" way. You can also use Ctrl+Cmd+F to make an app _independently_ fullscreen and then drag another window onto it in Mission Control. <comment281279> "without touching the mouse" <comment298324> It's so annoying that OSX doesn't support the power users anymore. <comment298326> Massive plus 1 for ShiftIt. Wonderful tool.
