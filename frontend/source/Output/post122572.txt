Glitches appear on facebook chat window when using Mac Book Pro <body> At the bottom of my Facebook chat, there are irritating glitches that I cannot unsee now.  The arrows point to the red box indicating the errors. I use the Chrome browser on Mavericks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hVeP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is this common for 2013 Retina MacBook Pro?   <comment143057> Do you also have these glitches in Safari ? <comment143061> No, there isn't any glitches in Safari.. but i like to use google Chrome <comment143082> Do you have any extensions installed? Try deactivating them <comment143083> Do these glitches appear in the latest Chrome Canary? <comment143242> Sorry everyone.
