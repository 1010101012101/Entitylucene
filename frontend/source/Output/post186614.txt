How to show dot underscore ._ files? <body> I want the OSX to show all kind of hidden files including code._/code files too. I do not know exactly what I did, but I am successful in seeing code.DS_STORE/code files, but not code._/code files. Any idea how to achieve that?  <answer186615> Open up terminal, and write:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  This makes you see dot files and hidden files in a grayish tint. You open . files with right click open. I do not know why you cannot just double click them though. If it is a problem, ask a separate question on that.  hr  Just a little bonus: You can hide files by issuing:  precodechflags hidden /path/to/file /code/pre  and unhide by issuing:  precodechflags nohidden /path/to/file /code/pre  <answer186775> The issue is that zip files just contain one string per path whilst OS X paths point to a file and also metadata and resource forks. When HFS+ directories are zipped OS X tools will put this metadata and other info into ._ files in the zip if copying to another file system. See this Ask Different question  I think (but have not found a reference) that when an OS X aware tool unzips an archive with ._ files in it will reapply them as metadata or resource forks i.e. the opposite action to the one that created the ._ files  <comment220363> You know you're unlikely to see dot underscore files on the Mac itself. It only writes them to drives that can't store the Mac's extended attributes correctly - NTFS drives etc <comment220379> OP has already done this as he sees .DS_Store issue is ._ which requires more info <comment220380> How are the drives that ._ should be on formatted? And how were the ._ files created <comment220526> Mark is right. This is exactly what I did and I tried again. I can see dot files, but not dot underscore files. <comment220527> @Mark In my particular case the files were created on a windows machine and have been zipped and sent to me on mail. On unzipping, they show me an empty folder. <comment220584> That's right, `._*` are usually Extended Attributes and are "merged" into original file on OS X file system.
