How to install working GrowlVoice from scratch on Mac OS 10.9.5 (Mavericks)? <body> As of April 2014, Google Voice apparently broke the GrowlVoice 2.0.3 interface. Since then various fixes/patches/etc have arisen. I need a procedure to reliably (re)install a working variant on Mac OS 10.9.5--I don't (yet) want to upgrade to Yosemite. I have to reinstall every time I'm forced to reboot my laptop, and on the last reboot, all my past tricks (that I can remember at least, derived from these sources) appear to be failing, with this result: "Sign in error: The operation couldn't be completed. (com.google.HTTPStatus error 404.)"  I need a "from scratch," Mac OS 10.9.5 procedure to get Growl Voice working:  ol liRemove all existing, conflicting files/artifacts./li liInstall http://www.growlvoice.com/trials/growlvoice-2.0.3.zip or some other canonical source of the App./li liFix/patch/whatever #2./li liPreferably: make the above work through reboots./li /ol  Since I'm having trouble on this latest (re)install, I need a full, autonomous procedure (to de-install emall pertinent and potentially-conflicting files/em, install GrowlVoice, install patches, etc); most if not all the procedures here appear to be partials.  <answer189766> According to this discussion, on approximately 2015-05-26, users first noticed that Google broke the API that supported GrowlVoice.
