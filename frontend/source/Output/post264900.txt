Is it possible to recover audio files deleted from iPhone without iTunes purchases? <body> Does anyone know of a program to do real data recovery on an iPhone that does not rely on iTunes backups to rescue the files?  I have a user who bought a new iPhone and none of her music moved to the new device because it was never synced with iTunes or backed up in any location. When trying to get it working she deleted the entire music library on the old device. Unfortunately none of the music files are tied to iTunes purchases, they were all imported directly to the phone years ago on some long dead laptop.  Looking for a recommendation for an iPhone data recovery app that will find audio files.  <comment332114> I don't think any software will be able to get the job done. The iPhone doesn't leave a backup option for Music. Common recovery softwares are specialized for contact, pictures, voice memos, chat messages, etc.
