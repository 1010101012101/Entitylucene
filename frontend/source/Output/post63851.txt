Network accounts are unavailable - OS X Lion 10.7.4 <body> My OS X Lion 10.7.4 Mac successfully binds to a Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller.  However every time after rebooting, I keep receiving strong"Network accounts are unavailable"/strong with a red colored color; and after a few seconds it goes away and I can log on with my Ad credentials  I have searched around in Google but I have had no luck in getting rid of this annoying message.  Has anyone experienced this kind of behavior and know how to resolve it?  <comment73894> we see this a lot at our workplace.  I beleive it's due to the time difference between getting an IP address from DHCP, registering the NetBios name, and the network layer then getting a connection to AD as a security provider.
