Sierra installation stalled <body> I downloaded Sierra on two computers. One worked normally. The second one is unable to install the upgrade. It stops at the macOS installer page. I have access to file, edit, utilities and window. The message says macOS could not be installed on your computer (2011 Mac desktop): "An error occurred installing." It says to hold down the D key until diagnostics begins but it never does. The only difference between the two computers is the amount of free disk space on them. I think this computer doesn't have enough available disk space. How do I make more when I have no access?  All advice will be gratefully received.
