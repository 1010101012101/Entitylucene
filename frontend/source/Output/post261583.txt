Input Sources Menu not working <body> I recently updated to Sierra.  Now the Input Sources Menu isn't working.  My 2 source are listed (US &amp; Unicode) but selecting them does nothing.  The checkmark doesn't move, the menu title doesn't change, and the keyboard function doesn't change.  Additionally, the "Show/Hide input source name", "Show Emoji &amp; symbols", and "Show character viewer" menu options tend to just disappear from the menu and stay gone until reboot.  Any idea what would cause this, and/or how to fix?  <answer261615> I embelieve/em I have fixed it.  Based on some pages I found, I ended up deleting some prefs:  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.HIToolbox* rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox* /code/pre  After rebooting, the menu now acts normally.  If no other problems crop up soon, I'll mark this as answered.  <comment327560> Try setting up another user account and see if you have the same problem when logged into that. <comment327592> @TomGewecke Logging into the Guest Account, it works fine.  Does that suggest it's a bad prefs file?  And if so, which one covers this stuff?)
