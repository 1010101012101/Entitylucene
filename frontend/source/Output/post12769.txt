Trigger 'Gather Windows' programmatically (or other quick way) <body> I'm trying to make myself a little script that I can run on the fly that gathers all my open windows onto the main display.  I think a good starting place would be to be able to strongtrigger Gather Windows/strong (as seen in System Preferences- Displays) strongby a shell script, AppleScript, or Automator action/strong.  Can anyone either tell me how to do the above, or strongpoint me at a utility/strong that will let me bind a key to do gather windows (freeware preferred)?  <answer12790> This article includes an AppleScript that gathers all windows.    It's the only programmatic way I know of to mimic the behaviour of the "gather windows" command in System Preferences.  <answer13431> Have you looked at the following list to see if any of these do what you want?  What Window Management Options exist for OS X?  <answer13720> Use AppleScript Editor to save the following as script or application:  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.displays"     tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell first window to click button "Gather Windows"     quit end tell /code/pre  Make sure you have enabled support for assistive devices in emSystem Preferences Â» Universal Access/em.  <comment13561> Doesn't work OMM. It just doesn't move the window onto the main screen... I do have Access for Assistive  Devices enabled.
