What is the model number for product MP2F2LL/A <body> I'd like to purchase a case at the same time as purchasing this iPad from Apple's website, but I can't seem to figure out what the actual model number is.  I can't find any reference to iPad's with A9/M9 processors.  First image is from their store page, second image is the relevant 'technical specifications' from the link at the bottom of the first image.  Thanks!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2M2m3.png" alt="iPad MP2F2LL/A"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCqzR.png" alt="Technical specifications"  <answer277018> Apparently this is the model that is coming out 3/24.  Nothing on the business purchasing site indicated this.  Sorry about the confusion.  <answer282602> iPad (5th generation)  Year: 2017 Capacity: 32, 128 GB  Model number (on the back cover):  A1822 on the iPad (5th generation) Wi-Fi  A1823 on the iPad (5th generation) Wi-Fi + Cellular
