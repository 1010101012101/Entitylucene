Or any other camera to use with ipad first edition.  <answer16943> The iPad does not support using external cameras with it, as it does not have the drivers required.  Thus, the iPad cannot use an external camera. However, the new iPad 2 has cameras.  <comment18469> Vyas: You should accept your answers if you are going to ask so many questions. People will be more inclined to answer and you will get higher quality answers as well if people know they will be rewarded for their effort.
