Mac OS X, install another keyboard layout? <body> I'm a developer and I'm just so used to using Spanish (Argentina) as my keyboard layout on my PC both at home and at work. Now I want to develop on my Macbook Pro too, but the only Spanish layouts available are "regular" and ISO, both of which are basically the same as the one I use, except I have to press the alt key to input characters that are very common for me, like {}[].  How can I set my keyboard layout to Spanish (Argentina)? Thanks a lot!  <answer35303> You might find this question to be helpful for your problem. The two tools referred to in the answers are Ukulele and Spark.  Ukulele allows you to edit keyboard layouts (thus creating the layout you want), while Spark creates shortcut key combinations, which you could use to remap a few keys to create the layout you want.  <answer35307> Would the Windows Latin American layout mentioned in this article meet your needs?  http://m10lmac.blogspot.com/2007/02/more-ways-to-type-spanish.html  <answer270028> I created this project in github for Latin American keyboard in macOS, maybe it helps you. https://github.com/neosergio/Latam-Keyboard  <comment40214> Exactly what I was looking for!
