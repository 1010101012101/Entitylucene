El Capitan: Your iCloud session has expired <body> After upgrading to 10.11, everytime when I run iTunes get this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7PdP.jpg" alt="" Enter login and password, fix for 20 minutes. How can this be fixed?  What I did:  ul lireset NVRAM./li /ul  <answer210364> I found an advice for this on Reddit: emLog out of iTunes Store account and log back in/em.  <comment253875> And your question is? Also, what have you already done to fix the problem? <comment254026> Seems it helped. <comment262311> Given that I don't have an iCloud account, don't want one, and don't care about iCloud, this popup was especially annoying.  Sometimes I think that "Think different" means "Think exactly like our product managers think you should think."
