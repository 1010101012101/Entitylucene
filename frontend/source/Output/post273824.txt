Using Blu-Ray for data backup in Sierra <body> I've tried this with a MATSHITABD-MLT UJ267AM, it recognizes CD and DVD, for both reading and writting, but when I insert a brand new BD-R to record, is not recognized, so the MacOS Sierra built-in disk burning tool doesn't come up and the Disk Utility is not showing the drive.  Don't looks like a hardware problem, because it works with empty CD and empty DVD as well.  Any hint?  <comment344289> Have you tried other disks? <comment344482> Yeah, tried different boxes, different vendors.
