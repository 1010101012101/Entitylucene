Trackpad and mouse different scrolling directions <body> Is it possible to have the trackpad scrolling direction different from mouse connected to the MBP?  EDIT: Found the solution, check my answer below.  <answer70877> Found the solution.  Apparently you can solve it using software. I downloaded Scrollreverser, which is free: http://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/  This allows you to control the scroll direction both on the mouse and trackpad separately.  Really cool.  Enjoy!  <answer95979> Another solution (the scrollreverser one didn't work for me):  ul liDownload and install SteerMouse./li liUse the following configuration:  ul liWheel:   ul liRoll Up - 3 x Scroll Down/li liRoll Down - 3 x Scroll Up/li /ul/li /ul/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5NGW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Source: http://developingandstuff.blogspot.de/2013/07/make-mouse-and-trackpad-scroll.html  <comment82292> Hum, that's weird. While the *trackpad* and the *mouse* have different configuration panels, I can't get them to interact differently. <comment139778> Sorry but for me that's no viable solution, as it's closed-source. https://twitter.com/francoisbecker/status/430639783174348800 <comment213451> @moala: right â€” as opposed to OS X, the entire source of which you can browse at will.
