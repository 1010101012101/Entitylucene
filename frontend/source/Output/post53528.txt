How do I disable automatic Downloads stack reinstantiation? <body> I have OS X 10.7.4. Sometimes when I download a file the OS deems it appropriate to create a Downloads stack in my Dock. I don't like this and would rather it didn't presume. Is there some hidden preference I can disable?  Successfully reproduced by:  ul lireceiving an Airdropped file/li /ul  Sometimes reproduced by:  ul lidownloading a file from Chrome/li lisaving an attachment from Sparrow/li /ul  <comment61234> if you remove the stack does it re-create it? <comment61235> yes, it does recreate the stack after I manually remove it. <comment61237> Are you able to recreate the issue while logged in with a different/new user profile? <comment61242> I've verified that the same behavior occurs when I'm logged in to Guest and receive an Airdropped file. <comment61311> Just an Airdropped file? OR as the same as before? I'm asking because it will define which direction to go from here. <comment61413> I may be remembering the Chrome and Sparrow entry points incorrectly. Those two have downloaded files without this behavior before. So I assume at this point it's just about Airdropping? <comment62321> I just downloaded a file with Chrome and the stack reappeared! It doesn't reappear with every Chrome download though.
