iPod Mini USB Car Connection <body> I'm trying to connect my old 2005 iPod Mini G2 (6gb) to my car using the original USB cable.  My car is a 2011 Peugeot 508 with the RT6 Nav system. When I plug my iPhone 5 into the usb (using its own cable) I can pull up the artists on the car menu as you would expect. I also tried my parents 2008-2009ish iPod classic which also worked.  Any ideas? Was this functionality only added into newer generation iPods?  Thanks  <comment143305> It's likely the Bluetooth no the cable that allows this otherwise it could also be iOs that allows it real that to say <comment143306> It connects using USB, not bBluetooth.  I've resigned myself to the fact that it is the age of the device.  Full Apple support for car kits didn't come in until late 2005, after I had this.
