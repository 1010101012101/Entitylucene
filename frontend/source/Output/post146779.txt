Open menù on fullscreen app <body> I'm using this arrangement for my notebook + 24inch monitor. I primarily work on my notebook and the big screen is used just for secondary stuff.  The problem is that i cannot use full-screen application on the lower screen because there is no way to open the menù. Usually you have to put your mouse on the top of the screen, but in this arrangement when you move the mouse to the top, it simply jumps to the other screen.  Any advices?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5Ml0n.png" alt="screen arrangement"  <answer146780> You can use keyboard shortcut to get focus on menubar with kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbdF2/kbd. This will show menubar also in fullscreen apps.  Note: when You use Your kbdF2/kbd key for brightness control, You need to add kbdfn/kbd to this shortcut to work properly.
