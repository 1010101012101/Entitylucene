Edit Multiple Places in iPhoto '11? <body> I've recently upgraded from iPhoto '08 to '11 and am in the process of cleaning up my geotagging.  Most of my photos had been geotagged outside of iPhoto, but for a lot of them it wasn't as accurate as I'd like.  So what I've done is flag all of the photos where I'd like to zero in a little more on the map.  Working one at a time I can just select the photo and, in the info pane, drag the existing pin a little bit to a new location on the map.  Works fine.  However, I have large swaths of photos which are all very nearly in the exact same spot (taken in the same room in a building, for example).  When I highlight multiple photos, though, the map in the info pane doesn't let me drag the pin.  (I'm guessing that the pin shown is for only a single photo, such as the first one selected.)  Is there a way I can re-assign the place on the map for multiple photos?  strongEdit:/strong Requested screen cap: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/64HuF.png" alt="alt text"  <answer31051> I think I've found a way. Remove any places that are already assigned to individual photos in the album/event. Then select all the photos and set a location. It should now assign that location to all the photos.  <comment9541> That's so weird considering it used to let you do it.  I'm trying to set the location of a batch and I don't want to do it one by one.  They've even got the batch change option, "place" should have been there before.  And it should be there now.
