Application Keyboard Shortcut not overriding <body> I want to always paste text without its format. Many applications, like Numbers in my case, have a shortcut for that being codeshift+alt+command+v/code. Now, that's pretty many keys to press at once so I wanted to override that with a custom keyboard shortcut as suggested in this answer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0f5x.png" alt="settings pane"br [sorry for German language, please assume that the shortcuts' names are correct]  I flipped emPaste/em's and emPaste and match style/em's keyboard commands.br Since that did not do it, I also added shortcuts for Numbers individually.  This is what Numbers' emEdit/em pane shows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKphg.png" alt="Numbers&#39; *Edit* pane"  Again, sorry for German language. the first one reads "Paste" and second reads "Paste and match style". The keyboard commands are still the wrong way.  I have restarted Numbers a number (no pun intended) of times but that didn't help. For other applications it doesn't work either.  Any ideas why it doesn't work?br Thanks in advance"  <answer252646> You need to use the exact name of the menu item. It looks like you're using "Einf√ºgen" but Numbers' menu item uses the synonym "Einsetzen". Correcting that should fix it.   <comment314360> Ugh, stupid me. Thanks a lot!
