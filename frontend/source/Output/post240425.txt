Can't sign in to the Mac App Store <body> I am trying to update to El Capitan.  I am being asked for my Apple ID and password.  I entered both correctly however I am being asked to enter a emverification/em code after the password (see screenshot).  This makes no sense, it's absurd, and very unlike Apple. Any thoughts on how to fix this?    Note:  I updated the password using the 2-step verification process, but the new password still does not work.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vSjbB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240430> This is perfectly normal behavior for an account that has Two Step Verification enabled.  In order to have enabled it, you must have a trusted device enrolled that can receive either SMS or be found by "Find My Phone" because that's the device which will receive the verification code you enter after your password.  So, just enter the verification code that Apple sent to that trusted device after your password and you will be able to access the Mac App Store.  h2How do I turn off two-step verification?/h2  ol liSign in to your Apple ID account page./li liIn the Security section, Click Edit./li liClick Turn Off Two-Step Verification./li liCreate new security questions and verify your date of birth.

You still need the normal Apple ID password to be entered in the password field. <comment295514> Even if I append the verification code to my password it still does not work.  I had to turn off 2-step verification and then login with my apple id and password. <comment295515> I've never seen apple do something like this b4, where they ask you to enter STANDARD information and then return an error saying, "No, actually the STANDARD way is not right, this is how you need to enter it"  VERY BAD UI.
