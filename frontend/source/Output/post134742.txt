Upgrading from Leopard to Mavericks <body> I have an iMac from 2008 that is currently running Leopard and I would like to upgrade to Mavericks. What ways are there to upgrade, while spending the least amount of money. Also, are there any special discounts that Apple offers to students?  <answer134744> You have to strongpurchase/strong Snow Leopard ($20 USD) and, then, upgrade to Mavericks at no cost, according to Apple's website: http://www.apple.com/osx/how-to-upgrade/  IDK if Apple has a discount program for students.  <comment159592> Yeah, **if and only if** you Mac is compatible with Mavericks. If it running Leopard, likely not. Check out this link to see. http://www.everymac.com/mac-answers/os-x-10.9-mavericks-faq/os-x-mavericks-compatible-macs-system-requirements.html <comment159607> Yep, Steve, you're right! :) <comment159612> A 2008 iMac *should* be compatible with Leopard (proof: this was posted from a mid-2007 iMac running Mavericks). <comment159632> @SteveChambers I just finished upgrading. The computer can run Mavericks with absolutely no problem. :) It starts ever so slightly slower than it did with Leopard (one or two extra seconds) but it runs just as smoothly. <comment159697> Very cool, glad to hear it!
