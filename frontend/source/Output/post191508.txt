Is this iPhone alert Trojan/Malware? <body> Once in a while I get this bizarre behavior on my iPhone 5's screen with iOS 8.3.1. (The button says 'Approve' - in Hebrew).  I can't say if its SMS/MMS or something else. But it feels like Malware.  ol liAnyone familiar with this behavior or something similar?/li liWhat should I do next?/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tESo6.png" width="320"  <answer191520> This looks like a "Flash SMS" or "class 0 message", supposedly only available to be sent by your carrier, but available to others via Apps (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) and in some carriers, by prefixing your message with code*go/code.  There are more technical details on this answer at Stack Overflow, specially in this linked article:      As per the SMS specification, after pressing “Dismiss”, the overlay and message disappear and the message is immediately discarded, leaving no trace of its delivery on the phone   I wouldn't worry much, but be sure to check your bills as it may be a sneaky way to forcing you into those pesky SMS subscription schemes, as referenced by this answer here on Ask Different.  <comment227421> Have you tried to call someone who was unavailable lately? I get similar notifications when the number I have called becomes available (but in my case I can see the number). <comment227490> Due to iOS' security model, installation of malware is next to, if not completely, impossible.
