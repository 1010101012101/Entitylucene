How do I burn a bootable CD from a .toast file? <body> I bought a used G3 couple of days ago and I want to reinstall Mac OS 9. I got the OS in .toast format. Any knows how I make that into bootable CD? Just burning with Disk Utility didn't work, although there might be a way to use that which I don't know.  <answer40295> Yup, just use Toast Titanium and burn the .toast file to a CD. That will create a bootable CD that will be usable on your G3.  Burn is a free application for burning CDs/DVDs. I don't know if it supports .toast files, but give it a try if you don't have Toast, since it may save you from buying it. I couldn't find online documentation for it, so let me know how it works.  <comment45551> There's a Mac disc burning app called Roxio Toast; that's probably what you need to use to work with a .toast file. <comment45576> toast is like Â£60 and I couldn't find any trial or something. Ill try Burn. thanks ! <comment45622> @latusaki Yeah, unfortunately it isn't free...
