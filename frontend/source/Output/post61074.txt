Some applications (like Terminal) will lose focus after switching Spaces <body> I have the following problem with Spaces in Mountain Lion:  ul li1) Open Safari (or Chrome)/li li2) Open Terminal/li li3) Give Terminal window focus/li li4) Switch to Dashboard Space (or any other Space)/li li5) Switch back to Space with Terminal/li /ul  Expected: Terminal still has focusbr Actual: Safari gets focus  This problem can also be duplicated with other applications, such as Adium in place of Terminal. I'm not sure why it affects some apps and not others.    <comment70577> I couldn't reproduce it with Safari and Terminal on 10.8. Does it depend on the settings in the Mission Control preference pane? <comment70746> Hmm, doesn't appear to depend on those settings Lri. Odd that you can't reproduce on your system. <comment73614> I can also duplicate the same problem stitching between MS Excel 2011 and Preview running 10.8.1.
