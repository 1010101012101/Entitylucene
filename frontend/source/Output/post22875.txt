How to search better in App Store <body> As an example ...  If I wanted to see all strongcommercial airplane simulator/strong games out there, how would I accomplish this without going to see title by title?  http://itunes.apple.com/au/genre/ios-games-simulation/id7015?mt=8&amp;letter=A&amp;page=2#page  As using iTunes I can only see this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FQDuz.png" alt="enter image description here"     Is there an strongexternal website / application/strong that we can easily search what are we looking for?   <answer22877> Not entirely sure if it fits the bill, but a great alternative App Store search app is strongAppShopper/strong. brIt lets you do far more advanced searches and really helps pick up bargains and special offers too!  <comment25513> I will try it, but It seams that the search is kind'a iTunes ... :/ <comment25518> it looks nice though and with the same keywords I really get apps based on commercial airplanes, very nice! Thanks
