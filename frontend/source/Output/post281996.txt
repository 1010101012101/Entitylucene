Kill mds process/disable Spotlight forever <body> The mds process, used by Spotlight, has been running wild lately, even if there’s no new content to index.  It either uses 2 to 3gb of memory or 200% CPU. Restarting fixes it for a while, but I need a longtime solution.  I tried disabling it on Terminal and by setting my whole disk as private on Spotlight settings, but it keep restarting itself.  I’m using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, Late 2011) with macOS Sierra.  <comment354997> Have you tried going back to El Cap?  I've found that the myriad of issues introduced by Sierra was easily fixed by going backward.  Is there something about Sierra that you are tied to?  If not, El Cap may be the way to go <comment356108> @Allan I'm seriously considering it.
