I short circuited my iPhone 5 through audio jack <body> Long story short, I short circuited my second most expensive asset through a usb-male-audio-male. I'm devastated. I'm not rich. I was still giddy about saving a dozen dollars during black friday sales.  I understand basic elements of circuits. So I want to fix it myself.   I suspect that the battery is down. And I suspect some excessive current protection mechanism was triggered.  The battery can be replaced easily.  So my question is that what might have been broken, and how to fix them.   If you can kindly share your knowledge, I will be grateful.  <answer218069> a reset solved the problem     Try a reset, press the top and and home button at the same time   I found this solution by sarri at fixit
