How do I mount server sparsebundle on local machine to restore? <body> I have all my Macs backing up to my server on an external Time Machine drive (Firewire 800).  When my hard drive went on my MacBook Pro 2TB in order to restore in recovery mode currently has to be done through the network with the server password to access the correct emmacbookname.sparsebundle/em.   Once the external drive is connected to my MacBook Pro directly,  is there a way to mount emmacbookname.sparsebundle/em using the proper username and password, so when I enter the "Restore from Time Machine" it sees the sparsebundle as a mounted local drive for restore?  I am using macOS X 10.12.4  and the macOS Server version is 5.3.  I've noticed some documents on mounting the server sparsebundle through the network but that is too slow... and using the standard way would take 40 hours.  <comment353941> Do you use the server's Time Machine service feature? Does your MBP provide a FireWire 800 interface? If not, do you have FireWire 800  Thunderbolt adapter?
