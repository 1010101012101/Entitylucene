Use trackpad for annotation in Preview without clicking <body> Is there a way to annotate PDF's without clicking the trackpad? Something more like writing on paper.  I love that markdown lets us annotate stuff to PDF's using preview. But its slightly impractical - always having to press down.  Is there an app or a toggle which can let me go into writing mode so that I don't need to keep the trackpad clicked while "writing" so to say.  <answer272577> If your MacBook has a Force Touch trackpad, you can use the Draw tool instead of the Sketch tool.     Draw subsubsubimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fxmrA.png" width="50"/sub/sub/sub      Draw a shape using a single stroke. Press your finger more firmly on the trackpad to draw with a heavier, darker line.      This tool appears only on computers with a Force Touch trackpad.   suphttps://support.apple.com/kb/PH20218/sup  <comment342566> I don't have a Force Touch trackpad. I'm using a 2014 Macbook Air :(
