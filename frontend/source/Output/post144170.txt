Use "options ndots:2" in global DNS resolver <body> Until yesterday, I regularly ssh'd into my servers that have names like "codeserver.prod.example.com/code" as "codeserver.prod/code" and it worked fine.  (Actually, this required getting mDNSResponder to start with the "code-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains/code" option, but that's a different story.  I think.)  Very recently, the ".prod" TLD was made active.  Now when I try to log into "codeserver.prod/code", it resolves to 127.0.53.53.  This is a universal DNS problem and is solvable on other BIND-based DNS resolvers by adding "codeoptions ndots:2/code" to the resolver configuration (normally "code/etc/resolv.conf/code").  Is it possible to set this option with MacOS's scutil/configd-based resolver?  I'll point out that the resolver seems to recognize the option when put in a resolver config file in "code/etc/resolver/code": when placed there, "codescutil --dns/code" shows the option.  Of course, it does no good there.  I'm on Mavericks, if that makes any difference.  <answer144566> I have this same issue. I was able to easily fix this on my linux desktop by adding the line to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head  OSX is a different beast though, hoping someone smarter than I am can find a way. I miss being able to "ssh server1.prod" :(  The alternative is to set up "ssh" as an alias to a script, and the servername is your $1. The script can see if the last 5 chars of $1 are ".prod" and if so ssh to the fqdn.
