Finder open new Finder tab in the same directory <body> Is it possible to configure finder in Mavericks to open new tab (by clicking plus sign or cmd+t) in the same directory by default?  <answer117757> No, there's no option to do this. The new tab uses the following setting from Finder preferences. There's no option to use the current location or a different location for tabs.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ri3Uf.png" width="300"  <answer117807> There is another way to accomplish opening a new tab in the same location, if you don't absolutely need to have it as standard.   Open a Finder window and make sure that the Path bar is shown either by going to View - Show Path Bar or by pressing kbd⌥/kbdkbd⌘/kbdkbdP/kbd. You then get the folder hierarchy in a bar at the bottom of the window. Just hold  kbd⌘/kbd and double click any item in that bar to open that folder in a new tab (or new window if not using tabs).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MwdIu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer124755> Another similar approach to the one described by Lizzan but which doesn't need the path bar to be visible is to Cmd-click on the current folder in the title bar of your Finder window. This drops down a list of the hierarchical path to the current folder - so the 2nd entry in the list (after the current folder itself) is the parent of the current folder. If you cmd-click on the parent folder it will open in a new tab. To minimise the clicks required if you cmd-click and hold the cmd-click down then when you release it on the parent folder it will open in a new tab.  This approach is very useful if the folder you want in the new tab is actually a sibling of the current folder in the path hierarchy.  <answer128484> It's possible to create a automator action and turn it to a service, which you can assign a keyboard shortcut too.  Open automator  select create new service  where it says "service receives selected" choose [files or folder]  where it says "in" choose [Finder.app]  Then find the automator action "reveal finder items" and drag it in. That's it. Save it as a service and then go to keyboard prefs and assign it something like ⌃⌘O. Now when you have a folder selected in finder and do that shortcut it will open a new tap to that location.  It's not perfect. I think I like the Command click title and then command click folder technique better but I thought I'd put it out there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBpx0.png" alt="automator setup"  Please write to apple in their feedback page requesting an official finder preference for "new Finder tabs show:" [last opened directory] or [current directory] Maybe they will include in 10.10.  <answer135245> There's a Finder add-on/replacement called TotalFinder, which has (among other finder tweaks) an option to open new tabs with the location of the last active tab/window.  It's commercial software ($18USD at the time of writing) so probably only worth it if you also want its other features &amp; tweaks.  <answer217298> Press strongcodecmd + ctrl + o/code/strong in Finder without any selection (otherwise you will open-tab to the selection if it's a folder instead).  codecmd + ctrl + o/code will open stronga new tab/strong in the strongsame folder/strong as the strongcurrently/strong opened folder.  No need for any extra things in OS X for this ;-)  <comment271240> we should mark this as the answer. As it replies the question in the most direct way with the least extra work. <comment284065> Where did you find this functionality? I actually spoke to a Senior Advisor at apple who told me this wasn't possible! <comment285433> Well - it is possible, isn't it? <comment286423> unnecessary, look below <comment311989> Maybe a dumb question, but how do you achieve "without any selection" if one already has something selected? <comment312267> @MattTagg: just click somewhere outside the active selection <comment312268> Not true, see above <comment312320> @PJJ The question was asking for a way to set it as '**default**'. This answers that question as there is no way to set it as default.
