But now I don't see that my messages are delivered on Mac.  And what will happen if I turn iMessages on iPad on?

The messages are end-to-end encrypted for each receiving device.br In other words: Your new device can't decrypt the old messages, as the original sender didn't know about this new device.    See this article:     You’ve actually got one set of keys for each device you add to iCloud,   and each iMessage is encrypted independently for each device. So if   you have two devices — say, an iPad and an iPhone — each message sent   to you is actually encrypted (AES-128) and stored on Apple’s servers   twice. Once for each device. When you pull down a message, it’s   specifically encrypted for the device you’re on.
