Does the Preview app have a freehand pen/pencil tool? <body> The Preview app has markup / annotate tools like rectangle, oval, line, text, speech bubble, thought bubble.  Is there a pen or pencil tool that lets you draw lines in a freehand way?  (I'm using Preview version 7.0 (826.4) in OS X Mavericks 10.9.5)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTL32.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uFTSI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer173637> Yes, Preview in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) has a freehand tool.  Access it within Preview from the "Markup Toolbar" icon of the .JPG or .PDF file you have open.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XM0tF.jpg" alt="OS X Preview tool &quot;markup toolbar&quot; icon"   When you click on that icon, the Markup toolbar appears, and the freehand "sketch" tool is the 3rd icon from the left, in blue in the image below.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DWJsB.jpg" alt="OS X Preview tool &quot;sketch&quot; tool"   and it offers a smoothing option as well as a freehand mode.  <comment204288> Just as a side note: there _is_ a freehand sketch tool under OS X 10.10, though this may not be the prime reason to upgrade for you. <comment204319> Thanks @Charles_Lindsay!  Alas, I'm still on Mavericks, reluctant to switch to Yosemite, so I don't have the freehand tool.  Nice to know it is in Yosemite though.  Maybe one of these days I'll take the risk and upgrade to Yosemite. <comment320791> Any way to make Preview suggest replacements but not automatically replace? So to make it keep the origina√∂ drawing? <comment343200> An additional (side) note: if you are simply looking for a freehand tool, and don't mind discarding Preview, you might give [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) a try. Skim has an excellent freehand drawing tool.
