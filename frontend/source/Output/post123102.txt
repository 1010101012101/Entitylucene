Why is dragging photos to my Flickr icon confused with Photostream upload? <body> This is really weird. I recently upgraded from OS X 10.8.5 to 10.9.2, and from Aperture 3.4.2 (whatever was most current under Mountain Lion) to Aperture 3.5.1. Today I tried dragging a photo from my Aperture library to the Flickr icon under "Shared," and the drag is possible, but the photo is not uploaded.  I disabled, then reenabled my Flickr account in Aperture, and now uploading works via contextual menu "Share  Flickr". But it still doesn't work to drag files to the "Flickr" icon in the sidebar; in fact, Aperture seems to interpret the drag as one to the Photostream icon (i.e. I see the sync icon appear briefly next to it).  Any idea as to what could be wrong? I've also tried deleting and reinstalling the app.
