How to move this window? <body> I just updated Filezilla, but now it moved strangely out of the screen bounds. CF screenshot.  I haven't found any way to make it appear entirely: the upper bar is unreachable and the app edges can only resize it! Anyone knows?  Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9YU6H.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer150483> See this question You'll need to give the script emaccess for assistive devices/em in, depending on OS version, Accessibility, or Security and Privacy System prefs.  Once that's done, this script should work for you:  precodetell application "System Events"     tell application "Filezilla" to activate     set position of window 1 of application process "Filezilla" to {100, 100} end tell /code/pre  <answer150495> Quit Filezilla, go to code~/.filezilla//code and open codefilezilla.xml/code with a text editor. Search for codename="Window position and size"/code, enter appropriate values and save the file. On my 1200p x 1920p monitor it looks like this: code&lt;Setting name="Window position and size" type="string"&gt;0 10 33 1463 920 &lt;/Setting&gt;/code    (I don't know what the leading 0 means but 10 is the distance to the left, 33 is the distance to the top, 1463 is the x-size and 920 probably should be the y-size of the window; my real y-size was about 1045)  <comment177105> does it implies i have to develop my own Apple Script? <comment177123> @Martin -Added script that should work for your App. <comment177130> thanks, but there are some quicker ways to do this apparently. +1 anyway for the time you spent on the script ;)
