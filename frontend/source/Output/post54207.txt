Can Disk Utility and Disk Warrior be used on a Fusion volume containing Mac OS X <body> I have Snow Leopard Server 10.6.8 running in a VMware Fusion 4.1.3 virtual machine.  When I run a Disk Utility "Verify Disk" from within the VM, errors are reported.     Invalid B-tree node size      The volume   could not be verified completely.      Error: This disk needs to be repaired. Start up your   computer with another disk (such as your Mac OS X installation disc),   and then use Disk Utility to repair this disk.   I have successfully mounted the .vmdk volume using VMDKMounter.app (from Fusion 3) after installing Fuse for OS X 2.4.2.  The problem is that both Disk Utility &amp; Disk Warrior want to unmount the volume before making repairs.  Both apps then produce error dialogs.  Is there a way of running these utilities on a Fusion volume?  <answer61404> Both Disk Warrior and Disk Utility will work on a .vmdk mounted volume using the VMDKMounter.app strongIF/strong the .vmdk is not damaged.  I created a new .vmdk, recopied the drive image and both Disk Warrior 4.4 and Disk Utility worked fine.  It appears that if the .vmdk becomes damaged somehow, the normal tools I use will not work.  Keeping good backups appears to be even more important when you add Virtual Machines to the mix.
