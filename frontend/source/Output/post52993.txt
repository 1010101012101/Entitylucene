How to find all files that are larger than 1GB on the Mac HD? <body> It seems that either one of these commands can be used:  precodesudo find / -size +1G sudo find / -type f -size +1G /code/pre  But when it gets to code/Volumes/code, it actually look at all the back up files by Time Machine in the external hard drive. (and another hard drive for data).  I was going to cd to code/Volumes/Macintosh HD/code and start the codefind/code there using codefind ./code instead of codefind //code, but then I did an codels/code and there is a codeVolumes/code right there again.  Any option to use the Finder as well (the GUI)?  Another thing I found puzzling is that none of the manpage of codefind/code on Mac OS Lion or on the web mentioned the code+1G/code... all they mentioned were the format code1G/code for exact match.  <answer52998> How about this command:  precodefind / -type f -size +1G /code/pre  <answer53000> You can use the code-x/code to avoid traversing mounted drives:  precode-x      Prevent find from descending into directories that have a device number different than that of the file from which the descent         began. /code/pre  You command should then be  precode$ sudo find -x / -type f -size +1G /code/pre  Regarding the fact about the missing documentation: is not missing is just not easy to find. At the end of the codePRIMARIES/code section of the man page     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be preceded by a plus sign ("+") or a minus sign ("-").  A preceding plus sign means "more than n", a preceding minus sign means "less than n" and neither means "exactly n".   <answer53001> If you want to go for a GUI tool, I use  http://www.whatsizemac.com/ or http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnidisksweeper/  Whatsize can also find duplicates an has some extra features.  <answer53036> This will probably come out with slightly different results than find but you could use Spotlight. This method is far faster than traversing every file on the drive using codefind/code  In a Finder window, start a Spotlight search and choose the File Size and also System files from the drop down menu. (look for the + under the search field on the top right)img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ymFss.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you are looking to do this on the command line, you can use:  precodemdfind "kMDItemFSSize &gt;$[1024*1024*1024]" /code/pre  In a test on my machine, the Spotlight search didn't find a couple of large files that were in the trash or one or two system files (like sleepimage). It also treated packages (such as applications and some VM images) differently from codefind/code. On the upside though mdutil was nearly instant rather than taking a few minutes for the find command to trawl through my disk.  <answer267556> This will find folders too which is useful when low in disk space and deciding what to delete.  du -h 2/dev/null | grep "G "  Note that whitespace after the G should be a tab and not a space.  <comment60595> you mean just remove the `sudo`?  But I want to find any system file that is more than 1GB too... (such as `.dmg` downloaded by the App Store) <comment70540> And it doesn't solve the problem anyway because drives mounted in `/Volumes` are typically readable without sudo.
