Having problems changing shortcut keys combination for input source <body> Good morning everybody! I'm trying to change the keyboard combination keys for my input source from "control+space" to "command+space" but it wont budge. System prefrences instructs: "To change a shortcut, select it, click the key combination, and then type the new keys. Now, either im an idiot, or this just dosent work. any help?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mukUP.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer257086> You now need to click again on the shortcut alone at the far right.  Then you will be able to enter a new shortcut by typing it.
