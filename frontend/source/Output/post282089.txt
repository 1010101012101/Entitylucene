Creating physical escape key on new MacBook Pro with TouchBar by altering .keylayout for § key <body> The UK keyboard layouts for the TouchBar MacBook Pro's have a pretty useless §/± key at the top left that would be a perfect to use as a physical escape key (see this image).  macOS has a keyboard mapping system (/Library/Keyboard Layouts/ - eg. see http://www.gingerbeardman.com/UK.keylayout/ and https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2056/_index.html ) that allows keys to be changed around.  It seems possible to me that putting a line into the relevant keyboard layout similar to:  precode&lt;key code="&lt;code for that key&gt;" output="&amp;#x1B;" /&gt; /code/pre  should allow me to make that key an escape key. (If I can find/create the layout for all the other keys too!)  Googling I've not found anyone mentioning they've done this, which seems odd to me. Is there some reason this wouldn't work? Can the TouchBar keyboard be remapped with a .keylayout file without losing any functionality?  I've been holding off buying a new macbook pro because of fear of losing the physical escape key! I know you can remap ctrl/cmd/etc to be Escape using System Preferences, but that seems like a poor solution in comparison.  <answer282092> Open System Preferences - select keyboard. Then select strongModifier Keys.../strong towards the bottom right of the window.  I have escape assigned to the caps lock key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V1WO8.png" alt="enter image description here"  I agree using the control keys for escape is poor, but the caps lock key works very well. In practice, I've not really had any issue learning to use the soft escape key. Having caps lock is far faster once I got used to it due to decreased travel distance from the home row.  <answer293164> ol liInstall Karabiner-Elements/li liRun it form the Launchpad (obviously)/li liIn "Simple Modifications" tab create a mapping "non-us-backlash" to "escape"/li liEnjoy!/li /ol  BTW key code for "§" is 0A (as reported by Karabiner Event Viewer)  img src="https://i.imgur.com/xrbnjLn.png" alt=""  <comment355181> What key are you going to use if not caps lock or the included ones Apple makes very easy and configurable? <comment355244> @bmike The §/± key at the top left of the UK keyboard layout - see this image to see the key I'm talking about: http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1570365/macbook-pro-touch-bar.jpg - it's a useless key that I've never used for it's intended purpose on any mac! <comment355523> Wow - I missed that part entirely. Let's see if I can find any options to remap that. My answer isn't that flexible with the "easy" remap option. <comment355548> @bmike Thanks! Yeah. It's an interesting option not really available on US keyboard maps. :-) I hope it's achievable with a .keylayout. I've actually ordered the MacBook Pro Touchbar now so will be able to experiment when it arrives.
