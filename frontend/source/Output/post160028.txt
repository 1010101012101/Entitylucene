FaceTime is restricted but not on restrictions list <body> I don't know what happened, but suddenly my FaceTime app is missing. I can't find it neither on any of my settings nor on my home screen. However, I can see it on my notifications setting. I tried to FaceTime someone once using Siri but she said FaceTime is restricted on my iPhone.  <comment188124> Does it appear in search results? <comment188126> Is this device managed by a mdm or a supervised device?
