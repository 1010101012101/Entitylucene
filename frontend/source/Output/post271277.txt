Installation on SD card messed up Sierra partition <body> I've got a 2011 MBP with two partitions on the main drive, one with ML and one with Sierra. I'd downloaded a Mavericks installer on the Sierra partition to install on a SDHC card.  The installation went fine, and I removed the SD card to boot from the Sierra partition again and this is when the problems started.  I started getting kernel panics on boot, and when falling back to the ML partition, I a crash report with the following message:  precodepanic(cpu 0 caller 0xffffff800283e3af): "imageboot_mount_image: di_root_image failed: 2\n"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2422.115.4/bsd/kern/imageboot.c:142 Backtrace (CPU 0), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff8153e43d30 : 0xffffff8002422f79  0xffffff8153e43db0 : 0xffffff800283e3af  0xffffff8153e43e00 : 0xffffff800283e584  0xffffff8153e43e20 : 0xffffff80027ae198  0xffffff8153e43f90 : 0xffffff800243abf8  0xffffff8153e43fb0 : 0xffffff80024d7607   BSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task Boot args: container-dmg=file://localhost/Applications/Install%20OS%20X%20Mavericks.app/Contents/SharedSupport/InstallESD.dmg root-dmg=file://localhost/BaseSystem.dmg /code/pre  I interpreted this as if the installer was missing from the correct place, so I made sure it was in the folder from where I ran it, which prompted the following crash report:  precodeSat Jan 28 11:05:52 2017 panic(cpu 2 caller 0xffffff80005ce524): "Process 1 exec of /sbin/launchd failed, errno 85"@/SourceCache/xnu/xnu-2422.115.4/bsd/kern/kern_exec.c:3836 Backtrace (CPU 2), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff8179453df0 : 0xffffff8000222f79  0xffffff8179453e70 : 0xffffff80005ce524  0xffffff8179453ef0 : 0xffffff80005ae467  0xffffff8179453f10 : 0xffffff80005e2bc1  0xffffff8179453f50 : 0xffffff8000220b3b  0xffffff8179453f80 : 0xffffff80002dca73  0xffffff8179453fa0 : 0xffffff80002f3942    BSD process name corresponding to current thread: init  Boot args: -x /code/pre  I couldn't figure out how to change the boot args for when booting with multiple partition choices, but I did attempt at booting into recovery mode and repairing the disk /disk permissions without any success.  I'd rather not re-install the Sierra partition, any advice on how to restore it?  <comment340997> How did you even get the Mavericks installer to run when booted to Sierra? <comment340998> I ran the Mavericks installer from the Mountain Lion partition. <comment341002> ah, OK. 'cos I was stumped trying to run an El Cap installer today, from Sierra :/ Had to make a USB boot key. <comment341007> Ah yes, no downgrading like that!
