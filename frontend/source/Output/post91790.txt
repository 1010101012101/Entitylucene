Adding metadata for films/TV shows in iTunes <body> When I purchase videos from iTunes, I get a lot of metadata information on the movie. For example, like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hO10H.png" alt="enter image description here"  But when I add a DVD I own, I only get this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OjH6U.png" alt="enter image description here"  I understand that on OSX you can use Subler to add iTunes metadata for videos, but how can I do this in Windows?  <answer91793> Any program that can tag MP4s should work fine. MetaX seems to be a popular one for Windows that can pull data from various online databases.  <answer149148> You can do this by editing the metadata in iTunes itself. Select a video, hit kbdctrl/kbd+kbdI/kbd then edit the data.   <comment176816> Needless to say, the answer is definitively "no".
