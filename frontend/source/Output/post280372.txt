bindkey not working from inside .cshrc file <body> Here is my .cshrc:  precodeecho Enter bindkey ^Z run-fg-editor bindkey ^[OA history-search-backward bindkey ^[OB history-search-forward bindkey ^[[A history-search-backward bindkey ^[[B history-search-forward echo Exit /code/pre  "Enter" and "Exit" both get printed, but the keybinding is not working. If I try to execute the same commands, or source the .cshrc again, it works. Can anyone tell me what is happening?  precodetcsh --version tcsh 6.18.01 (Astron) 2012-02-14 (x86_64-apple-darwin) options wide,nls,dl,bye,al,kan,sm,rh,color,filec /code/pre
