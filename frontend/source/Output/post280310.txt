Issues after macOS Sierra upgrade <body> I recently updated to macOS Sierra on my MacBook Air. I have started noticing that desktop applications will startup automatically.  I have noticed this with Facetime and Slack. Whenever I access Facebook via Google Chrome, Facetime tends to open up and when I access Slack in the browser, the Slack desktop application starts up.  I have checked that I have not set any shortcut keys and it keeps happening frequently. Has anyone else noticed this issue? What can I do to stop it?   <answer280311> Be sure you do not have any OS updates left: Upgrade OS X operating system  Be sure your Google Chrome is up-to-date and check Settings - Extensions  Let me know
