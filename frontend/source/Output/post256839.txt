SD Card unreadable on all devices <body> I usually never have any issues with my camera or Macbook Pro. Last night I inserted my SD card into my macbook pro, and none of my photos popped up as they usually do. I then decided to place the SD card back into the camera, and my Canon camera said there was No Card in Camera. So I thought that was strange because it never happened before. I tried blowing inside of the card reader, and cleaning it, but I still got the message that there was No Card in Reader. I also tried using an SD card reader, but my Macbook did not recognize it as a device. The reader physically lit up as if it was connected, but I could not get it to mount or show up as a device. Is there anything at all I can do to save my data, or is everything lost forever?  <comment320486> Start a Terminal and run `ls /dev/disk?` without the SD card inserted, then insert the card, wait 5 seconds and run the same command again to see if the Mac even detects it as a drive. If it does, there will be an additional disk listed the second time and you have a chance of recovery. Whatever you do, do not write on the card - lock it if it has a Write Protect tab.
