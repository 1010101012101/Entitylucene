Minimizing process's memory usage <body> After upgrade to Lion OS X I've noticed new "Safari Web Content" process which is separate from the Safari.app itself. And after some time it starts using huge amounts of memory (so far, 1.2G real memory logged). Is there a way to limit process's real memory usage to, say, 500M?  <answer22889> There's been a couple of threads about this issue on SuperUser. I was just looking mostly for information on the ulimit command but that apparently doesn't work, it seems like there may be some solutions on that link though.  <comment25528> Interesting. This may be related to this currently active question/discussion - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22880/after-installing-lion-my-mac-became-super-slow/22882#22882 (safari using alot of memory) <comment25555> Unused memory is wasted memory.   :-)
