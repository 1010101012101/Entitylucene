Use pkg-config with Homebrew installed software <body> I have installed some libraries with Homebrew but if I use pkg-config it does not find them because there are missing .pc files.  For example, if you do:  precodebrew install opencv /code/pre  and, after it is installed:  precodepkg-config --libs opencv /code/pre  I get this error:  precodePackage opencv was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `opencv.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'opencv' found /code/pre  This error is caused because Homebrew does not create any codeopencv.pc/code.  Is there a way to configure Homebrew to create the .pc files so that all packages installed with brew can be found by pkg-config?  <answer114126> Check with codebrew ls opencv/code that there is no codeopencv.pc/code installed.  I tried it and I have one.  If you don't get one, then there is a bug in the package.  Otherwise, check that you are using the correct Homebrew codepkg-config/code.  Check with codewhich pkg-config/code and codels -l $(which pkg-config)/code where it is coming from.  <answer270517> This post fixed it for me. It explains how to set a missing environment variable for codepkg-config/code that points to all the installed packages.  https://prateekvjoshi.com/2013/10/18/package-opencv-not-found-lets-find-it/  <comment264365> Thanks! this led me to report a bug in the `webkitgkt` package.
