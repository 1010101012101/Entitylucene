How to add a reminder to a specific list and time via Siri <body> I can say " Add codecall friend/code to my Work list " and Siri will add that reminder to the specific reminder list codeWORK/code. However, if I imply any time, it will add it as a calendar entry.br Yet when I say " remind me to call friend on Thursday ", Siri will add the reminder on that day and at 9AM ...   But I would like to choose my own date and time for reminders while specifying which reminder list it goes in, how can I accomplish this ?  strongEDIT/strong  I managed to find this method :  ul liMe : Remind me to call friend on thursday at 11am/li listrongSiri/strong : Here is your reminder, shall I create it ?/li liMe : Move it to my emname/em list/li /ul  And then the reminder is moved to your specific list. However, I would rather avoid having to do this longwinded method, is there a way to skip step 2 and combine them all in one sentence ?  <answer115105> Found it!     Add "stronglist name/strong" reminder "strongnew item/strong" on "strongdate and time/strong"   Example: "Add activities reminder basketball practice on friday at 2pm."  Odd and slightly backwards syntax but works!  <comment134785> Perfect !! Haha how did you even think of that !! <comment134926> I searched, combined, an tried a couple hundred different ways until siri was happy!  I have used this method half a dozen times since. Really useful.
