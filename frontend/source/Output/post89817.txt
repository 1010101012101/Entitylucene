How to keep window from moving? <body>    Is there a way to lock a window in place?    It's quite frustrating when I get a window in the exact location and I accidentally move it (by a Witch shortcut or by mouse).  I'd like to know how to do this globally. For emall/em windows, regardless the application.  I'm using OSX 10.7.5, MBP, mid 2011.  <comment105494> Please explain in more detail what you are talking about. What windows for which app. What shortcuts. custom? Or built in .....how are you moving it with the mouse by accident do you have double tap or three finger drag enabled <comment105555> @markhunte For **any** window. I just want to lock it in place. It could be Firefox, Safari, OpenOffice, etc. I just want to lock a window in place. It has nothing to do with shortcuts. The shortcuts I used were only to get the window **in** place. And as I posted, it's by shortcut or by mouse when I accidentally move it. <comment105557> Thanks much clearer.I do not think you can "Lock" windows in place.Running an app or script that constantly monitors every app and ever window and jiggles the windows back to where you want them may be close. But writing a script or program to do all that would be immense. Doing it for one or two apps maybe not so much but still most likely a lot of coding. I have written an app that maps and resets an apps windows but does not monitor. Unfortunately it is not for public release.
