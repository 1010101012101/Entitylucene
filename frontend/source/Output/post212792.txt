"The application can't be opened" error with code -36 <body> I'm building a virtual file system, and am sometimes getting the following event.  How can I discover what it means? What is code-36/code code for?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIrZJ.png" alt="Finder error"  Edit:  Getting the same error in other context (create directory): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EK7kY.png" alt="Create dir"  <comment256924> [This post](http://superuser.com/questions/898124/the-application-someapp-app-can-t-be-opened) on SuperUser will help you out. Report back if you have questions <comment256930> @agentroadkill the problem is not with the app but with the files I'm working with. Somehow I'm messing with the files and folders and operations are failing. My main concern is the error code. <comment256931> If you're having dot file problems I feel bad for you son, look [here](http://osxdaily.com/2015/02/21/fix-error-code-36-finder-mac-os-x/) <comment256965> did the second comment solve your issue? <comment257063> @agentroadkill it seems like it may be the case. I'm still investigating, will update when I know for sure. thanks
