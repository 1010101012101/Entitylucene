Performing unit conversions in Spotlight <body> Is there a way to perform unit conversions from within Spotlight?  For example I want to convert 1 ft^3 to cm^3 in spotlight.    <answer64778> There isn't really any way to customize the Spotlight menu or add features to it.  I know it would be nicer to display the results inline, but it doesn't take that long to search with Google either:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6rSs9.png" alt=""  There are some Alfred extensions that use Google's calculator API or Wolfram Alpha's API, but they display the results as notifications, so you can't copy them as text.  <comment100145> Apple's Calculator app has that ability and it should be implemented into Spotlight.
