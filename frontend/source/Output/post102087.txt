PDF annotation tool for Mac OS <body> What is the Mac OS application that provides most similar function as PDF annotator in Windows?   I just want a program that enables simple annotating functions in Mac OS.  Of course, freeware is preferred.  Add: Thank you for recommending Preview.  But I need a little more advanced features than Preview. Any recommendation?  <answer102088> You can use Preview to annotate PDFs, make circles, arrows, texts, and even sign it.  It comes with OS X.  <answer102089> Preview (which comes with OS X) will do simple annotations.  In the toolbar, look for the edit icon: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1LNN.png" alt="edit icon"  Click on this icon, and you'll see a new toolbar appear which lets you create squares, circles, speech bubbles, text notes, sticky notes, and more.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9zIU.png" alt="Toolbar"  Then you can save the file as normal.  <comment120250> What specific features do you need?
