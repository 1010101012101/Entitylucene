What have I done to Preview in Yosemite? <body> I used to open the annotations toolbar and I could select, for example, the arrow tool. Then I would click from A to B and draw the arrow.  Now when I click the arrow tool it plops an arrow on the screenshot and I have to manually drag both ends.  This seems like extra work compared to the old way, what am I likely to have done to have caused this and what can I do to fix it?  <answer153888> I just tested this. Clicking the Arrow tool does indeed simply add an arrow instead of having you drag it out first.  I rarely if ever use the Annotate toolbar, so I am certain I have not made any changes that would have caused this. More likely, the upgrade to Yosemite changed how this tool works.  <comment183654> I totally agree. Now it's so annoying to work with it that I will probably move to Skitch. I was so happy with the previous arrow functionality :( <comment183742> What's worse it is the same for all the tools in that bar. Not one works "as expected". Shame really. <comment183743> Point of comment, this seems to be the case for all annotations, not just arrows, I just chose that as an example. <comment271499> Very bad news. This just went a lot worse. It was very handful and now I need to use Skitch to have something similar
