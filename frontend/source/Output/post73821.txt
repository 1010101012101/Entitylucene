Is there any keyboard shortcut to turn on and off shuffle and turn on repeating on iTunes? <body> Is there any keyboard shortcut to turn on and off shuffle and turn on repeating on iTunes? They aren't mentioned on iTunes help section Keyboard Shortcut.  <answer73824> ol lifind repeat and shuffle in iTunes menus and memorize their name as is./li liPress kbdCommand/kbdkbdSpace/kbd, Type codeKeyboard/code and press kbdenter/kbd./li liselect kbdKeyboard Shortcuts/kbd/li liin left side of the page, find codeApplication Shortcuts/code and select it./li liclick kbd+/kbd button below/li liin front of codeApplication/code, choose iTunes/li litype the exact name of the menu item for shuffle and repeat /li liset shortcut keys for them./li /ol  <answer120118> Here's an answer for fellow Win 7 users: type the sequence kbdAlt/kbd+kbdC/kbd+kbdS/kbd+kbdT/kbd to toggle Shuffle. (A little harder to remember than your basic shortcut, but it does the job. You'll just be selecting each menu in turn.)  <answer167096> iTunes 12 has broken the original Keyboard pane fix. Now Shuffle is a dropdown with two options unhelpfully named emOn/em and emOff/em.  strongThe following steps work for the current version of iTunes (v12):/strong  ol liOpen the strongKeyboard/strong preferences pane in the System Preferences App./li liGo to the strongShortcuts/strong tab/li liClick on strongApp Shortcuts/strong in the left sidebar/li liClick the strongplus icon/strong below the list on the right/li liSelect strongiTunes/strong from the Application dropdown/li liType the word strongOn/strong into the Menu Title box./li liClick on the strongKeyboard Shortcut/strong box and press the key combination you want to use to turn shuffle on. I use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd./li liClick strongAdd/strong./li liRepeat steps 4-7 for turning shuffle off, but this time use strongOff/strong as the Menu Title and strongemchoose a different keyboard shortcut/em/strong for it. I use kbdCmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdS/kbd for turning shuffle off./li /ol  <answer258262> For nested Menu options like this one shown in the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NObIW.png" alt="Nested Menu Option"  A shortcut can be added by specifying the Menu Item name as: strongControls-Repeat-One/strong  For some older versions of OSX, this works: strongControlsRepeatOne/strong  You can see it solves the problem of two different nested menu items having the exact same name. Cause the full path will always be different.  <comment85784> Where is spotlight located (thing you mention on 2)? I'm beginner so please be patient. <comment85785> Press Command(The key that looks like the logo of this website) + Space, or you can find it in the top right of the screen(the magnifier icon) <comment85786> Sorry I forget to tell this: I'm in Windows 7. Not Mac OS. Then i can find the magnifier icon, but after type `Keyboard`, I don't see `Keyboard Shortcuts`. <comment85792> I don't think the short key assignment would work in Win7, but in Mac when you type keyboard the top hit would lead you to a setting screen which has a button named `Keyboard shortcuts` <comment85793> by the way, in win7 does iTunes have a menu? if so, see if they already have a short key. (it should be written in front of their names in their menu items) <comment118296> For iTunes 11: I added two keyboard shortcuts, namely CMD + SHIFT + S for "Turn On Shuffle" and CMD + SHIFT + S for "Turn Off Shuffle". Works like a charm. Thanks. <comment237742> Note that "Off" is not a unique menu action anymore; Repeat is a dropdown with "Off", "All", and "One" as options. The steps above happen to work for turning shuffle off, but only because that's considered the first item named "Off". These steps don't work for creating a shortcut to turn off repeat. <comment251315> Is there a workaround for turning off repeat? This is such arcane magic; are the incantations documented anywhere?
