Max memory for 21" 2007 iMac? <body> Have a 2007 21" imac. friend installed 2, 4GB memory for me, Apple genius says that's what causing slow downs on my machine? when they tested it only had a 4GB &amp; a 2GB cards, so someone along the way did a switch on me. Apple says my machine can only handle 4GB total. i wonder if that's true? seems like it ran quite well for a long time, &amp; it used to corroborate that it had 8 GB memory, so something fishy has occurred. machine is running quirky &amp; would like to have max memory. Would appreciate some knowledgeable input...   <answer193451> Crucial, UK state that 4GB is the maximum amount of RAM that your iMac officially supports.   If you put more in and it worked then this could be seen as a 'bug', and wouldn't be supported by Apple. Such abilities could also be revoked through software/firm was updates.   <answer193452> according to Mactracker the mid 2007 imac 20inch has: Maximum Memory  6.0 GB (Actual) 4.0 GB (Apple) Memory Slots    2 - 200-pin PC2-5300 (667MHz) DDR2 SO-DIMM  you should also make sure that you always have the same amount on both slots in your case two 3gb however 3gb rams are rare therefore more expensive  <answer269333> In another forum some users have confirmed 2007 iMac works with 8 GB with no issue after the el Captain upgrade.    <comment230602> true and not true, mine has max 4gb supported by apple 8gb actual. i upgraded ram around 6 years ago and I've not had any issues and the system makes use of all <comment230647> Iâ€™m failing to see what part of what I said could be seen as not true  <comment230651> i meant that the 4gb is not the maximum... which is just what you said. i missed that... my mistake  i simply ment that the mac he has apparently supports more than that! <comment230652> Are you saying you have a iMac (20-inch, Mid 2007) with two 4 GB 667 MHz DD2 SDRAM memory modules and OS X reports your total memory is 8 GB? <comment230697> no i have a later model, what i am saying is that the max set by apple is not neccerly the real maximum the computer supports. and according to mactracker the 20 inch mid 2007 supports 6gb <comment338326> Welcome to Ask Different.
