screenshots storage place back to desktop impossible <body> I previously changed the settings of which folder to save screenshots.  Now I want to go back to the default settings, storing it on the desktop.  I have read what to do, in emTerminal/em enter:codedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Desktop//code then codekillall SystemUIServer/code.  However, even after restarting the laptop, when I make a screenshot or a partial screenshot, I hear the sound of the shot but it doesn't appear on my desktop (or anywhere else).  How can I get the screenshots to appear in the default folder?  <answer242986> The problem is that the command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Desktop/ /code/pre  will set the default location for screenshots to be code/Desktop//code. What you actually want is to set it to be code/Users/yourusername/Desktop//code.  Try this, replacing codeyourusername/code with the username for your account:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location /Users/yourusername/Desktop/ /code/pre  <answer242989> If you want it back to the default setting, then in a Terminal run the following commands:  precodedefaults delete com.apple.screencapture location killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  The emdefault location/em is the User's Desktop and does not require the codelocation/code emkey/em to be set in the codecom.apple.screencapture.plist/code file, hence the codelocation/code emkey/em is just deleted as it only exists when the emdefault/em has been modified.  Then for the change to take effect, codekillall SystemUIServer/code does that.  Note: When a User Account is first created the code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist/code file does not exist and is only created if one modifies the emdefault/em settings for screen captures.  As an example, changing the storage emlocation/em of the screen shots, whether or not you want the emdrop shadow/em included and or the emfile type/em.  As an example I use the default emlocation/em and emfile type/em but do not want the emdrop shadow/em, so the output of my codecom.apple.screencapture.plist/code file is:  precode$ defaults read com.apple.screencapture {     "disable-shadow" = 1; } /code/pre  If you do not have any setting changes other then the emstorage location/em and you want to truly revert to the default, then just delete the code.plist/code file.  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  These command can be combined on the command line by separating them with a semi-colon code;/code.  precoderm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.screencapture.plist ; killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <answer287549> Open the plist file in Xcode and remove the codelocation/code key entirely. This can also be accomplished in Terminal with the command  codedefaults delete com.apple.screencapture location; killall SystemUIServer/code  Alternatively, you can just trash the plist file and make any needed modifications again.  <comment299344> thanks for all the help, since both commentaries made sense, and I tried the both of them, something else seems the problem... I guess that although I hear the sound of the snap, there is actually no screenshot taken. I have had installed a new hard disk, and since it is practically empty I am quite sure now the screenshot is saved nowhere... if you have any advice on this, that would be great!
