OSX Yosemite periodically loses DNS info for my server <body> I'm running OSX Yosemite as my development machine. I run a VPS for the product I'm developing at cursiveclojure.com. Every so often (3 times now over the last month or so) my Mac somehow gets into a state where it can't resolve that domain, even though it seems to work from elsewhere and the server is available. So right now:  precode~/d/riddley (master)&gt; ping cursiveclojure.com ping: cannot resolve cursiveclojure.com: Unknown host ~/d/riddley (master)&gt; dig cursiveclojure.com  ANY +noall +answer ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; cursiveclojure.com ANY +noall +answer ;; global options: +cmd cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  MX  10 cursiveclojure.com. cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  A   95.170.82.135 cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  TXT "v=spf1 a mx ip4:95.170.82.135 ip6:2a01:7c8:aab0:51f::1 -all" cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  NS  rush.easydns.com. cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  NS  nirvana.easydns.net. cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  NS  motorhead.easydns.org. cursiveclojure.com. 10799   IN  SOA dns1.easydns.com. zone3.easydns.com. 1411422284 43200 10800 1209600 10800 ~/d/riddley (master)&gt; ping 95.170.82.135 PING 95.170.82.135 (95.170.82.135): 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 95.170.82.135: icmp_seq=0 ttl=48 time=300.551 ms /code/pre  A friend has confirmed that the site works fine from elsewhere. The only solution I have found is to restart my machine, flushing the DNS caches with codesudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches/code doesn't seem to help.  Does anyone know what's going on?  <answer167495> From time to time I have the same problem - specially with my own MX server. More or less default DNS setup for this DNS entry.  Restart helps, but strongdisconnecting and reconnecting the network cable works/strong too. You could also try to change your network location.  Every of these emsolutions/em suck, I know. But it's ATM the fastest one before figuring out the real problem (one of the thousands other problems that came with Yosemite).
