Delayed, undesirable sleep on de-powering MBP retina with ML <body> If my laptop is sitting with the screen open, live, and plugged in, and I unplug it and keep working, a moment later it will go to sleep. Even as I am typing at it.   The only solution is to close the cover, count to five, and reopen.  Is there a real solution?  I asked pmget for some log and got the following:  I've got 10.8.2 on here.  precode11/16/12 6:57:50 AM EST  Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:100%)                           1809 secs  11/16/12 7:28:26 AM EST  Sleep                  Maintenance Sleep Sleep: Using AC (Charge:100%)                             9 secs     11/16/12 12:44:31 PM EST Sleep                  Clamshell Sleep Sleep: Using BATT (Charge:100%)                             7 secs   /code/pre  <comment83360> It might be worth running a command like `pmset -g log | grep -E '^.{24} Sleep '` in Terminal to hopefully see what the sleep cause was.
