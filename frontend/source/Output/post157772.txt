sudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 501, should be 0 <body> To run programs as sudo without password, I edited /etc/sudoers with wrong content.   Then I re-edited it with Mac's default text editor(course sudo cannot be used when /etc/sudoers is wrong).  I tried to run sudo agin, and get this error:   precodesudo: /etc/sudoers is owned by uid 501, should be 0 sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting /code/pre  What should I do? I cannot remember the root password (maybe I haven't ever set root password before).  <answer157775> You can boot into single user mode by pressing kbdCmd-S/kbd on startup (see OS X: How to start up in single-user or verbose mode for details) which should give you a root shell. Then run  precodemount -uw / chown root:wheel /etc/sudoers chmod 440 /etc/sudoers reboot /code/pre  to fix the problem and restart.  <answer157784> ol liOpen codeDirectory Utility/code (/System/Library/CoreServices/)./li liClick the lock icon to unlock it, then enter your administrator name and password./li liDo one of the following:    ul liChoose Edit  Enable Root User, then enter a root user password in the Password and Verify fields./li liChoose Edit  Change Root Password, then enter a new root user password.

To restore this use Disk Utility.app.br Select the boot volume (by default called Macintosh HD) on the left hand side.br Click the Verify or Repair Disk Permissions - the latter will reapply the stored permissions.  To edit sudoers in the future I would use visudo which checks that the edit is valid  re the root password you probably have not set it before - the idea of sudo is that you never need to use it and Apple disables root login by default  <comment185522> would there any possible try without restart? I have some usable program running now. <comment185526> Seems it doesn't work. The console <comment185528> Dose Disk Utilities repair permissions work? <comment185529> @Mark how to do that? I'm using Chinese version. <comment185530> @Mark It works, but got syntax error now. <comment185531> I repaired the error in sudoers file, then repaired the permissions agin. it's alright now. Thanks a lot @Mark <comment185532> @Mark Answer my question, and I will choose you as the accepted one. <comment263524> A genuine life-saver! Thank you so much! <comment281806> If you find that you can't edit the file through the command line, open it using a GUI application like TextEdit. That will bypass the corrupt sudo configuration. <comment281863> If you get  `Read-only file system`, do `mount -o update /` first <comment281865> @Sridhar-Sarnobat see updated answer, thanks for pointing this out <comment281876> Just to save others some of the time I wasted fooling around with the sudoers file, The permissions MUST be `440`, and the owners MUST be `root:wheel`. Anything else will cause sudo to fail. Don't try and get clever with symbolic links! `-r--r----- 1 root wheel ` <comment333737> there is no such thing on `sierra` anymore <comment333751> worked, I 3 u @patrix. This the only one that worked for me, I'm on `Sierra` all other things in all sites didn't worked for me. <comment357160> That doesn't work with OS X El Capitan
