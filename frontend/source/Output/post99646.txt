With a readable and writable encrypted disk image, you can treat it as a normal folder and copy, delete, or move files from the image. Anything brought into the image while mounted will become encrypted automatically under the same protective layer with the same password. When you are finished working with the folder and want it password protected again, simply unmount the disk image. Regaining access again will require the password before it can be mounted and available.   h23rd Party Apps/Snow Leopard Compatible/h2  ol liKnox- Create as many encrypted vaults as you want, each with separate passwords.
