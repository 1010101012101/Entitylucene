Best way to push contact groups to different iPhones <body> I work for a large organization, and we've just bought iPhones for about 500 employees. The employees receiving the phones work in different locations, and we want the workers in a certain location to only have contacts of the other employee at that location. I.e., an employee that works at x will only have phone contacts of employees working at x who are receiving phones. There are about 20 different groups.   Basically, I want to set up some kind of server that can push contact groups to certain phones. What would be the best way to do this?  Additional info: The phones will be managed (MobileIron) and set up with the company's email (Exchange). We've already considered syncing the contacts with the email, but there's no guarantee that the new phone information will make it into everyone's account.    <comment317652> It's relatively easy to do with exchange, just create a resource mailbox for each contact group (much like you might for a resource or room) and populate it with contacts.  You can add multiple exchange accounts to an iPhone, just make thar account for contacts only (or maybe even contacts and a calendar that is shared).  Be sure to educate everyone about multiple contact groups on their phones and how the control works (I.e opening contacts and clicking groups in the top left) as most people don't have multiple contact groups.  Also don't forget you can use the Exchange Global Address list.
