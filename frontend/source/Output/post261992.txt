How does the lighting cable work plugged in any way round? <body> Sorry titled this one badly, I'm assuming power is the two centre pins, then data is the rest, but surely it's messed up when the cable is plugged in backwards?  <answer261993> Per this site:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPaVe.gif" alt="enter image description here"     Apple Lightning interface is adaptive - the controller chip dynamically assign pins function according to plugged device.      The Apple Lightning connector plug can be inserted with either side   facing up (the processor inside the plug detects the plug's   orientation and routes the electrical signals to the correct pins).Two   differential pair lanes (L0p/n and L1p/n) may swap in IC of device   connector (lanes don't swap if accessory identification chip connect   to ID0 pin).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Roazl.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer262016> From: Systems Analysis of the Apple Lightning to USB Cable      The BQ2025’s one data pin is connected to two Lightning cable pins.   Why two? Recall that the Lightning cable is designed to work no matter   which way it is inserted into the phone (USB anyone?). Some may call   it lazy to not have to think when plugging something in, but we feel   that it is a subtle improvement in usability that shows attention to   detail.      The figure below shows the Lightning cable in two orientations   (there’s a little white triangle on the diagram to help you visualize   the rotation). The coloured lines indicate electrically equivalent   pins. We know from our circuit board analysis that the BQ2025 connects   to the black signal. Effectively then, the BQ2025 is connected to two   Lightning cable pins. We’ve labelled them A1 and B5.      The phone itself only monitors the bottom row of pins. If the user has   inserted the cable right-side-up, the phone needs to use the pin,   which is fifth from the left, to communicate with the BQ2025. That’s   where the black signal is. Furthermore, if the user has inserted the   cable upside-down (or is it right-side-up?), the phone needs to use   the left-most pin. The BQ2025’s one data pin is connected to two   Lightning cable pins. Why two? Recall that the Lightning cable is   designed to work no matter which way it is inserted into the phone   (USB anyone?). Some may call it lazy to not have to think when   plugging something in, but we feel that it is a subtle improvement in   usability that shows attention to detail.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aek8F.jpg" alt="From: https://www.chipworks.com/sites/default/files/wpblog/2pin-config-4.jpg"  <comment328155> See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_(connector)?wprov=sfsi1 <comment328362> Would that explain the chip in the lighting cable? <comment328365> Yes, in addition to security and authentication capabilities.
