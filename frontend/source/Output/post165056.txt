Change IAP Display Name <body> Is there any way to change an In App Purchase display name after you've created the IAP?  I see the option to change other items, just not that... am I missing something?  Thanks!  This is referring to the Display Name in iTunes Connect when you add an IAP item.   <answer165174> Even though it looks like you can't, just double click Display Name to edit  <comment193600> Could you please improve your question by adding a bit more context to it. As it is now it is pretty hard to guess what are you asking exactly I think.
