How to make the "Search with Google" menu option open up in a new tab by default in Safari? <body> I know I can kbdCommand/kbd-click it to achieve that. What I want is to change the default behavior from opening in the same tab to opening in a new tab.  Is there an extension or a hidden configuration for that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0bcRa.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer23372> In this article Jonathan Rentzsch creates a new service because he wants "Search with Google" to work in Chrome (his default browser) but a side benefit of following his tutorial is that your search should open in a new tab.   If your default browser is Safari it should open your new tab there.  http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/5794765921/search-with-google-using-chrome  Warning: This is essentially a follow directions, cut-and-paste affair but it does involve seeing code. I'm unaware of a easy to install extension to accomplish this same task.  <comment26096> This worked fine. The newly created option appears on the bottom of the context menu though, I wish it appeared on the top.
