Blank process name in Activity Monitor on OS X Mavericks <body> In my activity monitor I have noticed that there is a process appearing that has no name. It is owned by root.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dKMQF.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I find out what this process is?  <answer124455> Try clicking the "info" button and then running a sample on the process. For me, the process turned out to by iStatLocalDaemon.  <answer137021> I usually have process like this on my "Activity Monitor" too, and there is no additional information related to it when I push the "Info" button.  First I get the PID showed at the "Activity Monitor", in your example, is      31602   In my case, it was the code725/code PID.  I went to the "Terminal" and looked up for that PID manually, using codeps/code command:  precodeps -ea | grep 725 /code/pre  The result was:  precode  725 ??         0:00.13 com.apple.activititymonitor.helper /code/pre  Now I have an idea about what the process without name is :)  I hope this can resolves your doubts.  Best Regards.
