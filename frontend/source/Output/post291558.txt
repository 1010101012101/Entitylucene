Cannot unmount external HDD. Only "force unmount" works <body> I cannot use the Finder on my external HDD icon - unmount. It doesn't work, only force unmount.  I think if I force it, some files can be damaged.  I have closed all programs running on it. With codesudo lsof|grep ExternalHddName/code I wanted to find out the processes using this HDD. Nothing was shown.  strong1. Should I avoid force unmount every time?/strong In meaning of whether id dangerous.  emUpdate/em  codesudo lsof|grep /Volumes/ExternalHddName/code should be used instead.  If I use codediskutil unmount /Volumes/ExternalHddName/code I become codefailed to unmount: dissented by PID=199 (/usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw/code  Im using the online game on the external HDD. Maybe this codesocketfilterw/code has something to do with it. But its active even 20 minutes after I have exit this game.  I have used codesudo kill 199/code, after it unmount was possible.  strong2. Should I every time I want to unmount this external HDD manually find which process use it and than manually kill this process?/strong I would like to do it in one step and without logout from Mac.  <answer292735> Some online games have "helper apps" that update the game in the background. Try plugging in the drive and then unmount it strongwithout/strong running the game. If it does work, then you could make a simple Automator/bash script to unmount the drive (it should consist of the two commands you mentioned above, except that you should use codesudo killall &lt;appname&gt;/code for killing the process locking the drive.  <answer292799> Try to disable firewall? From your post looks like it is a firewall process.  <comment369424> Could you expand your answer with *how* to disable the firewall? <comment369444> Without the game was started I can unmount this HDD. <comment369445> Should I write `sudo killall nameOfTheGame`? Could you show the complete script you mean please? <comment369446> If I force unmount - can I become some problems for my HDD? Not for unsaved text files etc. <comment373632> @MikroDel yes, 'killall nameofthegame' should work
