Add SD card to Fusion Drive in MacBook Pro 12,1 <body> I want to know if it's possible to add a 128 GB SD card to my MacBook Pro 12,1 (13-inch Retina, early 2015) and make 250 GB Fusion drive.  precode$ sudo diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +120.5 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  D3021BC9-8BCA-40BA-9B7C-07F28BDE678B                                  Unencrypted /dev/disk2 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *129.8 GB   disk1    1:                  Apple_HFS Transcend               129.8 GB   disk2s1 /code/pre    precode$ sudo diskutil cs list  CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)  Logical Volume Group 878F63CA-69DB-43F2-8708-271D776049F5  =========================================================      Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         120473067520 B (120.5 GB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 0303DA39-F711-42D5-AB0B-7C35015763B3     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     120473067520 B (120.5 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family EA26D69A-ED32-4088-BBF5-DD4ED4A01FE2         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Conversion Status:       Complete         Reversion State:         Reverting         High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure         |                        Has Visible Users         |                        Has Volume Key         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume D3021BC9-8BCA-40BA-9B7C-07F28BDE678B             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk1             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          120473067520 B (120.5 GB)             Conversion Progress:   Complete             Revertible:            No             Revert Status:         PV to LV passthrough mode             LV Name:               Macintosh HD             Volume Name:           Macintosh HD             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Following an iBook from Carlos Burgues &amp; Pablo Romeu called "Fusion Drive, Crea tu propia unidad Fusion drive en tu Mac" I think the commands would be:  precodesudo diskutil cs addDisk 878F63CA-69DB-43F2-8708-271D776049F5 disk2s1 diskutil cs resizevolume D3021BC9-8BCA-40BA-9B7C-07F28BDE678B 249,8g /code/pre  But I'm not sure how to make it work properly and I have some questions about the process:  ul liCan I make changes directly on disk, or I must boot from another source to add the 128 GB SD card?/li liIs it better to restore a carbon copy (or Time Machine) to a new &amp; formatted 250gb Fusion drive?/li liWill I loose the Recovery HD?/li liIs there a better way to do this? (something like tardisk Pear software)/li /ul  I really appreciate you to try to help me, but please, really, don't answer with something like: Don't do it (SD cards are no reliable, bad speeds, etc), or buy a better laptop, or something similar. The HDD can't be upgraded, so I want to try this solution.  <answer273177> I have a 128GB SSD SD card installed on my MacBook Pro 12,1. The only reason it can't be done is because the 2 drives do not boot up at the same time and you cannot boot to the SD card. I don't know why apple did this, but if they didn't I could show you how to do it in disk utilities and not through terminal.  <answer273180> You need to create a RAID 0 Striped Array. Here is how to do it: https://www.lifewire.com/use-disk-utility-to-create-a-raid-0-striped-array-2260918  <comment268308> Give up now. Really. SD cards are nowhere *near* reliable enough to do this, even if you can find a way to force it. <comment268309> Please don't try to reformat Terminal output. I've attempted to format it correctly but feel free to edit further. <comment268452> After your edit - I get through literally thousands of SD cards for work. I wouldn't trust one to hold **any** data that was not simply a copy of a master held elsewhere. The fail-rate on SDs is alarming. If you have one in effect 'RAIDed' to your internal drive, then at the first hint of a fail, you've lost the entire thing, not just the SD half. <comment343404> Welcome to Ask Different!
