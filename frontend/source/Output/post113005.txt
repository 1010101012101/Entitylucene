Can I make GIMP work as a MacOS X Service? <body> I would like to be able to use GIMP as a MacOS X Service. That is, I want to be able to select an image in a document, choose Services-Edit Image in GIMP, bring the image into GIMP, make changes, save it out, and have the image updated.  The Services menu worked really well in NeXTSTEP but most MacOS X users have no clue what it is for. It would be nice to be able to start using it again.  <answer113041> You could create a service like this with Automator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bST6t.png" alt=""  It can't be used to for example edit an image embedded in a Pages document though.  <comment132714> Can automater make a service that will wait for the file to be edited and then return it? Hm. It might not be that hard to code something up that does what I just described.
