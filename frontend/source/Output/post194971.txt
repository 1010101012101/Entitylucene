Applescript to emulate key strokes <body> I want applescript to input into microsoft excel "No, (tab, tab again), Yes". I can't seem to make this work. I would preferably like it to start whenever I press a hotkey or something, but having to swipe over and activate the script should be ok.  Thanks, Nick  <answer194982> There is a lot of information about how to write Applescript code in general and how to use it to send keystrokes available on the net. System Events, Key Code and Keystroke looks kind of interesting in your case and should get you started.  <comment232700> Can you add the script you already have? <comment232701> @patrix thx for the quick reply, I don't have anything so far, but I have been trying things like "tell application Excel, keystroke "No" to no avail. I am really not talented at things like this so I would be grateful if you could even write a script for me! Thanks, Nick <comment232703> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36943/how-do-i-automate-a-key-press-in-applescript <comment232940> Thanks @patrix, I got the script working! Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
