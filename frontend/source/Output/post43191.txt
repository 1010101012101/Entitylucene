Define order of label color in Finder <body> I have ordered labeled PDF files with the colors green (very good), orange (ok) and red (bad). When I order my files after labels I get:  ul liGreen/li liOrange/li liYellow/li /ul  But I want to have  ul liGreen/li liYellow/li liOrange/li /ul  Is it possible to configure finder to order labels in my preferred way?  <answer43193> h2No./h2  The ordering after colors is alphabetical. The order you want is 'random' and this is not supported by default.  <answer43258> You can change the label names in Finder preferences so they'll be sorted how you'd like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V89mQ.png" alt="Finder Label Preferences"  With label names changed, they now sort like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cTujF.png" alt="Finder Window with Custom Label Sort Order"
