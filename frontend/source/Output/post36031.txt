External accessory framework test hardware <body> I need to write an app for a client the uses the ExternalAccessory framework to communicate with some hardware, I read in 'External Accessory Programming Exercises' by Norman McEntire that the Simulator includes 2 test accessories, however when I run the EADemo sample app from Apple on the Simulator it says there are no accessories connected.  Does anyone know how I can simulate an accessory so I can learn the framework, or is there an inexpensive piece of hardware I can use to learn with. Thanks in advance!
