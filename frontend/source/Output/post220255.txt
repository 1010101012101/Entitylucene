Disable HTML5 video auto-play in OS X Safari? <body> I want to disable videos in Safari, as I have to pay for each byte downloaded.  Some videos I may want to watch, but emI/em want to decide whether I use my precious bandwidth, rather than have it automatically play.  Is there any way to accomplish this?  <answer220268> It appears to currently not be possible to do this in Safari. While a plugin could exist to do this, I'm currently unaware of any.   This article does a good job summarizing the other options you have (other browsers). Of the list, I'd choose Firefox as it supports what you're looking for natively, though there are extensions/plugins for Chrome and Opera.   It may also be important to note that these only look for the code&lt;video&gt;/code and code&lt;audio&gt;/code tags. Other forms of media (big gifs, Java extensions etc.) which consume significant bandwidth may be able to slip through.   <answer261592> I have had a little (but not enough) luck adding the following to my /etc/hosts file:  precode## Autoplay videos 127.0.0.1  vp.nyt.com 127.0.0.1  nythlslive-i.akamaihd.net 127.0.0.1  ondemand.abcnews.com 127.0.0.1  newsy-limelightovp3.creatorcloud.netdna-cdn.com 127.0.0.1  player.hearstdigitalstudios.com 127.0.0.1  c.brightcove.com #Independent /code/pre  <answer265914> This seems to work for me (macOS Sierra 10.12.2, Safari 10.0.2), courtesy of jeffreyv in an Apple Support thread:  In the Terminal, enter:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeInternalDebugMenu 1 /code/pre  That enables the Debug menu in Safari.

Thanks! <comment266590> I'm not sure there's a way to do that yet. I would install flash and then install click to flash. Then you can choose when to enable the video. It sounds like a good candidate for a plugin. The plugin would block all video tags. <comment267982> Thanks for the link, @agentroadkill.  Unfortunately, none of these will help my problem of anemic data allotment.  From the referenced link:  "Disabling automatic playback just pauses the video; it doesn’t prevent it from loading. ... In other words, if you’d like to use this trick to save bandwidth, it won’t help much." <comment315931> For older versions of Safari, try ClickToPlugIn (by the maker of ClickToFlash) -- it would block the HTML5 player until you clicked on the player.  Alas, Safari 10 seems to have broken that ClickToPlugIn capability. <comment333479> I had high hopes for this @Fab.  I tested it out on Youtube.  After changing the setting, the video still downloaded into the buffer.  I also could not manually start it :-( <comment333665> @PaulWaldo - oh :-(  Try some of the other settings, such as "Disallow Inline Video"? Really a bit pathetic that there's not a simple setting or even extension to turn off these damn things....
