App Store: You have not yet purchased any apps <body> This morning I had the same Issue as in this thread. I had 7 Updates, but the "Updates" tab was empty. The "solution" seemed to be updating on the "Purchased" tab.  But my tab says, that I haven't purchased any apps yet.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f0vsB.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am logged in....  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCO8e.png" alt="enter image description here"  I moved from Germany to America. But I have downloaded several Updates for Xcode in Germany, as well as in America.   I have changed my "Country and Region" to the States. And emI just have tried to change it back/em. The tab stays empty.  I want to update to Xcode 8.1  Now I'm downloading Xcode as if it would be a complete new app. It asked me to "get" instead of "update" Xcode...  Even tho I have it installed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W70Vr.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried to switch back to the German Store by changing back my "Country and Region". And I have restarted my MacBook 100 times. Also, I only use this one AppID.  First Xcode download was in Germany a year ago. But update to macOS Sierra, what also brought me Xcode 8 was with this Account and with the US App Store... So it should not be a matter of Country/Region...  PS: The updates issue is gone since I have activated Auto Update.. I have no pending updates anymore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/61cWk.png" alt="enter image description here"  But Xcode is still in Version 8.0 and I'm able to "download" (get) Xcode 8.1 from the store.  <answer259067> The App Store is having problems since yesterday afternoon. It is not your fault, it is a problem on their end. So we just have to wait it out.  <answer259077> I had the same issue.  I found an answer that got me some help: "there is a commandline app called softwareupdate that you have to run as root.  sudo softwareupdate --list for example will give you the list of apps that are set to update. You can then run sudo softwareupdate --install {app-name}  This won't let you install a new application that you haven't already downloaded though.  shareedit answered Nov 20 '12 at 20:08  Mark Cohen 63646" Using Mark Cohen's suggestion, I updated iTunes by command line and today my App Store App is up to date.    <comment323987> I CAN SEE YOUR APPLE ID ACCOUNT THROUGH THE RED MARKER. <comment323988> @Bradman175 updated. thanks for the hint mate <comment323989> (I've seen this happen in many situations...) <comment323993> okay. good to know. thanks buddy <comment324019> The App Store is back now. <comment324081> I ran softwareupdate at terminal, but it only installed itunes and sierra update. not the xcode one ... <comment324083> well. i have finished downloading the "new app xcode"... but still my purchased tab says I havent downloaded anything. even THO i just said: I have finished downloading xcode (with "get") <comment324084> and yes, i have restarted my macbook
