App for custom Gmail push notifications <body> Does anyone know of an app that can notify me of new emails in my Gmail in specific time intervals? I mean, I want to set up hour intervals when it is ok to receive notifications.  I have researched a lot and seen apps like pushmail, where you need to forward to another email address, but I wan't something that does not need my mails to be forwarded.  The app will need:  ul liGmail IMAP connection/li liNotifications on new mail/li liQuiet periods (or else OK-to-notify periods)/li liCustom notification sounds/li liNice UI ;)/li /ul  <answer35706> Except for your requirement of setting quiet-times, one possible option would be Google Notifier.  Perhaps you could have a cron process that starts and stops Google Notifier at specific times?  <comment40651> I use [Growl](http://growl.info/screenshots). It does not have all the features you request, but it is supported by many well-known applications: mail.app, cyberduck, dropbox, twitter, transmission.... <comment40654> Can you use Mail? Turn off Push notifications and enable fetch, you can then set to fetch every hour, or manually (when you open mail app)
