Is there a way to see which contacts are "VIPs" outside of Mail.app? <body> Obviously, with Mountain Lion, users may define VIPs in Apple’s Mail.app. I would like to see which contacts are marked as VIPs outside of Mail – for example in Contacts.app (smart list??), or in Terminal. Is there a way to do so?  <answer65171> Seems to be listed here.  ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist  precodedefaults read ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist Senders /code/pre  I only know how to narrow it down to the nested names in applescript. But you can use the applescript from terminal.  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e "tell app \"System Events\" to (get value of property list item \"Name\" of property list items of property list item \"Senders\" of property list file  \"~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/VIPSenders.plist\") " /code/pre  <comment76637> Very nice! This will do. If anyone knows how to directly read the nested values from the plist file: you are welcome!
