Blank iOS 6 iTunes backup <body> I am developing an application for which I need an strongiTunes backup/strong of an strongiPhone running iOS 6/strong. This iPhone should not contain any data and the iTunes backup needs to be taken after performing strongfactory reset/strong.  Are there any resources which provides this type of data?  Iâ€™d appreciate any suggestions on this topic. Thank you in advance.  <comment314783> Welcome to the community Nimesh. Can you share what you need to be able to do with the iTunes backup? Just asking in case there are other options the community may come up with that will serve the same purpose. <comment314784> Oh, and does it have to be an iPhone backup? What about one from an iPod or iPad running iOS 6? <comment314789> Yes it needs to be an iPhone backup as I am dealing with messages in my application. <comment314802> That's ashame. I'm pretty sure I can get one based on an iPod (it does still have the messages app, after all). Not sure about one based on an iPhone (at least not one immediately following a reset).
