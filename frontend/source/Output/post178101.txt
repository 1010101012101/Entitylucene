Mail app issue with gmail <body> I have a very frustrating issue with mail app. I am using the mail app for my gmail email address.  The issue is that, when I am writing a new message and would like to save a draft, the app creates a NEW draft for each time I press kbdcmd/kbd+kbdS/kbd to save the draft state. So, by the time I finish writing the email, I can see 20+ new drafts all sourced from the single message.  I experience this only with mail app. I used another apps, and all did not have this issue.  I am running osx yosemite.  <answer179010> Don't save drafts !!! Drafts are auto saved by OS.
