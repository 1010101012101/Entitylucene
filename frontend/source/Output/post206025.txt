USB tethering gone after upgrading to iOS 9 and iTunes 12.3 <body> After upgrading my iPhone 6 to iOS 9, and iTunes to 12.3, I cannot use the Personal Hotspot via USB anymore. It worked fine until the updates.  Through WiFi it works fine, so the cause is not that Personal Hotspot wasn't turned on, or that the Cellular Data Network settings weren't correct. Also, after I plug in the USB, the device does show up in iTunes, and Image Capture sees it too.  So, Personal Hotspot works and USB works, but the two not together.  This is what the Network preferences show on OS X (Yosemite 10.10.5): "Either the cable for iPhone USB is not plugged in or the device is not responding."  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h5N15.png" alt="OS X Network preferences"  And here is a screenshot from the iPhone's Personal Hotspot. The blue badge shows I'm successfully connected via WiFi:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U10JX.png" alt="iPhone Personal Hotspot settings"  Also, it seems I'm not alone. Any pointers on how to fix it?  <answer206037> h3Update:/h3  Per @SeeMeCode's answer, you can re-install iTunes to solve the problem.   hr  Solved.  I found the solution here. It's caused by a damaged kernel extension code/System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext/code.  When I check code/var/log/system.log/code, sure enough there is:  precodeSep 17 08:00:58 wagner.local com.apple.kextd[45]: Kext id com.apple.driver.AppleUSBHostMergeProperties not found; removing personalities from kernel. Sep 17 08:00:58 wagner.local com.apple.kextd[45]: ERROR: invalid signature for com.apple.macos.driver.AppleUSBEthernetHost, will not load /code/pre  This extension is installed with iTunes, so the cause was update to iTunes 12.3, not iOS 9. I tried to download iTunes and reinstall it, but it just installed the same damaged version of the kernel extension. So instead, I replaced it from a Time Machine backup as both the currently installed and the backed up version had the same version number 7.0.  After a restart, USB tethering works again.  To distinguish between the two, here's what the working one looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MjoiY.png" alt="working kext"  precode$ ls -lR /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext total 0 drwxr-xr-x  6 root  wheel  204 Jan 10  2015 Contents  /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext/Contents: total 16 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  3202 Jan 10  2015 Info.plist drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel   102 Jan 10  2015 MacOS drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel   102 Jan 10  2015 _CodeSignature -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel   474 Jan 10  2015 version.plist  /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext/Contents/MacOS: total 128 -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  63024 Jan 10  2015 AppleUSBEthernetHost  /System/Library/Extensions/AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext/Contents/_CodeSignature: total 8 -rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  3668 Jan 10  2015 CodeResources /code/pre  And the damaged one:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lq33l.png" alt="damaged kext"  precode$ ls -lR AppleUSBEthernetHost.kext total 0 drwxr-xr-x  5 ischeini  staff  170 Aug  5 00:30 Contents  Contents: total 16 -rw-r--r--@ 1 ischeini  staff  3202 Aug  5 00:30 Info.plist drwxr-xr-x  3 ischeini  staff   102 Aug  5 00:30 MacOS -rw-r--r--@ 1 ischeini  staff   473 Aug  5 00:30 version.plist  Contents/MacOS: total 144 -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 ischeini  staff  71792 Aug  5 00:30 AppleUSBEthernetHost /code/pre  <answer206480> Looks like Apple may have published a new build of iTunes 12.3 with the old version of the kext file per a comment here from earlier today.  Tried it and confirmed the issue is resolved.  PS: If you want to check, the MD5 checksum of the new version is 77bad7ebb366433672169d40c5659224.  <answer211095> This required even further action for me. There was a checkbox to disable USB tethering.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rvHAE.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment248408> Have you tried removing "iPhone USB" in the Network list of your Mac and reconnecting your iPhone so that your Mac will detect it as a new device? <comment248531> Since I did not have any backups, I had to run `sudo nvram boot-args="kext-dev-mode=1"` and restart in order to allow for the new kext to be loaded. <comment248616> @Stoinov, so the only problem with the new one is just that it's not signed? <comment248622> According to my system log - yes. Or maybe that the signature is wrong. <comment248948> Can confirm. Only change to my system was iTunes 12.3, and USB tethering stopped working. <comment248949> Can confirm the new build of iTunes 12.3 fixes it (just go to http://apple.com/itunes/download) (thanks to @SeeMeCode's answer). <comment250081> I have the same problem; it didn't show up in the list. <comment252462> Are you saying that the newest iTunes will or will not fix this issue? Thanks. I'm running 12.2.25 <comment253474> Yes the solution is weird but works! I already have 12.3.0.44 installed but still downloaded followed the solution and it worked. Thanks! <comment253815> MD5 (itunes12.3~corrupted.dmg) = 1541add0f747fcf9e5b30993f8929091, MD5 (itunes12.3.dmg) = 77bad7ebb366433672169d40c5659224 <comment254437> This worked for me.  Download new iTunes 12.3, verify MD5, install. Then unplug iphone, replug-in iPhone, tethering works.
