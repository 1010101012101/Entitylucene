Google Drive no longer opens .mid files <body> My in-law's iPad Mini 582DC/A is running iOS 9.3.5 and Google Drive 4.13. Drive is apparently a recent update.  She has access to a shared Drive filled with MIDI (.mid) files, which previously opened in Sweet MIDI simply by clicking on then. Now Drive says "Unable to Open File", and presents an "Open In" button. The Open In displays another button called "open in", but clicking that returns "you do not have any apps installed that can open this item".  Attempting to fix this, I downloaded MIDI Opener. This offers direct access to Drive, but when I navigate to the same file, it is greyed out, I cannot select it.  So it seems that the link between .mid files and our MIDI players, there are two, is broken. I cannot be sure if this is broken on Drive or in iOS itself.  Any suggestions?
