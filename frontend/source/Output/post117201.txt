Copy + pasting arabic text on English Mac <body> I'm having a hard time pasting a piece of arabic text into a web form. I have a rMBP 2013 bought from the US and a translator sent me some block of text to enter into a webform. The problem is that the text contains a percentage discount which is written with Latin languages.  This is how the original text looks like (screenshot from codeSublime Text 2/code):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bb18u.png" alt="this is how the arabic text should look like"  This is the how the piece of text gets pasted into a textarea inside my Browser (Chrome version 31):  precodeشهر الحقائب - خصم 70% /code/pre  The problem is that even if I just copy only the arabic part of that text and try to manually type 70%, the code70/code is added to the left of the arabic text and the code%/code is added to the right. How can this be? Is there a workaround I can do to get this text properly pasted into a web form? I tried setting my Mac's language to Arabic, but still no luck...  <comment136974> Try Firefox and other web browsers.
