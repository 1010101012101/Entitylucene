How to analyse an iOS 8.2 Messages misbehaviour? <body> h2Bug description/h2  In iOS 8.2 I just discovered a misbehaviour of codeMessages/code application within the function to delete SMS.  When a given discussion is opened, I want to select and delete a set of SMS. To achieve this I usually long-tap on one SMS to make the codeCopy | More…/code menu appear, and choose codeMore…/code. Then the current SMS is automatically selected and the bottom changes to a menu with a blue trash on the left and a blue arrow on the right.  Actually this function is unreachable. When I long-tap on one SMS the hidden codeCopy | More…/code menu appears:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QjmJI.png" alt="iOS 8.2 Messages 1"  but the bottom does not change. The function to delete a message or a set of messages is not there:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqNnD.png" alt="iOS 8.2 Messages 2"  I compared the codeMessages/code settings with one running iOS 7.1.2 wich doesn't present this problem. They have exactly the same configuration.  h2Workaround for the dummies/h2  If I quit the codeMessages/code application, the bug vanishes… temporarily.  h2Question/h2  Is this a known problem?  Might this be a configuration error I made and which I didn't see?  Might this be a bug?  How may I diagnose this for sure?  <comment219181> Top menu is changing correctly, just not the bottom… I'd do the usual suspects… force-quit app; reboot; iTunes sync/backup/restore - which may insist on updating to 8.3, not certain on that. If you look carefully at the 2nd image, the bottom part of the screen has a double line, the first [correct] image doesn't. Looks like a screen refresh bug of some sort. [Late thought] do you have any non-Apple keyboards? <comment219184> Eagle's eye :)! I didn't notice the double line.↵I agree with your fast amnalysis: this looks like a refresh pb.. But moreover I would like to understand first.↵I don't have any non-Apple keyboard. <comment219186> I'd be tempted to call "glitch" but as I know of no way to poke around in the machinations of an iPhone to test how/why, I'd just plod through the varying degrees of 'reset' <comment219247> (Side note: backup/restore will force an update to 8.3, yes, since Apple has stopped signing 8.2.) <comment219259> → tubedogg: thank you for the improvment with the *long-tap* neologism I ignored :). <comment219383> @tubedogg - thanks for the confirmation. I don't have any devices not on 8.3 so no way to even test. @ danielAzuelos - let us know how it goes :)
