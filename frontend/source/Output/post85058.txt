Equivalent to Alt + dot on terminal <body> On linux consoles I always use kbdAlt/kbd + kbd./kbd to get the last argument of the previous command in history.  for example if I had  precodels /tmp/test /code/pre  as last command, and if I type   precoderm Alt - /code/pre  this will result in   precoderm /tmp/test /code/pre  On an Apple Terminal, this doesen't work, is there an alternative?  <answer85059> I found an answer here:  Equivalent to alt-. in terminal     kbdESC/kbd + kbd./kbd inserts the last argument and is the direct    equivalent to kbdAlt/kbd + kbd./kbd on Linux      see https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/85152/31470   <comment109081> You can also check Preferences  Settings  Keyboard  Use option as meta key.
