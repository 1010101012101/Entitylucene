Installation of Office 365 on 2008 Macbook with OS -X 10.6 failed <body> I was installing Office 365 on 2008 Macbook with OS X 10.6  and about half way through the installation a pop-up said to close Safari to continue installation. When I did, I received another pop up that installation failed. Was I suppose to X out of Safari which is what I did?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3Ce1v.png" alt="Screenshot of Office install requesting that Safari is closed"  <answer181413> You needed to quit Safari "âŒ˜+Q", "X-ing" out of safari only closes the window, not the program.  <comment215768> that's the right way to Quit +1 <comment215771> If I remember correctly the installation won't continue until Safari is completely closed, so the issue isn't that you didn't close Safari properly. I think it must have been something else that caused the installation to fail. <comment215786> An alternative is that you can go to Applications - Utilities - Activity Monitor and kill any Safari processes that may be running.
