How to allow install of non app store or identified developers on MacOS Sierra <body> I'm getting this error trying to install software on MacOS Sierra (10.12.5):  Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App Store and identified developers.  I'd like to change the settings so that these types of installations are allowed. Similar to what is shown here:  http://www.synergy.com/wordpress_650164087/faqs/if-you-get-the-following-error-trying-to-install-kg-under-os-10-8-your-security-preferences-allow-installation-of-only-apps-from-the-mac-app-store-and-identified-developers/  However, my system doesn't seem to have the Anywhere option (screen shot below). This option is also not available if the Advanced button is selected.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zKIn4.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer294015> Just right-click (or kbd^ ctrl/kbd click) the codepkg/code file in question and choose codeOpen/code. This will let you open the file no matter where it came from. Note that this is different from double-clicking.  You can do this with any application downloaded from the Internet, and macOS will remember that application next time you run it.  From a security standpoint, I prefer doing this over disabling the safeguard systemwide.  <answer294016> From: How to Allow Apps from Anywhere in macOS Sierra Gatekeeper     ol   liQuit  out of System Preferences/li   liOpen the Terminal app from the /Applications/Utilities/ folder and then enter the following command syntax:br  precodesudo spctl --master-disable /code/pre/li   liHit return and authenticate with an admin password/li   liRelaunch System Preferences and go to “Security &amp; Privacy” and the “General” tab/li   liYou will now see the “Anywhere” option under ‘Allow apps downloaded from:’ Gatekeeper options/li   /ol   <answer294022> To do this without needing admin privileges and without disabling security features:  ul liOpen up terminal/li liType codexattr -c/code /li liDrag (from finder) the file you wish to open into the terminal window/li liRun the command by pressing Enter/li /ul  codexattr -c/code removes the metadata of a file or folder. This removes the developer, date of download and a few other things. It does not effect the contents of the app.  <comment371056> You can use the Open Anyway feature. That should install it. <comment371064> It is still possible - even on the upcoming High Sierra is it possible <comment371067> I stand corrected—I thought I remembered reading about that somewhere. Thanks for the heads up. <comment371089> Huzzah! Worked exactly as described. Thanks. <comment371095> Did you mean "Note that this is different from double-clicking"? <comment371100> My brain just wasn't quite there this morning
