Remove command removed my important documents on El Capitan <body> I have just made a stupid mistake that cost me a lot. I tried to uninstall a software on my Mac, it is this one here: Uninstallation Ureka and I followed the instructions in the link. On the terminal, I typed exactly as in the documentation:   precoderm -rf $HOME/.ureka  /code/pre  when I suddenly realised after a couple of seconds that this deletes all my important files! I killed the process before it ended but I think it deleted my home folder. All my school work, important files were there. Is there a way I can get them back ? What happened? Could you help me somehow?  <answer231680> Except that the command from the Ureka Web site doesn't do that, of course.  So what did you emactually/em type?  Perhaps something more like  precoderm -rf $HOME / .ureka /code/pre  Note the extra spaces.  In any case, if files were actually removed, learn from the experience, restore your backup, and move on.  <comment282679> Are you using Time Machine or any other backup regime to safeguard yourself from these kinds of disastrous errors? <comment282696> I had Time Machine but at that time it was not turned on... <comment282697> What did that command do? Shouldn't it have just removed Ureka? <comment282698> If you typed the command by hand, it is possible that you hit a space character after the `$HOME/` by mistake. I tried copy/pasting the command from the webpage you referenced, and it would have worked correctly. <comment282699> Yes, I think that is possible. So what can I do in this case? <comment282700> It does not matter of Time Machine was turned on when you deleted the files it matters when TM was last turned on and thus when it backed up the files <comment282703> I do not know if it was ever turned on. How can I check that? <comment282709> This is what happens... <comment282711> What do you mean? Is there a way to get my files back? <comment282727> Without a backup, there is nothing to restore. If you were prudent enough to shutdown the computer as soon as you realized the mistake, it _might_ be possible for a data recovery company, or the app [DiskWarrior](http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/) to get some or most of your data back; but if you continued to use the computer (logged in as another user, for example) for any length of time, crucial data may have been written over. <comment282771> I continued to use the computer for a couple of hours, half a day maybe and then it was shut down. Does this mean that all my data have been written over?
