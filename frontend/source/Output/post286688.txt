After upgrade to OSX Sierra, Password is no longer required after sleep <body> The title is pretty self-explanatory, but after upgrading to OSX Sierra, when I put the computer to sleep and then wake, it no longer asks for my password. This is a BIG issue. Any suggestions for fixing it would be greatly appreciated.  Here's my auto-login settings:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m75Ml.png" alt=""  <comment361766> So, mine was already set correctly. I had to change it, and then change it back.
