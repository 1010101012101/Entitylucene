How to reset Apple Mail's intelligence for moving mails (Sierra)? <body> With Sierra, Apple's Mail.app behaves differently when using the move mail feature. Formerly it just offered you the folder you used the last time. In Sierra Mail.app tends to be much smarter, offering different folders depending on "something", probably sender or maybe also subject (which is unclear to me).  However the problem is that for 80% of the mails I receive from various senders with various subjects Mail.app offers me only one folder to move the mail into which is wrong in 99% of the cases - probably due to the amount of mails in there, even though they are all coming from a certain system (error mails).  Now I wonder if there's anything I can do to reset this logic so that Mail.app starts learning and gets better in offering the correct folder I want to drop a mail.  What can I do?  And: no, I don't want to (and can't actually) create rules on the exchange server to route the mails because it's a) too difficult (context based) and b) I need to have them in the inbox to realize them.
