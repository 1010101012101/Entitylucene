External Drive showing only in system profiler <body> I have had a 1TB Western Digital Ultra external hard drive for nearly year. Out of nowhere it will not show in disk utility but it does show in system profiler. I have a Macbook pro mid 2012 running Yosemite 10.10.1 I have of course tried searching myself but found no clear answers. I tried verifying the main disk and found nothing wrong. Other external drives work fine with this port and cable. Could it be a hard ware failure? Thanks for the support guys I'm just trying to identify possible causes.

System Profiler may show a drive there but if disk utility cant access it, well... "Houston we have a problem."  If it IS an external you could try unplugging any other USB devices and/or trying another USB port and possibly even a different USB cable. If you can easily open the case without voiding the warranty you could check cabling there as well. But that might be a waste of time. Drive enclosures are pretty reliable these days.   Failing that you might try a 3rd party disk utility. But I am not sanguine about the prospects. If Disk Utility doesn't even see the drive there is a good possibility nothing else will. It may be time for a new drive.  <comment210850> Is it visible on a Windows machine? <comment210897> Never used it on a windows machine. The Format is macos journalled and it was working for nearly a year. It suffered no physical damage (no knocks/dropping). I im not so much looking for a fix, more for possible causes. <comment210937> WD has some [firmware drivers & utilities](http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?groupid=223&lang=en) at their Support site. According to docs: WD Drive Utilities â€“ Register your drive, set drive timer, **run diagnostics** and more using WD Drive Utilities. <comment210949> The device listed is actually the USB side of an USB3.0toSATA controller needed to connect the SATA drive to the USB3.0 host controller in your Mac. Your SATA HDD is *not* visible. The HDD is presumably dead or improperly connected to the controller inside the enclosure. <comment291639> Nearly a year later but yes it was a hardware failure.
