What is "legal authority" which is required for iOS developer program? <body> I am trying to enroll into iOS Developer Program as government organization.  One of the requirements is:     The legal authority to bind your company/organization to Apple Developer Program legal agreements.   I am having some confusions with understanding that.  Is it just requiring an ID for a responsible person on the organization, let say the IT manager?  <answer159229> Apple's phrasing is deliberately wide because the terms need to cover a wide range of countries and legal systems.  Depending on the jurisdiction you are in, the meaning of legal authority will differ. Typically, it means the individual agreeing has the power to make a binding agreement between the individual or organisation and Apple Inc.  As an example, a strongLimited Liability/strong company registered in England and Wales would typically require a strongDirector/strong to make the agreement. The Director in this case being able to represent the company unlike an employee or sub-contractor.  As always, if you are unsure of your legal role or position, please get professional advice.  <comment187130> someone with authority to sign a legal document 'for & on behalf' of the company. Only your company/organisation can know who that would be.
