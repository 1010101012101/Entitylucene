Mail 7.2 issues with drafts <body> When I type a reply email multiple copies of this email get saved in drafts.  I've read over the posts tagged codemail.app/code and I thought I hit the jackpot with this answer by @Kyle, but when I navigate to AccountsMailbox Behaviours there is no option for disabling saving drafts on the server,  or am I missing something? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4Tfz.png" alt="enter image description here" I am running Mail 7.2 on an MBP with OS X Mavericks 10.9.2  strongWhen I type a reply email multiple copies of this email get saved in drafts/strong, then these drafts all appear when I have ViewOrganize by Conversation ticked. Our company uses gmail as our mail service. This does not happen when I use my own gmail account.   This is really annoying as when I am writing a long email, there can be an additional 20 "emails" in the email trail.  I get the same behaviour whether I am running IMAP or POP.  Is there a way to stop this?  <answer142510> The reason for this issue was the fact that I had set up the account as a POP account in apple mail.  When IMAP is selected the following screen appears: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/en68F.png" alt="enter image description here" and as can be seen the first item is the one I was looking for.  Drafts : Store draft messages on the server.   strongWhen the option above is not ticked the issue stops./strong  <comment152135> please explain using your own gmail account? is it on same computer, is it also in the work place or at home, <comment152476> @Buscar웃 when I say my own gmail account I mean my personal gmail account.  I have set it up on the same computer that has the issue (running 10.9.2), and also on a different MBP running 10.7.5.  This happens both at work and at home.  If I have not made anything clear please let me know I can provide more screenshots etc. Also I can jump on chat. <comment152511> Well your "Mailbox behavior" is mess up? it is missing a option "Draft"? so I wanted to know if that is same on both accounts, and if it is you need to fix your mail.app installation. <comment152515> Let me check, one tick, I get what you are saying. <comment152523> @Buscar웃 I think I found the issue, the drafts configuration in "Mailbox behaviours" only appears for IMAP accounts, it does not appear for POP accounts, as I have been trying to resolve this I set up a POP account rather than an IMAP. <comment152524> If the problem is solved (sort of) make that findings as an answer so we can move on. <comment152565> Yes, sir,@Buscar웃 sir, will do. Just busy with work right now, I will write up the answer, even have the screenshots ready.
