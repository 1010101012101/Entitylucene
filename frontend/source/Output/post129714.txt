Possibility of allocating memory into different applications - Activity monitor or a 3rd party source <body> Is there a possibility to allocate different amounts of memory into a certain application, or prioritize that application to receive more memory. I am almost positive you cannot do this task with activity monitor but if you can i dont know how. Also is there a 3rd party appellation able to do what i am trying to achieve.   <comment151815> What overall are you trying to do? This prioritisation is what the OS does. The OS gives as much memory as the app requests - so up to the app writer to ask for what it needs <comment151818> Let the operating system does its job allocating memory for each app. There is no gain from allocating additional memory specifically for an app when it doesnâ€™t need it. Just like what @Mark has mentioned, the app will request for more memory when it needs it, and the operating system will give it appropriately.
