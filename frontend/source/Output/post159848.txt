Copy directory from "Get Info" in Yosemite? <body> I am a programmer who used to constantly copy directory of a file from its "Get Info" menu. Since Yosemite, the original pure path is replaced with a "user-friendly" kid-version directory, which cannot be copied. Like this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HiNUC.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a workaround for this?  <answer159849> Take a look here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6610989  One of the suggested answers - drag file into Terminal window or Safari address bar.  <comment187907> Duplicate of [http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47216/copying-the-current-directorys-path-to-the-clipboard](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47216/copying-the-current-directorys-path-to-the-clipboard) <comment187976> He specifically saying that he used the first answer to that question until upgrading to Yosemite.
