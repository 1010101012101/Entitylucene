Change font size for PDF Text Annotation in Preview <body> This should be dead simple: how to customize the font including face, style and modifications. But those configurations are nowhere to be seen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fy6xm.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So ... where is this hidden Preview/pdf toolbar / icon, whatever that allows setting the font ?  Here is what I see on the menu.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3kfk6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Right clicking on the textbox itself brings up the following - note that no way to change any text font/size. This is absurd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s8P1C.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer183315> On my Preview in Mavericks it is right below the main menu bar, where I can select the Font and the size.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EPNj.jpg" alt="font"  <answer183319> In Yosemite, click the toolbox icon.  The tool bar will show all the editing and annotation tools.  One of them is the font configuration. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uKgke.png" alt="Preview Toolbox"  <comment218498> did not notice that. <comment218499> It appears from your screen shot above that you are running Yosemite.
