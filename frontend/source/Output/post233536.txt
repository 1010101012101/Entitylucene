What is the architecture CAD app that was shown in the iPad Pro video <body> In the video for the iPad Pro, there was an architecture app that was shown several times. I assume this is some CAD or floor plan tool available for the new iPad. When I checked on the experience page, it didn't show any CAD tool that was specifically used for architectural drawings.   The best I can guess, it may be AutoCAD 360, something from Morpholio, or uMake. None of those look exactly like the demo so I'm a bit stumped.  Does anyone know for certain what app that was in the video?  <answer233572> I think the app you're referring to is BIMx, our building information viewer app that lets you interact with and explore architectural CAD drawing files on iOS.
