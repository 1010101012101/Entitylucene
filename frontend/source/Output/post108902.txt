How can I turn off the gamed service or more generally, any service? <body> Yeah, bought a Macbook Retina, come from a Linux background where this stuff is usually a question of removing via the package manager.   Anyhow, I don't play games on this, it's purely for business/development. But I keep seeing this gamed process that came down with the Mavericks update trying to phone home.   Apart from software update, I don't really want any process phoning home, especially when I paid 2G for the damned thing.   Anyhow, anyone know how I can disable/uninstall/kill this process for good?  <answer110037> The first thing to do is open the damn thing and log out of Game Center, and delete whatever it still filled in.  <answer116632> This is a cheap hack:  precodesudo mv /System/Library/Frameworks/GameKit.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/gamed /System/Library/Frameworks/GameKit.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/gamed.inactive /code/pre  <answer128913> Specifically for the codegamed/code service, the following command in one of the posts about a similar topic on the Apple Support Communities worked for me, without any need to modify plists or rename files:  precodesudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed disabled -bool true /code/pre  Changing "true" back to "false" will re-enable it, although I've not tried it.  <answer189649> In Yosemite 10.10.3 the codegamed/code process can be found in code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GameCenterFoundation.framework/Versions/A/gamed/code.  I needed to rename the process to get rid of it, the codedefaults write/code and codeunload/code suggestions didn't work.  <answer243332> I'm not sure how to completely disable the process but I've set up Little Snitch to disallow incoming / outgoing processes associated with the Game Center. It's a useful little program.   <answer256503> Apple emreally/em wants this service to run:  precode# pwd /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/GameCenterFoundation.framework/Versions/A # mv gamed gamed.disabled mv: rename gamed to gamed.disabled: Operation not permitted # rm gamed override rwxr-xr-x  root/wheel restricted,compressed for gamed? y rm: gamed: Operation not permitted # ls -l gamed -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  4430368 Jul  9 04:51 gamed /code/pre  This was on El Capitan 10.11.6  <comment129750> I've never even signed in to the Game Center <comment129751> Yeah, it lives at: /System/Library/Frameworks/GameKit.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/gamed <comment129752> tried using launchctl as described in http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/105892/disable-services-in-osx-services-msc <comment129753> But it doesn't show up in the process list. <comment136426> @picsolve_binarytemple it won't it is a daemon and so only runs when something ttys to call it <comment136567> Yeah, that seems to be about the only way to disable that crap. I haven't tried it yet (just blocking it's communication using a firewall) but that seems the only way to turn it off. <comment151106> looks good, lets see if apple honor the setting. <comment171979> You can also run `launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist`. It modifies `/var/db/launchd.db/com.apple.launchd.peruser.$UID/overrides.plist`, which has precedence over the `Disabled` key. <comment224958> See other [answers](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/116632/237) - how does this differ? <comment224968> @Mark game kit - GCF <comment275184> I didn't want to mess with the binary but turning off all settings in System PreferencesNotifications stopped the final phone homes. <comment289696> Even if you are not signed in, the gamed process still tries to contact whatever IP. <comment289697> Cannot do that on OS X El Capitan (without system protection disabled). The launchctl way can be done though. <comment289698> For all of you who find this and will try to use this method on El Capitan, you might be disappointed. I just did the launchctl unload method and that works even on El Capitan. <comment319988> It's probably SIP protected
