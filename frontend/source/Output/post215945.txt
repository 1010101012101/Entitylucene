No Sent Mailbox in Mailbox Behaviors on iphone <body> Emails that I send with my phone aren't showing up in the sent mail folder on my mac, even though I have icloud configured and the mail settings the same on each device.  I am using imap.  In troubleshooting, I went to Mailbox Behaviors to make sure that was set up right, and discovered I have no Sent Mailbox in Mailbox Behaviors on my phone.  I do have a Sent folder, however.  I tried deleting and re-adding the account, but that did nothing to change the problem.  Any ideas?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F67JV.png" alt="Pic2"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/05598.png" alt="Pic3"
