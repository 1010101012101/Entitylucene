Wireless Keyboard for 2016 MacBook Pro <body> Just bought a new MacBook Pro with 4 USB-C ports. When I am at home, I'd like to use a keyboard with a number pad.  Does anyone know of a wireless keyboard that would work?  My first choice is Bluetooth, so I don't have to tie up a USB-C port. But I don't see any that would work.  Would the standard Apple USB keyboard (MB110LL/B) work, if I bought a USB-C to USB adapter? Thanks.
