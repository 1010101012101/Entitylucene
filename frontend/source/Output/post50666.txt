Is it possible to use custom fonts in Mobile Safari? <body> I need to install a font in iPad2, and Safari must be able to use it. Is it possible?  Solution:  I'm developing a iPad2 app using a web wrapper (PhoneGap) and a JS framework (Sencha Touch 2). I need to use custom fonts, for that I need to convert my TTF file (http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) and link the stylesheet.  <answer50669> No, you cannot install fonts on any iOS device without jail breaking or by creating an app.  But Safari can itself display fonts placed on a server with appropriate html code in the page.  <answer50670> As I'm developing a web app, I've converted the TTF file here and linked the generated font file from my CSS stylesheet.  <comment58067> I solved it, posting in a sec. <comment58071> For the benefit of readers, why not explain in more detail what you did to get your font to display on Safari on your iPad. <comment64317> The "solution" doesn't really install a font on the iPad, it just makes sure that the web app has access to it and displays it in Safari correctly. Good if it works for you.
