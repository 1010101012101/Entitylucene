Can Lion be configured to use the three finger drag gesture anywhere in the window? <body> With the proper gesture enabled, Lion allows using a three-finger drag to move a window. However, it only does this when the pointer is over the title bar; gesturing anywhere else in the window does a text highlight instead. Is there a hidden configuration or a hack that would allow three-finger window moving from anywhere inside the window's bounds? Thanks!  <answer23463> Three-finger drag isn't a gesture for "move the window"; it's a gesture for "click and drag." While there might (now or someday) be third-party software that could accomplish your desired behavior, it falls beyond the scope of a simple hidden preference.  <comment26176> Not posting this as an answer because it doesn't actually work, but on the right path: BetterTouchTool allows you to set a modifier key combination that allows you to drag a window from anywhere. Click the *Advanced* option, then under the *Action Settings* area, *Window Moving & Resizing* tab, you can choose which modifier keys to use for such dragging. Unfortunately there's no way in BTT to set three-finger-movement to press those keys, but it may be that there's another utility out there that will.
