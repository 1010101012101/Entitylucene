Macbook Pro Push Notification for Hotmail <body> I received a notification from Apple stating that push notifications for Hotmail is getting revoked on April 8th.   Can someone help me reactivating this notification?  <answer277941> Your Apple ID at some point was used to generate a certificate.   Either log in to your servers/service or MDM that use push services or start here:  ul lihttps://identity.apple.com/pushcert//li /ul  <comment349768> I guess "apply" should be changed to "Apple"? It's not clear to me what notification you received. Perhaps you can add a screenshot of the notification?
