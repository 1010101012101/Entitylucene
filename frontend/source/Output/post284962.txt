Timestamps on Messenger - iOS and OSX <body> I can very easily see timestamps for texts (SMS) and messages (wifi? not really sure what this is) on iOS messenger by swiping to the left. However, in the Messenger app on OSX (10.11.6 El Capitan), I cannot for the life of my get these timestamps to appear (swiping, right-clicking a message, app options and context menus, etc.)  strongHow do I show timestamps for messages in the Messages app on OSX?/strong The best that Messages gives me is a collection of messages that is "around" a timestamp that is apparently relevant, e.g.br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFZYU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer284981> Just hover your cursor over the relevant message for a few seconds, the time &amp; date will pop up in a tooltip.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ExazG.png" alt="enter image description here"  Picture with clear date also shown, to demonstrate it's accurate.br sub&amp; those verification codes are well out of date.. ;-) /sub  <comment359398> How unintuitive... I guess my own impatience gets the better of me! I tend not to hover on things for very long. Thanks! <comment359399> I actually like how it doesn't litter a convo with cruft; you kind of know if a convo all took place within a few mins, or was stretched over several hours/days.
