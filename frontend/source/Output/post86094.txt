XCode Hangs at Startup <body> XCode fails to open on my machine - OS X 10.8.2. It opens the main screen and just hangs there with the spinner spinning becoming unresponsive. If I double clcik a project, it just hangs sating it is loading.   I tried:    ol liUninstalling and re-installing;/li liRemoving my project tree;/li liDeleting some recommended preferences, most of which did not actually exist on my machine to begin with./li /ol  Things of note:  ol liThis is a new computer. The first time I ran XCode, it opened fine, though I didn't try using it. The problem appeared when I first opened an existing project./li liI created a new user on the machine. When that user is logged on XCode loads successfully. Apparently it is a user settings issue./li /ol  <answer89357> No need to reinstall XCode.  Based on this:  ol liI deleted all XCode related "Unsaved Docs" docs found via the Finder search;/li liI removed the code~/Library/Developer/code folder;/li liEmptied the trash./li /ol  This worked for me.  <answer114031> A slightly improved answer:   I didn't need to reinstall xCode at all, just remove the 'unsaved documents':  Search in code~/Library/code for xcode (by name) (to search, you go to this folder, enter xcode, with the drop down choose "by name", and then click the "Library delete anything matching in code~/Library/Caches/code or "code~/Library/Autosave Information/code" or that looks like it might be an unsaved documents  <answer159609> Removing the code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.dt.Xcode.savedState//codedirectory might help as well.  <answer243348> I had a similar problem where xcode was hanging on opening one particular project.  I wanted a very precise fix without having to remove all the settings. I deleted codeproj.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/xcuserdata/&lt;user&gt;.userdatad/UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate/code from the em.xcodeproj/em folder and that solved the problem.  So if you are having Xcode hang while attempting to open one particular project, this is the file that you need to delete.  <comment99310> For user settings look in ~/Library/Preferences and look for anything with Xcode in - try deleting them <comment99367> The irony - a developer tool hanging. You could always run `sysdiagnose` on Xcode and submit a bug report to Apple :) <comment102651> @Mark, I tried that. No avail. <comment135835> You need to unhidden files first then try this : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19473231/xcode-5-crashes-on-new-project-creation <comment174007> @bmike - Xcode is without any doubt the worse piece of software Apple ever wrote. Xcode was always bad but things escalated with Xcode 4. It is a shame that they continue to cram crap to the app instead of fixing errors that are there since Xcode 4. I need to hire someone to invent new profanities to me because I have  used my repertoire. <comment174008> @Mike I hear you. For me iTunes causes me more angst and grief than any other piece of Apple software, but I know of many excellent developers that swear at Xcode far more than they swear by it. It's clearly on the bleeding edge and less stable than most other suites from Apple. <comment174009> @bmike - not just it is not stable but it is half cooked. Ten minutes using autolayout for the first time and I have discovered at least 4 bugs and two limitations of poor design and bad testing. Xcode is a pool of half cooked stuff stitched together. <comment213940> Genius. You saved my day. Thanks. <comment214965> this did the trick on xcode 6.3. Thanks! <comment317059> `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/xcode ` worked for me. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment327329> This does not work with xcode 7+. See @adi-shavit answer. <comment344208> This worked for me, thanks!
