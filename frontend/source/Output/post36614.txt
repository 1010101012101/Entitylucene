Skype Bookmarked Chat Issue <body> I have a desktop running Ubuntu 11.04 and a MacBook Pro. I have 2 bookmarked chats under Linux version of Skype, but it's not showing under Mac version.  Any suggestion?  <answer38217> chat bookmarks only work locally on your machine, these are not synchronized across different machines  more over, chat history is stored locally but normally last 30 days update/sync across different machines
