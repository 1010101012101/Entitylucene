Get List Of Keyboard Shortcuts By Application <body> Is there anyway to use AppleScript or a system utility to obtain a list of Application Shortcuts...?   I've seen Apps like CheatSheet but I want to make my own cheatsheets. (i.e. physical ones I can stick on the wall by my Mac)  <comment327151> Screenshot the CheatSheet popover and print? <comment327174> I would like to be able to re-format the Cheat Sheets with my own formatting.
