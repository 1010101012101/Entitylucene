All Tags Not Showing on Mac Right Click <body> Ok, this is a simple one that has been bugging me for months. I've searched here, Google, everywhere for an answer. There is plenty of info about creating tags, changing the names/colors, assigning tags to Finder folders, even customizing the right click menu itself.  My tags just disappeared from the right click, not the tags section, just the tag color bubbles themselves. I could always click on the 'Tags...' button and that would load a tags dialog that I could then select the tags I wanted, but to more quickly tag I should see them below that (screenshot here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zback6xt43tetva/Screenshot%202017-04-10%2020.14.09.png?dl=0)  <answer280328> Finally, just annoyed one night I called Apple support since I still have coverage on my new Macbook. The lady struggled just like me, no articles there about it, couldn't figure out. But after about 30 mins of poking around, she figured it out. And it's WAY simple.  ol liGo to Finder  Preferences/li liClick on the Tags menu option/li liHere you will see a list where you can show/hide in your sidebar/li liBelow that there is a little box, you can DRAG the tags from the upper section to the lower section which determines which tags show in your right click./li /ol  That's it. Simple. I'm dumb. Hopefully this helps someone.
