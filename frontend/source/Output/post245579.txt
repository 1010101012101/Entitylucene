Camera never flashes and cannot change from "Auto" to "On" <body> I am running iOS7 on my iPhone 4s.  The camera's flash setting does not change from "Auto" when I tap it. The same is true for the HDR setting. Even when it should flash in "Auto" mode it does not.  The flashlight works so I don't think there is a hardware problem. This occurred after leaving my phone inactive and uncharged for around 2 months.   Rebooting has not worked and I cannot find the same issue - flashlight working but camera flash failing. Any ideas?
