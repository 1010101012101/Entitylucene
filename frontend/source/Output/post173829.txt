Can I upgrade an iPhone 5S directly to 8.3 from 7.1.3? <body> I am unable to upgrade iOS from 7.1.3 to 8.3 on my iPhone 5S. Can I upgrade directly to 8.3 or do I have to do it in stages i.e. from 7.2 onwards?  <answer173855> I presume you mean 8.1.3 … &amp; also 7.1.2, as there never was a 7.1.3 afaik  You can go straight to it - in fact, there's no other option. It's the only route.br Apple stops signing old releases shortly after a new one comes out, so an older version wouldn't work, even if you got hold of it.  Safest route to any update is…  ul liSync to iTunes/li liBackup to iTunes/li liDownload the update from iTunes, without updating./li liUpdate as a separate step [ensures the download is full &amp; complete before starting]/li /ul  Belt &amp; braces - you have a full, recent backup of the current state should anything go wrong.  <answer173923> If you mean from iOS 7.1.3 to iOS 8.3 beta. you do not have to update to iOS 8.2 beta first. Be warned: this will wipe all of your data.  <comment204821> I tried that but it hangs up after several hours of download. Tried this three times after connecting to macbook pro but failed I do not know why. Direct download / update on iPhone 5s failed 5 times. Never knew that Apple could make such a painful process of updating. <comment204823> 'hangs up after several hours of download' That would be your connection, nothing to do with Apple. I can get an ipsw file in about 30s. Try getting the file via http://ipswdownloader.com [files are from the same place but you can use a downloader] <comment204824> tell a lie - it took 4 mins.
