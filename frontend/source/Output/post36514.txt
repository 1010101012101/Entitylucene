Create event in iCloud calendar for different time zone <body> How do I create a future event in a different time zone than I'm currently on?  For example, I reside in Toronto (UTC-5) and I am going to Hong Kong (UTC+8). When I'm still in Toronto, I want to be able to create an event (in Hong Kong time) so that when I arrive in Hong Kong, the event appears correctly in the local time.  <answer36520> I am assuming that you are using the website for this.  Go to iCloud, and open the Calendar app.  Click on the gear at the top-left, then click preferences.  Go to the advanced tab, and check "Enable time zone support".  Now, when you edit an event, you can select the time zone in the event information.  <answer36526> Time zone support also works on the iCal app on the mac and on the iPhone.  Preferences in iCal and Settings/Mail,Contacts,Calendars on the iPhone.  These can then be synced to iCloud.  <answer233228> Flexibits just released an update to their Fantastical 2 application that supports multiple timezones. Users of Microsoft Outlook will appreciate it: New in 2.2   Just a happy user, I don't work for the company.
