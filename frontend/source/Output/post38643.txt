Faulty USB port? Will the iPod mount on another computer? <comment43786> Tried a second winXP PC. Same. iPod is treated as a mobile disk. iTunes is revived but there is no iPod listed at all. If open the disk from "my computer", there are 3 folders: Calendars, Contacts, Notes. What can I do now? <comment43826> I read and followed that. Only, I can't find "Apple Mobile Device USB Driver" from the hardware manager. But I have "iPod device" under "disk" section. I tried to update its driver to ipod driver according to the assistant, but when "install from disk", I can't see iPod. That's when I stop..
