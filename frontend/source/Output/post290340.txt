Missing fonts in Preview <body> I often use the Preview toolbar in order to add text on PDF files. This feature is very convenient but I realized that a lot of fonts are missing in the font menu of the tool bar. Investigating a bit, I figured out that the fonts missing are the one missing from the English smart collection of the Font Book (called "Fran√ßais" in my case), in which I can't add new fonts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhHv5.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBj6U.png" alt="enter image description here"  Does anyone know how to change the default Smart Collection that Preview opens? Or maybe a way to add fonts to the English Smart Collection?  I am using Preview 9.0 with MacOS Sierra version 10.12.5.
