Trying to find the board ID for Mac Pro 1,1 (no OS currently installed, can't access terminal) <body> I'm trying to install Mavericks on an old MacPro1,1 (This one), and I need the correct board ID to properly configure the USB install.  I currently do not have any OS installed on the HDD, so I cann't access terminal in order to find the board ID.    Does anybody know the board ID for this model?  <answer145695> To install Mavericks, you need one of these Macs:  precodeiMac (Mid-2007 or later) MacBook (13-inch Aluminum, Late 2008), (13-inch, Early 2009 or later) MacBook Pro (13-inch, Mid-2009 or later), MacBook Pro (15-inch or 17-inch, Mid/Late 2007 or later) MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later) Mac mini (Early 2009 or later) Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later) Xserve (Early 2009)  /code/pre  Your Mac also needs:  precodeOS X Mountain Lion, Lion, or Snow Leopard v10.6.8 already installed 2 GB or more of memory 8 GB or more of available space /code/pre  Yours is 2006 model!  Since you can not see the logic board ID, you have to open the computer and find the label.  <answer187742> For the Mac Pro 1,1 and 2,1 you will need to add "Mac-F4208DC8","Mac-F4208DA9". If you are not using a Mac Pro then you will need to get your board ID by entering this command in terminal: ioreg -lp IOService | grep board-id  <answer187753> According to MacTracker, the highest OS that computer can handle is OS 10.6.8.  So your best bet is a 10.6 install DVD.  <answer249240> use this to get the board ID for any mac:  I didnt write it, I poached it from somewhere....(just paste in the terminal as one line.    precodevar_ID=$(ioreg -p IODeviceTree -r -n / -d 1 | grep board-id);var_ID=${var_ID##*&lt;\"};var_ID=${var_ID%%\"&gt;};echo $var_ID /code/pre  chris  <comment171731> I am not sure Mavericks will work with that hardware. <comment254838> Thanks for the 2 most requested board ID's (64on32 and Tiamo hackable) and a bigger thank you for the terminal command. <comment254839> Mavericks will work on the MacPro 1,1 and MacPro 2,1.  Google "Tiamo boot.efi hack" or "64 on 32", I prefer 64on32 because they make a nice terminal script that will help create a thumbdrive installer.  Source: I just bought a 1,1 for $100 and installed Mavericks via thumbdrive.
