Difference between network service disabled, inactive and interface down <body> There are (at least) four difference ways for me to disable my Wi-Fi on my Mac:  ol liClick on the Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar and select "Turn Wi-Fi Off"/li liSystem Preferences-Network, select Wi-Fi, click Cog, select Make Service Inactive/li licodesudo ifconfig en0 down/code/li licodenetworksetup -setnetworkserviceenabled Wi-Fi off/code/li /ol  The first two are equivalent, i.e. they change the same setting.  What I'd like to understand is, at a low level, what are the fundamental differences between 1, 3 and 4?
