Disable F14/F15 for Brightness Control <body> My new iMac (2017, running 10.12.5) has by default F14/F15 bound to control the display brightness. I can't find any way to disable them, which means that binding them to other functions doesn't work. Using a third party tool like Keyboard Maestro can map the keys, but doesn't override the brightness adjustment, so you get two functions at once.  In my research it seems that some versions of Mac OS had a strongDisplay/strong option under strongKeyboard Shortcuts/strong that had the applicable options: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XbgPf.png" alt="Keyboard Shortcuts Preferences"  emUnfortunately I don't have that/em.  So my question is: strongHow do I get that Display section back, or how do I unbind the decrease/increase display brightness shortcuts?/strong  <answer287636> The strongDisplay/strong section in Keyboard Shortcuts shows up when a strongthird-party/strong (non-Apple) keyboard is attached (I used a USB one, I don't have a wireless one to test). From there I was able to disable the shortcut keys.  Once I was able to disable them, I did some digging to find where the preferences are stored behind the scenes. Turns out that they live in code~Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code.  Setting the codeenabled/code property to codefalse/code for keys 53 through 56 of the codeAppleSymbolicHotKeys/code dictionary, will disable the F14/F15 brightness adjustments (this doesn't affect the F1/F2 keys on Apple keyboards).  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:53:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:54:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:55:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:56:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /code/pre  The change will take place after a logout or restart. If you want to re-enable them, change codefalse/code to codetrue/code.  <answer295760> robmathers answer is correct in spirit, but didn't work for me on strongRetina iMac 27" (2017)/strong with full-size strongApple Magic Keyboard 2/strong on strongmacOS Sierra 10.12.6/strong. The plist keys in the strongcom.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/strong were different. Here are the commands that worked for me:  precode/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:7:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :AppleSymbolicHotKeys:12:enabled false" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist /code/pre  Don't forget to restart the computer (simply logging out doesn't work). After this is done you'll be free to map these keys.
