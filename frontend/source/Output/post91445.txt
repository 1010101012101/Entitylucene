How to remove an environment variable on OSX using bash <body> I'm running under Snow Leopard 10.6.8 and I recently added an environment variable which it seems to be messing my bash terminal (I guess).   What I did is add the variable codeDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/lib/code to my .bash_profile file, which looks like this:  precodeexport PATH=/Users/Carlos/pear/bin:$PATH:/Users/Carlos/android-sdks/platforms:/Users/Carlos/android-sdks/platforms-tools:/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/bin/ # Setting PATH for Python 2.7 # The orginal version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave PATH="/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin:${PATH}" export PATH export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.2/lib /code/pre  And then run the command:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  So that now I can see the variable listed along with all the environment variables when I run "set" on the terminal.  The thing is I want to remove it. I've checked several forums and to be honest none of the solutions worked for me so far.  <answer91446> unset it  precodeunset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /code/pre  The bash reference manual says     Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the unset builtin command.    <comment107492> Can you not simply remove that line and run `source ~/.bash_profile` again?
