VMware Fusion taking too long to expand disk? <body> I'm running Windows 10 Home in a VM under VMware Fusion 8.5.3 on macOS Sierra 10.12.2. Machine is MacBook Pro (15", Late 2016).  I shut down the Windows guest, and through its settings, attempted to expand the disk from 60GB to 150GB. I have 300GB+ available on the host.  So far, this is what I've been looking at for about 20 minutes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4NUap.png" alt="enter image description here"  How much longer should I wait before giving up? And, if I must give up, what can I do to have the best possible chance that my guest vm isn't totally hosed?  <answer283413> Solution to this is: strongjust wait/strong.  However, there is a little caveat, if you want that this transition is really successfully and fast you need to temporary turn on Time Machine backup.  <comment341900> You patience ought probably to be in direct proportion to the date since your last backup. <comment353926> What was the result. Same deal here, thing has been hanging for a while. <comment357296> Same here ... Hanging up ... But I will wait and let you know. <comment357298> What does Time Machine backup have to do with expanding the disk for the VM? <comment357425> It somehow interfere with backup disk operation service and vm ware disk expansion service ... Quite logical to me ...
