Dragging files onto desktop causes Finder window to unwantedly open <body> Every time I drag a file onto my desktop, my finder folder opens. This is new to OS X 10.9 Mavericks. How do I disable this behavior?  <answer110588> I found a similar question that said it's a problem with Google Chrome.  Using the latest version of Chrome seems to solve the problem.  <comment130227> This is really annoying me too, but this does not happen every time.
