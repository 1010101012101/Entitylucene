Where is the new San Francisco font? <body> I have an 27" IMAC (mid-2011) upgraded all the way from Snow Leopard-Lion-Mountain Lion-Mavericks-Yosemite-El Capitan.  I am curious abot the new System Font (San Francisco) however I cant find it in any font lists? Not in FontBook either? So where is it?  Thx!  <comment253384> Apple currently isn't allowing people to use it. <comment253387> At one point in time, don't know if it's still available, if you have a paid iOS Developer account it was available for download from https://developer.apple.com.  Although its SLA stated "You may use the San Francisco font solely for purposes of design and development of applications for the Apple Watch." <comment253389> There is an entire WWDC session dedicated to this. In short, you cannot access the font by name or by file path. https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015-804/ (Relevant part starts at 29:00)
