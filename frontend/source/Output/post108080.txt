Is InsomniaX working on Mavericks? <body> It seems to me that InsomniaX, a utility to let a MacBook stay awake when the lid is closed, is not working on Mavericks. Can anyone confirm for me?  <answer108337> I experience the same. The "Disable strongIdle/strong Sleep" selection is automatically turned off and the computer goes to sleep after some time.  <answer108726> It does work to disable the sleep on lid close, however, I've been getting random restarts with it running.  <answer131492> Doesn't work at my MBA mid 2011, with Mavericks 10.9.3.  <comment154489> Which hardware and Mavericks version did it works at for you? <comment154502> @grgarside Could you detail how exactly it doesn't answer the question? To me, it looks it completely does. <comment154503> Apologies, misclicked in the review queue â€” thanks for pointing it out <comment154504> @grgarside Looks like your delete vote is still there. <comment154506> Can't remove delete votes on mobile :( It'll disappear after a while though as no one else will vote <comment159498> @GeorgeGarside Still didn't disappear.
