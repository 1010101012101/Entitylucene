Apple numeric keyboard navigation buttons <body> I use the apple numeric keyboard (swedish)  Is there a way for me to use the end, home, down upp keys when composing text on a mac? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ftc9F.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Nothing happens when I press them? I would like to be able to jump to the end of a line and down to the end of a text. The only options I have figured out is with help of the apple cmd and alt buttons, and the arrow keys.  When are those keys used?
