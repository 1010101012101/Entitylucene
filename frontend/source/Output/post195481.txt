Slow OSX booting with black screen before apple logo <body> Every time I boot my macbook, there is always a black screen before the Apple Logo pops up. The blackscreen stays for around 15-20 seconds. How can I resolve that problem?  <answer195482> It can happen, if you doesn't have selected a specific start-volume.  ol liFrom the Apple menu choose System Preferences./li liClick the Startup Disk icon in System Preferences, or choose View  Startup Disk./li liSelect your startup disk from the list of available volumes./li /ol  After that, restart your mac and the blackscreen shouldn't appear before a start.  <comment233361> Starting with OS X Yosemite, this black screen will appear for a longer time then before (but not for 15-20 sec.) - why I don't know - but it does. And I have only one Startup disk which is default selected in System Preferences. <comment233362> Which OS X version are you talking about ?? <comment240357> Thanks this worked for me. New to OS X and just bought a macbook pro. No idea why this wasn't on by default. The pause was so long at times I thought my macbook had died already.
