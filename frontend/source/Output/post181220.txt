Where can I download iOS 8.4 Beta safely, and how do I install it? <body> I've just seen a video on the new Music app in iOS 8.4 Beta. Now if possible I would like to try it, so I simply googled em"iOS 8.4 Beta download"/em. I was hoping to find it in some developer section of an Apple website, but only found it on third party websites.br Can I assume that the software is going to be safe, when downloading it from websites like Chip.de (which is usually a trustworthy source).br How would I go about installing the software, as there are normally updates in iTunes or on the iOS device itself?  <answer181223> iOS 8.4 is not an open beta, so you have to be registered Apple developer (99$ a year) to use beta software on your iOS device.  Also note that getting the software-package is not enough. You're devices UID has to be registered with apple so it will activate when you install the beta software.  <comment215486> Ah, too bad for me then :D <comment215488> There's also the golden rule - never install beta software on any mission-critical device ;)
