Change lockscreen date language iOS 6 <body> When I first configured my new iPod touch 5th gen, I put "English" for iOS language. I then switched iOS to "Fran√ßais (Canada)" in the General Settings/International. Everything look fine except one thing : The date displayed on the lockscreen which remains in english (Ex: Monday, 15 April). Even after restarting my iPod, the date is still in english.  Any idea how to have the date translated on the lockscreen ?  <answer88788> Check out by going to Settings -- General -- Date &amp; Time.  <answer88968> Under codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; International/code, you need to change the codeRegion Format/code settings to specify your desired region; I'm assuming you only changed the emcodeLanguage/code/em settings.  When I change Region Format to codeFrench -&gt; Canada/code, my lockscreen appears with the correct French date format: codemardi 16 avril/code.  <answer88970> The format and language of Date &amp; Time (and other units of measure) are set in  Settings - General - International - Region Format.   These can be set independently of the language used throughout the rest of your iOS device.  <comment104108> There isn't a language config there. There are 3 settings : 24-hour time, Set automatically and Time zone. <comment104338> Kinda confusing, since when I go in `Settings - General - International`, `Region Format` display only `Canada`, so I did not bother looking there since I thought it was already correct. BUT `French - Canada` is not part of the available values there. It just switched to a random Region, went back and reset it to `Canada` and then it worked o_O <comment104339> Bizarre. When I tapped French in the Region Format listing, I was taken to a screen that lets you pick *sub-*regions, and that's where I chose Canada. Glad you got it sorted. :)
