iTerm2 and MacVim - how to make them play nicely together <body> I use vim with this wonderful plugin which constantly changes my codecolorscheme/code in order to let me find my perfect one.  I use iTerm 2 too, which is themed itself. Now, when I use the non-GUI version of MacVim (codemvim/code) I installed via codebrew/code, my color schemes are loaded properly but they don't always play nicely with the "background" iTerm theme. I.e. I see the background color of iTerm2 popping out on the sides when using codemvim/code.  Is there a way to "adapt" iTerm 2 to the current codemvim/code theme?  <comment106616> In this case mvim is not sending the correct codes to iterm - check the value of TERM that is set by iTern
