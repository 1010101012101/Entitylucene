Password not working (it said the password I typed in was wrong) <body> Alright, so I just got my iMac back from the store and I login to it knowing my password was correct, later I was trying to download a JDK but a window pop up asking me for the password of the admin account. I proceeded to entered my password but it won't accept it, all it does is say that it's wrong although I typed the exact same password. I tried contacting many people that I know but it still isn't working. Is there anyone who can identify this problem for me? If so then please do tell me how to fix it.  <answer260914> It has been a while since I have tried this so I emassume/em it still works  ol liTurn off your Mac (choose Apple  Shut Down). /li liPress the power button  while holding down Command-R.

Maybe they needed to reset the admin password to get your iMac fixed.
