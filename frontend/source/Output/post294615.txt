Unable to sign into Hangouts on iPad mini 4 <body> I am getting the message: "Unable to add account" on both my iOS devices every time I try to use the Hangouts app; it has never done this before. I've tried reinstalling the app multiple times on both, and I disconnected my google voice from hangouts. Still doesn't work. I tried 2 different accounts. I can access all other Google services and can sign into hangouts on my computer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6afxW.png" alt="Screenshot"  If someone has any ideas as to how to fix this, I'd greatly appreciate it.  <comment371910> This happened to me also today and I tried again two hours later and suddenly it worked <comment371958> That worked for me too. Thanks!
