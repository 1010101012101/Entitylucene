Does Mail support multiple email accounts? <body> Does Mail support multiple email accounts? If yes, how can I set them up?  <answer1468> Yes, it does. From within Mail, open up preferences, select the Accounts tab, and click on the small "+" button in the lower left-hand corner of the window. This will run the "Add Account" wizard to guide you through the rest of the steps.  <comment1284> @Chealion: I do believe you've misspelled "Mail.app" in that tag. <comment1285> @e.James: Oops. Thanks. Fixed that.
