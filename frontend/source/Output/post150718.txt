Tips for optimizing performance in OneNote across several PCs, tablet, and phone <body> I've been noticing my OneNote being sluggish lately, even for entering text notes. For each of my research projects, I keep a "log" page where I just enter text notes (and sometimes a link or graphic, more frequently link). To just insert text is much more sluggish than it is in Word. I'm wondering why this is and if I can fix it somehow.   What other optimization tips for OneNote can you all offer. I'm not looking for tips on how to use OneNote per se, but optimization of the sync and speed of interface (particularly the interface). Here are some specific questions.   1) Is it better to have more notebooks with fewer sections, or more sections in fewer notebook, for fixed content. I'm thinking strickly of performance here.  2) Does the content on a page affect performance of the page (specifically updating and adding content)? In other words, does it matter if it's just text, links, images, icons, etc.   3) What settings should I check to make sure that my OneNote pages are ready to go when I open them. I often notice, particularly on the Android app on my phone and tablet, that I open a page to update it and have to wait for it to sync first. I wish this could happen before I need to update the note.  I can describe my hardware and OS setups, but they're all pretty decent computers running Win 7, one Galaxy Note II and one Asus tablet.  PS - I'm using OneNote 2010 on the PCs.
