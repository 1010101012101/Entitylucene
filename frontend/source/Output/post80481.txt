Unable to mount DMG - appearing as a folder <body> I downloaded a DMG in multiple parts, split into .dmg.001, .dmg.002 etc.   I "uncompressed" the first file (just double-clicked and a single folder .dmg got created)  The dmg is of the right size (690 MB). However I can only see it as a "folder" in Finder. I can't mount the DMG. Instead I see a "file" inside it called "hfs".  That doesn't seem right at all. What's happening? Have I just got a corrupted DMG or is there more to it?  P.S: I don't know which software the split DMG's were created with.  <comment92876> P.S: I was able to merge the multi-part DMG using "Keka". However Stuffit refused to recognize the first file .dmg.001
