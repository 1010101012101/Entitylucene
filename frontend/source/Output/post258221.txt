IMac OS 10.10.3 connected to G5 OS 10.4 - Can't share Hard Discs <body> I'm trying to set up file sharing between these 2 Macs.  When I connect to the server from the iMac I can only access the personal folder on the G5. I don't have any option to connect to the G5's disc drive.  Oddly on the G5 I can access the hard discs on the iMac.  Permissions in Get Info all set to read/Write .. can't find anyplace else to control it?  Any ideas?
