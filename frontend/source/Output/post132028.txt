safari couldn't display certain jpeg images <body> The images captured by my logitech webcam which encodes them into MJPEG images before delivering to host computer couldn't be displayed by safari while chrome could. http://wikisend.com/download/943784/pic1.jpg is the image. How to reencode it to be supported by safari?  <comment155308> It works for me. Try running `curl http://i.stack.imgur.com/qqToh.png | base64 | sed 's#^#data:image/png;base64,#' | pbcopy` and paste into your Safari URL bar. Are you using an older version of Safari? <comment155479> @0942v8653 I'm sorry safari couldn't display the image at all. The image was captured by logitech webcam which compresses it into MJPEG encoding onboard before delivering to host computer. This image can be opened using chrome but not safari. If I send U the image can u suggest me safari supporting encoding method? <comment155487> Oh, I didn't realize it was a problem with a specific image. I'll have a look when I'm on my computer later, but you're right, it doesn't show up on my phone. <comment157028> The image don't have Huffman table. Is there a way to hint safari to insert standard Huffman table in it? <comment157047> No, that's not something Safari can do. The built-in OS X image viewer doesn't support images like that. MJPEG's Huffman table appears to be sent at the beginning of the video, so it cannot be split into multiple images without losing some data (data that Safari apparently needs).
