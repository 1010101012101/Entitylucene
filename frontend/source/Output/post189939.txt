How to mute a FaceTime iPhone call on OS X through a shortcut? <body> When using FaceTime on OS X 10.10 to initiate a call using the iPhone, is there a shortcut that allows me to mute the call from the keyboard?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NoJc2.png" alt="phone call in Facetime"  Is there a keyboard shortcut (or a way to setup a shortcut) to trigger the emMute/em function?  <answer189941> Yes you can! Here are the steps:  ol liOpen Automator and create an Automator Service, with a single Run AppleScript action, containing the following code:  precodetell application "System Events"     if checkbox "Mute" of window 1 of application process "FaceTime" exists then         click checkbox "Mute" of window 1 of application process "FaceTime"     end if end tell /code/pre/li liSet the service to receive "no input" and to work in "any application", save it with a name of your choosing./li liNow, go into the Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard preferences in System Preferences, and click on Services. The newly created service should be at the bottom, under the name you chose. Click on the service, then click on "add shortcut" to its right, and specify a shortcut to your liking./li liYou may have to grant Automator and/or FaceTime access in Accessibility in the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy preferences./li /ol  That's it! You should now have a service set up, tied to the shortcut you chose that can be accessed from anywhere.  <answer252892> In El Capitan (OS X 10.11) I had to make the following changes for the script to work:  1) I had to change the two instances of "checkbox" in the script to "button".  2) To use as a shortcut, I had to grant FaceTime, not Automator, access in Accessibility in the Privacy tab of the Security and Privacy preferences. (But if you want to test the script from Automator, then it too needs to be granted access.)  <comment225389> Thanks - this is brilliant! I had to allow Automator to use the assistive services in System Preferences for this to work, but after that it's working great! I've assigned it to `Ctrl+Alt+M` <comment225390> My pleasure! I think I'll add that as a fourth step for completeness. <comment315553> I'm on 10.11.6 and "button" did not work but "checkbox" still did. I did have to grant FaceTime access. <comment365283> This would have been better as a comment, because it doesn't answer the question. I'll update my answer to reflect this.
