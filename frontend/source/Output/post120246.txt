Software to track income and spending on OS X and Android <body> There is this other question that asks about What OS X and iOS software combination tracks finances?  But most of the software listed there is much to powerful (and complicated) for me. I just tried out the demo for YNAB, but I can't get my head around that software. What the hell is a budget, anyway?  All I want is a very simple tool that allows me to:  ul libegin with a starting balance/li lienter monthly income (salary)/li lienter monthly expenses (rent, health insurance, telephone)/li liemoptional:/em with date/li liemoptional:/em quarterly / yearly payments/li liemoptional:/em enter an end date for these monthly monetary flows (e.g. a loan that will be paid at a certain date)/li lienter spendings on my mobile phone as they happen/li licalculate a live balance and display it/li /ul  I don't want to:  ul litrack stocks/li licreate a savings plan/li liconnect to my bank account/li liany other stuff/li /ul  Plus:  ul lilooks nice/li liexports / saves to file in a format that other software can read (e.g. csv, MySQL database)/li /ul  I would use an Excel sheet, if I didn't want to use it on my mobile phone.  Any suggestions?  <answer120268> It's not mac specific, but I'd recommend checking out Mint.com.  I was originally skeptical of letting a service connect to my bank accounts, but after using for a little while I am now a believer.   If you categorize your transactions for a month or two it learns, and you'll find that you need to spend less and less time manually entering data.  <comment140300> I'm not in the US (nor Canada) and cannot use Mint. I need software that does not require a US bank account.
