Super simple accessibility app for iPad/iPod Touch <body> My mother is now visually impaired and I've got an old iPad which I want to turn into a "audiobook station" for her. However, with the vision problems, operating the Music App turns out to be impossible (also, she's 80+y/o and really not into tech). Also, accessibility options on the tablet were not enough.   I can take care of keeping the iPad online and feed with new books, but I wish she had at least the ability to play/pause the book at any given moment. For that, would be ideal if the screen were a big simple Play/Pause button she'd simply hit once.  Kind of like Big Button Music Player but hopefully even simpler.  Suggestions?  <answer131499> This list of apps is for the people with low vision or the blind.  There was blind guy I met that was using an app that used sound and voice when he moved his fingers across the iPad.  http://www.applevis.com/apps/ios-apps-for-blind-and-vision-impaired
