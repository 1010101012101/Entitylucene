Is delegation of a calendar possible on using Office 365 and any client whatsoever on Mac? <body> I am looking for any way for OS X users to use Office 365's exchange calendaring service to delegate / share a calendar with another user on Office 365.  I have researched the MS knowledge base which states that for delegation, you need both an Exchange server (which I presume Office 365 is) and either Outlook 2010 or 2013 - neither of which run on OS X. If I have to, I could get to these software to temporarily sign in and set up the delegation, but I don't want to run Windows day in and day out and need a native OS X solution.  Short of running Windows virtually day to day, can OS X users use delegation features of Office 365?  <answer97619> Delegate access is available in Outlook 2011 but strongnot in Outlook Web App/strong, nor in Apple's Mail client.  Here are the instructions:  How to set up 365 with Mac and Exchange server.  <comment114559> Wondering why there would be a Microsoft Exchange on my MBA (in mail, Contacts, Calender) with os 10.8 if one could not use it ? <comment114566> Please specif is it for internal use only (you have internal Exchange server), or is it the 365 web application. <comment114570> Office 365 in my mind is a cloud only service, but I'll check your link and see if perhaps I need to narrow down the wording as you ask to prevent confusion. <comment114663> What client on OS X allows delegation? Only Outlook 2011 is what I'm assuming you mean - but I'm not seeing the same screens as the help article with an Office 365 account. <comment114673> QUOTE: OS X Lion (10.7) or later has built-in Exchange support to set up Mac Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes, and Reminders to work with your Office 365 account. <comment114856> It looks like the only client that works with Office 365 is Microsoft Outlook 2011.
