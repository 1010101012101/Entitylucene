How can I use my existing Time Machine drive on the network? <body> I have an external HD that I've been using as a time machine for my MBP.  Here's what I want to do:  ul liattach the drive to my desktop machine/li liconfigure time machine on my MBP to use the drive as a time machine through the network/li listrongretain my existing backups.../strong/li /ul  So I want time machine to continue using the same backups it always did when the drive was connected locally.  strongI do not want to start from scratch./strong  I know how to set time machine to use a network drive rather than a locally attached drive, but it doesn't recognize the existing backups (it wants to start over).  I'm not afraid of the terminal... how can I get this working?  h3on edit:/h3  I got a large drive to use during the conversion, but the link below didn't help because there was no hex id to be found on my machine in the second step  :/  <answer4901> You'll need to convert your current local-style Time Machine into a sparsebundle before it will be usable in TM over the network. You'll need some temporary storage somewhere to create your converted backup into during this conversion.  I don't know the exact conversion procedure but here are some Google'd links: http://www.tidbits.com/Talk/1960br http://jason-townsend.blogspot.com/2008/08/how-to-transfer-local-time-machine.html  Something along the lines of codehdiutil convert -format UDSB/code  <answer59521> If you have Mountain Lion, you can create a sparse bundle disk image, enable owners on that image, and copy over the "Backups.backupdb" folder from your Time Machine drive into the sparsebundle image using Finder  <comment1415> Have a look @ this question : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1192/is-it-possible-to-use-time-machine-on-a-shared-usb-hardrive <comment1433> @Pierre: I found a site that describes the process, but I need about 640GB free space somewhere to do the conversion and I don't have that right now :/  http://rolf.haynberg.de/?p=83 <comment1905> You can delete your previous backups (that will be useless) before doing your fist backup over wifi... <comment1907> Ya but I don't have another disk that has enough space to copy over the old backups first so I can copy them back after I've followed the instructions on that page I linked. <comment5413> +1... sorry I haven't had a chance to mess with this yet but when I do I'll put some feedback on here.
