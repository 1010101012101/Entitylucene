Why does "Chromium Helper EH" crash when I try to launch Chromium? <body> Every time I launch Chromium, a dialog box appears almost immediately telling me that "Chromium Helper EH has unexpectedly quit." Several things don't work, including the New Tab button missing the + symbol, several keyboard shortcuts don't work, and pages don't load more than halfway. What's happening and how can I fix it?  (Extra phrases to help this show up for people searching for "Google Chrome": Google Chrome Helper EH, Google Chrome crashes.)  <answer41644> It turns out that in 10.7.3, installing Chromium/Google Chrome from another account causes this bug. Simply installing it while using the account it will be used in solves the problem. Unfortunately, no other accounts can use it.  <comment49271> Same problem here with 10.6.8. :-(  Do you have a link for this issue? <comment49301> No, I haven't been able to find it reported on any site and I haven't reported it myself. Feel free to; I'll add a link to the answer. <comment49586> Maybe this one is related: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=95037 Does not mention multiple accounts, but I'll add a link to this discussion there.
