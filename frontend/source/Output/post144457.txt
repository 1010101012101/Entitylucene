OS X keeps rebooting by itself <body> This is a bit weird to start since I work at a AAAC and should at least be able to pinpoint a cause, but:    ul liI have been having this issue for at least a year/li liIt spawns three different machines and three OSes (a 13" Mid-2010 MBA, a 13" Mid 2012 MBP and a 13" rMBP Early 2013; Mountain Lion, Mavericks and public betas of Yosemite)/li lithere are emno/em recorded kernel panics for the time it tried to restart itself/li lithe recorded kernel panics on Console are from sleep/wake issues which have plagued these units (rMBP will be asleep in my bag when I come home, gf will be listening to some tunes on JAMBOX, unit will try to come off sleep and kernel panic. every. damn. time)/li lireading the console logs has not taken me very far. I have a couple of weird messages from the last.fm client  precode07/09/14 15:53:50,193 Last.fm Scrobbler[52838]: com.apple.message.domain:            com.apple.automation.osaexecute_run com.apple.message.signature: fm.last.Scrobbler com.apple.message.signature2: com.apple.applescript com.apple.message.summarize: YES SenderMachUUID: 4AC11FC1-B379-35FD-B3C9-3CD9798522DE  /code/pre  over and over again./li liif I don't keep an app that needs confirmation to quit (iTerm, Transmission, etc), I know I'll come back to find the computer on the login screen./li liit has never happened while I'm using it, only when idle./li /ul  Can anyone shed some light on this?

What I find most puzzling other than this being set in the first place is how the hell did this I inherit this setting on a clean install I did of Mavericks. My sincere thanks for your help, guys, I'm going to sit in the corner for a while :)  <answer145334> But, I now I feel strongreally/strong dumb, after seeing you suggestion I've started googling for my issue plus log out instead of reboot and found the issue: codeautomatically log off after x minutes of inactivity/code was set to 60 minutes.

My sincere thanks for your help, guys, I'm going to sit in the corner for a while :)  <comment170153> Any console records for SMC ? What is the apple script doing ? Feel free to expand your Console record to some 50 lines just in case you missed something, around the time stamp of the event. <comment170159> While your post is fine, it does not contain enough information (full console report after wake from sleep) to answer your question. <comment170612> Are you sure it's rebooting and not just logging you out? You can run `uptime` in the Terminal to see how long the system has been running. <comment171274> While you sit there, do not forget to mark your answer as 'accepted' within a few days. ;)
