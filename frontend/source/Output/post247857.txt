com.apple.xpc.launchd Report crash process constantly shows up with high CPU <body> There is a process »Crash Report« in the Activity Monitor which uses 10-25% and constantly disappears and shows up again. When I quit it from the activity monitor it comes back right away. Also, the MacBook fan is going crazy. In the systemlog I see this entry several times per second:  precodecom.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (secagntd) Service only ran for 1 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 9 seconds. com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (secagntd) Service only ran for 1 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 9 seconds. /code/pre  There are lot of Crash Reports in the OS X Console. The Crashlog looks like this:  precodeProcess:               secagntd [1030] Path:                  /usr/local/bin/secagntd/secagntd Identifier:            secagntd Version:               ???

How do I get rid of these Crash reports?  <answer247970> It turned out that »CleanMyMac« hasn’t completely removed all leftovers. We’ve got rid of »CleanMyMac« and manually removed the »secagntd« directory in /usr/local/bin/secagntd. Usually I don’t recommend to do any modification in /usr/local/bin, however in our case it solved the issue. CPU dropped and the constantly Crash Reports disappeared.
