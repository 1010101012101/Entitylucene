Deleting an Entire Line Moving Forward Shortcut <body> I'd simply like to know how to delete an entire line moving forward opposite of deleting an entire line backwards (cmd + delete). I know to delete individual characters moving forwards is fn + delete but what about the deleting the entire line itself?  <answer121840> You can use kbdControl ⌃/kbd-kbdK/kbd to do this. This is one of the many key bindings that OS X borrows from emacs by default. Others include kbdControl ⌃/kbd-kbdA/kbd to go to the beginning of a line, kbdControl ⌃/kbd-kbdE/kbd to go to the end of a line, and kbdControl ⌃/kbd-kbdD/kbd as an alternate forward-delete.  <comment142079> Try control+K. (I'm not posting this as an answer because I'm not sure if I added it or it's there by default). <comment142088> That did the trick! Feel free to post this as the correct answer. Thanks! <comment142090> Words can't describe just how in those 2 sentences you've made me that much more productive. =) <comment142107> Good answer +1 for a complete answer and extra awesome shortcuts!
