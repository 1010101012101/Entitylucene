How does Apple Pay work <body> Can someone give me an overview as to how Apple Pay works. What goes on inside it. What microchips are used and essentially how does it work?  <answer190279> This is a helpful description macworld article on Apple Pay in the UK  <answer190314> Here is the best write-up I know of. In typical Ars Technica fashion, it tells you everything you could ever want to know. A must-read for the curious: http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/10/how-mobile-payments-really-work/  <comment225828> Apple Pay is not a chip, it is a payment processing service.
