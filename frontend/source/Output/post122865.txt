Spotlight in Mavericks does not search Tags - how to enable? <body> I have defined a couple of tags in Mavericks. If I search inside Finder, tags work as expected:  It recognizes that "Firma" is a tag.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/J9qdK.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I select it and press enter, it turns into "Tag:Firma".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9HhgP.png" alt="enter image description here"  However if I do the same in the global search (CMD+SPACE), it seems to have no idea about tags:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SQoq2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to fix this or is it a known bug?  <answer122866> Tags have never worked that way for me. I don't know if they should, but they work for me if I prefix the tag with codetag:/code like this:  precodetag:Firma /code/pre  <answer122871> I repeated your steps in renaming one of my Tags.  My MBA with 10.9.2 does exactly the same as yours.  The Spotlight does following:  By entering the Tag name it sorts and shows the actually tagged files first in the search window.  So it knows those files were tagged by that tag.  <comment143417> If I do that, the returned result list is empty. <comment143418> That seems to be true, yes. But I thought it used to show the tag explicitly. Hmm...seems like my memory is playing tricks on me. <comment143485> Try giving your Tag a unique names (Like "-Firma-") or simular giving the Search a chance to differentiate. <comment143506> You are right. It searches for the tags but does not display it like in Finder. <comment154004> @Krumelur Same here and as detailed in [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/108076/how-to-enable-missing-tag-search-in-spotlight). Seems to be a bug or a removed feature.
