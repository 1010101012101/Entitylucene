Is there a Safari Extension for adding Mail-style Data Detectors to Web Pages? <body> I love the Data Detectors in Apple Mail. Open a message that has a date or time in the content, and creating a new Calendar event is a snap. But this feature is not in Safari, so I'm wondering if there is a way to get it in there? An extension perhaps?  <answer35855> There is the HTML code&lt;address&gt;/code-Tag and hCard, which are supported by Safari and are used for semantic data. Unfortunately, there is no data detector in Safari for those standards.  There is a workaround, until those detectors are implemented, by using "Mail Contents of This Page" from the File menu.
