Automatically remove email signatures <body> This may be somewhat of a weird question. As someone who considers email signatures as information provided in the wrong place that just clutters up my email conversations, I've been wondering if there is some plugin/app/script/whatever that automatically removes email signatures from messages I receive, reply to, or forward on macOS and/or iOS?
