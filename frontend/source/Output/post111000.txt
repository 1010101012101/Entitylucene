Buying an iPad through an iTunes account? <body> Is it possible to use the iTunes account to buy an iPad?  I'd like to build up credit using iTunes prepaid cards with 20% credit to buy a new iPad Mini Retina. I think there is no restriction to what you buy through the store.  Am I correct?  <answer111004> This assumption is wrong. You can only buy Apps from the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, and Mac App Store.  precodeAll cards work on the iTunes Store, App Store, iBooks Store, and Mac App Store.  Select the gift card that's perfect for your lucky recipient. You can include a personal message, and you always get free shipping. /code/pre  Source
