External HDD can be seen in Disk Utility but not in Finder <body> I've been using my external HDD a lot of times before on my Macbook Pro 13" OS X version 10.9.5, but it doesn't seem to appear in my Finder anymore. It can be seen in Disk Utility, though. Can anyone help?  I've already checked the codeFinder &gt; Preferences &gt; .../code And, I've already run codeRepair Disk/code and clicked on codeMount/code, to no avail. I don't want to reformat the disk because it has years of files and pictures.  This is the info on my external HDD:  precodeName :  HW Drive Type :  Partition  Disk Identifier :   disk1s1 Mount Point :   Not mounted File System :   Windows NT Filesystem (Tuxera NTFS) Connection Bus :    USB Device Tree :   IODeviceTree:/PCI0@0/EHC2@1A,7 Writable :  Yes Capacity :  320.07 GB (320,071,884,800 Bytes) Owners Enabled :    No Can Turn Owners Off :   No Can Be Formatted :  Yes Bootable :  No Supports Journaling :   No Journaled :     No Disk Number :   1 Partition Number :  1 /code/pre  <answer149076> As I said in a comment above, it seems the “Mount” action silently failed. I assume from the mention of “Tuxera NTFS” in the info on your HDD that you are using that software to get read/write support for NTFS volumes (OS X only offers read support out-of-the-box). The Tuxera NTFS FAQ says:     The most common reason why Tuxera NTFS for Mac doesn’t mount an NTFS volume is that it contains errors or inconsistencies. [...]      To recover from this situation, attach the drive to a Windows computer and run ‘chkdsk /f’ on the drive to repair any problems in its internal structures. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265 for usage information regarding ‘chkdsk’.   <answer211926> Okay, under FinderPreferencesSidebarDEVICES"Whatever the name of your Mac may be" Click that box to show in finder. Now click on it from Finder, again it'll be under devices and it'll be whatever you named your Mac(Mine is, "Kevin's Macbook Pro". Now you should see your External Drive like usual!   <answer222950> If the hard drive is showing up in Disk Utilities:  ul liIn Finder click on codeGo To/code — codeGo To Folder/code and enter code/Volumes/code/li liIf your external drive is showing up there drag it to the emdevices/em-section in the Finder-sidebar where your other devices (e.g. CD/DVD-drive are)/li liYou may need to tick codeexternal harddrives/code in codeFinder settings/code — codeSidebar/code before/li /ul  <answer223868> My bro did some clicking after that he says the Seagate 1 TB Backup Plus external hard drive was showing up in finder and desktop on his MacBook Pro. He did say it could be due some software corruption because he clicked something and probably something got installed. He doubted the Seagate dashboard.  Below are the troubleshooting steps that resolved the issue:  ol liChecked the same external seagate 1TB on another mac thin air system and the harddrive was working fine./li liChecked a different seagate external hard drive on the Mac pro notebook and the external drive is not showing up in the finder or on desktop./li liChecked in Finder preferencesGeneraland ensured that "external disks" is checked under (show these items on the desktop./li liChecked the disk utility on the MacBook Pro and the external drive is detected however it is not mounted./li lias per customer input suspected could be some hard drive application that is causing, removed the seagate dashboard application however, still same./li liThen checked for other unknown application related to hard drive. Found "Paragon NTFS" in the system preferences (my external hard drives are formatted with ntfs)./li liUninstalled the third party Paragon NTFS application(Possibly supplied with the Seagate Dashboard Software). /li liRestarted my computer./li /ol  Voila!! My external hard drives are back in finder and desktop.  <answer261209> Do a Search on Mac (Command + Space Bar), Type in "Paragon" it should load:  ul liParagon NTFS for Mac OSX/li liClick it, the bottom of that should say "System Preferences"/li liDouble Click that, it should lead you to its setting/li liCheck the "Turn the Paragon NTFS for Mac OSX Driver off"/li liUnplug your USB from the MAC/li liPlug your USB back into the MAC/li /ul  <answer268200> The only thing that worked for me was  ol liconnect the hard drive to a Windows computer. Then just plug it in your Mac, no problem./li liturn off and on Spotlight through the Terminal. This works 100% as well./li /ol  <answer288782> This fixed mine:  In strongFinder/strong:br  strongFinderPreferencesSidebarDEVICES/strongbr Then I unchecked and re-checked (deselected and then reselected) strong"Hard Disks"/strong and they came back. (even though they were external) Basically try unchecking and checking them all.  I'm also now running disk checks.  <comment175587> The info says “Not mounted”, which explains why it doesn't show up in the Finder. So the question is why it didn't get mounted why you clicked “Mount”. It seems strange that it would fail without Disk Utility showing an error message. You could check whether its log (accessible from the Window menu in Disk Utility) has additional information. Otherwise you may need to ask the developer of Tuxera NTFS why the mounting action might “silently” fail. <comment175674> Maybe the drive failed?  Have you run any hardware tests on it?  I recommend SMART Utility(it will need SAT SMART driver installed to support external drives, if yours is supported.) <comment176947> Strangely enough, when I ran it on Windows, the disk seems perfectly fine! <comment176963> But it still doesn’t work on the Mac? I’m not sure what else to suggest then other than that you could try to temporarily uninstall Tuxera NTFS (or try on another Mac) and check whether OS X’s out-of-the-box NTFS support does allow mounting the drive, or contact the Tuxera development team for more information. <comment191365> @Heini Did you checked it with chkdsk as Rinzwind suggested? Mac is not best tool to repair Windows filesystem. It is better to do it from Windows. Check it with Fix flag and post log here <comment219967> I had the same problem. Mount said the disk needed to be repaired, repair said it was dead and to retrieve anything if it was visible (which it wasn't) and format the drive. I tried this a few times on 2 different macs - then on the last try I clicked 'Eject' from inside Disk Utility and then unplugged/plugged it back in and it worked. I wouldnt have thought this would have made a difference - but it worked once so as a last stitch effort it may be useful to anyone else who found themselves here via google. <comment255904> OP said he'd already checked Finder prefs. & the drive is clearly not mounted `Mount Point :   Not mounted`
