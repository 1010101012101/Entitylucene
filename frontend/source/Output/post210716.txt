Applescript: Automatically check and remount server volume stopped working <body> Yesterday, I found a script that makes my Mac (MacBook Pro running El Capitan) automatically check for a volume on a server and remount it if the connection drops. I adapted it slightly to this, so my media server would remount when it drops (which is frequently):  precodeon idle     tell application "Finder"         set isConnected to disk "Plex" exists     end tell     if isConnected = false then         try             mount volume "Plex" on server "smb://USER:PASSWORD@192.168.0.10:445"         end try     end if     return 5 end idle /code/pre  I saved the script as a Script Editor app using the "Stay open after run handler" option, so it runs in the background.   Yesterday it worked fine. Today, when it attempts to remount the Plex volume I get a "There was a problem connecting to the server" error.  However, I can connect to the server using the 'Connect to Server' command by entering the same IP address, user ID and password.  I'm logging into the NAS with an admin account, so there shouldn't be any disk permission issues.  Is there something in the script I've scrambled, or is this an issue with the Mac or NAS?   I'm completely new to scripting, so I may ask for clarifications on any answers.  I would like to include a link to the original script, but I can't recall where I found it.  Thanks.  <answer210811> AppleScript can be a bit buggy. Recently, I've had a few scripts that were bugging out for no apparent reason. I made a small change, saved, then undid the change, and saved it again, and the problem went away... Until it came back a week or so later (an old, recurring problem). I'm not entirely certain if that will fix it in your case, but one point of note: You don't need to specify the port number at the end of the domain name or IP address, if the port is the default for the protocol. Port 445 is the default for SMB. You can remove the entire ":445" part. With unreliable languages, you never know what might fix your issue.  <answer210960> I managed to solve this problem by 'borrowing' some code from a blog I found.  precodeon idle     set intnt to do shell script "ping -c 1 192.168.0.10; echo -n"     set paras to number of paragraphs in intnt     if paras &lt; 5 then     else         set serverIP to "smb://192.168.0.10/Plex"         set UserAccount to "[USERNAME]"         set ServerPassword to "[PASSWORD]"         set serverVolume to UserAccount         tell application "Finder"             try                 if disk serverVolume exists then                 else                     mount volume serverIP as user name UserAccount with password ServerPassword                 end if             end try         end tell     end if     return 5 end idle /code/pre  I also found that if you add this code to the end of an app's info.plist file, its icon doesn't appear on the Dock.   Just copy-and-paste these lines before the final /dict entry.  Downside is I have to use Activity Manager or Terminal to kill the app, but it makes for a tidier Dock.  precode&lt;key&gt;LSUIElement&lt;/key&gt; &lt;true/&gt; /code/pre  <comment254572> Thanks. I tried the removing the "445" reference, but that didn't squash the bug.
