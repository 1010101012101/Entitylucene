How to delete a song from inside an iPod? <body> My girlfriend has an iPod Nano (3G) and she asked me how she can delete a song from inside iPod.   I didn't find any option inside the device, is it really like that? Can I delete songs only using iTunes?  <answer11414> Correct, on a stock iPod that is non jail broken, you can only delete music via iTunes.  <comment11929> If it is allowed by site rules, can you tell me more about jail broken iPod? <comment52554> JailBreaking isn't for iPod Nanos.
