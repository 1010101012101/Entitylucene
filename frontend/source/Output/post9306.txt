How to ignore specific MacOS software updates? <body> There are some software updates I'm not interested in, either because I don't use the applications involved or because I don't care.br I uncheck them and click kbdNot now/kbdbr The annoying part is that they keep popping up every time there's a new update.br Can't you uncheck them forever so the updates-to-ignore list doesn't keep growing? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxVrt.png" alt="enter image description here"  For example, I couldn't care less about stability when emsending slideshows from iPhoto'11 to iDVD/em, something I don't do anyway.  <answer9308> Try using the command "softwareupdate --ignore" in terminal. You can first start with a "softwareupdate -l" to get the actual names of the updates (usually something like iPhoto-9.1...) and then use the ignore command to stop them from showing up.  To see everything that binary can do, try running "man softwareupdate".  <answer9310> Just go up to the menu bar and hit UpdateIgnore Update (or the keyboard shortcut is apparently just the delete key).  <answer9348> Alternatively, you could delete the applications and Apple won't try to update them anymore.
