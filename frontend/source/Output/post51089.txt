How can I change a section's title color by editing the template in iBooks Author? <body> I'm trying to make a book with iBooks Author on my Mac by customizing the "Contemporary" template. When I switch the view mode from landscape to  portrait, the section title color is red - I want it green!  Since I can edit the section title in landscape mode I can't understand why I'm not able to edit its color as well.  Am I missing something?  <answer89762> The layouts easily editable when using the graphical interface of iBooks Author.   Close any documents you may have open to avoid confusion and then open a new document from the template chooser. Start with a template you like and …  ul listrongView/strong menu - strongShow Layouts/strong/li limake your changes to fonts, colors, layout, etc… on each type of page, working your way down the list./li listrongFile/strong menu - strongSave as Template…/strong/li /ul  At that point, save it in the default location and when you start a new document, you can choose your custom layout for starting a new book.
