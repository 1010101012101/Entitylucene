Finder doesn't show "Open With" menu, just "Fetching..." <body> When I rightclick a file in Finder and hover over "Open With" (e.g. I have .mp3 files associated with VLC but sometimes want to open them with Audacity or iTunes, and then use "Open With"; or want to use LibreOffice for a spreadsheet file instead of Numbers), the "Open With" menu doesn't open and just shows, greyed-out: "Fetching..." and the menu with different apps doesn't appear, even when I wait for minutes. How can this be fixed?  P.S. I searched for previous posts about this problem and could only find &quot;Fetching...&quot; Behavior in Finder &quot;Open With&quot; Menu in Yosemite but that is more about Finder taking a few seconds delay for the pop-up menu to appear, while mine doesn't appear at all.  <answer273052> It might be time to rebuild your LaunchServices database.br You will need to reset any custom associations.  The simplest method to do this is using Onyx (freeware).  Maintenance tab/Rebuilding  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iayil.png" alt="enter image description here"
