Access Exchange's public folders in Mail app on Lion? <body> Lion's Mail app smoothly setup my connection to our company's Exchange server. However I cannot see the pubic folders anywhere. Any hints how I can integrate them into Mail?  <answer38817> Krumelur  Mail.app used to be able to see Public Folders on Exchange, but no longer has this ability.  Outlook 2011 and Entourage both support this feature.  <comment43946> Outlook 2011 for Mac has a bug that brings down our Exchange server. It keeps polling it several times per second. Entourage is discontinued, isn't it? <comment43947> Yes Entourage is discontinued, it was replaced by a full version of Outlook in the lastest Mac Office release.  I know quite a few people still using Entourage on older versions of Office
