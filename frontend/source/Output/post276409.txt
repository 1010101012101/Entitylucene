Mac Pro 2008 Install New OS <body> I have a Mac Pro 2008 with a blank drive. I need to install an os as a grey flashing folder with a question mark appears. However, when I tried to make a usb drive with OS Mountain Lion it didn't work.  <comment347866> Can't make this an answer, because people insist it can be done... but from my not inconsiderable experience, you can boot it from a DVD/CD, or by putting a fresh boot drive in another slot & working from there. USB doesn't work & it's too old to use Internet Recovery. <comment347868> @Tetsujin "people insist it can't be done"? DVDs used to be the only way to install OSs <comment347873> @NoahL - true, yet I've seen so many claims to boot an 'older Mac' usually without mentioning the specific model, that I can't argue.. I never managed it.. & my 08 is still running strong here. <comment347874> I had the same problem with my 09 (firmware 5,1). Ended up using Target Disk Mode and installing from a different Mac. Actually, that's not a bad idea if OP has access to a second Mac. <comment348028> Hi, I ended up purchasing the install disk from the apple store and It worked fine <comment348044> Oh, that's another way to do it. I forgot to mention, if you take your computer into the Apple Store, they'll do an OS install on it for free. But at least this way if you need to reinstall again you have the disk
