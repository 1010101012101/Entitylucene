I can't install Soundflower. Instead it installs SoundFlowerBed. Why? <body> I'm on El-Capitan 10.11.6.  I'm trying to record a video (with audio) off my MacBook using strongSoundflower/strong. I have done this successfully before on a different Mac. But I'm having trouble repeating it on my current Mac.  When I try to install SoundFlower, instead it installs something called SoundFlowerBed. What is that? Why won't it install SoundFlower? When I click the icon in the Menu Bar, it says "SoundFlower is not installed").   strongHow can I install SoundFlower so that I can pipe the output of my soundcard back into the input for recording??/strong   See screenshot below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oBeF2.png" alt="enter image description here"  Also in System Preferences - Sound, there are no SoundFlower devices.
