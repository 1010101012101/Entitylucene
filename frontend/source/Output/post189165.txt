Bought song on iTunes on iPhone, sync'd to iTunes computer, now won't play on iPhone? <body> I bought two albums today on my iPhone, on my Apple ID, downloaded them to the iPhone, I then sync'd the phone this afternoon.   Now the albums will not show on my iPhone and it's saying that they're associated with a different Apple ID?  Which it can't be since I haven't changed it?  <answer189239> I think you should sign out of the appstore, then sign in again. Then, don't use syncing, just re-download the songs from the emPurchased/em section.
