application for iPhone to read bar codes <body> I need to read different bar codes, and would be great that I can use my iPhone for that.  Currently I have an application to read QRCodes but I'm looking to read PDF417 too.  <answer3232> Red Laser has just updated to read more types of barcode. Plus it's free.  <answer3235> I usebr RedLaser for "normal" codes and ZBar for QRCodes.  These are the fastest and most stable I could find. Plus, they are both free.  <comment256369> RedLaser vs Barcode Scanner, how do you decide? <comment256370> Why do I hear RedLaser everywhere these days? Is it the default app for QR reading now?
