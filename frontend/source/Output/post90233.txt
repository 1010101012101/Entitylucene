Not receiving email from a specific person <body> I have 3 apple devices: iPhone, iPad, Macbook pro, all receiving emails from the same provider. When one specific friend of mine sends me an email, I receive it on the iPhone and iPad, but not on the Macbook.   What could the problem be and how can I fix it?  Many thanks.  <comment105907> Who is your mailprovider and what type of mail protocol do you use (IMAP, POP etc) and what s the sending email client? <comment105909> Did you check your junk folder on the Mac? Did you check your mail rules? <comment105917> Yes and yes ... :-( <comment105944> Did you accidentally block that sender? Check under junk mail settings, blocked senders in outlook. assuming you use outlook), if not please specify. <comment105983> Where do your emails come from, Gmail, MSN-Hotmail or others...
