Where is the autoexpect command line tool on OSX Mountain Lion (10.8.5) <body> On a fresh OSX 10.8.5 install, I was surprised to find no codeautoexpect/code tool.  Where'd it go?  <answer103226> To install codeautoexpect/code you can install the homebrew version of codeexpect/code:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" brew tap homebrew/dupes brew install expect /code/pre  <comment180903> expect appears to have been disappeared from brew, or moved to "dupes". :( <comment180907> Ah looks like you're right. I must've already had `homebrew/dupes` tapped on the machine I tested it on. <comment180922> Well, at least it works. Now I have 2 copies of expect, but that's okay. <comment180937> Yeah, for whatever reason the apple packaged one does not have the autoexpect tool.  If you need the stock version of `expect` for whatever reason, you can always use `/usr/bin/expect`.   The one installed by homebrew gets a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/expect` to the `brew --cellar` path.  So depending on your bash `$PATH` variable, the homebrew one will usually be found first in the path, but you can always access the old expect from its absolute path: `/usr/bin/expect`
