Google Chrome on Mac: how to force link to open in new window (not new tab)? <body> How can I get links (boh from web pages within Chrome AND from external apps) to open in a new window rather than in a new tab in the active window?  This has been answered for Windows, but I cannot find a solution for Mac.  <answer48729> On Mac, kbdShift/kbd + left click open a link on webpage in a new window.  <comment55793> I found this for external links, this solution works: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/9500/how-to-make-chrome-open-a-new-window-for-external-links <comment65390> Shift+left click to open a link in a new window only works for links in the Chrome browser. Not from links in external applications
