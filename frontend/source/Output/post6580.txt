How to make preview jump to a specific line on startup <body> I am using TexLipse for working with latex, producing pdfs as output. I have configured it to use preview as viewer using this command line:  precodeopen -a "/Applications/Preview.app" %fullfile /code/pre  Where code%fullfile/code is the name of the file to be opened. TexLipse supports the adding of a code%line/code argument, that can be passed to the viewer to make it jump to the position where the cursor in the editor is at. However, I could not find a way or any documentation on how to pass that argument to preview. Can anyone explain how to achieve this? Is it even possible?  <answer6585> Not possible with Preview. It can go to a specific page, but that's as close as you can get. And I doubt that's baked into the CL access.  You can get the free Adobe Reader for Mac here. It must be able to do this...  <answer6601> It is possible with Preview.app but it wasn't designed for this so it is a bit of a hack.  Turn on GUI scripting, then make a script that simulates pressing the down arrow, then call that script n times.  <answer6602> If you are working with LaTeX, you should use Skim.app not Preview.app  Skim has support for moving bi-directionally between LaTeX source and the PDF, strongto a specific line/strong in either the source or PDF file.
