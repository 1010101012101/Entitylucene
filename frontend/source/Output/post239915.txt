alternative to Dterm for quick terminal <body> I love Dterm but it is no longer maintained.  Is there an alternative? I also use Alfred's term launcher and iTerm but those are not as efficient for context sensitive one liners.  <answer274588> There's a DTerm fork maintained by muhqu on GitHub. I'm using it on Sierra and it works well.  Repo here: https://github.com/muhqu/dterm  <comment294634> I am flagging to close as off-topic because this question is a request to find software. Instead, ask this at [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/), keeping the rules of [ask] in mind. <comment294646> @TheBro21 we allow software recommendation questions here.
