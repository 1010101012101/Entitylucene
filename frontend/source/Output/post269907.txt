I want to create a simple key-pressing program... (Apple Script) <body> So, I want to make a script that lets me repeat "R" a few times, and the holds (rapidly taps) "Shift." The process repeats itself.  Could someone tell me how to code such a thing?  <comment339133> If you can adapt the answers or come up with some details to make this materially different than the other question, I'm happy to reopen the question here. AppleScript is totally on topic, but you'll want to show the code you have to avoid having questions close as duplicates from other questions like "I don't know where to start..." since those all are the same question. <comment339134> Oh, I had no idea it was the same exact question... Oops
