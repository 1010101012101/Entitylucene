"Use Option as Meta key" with ability to type the # symbol <body> I am using Terminal version 2.5, where I have two requirements:  ol liI need to be able to type the code&lt;META&gt;/code key./li liI need to be able to type the code#/code character./li /ol  How can I satisfy both of these? By default, (2) is satisfied, but (1) is not. I can then turn on "Use Option as Meta key", which satisfies (1), but breaks requirement (2).  How can I have both? (It shouldn't be so hard for me to just be able to emtype/em.)  emEdit:/em what I'm looking for, for example, might be a way to just "Use Option as Meta key" for the left/right Option key, or a way to override the "Use Option as Meta key" for the sole exception of the code#/code character.  <answer156166> iTerm 2 can be configured to only use one option key as meta:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pQ2Cc.png" alt=""  <answer156203> For requirement 2 you can choose to make the keyboard an Australian one. The only difference between UK and Australian i kbdalt/kbdkbd3/kbd and kbdshift/kbdkbd3/kbd. For UK they give # and Â£ and vice versa for Australian. This means that for an Australian keyboard # is kbdshift/kbdkbd3/kbd as it is for a US or under Windows or Linux.  To change the keyboard layout (under Yosemite)  got System Preferences-Language &amp; region - hit the Keyboard Preferences button and use + to add Austrailian  to the left hand column  <answer188066> I finally figured out how to do this by code:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30336086/make-shift3-produce-not-%C2%A3-on-osx-by-code  If you have developer tools, you can compile &amp; run that from the commandline.  <comment183667> idk whether it will fix your specific requirement, but Karabiner is a popular tool for that kind of thing - https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ <comment183678> Which keyboard do you have as on US ones shift 3 is # <comment183702> @Mark UK layout <comment183704> Thanks. I found that iTerm's behavior here is somehow buggy; it stopped treating Option as Meta at some point during a session. In the meantime, I've switched to using a graphical version of Emacs which fixes my problem.
