Hide iPad mail icon without jailbreaking <body> I need a way to hide the mail icon on an iPad as my business the emails need to be secured. I know you can jailbreak the device and achieve it but this is not viable for me.  <answer139396> You can use restrictions in settings, but if you do you cannot access mail without re-enabling it. To enable restrictions go to settings, general, restrictions and tap on enable restrictions.  <comment164382> You can't restrict Mail using iOS restrictionsâ€¦?
