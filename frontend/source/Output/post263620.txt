Unable to connect to particular website <body> I've got a huge problem: I can't connect to some websites from all of my devices connected to my Wi-Fi network.   I tried so far:  ul liFlushing DNS/li liUsing Google DNS/li liRebooted and reset the router/li liChecked hosts/li licleared the browsers caches/li liinstalled, checked and deinstalled anti-virus/li liChecked any host conflicts with MAMP Pro/li liReset MAMP Pro ports/li /ul  When I try to ping the website, I promptly get request timeouts. The tracing stops somewhere in nowhere.  Some things I did, before the website stopped working:  ul liInstalled and deinstalled VPN-Tunnel (Tunnelblick)/li liGenerated new SSH-Key/li /ul  I´m using a MBP, late 2013, El Capitan.   Already tried most of the solutions for similar questions, no success.  Any ideas what I can do?  <comment330298> Thank you, you are right. The website is not local, it is a unpublished project of a client, so i am not able to share the specific website, but the website works for everyone else.  And yes, what i meant was: "I can't connect to some websites from all of my devices connected to my Wi-Fi network", thank you. I´ll correct the question. <comment330299> You say it is not local but it is unpublished... is it hosted on a remote server? Also you mentioned before that you could access it through your iPhone over the mobile network but not over Wi-Fi. So does it work with some devices on your local network just not your Macbook Pro and iPhone? <comment330300> Do you use the latest MAMP Pro (4.0.6) which (afaik) includes a DNS server? Do you also host (as developer of the project) the website locally? Ping timeout usually indicates either that the source host has no route to the destination host, or the destination host's reply is blocked by a firewall. Other less common reasons may also apply. <comment330302> @alistair-mcmillan It is not local, with unpublished i meant "not public" and in development. It is hosted on a remote server and everyone, who has the link (except for me) can open the website. And yes, it works over the mobile network (even when I open a hotspot and open it on my macbook). <comment330303> @Eric If you try to access the website with just the IP address on your Macbook Pro and iPhone over Wi-Fi do you get to the site (or at least the server, in the case that the one server might be hosting multiple sites) okay, or does it similarly timeout? <comment330304> @klanomath yes, I use the latest MAMP Pro, but the DNS server is not active. And no, I don´t host the website locally (i wish, i would, but it isn´t possible at the moment).  I have no firewall active and i normally have connection to this website. <comment330305> @AlistairMcMillan i looked up the IP over the Network Utility and tried this before- but i still get a request timeout. <comment330307> @Eric Is MAMP Pro installed on your Macbook Pro or on the remote server? <comment330310> @AlistairMcMillan installed on my Macbook. But I can´t imagine that MAMP has anything to do with that, because i also get a request timeout on my iPhone, when connected to Wifi.
