No boot partition <body> I have deleted my recovery partition and now i am not able to boot. I am writing this question from internet recovery. To get the hole picture of my current status please look at my previous qusetion here:  Can&#39;t install Sierra on triple boot MacBook Pro with rEFInd  After installing Sierra i have tried to resize my partition but not able to resize it. So i tried to remove recovery partition. I was thinking i should be able to boot even if i remove recovery. I was wrong :)  Now what can i do to boot my Mac again?
