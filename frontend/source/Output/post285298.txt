Finding the folder a note is stored in in Notes <body> This seems so basic, but just can't figure it:  I can easily find a note with an unique bit of text, but finding WHERE in my list of folders the note is stored seems impossible. One would think that when you tap a found note, the note's folder would become highlighted, or at least a tooltip would help identify the location, but no such luck.  Tips, thoughts? thx.. drew..  <answer285303> Prior to High Sierra, you can drag the note over the list of folders in the sidebar. Each folder will highlight blue as you hover with the note, except AllÂ iCloud, Recently Deleted and most importantly the folder already containing the note.  Since High Sierra, the folder is shown beside the note.     img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0uWW6.png" width="394"   https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/high-sierra-preview/  <answer292983> This works on 10.12.6 Sierra: Search for the note, select it, then clear the search field. The folder will be highlighted in light gray.  <comment359765> You cannot drag notes from the search results window, so this doesn't work. <comment359766> @drew Once you've cleared your search, the last highlighted note remains highlighted, so you can still find it and then drag it. <comment359920> Thank you.. that did it, although it is great for only ONE note in a sequence. Very unlike Apple to be so illogical. Each click on a found note should highlight the location, not force us to close down the search to see where it is. But.. thank you. <comment362633> @drew I've edited my answer, it's in the next version of macOS.
