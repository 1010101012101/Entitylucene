remove all alarms of all overdue reminders with AppleScript on OS X <body> I want to remove all alarms / notifications (there may be none, one or more than one) of all overdue reminders in the Reminders app of OS X.  I tried to use AppleScript for this, but having troubles understanding how to properly work with emobjects/em. I figured out how to get all those reminders, though:  precodetell application "Reminders"     activate     set myRemList to every reminder whose due date is less than (current date) as list     repeat with myitem in myRemList         log (get properties of myitem)     end repeat end tell /code/pre  Is this code usable (any fatal mistakes I'm not aware of)? How can I remove the alarms?  [Edit]  Here's an example of what I want to achieve:  Consider this one which reminds me to call Jon Doe:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P69DI.png" alt="enter image description here"  The item is due today and a reminder is set to notify me at 14.00 (2 pm). When my planning has changed there are few of those items, popping up their reminders ("call jon doe" in this example). I want that "remind me" property to be unticked for all overdue items.  <answer252033> There was no fatal mistake in the emcode/em shown in the OP, however the proper way to use codecurrent date/code, in this case, is by letting the current application do it, not Reminders, as it actually errors out but does recover, hence not fatal. Nonetheless one should write emcode/em that's not going to needlessly error out. So, before the codetell application "Reminders"/code emcode block/em, set codecurrent date/code to a emvariable/em and use the emvariable/em within the emReminders code block/em, as shown in the emcode/em further below.  Note that I personally do not use the Reminders app, however going by what's exposed in Reminders's AppleScript Dictionary, the following emproperties/em, not marked ascoder/o/code, are what can be programmatically changed for the codereminder/code emclass/em.     strongname/strong (text) : the name of the reminder br   strongid/strong (text, r/o) : the unique identifier of the reminder br   strongbody/strong (text) : the notes attached to the reminder br   strongcompleted/strong (boolean) : Is the reminder completed? br   strongcompletion date/strong (date) : the completion date of the reminder br   strongcontainer/strong (list, r/o) : the container of the reminder br   strongcreation date/strong (date, r/o) : the creation date of the reminder br   strongdue date/strong (date) : the due date of the reminder br   strongmodification date/strong (date, r/o) : the modification date of the reminder br   strongremind me date/strong (date) : the remind date of the reminder br   strongpriority/strong (integer) : the priority of the reminder br   As a test, I created a reminder named "Test" and set the strongremind me [âˆš]/strong emcheck box/em to emyesterdays date/em, so as to conform with the emsearch parameter/em in the emcode/em further below.  Then, in Script Editor, I used the following line of emcode/em to get its emproperties/em.  precodetell application "Reminders" to get properties of reminder named "Test" /code/pre  It returned:  ul licode{due date:date "Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM", modification date:date "Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:35 PM", class:reminder, body:missing value, completed:false, completion date:missing value, id:"3F0EF538-5DF6-4F1C-8024-922B5D45EB9B", name:"Test", container:list id "9EB58C9B-EF63-4B72-88C3-A4FFA3C7272F" of application "Reminders", priority:0, creation date:date "Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:13 PM", remind me date:date "Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM"}/code/li /ul  I then manually unchecked the strongremind me []/strong emcheck box/em and ran the code... get properties .../code emcode/em again.  It returned:  ul licode{due date:missing value, modification date:date "Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:35 PM", class:reminder, body:missing value, completed:false, completion date:missing value, id:"3F0EF538-5DF6-4F1C-8024-922B5D45EB9B", name:"Test", container:list id "9EB58C9B-EF63-4B72-88C3-A4FFA3C7272F" of application "Reminders", priority:0, creation date:date "Sunday, September 11, 2016 1:49:13 PM", remind me date:missing value}/code/li /ul  The primary difference between the two was the first and last emitems/em in the emlist/em, i.e., the codedue date/code and the coderemind me date/code, went from codedue date:date "Saturday, September 10, 2016 2:00:00 PM"/code to codedue date:missing value/code with the same for coderemind me date/code, having coderemind me date:missing value/code too.  So I tested the emcode/em below using both empreferences/em, codedue date/code and coderemind me date/code just to see if there was any difference and there wasn't, as removing one removed the other.  The following emcode/em strongwill remove both the codedue date/code and coderemind me date/code/strong from any Reminder that's older then codecurrent date/code and has not been marked codecompleted/code, at the time the emcode/em is run, as this is what occurs, at least to the emproperties/em of a codereminder/code, in one has manually unchecked the strongremind me []/strong emcheck box/em.  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset curDate to current date  tell application "Reminders"     activate     set myRemList to every reminder whose due date is less than curDate as list     repeat with myitem in myRemList         if completed of myitem is false then             delete remind me date of myitem         end if     end repeat end tell /code/pre  hr  The emcode/em above can also be written as shown below. This actually is a better way to write it, as it makes for a smaller emlist/em returned because it's then only creating a list of emitems/em (codereminders/code) that have not yet been marked as  emcompleted/em. As after all, ones already marked as emcompleted/em are not going to trigger an "alarm".  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeset curDate to current date  tell application "Reminders"     activate     set myRemList to every reminder whose completed is false and due date is less than curDate as list     repeat with myitem in myRemList         delete remind me date of myitem     end repeat end tell /code/pre  hr  Based upon your edited OP, if this does not do what is needed, then I do not know what else I can offer, as I can only work within what emproperties/em are exposed and editable.  Note: I was not able to reproduce the reminder as shown in your edit, i.e. the line starting with "due" directly under the strong[] At a Location/strong emcheck box/em and above "repeat strongNone/strong". However, what is now offered as the answer to "remove all alarms of all overdue reminders with AppleScript on OS X" does mimic the manual action of unchecking the strongremind me []/strong emcheck box/em, which is what you've now asked for through the edit made to the OP. I hope this resolves your issue.  <comment313373> Have you tried just running that code? There's nothing in there that will cause the system to explode; all it's doing is logging properties. <comment313744> @tubedogg yes, but it's only the beginning as it does not what I want to achieve: removing the alarms of the reminders <comment313745> great, good to know, thank you! do you know additionally know how to just remove the alarms of the reminders (instead of deleting them)? <comment313755> @muffel, Here's the issue... Personally I do not use the Reminders app and I can only go by what's exposed in the AppleScript Dictionary of the target App. The Reminders's AppleScript Dictionary doesn't expose a property named "alarm", or similar, for the properties of the `reminder` _class_. So I'm not sure to what you're referring, sorry. <comment313853> thanks again! I edited my question in order to show what I exactly want to achieve, please have a look. <comment313901> I have now updated my answer, hopefully addressing the need/want expressed in your edited OP. Let me know if it works for you. <comment314983> Did my updated answer resolve your issue? <comment315137> works for me, thank you very much!
