To see who is using what run  precodelsof -i -P /code/pre  <comment186298> Even i had my browsers exited (Command-q) but the connection would still show up. <comment186299> run lsof -i -P  to see who is using what connection <comment186302> `lsof -i:https -P` will limit the display to https connections (or more accurately, those on port 443), so you won't have as much to looks through. <comment186308> @GordonDavisson a nice one :) found multiple deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com:443 suckers !
