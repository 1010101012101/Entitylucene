Missing songs don't add from iCloud Music <body> How can I download some staff, that has codeadd/code link, which don't work properly? I'm trying to redownload, testing on different albums - not help (but not every album has such problem, frequently all tracks are on there places). Not working in mac iTunes, iPhone &amp; iPad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cg89N.png" alt="enter image description here"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SrvLI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer198119> Today I suddenly understand... I cannot add these missing files because I have already them in other albums. Maybe it's a big problem for someone, but I just delete albums that are "no so good" and keep "that really rock". So problem solved! Thanks for watching!
