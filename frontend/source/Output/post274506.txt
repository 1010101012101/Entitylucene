flashing question mark icon error / Cable Error? <body> My macbook air (mid 2011 ) gives flashing question mark icon error. (Sorry my bad Eng.) I got flashing question mark in folder icon error when I want to turn on it and no apple icon appeared (white screen). Then I shut down and press again power button, sometimes it turns on and sometimes it doesnt. For example, it doesnt turn on 30 minutes and I got flashing question error. If it turns on, I can restart and turn on every timeâ€“ no problem. But if I shut down it normally at OS, cycle start and sometimes it turns on and sometimes it doesnt. I must shut down it because I work freelance sometimes in office sometimes in home.  Also, my battery is dead and my macbook air only works max. 10 minutes with only battery / no charge. And it gave "service the battery" message.  What will be the problem? Can it be wire connection problem or battery problem? I read some blogs that it may be occurred because of wire connection problem. They suggest that open your macbook's screws and control the wire connections.  Note: -I checked the driver error at disk utility , no problem.  Thanks, Serkan  <comment345151> There's a lot of questions on this site about the flashing question mark error.
