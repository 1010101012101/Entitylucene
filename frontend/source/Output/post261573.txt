How do you install playground books on iPad? <body> I found a playground book from Apple online called "Talking To The Live View". It's an updated playground from the 2016 WWDC. I want to install it on my iPad and try it out. Further, I want to experiment with building my own playground books and installing them on my iPad.  I'm a licensed iOS developer, and know how to install apps on iOS devices, but despite searching for a couple of hours I have not been able to figure out how to install playground books onto my iPad other than the ones that magically get listed from Apple.  <answer261576> Ok, it turns out that if you use AirDrop to send the Playground book to yourself, iOS offers to open it in the Swift Playgrounds app.  <comment327545> Have you seen [this Playground Book article](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-swift-playground-books/) from Ash Furrow?  It goes into detail on how to build the books. <comment327555> Glad the article helped!
