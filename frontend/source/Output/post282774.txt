QuickLook stops for no discernible reason - how to find culprit? <body> Just recently, it appears that QuickLook simply stops functioning after some time.    I'm not certain, but I suspect it's perhaps due to some photographic app I've recently installed - it mainly happens when I've been using QuickLook to quickly flip through the huge stack of pictures I'm currently working on - but there have been quite a few as I'm doing a lot of research into photography right now.br It doesn't appear to happen whilst I'm using it, i.e. between one photo &amp; the next; it seems to happen when I've been off doing something else - photoshop or one of the myriad photo apps I've got right now - then come back to Finder to see generic icons in QuickLook the first time I change selection [presumably the one I first see is buffered, so I see the break on the first new selection.]  So, I'm trying to isolate the suspect.  From Is there a way to completely reset / regenerate Quick Look preferences (system-wide)? I have set up a Service I can reset QuickLook with, which works fine - until it just stops again.  QuickLook stopped working shows me how to isolate non-Apple qlplugins - however there are so many it still looks a mammoth task.  To try narrow this down further, I'm thinking I need these three approaches...  ol liIs there any way I can show these by install date?  /li liIs there a way to selectively enable/disable specific plugins so I could at least try the 'divide &amp; conquer' approach to isolate the culprit?  /li liIs there anything specific I could look at in Console which may help?/li /ol  All I can see in Console when searching quick look is    precode05/05/2017 09:11:19.683 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.quicklook[16216]) Endpoint has been activated through legacy launch(3) APIs. Please switch to XPC or bootstrap_check_in(): com.apple.quicklook /code/pre  which doesn't really tell me anything.  An alternative possibility is that it's not a new plugin, but one of my apps' output formats that could be making ql crash.br Potentially that would show in console too, but I really don't know where to start looking.  Poking at a variety of different format images just after resetting ql generated this, though right now it's still working fine, even for the image that generated the messagebr code05/05/2017 09:28:00.729 QuickLookUIHelper[16222]: HWJPEG not avaialble on this platform/code  Note that once it breaks, all filetypes show only their generic icon for QuickLook, not just pictures.
