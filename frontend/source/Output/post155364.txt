Missing .Bash Files in ~/ <body> While uninstalling/removing home-brew, node, and yeoman...I noted that I don't have a .bashrc or .bash_profile in my home directory. I only have .bash_history present.  Why is this? Is this bad? If it's bad, how can I fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YesGL.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer155365> It's not a bad thing. You don't emneed/em a .bash_profile, but if you want one, simply re-create ~/.bash_profile as an empty file.  ~/.bashrc is not sourced by default in OS X.  <comment182759> Thank you much for that. I thought something went wrong.
