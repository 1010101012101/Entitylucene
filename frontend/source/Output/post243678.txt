Duration of photos on iMovie for iPad <body> I have seen many answers to change the duration of photos on iMovie for the Mac, but none for the iPad.   I have a lot of pictures that, for some reason, have different durations on the screen (for example, some are five seconds long and some are four seconds).   I want all of my pictures to be on the screen for one second , but I cannot seem to find any solution for the iPad.  <comment300140> Hi, do you mean you want all your newly added photos' duration to be automatically set to 1s or you wish to have all your photos last 1s? **Short Question**: *You want this to be done as soon as you add photos in your Project or you want to find a way to accomplish that (manual)?*
