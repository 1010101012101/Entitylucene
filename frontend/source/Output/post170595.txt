How to make Finder remember its window size and column sizes? <body> Why doesn't OS X remember the Size of the Finder window and the size of the columns in Cover flow (or any other) view?  It seems like something very basic that should just be there but it's really frustrating when I have to continuously resize columns to see filenames and resize the window so I can see a reasonable amount of stuff.  I know there are script that can allow you to achieve this emmanually/em, but that really isn't acceptable. They've had decades to get the simple stuff right. Why doesn't this already happen by default?  <answer170600> Simplest answer to 'how' rather than 'why' is   Opt[alt] drag a column sizer. That becomes the new default.br Only works for column view, not coverflow.  Other options, though each is temporary     ul liDouble click a column sizer to set that column to show full content width./li liRight-click a column sizer for more options./li /ul  <comment200577> Do you have an actual question? Only Apple would be able to answer 'why?' <comment200706> I did. I totally forgot to ask the most important part, "How?" because I became so frustrated by the fact that they don't seem to care much for the little - but important - details.
