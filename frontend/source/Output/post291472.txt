How can i put selected images from photos app on macbook to the camera roll on iPhone 5? <body> So i import images from my dslr to the photos app on my macbook which works perfectly but I only want to put a few of them onto my phone so it appears in my camera roll. I am aware of syncing an album through Itunes however they do not appear in the camera roll.  Is there a simple method to transfer select images from photos to the camera roll?
