Can't select Time Machine disk <body> I've had Time Machine set up on my OSX Server for quite a while, but now that I upgraded my USB storage I can't seem to connect to the server. When I go to Time Machine preferences and click codeSelect Backup Disk.../code I can see the share as usual. After I select the drive, turn on encryption and click codeUse Disk/code, I get asked for my credentials. If I enter the wrong credentials, the dialog shakes as it's supposed to, but when I enter the correct username and password, I'm thrown back to the disk selection screen.  I've tried turning the Time Machine service on and off, removing and adding the backup location to the service, deleting code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code on the client, but every time the same happens. No info can be found in the console on the client, and the only possibly related lines on the server are from codekdc/code regarding encryption and this line: code26/06/17 23:24:04,130 AppleFileServer[25122]: Logged out 0x7f86da033600/code.  Any ideas would be appreciated. Screenshots here.  Almost forgot: the client is running 10.12.5, and the server is 10.10.4.
