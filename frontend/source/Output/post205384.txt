Accidentally hid a game that i bought and cant get it back <body> I bought star wars the old republic a while back, i could always see it in the purchased tab, i went on my pc then into itunes to hide some apps that i didnt want in my account and accidentally clicked star wars, now i cant get it back and it costs me! I cant find out how to put it back in the purchased tab in the appstore. I also tried to delete it and get it back but that doesnt work either.  <answer205395> First things first: Any purchased app will not cost you (a second time). Even if you ordinarily search for it and click on BUY again. If you use the same credentials you used to buy it, the App Store will recognize it and will let you download it for free.  In order to unhide any app you once purchased, you need to sign into your Apple ID account inside iTunes, then click on your account name and choose "Account Info". If yo have hidden purchases, you have a section between "Apple ID Summary" and "Purchase History" called "iTunes in the Cloud", where you can manage hidden purchases.  Once in there, choose "Apps" on the right side at the top and then look for your inadvertently hidden app to "Unhide" it.  If you bought the app for OS X, the same can be done on the App Store for OS X.
