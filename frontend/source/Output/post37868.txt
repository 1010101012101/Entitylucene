Why does Safari freeze on YouTube HTML5 videos? <body> I'm in YouTube HTML5 trial, and the experience is terrible with Safari.br Every video is lagging severely, and the browser gets unresponsive constantly.    I have zero problems with the Flash version, and Chrome handles HTML5 YouTube just fine.  Activity Monitor says strongQTKitServer - Safari Web Content/strong grabs more than 100% CPU.br Can I fix this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbPPd.png" alt="image showing 100% cpu usage"  I have 17-inch Mid 2010 MacBook Pro running Mac OS X Lion 10.7.2 with 8 GB of RAM.  <answer40770> I had a similar problem with my Safari. I went into /Library/Internet Plug-Ins and removed the two piece of Flash cruft (regretfully I'm at work, so I don't the exact file names.)  After a reboot, Safari worked much better, as did Chrome.  Not sure why Chrome improved, but it improved most of all.  Incidentally, I thought I was on a Flash free system previously, so I'm not sure how those bits got there.  If I need Flash, I just go to Develop - Open Page With - Chrome (you need to enable the Developer Menu, under Advanced in Preferences.)  Hope this help  <comment42952> You should report your experiences via the "feedback" link on that YouTube HTML5 web page. <comment42953> A bit more info on your computer could be useful too. OS version, model, year, etc. <comment42959> @bneely: thanks. I just [reported it](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/youtube/thread?tid=566399903f25d1bf&hl=en). <comment46156> Cool, thanks. I'll definitely try this out.
