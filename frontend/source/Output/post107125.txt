Mavericks Calendar sync with Google seems entirely broken? <body> In a long drawn out story that started with trying to implement CardDAV (I'd like to store my contacts on google if possible), I removed my google account from codeInternet Accounts/code, which had existed there from Mountain Lion, and was working perfectly fine for Calendar.app and Messages.app.  Upon trying to re-add the Google account and have it sync my calendars, It's telling me that it cant do it anymore. I'm using two-factor google authentication, and I provide the setup with a generated, app specific password. Contacts and Messages click instantly, but Calendars sits spinning. It eventually informs me that:     strongA secure connection couldn't be established/strong      Click "Continue" to continue creating the account.    You can edit the account later in Calendar    preferences if necessary      emCancel/em strongContinue/strong   Console informs me that:  precode28/10/2013 2:26:38.652 am com.apple.internetaccounts[13796]: [com.apple.calendar.iaplugin.log.CalInternetAccountsPlugin] [Autodiscovery error: [Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1001 "The request timed out."

I've done some digging and found these resources, although evidently they did not work for me:  ul lihttp://productforums.google.com/d/msg/calendar/7XZkRZzo10I/5oo7RReNhrAJ/li lihttps://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/caldav/v2/guide#new_endpoint/li /ul  It seems that the endpoint is no longer valid? Multiple attempts to create a CalDav account in Advanced mode attempting all flavours and variations bore no fruit.  How can I get this working again?  <answer107389> I reattempted the standard google process today, and it failed on ical (no account) but going to internet accounts and attempting to enable calendar worked.  I can only deduce some form of google services were down or misconfigured in this period.  <answer116799> Here's what worked for me:  ol liOpen Calendar.app/li liOpen Preferences (âŒ˜+,)/li liClick Accounts tab/li liClick plus button (+) to add an account/li liSelect "Add CalDAV Account..."/li liClick Continue/li liSelect "Account Type" Manual/li liUsername is your strongfull email address/strong "yourname@gmail.com"/li liPassword is your password (or application specific password if you use 2 factor auth)/li liServer Address is "https://www.google.com"/li /ol  Notes:  ol liDon't forget the "@gmail.com" on your gmail address! You can also use your own domain name if a Google Apps user/li liThe "https://" on the Server Address field is critical. Without this you will get an error about not being able to establish a secure connection (https uses SSL where http doesn't)./li /ol  <comment133802> Did you get this working? <comment133806> See the answer below :) <comment133861> Well, I had seen it, I just wondered if it had continued to work. I was having some unrelated issues last night, which is when I came upon your post. <comment206495> This solution does not work as of today. I created an application-specific password for just my calendar, followed these steps precisely, and I receive the message "Unable to verify account name or password"
