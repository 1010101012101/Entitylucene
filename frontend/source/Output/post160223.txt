Occasional low-resolution text rendering (Retina MBP running Yosemite) <body> My colleague has a 13" retina MBP running Yosemite. Text looks great on the whole, except for Finder windows opened from applications (i.e. File  Open). Using Finder from the desktop doesn't exhibit the problem.  Here's a screengrab showing the low-resolution text (this can't really be seen on a 72dpi screen without viewing the image at 1:1 -- please open the image in a new tab so it's not scaled down): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMPtV.png" alt="Fuzzy text on Yosemite"  (Note the menu bar is perfectly crisp, but the Finder window's text isn't).  Here's a screengrab of Finder launched from the desktop:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4Wke.png" alt=""  Any thoughts? I played with the font smoothing setting but that doesn't change anything (and why would it, since that's system-wide and this issue is limited to the finder window inside running applications).
