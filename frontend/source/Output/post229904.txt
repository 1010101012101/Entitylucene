How to open an encrypted dmg file in Windows? <body> I made encrypted disk image on my MacBook. Now I want to open it on my PC (Windows 10).  How can I open (mount) an encrypted dmg image file in Windows 10?  <answer229909> According to the website HFSExplorer can open and read encrypted dmg images.     HFSExplorer is an application that can read Mac-formatted hard disks and disk images.   It can read the file systems HFS (Mac OS Standard), HFS+ (Mac OS Extended) and HFSX (Mac OS Extended with case sensitive file names).      HFSExplorer allows you to browse your Mac volumes with a graphical file system browser, extract files (copy to hard disk), view detailed information about the volume and create disk images from the volume.   HFSExplorer can also read most .dmg / .sparsebundle disk images created on a Mac, including zlib / bzip2 compressed images and strongAES-128 / AES-256 encrypted images/strong. It supports the partition schemes Master Boot Record, GUID Partition Table and Apple Partition Map natively.

I opened my dmg encrypted file with it on deleted some things and that's all..  <comment280874> I tried HFSExplorer, it ask for password which I tipped and then show empty system folder (dmg image is encrypted with AES 256, and is correctly opened only with Mac OS).
