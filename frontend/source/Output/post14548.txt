Cisco AnyConnect causes OS X to kernel panic <body> My Macbook Pro 15" (Early 2011 - the one with Thunderbolt port) constantly kernel panics whenever Cisco AnyConnect establishes connection.  The panic tends to happen in the first ~30 seconds after connection is established.  The crash log is available here: https://gist.github.com/d947e73b0b6c17a863b7  Any thoughts?  Some details: Macbook Pro 15" i7 Early 2011 (the one with Thunderbolt) Cisco AnyConnect version 2.5.2019  PS. I asked this question on the Apple Support forum, but so far I have got no answer :(  strongEDIT/strong: This problem originally occurs in Snow Leopard, but problem persists in Lion (10.7), even after a fresh install (not upgrade from 10.6)  <answer48950> I've experienced the same issue on an iMac running OSX Lion (10.7.3). I submitted a bug report to Apple and tweeted at @anyconnect. You will need to work with Cisco support or use another version of the app unless we can narrow down the specific setting that is causing this crash.  <answer111757> I found a solution for this issue, and wrote about it here :  http://technie.net/kernel-panic-on-macbooks-20102011-with-cisco-anyconnect/  There's a bug in Cisco AnyConnect, but following the guide on the link, it will be able to work.  <comment15683> Do you have to use the Cisco client? While I haven't used the AnyConnect client, I did use the Cisco VPN Client and had kernel panics with it. I switched to using the built-in VPN client over a year ago and haven't had a kernel panic since then. <comment20691> @barryj: AnyConnect is using SSLVPN while the built-in VPN support only works over IPSec. I don't think I can use the built-in VPN, sadly :( <comment59107> Cisco now has at least version 3.0.5080 of AnyConnect -- any chance you can upgrade your AnyConnect client? <comment94381> Was there any resolution and information on version of AnyConnect that causes this? <comment131377> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone.
