How do I change a folder to a jar? <body> I play Minecraft like many gamers and I am trying to make a profile where I can read the enchanting table language and I cannot get it to work. How do I change the folder that I used to edit it into a jar?  <answer127920> Compress the contents of the folder then rename the .zip to .jar  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ab0AY.gif" alt=""  <answer127925> From codeterminal/code use:  codejar -cvf filename.jar ./foldername/code  codejar/code works much the same as the unix archive command codetar/code, the parameters codecvf/code mean essentially emCreate Verbosely Filename/em which will just display the contents of codefoldername/code as they are added into codefilename.jar/code.  Instead of create you can use codex/code for extract or codet/code for test extract (aka list).  <answer127977> Minecraft specifically will also recognize a codejar/code without any compression at allâ€”you can just rename your folder from (for example) code1.7.9 copy/code to code1.7.9.jar/code. I find this really useful with Minecraft since I don't have to zip and unzip every time for it to work.
