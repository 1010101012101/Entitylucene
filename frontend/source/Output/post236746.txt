Move videos from photo seems downsizing it or compressing <body> When I watch video using Photos img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C3lq4.png" alt="enter image description here" it looks good. But when I simple move video file from Photos to Desktop and watch it then it looks like it was downsized or kind of. How to export/move to desktop video as is?  <answer238006> Ok I found an option FileExportOriginal  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VO1VS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment289812> Are you speaking about playing the videos in QuickTime Player or playing using the Quickview function in the Finder (select + press Space bar)? Quickview may be playing HD videos in reduced size. <comment290362> @DictionaricsAnonymous ok let me check, so do you think is that not issue, but player optimization. Let me check in QuickTime player. <comment291725> @DictionaricsAnonymous I played in in Photos and using Quick Time and quality much better in Photos I guess much more! <comment291727> @DictionaricsAnonymous ok I found it, but thanks for help!
