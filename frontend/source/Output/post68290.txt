How do I create a link on the iPad home screen to a specific pdf? <body> I would like to be able to create a link on my iPad's home screen that will open up a specific PDF either in iBooks or some other app.  I need to be able to access the PDF even when Internet access in not available.  My iPad is used by my 3-year-old son. I want to make it just as easy for him to open up the (non-DRM) PDF picture books we have as it is to open up a random app such as Elmo ABCs.  Right now, in order to open his picture books, he has to go to iBooks and then open up the picture books.  It sounds like a small step but it isn't for him.  I've tried accessing the PDF from Safari and then choosing the "Add to Home Screen" option.  It does put an icon on the home screen but when clicked, it tries to open up the original site the PDF came from.  As a result, this isn't a good solution unless there is a way to cache the PDF locally.  I've looked in iBooks for some way to do this but nothing obvious is jumping out at me.  <answer68291> iBooks has an codeitms-books:///code URL scheme, but according to Apple (second hand via this forum post), it's only  usable for ebooks and books in the iBooks store, not arbitrary PDFs.  <answer273971> strongFirst simple way/strong, it requires Google Drive, however.  ol liOpen the iOS Google Drive app, upload your desired PDF and get the link of said PDF.  /li liOpen iOS Safari and open the link in the browser; you should now see the PDF in Safari./li liClick "Share" and then "Add to Home Screen". /li /ol  strongSecond complicated way/strong, but goes to iBook; you will need Workflow the app.  ol liGet Workflow the app; open it, create a new workflow (click plus sign)/li liFind the "action" Get File and drag it to the right "building area".   /li liIn the Get File action, uncheck "Show Document Picker"; you will see two new formlists pop up./li liIn the "iCloud File" form, type in any name, for now lets go with emname.pdf/em; it should now look like: /li /ol     strongiCloud File/strong  /Workflow/name.pdf   ol start="5" liSearch the actions again for the action "Open in iBooks" and drag it over as well./li listrongSwith to laptop (easier)/strong and you must get the desired PDF, rename it to emname.pdf/em, copy/move it to your iCloud Drive and into the Workflow folder.  em(if it doesn't exist, make a Workflow iCloud Account via the app)/em/li liGo back to the app, test the workflow we built by pressing the play button and it should open the PDF in iBook! /li liLastly, press the gear and then press "Add to Homescreen", and ta-da!

Or do you read some other books too? <comment79519> We have several picture books in iBooks.  They're all pretty short so each one doesn't occupy my son for that long. <comment79521> So you want a shortcut on the home screen for each book or just one of them? <comment79704> A shortcut for each book.  Similar to how, in Windows, you could put the file or a shortcut of the file on the desktop and it'd automatically open when clicked. <comment79707> Ah, sorry, but that’s really not possible without an internet connection. But what you want seems to be counterintuitive - iBooks app offers the same style of navigation. In fact, the cover pages are bigger in iBooks, so kids will find it easier to navigate. <comment79744> Well, I suspected it might not be possible but hoped I was over-looking something.  The problem is I'm dealing with a 3-year-old.  His first response to back out of every program is to hit the home button.  Then he needs to remember to find the iBooks icon and then go back in to find the books he wants.  In general he's pretty good navigating around but this is one area he just doesn't do as well. <comment79797> Do you know about Guided Access? It’s a really nifty feature which allows you make your iPad stay on one app even when the home button is pressed. I am sorry that there isn’t any direct solution to the problem. <comment79937> No, I'll have to check it out, thanks.
