Some apps don't open even if deleted and reinstalled! <body> I have a Problem here. Some apps I have installed don't even open and have this icon on my Springboard.    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/886yh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  My iOS version is 7.0.1. Jailbroken.  Two of my Applications have ended like this. I tried reinstalling the Apps, but nothing.  I haven't installed any tweaks recently and it just happened. I also disabled some tweaks that could be suspicious and I reinstalled the App, but after 2 days, the app did the same thing.  strongI can confirm that 8/10 of my last automatically Updated Apps crash on launch/strong and some icons don't show (as in the Screenshot).  strongAny tips?/strong  <answer135536> Install a tweak called iWipe cache, it will respring your Spring board and will do the deal.
