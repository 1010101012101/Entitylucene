Deleted contact phone numbers keep coming back <body> When I delete a contact's old phone number it immediately comes back. Something so basic should not require 20 minutes of Google searches that lead nowhere.   <comment353997> Can you clarify _how_ you're deleting the old number? Also, what version of iOS are you using? <comment354079> I discovered the contact was linked to an icloud contact. I deleted the icloud contact and that solved the problem.  But this is very non-obvious and confusing. One would assume if it's "linked" to an icloud contact that any changes to local contact would be reflected in icloud contact. 30 minutes of my life gone.
