Received a FaceTime call from unknown person <body> I have received a FaceTime call from unknown source. I'm not sure who this person is, nor do I know the caller's email.  What can I do? I don't want unknown people contacting me. It was from an iCloud email address.  <answer182570> Block that caller! And if he or she calls again just contact Apple and they will help you resolve the problem! Just follow my steps and you will be fine!  <comment107927> What could it have happen? Im don't like tha unknown specialy if they are facetime calls. <comment108009> Anyone can call anyone. You cannot stop someone from calling you. Do not answer the phone if you don't know who is calling. <comment217421> Would you mind posting the necessary steps?
