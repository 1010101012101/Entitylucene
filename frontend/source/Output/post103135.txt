App Store buttons in the ios7 world: still shiny? <body> It appears the Apple App Store badge and images are still shiny. I assumed the reflections would go away after ios7 was formally released.  Has Apple announced if and when the buttons would change? I expect they would communicate on this since it's a very common marketing material that is substantially out of date with the new design.  <answer123744> No change has been pre-announced (and that would be a surprise).   Furthermore, Apple's marketing guidelines have not changed the design of the badge and buttons in conjunction with iOS 7's release.  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines//li /ul  <comment121410> Rather than bounce this off as primarily discussion / off topic - is there a practical question you are trying to get solved rather than just wanting to poll people to find out their opinions? <comment121431> sorry, @bmike, by "has there been discussion" I meant "has Apple made an announcement about". I'll change the wording. <comment121467> Let's see what voters say - it's still a yes / no question. You also didn't edit in the problem you face as a user of Apple product / service so people will likely have to guess if they want to try an answer. <comment121478> I have never known Apple to make announcements about such things. If the shininess offends them then one day it will be silently replacedâ€”providing headlines for "up to the minute" tech blogs. I'm following @bmike's lead for now, but my instinct would be *vote to close.* <comment121479> I just wanted to get it over to StackOverflow if it's really a question only registered developers can answer. I can't log in and see what the @tedder42 is actually looking at, but since it's not code-level this might be the best place for the topic. <comment121503> yeah, I know it's a weird stackexchange-style question. I'm okay with it being closed. Thanks for the feedback bmike and @jaberg.
