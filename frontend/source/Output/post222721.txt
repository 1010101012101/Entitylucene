Cannot change startup disk - Yosemite <body> I've got a clean install of Yosemite on a brand new hard drive. All good, up and running (got to boot to it manually). As the title says, I can't get the system to boot from this hard drive.  Error      The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk   Tried it via bless command in terminal  precodesudo bless -mount /Volumes/MAC\ HD -setBoot  Could not find IODeviceTree:/options /code/pre  <comment269910> Sounds like Hackintosh! Please add some details... like `bless --info --verbose`, `ioreg -l -p IODeviceTree`,  `diskutil list` etc. <comment269923> I can't at the moment, back in office on Monday. However, I reset NVRAM like suggested on here http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20224/can-not-set-startup-disk before I left. Made it worse: Grey/White screen of death after startup sound.
