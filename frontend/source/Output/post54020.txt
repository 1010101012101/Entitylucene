How to reformat and re-install an old G5 <body> I was given an old G5, and the existing installed OS is locked, and I don't have the password. I don't care about erasing its whole content. I have a bunch of CDs, and I want to know how can I restart this machine so it boots from the CD and reformat the whole system. I am very new to MAC world.   I realise this is a MAC 101 question type, but I need to start somewhere......  Thanks :-)  <answer54021> You can restart while holding down the kbdC/kbd key to boot from a valid Mac OS X Install CD / DVD for that G5 based Mac. To pick and choose what disk your machine can boot from hold down the kbdoption/kbd key while starting the Mac.  Also depending on which version of Mac OS X is installed there are different ways to reset the password in single user mode. This may be an option for you if you just want to  unlock and add / remove users and you have a startup CD/DVD for that Mac.  See  Changing or resetting an account password for some instructions on how to reset the password.
