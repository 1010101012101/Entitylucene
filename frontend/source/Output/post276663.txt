How do I get back my apple iphone icon on file explorer? <body> Running windows 10 and I use to have an apple icon which made it easy to delete photos or copy to my Lenovo desktop PC.  Somewhere along the line it disappeared and now when I plug in via usb cable I hear the sound so computer knows it is there.  I can sync with iTunes but can upload photos but I cannot delete from from my phone.
