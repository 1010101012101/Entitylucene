How to undo an Automator Action <body> So for some reason I decided to add an action to my workflow, which is to add a copy of a screenshot with a smaller size because my Retina display photos were to large.  I followed steps I found on the stack exchange. But now my iMac is repeating the action for some reason and I'm ending up with 1000+ screenshots of the same image on my desktop.  <comment329512> Without you adding the code of the Automator action/workflow to your question, we won't be able to help you.
