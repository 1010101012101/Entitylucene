Windows positioning with applescript <body> I want to set the position of some windows to certain coordinates.  In particular I have 4 possible positions that those windows should have.  For example if I have 4 windows opened I want them to go one per each position, instead if I have 6 windows opened I want the first 4 windows to go to to position 1,2,3,4 then the last 2 to position 1 and 2. I mean if I had 12 windows opened those should go to position 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4.  At the moment I've managed to get the IDs of those windows in a list.  precode--list with all windows set Auch to {...}  repeat with theWindow in Auch     tell (windows whose title contains theWindow) -- it's working         activate         set position to {200, 20} --position #1     end tell end repeat /code/pre  This is the code I've written: I'm sure there's a smart way to solve this problem.  <answer112340> Use the modulo operator !   precodeset Auch to {...}      --list with all windows set positionArray to {{..}, {..},{..}} -- The array where you store the positions you want.   set ind to 0 repeat with theWindow in Auch     tell (windows whose title contains theWindow)         activate         set position to item ((ind mod (count of positionArray)) + 1) of positionArray --AppleScript arrays start at 1          set ind to (ind + 1)     end tell end repeat /code/pre  <comment131861> Sorry, I'm a newbie with applescript. How should I implement this into my code? I'm trying to understand your code :) <comment131892> I edited my code ! <comment131920> It gives me an error in this line "repeat with ind  (count of array). It says that "from" or "in" was expected instead of "". However many thanks for your help! <comment131935> corrected, I had a typo with = while. <comment131942> Sorry if I ask again but now it gives me this error: " couldn't get "ind mod (count of positionArray) + 1". Access not allowed." <comment132394> Well it should work now!
