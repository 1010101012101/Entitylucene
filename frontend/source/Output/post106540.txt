Problem with exporting with gimp <body> I usually export images through gimp. This time, I was on my new OS X Mavericks, as I tried to change the name of the image which was "LOST", was not working. I observed the toolbox going to another tool as I typed the letters. I knew that I was pressing a shortcut but when I tried to press another letter like "y", the letter showed at the name of the image. How am I suppose to name the image when I export it?  <answer108759> This is known issue with Gimp and Mavericks. Current workaround is to turn off all keyboard shortcuts (Preferences/Interface/Remove All Keyboard Shortcuts).
