"Ghost text" in terminal, Yosemite + TotalTerminal (formerly Visor) <body> There's "ghostet text" in my terminal (see screenshot), and I'm hoping someone knows how to fix this…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2qdo2.png" alt="Ghostet text in terminal, OS X Yosemite 10.10.1, background opacity 75 %, integrated graphics"  Turning background transpareny off fixes the problem, but it's not a solution which I'm a fan of.  I tried cranking the opacity up to 100 % (thus turning transparency off), ran some commands, and turned the opacity back to 75 %, which made the ghosting appear yet again.  I love working in the terminal, and really hope someone have a suggestion for a fix :)  emSpecs which might be relevant:/em  ul liOS X Yosemite 10.10.2/li liMacbook Pro 8.1 (early 2011)/li liIntegrated graphics/li liUsing TotalTerminal 1.5.4/li /ul  <answer174267> This one helped me:     Open your Terminal preferences, go to Profiles  Window  Background (Color &amp; Effects), and set a light blur.      I use 30% to keep anything in the background from disturbing the readability of thin fonts on an already translucent window, so I never noticed the "burn-in" effect when moving to Yosemite.   supSource: http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/text-burn-in-when-using-transparent-backgrounds-since-yosemite/2849/sup  However I set blur to 1% and "ghost" text disappeared.  <answer223289> More recently in the thread linked to above, the developer of TotalTerminal replied:     darwin - Sep '15      TotalTerminal is not going to work on El Capitan without System Integrity    Protection disabled. That is why I stopped developing it and switched personally  to iTerm2. I'm sorry, but I won't fix this one.   http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/text-burn-in-when-using-transparent-backgrounds-since-yosemite/2849/11   So it looks like we're out of luck, at least for now. I've noticed the ghosting for a while, and right now I'm actually running TotalTerminal on El Capitan (with SIP disabled I guess), and would love to keep using it, but it sounds like I'll have to take it with this little wart or not at all.  <comment199071> I guess I'll ask the obvious question. Are you sure that's not whatever is behind the window showing through? <comment199141> Yes, I'm certain it's a shadow of the terminal output – it happens no matter the background, and I deliberately used a purely white background for the screenshot :) <comment204892> And here I was, thinking it was "just" the usual image retention on my retina MacBook Pro… I suppose it has something to do with the way TotalTerminal renders the pane? Maybe you could post this on the [binary forums](http://discuss.binaryage.com) too? <comment205072> FYI: Found [this thread](http://discuss.binaryage.com/t/text-burn-in-when-using-transparent-backgrounds-since-yosemite/2849/6) on their forums, where users complain about the same issue, but no fix yet. <comment205219> Doesn't fix the problem on my machine :( <comment205346> Today I turned on my computer and see that it's returned.. Sorry, this answer is not valid :( I set blur to 30% and it stopped to annoy me so much, but it still appears. I'll continue to trying find out the solution. <comment205498> I've spent quite a lot of time to check/uncheck all possible things and try everything non-dirty to fix this. Everything that I can suggest to you - clear screen before slide-up your terminal. Ghost text appears only when you slide-up with tab full of text, then slide-down and change to another tab. <comment228461> Blur doesn't help, just blurs more the ghost text so it increases the readability. Would they fix that?
