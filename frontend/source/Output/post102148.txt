Mountain Lion Screen Freeze <body> My Mountain Lion is keeps freezing from few weeks, today it freezes/crashed couple of times already.  Here is the log before the big freeze (file /var/log/system.log):  precodeSIMBL Enabler for Sandboxed Apps[3334]: Will terminate until reinvoked again by launchd. com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.pbs[3243]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3243 [pbs] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.iCloudHelper[3241]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3241 [com.apple.iCloud] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.xpcd.F5010000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000[3238]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3238 [xpcd] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3237]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3237 [SleepServicesD] com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.CalendarAgent[3188]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3188 [CalendarAgent] kernel[0]: (default pager): [KERNEL]: ps_select_segment - send HI_WAT_ALERT kernel[0]: macx_swapon SUCCESS com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3362]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3362 [SleepServicesD] SubmitDiagInfo[3240]: Launched to submit Diagnostics and Usage com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.daemon[3235]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3235 [cfprefsd] WindowServer[222]: reenable_update_for_connection: UI updates were finally reenabled by application "Activity Monitor" after 125.95 seconds (server forcibly re-enabled them after 1.00 seconds) com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3364]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3364 [SleepServicesD] coreaudiod[249]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active coreaudiod[249]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.pbs[3369]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3369 [pbs] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3368]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3368 [SleepServicesD] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.daemon[3366]): Exited: Killed: 9 com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[265] (com.apple.cfprefsd.xpc.agent[3225]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3366 [cfprefsd] kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3225 [cfprefsd] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3387]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3387 [SleepServicesD] com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.locationd[3191]): Exited with code: 1 com.apple.launchd[1] (com.apple.sleepservicesd[3388]): Exited: Killed: 9 kernel[0]: memorystatus_thread: idle exiting pid 3388 [SleepServicesD] locationd[3405]: Incorrect NSStringEncoding value 0x8000100 detected.

This is happening even after fresh restart and open few Chrome web-browser tabs. Based on the logs, it seems like MACX Swap is started to be used, despite of 4GB memory. I've checked the high usage in Activity Monitor, and the highest were kernel and mds with around 800MB usage. There is plenty of space on HDD (SDD).    This problem is widely experienced, so please don't underestimate it.

It's quite useful, but I had few crashes with it: https://code.google.com/p/simbl/issues/detail?id=69 <comment120470> What was the result of the RAM test? <comment120473> Exited: Killed: 9 =  SIGKILL     The SIGKILL signal is sent to a process to cause it to terminate immediately (kill). In contrast to SIGTERM and SIGINT, this signal cannot be caught or ignored, and the receiving process cannot perform any clean-up upon receiving this signal. <comment120508> Tested RAM with Rember app, it didn't find anything wrong.
