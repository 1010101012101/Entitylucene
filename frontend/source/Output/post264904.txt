How do I get Siri to call Amy instead of Aimee? <body> I don't even have a phone number for Aimee.  Amy is even marked as a favorite. Whenever I say "Call Amy" then Siri says "I don't have a phone number for Aimee."  It was working with iOS 9.   iOS 10.1.1, iPhone 5,1.   <answer265030> Not really a soultion, but would probably work anyway:  Roll with it - add Amy's phone number to Aimee's contact info!  <answer265035> If both people are in your strongContacts/strong, you can give one, or both, a nickname.  When using Siri, you can refer to the person by nickname and Siri will know who you're talking about.   To add a nickname to a person:  ol liOpen the emContacts/em app/li liTap the contact you want to view, then tap codeEdit/code/li liScroll down and tap codeadd field -&gt; Nickname/code/li liAdd a nickname and tap codeDone/code/li /ol  To remove a nickname, just reverse the steps.  You can change the nickname at any time.  Source  <comment332117> Add Aimee or Amy's last name. Or are they also homophones? <comment332173> They both have last names entered. I want to use just the first name to call. <comment332363> Do we work for machines or do machines work for us? <comment332366> I added the nickname Amy but it didn't work. I also tried the nickname Aimee  and that didn't work either. <comment332378> The iPhone can't tell the difference in the spelling when the names sound the same.  Did you set each person up with a nickname that doesn't sound like the other person's nickname?  You can't use 'Amy' and 'Aimee' as nicknames because they sound the same to the iPhone. <comment332414> @Chloe, sometimes I do wonder....
