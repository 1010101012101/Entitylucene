Playing fullscreen in the same window <body> I have Vlc version 2.1.4 operating on Mac OSx Yosemite.  When I open any VLC video to fullscreen, it opens into a separate window, or desktop. What i want to do is to be able to fullscreen the video yet have it stay within the desktop that I used to open the file. Is that possible?  <answer178563> You may try to enable 'Show video within the main window' option.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bNbEo.png" alt="VLC - Show video within the main window - screenshot"  <answer178564> No. Since I think Mavericks, full-screen sets itself up as a new Space. You might be able to work around it on 2 monitors by using 'Displays have separate Spaces' in System Prefs  Mission Control.  <comment192677> No. Since I think Mavericks, full-screen sets itself up as a new Space.
