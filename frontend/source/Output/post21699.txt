How do I connect to a Windows Remote Desktop with a Terminal Services Gateway in OS X? <body> The Microsoft-provided RDP client here:  http://www.microsoft.com/mac/remote-desktop-client  Does not support connecting via a Terminal Services Gateway. Are there any other options?  <answer21731> Unfortunately, neither Microsoft's own client nor the popular CoRD alternative currently support it, and the latter likely won't for a while.  I haven't tested it, but the â‚¬20 iTap claims to support it.  <comment23972> iTap works great! Not sure if I'm ready to shell out the bucks, yet. But it's faster than booting up Boot Camp. <comment72773> Would a VNC client provide a useable workaround? <comment72774> No - I'm a developer on the Microsoft stack, and when I'm working remotely I want fast performance. So far, Windows 7 RDP client, or even the new 2.1 client from MS works the best if I'm on the network, but remotely, that won't work (unless you use VPN).
