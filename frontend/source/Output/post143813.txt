How to look up lost iTunes shared library password? <body> I forgot the password to my iTunes home shared library. I know I can set a new password in the iTunes prefs, but I do not want to update all my home devices to the new password! I cannot find the password in the keychain either.  <answer143823> Your Home-sharing password is your Apple ID password. It should exist in your keychain:  ol liType strongKeychain Access/strong in Spotlight. It should appear in the drop down menu. Open it. /li liSelect your strongLogin Keychain/strong /li liType in strongiTunes Store Password/strong in the search bar of Keychain access. /li liDouble click it and tick "Show Password"/li /ol  If this appears:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mf3eL.png" alt="enter image description here"  Type in your user account password and click allow. You should then see your Apple ID password in plaintext.   <comment169429> Whether or not the sharing user is an admin or not is irrelevant. The method of retrieving the password from Keychain Access works equally well for non-admin accounts, and you never need to type a separate admin password. <comment169430> @Kent updated. Thanks. <comment169459> "Your Home-sharing password is your Apple ID password." -- This was the missing information!
