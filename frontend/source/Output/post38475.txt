How do I remove video noise & grain in iMovie '11? <body> I'm attempting to remove some video noise/grain in iMovie 11 taken in low-light but haven't found a way to do this within iMovie itself. I've looked for plugins but the only ones I've found don't have free trials and I don't trust paying for software if I can't be assured it will work.  Is there a way to remove video noise/grain in iMovie?  <answer38586> Unfortunately iMovie doesn't take plugins.   Best bet is external software OR Final Cut Pro 7 has numerous plugins that reduce noise and grain, but they are all very expensive.  <comment43575> Grainyness is caused by a high ISO; used in settings of low light. I'm not really sure that can be fixed. For future reference, use a higher exposure setting, not a higher ISO setting. <comment43585> @daviesgeek You're right in saying that noise is a result of a high ISO, however I'm aware of that (I'm also a photographer) and noise/grain can be removed at least partly by comparing two neighboring frames and judging what of the resulting images is noise and what is actual data. I've seen stand-alone programs that do this for video, but iMovie doesn't seem to do this and so I'm looking for a plugin that adds this apparently missing functionality. :) <comment43586> Ok, that makes sense. <comment43726> I'd rather not spend that much on Final Cut Pro but iMovie does take plugins: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/815070?start=0&tstart=0 <comment43727> Ah.
