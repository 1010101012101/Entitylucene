How to highlight text in Preview properly? <body> I know this problem could be trivial, but it just bothers a lot. I can use the highlight function of preview properly before like the following:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2KjBV.png" alt=""  but now when I try to highlight the text again, it just messed up like below  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ykYLJ.png" alt=""  Is this a bug of preview? Any configuration could solve this problem?  <comment179587> what kind of file is it? <comment179596> @Buscarì›ƒ PDF file <comment179612> Did you recently upgrade your OS? What version of OS X are you using? It looks like it's still highlighting but using a "realistic" highlighter instead of just rectangular boxes around the words. <comment179613> It also could be due to the way the PDF you are trying to highlight was created. Try this, as this is reported to possibly help: Go to Tools  Rotate Left, then Tools  Rotate Right and try highlighting again. <comment179617> @tubedogg I'm using mavericks 10.9.5. I just re-downloaded the  file and now it works fine, but I'll try to use the way you suggested next time I encounter this problem, thanks :D <comment179670> @tubedogg unfortunately, I just encountered this problem again and tried your way but without luck.
