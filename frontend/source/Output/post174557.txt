Sort out Apple hosts <body> I have a question about Apple network traffic. In my network program I can see these three domains (GET)  http://init-01md.apple.com/bag  http://init.ess.apple.com/WebObjects/VCInit.woa/wa/getBag?ix=1  https://service1.ess.apple.com/...  These appear when I receive or send text messages from/to my iPhone. The question is:  Do these three domains show up even if it's NOT related to text messages?
