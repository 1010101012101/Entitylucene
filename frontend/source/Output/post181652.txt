Accidentally did rm -r ~/.Trash <body> What should I do now? Will my computer be okay?  <answer181653> Yup, the system will recreate it automatically.   Actually about code.Trash/code, it is located on every drive you will connect to your Mac and where you will delete some files. Deleted files on external drive won't show in your local code.Trash/code.   <comment216053> well at least you specified to rm the Trash only, unlike some who do rm- rf and then wonder what happened.
