How do I resolve the following issue? <body> I have Steam as a Wineskin wrapper, because a game called The Escapists is Windows only. That game has a map editor which requires Java Runtime Environment 8 and is for mac also. On mac, you run it with codejava -jar/code.   However when I launch it, it wants me to write a path to where the game is located. I at least think you should write it, because in Terminal, it displays "Please locate the game in the following prompt" and then a window pops up with the exact same text.  Steam has games in its Application Support, which is located on strongdrive_c/strong in the wrapper as a Windows executable, and pointing to that did not work. I tried putting the map editor App on the same wrapper as Steam, but the JRE 8 installer keeps failing and displaying a window with "Oops. no new executables found. Maybe the installer failed".  How do I install JRE on the wrapper, or how could I make the game files compatible with the editor?  <comment233417> Which re did you install in the wrapper? <comment233418> @Mark Java Runtime Environment 8 update 45. I tried all the Windows installers in there. I know that Wrappers are x86, but I tried x64 as well. However the installation failed and the message with "Maybe the installer failed" showed
