Can I enable hardware-based full disk encryption on the Windows side of a bootcamp install? <body> I am running a MBP with a partitioned Samsung 840 EVO SSD. I want to encrypt both the OS X and Windows partitions. It looks like using the SSD's built-in hardware full disk encryption on the OS X side is a no-no, so I plan to use FileVault2 on that side.  For the windows side, I'm wondering whether I can turn on the hardware FDE as described in Samsung's notes (set an ATA password in the BIOS) without messing up Bootcamp's ability to control the two drives. If not, I will probably use windows EFS on a selected area of the drive, or use TrueCrypt.  Thanks!
