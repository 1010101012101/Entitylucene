OS X Terminal displaying รถ when typing | <body> It's the first time this has happened to me. Does anyone know why this could be happening? I think I configured something wrong in the keyboard settings.  This is working fine in Word 2011, for example.  <answer146184> It probably has something to do with the "Automatically switch to a document's input source" option in System Preferences - Keyboard - Input Sources, which allows you to have different output sources for different applications/tabs/documents. Simply uncheck that to only use one keyboard layout for all applications  <comment155505> which keyboard layout are you using? Are you switching between multiple? <comment155506> I connected an external keyboard some days ago. I should have look at settings to see what could be happening. The thing is that I need to pipe in terminal! <comment155507> I'm using Spanish - ISO as input source <comment155509> OK, I rebooted the computer and is working fine now.
