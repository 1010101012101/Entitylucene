Disable Genre Art in iTunes 11? <body> New iTunes bumps up the font size and adds Genre images to Genre column view. I make custom Genres for sorting and don't need the visual hinting. Anyone know how/if I can disable this? I'm not able to find anything.   Otherwise I guess I'll just be using the Song view. I really liked the three column Genre sort up until now. :(  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3UT1M.png" alt="Boring Genre Art"  <answer73432> You can remove the genre-*.jpg files in the application bundle. iTunes will use the cover art of tracks for the genres though.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kmSrW.png" alt=""  It also breaks the code signature and could be overridden by updates.  <answer99656> I prefer to use album artwork for genre artwork. To do this I edited codegenres.plist/code in iTunes resources folder using codeProperty List Editor/code, under 'Root' I deleted 'entries' which deletes all default itunes album artworks associative preference.  Another method is adding an   precode    exactStringMatch - Boolean - Check /code/pre  method to whichever 'Item' I prefer to change. This method is used for other genres by iTunes.  This method works for genres which don't have an exact genre matching name.  I suggest saving a copy of this codeplist/code prior to making any changes to it.  <comment85515> I'm not all that fond of the generic Apple or empty icons and I'd prefer to save space but I appreciate the step in the right direction. Thanks. <comment117265> Nice solution. I'll give it a try and report back.
