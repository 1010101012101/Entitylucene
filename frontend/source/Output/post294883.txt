Play button on earphones opens iTunes <body> Pressing the play button on earphones opens up iTunes. Is there a way I can prevent this from happening without installing any third party programs? I would preferably want to control Spotify with my earphones.   <answer294884> Not if there's nothing currently playing. Play controls will try to resume the last thing you played that is still running and in memory. If the OS can't find anything to resume, it will default to iTunes.   All media applications are equal; but, iTunes is more equal.   <answer294900> Without third party software you can't prevent this, however, there is a patch for the Remote Control Daemon: https://github.com/thebitguru/play-button-itunes-patch  <comment372230> I see. However, in my case Spotify is running in the background yet the play controls still won't control it.
