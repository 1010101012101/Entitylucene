SSH into different port <body> On terminal, I type  precodessh root@ipadress /code/pre  How do I ssh into something if it is not the default port 22, in my case it is 222  <answer134371> You can use the code-p/code option to choose a different port. So:  precodessh -p 222 root@ipaddress /code/pre  You can also look up help using the codeman/code (manual) command, like codeman ssh/code, to show help information, including usage, command line options, errors, etc. While in the man page, you can type code//code (the slash character) followed by any text (and kbdEnter/kbd) to search for that within the manual.
