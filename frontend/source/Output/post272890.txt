Change quickly icons of a folder and its subfolders <body> I need to change the folder icons of a selected folder and all the subfolder inside it with the same PNG image.  Accept any mode (Bash scripts, Automator workflows and so on...), I have no preferences.  <answer272904> This is a solution using the macOS GUI:  ol listrongCopy your PNG image/strong to your clipboard./li liWith Finder.app, strongopen the folder/strong whose folder and subfolder icons you want to change/li liPress CMD + F to strongstart a search/strong/li liIn the emSearch menu bar/em strongclick the folder's name/strong. "This Mac" must not be selected./li lienter strongcodekind:folder/code/strong/li liIn the results strongselect all/strong folders (CMD+A)./li liPress CMD+Shift+I to strongshow the Inspector/strong./li liIn the Inspector window strongselect the blue folder icon/strong in the upper left/li liPress CMD+V to strongpaste your PNG image/strong.

Sometimes you have to click twice on the icon in the Inspector window in order to paste the image successfully.   <comment343023> This very smart trick worked for me!  <comment343025> I'm glad it worked for you!
