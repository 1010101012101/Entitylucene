Finder rejecting/renaming file extension? <body> I was just attempting to set up a local web project, and came across a peculiar behavior. If I try to change an existing filetype from anything to code.scss/code, Finder ends up rejecting the new filetype and appending the old one to it.  Renaming codestyles.css &gt; styles.scss/code becomes codestyles.scss.css/code  Renaming codeblank.txt &gt; blank.scss/code becomes codeblank.scss.txt/code  If I use terminal or a text editor to rename and save the file as codestyles.scss/code, finder just leaves off the extension and shows it as codestyles/code.  This doesn't happen with a code.sass/code extension, so I can just use that for now - but I have other projects that use code.scss/code so I'd like to be able to get around this if possible. Has anyone run into this issue, or found a way to resolve it?  <answer202787> Found the answer in a related question here: Prevent automatically appending file extension when renaming file  The solution was to turn on the codeShow all filename extensions/code option in the Finder preferences; for some reason having it disabled forces Finder to append a "sensible" extension to files. This also solved a problem where my code.gitignore/code and code.htaccess/code files were being appended with an invisible code.txt/code
