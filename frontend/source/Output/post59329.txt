How can I fix the lag for share screening between Mountain Lion and Lion? <body> I screenshare with my friend everyday. It was working well until he updated to Mountain Lion. Now there is a significant delay regardless of network activity. Is there anyway to fix this?  <comment68378> This may be unrelated.  There was a recent update for the Apple Remote Desktop Client. Have you installed that update?  Has your friend? <comment68385> Yes, we both installed all latest updates
