iMessages - same message on two devices <body> I once bought a macbook for my friend. I logged into it using my own apple account to make sure it worked properly before delivering it to him. However, he now gets a copy of my iMessages. How can this link be removed so he will no longer be able to see my messages?  <answer161716> Go to System Preferencesâ†’iCloud on his machine, sign out of your iCloud account and into his.  <comment188927> Did you log out? Did you use forget this device in your Account.
