Run an Xcode project on another iPhone <body> So, I have a Mac and am doing iOS development work for a client. However, he does not have a Mac and therefore doesn't have Xcode and can't sign the app and run it on a phone. Is there anyway I can export an ipa and send it to him for him to install on his phone without him having a Mac? Thanks  <comment243813> Check out TestFlight or Beta by Crashlytics.  They can do what you want.
