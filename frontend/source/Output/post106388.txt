osascript "set bounds of window" not working after Mavericks upgrade <body> I have a number of bash functions I run at the beginning of each day to start work. They all look pretty much like this:  precodemind() {   osascript -e 'tell app "Terminal"     do script "ssh -A user@my.server.net"     set bounds of window 1 to {50, 50, 1200, 900}   end tell' } /code/pre  After upgrading to Mavericks, this is emmostly/em working, but it doesn't position the lower-right corner of the window. That is, it positions the top left corner of the new window at code50, 50/code, but fails to resize the window.  I have reinstalled XQuartz and have it running. How can I get this to resize properly? Did Mavericks change the way bash talks to AppleScript/XQuartz?  <answer106676> I temporarily fixed the problem by repeating the codeset bounds/code command three times in a row.  ol liThe first call moved the window (Terminal in my case) to the right position and gave it the right height but the width was mysteriously equal to the weight./li liThe second call did enlarge the window but to 1.5 the requested width (eyeballed)./li liThe third call made it just right./li /ol  This is slightly different than your problem but close enough that the fix might work. Repeating the command twice might be enough for you.  <answer106812> Try changing the size and position attributes or using System Events instead:  precodetell application "Terminal"     tell window 1         set size to {1150, 850}         set position to {50, 50}     end tell end tell /code/pre    precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     tell window 1         set size to {1150, 850}         set position to {50, 50}     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer119292> Lauri's answer almost worked for me, but I had to run the script twice.  Setting the position before the size fixed that.  It seems you get set a size that would cause the window to leave the screen...  precodetell application "System Events" to tell process "Terminal"     tell window 1         set position to {50, 50}         set size to {1150, 850}     end tell end tell /code/pre  Also, the first time you run this you should get a message about security, make sure you go into System Prefs - Security &amp; Privacy - Privacy - Accessibility and check "Terminal.app"  <answer120919> I move my laptop to several desks with external monitors. One one of these, all the positions are now (Mavericks) evaluated relative to "whatever screen the window happens to be one." On others, this is not so.  <comment124996> I too am having problems with my iterm osascript https://gist.github.com/earlonrails/2624352 <comment345066> This worked for me on Mac OS X Sierra, thank you!
