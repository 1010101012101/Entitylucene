tab to select drop-down input box <body> In any web browser in Mac OS X, how can I choose a drop-down form input box using the kbdtab/kbd key? When I need to input many forms including a drop-down box, I preferred to use kbdtab/kbd key and kbdshift/kbd+kbdtab/kbd to move between input elements in Windows systems.  Why is it impossible in Mac, and how can I do it?  <answer44167> Make sure you have this set (it's not the default) in Keyboard Preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TfFL7.png" alt="enter image description here"
