JDiskReport is damaged, can't be opened <body> I have tried downloading and running JDiskReport 1.4 a few times now, and after unzipping it and clicking on the executable I get the message:  precode"JDiskReport" is damaged and can't be opened.  You should move it to the Trash /code/pre  Why is it not working?  I'm running 10.8 Mountain Lion on a MacBook Pro.  <answer62327> Just tried this myself and confirmed that the executable gives the error you mentioned:  precode"JDiskReport" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash. /code/pre  I was able to get it to run setup by Ctrl-clicking JDiskReport.app, clicking codeShow Package Contents/code and navigating to Contents/Resources/Java/jdskreport-1.4.0.jar.  Ctrl-clicking this .jar file will allow you to click Open and bypass Mountain Lion's default 'unidentified developer' error.  I did not go completely through Setup (only confirmed that it ran), so try this and let me know how it goes.  <answer159525> The solution above, codeShow Package Contents.../code will also fix an code'Unable to load Java Runtime Environment.'/code on OS X Mavericks with Version 1.4.1 of JDiskReport. Sorry but I can't upvote or comment yet.  <comment72101> yes it is running for me now, thanks!
