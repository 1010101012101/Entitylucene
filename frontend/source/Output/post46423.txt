Remote desktop thru firewall via vpn <body> Scheme:  precodeMy_macbook -&gt; INTERNET -&gt; Linux_Proxy_Firewall-&gt; Lion_On_The_Internal_Network /code/pre  So, need set up encrypted tunnel between my macbook and Linux firewall and want connect into the internal Lion via Apple Remote Desktop.  Looking for a simple, bulletproof - verified solution (so, from someone who really use it) for using ARD via VPN (road warrior config).  Probably here is a way setup tunnels with plain ssh(1) or with SshTunnelManager, but never tried it yet - so any advice and/or real experiences is welcomed...  Asking for strongreal experience/strong because here Apple wrote:     When using VPN, you may need to set your router to allow a larger MTU   and/or to disallow fragmented packets. For details, refer to the Admin   Guide for your version of Apple Remote Desktop.   <answer46801> So... simple with ssh-tunnels:  Into the terminal:  precodessh -N -p 22 -c 3des user@firewall.example.com -L 15900/10.1.1.1/5900 -L 13283/10.1.1.1/3283 /code/pre  Where:  precodeuser@firewall.example.com - is an valid username on the firewall, and 10.1.1.1 - is the address of the lion-server on the internal network /code/pre  This will create two tunnels between local computer and remote firewall. In the Remote Desktop.app you should manually add the remote server like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nq0tl.jpg" alt="ARD config"  Now, you can observe/control the "internal-server" via tunnels thru firewall.example.com.  <comment53048> Are you already running VPN software on your Linux firewall? <comment53056> no, but isn't problem install "it". I'm currently using only ssh(1) tunnels for mail and for access the internal web-server. As I wrote, i never tried any ARD/VPN setup...
