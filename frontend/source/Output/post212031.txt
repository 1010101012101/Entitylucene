Safari 9 doesn't have the Address Bar and Back/Forward button <body> I'm having a serious problem in Safari 9. I am unable to set back the Back Button and the Address Bar. It's not showing anymore.  I've deleted a bunch of files in Cache, Preferences. Some procedures on Google talks about Safari - Reset Safari but it's not there anymore with Safari 9 and OS El Capitan.  In a nutshell, what is the way to reset as default Safari to have it in a clean, fresh state?  Thanks!  <comment256010> Did you try right-clicking the toolbar  Customise Toolbar & drag the default set back? <comment256032> No I did not, I have the Magic Mouse so I'm not sure how to right click. Is there a procedure around? Sorry for my lack of knowledge. <comment256035> You can either control/click or see here for switch-on options - http://www.imore.com/how-activate-right-click-functionality-mac
