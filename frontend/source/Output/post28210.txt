How can I open a Finder window in Desktop without switching to another one? <body> I have these five desktops with a dozen of full screen apps and feel very happy.  Say I'm at right strongDesktop 5/strong now. em(Sadly my picture is deleted since it wasn't uploaded to the site hosting service)/em  Now I want to open Finder to locate a file strongto open it on this desktop/strong.br So I click strongFinder/strong in Dock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKNgj.png" alt="enter image description here"   h1Ouch!/h1  I get dragged all the way to the  strongDesktop 1/strong because strongthat's where Finder is currently open/strong.  Well, that makes sense from a programmer's perspective (switch to Desktop with the app window).br But it doesn't make emany/em sense for user.  strongWhenever I press Finder, I want it to open on current desktop, because it's utility and not really an “app” I need to “switch to”./strong  I usually have half dozen Finder windows on different desktops and these redirects just get in my way.  strongIs there a workaround to make Finder in Dock desktop-bound, apart from choosing emNew Finder Window/em in menu?/strong   <answer28211> Look into strongHyperDock/strong it has a lot of cool enhancement for the Dock.  From the homepage:     h1Powerful Shortcuts/h1      HyperDock adds fully configurable shortcuts to your dock apps.   Assign key &amp; mouse shortcuts to your dock items to hide or quit apps, start Expose, open Safari tabs, Finder Windows and much more.   hr  You can also look into strongTotalFinder/strong, I believe it also has global shortcut allowing you to open a new window from anywhere.  <answer28245> You have several different options:  h3Create Finder Window with a Shortcut/h3     While this doesn't solve your problem with the dock, using a keyboard shortcut can be much faster and can help in your workflow.   ol liActivate Finder by clicking the desktop backgroundbr (If the desktop is cluttered with windows, pinch out to clean it up and then click)/li liUse the strongNew Finder Window/strong shortcut: kbd⌘/kbd + kbdN/kbd  /li /ol  h3Disable Spaces Auto-Switching/h3  Uncheck the Missions Control preferences checkbox to switch to a space with open windows for an application: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vvKHB.png" alt="enter image description here"  On a side note, this does not effect the Finder if you have the Assign to all Desktops option selected.

All Finder windows will be available on all desktops all the time.  I think its solves the problem posted in the question if you select "None"  <answer175029> There is a very easy way to do this: Set a shortcut for Spotlight and use it. I set my spotlight shortcut  to Control + Spacebar (so it doesn't interfere with other apps — especially the Adobe CC app pan &amp; zoom tools).   When I'm in some app and type that key combo I get a Finder window in the same Space I'm already in (not Finder Space) and the cursor is in the search field of the Window. It's in the same space I'm using (Finder needs to be set to All Desktops in Dock Finder Icon Options… All Desktops) overlaid over application I was using.  Set Spotlight shortcut in System Prefs Spotlight Spotlight Window shortcut:  <answer217909> I found a workable solution to this using BetterTouchTool (which is worth a download for many reasons other than just this use case) that mostly does what I want: strong3 finger tapping on the dock icon for Finder, Terminal, Safari, etc opens a new window in the current space. However, it only does the right thing if the app already has other windows open/strong. If the app isn't open, or doesn't already have any open windows, it'll either send the Command-N to the current app while the clicked one is opening, or it'll open up two new windows (once when activated, once for Command-N).  This is a bit of a pain, although maybe not a deal-breaker because a standard left click will do the correct thing where this gesture fails.  ol liset up a new gesture of your choice (I'm using 3 finger tap) and assign it to "Activate Currently Hovered App in Dock"/li liselect "Attach Additional Action" and assign it to a keyboard shortcut of Command-N/li liif, like me, you have 3 finger tap already assigned to middle click (or any other action), you'll want to click the gear icon to the left of the gesture selector to make the Command-N action only trigger when over the dock, and the middle click action only trigger when not over the dock/li limake sure to disable spaces auto-switching, as found in Kassym's answer/li /ol  I have a feeling we're only going to get a good fix for this if Apple acknowledges this space-per-task use case, so please send them feedback.  <comment32532> This is a good solution because it really fits the “utility” paradigm I described. Thanks. <comment32534> The first option, combined with a tip I added on how to activate Finder from any screen, solves the issue most elegantly. Thanks a ton. <comment32535> Cool but hacky. Still, cool. <comment32538> I'm marking [this](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28210/how-to-open-finder-window-in-desktop-without-switching-to-another-one/28245#28245) as answer because it doesn't require any additional software. Thank you for the suggestion, though. <comment61790> I cannot tell you how much this solution made my life easier. It's a real pain trying to open finder while working on screen n and then get pushed to screen m. Thanks a lot !!!!! <comment103924> Dan - we lost your original picture - I've moved the remaining item to site hosting (imgur) - so be sure to use them in the future. Losing data is not something we like to see here. <comment104016> @bmike Thanks. I've been using imgur for a long time now myself. <comment206240> There's a much easy way to do this and to leave Spaces switching intact (because it's very useful!). Assign a spotlight shortcut for a new window and use that. Finder window is placed on top of current app even with Spaces Switching ON. I made an answer below so you can upvote it. <comment314044> To generalize this to other applications, you need to ensure that the application is not assigned to any particular desktop, since `Cmd-N` in such cases creates the new window in the desktop to which the application is assigned <comment367873> I'm not sure if this of any help. While it might work for some, if you're like the OP and have a minimum of 5 desktop open, you'll probably have multiple finder windows, some which not relevant for the current space at all.
