Building boot caches on boot helper partition failed <body> Due to a Hard Drive failure I have had to restore my mac from a backup. Following the strongRestore From Time Machine Backup/strong procedure under recovery mode takes about 8 hours. Eventually the data is restored on the new hard drive, but the drive won't boot. It gets stuck at around 50% of the boot process with the apple logo.  I have tried the strongReinstall macOS/strong procedure under recovery mode, but at the end it prompts the message:     strongOS X could not be installed on your computer/strong      Building boot caches on boot helper partition failed. Quit the installer to restart your computer   This happens for both Mavericks as for Sierra.  What can I do to fix this problem? After several, very long attempts, I am desperate to get my data and mac back.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aJZ4Q.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer275099> I have fixed my problem. Before the crash of my hard drive, I was using Yosemite as OS. Apparently you cannot restore a backup made in Yosemite with a bootable USB of either Mavericks or Sierra or with the network restore of Lion.  I eventually made a bootable USB drive of Yosemite and reinstalled a new copy of Yosemite on my new HDD. After installation I used the strongMigration Assistant/strong to retrieve my data. This took several hours, but afterwards I could normally reboot my computer. I had tried this same procedure with Lion, Mavericks and Sierra, but that didn't work and the computer wouldn't boot.  So if you find yourself having to restore a time machine backup, use a bootable macOS of the same macOS version you were running.   <comment345850> Please boot to Recovery Mode, open Terminal in the menubar  Utilities and enter `diskutil list` and `gpt -r show disk0`. Take a pic of the results and add it to your question. <comment347247> I knew you couldn't go 'downhill', didn't know you can't go 'uphill' either.
