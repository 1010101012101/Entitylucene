Packet loss and massive latency with Photo Stream <body> I have a home network with a couple iPhones and a small pile of Mac laptops. All have WiFi through a Time Capsule. Frequently, the entire network will go from a 40ms ping to the 'net to a 1500ms ping, with massive packet loss (25-50%). Every computer on the network experiences it (including a hardwired desktop machine).  When this occurs, shutting down one particular Mac or iPhone will solve the problem. The network instantly gets better. I am pretty certain that it is caused by Photo Stream synchronization:  ul liIt often occurs after one of the iPhones has taken a lot of pictures or movies./li liOn several occasions we have found the offending machine (by putting it to sleep and finding the problem solved) and turned off Photo Stream synchronization in iPhoto. At that point the laptop can be left on with no ill effect on the network./li /ul  How can I further investigate this problem, to prove (or disprove) that the source of the problem is Photo Stream, and to understand exactly what's going on with the network (packet flooding? malformed packets? something else?) causing these symptoms?  hr  supemTime capsule is using software version 7.6.3. Laptops are using various versions of OS X, including 10.8.4. Various versions of iPhoto are installed, including 9.4.3. iPhones are a 4S and 5. There is also a 3rd party router and separate ethernet Hub (the Time Capsule is in Bridged Ethernet mode) on the network, but I do not suspect that they contribute to the problem./em/sup  <comment114025> What network monitoring tools do you use ? <comment114062> @Buscarì›ƒ My "network monitoring" in this case is simply `ping www.google.com` whenever all Internet access becomes terrible. :) <comment114065> So we are not talking about internal network, but the Internet speed. If one of the unit is demanding gigabits of data transfer the rest on your network will suffer since there is a limited IP band-with.
