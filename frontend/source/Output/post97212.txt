netstat: n: unknown or uninstrumented protocol <body> I always use netstat on ubuntu to check which processes are listening on specific ports. I use the following switches with netstat that work fine on ubuntu but on mac fail:  precodesudo netstat -tulpn netstat: n: unknown or uninstrumented protocol /code/pre  <answer97222> You can let your Mac "listen" on a network interface:  Type codesudo tcpdump -i en0/code (followed by your administrator password)  <answer97231> Linux's codenetstat/code command options and OS X(/BSD)'s have almost nothing to do with each other. Of the options you're invoking, only code-n/code means the same on both, and some of the others (code-l/code and code-p/code) have no equivalent on OS X's codenetstat/code. What I habitually use on OS X is codenetstat -an | grep LISTEN/code, but that doesn't show UDP or the program involved. I suppose you could use codenetstat -an | egrep '^udp|LISTEN'/code to include UDP, but that's rather verbose (and you'll also see quite a bit of nonsense UDP stuff, since there isn't really a concept of UDP listening vs. other states).  If you need to know the program, you need to go to the codelsof/code (list open files) command, and that requires root access to check processes you don't own. Try something like codesudo lsof -nPi -sTCP:LISTEN/code  <answer274841> em@gordon-davisson is right, but you can still get the codepid/code from codenetstat/code on mac with the verbove option. I post an answer as I lack the reputation to comment his answer./em  hr  So, if the question is how to get codepid/code and codeport/code in a codenetstat/code command, you can still do:  codenetstat -anv/code  the verbose option gives the codepid/code in postition 9 like this:  precodeProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)     rhiwat shiwat    pid   epid tcp4       0      0  127.0.0.1.3335         *.*                    LISTEN      131072 131072  45710      0 /code/pre  But the output is plethoric, which is bearable if you know what you look for, like: codenetstat -anv | grep 3335/code or codenetstat -anv | grep LISTEN/code  The output of codelsof/code is still nicer.  <comment114054> -p requires a protocol `man netstat`
