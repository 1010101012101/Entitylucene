Configuring yahoo messenger on iChat <body> Is it possible to configure strongYahoo Messenger/strong on strongiChat/strong? There are options in iChat to configure Google talk, yahoo messenger, AOL etc. So far I know it is possible to configure Google talk. But I did not get any document or evidence to configure Yahoo Messenger. I do not know why? Is it possible to fix this problem??? I am talking about strongMac OS X Lion/strong.  <answer39750> You will need to sign up for a Yahoo! account by going here.   Once you have done that, you can configure Yahoo Messenger in iChat by doing the following:  ul liOpen iChat/li liOpen iChat Preferences by going to the menu item iChat  Preferences or by hitting kbd&#8984;/kbd + kbd,/kbd on your keyboard/li liGo to Accounts/li liClick the strong+/strong button/li liSelect "Yahoo" from the drop down menu under Account Type:/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yws4T.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liAuthenticate using your Yahoo account credentials/li liEnjoy using iChat with Yahoo./li /ul  <answer85391> This method works for text chat. iChat claims to support video and SMS via Yahoo, but used the method above to configure Yahoo, and I got no option for video chat.
