Highlight sentence feature with text-to-speech <body> Up to now, text-to-speech (TTS) combined with highlighting sentences is by far the best way I found to read fast and at the same time very relaxed. I need an application or browser extension that enables highlighting sentences while reading them using text-to-speech (TTS) method.  I'm currently using TTS feature of Mac OSX but I really need this feature since I tested it with Moon+ Android App, for example, and facilitates a lot the reading. Basically, it allows you to read without directly reading each word, just visually follow sentence length.  Do anyone know any App for Mac or browsers extension? Thanks!  <answer124876> I believe that this is among the features of Kurzweil reader. They offer a free trial, so you can see whether this is what you'd like.  Another solution is Apple's own VoiceOver, which is built into the system. See especially the chapter on Working With Text.  <answer125855> OK, finally I found what I was looking for.  http://www.chromevox.com/ https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn  <comment146132> Do you like a browser plugin or do you want everything to be TTS?
