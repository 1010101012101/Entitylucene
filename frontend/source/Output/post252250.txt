MacBook Air can't adjust iMac's brightness as external monitor <body> I'm using a 2016 MacBook Air connected to iMac 2009 as external monitor. Is there a way to adjust the iMac brightness from my MBA's keyboard? Currently, whenever I connect my MacBook Air, the brightness of iMac changes to maximum level and I can't control it from the MBA.  I tried kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdf1/kbd &amp; kbdcontrol/kbd + kbdf2/kbd, to no avail.
