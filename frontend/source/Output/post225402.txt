How to open an app with an old Mac OS X version? <body> Well, not that old. I'm trying to open OpenEmu (which requires 10.11), but I have a 10.10.1 version. I can't update it to the latest version because whenever I do that, my pc gets slower and slower, every time. I have already tried to change the info.plist version requirement and I also restarted my computer, but it didn't work. Any help?  <comment273482> Even if you persuade it to run, there's probably a very good reason it's limited to 10.11, the likelihood it will run well on 10.10 is low. Also, why are you still on 10.10.1? You're missing a whole lot of improvements & security updates. <comment273483> Probably It wont work. It might be using Frameworks and methods introduced in the OS X 10.11 so it'll crash on the lower versions. <comment273484> Tetsujin, did you miss the part that my mac gets worse every update? <comment273486> Then run the 10.10.5 combo directly. There's no reason whatsoever for a machine to 'slow down' between minor versions. Plus, El Capitan is specifically designed to be faster than Yosemite. <comment273492> @Tetsujin Exactly <comment273493> @Tetsujin thank you. But I hope this will be my last update. <comment273495> Get VirtualBox or purchase Parallels or VMware and install El Capitan in a VM. In the ElCap VM install OpenEmu. After two weeks playing upgrade the host to El Capitan and enjoy the speediness.
