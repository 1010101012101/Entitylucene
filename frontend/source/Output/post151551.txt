When trying to upgrade osxfuse, I get "missing DEVELOPER_DIR path" message <body> I recently installed Yosemite, and am now trying to upgrade all of my brew installs (codebrew update/code, then codebrew upgrade/code). After remembering to do codexcode-select --install/code, I finally got all of my installs upgraded except for encfs and osxfuse (encfs depends on osxfuse). Now, when trying to upgrade, I get the following results (entirety included because it's not that big):  precode▶ brew upgrade                                                    ==&gt; Upgrading 2 outdated packages, with result: encfs 1.7.5_1, osxfuse 2.7.1 ==&gt; Upgrading encfs ==&gt; Installing encfs dependency: osxfuse ==&gt; Cloning https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse.git Updating /Library/Caches/Homebrew/osxfuse--git ==&gt; Checking out tag osxfuse-2.7.1 ==&gt; ./build.sh -t homebrew -f /usr/local/Cellar/osxfuse/2.7.1  OSXFUSEBuildTool()            : supported platforms: 10.9 10.10 OSXFUSEBuildTool()            : building OSXFUSE kernel extension and tools xcrun: error: missing DEVELOPER_DIR path:  OSXFUSEBuildTool() failed: xcodebuild cannot build configuration Release.  READ THIS: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting /code/pre  Naturally, I've been to the troubleshooting page, and was still not able to solve my problems (although it might've helped me solve problems with earlier formulae). The results of codebrew doctor/code are:  precode▶ brew doctor Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an issue.

Does anybody have any suggestions for how I can fix this?  <answer151750> Upgrading Xcode to 6.1 with the link provided by pczora in fact resolved this problem for me: https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_6.1/xcode_6.1.dmg  <comment178519> Have you tried updating XCode? You can download it [here](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_6.1/xcode_6.1.dmg) <comment178554> @pczora, that did the trick. I'd noticed that `brew doctor` had suggested it, but (a) didn't know off-hand how to download it, and (b) was skeptical it would help, so didn't pursue (a). Thanks! Make your comment an answer, and I'll accept it.
