Can I add 16 gigs to the 13 inch non-Retina MacBook Pro? <body> The latest updates to MBPs non-retina say they can support upto 8 gigs of RAM. I had a mid-2011 13 inch MBP which I upgraded to 16 gigs.   The 13 inch MBP has 2 RAM slots. Has anyone successfully added 16 gigs to this version MBP? Is it possible?  Thanks in Advance  <answer88745> This article from the MacObserver says yes.  <answer89108> Based on the article references by @Matthieu, I ordered 2 8gig RAM sticks from Other World Computer and have successfully installed 16 gigs of RAM on my 2012 MacBook Pro. The System Info panel does display 2 slots as containing 8 gigs each for a total of 16 gigs.   If you are ordering RAM please ensure that the voltage spec matches the newer model's 1.35V instead of 1.5V from the previous (2011) version. I do have 2 sticks of PC 133 DDR3 but the voltage requirement is 1.5. This could cause issues like some users have reported.  <comment104018> This question may also be helpful http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/73701/using-memory-with-a-higher-mhz-rating
