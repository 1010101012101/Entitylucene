Mouse scrolling by 'page' <body> How can I configure OS X Mountain Lion to scroll one 'page' at a time?  OS X's Scrolling Speed in Mouse preferences doesn't have the effect of what I'm looking for.  The default/current behavour is that the first few wheel scrolls is one 'line' at a time. Only when you've scrolled a few wheel clicks in quick sequence does it start to scroll in larger chunks.  I have a Logitech MX 510 mouse. The Logitech control panel has no options here either.  Are there any Mountain Lion tweaks I can make or is there any FREE software to help?  <answer58531> USB Overdrive can do that but it's not free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NIlYj.png" alt=""  You could also add a rule like this to KeyRemap4MacBook's private.xml. The behavior when scrolling multiple ticks was a bit weird on the mouse I tested with; it only scrolled a full page about once every 0.5 seconds.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;Test&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix/&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;94D0530F-70BA-4DA9-BD45-C223A689A807&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;--ScrollWheelToKey-- ScrollWheel::UP, KeyCode::PAGEUP&lt;/autogen&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;--ScrollWheelToKey-- ScrollWheel::DOWN, KeyCode::PAGEDOWN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  You can also increase the scrolling speed with codedefaults write -g NSScrollWheelMultiplier -float 200/code.
