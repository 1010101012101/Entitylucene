Problem ejecting external disks <body> I use a lot of external disks and often I use spotlight to locate files on these disks. Almost always, whenever I do that I am initially unable to eject such a disk.   When that happens I issue  code/usr/bin/sudo  lsof | grep "/Volumes/disk_name"/code  and invariably mds shows up as the culprit.  So I do a codesudo kill -9/code on mds and then I can eject the disk.  Question: is this a bug or a feature? I haven't seen the need to kill mds documented anywhere.    <comment273802> I wonder if we should conclude that it is neither a bug nor a feature, but an implementation detail.  When people come to me with similar problems, sometimes ask them to try logging out.  I seem to recall reading that logging all users out will stop all Spotlight indexing, though today I can't find where I read it.
