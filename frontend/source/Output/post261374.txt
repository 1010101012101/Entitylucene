How to delete Time Machine backups from trash from another iMac? <body> So this is the situation.  I had a Time Machine backup of my old iMac. The backup drive became full. I deleted the old backups by moving them to the trash (because who tells you that that's not how you do it). My old iMac is now dead and doesn't turn on. Bought a new iMac and connected the backup drive. The deleted files are still in the trash. They can't be deleted from Finder. Have tried most of the Terminal commands I found on the web and they haven't worked.  How do I delete them?  If it's easier I think I will just copy the backup folder I need to another external hard drive and then just format my backup drive. I don't want to do a Time Machine restore anyway, I only transfer over the files I need onto my new mac.  Any suggestions?  <comment327316> "most of the Terminal commands..." specifically? We cannot see what you did, you have to tell us. Have you set the external drive to ignore ownership? <comment363961> **Have you set the external drive to ignore ownership?** How do you do that?. @Tetsujin <comment363962> Select the drive, Get Info, check the ignore ownership box.
