Help with resizing hard drive after failed Boot Camp <body> The other day I tried to install Windows 8.1 on my iMac (Mid-2011, 21.5 inch) running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1. The process froze halfway through, resulting in me losing 100 GB (which was suppose to be allocated for Windows) on my main Hard drive.  After running codediskutil list/code, my output isâ€¦  precode    /dev/disk0     #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER     0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0     1:                  Apple_HFS Mac HD                  399.2 GB   disk0s1 /code/pre  As you can see, I have codeFDisk_partition_scheme/code which is 500.1 GB and my main codeApple_HFS/code called, Mac HD which has all my files and folders, that is 399.2 GB. I wish to make my Mac HD ~500 GB so I can recover that 100 GB that has disappeared.  I also believe that I'm missing a Recovery HD. When I boot with codeCommand/code + codeR/code, I am shown a spinning globe which downloads some sort of outdated recovery (because it shows the old UI). Every time I boot my iMac, I booted into Windows side (somehow?) with the message of something similar "No disk found" etc.  Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!  hr  Output for codesudo fdisk /dev/disk0/code:  precodeDisk: /dev/disk0        geometry: 60801/255/63 [976773168 sectors] Signature: 0xAA55          Starting       Ending  #: id  cyl  hd sec -  cyl  hd sec [     start -       size] ------------------------------------------------------------------------  1: AF   25 127  15 - 1023 254  63 [    409640 -  779781456] HFS+          2: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        3: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused        4: 00    0   0   0 -    0   0   0 [         0 -          0] unused /code/pre  hr  Output for codesudo gdisk /dev/disk0/code:  precodeGPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.10  Warning: Devices opened with shared lock will not have their partition table automatically reloaded!

Very strange. <comment191862> please add the output from the command `sudo fdisk /dev/disk0` to the question - depending on the partition layout, there may not be enough space for a GPT <comment191884> start 409640, I think you accident deleted the EFI partition(200M), and the partition scheme change to MBR <comment191916> run `sudo gpt show /dev/disk1` and show the result <comment191918> sorry, `sudo gpt show /dev/disk0` <comment191925> @Noah I've check it, the partition information for your disk almost fine, except the first sector. from my side of view, it shows `start       size  index  contents`           `0          1         PMBR` <comment191932> @klanomath I understand. What do you think my best option is? If I end up using Recovery Mode, can I install OS X from USB/Harddrive? I can't really re-download ~3GB+. I also have a backup of my Home folder, so I can easily re-transfer all my settings, files and folders. All I want is, to have my HDD restored back with that 100 GB that I lost from re-partioning. <comment191933> @Noah First make a new full time machine backup. Give me a comment if you are finished <comment191943> @Noah I suggest you backup whole OS X system first via time machine. after that you can try GPT fdisk[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/], if failed, you can make a internet recovery and restore from your time machine. <comment192031> @nelson, can you explain to me what GPT fdisk does? How do I use it? <comment192087> @Noah Sorry I don't known more detail about it. <comment192280> @klanomath thanks a **ton** for your help. I restored from a backup yesterday and I now have a normal 500.11 GB Macintosh HD. The only thing I don't have is a Recovery HD. I found out from experience that I don't need one. If I have my backup disk plugged in it'll go a recovery mode stored on there (?)
