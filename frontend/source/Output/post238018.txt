Open a new Finder window in List mode with full name shown <body> Is it possible to open a new strongFinder/strong window in codeList Mode/code with the file name column stretched by default to always show the longest file name?  Oftentimes, I find myself having to double-click and adjust certain windows in order to properly view longer file names.   Is there any way to control and define this?  <answer238056> XtraFinder  Has lots of features, including visualization of Finder and auto-adjusting column width.
