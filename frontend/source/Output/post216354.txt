Did something wrong with partitioning my SSD <body> I tried to make a partition for Windows on my Mac by using Apple's emDisk Utility/em, because bootcamp already showed me that it didn't work for some reason. But now I'm stuck with a 70 gb hard disk, and I'm not capable of accessing the other part of the hard disk (I'm using a MacBook Air with 120 GB SSD).  I kind of expected emDisk Utility/em to let me change the name and everything for this new partition I made (intended for Windows), but for some reason, the only thing that happens is that I can't access the rest of my hard disk anymore and there are no more partitions available.  I hope I've made clear what the problem is, I'm not a native speaker (as you might have noticed) so it's a little hard to write a question about a subject like this.  Here is the output of codediskutil list/code:  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Macintosh HD            120.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.1 MB   disk0s3 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD           +120.1 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  732FEE77-68E5-4934-AEA2-EB01DE4EA90D                                  Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  <answer217103> I once had a simillar problem, the disk verification in disk util shown minors errors, but it wasn't able to fix them. As such, I couldn't delete a fat32 partition. Here is what I did :  ul lifirst i booted into safemode. The startup was long as it was fixing errors.

It worked this way./li /ul  However, You Should always do backups of your data, especially if you are messing with partitions   <comment262082> @coen Please edit your question if you want to add additional informations instead of answering. <comment262085> What kind of "hard disk utilities" did you use to partition your SSD? Apple's *Disk Utility*? <comment262384> okay, sorry! I just couldn't really get the codethingy done... I used Apple's Disk Utility indeed, nothing I have done so far has been done by a peer-made program <comment262390> The `diskutil list` output doesn't reflect the observations you made in your question. The output shows the default partition layout of a CoreStorage LVG with one LV( and a Recovery HD) occupying the whole ssd.
