Where does launchpad store folder information? (database, etc?) <body> So i've been searching around and trying to figure this out but can't seem to.  I know that the launchpad SQLite db is stored at code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/some-uuid.db/code (ref), but as best I can tell it doesn't seem to include any information about folders created in launchpad.  sDoes anyone know where this information is stored, and in what format?/s  strongEdit:/strong Found the location, details in my answer below. The only bits I can't figure out now are:  ul liHow to programatically create a new folder and move apps into it (using this db)/li lisWhat the codedb-shm/code and codedb-wal/code files are used for./s  ul liSQLite temp files (write ahead log &amp; shared memory files)/li /ul/li liWhether code~/Library/Application Support/Dock/some-uuid.db/code is used at all anymore, or if it was just leftover from an osx upgrade./li /ul  <answer237139> Ok, I think i've found it. Turns out that (at least under El Capitan) things are a little different.  This AskDifferent answer by Greg Hacke pointed me in the right direction.  It seems the databases are stored in code$TMPDIR/../0/com.apple.dock.launchpad/db//code, with the main sqlite db being aptly named codedb/code.  (After reading Geoff Hackworth's AskDifferent response, it seems a better way to get the path would be codegetconf DARWIN_USER_DIR/code rather than code$TMPDIR/../0//code)  Editing this with a sqlite GUI showed that the codegroups/code table stores the folders, with codetitle/code holding the folder name.  After making any desired changes, and writing them back to the db, we still need to do a codekillall Dock/code to refresh the launchpad screen.  Some observations:  ul liThere are a number of groups that don't have a codetitle/code (set to null), so not really sure what they are for./li liIt seems that just creating a new entry doesn't cause a group to show up (maybe because it would be an 'empty folder'?).  ul liIn this case, how can we create a new folder and move apps into it from the db?/li /ul/li liBy editing the codetitle/code field in the codeapps/code table we can change the display name of the app./li /ul
