Strange ACLs on OS X System <body> I have a folder on a HFS+ volume I can't delete. I already tried to get rid of the ACLs but somehow this doesn't worked out.  The folder is calles CrashPlan.app.  Here is what the terminal says:  precode    sh-3.2# ls -ahel@     total 0     drwxrwxr-x@ 3 root  admin   102B 23 Okt 22:58 .         com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked      3B          com.apple.s stem.Security     68B      drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel   102B 30 Okt 13:21 ..         com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeFSEventStoreUUID      36B          com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeLastFSEventID     20B          com.apple.backupd.SnapshotVolumeUUID      36B      drwxrwxr-x  2 jan   staff    68B 13 Nov  2012 CrashPlan.app      sh-3.2# cd CrashPlan.app/     sh-3.2# ls -ahel@     total 0     drwxrwxr-x  2 jan   staff    68B 13 Nov  2012 .     drwxrwxr-x@ 3 root  admin   102B 23 Okt 22:58 ..         com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked      3B          com.apple.s stem.Security     68B  /code/pre  Strange thing here is, if you look from the outer folder there are no ACL for the folder. But if you look from the inside there are.  How can that be and how I can get rid of it?  <answer115084> The codeCrashPlan.app/code does not have an ACL. The output of codels/code is consistent, you must have misread it.  ul liWhen you run codels -a/code in the parent directory, it tells you that code./code (i.e. the parent of codeCrashPlan.app/code) has extended attributes, and that codeCrashPlan.app/code has no ACL (mode string coderwxrwxr-x/code)./li liWhen you run codels -a/code inside codeCrashPlan.app/code, it tells you that code./code (i.e. the codeCrashPlan.app/code directory) has no ACL (mode string coderwxrwxr-x/code), and that code../code (i.e. the parent directory) has extended attributes./li /ul  The parent directory does not have an ACL, but it has extended attributes codecom.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked/code and codecom.apple.s stem.Security/code. This second attribute is odd: it should be codecom.apple.system.Security/code. This is a sign that your filesystem may be corrupted.  <answer161456> I had what appeared to be the EXACT same problem. The issue was with the system immutable flag on codeCrashPlan.app/code in my code.MobileBackups/code folder.  Actually, it was an old code.MobileBackups/code folder from a codePrevious System/code folder that was created during an "Archive and Install" of OS X, so I knew it was nothing I needed. It was completely inactive, but I couldn't delete it no matter what I tried.  This is what finally did it for me:  precodesudo find TopLevelFolder/ -flags +schg -exec chflags noschg {} \; /code/pre  Where codeTopLevelFolder/code is the folder containing (all of?) the offending codeCrashPlan.app/code folders. This removes the system immutable attribute which makes it possible to now delete the files.     As always, be very careful with coderm -rf/code, but running the following command next will then remove the files.   precodesudo rm -rf TopLevelFolder /code/pre  Where, again, codeTopLevelFolder/code is the same as the one above. I hope that helps someone else.  <comment274245> FWIW, I also have `com.apple.s stem.Security` in four files (actually directories), 44 bytes in size, on my SSD. In a previous dump of names and attributes, I had some files in /.MobileBackups that also had it, but some of those had 68-byte size; the 44-byte ones were mirrors of the above-mentioned, and the 68-byte ones were others. I bought the SSD in February of 2014 and have only formatted once. I'm not sure if those files came from my old drive with that attribute, or if it arose after that.
