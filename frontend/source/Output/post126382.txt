Installing extended offline dictation fails without error <body> I'm trying to download the offline dictation files but I only see the download window (screenshot) and after a while it disappears and the next time if I want to use dictation the same thing happens.  Is there some cache that I can try to clear so that it would download everything from scratch?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ch5Uw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126385> Please follow the instructions to remove a ?.plist file (it will be recreated automagically once you restart the system).  ol liPress these keys simultaneously: kbdshift/kbd+kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdG/kbd/li liIn the dialog box that appears after step 1, copy and paste the following /li /ol     ~/Library/Preferences   ol liHit return/enter/li liYou will be presented with a ton of files, but you should be able to find the /li /ol     com.apple.assistant.plist   ol liMove it to the Trash and Empty your Trash/li liOpen Dictation &amp; Speech preference panel and turn off dictation/li liRestart your computer/li liOpen Dictation &amp; Speech preference panel, turn on dictation/li liSelect Enhanced Dictation/li liDownload should begin and install correctly/li /ol  I hope this helps.  The file you are downloading is 750 meg, so it might take a while.  <comment148443> Same effect after this procedure. :-(
