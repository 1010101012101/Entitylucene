OS X 10.9.2 sending attachments <body> I am on a MacBook Pro using OS X 10.9.2, using Mail 7.2 If I try to send an attachment in mail, my finder does not allow me to access files.  I thought maybe it was just taking longer after the update to "adjust" however I left the finder open for 10 minutes and it still nothing.  I can see the folders, but not the contents of the folders.  I can access my files when I go directly through the finder, but not when accessing the finder through the mail.app  HELP!  <answer126506> You can start Disk Utility codeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility/code and click strongVerify Disk/strong and strongRepair Disk Permissions/strong.     However, it seems like a small bug. Just shut down your Mac and   restart it, the problem should be gone.   <comment148210> workaround: try dragging the file into the email directly from finder (doesn't answer the question but will let you send an important email for now) <comment148257> Yes, tried that.  The now the people I'm sending to say they're not getting any attachments.  ARRG! <comment148258> Ha ha.....of course that was the first thing I tried.
