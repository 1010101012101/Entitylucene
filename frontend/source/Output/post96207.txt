Issue with installing Windows 8 on an iMac <body> I own a MacBook Pro and a mid-2010 iMac.  I'm trying to install Windows 8 on a second partition on my iMac (currently running Snow Leopard), but I'm still having issues :  ul liI tried with BootCamp, but since my strongDVD drive is not working/strong, I cannot complete the process/li liThe BootCamp Assistant doesn't display the option of creating a strongbootable USB/strong (even though I tried to tweak its codeinfo.plist/code)/li liI tried creating a bootable USB flash, using Windows 7 USB Download Tool on my MacBook Pro which is also running Windows 8 (+ Mac OS X Mountain Lion), but I can't get it to work (I'm seeing the initial Boot menu, with kbdOption/kbd, but the flash drive doesn't show up; pressing kbdC/kbd on startup didn't work either)/li liTried strongbooting from a third partition/strong but I'm stuck at the point of restoring the .iso to the partition (now it sees the iso as corrupt :S - whatever...)/li listrongUsing Parallels/etc/strong is out of the question since I need the 64-bit Windows 8 version purely for Windows Phone Development purposes(and that would create issues with Hyper-V and Virtualization, regarding the Windows Phone Emulator)/li liI even tried using some Screen Sharing software (e.g. TeamViewer) but it lags + the resolution is not properly adjusted./li /ul  So, any ideas?  I'm willing to try emanything/em! (lol)  hr  strongP.S./strong I've been through all of this trouble only to be able to develop for Windows Phone (and thus, using Windows 8) on a bigger screen - and no, I don't have any cable for that (nor am I sure it's doable given that the iMac has no Thunderbolt port). So, if you have any suggestions on that, they're perfectly welcome!
