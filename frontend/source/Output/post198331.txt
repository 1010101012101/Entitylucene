Did Apple remove the zooming feature from the Magic Mouse in a recent OS update? <body> Mac OS X has a 'zoom' action which can be used in various views in applications e.g. Photos.app when looking at a photo, zooming an entire Safari page, zooming in an NSScrollView.  This action is easily performed on a trackpad by using the 'pinch' gesture.  I cannot for the life of me, work out how to enable it for the Magic Mouse (when running Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite).  The closest that I can get is in the 'Zoom' section of the 'Accessibility' pref pane.  This allows you to zoom the ementire screen/em which is not the behaviour that I'm looking for.  You used to be able to perform the zoom action using the mouse (see this video at 1:26 - https://youtu.be/UXbwOIsXNL8?t=1m26s )  So - have Apple removed this feature?  Or is there a way to enable in-app zooming with the Magic Mouse?  Thanks  <answer198338> If my trackpad wasn't working with gestures, I'd go to Zoom In Or Out is enabled in System Preferences-Trackpad- Scroll &amp; Zoom. If it is, I'd make sure Pinch With Two Fingers is selected.  Try this, but click on the Mouse pane in System Preferences.  <answer198345> I have the latest updates and a Magic Mouse and mine works fine, so I guess the answer would be no.  <answer198649> So - It appears that they did remove this feature in Yosemite.  <answer259336> Hold down cmd# while scroling then the magic mouse zooms.  <answer285836> On Sierra i found lovely hidden options!  Hold down CONTROL button to zoom the entire screen area  Hold down OPTION to use a zoom tool eg photoshop  <comment237287> Thanks, but there is no zoom gesture listed in the Mouse pref pane. <comment237294> Try disconnecting the Magic Mouse, then reconnecting it. Also, it might be in Trackpad, I'm not sure. <comment237297> still there in Mavericks ! <comment237298> Is it there in the Mouse pref pane?  If so - then you've answered my question... <comment237299> Yes it is. Be aware that some apps have they internal zooming actions, so the set up is not global. Try it with Preview to test. <comment237302> You can zoom in and out *within* an app just using the Magic Mouse (and a modifier key on the keyboard)?  i.e. not zooming the whole screen.
