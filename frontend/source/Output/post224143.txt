Turn off iPad on-screen keyboard using Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop Keyboard <body> I'm using Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop Keyboard with an iPad. This works great, except I'm not able to turn off the onscreen keyboard.  I understand that there is an eject button on the Apple Bluetooth keyboard that allows turning on and off the onscreen keyboard.  Is there a key combination that I can use to do the same on the Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Desktop Keyboard?    <answer237614> Microsoft doesn't officially support iOS with the Designer Keyboard. They actually list it on their website as non-functional with iOS. This strikes me as a very inconvenient step seeing as I am using it right now on the iPad Pro and it is hands down better than any other iPad keyboard I have used... other that that idiotic refusal to dismiss the virtual keyboard when in use!
