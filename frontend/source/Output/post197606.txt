Is there a way to hide the title bar of applications? <body> Is there anyway to hide the title bar aside from fullscreen mode?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G3sRt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer197610> I think the short answer is no.  TinkerTool is one of the best utilities out there for modifying the way your system appears/behaves. They do not have any options to remove the title bars from applications in general, although there is one setting to hide the title bar of windows in Quicktime X Player.  The longer answer would be for open-source applications you could potentially modify the code generating the UI.  <comment297788> I use iTerm2 and this is the final thing that pisses me off, How does Chrome hide it successfully :( ? <comment304564> Cocoa makes it easy to remove title bars, but the application designer has to choose to do it or provide the user with that option. In iTerm2, Preferences... Profiles-Window-"Style" popup menu choose "No Title Bar" <comment335448> @itsneo you can hide title bar in iTerm2 now btw, Profile-Window-Style: No Title Bar
