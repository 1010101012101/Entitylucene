Is it possible to change the "Quick Look" zoom modifier key? <body> On a Mac, while using Quick Look to briefly view the contents of a file (by pressing the kbdspace/kbd bar while the file is selected in Finder), one can use the kbdoption ⌥/kbd key to achieve two results, depending on the file type:  ol liConvert the scroll gesture into a convenient zoom. The user custom sets the zoom amount.  ul liFor example, if the file is a PDF./li /ul/li liThe kbdoption ⌥/kbd key instantly triggers a fixed zoom. Scrolling only affects the coordinates of the displayed area, and does not affect the zoom amount.  ul liFor example, if the file is a JPEG./li /ul/li /ol  Is it possible to change this key, from kbdoption ⌥/kbd to, for example, kbdcontrol ⌃/kbd?   The hotkey for Quick Look zoom is mysteriously absent from the "Zoom" sub-category within the "Accessibility" menu in System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rq5L7.png" alt="Accessibility menu"  <answer277154> To have strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  strongZoom/strong use eme.g./em strong^⌘8/strong, instead of strong⌥⌘8/strong as shown in the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6xfAo.png" alt="Image"  Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongKeyboard/strong  strongShortcuts/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  strongZoom/strong and change the emkeyboard shortcuts/em from the emdefault/em, as shown in the image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2hI3.png" alt="Image"  strongTo as shown in this image below:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tvwx6.png" alt="Image"  <comment350271> Thanks! Somewhat irrelevant question: Do you know the significance of "⌘8" or "⌘="? I mean, why are these peculiar key combinations the default? <comment350277> @rubik's sphere, You'd have to ask Apple why they made the default shortcuts for this what they did.
