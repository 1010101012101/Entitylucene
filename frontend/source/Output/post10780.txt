How can I empty the trash from the Terminal? <body> How can I empty the trash from the Terminal?  <answer10781> Trash is actually a hidden folder in the user's folder named code.Trash/code   If you delete it's contents, you empty the trash. You can use   precoderm -rf ~/.Trash/* /code/pre  Just be careful with it so you don't delete something else ;)  <answer10787> Another solution would be to create AppleScript containing the folowing code  precodetell application "Finder"     empty the trash end tell /code/pre  save it as codeemptytrash/code for example and execute it via codeopen emptytrash.app/code  or even better (as suggested by Chris) - execute:  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to empty' /code/pre  Since trash is a Finder thing, this should be more compatible in the long run.  <answer10788> A review of various command line tools, for managing the Trash from command line:  http://hasseg.org/blog/post/406/trash-files-from-the-os-x-command-line/  <answer177404> If you have Homebrew installed, you can easily install trash by typing:  precodebrew install trash /code/pre  Then, to empty the trash, you only have to type the following from the command line:  precodetrash -e /code/pre  It's a pretty little piece of software.  precode$ trash usage: trash [-ulesv] &lt;file&gt; [&lt;file&gt; ...]    Move files/folders to the trash.    Options to use with &lt;file&gt;:    -a  Use system API for trashing files instead of asking       Finder to do it. (Faster, but the 'put back' feature       in the Finder trash will not work if files are trashed       using this method.) Finder is still used for trashing       files you have no access rights for.   -v  Be verbose (show files as they are trashed, or if       used with the -l option, show additional information       about the trash contents)    Stand-alone options (to use without &lt;file&gt;):    -u  Check for updates (and optionally auto-update self)   -l  List items currently in the trash (add the -v option       to see additional information)   -e  Empty the trash (asks for confirmation)   -s  Securely empty the trash (asks for confirmation)    Options supported by `rm` are silently accepted.  Version 0.8.5 Copyright (c) 2010 Ali Rantakari, http://hasseg.org/trash /code/pre  <comment11271> But this will not delete .Trash on mounted media/network volumes. <comment11313> Directly from the command line: `osascript -e 'tell app "Finder" to empty'` (though you may want to put in a shell script to avoid having to get the syntax exactly right each time). <comment316949> @mspasov, in many cases that is a feature, not a bug.  In any case it also answers, "How can I empty just my local trash without unmounting my external volumes?"  ;)
