Using a VPN only for a specific mail account or app <body> On my iPhone, I know I can set up a VPN. But if I understand it correctly, it is a global setting. How can I use a VPN only when checking a specific IMAP account?  Alternatively, can it be activated on an app-by-app basis? It would be ok if every mail account used the VPN.  <comment78138> Is the mail server on the private network? <comment78140> No, but it won't authenticate connections coming from outside a certain IP range. The VPN's IP. <comment78141> Then I do not believe there is a way to accomplish this. Possibly with jailbreaking you can.
