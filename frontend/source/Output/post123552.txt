Outlook DB corruption <body> I have an exchange account set up in outlook which works fine until I connect to my work vpn. If I connect with outlook open, outlook loses it's connection to the server and will not reconnect. The only way to get it to connect again is to restore a backup of the database which is really annoying!  Any ideas as to what might be happening here?  Outlook 2011 on mbp running Mavericks. VPN is using Aventail client. No errors shown only not connected or hangs on connecting to...  <comment144309> insufficient information provided! any errors, what system, what os? all that and more maters to be able to answer your question <comment144869> What happens if you delete your existing Exchange account in Outlook, connect to the VPN, and re-create it? <comment144914> @nadyne Just tried that and it won't reconnect to Exchange that way either. <comment145100> My guess is that your corporate Exchange server uses different settings when connected via your corporate network (including VPN) than it does otherwise, and that your Exchange server isn't giving the right auto-discover settings for those two settings.  You're going to have to talk to your Exchange administrator to get this resolved. <comment145291> @nadyne Thanks for that I'll get on to IT and see if they can fix the problem. If I get a resolution I'll report back.
