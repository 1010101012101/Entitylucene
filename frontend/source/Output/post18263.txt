Can the Google+ app be installed on an iPod Touch? <body> I have a 3rd generation iPod touch with iOS upgraded to version 4.3.3. When installing the Google+ 1.0.1 app, it gives the message shown in the picture below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Eon6.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  emQuestion: Is there a generation or iOS version of iPod touch that will allow the Google+ app to be installed?/em  <answer18264> It's possible to install the app using the iPhone Configuration Utility. You first need to download Google+ using iTunes, then use the Configuration Utility to add the .ipa file to your device.  <answer18268> Not today.  It looks like the current app asks iTunes to require strongemGPS on iPhone/em/strong.   iPod Touch and even iPad with GPS are prevented from downloading the app directly and iTunes will not install it.  I don't know why iTunes doesn't tell you what specific devices the app strongemwill/em/strong work on rather than be a little vague about "not compatible with this device".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8w2v0.png" alt="iTunes message"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKHqu.png" alt="iOS store message"  <answer18350> I have the Verizon iPad 2 and it doesn't show up in my app store search at all.

The other alternative is a jailbreak to bypass these sort of restrictions. <comment19956> So then if `jailbreak` and the `iPhone Configuration Utility` are the only ways to install the google+ app, am I right in understanding that the google did not want for us to install google+ on the iPod touch? At least with version 1.0.1 <comment19962> Only Google knows why. Maybe they don't like the iPod touch? Or they just forgot that it's there? <comment19967> Publicly guessing motivation is tricky - there could be intention to roll it out further, but chose to develop and test a limited set of devices initially. Yes - the added test load for testing on iPod isn't as nearly as large as designing and testing a new layout on iPad - it still occupies limited development time, money and resources. Unless someone at google blogs about the decision, we can only watch and wait.... <comment19969> I have the Verizon iPad 2 and it doesn't show up in my app store search at all.

I'll copy my comment to an answer. <comment20053> @bmike Thanks. Seems like just iPhones with GPS then. <comment20126> Just realized they don't differentiate people with the same name on here <comment20127> Yeah - thomas 50 and thomas 6570 together had me going there for a moment :-) <comment160045> I have to laugh. I have an iPod touch that downloaded the app just fine. (iOS 7.1.1).
