OS X Recovery USB Stick doesn't recognize internal Hard Drive <body> I have a problem with my iMac. I don't know how or why, but my Boot partition, my OS X Recovery Partition or my EFI Partition got damaged. Now after hours of trying, I booted with Parted Magic and erased my complete two disks. Now a friend of mine brought me a bootable USB Stick with OS X Recovery. I booted from this and started Disk Utility, but he only recognizes one of my two Hard Drives.  My iMac has a 3 TB Fusion drive, so I have a SSD with ~128 GB and a HDD with ~2,8 TB. The SSD is recognized and showed in Disk Utility, but the 2,8 TB HDD not. codediskutil list/code also didn't show the HDD. In Parted Magic he shows also only the one SSD and no HDD.  iComputerfreak  strongEdit 1:/strong Resetting PRAM and Unplugging Power Cable and all devices for 60 Seconds didn't work too.  strongEdit 2:/strong Unplugging the Power Cable for a few Seconds worked now. I see my HDD in the Disk Utility App. But now when I try to format my Disk using codediskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ Untitled disk1/code I get this output:  precodeStarted erase on disk1 Unmounting disk Creating the partition map Waiting for the disks to reappear Formatting disk1s2 as Mac OS Extended (Journaled) with name Untitled newfs_hfs: write (sector 8594800): Invalid argument Mounting disk Could not mount disk1s2 with name (null) after erase Error: -69832: File system formatter failed /code/pre  After this, the HDD is disappeared again and not listed in codediskutil list/code. When I shut down, unplug my power cable, wait a few seconds and reboot, the HDD is back and listed in codediskutil list/code. I try now to format the both partitions disk1s1 and disk1s2 seperately.  strongEdit 3:/strong Deleting the partitions seperately didn't work too:  precodeStarted erase on disk1s1 EFI Unmounting disk Error: 6: POSIX reports: Device not configured /code/pre  <comment185451> ok question but close votes because question doesn't belong on SO , should probably be http://superuser.com/ , someone with powers can probably migrate <comment185533> Sorry. Thanks for migrating. <comment185764> Does no one have an idea? I tried for hours now... <comment185772> This question can bee closed. I think my HDD is irreparable damaged so I will bring it to Apple for repair... I hope that it's not too expensive...
