How can I switch between textmate and terminal quickly? <body> Is it possible to have a short cut so I can jump between Textmate and terminal quickly?  I know I can do it via cmd+tab but I still have to find it from the menu bar.  <answer118063> If you're on OS X Lion or later, you can place the two applications on neighboring spaces. Then use gestures to switch between them. I know terminal supports full screen; not sure about TextMate, though.  Make sure you turn off auto-arrangement in the Mission Control preferences, if you wish. This can effect the order of your apps. I find it annoying.  <answer118076> There are a couple of ways doing this.  The quickest and easiest is to use codeSpaces/code.  Put codeTextmate/code on codeDesktop 4/code and codeTerminal/code on codeDesktop 3/code  Then you can use kbdctrl/kbd-kbdoption/kbd and either kbd3/kbd or kbd4/kbd to switch between the two.  Personally I use codeKeyboard Maestro/code for this. I used to use a codeService/code and a keyboard shortcut but a "feature" of the new security system makes it impossible for a Service to use the System Event library unless you turn on codeaccessibility/code for every app. You need that to select "Bring All to Front".  <answer118082> If you use Alfred and have the powerpack, setting up a workflow to switch to a specific application is easy.  ol liOpen Alfred's Preferences./li liClick the Workflows button./li liAdd a new, blank workflow using the '+' button at the bottom of the window./li liFill in the Workflow name, for example "Switch to Terminal" and any other info you want and click Save./li liUsing the round '+' button in the top right corner, add a hotkey from the Triggers menu./li liSet the Hotkey to whichever key combination you want to use. Leave the other defaults./li liAgain using the round '+' button, add an action 'Launch Apps / Files'/li liFind Terminal in the Finder and drag it into the empty list and click Save/li liConnect the Hotkey command to the Launch action by moving the mouse pointer over the side of the hotkey and clicking and dragging the small 'knob' that appears over to the launch action./li /ol  Do the same for TextMate and you're done, having two shortcuts to switch to the application you want. (Yes, the action says launch, but if an app is already open Alfred will switch to it instead.)  <answer118088> I use iTerm2 for this. It can be configured to open and close a terminal window using a hotkey.  My setup is such that tapping kbdCtrl/kbd twice brings up a full-screen terminal window with slightly transparent background, so that I can see what's behind it. Tapping kbdCtrl/kbd twice again hides the window.  <answer118134> I currently use KeyRemap4MacBook to assign shortcuts to applications. For example this private.xml would make F7 open iTerm and control-option-command-M open TextMate:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;&lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM&lt;/name&gt;&lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/iTerm.app&lt;/url&gt;&lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;&lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_TEXTMATE&lt;/name&gt;&lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/TextMate.app&lt;/url&gt;&lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F7 | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_ITERM&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::M, VK_CONTROL | VK_OPTION | VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_TEXTMATE&lt;/autogen&gt;  &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  If you have bought the Powerpack for Alfred, you can create a workflow like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XPUNO.png" alt=""  Hotkeys have a short delay by default, but you can reduce it by changing the trigger behavior:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wAukF.png" alt=""
