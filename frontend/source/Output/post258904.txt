Calendar events time show TIME and GMT+N <body> Why my calendar shows local time strongAND/strong GMT+N hours? How can I get rid of this codeGMT+N/code addition?  In the red box you can see how time of events is displayed in my calendar. Below is the part of System Preferences  Language &amp; Region  Advanced Tab settings.  I tried to turn Time Zone Support On and Off - no difference.  macOS version Sierra 10.12.1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wtH6C.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment324399> What is your timezone? <comment324401> Currently it is CET (Central European Time), UTC/GMT +1 hour. We've switched one hour back yesterday. Before yesterday it was GMT + 2. <comment324405> So GMT+2 is the correct timezone for the time you tool the screenshot? <comment324406> Yes, this is right.
