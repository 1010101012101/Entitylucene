Tool to quickly hide/blur/redact text in screenshot? <body> Iâ€™ve captured a screenshot and I want to share it (on Stack Overflow, actually), but I need to blur/hide out a couple words in the screenshot. Is there a tool to quickly do this?   <answer72972> Skitch can do this quickly. See?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5SDHN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Just click the blur button in the side bar and draw over your image to obscure things.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ixmAk.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please note that this app saves files to Evernote by default which can be a problem for sensitive content. You may want to disable it by not signing into your Evernote account or by making the following setting changes:  ul liSet codeSync -&gt; Save New Skitch Notes to Evernote/code to codeManual/code/li liUncheck codeSharing -&gt; Automatically Share and Copy Link after creating new Skitch Notes/code/li /ul  <answer72973> You can use Preview in two ways:  ul liUse the Annotation tool to draw a filled rectangle over the area you want to hide. You can select the fill color./li liUse the Selection tool to select the area you want to hide and then emcut/em it. The area will be replaced by a gray area (or whatever color is set as window background in Preferences/General)./li /ul  <answer116231> Check out facepixelizer.com.  It has an "intelligent" text blurring tool that changes the amount of blurring based on the font size of the text being blurred.  It's an online web app and it's free.

Brilliant app. Set fill to saturation, opacity 14, black background, background blur 2px. Save it as a style.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTPAN.png" alt="enter image description here"  Here's the settings:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jhAPd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer191597> I use reducked.com - small webpage-tool for redacting images in a browser.  strongUPD:/strong TheBro21, that's a one task tool, their home page is a tutorial in 3 sentences: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sE7s9.png" alt="3 steps"  and as a result: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pohpw.png" alt="result"  <answer240594> I was looking for a quick solution using the preview tool as well and blocking out or cutting text won't work (since I need to give the notion that text goes there).  I ended up just downloading and using GIMP because of it's flexibility as a tool.  There are two ways to blur:  1) Simply use the blur tool and drag over the text.  If you want to be cleaner, you can use the rectangle selection tool first and then use blur so you get sharper edges.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q2c8z.png" alt="enter image description here"  2) There is also an option in the toolbar to blur selection as well (so it's more evenly blurred) - I would recommend a high (15x15) gaussian blur (strongemFilters - Blur - Gaussian Blur.../em/strong from the menu). Select the area you want to blur first and then use the appropriate blur filter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4129S.png" alt="enter image description here"  Again, I know it's not as simple and direct as some of the other tools, but GIMP just offers a lot of other features built pretty well. In my case, I downloaded it and used it for blurring of text since I know I'll be using it for other capabilities in the future. Preview fits a lot of great simple annotations, I was surprised it didn't have this built in.  <comment170172> I was preparing to [install a whole app](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/72972/1595) to blur 1 image, 1 time. This answer was very fast instead. <comment219082> For sensitive content, skitch is a REALLY BAD idea. If you're blurring an image, generally you don't want the image distributed to a large crowd. Skitch uploads saved images to Evernote. Cloud services are a really bad idea for sensitive content. <comment219107> @Arion easily disabled in Skitch's preferences. See the `Sharing` pane, uncheck `Automatically Share and Copy Link after creating new Skitch Notes`. You can also remove all accounts. Having an Evernote account is not required to use Skitch (I don't and it works fine for me). <comment219118> Nice! I switched `Sync - Save New Skitch Notes to Evernote` to `Manual`. <comment227612> Your reccome dation is appreciated. But please add a tutorial to how to use reducked. <comment289782> AWESOME! 6moretogo. <comment292238> This works, but for real sensitive data, it's probably a bad idea. <comment367911> [Skitch is also available on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch-snap-mark-up-send/id490505997?mt=8)!
