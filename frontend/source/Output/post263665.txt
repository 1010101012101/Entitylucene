Group fonts by font family in Font Book <body> I recently added a few new font families to Font Book, including one called 'gotham'. The gotham family contains several different fonts, (e.g., 'gotham bold', 'gotham condensed', 'gotham light', etc.) and I'd like them to all group underneath the 'gotham' font family.  For example, I also installed the 'lato' font family recently, and all of lat's "sub-fonts" group underneath lato like files inside of a folder.  I installed all of these through the same process with Font Book.  Because the gotham fonts and others aren't grouping this way, they're showing up as a million different fonts all over my system, and it's really cluttered. I see options in Font Book to create new "Collections", "Smart Collections", and "Libraries", but I don't think I want any of those.  Can I re-organize fonts this way? Could there be something different about the source files/folders I used to add these fonts that would produce this difference?
