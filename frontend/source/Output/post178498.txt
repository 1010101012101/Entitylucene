Incoming call is not registered on iPhone if iPhone turns of before I pick up <body> The situation:  ol liiPhone is low on battery/li liI receive incoming call/li liI try to pick up and phone turns of during that moment/li /ol  In this situation incoming phone number is not registered on the recent call list.  Is there a way to fix this?  <comment211394> Charge your phone more often. It obviously isn't getting time to log the call details. <comment211444> Well it could be ringing for 5-15sec, but only when I pickup it turns off. Probably, because it draws more current at that point. So technically it has enough current and time to register a call before that, but I was wondering if there is something in the settings to get that working. I don't remember having this problem a year back, it's either related to iOS update or a change of mobile operator.
