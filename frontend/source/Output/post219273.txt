Transcend Jetdrive vs OWC Aura <body> I've just bought a used 2012-era MacBook Air (model MacBookAir5,2).   I'm considering upgrading the SSD using a Transcend Jetdrive or an OWC Aura.  Going by their specs, both devices are the same. Right now the only difference I can see is the cost and time needed for shipping, but I'm more interested in knowing if there are long term benefits of one over the other technically wise in terms of speed/durability/other.  How can I determine the better SSD - not the cheapest?  <answer220970> While I'm a big fan of OWC normally, I would go with the Transcend Jetdrive 725. That's what I just ordered for my Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina.  The main reason I did not go with the OWC Auro drive is I've had a couple of friends who've upgrade their systems to the OWC Auro drive have problems. While they were both happy at first, at least one of them had their OWC Aura drive, for a Mid-2012 Macbook Pro Retina, die after 6 months of use. The other friend complained about their Macbook Air running hotter after the upgrade (not sure if they screwed up their upgrade) and having drive issues as a result. There are also other stories floating around the web about the OWC Auro drives failing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_sK0336Hto.  The Transcend Jetdrive 725 comes with a 5 year warranty for the same price as the OWC Auro, which only has a 3 year warranty. The OWC Auro Pro version does have a 5 year warranty, but is more expensive than the Transcend at that point.  Plus, the Transcend 725 drive now has TRIM support under the latest Mac OS (thanks to Apple). On the other hand, OWC recommend that you DON'T enable TRIM support with their drives.     em"In fact, enabling TRIM could actually hurt the performance and reliability of your OWC SSD, rather than help it./em"   I hope this helps in your decision making process.  <answer276177> For what it's worth, I'm having problems with OWC Aura Pro drives in my mid-2011 Macbook Air 13.  I bought the 512gb model in March 2016. It worked until last December, when it failed.  OWC sent a replacement promptly.  This past weekend, that drive failed.  I have now sent it back to OWC for examination.  My guess is that they will send me a warranty replacement.  I am planning to buy a Transcend drive or just get a new machine.  Having hard drive failures every few months is not acceptable.   <comment265201> I'll suggest two things: I use a Samsung 850 Evo in my windows box and 850 Pro in my MacBook. Both are excellent and work well with good support. Secondly, questions based solely on price are off topic here. You may want to rephrase your question to reflect the actual specs you are looking for to generate better answers <comment265206> @agentroadkill Thanks. Evo SSDs are not compatible at all with the MacBook Air 5,2, which used M.2 SSDs, not 2.5in SSDs.  I'm not asking a question about the price. As the Jetdrive and Aura's specs are practically identical on paper, the only major difference being price, I wanted to know how they compare in the real world, so I can get the one that performs the best. <comment265208> I would like to [politely disagree](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TGIVZTW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awd_aNfBwbKPSD2F8). What comparison metrics are you looking for? Outright read/write speed? Longevity? Encryption support? <comment265209> Thanks for that link. I did a quick Google and only found references to the 2.5in Evo SSD. The R/W speed of the Aura and Jetdrive are practically identical, their storage amount is the same, they both claim to be fully compatible with Macs, which implies encryption is supported, and they seem to have similar expected lifespans (going by their warranties). As I've said: on paper they're practically identical. So I'd like to know how they perform in real life. <comment265213> @agentroadkill Thanks for the Evo link. It does look good, but its specs are broadly identical to the Aura and Jetdrive. Its major differentiator is HW encryption, but that doesn't appear to play well with Macs - if at all. <comment265216> The problem is you appear to be asking primarily for anecdotal evidence. I can tell you my Samsung works well, but have no basis for the other two. You'd be better served reading reviews of the products you're considering than posing your question here <comment265249> @agentroadkill I did look for reviews. The only comparison reviews were not in English, making them useless for me: that is why I asked if anyone knew if one was better than the other. Thanks for the info about the Evo though. <comment274196> This is very late in the day, but thanks for your answer. I eventually went with the Jetdrive version. It's worked out well so far. <comment304496> Also a bunch of reviews on amazon for the owc aura drive for 2013 macs are indicating multiple failures. <comment363683> I'm sorry to hear that. I eventually went with the Transcend Jetdrive, and haven't had a problem with it.
