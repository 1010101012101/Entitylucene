Macbook Pro (March 2011) - Bootcamp Windows crashes when monitor is plugged in <body> I have a really annoying issue when plugging in an external monitor into my macbook where the computer just freezes. All screens go black, the apple and keyboard are lit up, even if the lid is closed and the only way to recover is to press and hold the power button.  The monitor is a 27" Acer (B27h) and it's plugged in via DVI cable and DVI to mini display port adapter. I have tried swapping to a different adapter and didn't seem to help.   On average this would happen two to three times out of five. I have tried different sequences of opening the lid and plugging in the monitor(plug in first, then open or vice versa) without much luck.  Is there anything I can to make this go away?
