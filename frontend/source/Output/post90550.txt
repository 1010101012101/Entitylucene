First, find a flash drive that's compatible with the Camera Connection Kit (i.e. doesn't draw more than 100 mA).   Create a directory in the root of the USB drive named codeDCIM/code. Inside codeDCIM/code create a directory that has strongexactly/strong 8 characters. Put your picture/video files inside this directory, ensuring that they have an 8.3 pattern filename (e.g. codesomepics.jpg/code).   You'll end up with a directory structure that looks like this:  pre USB drive root   -\DCIM     -\FAKECAM1       -\pict0001.jpg       -\pict0002.jpg ... /pre  <answer93067> Connect the ipad usb cord to your Ipad and  computer, get a flash drive, connect as well to your computer.
