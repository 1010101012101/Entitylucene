Always show hidden in Open/Save dialogs <body> Is it possible to set by default to show hidden files and folders in Open and Save dialogs ?  I know it is possible to trigger to show hidden for dialog lifetime by press kbdCommand ⌘/kbd+kbdShift ⇧/kbd+kbd./kbd.  <answer65423> Not without using the codechflags nohidden/code command, which is not recommended.  One of the third-party file manager utilities such as PathFinder may have such an option.  <answer65445> In the terminal enter  precodedefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 /code/pre  <answer99216> I just asked this question again, since there were no real answers here, and according to this answer all you need to do is run  precodedefaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles -bool true /code/pre  and restart whichever application(s) you're using, and you're all set. No restarting Finder or your computer. Brilliant!  <comment76865> chflags nohidden work only for Finder, not Open/Save dialogs. Also I don't see how PathFinder can help. <comment76939> This will work only when you browsing through Finder itself, my question is when you browsing through Save or Open dialogs in any other application. <comment76966> chflags nohidden should affect file dialogs as well, but it can't be used to show files that start with a period. <comment116719> This is not work. <comment116833> It works on Mountain Lion 10.8.4, I don't know about other versions. You may also need to use `sudo` at the beginning of the command <comment116867> Tried again, it works but not everywhere, it is depends on application.. in TextEdit for example not. <comment166016> @dimdeep MattDMo's answer worked for me
