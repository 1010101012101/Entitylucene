Windows are slightly "transparent" in such a way I can see underlying windows show through slightly to the current window <body> I don't know how to explain it too well. Here are some places I see this happen: On the Minecraft main menu, I can see through to the desktop, While watching a youtube video (in full screen) I can see remnants of the previous page, etc.  How the heck do I fix this? It is really bugging me.  EDIT: It appears to be because of the hardware, since this also happens under Ubuntu.  <answer169292> That's one of the "features" of the Mac O/S that I always thought, "what were they thinking?" Unfortunately I don't have an answer to that but to your question:  Go to System Preferences - Accessibility - Display  look for two check boxes: Increase Contrast and Reduce Transparency.  Adjust either or both to get your desired effect, that is not seeing the stuff behind a window.  <comment198831> If he's seeing artifacts while watching full screen video, theres something wrong. That's not a feature. <comment198989> Hmmmm... I took this to mean the artifacts you get when transparency was turned on. But yeah if that is happening more is wrong than just a setting. <comment199097> If you create a new user account, do you get the weird behavior there? <comment199710> @samh yes. I have also noticed I get this under Ubuntu.
