Citrix on OS X - GlobalSign certificate errors <body> I trying to access a work Citrix server using my MacBook pro. I can log in fine with a windows machine, but when I try from my mac I get an error.  What should I do to fix this? I have't found much information via Google.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dqbgs.png" alt="Error message"  <answer95306> It looks like you forgot to install the intermediate SSL Certificate on your server.
