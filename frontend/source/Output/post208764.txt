Can't write to /usr/lib <body> I upgraded to OS X El Capitan and tried to install a new app (MPLAB X from Microchip) but I got an error because it couldn't copy a library to code/usr/lib/code even when it asked for root password. I tried to manually copying the library using codesudo cp libSEGGERAccessLink.dylib /usr/lib/code but it says codecp: /usr/lib/libSEGGERAccessLink.dylib: Operation not permitted/code.  Is this a permission issue? How can I write to code/usr/lib/code?  codels -ld /usr/lib/code returns:   precodedrwxr-xr-x  263 root  wheel  8942 Oct  2 15:49 /usr/lib /code/pre  <answer208767> It is a new feature of OS X 10.11 (El Capitan): SIP.

I know it's a deprecated library but we need it for Android development... <comment254859> @rokjarc I don't know, didn't use them but I just disabled SIP, installed MPLAB X and enabled it again. <comment254943> @Andres: i guess that is the only way at the moment, tnx <comment265198> Thanks helped me out after several hours trying to install PsN 4.4.8 under El Capitan. Just shifted the installation to usr/local/bin.
