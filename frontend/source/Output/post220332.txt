cv2 module not found <body> I installed OpenCV 2.4.X using Homebrew on my MacBook Pro OS X El Capitan, but when I try to run a program in Python 2.7.X I get this error:  precodeImportError: No module named cv2 /code/pre  I have looked everywhere and tried everything, it still won't work. When I type codepython -c "help('modules')"/code into the terminal, cv2 is listed. Any ideas why this is happening?  When I try to import cv2 I get it as an option, but when I choose it, it's not recognised:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ERJ6.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a reason cv and cv2 have different icons?
