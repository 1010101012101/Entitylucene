Rebooting the MBP in recovery mode <body> When I reboot with Control-R pressed as suggested by many, I see the spinning wheel for more than half hour and the laptop does not show the recovery options. I have Yosemite and want to go back to Mavericks for various reasons. Any suggestions.  <answer162773> I assume that was a typo.  It is not Control-r it is the command-r to get in to recovery mode.  In order to get back to Mavericks you will need the Mavericks Installer file on a USB stick.
