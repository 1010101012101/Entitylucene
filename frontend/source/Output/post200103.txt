6TB drive in Macpro 2008/2010 <body> The 6TB drives have changed their mounting hole configuration. Has any vendor introduced a bracket for the 2008-2010 Macpro (I know these are different from each other, I own both) to handle this? On sites such as OWC, I see warnings, but no solution offered.   For what it's worth this article discusses - 6TB HDDs Causing Problems for System Vendors - But Not the Way You Think  <answer200108> http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MPRODBKTLG6/  emNB - OWC Hard Drive Sled / Bracket for Mac Pro 2009, 2010-2012 'Westmere' &amp; 'Nehalem' Models ONLY, (not for Mac Pro 2006-2008 Models)/em     h1OWC Hard Drive Bracket/h1      strongfor Mac Pro (2009-2012)/strong        Updated for 2015, the OWC Hard Drive Bracket is the new universal standard to install any SATA hard drive in a Mac Pro tower, including the latest 6.0TB SATA hard drives which feature the new industry-standard mounting screw pattern. With screw mounting holes for all SATA drives, it's the drive sled built for compatibility, flexibility, and ease of use.

I have 2 6TB WD blacks sitting in 2 drive sled.  For majority 6TB drive (mostly seagate model), you need OWC drive sled mentioned above.  Some of folks have also successfully installed 6TB drive (WD red model) in their mac pro, check #14 post. .  http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-tb-drives-do-not-work-fit-in-mac-pro-now-what.1825187/  It's nice since WD still retain old mounting hole with 6TB drives. So it's safe to purchase 6TB model of WD black or red. WD green probably same, but i don't know since i don't have that drive.  <comment241118> Glad you told me before i bought one! BTW, empirically, the Pro 3,1 & 4,1 have different drive-holders. Though they look the same, they're not interchangeable, I think the SATA slots come out to be different heights & won't slide in. <comment241146> Clearly, my search skills are lacking. Strange, OWC gives the warning, but didn't bother linking to the right bracket. Again, thanks. (At least the question might serve as an alert for the issue itself.) <comment241148> I've been practising for my black belt in Google-Fu... ;) Seriously, yes, it's odd they don't link to a necessary compatible component. Maybe give them a shout.
