Using Applescript to paste the current date into a range of Excel cells <body> I have a simple script written that successfully saves the current date in the format I need. I also have saved a destination range in the active sheet. I just need syntax to paste/insert it into that range of cells.  pretell application "Microsoft Excel"     get active workbook     tell sheet 1         set ReportDate to do shell script "date '+%d/%m/%Y'"         set range_value to value of used range         set firstUnusedCellA to (count range_value)         set DestinationRange to "G2:G" &amp; (firstUnusedCellA)         get ReportDate         paste special on worksheet active sheet destination range DestinationRange  codeend tell /code/pre  <answer179201> I think the code below speaks for itself. The do shell script command shouldn't be used inside another application tell block. Still I prefer a vanilla AppleScript solution as below which is fine to be used in any context in the script.   precodetell (current date) to set {_day, _month, _year} to {day, it's month, year} set _day to text -2 thru -1 of ("00" &amp; _day) -- add leading zeros if needed set _month to text -2 thru -1 of ("00" &amp; (_month as integer)) -- add leading zeros if needed set _date to _day &amp; "/" &amp; _month &amp; "/" &amp; _year  tell application "Microsoft Excel"     tell workbook 1         tell worksheet 1             set value of range "$A1:A10" to _date         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment212381> I tried it and it results in a error message. "Are you sure you want to do this -today" ? <comment212419> Thanks for the help dj bazzie wazzie. With your suggested code I was able to get it to work.
