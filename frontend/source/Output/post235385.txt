How can I open a Terminal window directly from my current Terminal location? <body> Related to How can I open a Terminal window directly from my current Finder location?, I would like to have a terminal window open in one location, and open another one.  E.g. under Linux, I could be in ~/foo/bar/files/ in one terminal window, and type Ctrl-Shift-N and a new window would open at that same location.  In Mac OS X, I can only do ⌘N which opens a new terminal in my home directory. Is there any way to open the new terminal in the current directory?  <answer235396> Simply change the Terminal settings Terminal - Preferences - Startup - New windows open with: emSame Working Directory/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pd5gt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment287909> Damn, looked right at it and didn't see it. Thank you! <comment287910> Interesting … it only works if the terminal is at a shell prompt. Well, I can live with it. <comment304863> OK, I think I figured that last issue out -- the shell writes the current PWD into the title bar, and I think terminal window is using that information to figure out where to place a new window. If an app has changed the title bar label (and I've programmed vim to do just that), then the terminal window app can't figure it out.
