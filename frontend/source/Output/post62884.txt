iCal events missing problem <body> I have recently updated my Mac OS X to 10.8 version. The iCal application is changed as "Calendar" app in OS X 10.8. The problem here is, I lost all data which I stored in iCal. Any suggestions to retrieve those data's?  Thanks  <comment72559> Did you have your calendar in iCloud or Gmail? Or just stored localy? <comment72563> I just stored locally :( <comment72573> Do you have a backup...Time Machine, for example? <comment72692> No, I did not use Time Machine and all. I stored events only in iCal. Also, I lost all my stickies :(
