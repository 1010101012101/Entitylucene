How to fix macOS Sierra language switching bug? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CLxnw.gif" alt=""  Changing languages input does not work, you can see the video.  <answer263900> Go to system preferences/Siri and turn off Siri and make sure that the keyboard shortcut is set to None, and then restart.  <answer290928> This bothered me for almost a whole year. It turns out a very bad and messy design plus bugs caused the widespread frustration.  Solution is to only use the correct behaviors (stronghereafter quoted as below/strong):  In input settings, I enabled switching input method by Caps-lock key. When everything works fine, here are the behaviors should be:  h2Correct behaviors/h2  Using caps-lock to switch Chinese input method and English. That means:  ol liwhen using Chinese, press caps-lock will turn input method to English/li liwhen using Chinese, long press caps-lock will turn input method to Capital English, green light will be on in Apple Magic Keyboard./li liwhen using English, long press caps-lock to switch to Capital English, long press caps-lock to go back/li liwhen using English(whether Capital or not), press caps-lock to switch to Chinese/li /ol  h2Incorrect behaviors/h2  h3first(very common)/h3  ol lipressing caps-lock does switch input method, but the indicator in menubar doesn't change accordingly at all./li /ol  h3second(very common)/h3  ol lipressing caps-lock does not switch input method any more. But cmd+space still works. menubar indicator works as well. /li /ol  h3third(less common)/h3  ol lipress caps-lock and cmd+space both don't work. I have to use mouse to click the menubar indicator to switch input method./li /ol  h3fourth(rare)/h3  ol lipress caps-lock and cmd+space both don't work.

You are just cataloging how it is supposed to work and then how if often does not work.  When it does not work right, what are you supposed to do to fix it?   Using "correct behavior" is not an option when you are faced with "incorrect behavior". <comment369754> apparently OP doesn't have Siri. <comment369756> @TomGewecke agree, but IMHO sort out things is a bit more helpful than a unrelated "solution". <comment369758> happens once in a while, have to restart OS. <comment369768> @georgexsh why do you think that? <comment369769> Your stuff is really addressed to Apple, not to anyone with a concrete problem to solve.  Instead of posting it here, send it to http://www.apple.com/feedback <comment369967> hmm, it is possible, I was wrong.
