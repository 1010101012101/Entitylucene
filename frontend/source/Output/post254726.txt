Hadoop gives connection refused <body> I installed Hadoop v2.7.3 on my MacBook Pro (mid 2012), running OS X El Capitan (v10.11.6)  Using this link - http://mac.thetutorialfree.com/2015/11/21/how-to-install-apache-hadoop-on-mac-os-x-10-11-el-capitan-step-by-step-guide/  All Hadoop commands were working fine, except this:  precodehadoop fs -ls /code/pre  This returns an error:  precodels: Call from shreyas-macbook-pro.local/172.31.238.106 to localhost:8020 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException : Connection refused; For more details see: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused /code/pre  A similar problem in this site was solved by enabling Remote Login in   precodeSystem Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Remote Login /code/pre  Which I have already done. Also,   precodetelnet localhost 8020  /code/pre  doesn't work. It gives an error:  precodeTrying ::1... telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused Trying 127.0.0.1... telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused telnet: Unable to connect to remote host /code/pre  I am stumped, so if anybody could help me figure out what the problem was, it would be great.  <comment324120> Did you setup `hadoop.tmp.dir` in `core-site.xml`? If so, did you run 'hadoop namenode -format'? Run `jps` and update your question with its result.
