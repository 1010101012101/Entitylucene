Can't boot into Mac OS after Windows install via Bootcamp <body> I just installed Windows 10 successfully via BootCamp. Now I am neither able to boot into OSX, nor is its partition shown anywhere.  Turns out the issue occurs because of a mistake I made during the Windows installation. Once Bootcamp created the BOOTCAMP partition and restarted the system, I noticed that there was an additional small-sized partition created (~600 MB) just before the BOOTCAMP partition. Instead of ignoring it, I deleted and recreated the bootcamp partition from Windows Setup. Now I am only able to boot into Windows 10.  Now my question is: How can I recreate the deleted partition in order to be able to reboot into OS X?  I booted into Recovery Mode using cmd + r and ran codediskutil list/code. Here is the outcome:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShDhI.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Besides, the Macintosh HD partition is also shown in Disk Utility:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFMxE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The Recovery Mode even gives me the option to boot into my Mac partition, but doing so results in a black screen.  I am grateful for any suggestions out of this misery.  hr  Edit 1  Output of codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code  precodebash-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0     start      size index contents         0         1       PMBR         1         1       Pri GPT header         2        32       Pri GPT table        34         6        40    409600     1 GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640 408928144     2 GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 409337784        72 409337856     32768     3 GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE 409370624  80863232     4 GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 490233856       863 490234719        32       Sec GPT table 490234751         1       Sec GPT header /code/pre  Output of `diskutil cs list  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 017D5AE8-30F7-45E1-879E-BB02C0EC3DC1     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         209371209728 B (209.4 GB)     Free Space:   35655680 B (35.7 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume FB261C56-1F49-4690-9B15-8C4EAA4770B0     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     209371209728 B (209.4 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family A62719EC-A4E5-4821-B7E0-831444CC3...         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume D0DEC2A0-0E60-49B1-9758-40E7677A5346              Disk:                  disk2              Status:                Online              Size (Total):          209000005632 B (209.0 GB)              Conversion Progress:    -none-              Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)              LV Name:               Macintosh HD              Volume Name:           Macintosh HD              Content Hint:          Apple_HFS` /code/pre  <answer204569> The small partition you've deleted is your on-board Recovery HD. But deleting it isn't the real reason why you can't boot. You hosed your GUID partition table by manipulating it from inside Windows 10.  The basic steps you have to execute are:  strongPreparation:/strong    ul liDetach any external drive (especially an external Time Machine backup drive)./li liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.br The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot to a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an apple/akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (Mavericks or Yosemite) or a thumb drive containing a full system (Mavericks or Yosemite)./li /ul  strongModify GUID partition table:/strong  ul liOpen in the menubar Utilities/Terminal/li /ul  First you should get an overview of your disks and the partition layout:  ul liEnter codediskutil list/code, codediskutil cs list/code and codegpt -r show /dev/disk0/code  diskutil list:  precodebash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME               SIZE      IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partItion_scheme                   *251.0 GB  disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                209.7 MB  disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage                    209.4 GB  disk0s2    3:         Microsoft Reserved                     16.8 MB  disk0s3    4:       Microsoft Basic Data BOOTCAMP            41.4 08  disk0s4 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME               SIZE      IDENTIFIER    0:     Apple_partition_scheme                     *1.3 GB  disk1    1:        Apple_partition_map EFI                 30.7 KB  disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System     1.3 GB  disk1s2 /dev/disk2    #:                       TYPE NAME               SIZE      IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD      *209.0 GB  disk2  /dev/disk3 - /dev/disk13 part of the Recovery System /code/pre  diskutil cs list:  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil cs list CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 017D5AE8-30F7-45E1-879E-BB02C0EC3DC1     =========================================================     Name:         Macintosh HD     Status:       Online     Size:         209371209728 B (209.4 GB)     Free Space:   35655680 B (35.7 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume FB261C56-1F49-4690-9B15-8C4EAA4770B0     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk0s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     209371209728 B (209.4 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family A62719EC-A4E5-4821-B7E0-831444CC3...         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Encryption Type:         None         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         Conversion Direction:    -none-         Has Encrypted Extents:   No         Fully Secure:            No         Passphrase Required:     No         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume D0DEC2A0-0E60-49B1-9758-40E7677A5346              Disk:                  disk2              Status:                Online              Size (Total):          209000005632 B (209.0 GB)              Conversion Progress:    -none-              Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)              LV Name:               Macintosh HD              Volume Name:           Macintosh HD              Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  gpt -r show /dev/disk0:  precodebash-3.2# gpt -r show /dev/disk0     start      size index contents         0         1       PMBR         1         1       Pri GPT header         2        32       Pri GPT table        34         6        40    409600     1 GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640 408928144     2 GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 409337784        72 409337856     32768     3 GPT part - E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE 409370624  80863232     4 GPT part - EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7 490233856       863 490234719        32       Sec GPT table 490234751         1       Sec GPT header /code/pre/li liUnmount the CoreStorage volume first and then the main disk:  precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre/li lithen delete the Windows partitions on your main disk with gpt:  precodegpt remove -i 4 /dev/disk0 gpt remove -i 3 /dev/disk0 /code/pre  If you get an error strong"gpt remove: unable to open device '/dev/disk0': Resource busy"/strong trying to remove a second (or third) partiton just repeat           precodediskutil umountDisk /dev/disk2 diskutil umountDisk /dev/disk0 /code/pre  After deleting or adding a partition with gpt the system sometimes|often|always tries to immediately mount all remaining partitions.

Please check this with diskutil list. Your main disk and the CoreStorage volume might have different DiskIdentifiers now." Therefore, I kindly ask you to check my diskutil list whether it is exactly as you imagined. http://fs1.directupload.net/images/150908/9vcpgxkt.jpg <comment247029> This is what "df" says. I assume disk 13 is not mounted. Any suggestions? http://fs2.directupload.net/images/150908/4sdixemx.jpg <comment247047> Thank you so far.
