Unable to open Keychain Access on Mac <body> When I try to open Keychain Access using Spotlight or Finder, I see an error saying: The Application "Keychain Access" is not open anymore. When I try to launch using open -a, I get:  precode$ open -a Keychain\ Access.app/ Unable to find application named 'Keychain Access.app/' /code/pre  It was working fine until yesterday. A restart did not seem to help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kDFsR.png" alt="Screenshot of image showing the Finder error message"  strongUpdate/strong:  It looks like I shouldn't rely on Terminal's autocomplete while using open. Removing the trailing slash did not fix it. The new error is:   precode$ open -a Keychain\ Access.app LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app with error -600. /code/pre  strongUpdate 2/strong:  Somehow it got fixed on its own. Among the things I tried was a restart, opening the app via the Terminal, and removing the plist from ~/Library/Preferences. None of those seemed to have had an immediate effect, if any at all, but Keychain Access is finally opening for me.  <answer257327> Lose the /.  precode$ open -a Keychain\ Access.app /code/pre  works for me. Or even:     $ open -a Keychain\ Access   <answer257329> Note: no "/" at the end - works perfectly fine for me too.    precode$ open -a Keychain\ Access /code/pre  Terminal must have been reading it as part of the fine name or something similar.  <answer257646> Copy codecom.apple.keychainaccess.plist/code from here: code/Users/YourName/Library/Preferences/code to some safe place and then delete it from the original location. Then try to launch Keychain Access again.  <comment321820> error -600 means **no eligible process with specified descriptor** maybe keychain app is corrupt? Have you an earlier version (from backup for example?) <comment321838> Already tried that. Did not help. :( <comment321839> Unfortunately, Time Machine was not enabled on my machine. <comment321848> I think the problem isn't your keychain itself but corrupt files. Try to boot into Internet Recovery **CMD + Option + R**  open disk utility and try to repair your drive. If doesn't work you need to reinstall maOS. Download from App Store and install - update current system does not affect of your personally data.
