Macbook not displaying wifi list <body> I've sent my MacBook Air to be repaired. When I got it back I switched it on and then realized that it's not displaying the Wi-Fi list. It's not recognizing any of my Wi-Fi access points with BT and it's not even recognizing BT-Wi-Fi. So I need a solution.  <comment326441> Can you clarify your question? Do you mean you see no WiFi networks listed in your WiFi menu, even though WiFi is switched on? Also, what version of macOS are you running?
