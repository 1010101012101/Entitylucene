iPhone backup: extracting app vs copy? <body> I'm trying to do a forensic analysis of an iPhone, saving a backup which is as raw as possible.   Using iMazing, I can backup apps using &lt;Copy to Mac:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Hr4f.png" alt="enter image description here"  .or &lt;Manage Apps: Extract App:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T3SWV.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWhich is the one which gives a backup that is as raw as possible?/strong  Indeed, why would they even produce different IPA files?   (&lt;Extract App produces a IPA file that contains an extra &lt;Payload folder, &lt;iTunesArtwork, and &lt;iTunesMetadata.plist.)  <answer296015> In iMazing there is multiple ways to browse backups or app data.  Here is the few possibilities:  ol liBrowse a specific app's backup content/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QD25X.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="2" liBrowse all backup's files and folders/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VE4Ml.png" alt="enter image description here"  ol start="3" liUse the function "Export Raw Data" (right click the device from the sidebar and click "Export Raw Data")/li /ol  <comment373782> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this question should be posed to [iMazing support](https://support.imazing.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). <comment373818> @IconDaemon, I'm seeing this issue with other iPhone backup tools too. Question is: What's the proper way to do a iPhone forensic backup? Saving the first kind of IPA or the second?
