How to deal with discounts in auto-renewable subscriptions in iTunes Connect? <body> I'm seeking a solution to such a problem with auto-renewable subscription: user can buy a feature for let say 100$. Now I want to introduce from time to time some discount, so I want get this situation:  ol liold user is paying all the time old 100$ for this feature/li liif you lucky to buy feature only(!) during discount period, you get first month at lower 10$ price, then it goes back to old 100$./li /ol  I see two problems, correct me if I'm wrong:  ol lidecreasing price of auto-renewable subscription does not notify user and extend his subscription - which means I have 90$ less for all old users that got renewal during discount period (unless I create another subscription in iTunes Connect which produces another problem)/li lido I have to create on every discount opportunity a new subscription with first month for 10$ and rest for 100$?/li /ol  Is this something that can be accomplished under the fall 2013 rules for iTunes connect?
