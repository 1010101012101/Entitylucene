Can I set a slideshow background on ios? <body> I know that on a Windows pc I can set my desktop background to be a slideshow of images that changes periodically. Is this possible on an iPhone in any way? If so, how can I do it?  Thanks!  <answer244851> Short answer, no. iOS 9 built-in feature set doesn't support a background slideshow.  There might be a third party app in the AppStore.  <comment301809> Any idea on what such an app might be? <comment301833> There's several apps in the Cydia app store if you're open to jailbreaking. I don't think there's anything good in the Apple store.
