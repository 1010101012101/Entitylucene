Time Machine to NAS connection issues <body> I have set up a NAS to host Time Machine backups for several users on the network using a sparsebundle.  Everything works great the first time around, however upon subsequent connections, I am getting some weird behavior.    If I use a different connection mechanism the second time around (Ethernet vs. wifi or VPN vs. wifi) I cannot connect to the resource.  I will get either a "resource temporarily unavailable" or "No mountable file systems" error.    I have confirmed that I can connect to the network share via these alternate connection mechanisms, but can't connect to the sparsebundle on that share.  If I switch to the 'original' connection method that was used to set up the sparsebundle, I can connect to it just fine.    strongIs there some sort of setting that prevents connection to the sparsebundle other than the original method?/strong    I am on the same LAN using either a wifi or an Ethernet connection or I am coming in through a Cisco VPN client.  Any help you can provide would be most helpful.
