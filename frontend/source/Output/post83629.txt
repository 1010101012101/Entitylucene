Any idea how to remove it?  <answer86236> It took me a while to narrow down the file that contains the list of apps shown in that system pref pane, but I finally found.  The list of apps is stored in code/var/db/locationd/clients.plist/code. Once I found that juicy bit of info a quick Google search revealed this related posting on superuser.com: Remove Applications from Location Services in Security &amp; Privacy on Mac OS X 10.8. That post is more of an answer than a question. It contains detailed step-by-step instructions on how to remove the no longer installed app from the list.  <comment96276> When you click on Location Services in the Privacy tab does the program show up in the list? Is the lock icon in the lower left corner of the window unlocked, allowing you to make changes? <comment96407> The program does show in the list, it is not removable however, locked or unlocked. <comment99342> No solution? What a shame : ( <comment99401> Could you add a screenshot of Location Services in System Preferences  Security & Privacy  Privacy? <comment99475> just added, thanks! <comment99562> well done, thank you!
