Turn off USB power on OS X/Mac Mini <body> I have a need to turn USB power off (and on) using a script or a piece of software. Ideally it should be possible to turn each port off/on separately, but also turning power off/on from all ports at once is sufficient. The machine I am using is Mac Mini. Anyone has a solution for this?  By USB power I mean Vbus, the 5V/500mA connection. I understand that the data connection is also turned down and it is fine, but it is not enough for me that the data connection is down and Vbus remains powered. This need comes from the need to keep mobile phones constantly connected for automatic testing. Some device/battery combinations do not like to be constantly connected and batteries start swelling in less than a year.  I recognize that multiple variations of this question are around. So far no solution that I could use. I'll list here my findings so far:  ul liit is possible to accomplish this by using external self powered USB HUB and controlling it's power. However, this is not an option for me (even quality hubs have caused other problems in my use)./li liit is possible to disable USB by removing .kext files. Among other sources it is explained in OS X Security configuration document. However this requires reboot and I am not sure if it really disables USB power or just data./li lithere are many claims that it just is not possible. However, OS X itself does it when it detects a device that consumes too much power, so there is at least hardware support. This error message is copied from /System/Library/Extension/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/Resources/English.lproj/Localizable.strings: "Unplug the device using too much power to re-enable USB devices." (of course I don't know if the disabling is done by turning off USB power, but I would assume it is natural action for the device that consumes too much of it). /li liit seems that on macbook the USB ports are normally powered even when the laptop is sleeping. While this is not solving my issue, it is kind of related./li /ul  <comment289527> Do you want to disable the whole port or just the power coming from the port.  Your title is confusing. <comment289529> It is enough for me to disable the power. Due to the nature of USB it effectively disables the port. But it is not enough for me to disable the data flow/driver loading and keep the Vbus powered. <comment289530> I have a phone connected to each port and I don't want to continuously charge those phones but only when I am communicating with them over USB. <comment289533> It can't happen.  USB specification calls for 5volts to be supplied.  If you turn that off, the USB will no longer work.  As far as charging, once your device reaches 100% it's smart enough to disconnect itself from the charging circuit. <comment289534> It can happen. As I explain as part of my question, OS X does it when it detects a device that consumes too much current. Only, I don't know if there is any way to trigger that other than by inserting a device that consume too much power. -- I wish you were right about the phone being smart enough. Unfortunately I have now four different devices with a swollen battery, after being plugged in for a year. There is plenty of discussion on that on the Internet, so I won't go into details. <comment289535> And it is fine for me that USB no longer works. That is why I need a way to turn in on also. <comment289536> You mis-understand.  You cannot turn off just the power it's the whole port or nothing. <comment289537> I think you misunderstand. It is ok for me to have "whole port" down. Or even the whole root hub and all USB ports in a mac mini. The only requirement I have is that the Vbus does not feed any power to the physically connected device and that I can turn the USB port/ports back up later.
