'localhost' stoped working as an alias for '127.0.0.1' for SSHing into my VirtualBox VM. Why, and how to fix? <body> The question explains the problem. For months I've never had any problems along these lines. Then, yesterday morning, I couldn't get into my VM! Took a long time to troubleshoot but here was the solution:  precodeBrendans-Mac-mini:~ Brendan$ ssh -p 3022 user@localhost ssh: Could not resolve hostname localhost: nodename nor servname provided, or not known Brendans-Mac-mini:~ Brendan$ ssh -p 3022 user@127.0.0.1 user@127.0.0.1's password:  Last login: Tue Jul  1 22:37:59 2014 from 10.0.2.2 /code/pre  So, why would this have happened, and more importantly, how do I fix it?  I tried codedig localhost/code, which seems to tell me that there's still some kind of connection between localhost and 127.0.0.1:  precodeBrendans-Mac-mini:~ Brendan$ dig localhost  ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.3-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; localhost ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 28989 ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0  ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;localhost.

Here's the normal contents of /etc/hosts in OS X (as of Mavericks):  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0     localhost /code/pre  Note that if you need to edit/recreate this file, it must be in plain text format (no formatting at all), with unix-style line endings (linefeeds). You can use a command line editor like codevi/code or codenano/code; if you want a GUI editor, I tend to recommend TextWrangler or its big brother BBEdit for editing files like this, since they're good about not adding spurious "helpful" things to the files you edit, and also can use admin rights to edit system files (like /etc/hosts).  (Also, it's not really visible or important, but those are tab characters between the addresses and names.)  For testing lookups like this, use codedscacheutil/code (codedscacheutil -q host -a name localhost/code) instead of something like codedig/code. The reason to use codedscacheutil/code is that codedig/code (and codehost/code and codensloogup/code) bypasses the system lookup policy and just checks DNS directly, while codedscacheutil/code uses the full system lookup policy. As a result, codedig/code won't see entries in /etc/hosts, or do mDNS (Bonjour) lookups, or look for Computer entries in directory services, or see cached entries from previous lookups, or...  When you have the hosts file set up properly, here's what codedscacheutil/code's output should look like:  precode$ dscacheutil -q host -a name localhost name: localhost ipv6_address: ::1 ipv6_address: fe80:1::1  name: localhost ip_address: 127.0.0.1 /code/pre  <comment163313> [Asked and answered over at Super User](http://superuser.com/q/777949/118944). Voting to close here unless a mod thinks that there's a better way to handle this. <comment163339> See my flag - best to answer it here too IMO.
