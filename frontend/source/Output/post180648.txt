iOS: Pressing Update opens the app <body> iPhone 4.  When I'm in the app store, and I want to update an app, I go to the updates tab and I click update. It proceeds to open the app without updating it.  I have tried hard shutdown, soft shutdown, and deleting the app.  Any help?  <comment214612> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/177500/apps-stuck-in-pending-update-status <comment214863> your comment in that question is what i have done already (hard shutdown). I may call it differently from what you call it. @tubedogg
