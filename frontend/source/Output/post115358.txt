Can the volume of an iPhone/iPad be changed remotely? <body> Both devices are running ios 7 at this point. I have Openssh installed on one of them, and can log in remotely (though there isn't anything interesting in /bin or /sbin).  I've also attempted to install Veency, but it just seems to crash and the last few attempts I can't even see that it's running the server (the iMac tells me to make sure screen-sharing is turned on).
