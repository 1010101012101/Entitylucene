I need to use the USB port AND have the iPad connected to a power source.  Possible?  <answer55971> Not with Apple's own kit, but you can find various adapters on places like ebay which do what you want. My friend has one similar to this which appears to work fine (on iOS 5.1.1 at least).  <comment64269> Wow, that is perfect! Thanks so much.
