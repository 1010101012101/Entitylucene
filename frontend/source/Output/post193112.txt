Please restore the device to a version of the OS listed below <body> I'm getting the following message when tethering one of my iPads used for testing. Its telling me to em"Please restore the device to a version of the OS listed below..."/em, but it does not provide the list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRft8.png" alt="enter image description here"  The image above was cropped to help with presentation, but not text was removed from the image.  What is the list of OSes that Apple recommends I downgrade to? They seems to have forgotten to provide the list.  Related, how does Apple recommend I do it? As far as I know, effectively downgrades can't be performed.  hr  Oddly, iTunes can work with the everything just fine (my OS X version and iOS version). So it seems Apple is more than happy to accommodate the non-latest OS X and iOS when it comes to selling me stuff...  <answer193115> The latest version is iOS 8.3. It would seem it's time to upgrade.
