logger vs syslog -s <body> What exactly is the difference between using codelogger/code and codesyslog -s/code? According to its manpage, codelogger/code provides interface to the system log module, but I can't really see the point given that codesyslog(1)/code seems to be just that, only much more powerful.  Is it just a matter of simplicity or am I missing something? And which one would you recommend for simple scripting?  <answer64897> codesyslog/code is more powerful than codelogger/code which also means that codelogger/code is easier to use for simple purposes. The man page indicates as much:     man logger - Logger provides a strongshell command interface/strong to the syslog(3) system log module   The main advantage of codesyslog -s/code for simple logging is sending log lines to a different computer to have it logged there. For simple shell scripting that's probably not needed.  <comment76345> Thanks for the clarification! Seems like it's more or less what I expected. However, as you can notice, the manpage you're citing mentions `syslog(3)` (the system log module), rather than `syslog(1)` (the command). In fact, `syslog(1)` isn't referred to at all in the whole `logger` manpage, even though it seems to provide "a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log module" just as well. I found it a bit confusing and hence my question! <comment76346> (1) and (3) are chapter numbers in the man pages. 1 is commands, 3 is library calls. The facility itself is just syslog.
