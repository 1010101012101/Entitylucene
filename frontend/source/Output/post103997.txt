iPhone4 can't access iCloud after upgrade to iOS 7.0.2 <body> Software upgrade seems to have worked fine but settings-icloud is disabled.  It used to work fine.  Also FaceTime icon produces  message "Account restriction - this iphone is restricted from creating FaceTime accounts".  Any ideas please? Thanks in advance.  <answer104006> strongSettings  Restrictions  Allow Changes  Accounts/strong  If disallowed FaceTime appears as you said. I had the same problem and in looking for the solution managed to figure it out.  <comment133387> Why stop at 7.0.2? wWhy not go all the way to 7.0.4 to make sure that you are current? Otherwise killswitch has the right idea
