iPad photo editing app that exports edits as XMP to reuse in lightroom? <body> Basically, I'm looking for Lightroom for iPad :) but until then, I'm trying to find an alternative.    To organize and tag pictures I'll be using Photosmith which integrates with Lightroom.   Now, I need an app to do basic editing of pictures (cropping, exposure, saturation). But I need an app will do this in a non-destructive way and that will make the edits available as XMP so that later, I can just copy the XMP as sidecar files and load them in Lightroom (or better, it could load them via a lightroom plug-in the same way Photosmith works).  PS: I posted the same question on photo.stackexchange.com, see here.  <answer45876> Have you tried Adobe Revel?  Basically you can edit photos on your iPad, store them on your computer and the edit them there as well.  It's a subscription service with many of the features of Lightroom.  <comment52338> Thanks for the recommendation. However, it seems like Revel is more of an alternative to Lightroom then a way to extend it on a mobile device. Integration with my actual Lightroom library is required. Also, Revel does not support RAW files and there's no software for Windows.
