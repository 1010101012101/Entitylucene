iTunes: "Your account was changed while you were editing your account information." <body> I logged into the iTunes store via Settings on a new iPhone 5s, and it automatically went to the "confirm your payment information" page.  I confirmed my method of payment (none), and it came back with an error, letting me know that:     Your account was changed while you were editing your account info. We were unable to save the changes. Please try again later.   I was currently logged into the Manage my Apple ID page when this error occurred (but was not actively editing anything), and once I logged out, I was able to confirm my payment method with no issue.  I was also able to log into the iTunes store on my Macbook and confirm the payment information with zero issue, but as far as I remember I was not logged in into the manage my Apple ID page.  Has anyone experienced this before? Does being logged into the manage my Apple ID page seem like a likely culprit for the error message I received?  <answer217396> I could see a race condition causing this briefly, but if you get this error for more than 15 minute, I would get in queue with Apple support:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/support/ios/contact//li lihttp://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus /li /ul  Unless there is an outage, you'll likely need someone to assist on the sever side to resolve this error.
