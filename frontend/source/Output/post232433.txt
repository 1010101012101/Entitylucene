Where are Google Chrome cookies stored on a Mac? <body> Where are Google Chrome cookies located on a mac?  I went code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies/code, but I don't think that this file is the one. I cleared cookies, went to this file, copied content, brows a little, paste the content i copied back into the file and saved. I was still logged in gmail.  <answer232437> Session cookies are only stored in memory, but the rest are in code~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies/code, it's an sqlite3 database.  <comment284039> I deleted the content of file. I am still logged in to http://apple.stackexchange.com/. Looks like sessions cookies is what I need. Perhaps a better question is, how does google chrome delete cookies eg where are session cookies stored? <comment284047> "Session cookies are only stored in memory" - If Chrome works the same as on Windows then if it's configured to "continue where you left off" (ie. remember tabs from last time), then Chrome also "remembers" session cookies. <comment284069> Okay. Perhaps a better question is, what do you delete when you go to history-delete cookies. <comment334991> has this changed? cannot find this location anymore.
