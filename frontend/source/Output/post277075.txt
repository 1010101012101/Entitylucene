How do I put Apple Hardware Test on my a flash drive or DVD in a way that can be selected as the Startup Disk in SysPrefs? <body> my old Mac Mini (3,1 Early 2009) running 10.11.6 seems to have hardware issues but it won't run Apple Hardware Test. If I load the OE Install Disk #2 which has AHT on it and press D at startup, it goes to gray screen forever (no logo, no nothing). If I hit Option at boot to select that disk, it also goes to a gray screen forever. I am using a wired Mac keyboard. Previously, I have put AHT on a flash drive and tried to boot using Option, but that fails and goes to the gray screen. (Covered here: Can&#39;t boot Apple Hardware Test with correct install disk that has AHT)  I have erased and reinstalled the OS, updated the firmware on my internal SSD drive, run First Aid, repaired permissions from Terminal, did a PRAM/SMC reset (PRAM reset caused major damage, necessitated recovery/OS reinstall), replaced the PRAM battery, replaced the RAM, booted into Safe Mode. Didn't help. A month or so ago, AHT from DVD worked fine. My old Mac Mini can't do AHT over the internet like later models.  However, to update the internal SSD firmware I had to put the ISO file on a DVD, which, when loaded, was selectable in SysPrefs  Startup Disk. I successfully booted to that DVD and ran the firmware updater after choosing it there and restarting. How do I create AHT on a flash drive that will be similarly selectable in SysPrefs  StartUp Disk?   [By the way, I am currently working on replacing this Mac Mini.]  Thanks for any help.
