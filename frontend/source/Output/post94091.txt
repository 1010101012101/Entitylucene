Speed Up Podcasts on iPod Classic <body> I'm looking for a way to listen to podcasts at 2x on my iPod classic. I know this is not supported out of the box.   Is there an alternative firmware like rockbox, that supports syncing with iTunes and double playback speed or - which I assume is likelier - a Mac app that allows me to easily speed up the mp3 files. With easily I mean it should support editing in batch and replacing the files automatically, ideally started with a script directly in iTunes.  (I do know about audacity, but I want something a little more automated)  <answer121711> There's no such way to do that, actually. So, you have two possibilities:  ol liAdjust the tempo before add the podcast on your phone (using Audacity or something similar), you can have a look on this Super User post to understand how to do it./li liConvert the podcast into an audiobook format. You can adjust the actual velocity of your audiobook going into "Settings  Audiobooks"/li /ol  Besides that, I can't see no other way to do that, sorry.  <answer122423> Set the media Kind to Audiobook in iTunes and re-sync.
