How to disable Keychain? <body> I have a very disturbing issue on my mac. After I log in my mac keep asking me for an Apple Keychain password, for several times every few mins.  Is there any way to disable those pop ups or more likely to disable Keychain entirely?  Thank you everyone,  yours, emRoei/em.    <comment353776> Thanks you so much! how could i missed it.. <comment353778> Your welcome. - All the best.
