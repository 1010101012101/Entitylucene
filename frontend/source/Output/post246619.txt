Move all app windows to another work space in El Capitan <body> On my home machine (which is still on Mavericks) I can load mission control and move multiple windows from a single app by dragging the app icon (instead of the individual windows) to another work space.   This icon is not available in El Capitan, is there another way I can do this or at least a work around for it?  <answer246657> There's a workaround, though not as efficient as your previous method...  Right click the App's icon in the Dock, select Options  All Desktops.br Switch to your preferred Space. [I use the kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd [number] /kbd method.]br From the Dock again, turn the Option back to None.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Broq0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252625> Enable “Group windows by application” in Mission Control preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zsXdc.png" alt="System Preferences pane"  That will bring back the app icon in Mission Control, which would allow you to drag all windows of a given app between spaces:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9XyWl.jpg" alt="App icon in Mission Control"
