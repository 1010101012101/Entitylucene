Pausing screen recording in old Quicktime 10.0 (131) <body> Running Snow Leopard 10.6.8 on an "Early 2009 iMac", I seek a screen-recorder able pause/unpause during recording.  Post  How do I install QuickTime 10.1 on Snow Leopard?  says Snow Leopard comes with Quicktime X, yet my Quicktime-About lists "10.0 (131)", and Update says this is current for OSX 10.6.8.  Both  Pause screen recording in QuickTime X  and   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=389hhtOXIOc  say how to pause in "Quicktime X", but the method appears to fail on my Quicktime 10.0. [I'll provide failure details if needed.]  What is the relation between 'Quicktime X", "Quicktime 10.x" and "Quicktime 10.0", and do I actually have Quicktime X on my machine?  Or, is there some free pausible screen-recorder I can use on 10.6.8 ?  <comment162827> please do provide the information how it fails. <comment162828> so you have a OS X! it is also called snow-leopard, or 10.6.8. I also have a OS X, it is also called Mavericks, or 10.9.4. Same applies to Quicktime.
