Offline download of Enhanced Dictation in Mavericks <body> I want to use the amazing Enhanced Dictation Feature available in OSX Mavericks, like the screenshot says is required a download of 785 MB.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7t0QE.png" alt="dictation-screenshot"  The only problem is that in my home where i have my Mac i haven't internet connection so i need a way to download some kind of pkg or dmg to use at home when i have my offline Mac.  Is there any way to do that, links are appreciated if exists.  <answer110848> No, there is not a way to do this yet. I hope Apple corrects this soon.  Update: It is now working. Clear the cache of the files on mac of the speech if already present. Then, take McDonald's WiFi or something, and Valaha (spelling).  <answer131106> I had the same problem and i figure out how to solve it  I wanted to keep the file so I don't have to re-download every time  here is the way tested on mavericks 10.9.3 and it works  download the file 785 mb  when it finished go to  SYSTEM -- LIBRARY --SPEECH Recognizers  SpeechRecognitionCoreLanguages this is the folder   hit get info and look at the size simply copy and paste that folder and save it , if you need to install in another computer copy and paste the folder to that location , if you ever reinstall the system you don't need to re-download because you already have it  here is the link for the pkg i haven't try this pkg yet i just got you the link  http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/55/13/031-1940/chpuvr2ntbhisy2em872b4j6hsk71croja/SpeechRecognitionCoreLanguage_en_US.pkg
