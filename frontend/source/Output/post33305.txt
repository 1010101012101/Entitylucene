How can I find the size of multiple folders? <body> When I highlight several folders in Finder and do a get info, I get an info window for each folder.  Is there a way to get a single window showing size of all folders highlighted?  <answer33306> Open a finder window and set the view to list view. Press command-J and select "calculate all sizes" then click "use as standard".  Now folder sizes will show in your finder. I don't think it is possible to show sizes for multiple folders, but this might be a good workaround.  <answer33308> Alternatively  ul liopen Terminal.app/li licodecd/code to the directory 'above' the ones you need the size for/li licodedu -sm FOLDER1 FOLDER2/code gives sizes in megabytes/li licodedu -sg FOLDER1 FOLDER2/code gives sizes in Gigabytes /li /ul  <answer33309> kbdcmd/kbd+kbdalt/option/kbd+kbdi/kbd will give you info on multiple highlighed items.  <answer33330> There are 3 forms of "Get Info":  1) Standard "codeGet Info/code" achieved through kbdCommand/kbd+kbdi/kbd which can potentially create multiple windows for each item selected.  2) "codeGet Summary Info/code" achieved through kbdCommand/kbd+kbdControl/kbd+kbdi/kbd which uses a single window to show combined info about the selection:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Na8D2.png" alt="enter image description here"   3) "codeInspector/code", like @iskra mentioned, achieved through kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdi/kbd, which is similar to code2)/code except that it updates the info dynamically based on your selection.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXHyN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment37996> cmd+alt+i and highlight what you need <comment37999> How is alt done since it is own the option key? <comment38000> alt and optn is the same key <comment274043> Or go into terminal, type `du -sm` and drag all the files you want to include in the calculation in there
