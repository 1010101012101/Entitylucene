Links don't open on some sites in Safari <body> When I am on www.nfl.com with Safari, none of the links do any actions or open a page. No javascript seems to be involved (JS is turned on anyway). The link destinations show up in the window footer, and I can right-click and copy the link, then paste it and it will open, but clicking on the link does nothing. I can also open the link if I right-click and say "Open in New Tab".  Here is an example of a link structure copied from the page source.  precode&lt;a href="/news/story/0ap1000000241366/article/joe-staley-shouldnt-have-been-penalized-nfl-says" data-tracking-id="League: Staley mistakenly penalized"&gt;League: Staley mistakenly penalized&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-tracking-pos="Article_1_4"&gt; /code/pre  EDIT: The exact same symptoms happen at http://www.adobe.com .  I can right-click to open in new tab, but links are not responsive.   Two things that might be related: I have an code/etc/hosts/code file which redirects ad sites to 127.0.0.1, but there is no entry for nfl.com or codedata-tracking/code. I also have the Safari pref "ask web sites not to track me" turned on, and block pop-up windows turned off. I turned off the "not tracking" pref and the page still didn't work.  I should also mention: I don't have any proxies configured, and I'm using Safari 6.0.5 on OSX 10.8.4. (I have the same problem with Chrome, but not with Firefox...)  Does anyone else have this problem, or an idea how to solve it?   <comment119361> Does it work in FF or IE or GC ? <comment119363> I should have mentioned that: It does work in FF... Interestingly, also works if I use the Develop menu to set Safari's user agent as FF or IE. (Conspiracy?) <comment119364> here is the example http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000241427/article/blaine-gabbert-out-for-jacksonville-jaguars-in-week-2  so it works with me, lets see why <comment119365> I tried Safari with Chrome and Safari with Safari, both work. <comment119367> I have Enabled JavaScript, and blocking pop ups, no plug ins enabled. <comment119371> Strange. I can click on the link directly as with your embedded one above, but nothing happens from their main page at nfl.com. I must have some other security setting that they don't like (it has been this way for a long time). Thanks for trying.
