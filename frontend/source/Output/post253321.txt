Install OS X/macOS on a Mac mini without a keyboard (10.11 El Capitan/10.12 Sierra) <body> How do you configure OS X/macOS on a (headless) Mac mini without a keyboard?  ul liThe Mac mini is connected via ethernet/li liA MacBook Pro is connected to the same network via ethernet/li liThe Mac mini is at the first screen of a new OS X 10.11 installation/li /ul  I want to login to the Mac mini using ARD (Apple Remote Desktop) but can't use the methods of 10.6 (serial number + IP address).  Thanks for any hints.  <comment315226> Why can't you access the Mac mini directly? It would be much easier to plug in a monitor and keyboard for setup, and then allow it to be controlled from a different computer (ARD) <comment315228> I can access the Mac mini, but I won't be able to connect it to a monitor. I'll be able to connect it to a MBP using Thunderbolt, if that's of any help. <comment315281> You generally can't ARD whilst the machine is in the startup phase [which I guess is really what an update is]. if you were already remoted to it before it rebooted & you keep the window open, it will auto-reconnect as soon as it can. I think this leaves you no option but to connect it physically, if you need to interact with it during setup. I can find no guide on remote OS installs, only remote software installs.
