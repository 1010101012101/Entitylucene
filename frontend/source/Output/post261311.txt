ssh hangs after authentication <body> I used to connect to a remote codeLinux/code server through codessh -v remote/code from my codeosx/code client. Now the connection hangs after authentication:  precodedebug1: Entering interactive session. debug1: client_input_global_request: rtype hostkeys-00@openssh.com want_reply 0  /code/pre  This is happening with both remote servers I have available. I can instead successfully do remote port forwarding (with a not-interacting session) codessh -fN remote/code. I have removed the code.bash*/code and code.cshrc/code and code.profile/code files on the remote servers.  I have checked that the ssh to my remote servers is working correctly on my codeLinux/code box that I run on codeosx/code within a virtual box.  I am using the following configuration for ~/.ssh/config  precodeServerAliveInterval 120  Host            * ForwardX11       yes  Host            remote HostName        remote.address.uk HostKeyAlias    remote.address.uk User            myusername LocalForward    localhost:5903 remote:5904 LocalForward    localhost:5902 remote:5901 TCPKeepAlive    yes IdentityFile    ~/.ssh/id_rsa /code/pre  <answer261391> The problem was that the x forwarding is broken on my codeosx/code. I have disabled it and now I can connect again
