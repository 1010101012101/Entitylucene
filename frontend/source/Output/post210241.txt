El Capitan’s full screen split view via CLI? <body> El Capitan introduced a new split screen mode. Is there a way to enter it via CLI?  I’m guessing that if there is a way to do this, it’ll be via AppleScript (to get codeactive window/code, and whatnot), but the language isn’t really important, as long as it can be done via CLI.  <comment253749> Why do you need to do it via CLI? <comment253751> Because it means I can script it with tools. Not sure what you want to know with that question, though, this isn’t an [XY problem](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem). I want to do it because I want to do that thing specifically, the “why” isn’t that relevant, in this case.
