CoreAudio, SandBox & Kernel Errors <body> My console is littered with coreaudio errors. Will trashing the listed components, solve the problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wvOsg.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  These are all of the logs that mention the word 'region':  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6TYRH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169141> It does not show the root cause. Something about changing the region? did you do that ? <comment169143> Huh, not that I recall...Where would I locate this 'shared region' to attempt to reset it?
