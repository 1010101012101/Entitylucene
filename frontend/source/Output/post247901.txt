Downloading app data & document to computer from ICloud <body> I am wondering if it is possible to download document &amp; data of a backup of a specific app from icloud to computer local.  <comment305902> A backup of what exactly? iOS backup? <comment305904> the backup of an app. means custom user data in the app. not ios backup. <comment305907> Of an app which is part of an iOS backup? Or of an OSX app which uses iCloud as a backup destination? <comment305909> Lets imagine a specific ios app allows a user to backup his data over icloud drive. I want to download that data file to my computer. <comment305919> The question had come up before (http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/182253/extract-specific-app-data-from-an-older-icloud-backup) but didn't get answered. AFAIK the iCloud backup of your iPhone isn't accessible from your computer.
