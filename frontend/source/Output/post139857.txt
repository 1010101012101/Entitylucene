Am I being monitored? <body> I have a few questions to ask regarding the parental controls.   I have a MacBook Pro OS X version 10.9.4. and it was bought by my ex to help me with my medical schooling. We’re no longer together. And I’ve caught him logging into my emails somehow recently. Don’t know if he hacked into it or just came across my password.  So, lately while bored I got curious about my computer and discovered Console and started to observe what was gong on and to my amazement, I had noticed many many things. i have disabled the bluetooth sharing and everything else because it seemed that my computer is being monitored. I’m just not sure. But what sticks out the most for me is the Parental controls remote issue. I have disabled everything. So I think.   precodeJul 24 09:09:03 (MYNAME)-mbp parentalcontrolsd[957]: StartObservingFSEvents [849:] -- *** StartObservingFSEvents started event stream  Jul 24 11:22:01 (MYNAME)-mbp com.apple.preference.universalaccess.remoteservice[1179]: Bogus event received by listener connection: &lt;error: 0x7fff737b0b50&gt; { count = 1, contents = "XPCErrorDescription" =&gt; &lt;string: 0x7fff737b0e60&gt; { length = 18, contents = "Connection invalid" } } Jul 24 11:22:23 (MYNAME)-mbp System Preferences[1173]: view service marshal for &lt;NSRemoteView: 0x7fbf8b634110&gt; failed to forget accessibility connection due to Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4099 "Couldn’t communicate with a helper application."

My ex has a Mac desktop at his house and at his business. I’m not sure if he’s the one monitoring my computer activities…or malware??.  But in all seriousness, I am very curious to what this means. I’m too old to be monitored….  Thank you.    <answer140138> First, I have the exact same messages in my log files. I also was worried, but parental controls is more of a mechanism to restrict usage of the system. In other words you would use parental controls to make the system less powerful, and as an admin you can easily turn them off.  You would go to   precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Parental Controls /code/pre  as an admin, and you will be able to assure yourself that it's only Apple.  It seems that with 10.9.4 it was activated for the Guest user (Managed Preferences). It's irritating, but bearable.   That being said, Remote Management or ARD emis/em the tool one would use in this situation to monitor a user. This requires access to the target computer. Since you've already had your email hacked, perhaps it's time to back up your personal data and take a couple of hours and wipe your system clean. Change passwords, create a new user, use your firewall, and change your iCloud info.  Reasonable precautions actually go far.   You'll probably want to start by strongremoving your name from the logfile you posted completely./strong   Good luck with everything.  <answer167985> Install Little Snitch. It's an Outbound Firewall meaning that when apps on your computer try to establish connections to other machines, you'll get a notification and be able to block the connections.  If someone is trying to monitor your computer, Little Snitch would inform you of the outgoing network connections and allow you to block them.  <comment165160> Your user name appears in the log; you might want to avoid that. I’ve proposed an edit so that it’s not readily accessible, but it will still be viewable in the history. If you’d like to change that, I would recommend discussing with an admin.
