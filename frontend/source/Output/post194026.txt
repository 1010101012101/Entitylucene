Programmatically check if "Share iTunes Library XML with other applications" is disabled <body> iTunes update (10.2.0.145) seems to have added new advanced feature "Share iTunes LIbrary XML with other applications" which if disabled no longers outputs the codeMusic Library.xml/code.   Our applications is highly depended on that file, which by this documentation states the file will be available. Anyone know how to set, or check if that preference is disabled? I have looked at the com.apple.iTunes.plist, but nothing there seemed to reflect that setting.  <answer244344> I have a solution for mac. mac solution "ShareiTunesLibrary.applescript"  precodeactivate application "iTunes" tell application "System Events"     tell process "iTunes"         keystroke "," using command down         repeat until exists toolbar 1 of window 1             delay 0.2         end repeat         tell window 1             if title does not contain "Advanced" then                 click button "Advanced" of toolbar 1             end if             repeat until its title starts with "Advanced"                 delay 0.2             end repeat             tell checkbox "Share iTunes Library XML with other applications" of group 1                 if value is not 1 then                     click it                 end if             end tell             click button "OK"         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  stuck in windows  <comment232698> I have the same problem. Seems, this setting is stored in database -- iTunes Library.itl file. But format of this binary file is undocumented. <comment232758> exactly, not only is it not documented it's also encrypted. I found this library that could be useful. But it no longer works: https://github.com/josephw/titl. For now, I'm just going to warn our users that they have to enable this in order for our app to work. <comment301123> If u have any information around mac ,please share <comment301152> Nice. I basically just end up checking if the xml file exists or not on windows. Not the best way, but did the trick. <comment301229> so how you  are able to get itunes data without its itunes media library.xml in windows. <comment301268> Unfortunately you can't. Currently, I display a warning to the user letting them know they must enable that feature if they want integration with iTunes. Not ideal, but it works.
