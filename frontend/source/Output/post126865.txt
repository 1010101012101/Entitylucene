What happens if I buy a paid game while it's free? <body> There's this game on the App Store called Flying Hamster HD, before it used to cost like $6 or something now it's free. My question is what happens if I do get it while it's free? When the price comes back do I have to pay for it? And what if I delete the game when it's free and decide to re-download it after it becomes paid?  <answer126866> When it's available for free and you embuy/em it you get it for strongfree/strong. It's impossible to charge you afterwards because when you decide to download it because it's free.  Many apps become free over time, and that's one of the ways how I save a lot of money.  So in short, strongfree = free/strong (watch out for in-app purchases though, they are never free!)  To give you a better detail about updating apps:  ul liIt's free if they update the same app, not if they decide to put a complete new application in the AppStore./li /ul  <comment148614> So that means if I get it for free it's free forever? And free on all devices that have my App Store account logged in? <comment148615> @Lexdexia - Yes.  I frequently jump on "free for a limited time" deals and haven't had any trouble re-downloading the app again on the same or different devices when it goes back up to $0.99 or whatnot. <comment148620> It's added to your purchases list even when it's free. You can download it a million times again (for free) if you  decide to  remove it. <comment148626> yep, in the Mac and iOS app stores the only way you would have to pay to upgrade is if they released an entirely new version (e.g. 1Password recently went from 3 to 4, I can still download 3, but I have to pay for 4 if I want to upgrade) <comment148627> By upgrade you mean the updated version of the same app or a new app? <comment148635> Please see the edit in the answer. <comment148660> You may think of purchasing apps as adding a license to use them to your account; when an app is presented gratis, you get the license gratis.
