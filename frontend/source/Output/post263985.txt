Can easycap viewer work on macOS? <body> I have recently bought an EasyCAP DC60. I have also downloaded easy cap viewer Fushicai on my MacBook Air which is currently running macOS Sierra. I'm trying to display my PS3 on my laptop using a HDMI to AV converter because I don't have an AV cable for my PS3. When I start up the easy cap viewer, it just shows a black screen.   How do I fix this?  <answer263994> The problem you have is that EasyCapViewer 0.6.2 isn't supported on versions of macOS above Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10). In other words, it will work with versions of the Mac OS from OS X Leopard (specifically 10.5.8) up to Yosemite, but won't work on El Capitan or Sierra.  According to the developer:     2015-10-31: Reports indicate EasyCapViewer doesn't work on OS X El   Capitan. This would be a good time for other developers to pitch in. I   will spend some time investigating too but no guarantees.   Source: https://bentrask.com/easycap/  Unfortunately there has not been an update since from the Developer.  In the absence of other macOS alternatives, you may have some joy from using a Windows installation via Bootcamp or via software such as VirtualBox, Parallels, or VMware Fusion.  <comment330794> Can you share links to the actual _Fushicai_ viewer you downloaded and the HDMI to AV converter you're using? <comment330796> Yes, the download link is https://bentrask.com/easycap/EasyCapViewer-fushicai.zip and the converter I'm using is called "Mini HDMI2AV".
