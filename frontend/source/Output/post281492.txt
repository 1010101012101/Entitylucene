Issues with CoreUtils Greadlink <body> Recently I installed CoreUtils with HomeBrew for my terminal on macos. However, when I use the greadlink command, I am unable to get the proper file path. What I mean to say is that every time I do the following:   precodeMy-MBP: insertnamehere$ greadlink -f something.apk  /code/pre  I get:  precode/Users/insertnamehere/projects/something.apk /code/pre  When its actually located at:  precode/Users/insertnamehere/Documents/something.apk /code/pre  The same happens for any directory. Basically, it will list the file that I'm trying to find under that directory.   This is happening on a MacBook Pro 13 inch, with both iTerm and the normal Terminal.
