Remove shift key augmentation for Mission Control animation <body> I recently upgraded to Mountain Lion and all of a sudden my key bindings for Sublime Text 2 multi-selection editing are no longer working. Specifically, I had key bindings set up for kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdUp/Down arrow/kbd.  Now Mission Control has taken over that key binding. How can I remove the Shift key augmentation (that causes the transition to be slower) for the shortcut?  <answer66440> You can disable the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdUp/kbd/kbdDown/kbd shortcuts for Mission Control in the Keyboard preference pane. Just untick both "Mission Control" and "Application windows". This will also prevent the kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdUp/kbd/kbdDown/kbd key bindings, where the kbdShift/kbd key acts as a modifier to slow down the animation, as you have noticed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNFao.png" alt="screenshot of Keyboard settings"  Disabling these shortcuts will allow you to use it again in Sublime Text 2 or other applications.  <answer115698> You can disable the keyboard shortcuts for slow-motion effects by following these instructions:  ol liOpen Terminal./li liOpen the codeplist/code file in your user's library preferences folder that contains the setting by typing codeopen ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist/code and hit kbdreturn/kbd./li liA window similar to this will open in Xcode:/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tez64.png" alt="XCode PList Editor"  ol start="5" liFor items code34/code, code35/code, and code37/code, set codeenabled/code to codeNO/code./li liClose the file, click codeSave/code if prompted, and restart your system./li liEnjoy./li /ol  Note: code34/code and code35/code may not be present in the plist if you have never opened the Mission Control preferences pane and changed the "Mission Control" or "Application windows" settings. If code37/code isn't present either, simply add it yourself.  This process has been tested with:  ul liOS X Yosemite/li liOS X El Capitan/li limacOS Sierra/li /ul  h2Source/h2  ol liMacWorld/li liIn Translation/li /ol  <answer116716> I am using Mavericks and opened the file in TextWrangler. Do not be shocked, it's in XML format.  Find the items 34,35 and 37 (check out Behrang's post) and change the appropriate tag to codefalse/code (this is the same as changing codeenabled/code to codeNO/code ).  Like so  precode&lt;key&gt;37&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;enabled&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;false/&gt; /code/pre  Now you can happily use the key combination emwith/em kbdShift/kbd and rearrange your bullets and paragraphs without starting the slow expose animation.  <comment78155> Yeah but I actually like having the Ctrl + Up/Down arrow shortcuts.  I JUST want to disable the Shift key portion of the key combination. <comment78156> @LesterPeabody I'm afraid you cannot only disable the shift portion of these keybindings. <comment78163> I see.  Well, that's just totally awesome. <comment136537> Have some rep :)  Thanks for the follow up. <comment141579> Odd. I only have 18 entries in that and keys 34, 35 and 37 are not among them. <comment247087> +1 for suggesting TextWrangler, thanks! <comment255255> Awesome! Works on Yosemite too :) <comment293901> I had to be explicit about opening in xcode: `open -a "Xcode" ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist` <comment330432> Just logging off works too (no need to do full reboot if you don't want to) <comment349658> Thanks very much. I didn't want to install xCode just to edit a single plist.
