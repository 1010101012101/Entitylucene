Why would Preview save just my annotations? <body> I was using Preview to annotate a screenshot for a question on Apple.StackExchange.com and I saved it. For some reason, it only saved my annotation.

It's not that... <comment14347> Do you recall this time what happened? <comment14360> I annotated a screenshot and then I tried to save it.

I think it's happened when I did a combination of crop and annotate, but I don't think it was consistent. <comment24960> What version of Mac OS X are you using, and what version of Preview? <comment30287> I was using Snow Leopard at the time. I'm on Lion now, no repro, so...
