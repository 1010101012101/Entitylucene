Delete iCloud bookmark only from a specific computer <body> I have iCloud Safari bookmark syncing set up on two Macs and an iPhone. Is it possible to delete a bookmark (or set of bookmarks) from one machine only, so that they continue to exist on the other two devices?  <answer96935> As any changes performed to an emiCloud-Sync service/em will  be pushed to all other iCloud-Sync devices, your only option would be to emunsync/em the desired device form iCloud's Safari and then delete the bookmarks.   Bear in mind that once you re-enable the Safari's Sync, all of its data will be merged together.   <answer97041> Cleaning iCloud Bookmarks Procedure:  Turn off bookmark syncing on all devices and on computer.  Clean /file /sort Safari bookmarks. Quit Safari.   Locate bookmarks.plist Safari folder in ~/Library. Drag to the desktop.   Start Safari. Bookmarks should be blank.   Turn Safari bookmarks sync back on. Let it sync to iCloud.   Quit Safari, move the ,plist back ~/Library/Safari.  Start Safari. Edited bookmark .plist is back in place. Let it sync to iCloud.  <comment113760> That's actually not a bad solution; I don't make changes to my bookmarks very often. If I did need to sync them again in the future, I could just re-delete the group again. Thanks!
