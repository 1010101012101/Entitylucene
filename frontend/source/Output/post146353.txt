Dictionaries on iOS 8 not working <body> I just updated from iOS 7 to iOS 8, and I noticed that the built-in dictionaries, I previously used, aren't working. I had used American English, British English, and Apple Dictionary. Now, when I try to define any word, I get a "No definition found" error. The dictionaries I previously used show a blue circle (while all the others show the cloud download icon).  I tried to download a new dictionary, and I was able to use it. However, that was in another language.  How can I enable these dictionaries again?  <answer146377> You can re-enable the apple dictionary by following this steps:  ol liTap on the word you want to define to select it and activate the popup./li liTap on Define to call up the dictionary./li liTap on Manage./li liNow activate/download the Apple Dictionary or any other dictionaries you want./li liTap the X button beside any extra dictionaries you want to remove./li /ol  Now you should have your dictionary enabled again.  <answer147290> After updating to 8.0.2, the bug has been fixed! :)  <comment172498> The previous dictionaries show blue circlesï¼Œand you can not manage it. <comment172516> Try the fix in the last posting at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6392686 <comment172626> Unfortunately that didn't resolve the problem. <comment172749> Deleting language doesn't resolve the problem <comment173679> Don't forget to accept your answer (so your question comes off the unanswered list). <comment173899> It this also in Apple's update description? <comment175504> The circles are download progress indicators. Looks like iOS needs to re-download them after the update, and the somehow the download is stuck at 0% <comment175506> I Have the same problem on two different devices running 8.0.2. (Upgraded directly from 7 to 8.0.2) <comment183280> I have he exact problem on an iPad, it first appeared in iOS 8, then with every update up till 8.1, the problem still exists. <comment184210> This appears to be an issue with updating rather than the content of the update, so I don't believe this is a proper answer. <comment262477> In iOS 9, to delete a dictionary left swipe its entry in the list (there is no X button anymore).
