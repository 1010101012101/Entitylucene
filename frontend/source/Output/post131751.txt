Remember Window Dimension / Position Single Screen Laptop <body> Is there any way to have windows remember where they were and how big they were on OSX?  I've tried the suggestions in this discussion but it's still not working.  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5471042?tstart=30  <answer131754> I would suggest using a tool like Divvy to position and remember window positions. OS X simply doesn't handle it in an ideal manner.  <comment154811> Hmm ... more apps to do what the OS should be doing.  Coming from the windows world I'm constantly surprised by things like this.  Thanks Dave. <comment154812> Do not see where it remembers windows? <comment154818> OS X should remember window positions—it always does for me… what app/situation doesn't it work for? <comment154826> Windows switch size and or position for me when I adjust the resolution of my monitor or if I (un)plug an external monitor. Are you doing either of these? <comment154827> yeah, Divvy can help you manage windows, but doesn't seem to have a way to remember window positions. <comment154828> Hmm ... I'm less impressed with OSX by the day. <comment154829> For instance, open Terminal, stick it somewhere on the desktop, stretch it out for the long commands I use, close it ... open it again sometime later ... repeat move and stretch ... basic window management imho ... <comment154830> I do exactly that with Terminal i.e move and stretch it. It always remembers. Must application windows in OS X have a `Auto save`  in their framework. This is used to save the position and bounds ( frame rectangle ) of the windows in the preference file of the app. Terminal and finder both use this. <comment154832> This is really odd, neither of my apps (Terminal or Finder) ever save their position or size ... I wonder what I've done to break that? <comment154834> Hmm, I've just got Terminal to remember the screen size but I had to use the ShellUse Settings As Default menu option ... <comment154836> No such luck with Finder though ... so far ... <comment154837> How are you opening windows in finder. <comment154966> Just clicking on finder. <comment154987> I mean folder on desktop or folder in window.. <comment154989> Ahh, I think I get what you're alluding to, each folder has it's own setup?
