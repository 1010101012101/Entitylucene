How to save sent messages in Outlook to the same folder as message being replied to? <body> If I am replying to an email in Folder "TEST", how do I get a reply to automatically go to the Folder "TEST" as opposed to the Sent folder?  This helps with productivity so that I don't have to move the responses to the folders they are in.  If the message responding to resides in the inbox, the response will go to the Sent folder and can be moved to another folder at another time.
