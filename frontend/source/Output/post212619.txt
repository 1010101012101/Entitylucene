Unable to access neither Partition Layout nor Option tab in Partition tab on Disk Utility <body> I have a problem that I cannot select Option tab in Partition tab as shown in above screenshot. I wanted to convert my external hard disk to GUID partition table.  Thank you in advance for your help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6vaZL.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nNRoC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer212638> You can't partition disk1 freely because it contains a Core Storage Volume Group (disk1s2 - disk2).  You can revert to a non-CoreStorage by booting to Macintosh HD (disk0s2) and opening Terminal.  Enter the following to get all necessary infos:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  Example listing:  precode      CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found)     |     +-- Logical Volume Group A629E051-D7B0-4B8C-A803-074F62704636         =========================================================         Name:         System         Status:       Online         Size:         53946696192 B (53.9 GB)         Free Space:   16777216 B (16.8 MB)         |         +-&lt; Physical Volume 90C09FC0-4215-4871-901B-70E2C9C7D464         |   ----------------------------------------------------         |   Index:    0         |   Disk:     disk0s2         |   Status:   Online         |   Size:     53946696192 B (53.9 GB)         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume Family F6962E38-50E4-4458-BFE6-CF2E179352F5             ----------------------------------------------------------             Encryption Status:       Unlocked             Encryption Type:         None             Conversion Status:       NoConversion             Conversion Direction:    -none-             Has Encrypted Extents:   No             Fully Secure:            No             Passphrase Required:     No             |             +-&gt; Logical Volume BD36C73D-860D-4DC6-B125-AD624F448B88                 ---------------------------------------------------                 Disk:                  disk2                 Status:                Online                 Size (Total):          53496696192 B (53.5 GB)                 Conversion Progress:   -none-                 Revertible:            Yes (no decryption required)                 LV Name:               System                 Volume Name:           System                 Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  If your Logical Volume is revertible enter:  precodediskutil cs revert lvUUID /code/pre  em(lvUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume)/em  with the UUID of the example above  precodediskutil cs revert BD36C73D-860D-4DC6-B125-AD624F448B88 /code/pre  If the Logical Volume is encrypted you have to enter a passphrase.   After the conversion repartition the drive as needed.  hr  If the LV isn't revertible you have to copy the content of the volume em21Tech/em to another volume and delete the Logical Volume Group with:  precodediskutil cs delete lvgUUID /code/pre  em(lvgUUID is the UUID of the Logical Volume Group)/em  with the UUID of the example above  precodediskutil cs delete A629E051-D7B0-4B8C-A803-074F62704636 /code/pre  Then repartition the drive as needed.  <comment256731> Please add a complete screenshot of the Disk Utility window and the output of `diskutil list` entered in Terminal. The most important informations are missing. <comment256733> Dear Klanomath,  Thank you for the reply. I added screenshots as per your request. Please help me check. Thanks. :)
