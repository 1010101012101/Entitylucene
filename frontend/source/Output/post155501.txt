Yosemite and photos <body> I upgraded my mac to Yosemite and now I can't find my photos or video folder. My iCloud just has the 'loading' spinning circle so I'm not sure if they've gone there? Just can't find them anywhere!  <answer163922> With the plain screen, click on "Go."  Under it, you should see the "Home" folder.  If you click on it, you should find all your folders.  I have tagged them a certain color so I can easily find them.   Hope this helps!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ul1uH.png" alt="enter image description here"   <comment182914> Which application do you use to access your photos on your Mac? Do you still have the Pictures and Movies folders? <comment182945> And if you open Finder - preferences - sidebar! are they there and checked ?
