How to get the system language or the language that was selected when Mac OS X was installed <body> I know the common codesudo languagesetup/code to set the system language. Does someone know how to get the system language or the language that was selected when Mac OS X was installed?  <answer53278> The left part of codeosascript -e 'user locale of (get system info)'/code is the language selected in Setup Assistant (I think).  The language at the top of the list in the Language &amp; Text preferences should be the second line of codedefaults read -g AppleLanguages/code.  <comment61075> osascript -e 'user locale of (get system info)' is returning the locale as same as following code gives   NSLocale *locale;     locale = [NSLocale currentLocale];        NSLog(@"Current locale Identifier %@",[locale localeIdentifier]);                                         This is the system language for the currently logged in user right?not the default system language. <comment242079> @Akbar is correct: add a language in the prefpane, make it go at the top, run the osascript command and witness the change.
