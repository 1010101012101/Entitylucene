How to disable default alt-left / alt-right keyboard shortcuts for Numbers.app <body> I'm continually hitting kbdAlt/kbd+kbdLeft Arrow/kbd to move navigate within a cell in Numbers, and inadvertently inserting new rows.. How can I disable all the kbdAlt/kbd+kbdArrow/kbd shortcuts?  I've tried changing the Application specific keys in System Prefs  Keyboard, and my new keys work, but the old remain active.  Is there a tidy oneliner to paste into the terminal?!  strongEdit:/strong  Hmm.. I can't replicate the problem that I'm asking about! ATM when I  kbdAlt/kbd+kbdEnter/kbd into a cell to edit, kbdAlt/kbd+kbdLeft Arrow/kbd is not adding a column!  Maybe I'm mashing some other keys in there intermittently?  BTW, I've also tried setting kbdAlt/kbd+kbdLeft Arrow/kbd to codeBring All Windows to Front/code but that disabled using kbdAlt/kbd whilst editing the cell.  <answer91518> You can edit the plist directly:  codedefaults write com.apple.iWork.Numbers NSUserKeyEquivalents '{"Add Column Before"="\0";"Add Column After"="\0";}'/code  It overwrites custom shortcuts set in System Preferences, but you could also edit the plist in a text editor after converting it to XML:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.iWork.Numbers.plist /code/pre  <answer271158> Just had a quick look at this in Numbers.app 4.0.5, and I've found that by overriding the default keyboard shortcuts, the problematic behaviour is resolved.  Now if I hit kbdAlt+Enter/kbd to edit the cell contents, I can hit kbdAlt+Right/kbd and kbdAlt+Left/kbd to navigate the text without adding any new columns (holding kbdShift/kbd to select text works fine, too).  The relevant menu items to override are:   ul licodeAdd Column Before/code/li licodeAdd Column After/code/li /ul  Docs: macOS Sierra: Create keyboard shortcuts for apps  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1Rhk.png" alt="keyboard shortcuts"  <comment107453> bonus points for achieving this in any app! <comment107532> fantastic!! exactly what i was hoping for!  If I edit the plist in xcode, what type of value should I  enter for the key? I've tried string(\0) and bool(NO) with no luck… <comment107596> Escape sequences like `\0` only work in old-style property lists. You can use `&#0;` in an XML plist or a literal NUL character in Xcode's property list editor. <comment107749> hmm.. feeling dense! not sure how to enter a NUL literal into the plist via xcode.. I am: opening the plist, adding a key 'Add Column After' (string) then I've tried a couple of options: empty string, Ctrl-Shift-2, 'NULL', then opening numbers hoping that Add Column After will no longer work.. what am i missing? tx :) <comment107751> You can use `printf %b '\0'|pbcopy` or drag it from the Unicode view in CharacterPalette. <comment107820> sorry, Lauri, this looks really promising, but I haven't been able to get it to work in Numers'09 v2.3(554) on 10.8.3… I've tried pasting the `defaults write` into terminal, and pasting the result of `printf %b '\0'|pbcopy` & also dragging the NUL character into xcode… but no dice! each time, i'm ensuring that numbers is closed, and saving the plist before opening numbers… could you confirm the version of numbers this is working for? tx for yr persistence! <comment107841> Apparently it doesn't work for disabling ⌥← and ⌥→ in Numbers. This method does work with most shortcuts that have menu items though. <comment340808> The alt-right is dangerous indeed. And the alt-left...who knows? <comment340836> I someone else verifies that this works for them on OSX 10.12, Numbers.app 4.0.5 then I'll accept the answer...
