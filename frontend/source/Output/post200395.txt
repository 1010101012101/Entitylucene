OSX Yosemite Can't disable four-finger swipe <body> h3Intro/h3  I want to set a custom gesture for the four finger swipe left/right, but I noticed that four finger swipe was switching between spaces. I went in to system preferences-Trackpad and changed "Swipe between full screen apps" to be three fingers instead of four.  h3The Problem/h3  Even though I have set three finger swipe be the "change spaces" gesture, four-finger swipe hasn't been disabled and it is ALSO switching spaces.  h3What I want/h3  The reason why this is annoying is because I am setting a custom gesture with BetterTouchTool, the space switching is happening at the same time as the gesture I want.   I want four finger swipe (between spaces) to be completely disabled so it wont happen at the same time as my custom gesture. Because setting it to three fingers in system preferences seems to do nothing.  <comment284470> Was wondering, have you found a solution to this?
