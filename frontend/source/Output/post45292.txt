Macbook Air iPhoto does not see albums on the iPad <body> I have a number of photo albums on my iPad. When I connect my iPad to my macbook air and go to iPhoto I only see the photos in my camera roll.  ol liI want to transfer my photos on my iPad to my mac.

I need to get the photos onto my mac first before I sync./li liWhen I had a PC I could simply go to the iPad and select the photos and copy and paste them. I cannot find any place on the mac where I can browse the photos on the iPad?/li /ol  Am I missing something?   Please help. I am starting to thing I made a huge mistake getting the macbook air.  <answer45293> You could use a 3rd-party app such as the free strongWiFi Photo Transfer/strong to access all those pictures on your MacBook Air. It uses a web browser to access the photos, so you don't have to install any software on the MacBook Air or deal with syncing.  The whole process is easy:  ol liLaunch the app on the iPhone or iPad/li liOn your computer, you type in the address it tells you to in a browser./li liYou can then choose to either download a specific picture or entire albums./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ayEzv.png" alt="enter image description here"  Another benefit is that none of the pictures are sent to the Internet.  <answer45297> h2Use iPhoto for iOS/h2  You could download iPhoto for iOS, this will sync all your iPad's photos to iPhoto on your Mac.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3lDKO.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  h2Use iCloud/h2  This can also be done by enabling iCloud's Photo stream on both your iPad SettingsiCloudphoto stream - turn that on. (Obviously only if you have an iCloud account)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMCfl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then on your MacBook go to System PrefrencesiCloudphoto stream.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFbGL.png" alt="enter image description here"  These settings will enable photo syncing between your devices over the cloud.  <comment51596> I'm not sure iCloud will work in this case. OP says that the camera roll is already accessible, and I believe that Photo Stream only works with the Camera Roll. <comment51601> Camera roll is on the device whether or not iCloud is being used, Photo Stream is only active if iCloud is being used. <comment51828> have you progressed with this at all? <comment159488> I have the same issue, MacBook iPhoto doesn't see the albums I've created for a simpler structure on my iPad... Ridiculous, to say the least. Now it seems I may or rather must download another application or fire my albums off through the ether to access images which are stored in an album folder... Crazy! Very disappointing to say the least.
