Is there a way to resize on drag and drop in Aperture? <body> My photos are mostly 4000 x 6000 pixels.  I want to email smaller ones.  I use gmail in a browser.  Right now to do this I need to:  ul liSelect pictures/li liExport versions - select a size/li liNavigate in finder to the pictures/li liDrag and drop to my open compose window./li liClean up the created pix./li /ul  I can drag and drop full size pictures but an 6-8 megs each they make for obese email messages.  Is there a way to resize on drop?  Edit:  One comment asked about using an online drive, and working by reference. Tried Google drive.  To hard to find a given image, even with a few hundred, as GD doesn't know how to search for keywords in images. I have 25,000 images.  I don't know which ones I will share ahead of time.  I  want to keep one canonical copy of an image.   I need to be able to search by keyword, and browse the results.  Apple Mail:  Does NOT thread the same way that GMail does. Does not label the way Gmail does.  I use Streak, an extension for Gmail, that allows me to 'hide' messages for later processing.  This is not compatible with Apple Mail.  E.g. I could, from Aperture email a set of photos at whatever reduction.  This breaks the thread.  Now, depending on whether the client responds to the Apple Mail message, or the previous gmail message, I will now have two threads from the same customer.  Viewing them sequentially is much more difficult.  Gmail has no tool for merging threads.  <comment346965> Instead of emailing the image files, have you considered sharing them in a service such as Dropbox or Google Drive? There may be other sharing services. <comment346971> ..or using Apple's Mail, which adds a size parameter as soon as you drop an image into a mail. <comment346974> Edited question in response to IconDaemon and Tetsujin
