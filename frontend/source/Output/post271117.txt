Remember The Milk integration with Apple's Reminder? <body> Remember the milk, my absolutely favorite task list application has an integration with Reminder on iOS. But I do not get the same working on my Mac. Any suggestions ? THANKS   <comment340767> Have you asked the RTM developer if this exists? <comment340770> Yes, via Twitter. They said no, BUT the answer isn't quite logical to me:-). <comment340771> I mean if I can have a caldav feed on iOS, why can't I have the same feed on macOS ?
