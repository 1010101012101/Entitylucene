How can I do shift + slash on a French AZERTY keyboard? <body> I have a MacBook with a French AZERTY keyboard. On this keyboard, the forward slash ('/') is over the ':' character, so I have to do: kbdShift/kbd + kbd:/kbd to get the kbd//kbd.  However in Eclipse there is a useful shortcut to comment out blocks of code: you do kbd⌘/kbd + kbd//kbd to put "//" at the beginning of every line of selected code; and kbdShift/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd//kbd to put /* and */ at the beginning and the end of selected lines, thus commenting out the block of code.  But as I already need to press kbdShift/kbd to get the kbd//kbd, when I do kbdShift/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd:/kbd, it understands kbd⌘/kbd + kbd//kbd, and I get the first shortcut.  I can't seem to get the second shortcut. I even tried kbdShift/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbd:/kbd, using both Shift keys on my keyboard, and of course it didn't work.  I worked around that by changing Eclipse shortcuts, but I was curious to know if there is a way to achieve that (reaching kbdShift/kbd + kbd//kbd).  I hope you clearly understand this is a matter of the highest importance...  <answer21859> As described in several posts, the Ukelele program works to redefine the keyboard if you don't like the default layout.  You can at least find the right key using the Keyboard Viewer - steps on that are here: Where&#39;s the # key in Lion  <comment24077> I suggest asking the Eclipse people.  If there isn't such a shortcut now for your keyboard, they may be interested in creating one for a future version.
