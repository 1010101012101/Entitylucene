Cannot ping my local machine <body> I have just updated my Mac to macOS Sierra 10.12. My hostname is ninjaPixels-Macbook-Pro and if I run:  codeping ninjaPixels-Macbook-Pro.local/code  or codeping ninjaPixels-Macbook-Pro/code   I get an error of emunknown host/em.  codehost ninjaPixels-Macbook-Pro.local/code returns the error: emHost ninjaPixels-Macbook-Pro.local not found: 3(NXDOMAIN)/em  This is an issue as part of our codebase at work needs to run the following python: codesocket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())/code and it fails because my computer seems to have forgotten who it is.  I can successfully run codeping localhost/code and codeping 127.0.0.1/code  Iâ€™ve tried the following:  ul liRebooting./li liSwitching off the Firewall./li liChanging my local hostname, using System Preferences  Sharing  Edit./li licodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code/li licodedscacheutil -flushcache/code/li licodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist/code/li licodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist/code/li /ul  <answer253834> Assuming the Firewall is turned off, then in order to codeping $HOSTNAME/code, there has to be some form of sharing or service enabled in System Preferences  Sharing, strongor/strong add an entry to the code/etc/hosts/code file, depending on how/what you're trying to access by code$HOSTNAME/code. Example, code127.0.0.1 computer_name/code where codecomputer_name/code is what's reported by codeecho $HOSTNAME/code or in lieu of code127.0.0.1/code the actual IP Address of the Network Adapter on your system.  <comment315914> out of left-field... I've seen similar issues if IPv6 was mapped to localhost in hosts, mapping `::1   127.0.0.1` instead seems to fix it. <comment315919> @Tetsujin Thanks. I just tried modifying hosts with that but sadly no cigar. <comment315941> What Sharing do you have enabled, if any?  You need to have some form of sharing enabled (or Service enabled under Sharing) in order to `ping $HOSTNAME`.  On a clean install of macOS Sierra, Firewall turned off and nothing shared, I can replicate a `ping $HOSTNAME` error. It I turn on, e.g. File Sharing, I can `ping $HOSTNAME` from macOS and `ping macOShostname.local` from OS X on the same network. <comment315945> @ninjaPixel Do you have a dns server in your network, what's the search domain (in SysPrefs  Network  Interface  DNS) and finally what's the hostname of your mac (e.g. ninjapixel.example.com) if any? <comment315951> @user3439894 Thank you, you solved it! I needed to enable some form of sharing. If you want to post that as an answer, I'll accept it. Cheers! <comment318082> @User3439894 - I am experiencing similar problems. I have an old HP Laserjet connected to my router. I used to be able to print with Gutenprint - the printer has its own IP. Since updated to Sierra it wont work. Also there is a timeout when I ping the IP. How can I add the print to the hosts file? I tried with the IP and the name of the printer... <comment360512> Adding `127.0.0.1 computer_name` works for me. <comment366668> After turning on File Sharing `ping macOShostname.local` started to work, even *after turning File Sharing off*.
