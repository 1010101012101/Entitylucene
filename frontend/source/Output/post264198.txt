broken photos in iCloud Photos - can I delete everything? <body> I've messed up something in iCloud Photos. I have placeholders for photos going back through time to my very first digital photos (2002!), but they are only placeholders. When I click on the photos, iCloud Photos crashes. I can't select them, I can't do anything.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QIx2f.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U97qt.png" alt="enter image description here"  All of these photos are backed up, and I would really like to delete everything on iCloud photos and start over. Is there any way to do this?  <comment331062> +1 for having a backup :)
