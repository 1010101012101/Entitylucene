Switch to MacPorts SSH by default 10.8/10.9 <body> I've installed the MacPorts high-performance variant of SSH (codesudo port install openssh +hpn/code) but now I would like to switch the default ssh command over.  However, there appears to be some moral panic around degrading the sandbox (which was only recently introduced) but I am also worried about integration with OS X's keychain and my server keys....  What all do I need to softlink into /usr/bin/ssh or is there a better way to do this?  <answer112157> You can list the /opt directories before the system path and the shell will prefer the first match for codessh/code unless a script explicitly calls the system version.  By default, MacPorts lists /opt/ in your $PATH before the standard system paths.  I would inspect your code~/.bash_profile/code carefully to make sure there are no typos.   <comment131433> Wouldn't setting your $PATH be the obvious first and perhaps final step to using an alternate ssh? <comment131726> @bmike That's what I thought! It turns out there was a typo in my ~/.bash_profile that was (somehow) pushing the /opt/ declaration to the end instead of the beginning!  You should put in a real answer so I can mark it : ) <comment131732> Since you asked so nicely... :). What is the source of your icon. It's quite nice. <comment131734> I made it, it's my "logo"
