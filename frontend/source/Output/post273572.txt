How do I get rid of this Danish iWeb homepage? <body> Whenever I reboot my Mac (formerly 2009 13" MBP, recently migrated to a 2015 13" MBP) my Google Chrome homepage shows the following Danish iWeb help page. I no longer have iWeb installed, but I imagine it's followed me onto my new MBP via the Migration Assistant.  I've verified that my home page is setup correctly in chrome and if I close the Chrome window and re-open it my home page will be correct, so this problem only occurs strongonce per boot/strong.  Here's the window that I'm talking about: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VOAYK.png" alt="Danish iWeb"  I've never had my Mac set to Danish, but this Mac has gone through several family members and several OSX updates through the years.  <answer273578> As both @IconDaemon and another user suggested, I noticed the MBP was just opening Chrome without the user asking it, it was on boot. This led to the "Login Items" prefpane under User Accounts which looked like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne0qd.png" alt="Mysterious html file"  How did she get that code24538.html/code there... Once it was removed (via the minus sign), problem solved. I had no idea you could set a web page to open on login...  We cleaned up a bunch of these items after testing the removal of just the html file. Removing just the html file worked.  <comment343945> Is this a fresh OS X install? <comment343949> To clarify - does Chrome _open itself_ on login/reboot and display this page, or when you manually invoke the Chrome app _after_ a fresh reboot? <comment343950> This is a fresh install, but the Migration Assistant was used to restore from Time Machine and Applications/System Settings were both checked. I might be onto something with some help from another friend regarding iWeb.app, a remnant from ages ago. I'm currently hunting in the "Login Items" area. @IconDaemon it opens by itself. Good call. This was also what my other friend had asked. We've removed a suspect html item from the "Login Items" and are rebooting now.
