Restore all hidden Windows for all applications? <body> I have a pretty good idea what direction this question is gonna go, but I'll ask it anyway.  Is there any way or workaround to quickly un-hide all hidden applications? By which I mean, applications that have been tucked away with CMD+H and are normally restored with CMD+Tab when you want to access them.  <comment251295> Hidden windows are unwanted citizens of Mac, even the Mission Control does not show them! <comment251296> That's the hidden motive of my question. If you could unhide everything before firing up mission control, it would suddenly be useful :) <comment251311> Not really an answer, but [DragThing](http://www.dragthing.com/english/about.html) can do it by hot-key, so it is possible. <comment251465> @Tetsujin , nice, this looks very promising. Hopefully I can find a way to do it without something as full-featured as dragthing <comment251468> tbh, I've been using DragThing since 1995 (really;) & find it indispensable - but, of course, for a one-trick pony, I wouldn't insist it was your 'fix' <comment253010> It looks like Keyboard Maestro offers this option as well. This is slightly more sensible than using Dragthing, but ideally I'd want the secret sauce applescript that accomplishes this
