I need help resetting administrator information <body> I just got a 2006 macbook pro A1150. It's running version  MacOS X 10.6.8. How do I reset the administrator information? Please help me.  <comment342585> What do you mean by administrator information? Presumably you mean the password? <comment342745> Yes. I do not know the admin password and the person I bought it from cannot remember because it's been so long since the computer was used. <comment342753> I have tried the things listed on another question and none of them worked. I have an older operating system. I tried entering the commands in single user mode and the Mac doesn't recognize it or it tells me denied. <comment342765> That's odd - I remember having a similar issue with a Snow Leopard machine once and the instructions under "Create a new admin account" worked fine for me then. Could you show us the exact error that appears when you attempt those steps?
