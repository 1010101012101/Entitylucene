Google Chrome for OS X not detecting update <body> My version of Google Chrome on OS X doesn't seem to detect updates properly: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vuqJN.png" alt="enter image description here"  There is a new version (40.0.2214.93 as of this writing), as the Google Chrome release blog shows. It doesn't give an error code. How can I resolve this?  <comment199235> Have you tried completely quitting Chrome and restarting it, as well as restarting your computer? <comment199331> There was a restart installing the 10.10.2 update. Before and after that the same occurs.
