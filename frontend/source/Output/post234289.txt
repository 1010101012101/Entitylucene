File extension not hiding <body> I have a code.dmg/code file and I want to hide its extension. So I do the usual and code⌘I/code, then check codeHide extension/code. codekillall Finder/code just to be sure. I look and sure enough... the file extension is still there. So I use codeSetFile -a E myfile.dmg/code hoping that will work. It doesn't. Any ideas? Here's a picture just in case.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i2TN2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234343> That's the "get info" window and not the Finder. The get info window will (in my experience) always show the extension.  Hiding the extension is for emFinder views/em not the get info window.  <answer234347> Try just doing the basic thing by pressing codeenter/code and deleting the extension. The press codeget info/code to make sure the extension is still there.  Works on 10.11.4 emTested on OSX El Capitan 10.11.4/em   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djsZe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer234362> OK, I found the issue. Apparently two options have to be set in order for any extension to disappear (except for code.app/code). First you have to go into Finder's codePreferences &gt; Advanced/code. Untick codeShow all filename extensions/code. Then you tick codeHide extension/code in the codeGet Info/code window for your file and the extension is hidden.  <comment286524> I'm aware. I'm just showing my Get Info options in case I did something wrong. <comment286525> If you mean press `Enter` in regular Finder and then manually delete the extension, I tried that and it removes the extension entirely, as in it changes the file type from `Disk Image` to `Raw Disk Image` and doesn't show an extension in Get Info. Or maybe I'm not understanding your answer. :) <comment286661> Thats funny, i did that and it stayed as a dmg but the extension was deleted from the filename. What version of osx are you using? <comment286671> I'm using El Capitan. <comment286823> thats what im using and it worked. Hmm im kinda lost here <comment286825> Here's exactly what I'm doing as per your instructions. Go into Finder. Select my `.dmg`. Press enter (edit the filename), and press backspace until `.dmg` is gone. Then it gives me a warning popup. <comment286863> Whats the warning you get? <comment286880> `Are you sure you want to remove the extension “.dmg”? If you make this change, your document may open in a different application.` with `Cancel` and `Remove` as the options. <comment286913> Look at this article see if it helps https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19072?locale=en_US <comment286915> Im sorry if i cant help you, i tried my instructions and it worked. Do you have anything that could interfere. Filevault (i dont know, just brainstorming) <comment286931> Not that I know of.
