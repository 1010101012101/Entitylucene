Differentiate two instances of the same application in the dock <body> I usually have to launch different instances of the same application (in my case of Eclipse).  I launch them from the terminal as follows  precodenohup /Applications/eclipse/eclipse -data ${workspace} 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null &amp; /code/pre  where code${workspace}/code is different for each invocation.  Everything works well but for the fact that I cannot distinguish among instances in the Dock or while switching applications with kbdcommand/kbd+kbdtab/kbd.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PRWNf.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to differentiate them either by changing the application name under the icon or by dynamically changing the icon?  <answer65542> This is a solution for your particular issue, and not OSX apps in general on which I believe do not have this issue.   Workspace identifiers for Eclipse on OSX   <answer65567> It's not a great solution, but if you don't mind taking up a bit extra space, you could:  ul lifind some other icon, and copy it to the clipboard/li limake a copy of the Eclipse .app/li liin the Finder, "Get Info"/li liclick the Eclipse icon, and paste your icon there/li lifrom the Terminal, launch these two .apps, rather than the same app twice/li /ul
