My internal hard disk is 0 byte and a flashing question mark <body> I have been striving to bring my laptop to life, however, I am seeing a flashing question mark on my MacbookPro screen.   I tried disk utility and it is just showing me Media and it is 0 byte.   I ran DiskWarrior and it gave following error: An unexpected error occurred while communicating with this hard drives built in S.M.A.R.T. diagnostics, error -536870210, 28260C-  <answer93756> I installed a new hard disk. Problem was my old harddisk died because of shakes.  <comment91562> What brand and type of hard disk is in your system? Part#? <comment91596> It is what I got from Apple only. Segate momentum 5400 rpm 250 GB (I don't know exact name.)
