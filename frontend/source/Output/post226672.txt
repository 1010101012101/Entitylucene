Use old Powerbook G4's screen <body> I have a broken Powerbook G4 lying around and I'm wondering if I can re-use the screen, that is still fine. Maybe it's impossible, but is there a way to use it with composite video input? Thanks  <answer226705> strongYes, but it's not worth it./strong  The screen in that iBook is basically worthless: it's a small, not very good screen. You're better off spending any money on a slightly better display that–if nothing else–is larger.  However, if you really feel like it, you can do so.  First, you'll need to identify what display you have. Run the command codeioreg -lw0 | grep IODisplayEDID | sed "/[^&lt;]*&lt;/s///" | xxd -p -r | strings -6/code. This will output two strings. Copy the first one which should look something like "LP133WX2-TLC1", then search it. This will show you what panel it has. Using that info, search for it's controller. Using the same example here's a VGA controller for that panel.  This will allow you to  use it as a monitor.  Again, let me reiterate: this probably isn't worth it for that panel. You can get a larger, nicer panel for the same amount of money and time you'll invest. But if you feel like doing it, go ahead.  <comment275507> Thank you for the answer. Maybe you're right, it's not worth it, but what if I have a Raspberry Pi to use it with? <comment275599> @AndreaBR Still not worth it, you'd either have to buy the controller or figure out how to drive it directly from the Raspberry Pi, which is probably going to be a lot of work. <comment275600> Ok and how can I figure out the model of the panel if the computer is broken and won't boot up? <comment275601> @AndreaBR You can disassemble the computer and look for identifying info. I don't know which PowerBook G4 you have, but here's an [example teardown](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/PowerBook+G4+Aluminum+15-Inch+1-1.5+GHz+Display+Replacement/229). Search iFixit for your model (they have great guides) and follow it.
