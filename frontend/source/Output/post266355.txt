How to recover files from incomplete encryption of external hard drive? <body> I am on Mac OS Sierra and before the encryption of my external hard drive was complete, it was unplugged. Now it is not mounting automatically and when I force it to mount, only the main folders are shown, not the content inside them.  I tried running the first aid on recovery mode to repair the disk, however the "Conversion Progress" status of it is still 12%.  This is the result of strongdiskutil cs list/strong command:  precode+-- Logical Volume Group 377DF738-3760-41FC-820C-62EAEA0BE027 ========================================================= Name:         MYNAME Status:       Online Size:         999860912128 B (999.9 GB) Free Space:   0 B (0 B) | +-&lt; Physical Volume 093EC407-951E-4106-AAEE-5E59F03B900A |   ---------------------------------------------------- |   Index:    0 |   Disk:     disk2s2 |   Status:   Online |   Size:     999860912128 B (999.9 GB) | +-&gt; Logical Volume Family D7E0466C-FEC8-49B0-B64B-B4FD614D403A     ----------------------------------------------------------     Encryption Type:         AES-XTS     Encryption Status:       Unlocked     Conversion Status:       Converting (forward)     High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure     |                        Passphrase Required     |                        Accepts New Users     |                        Has Visible Users     |                        Has Volume Key     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume D084D812-5498-4E07-B733-B27B5E8CC6E4         ---------------------------------------------------         Disk:                  disk4         Status:                Online         Size (Total):          999508590592 B (999.5 GB)         Conversion Progress:   12%         Revertible:            Yes (unlock and decryption required)         LV Name:               DCResende         Volume Name:           DCResende         Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  Is there any way to recover my files?
