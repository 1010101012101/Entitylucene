How can I kill Finder if it's not responding? <body> I have some Finder windows that I just cannot close. They are completely unresponsive, and have the rainbow wheel whenever I select any of them.  Force Quit / Relaunch doesn't help, because the windows just get reopened again and they continue to be unresponsive. They also don't respond to e.g. kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdW/kbd.  Other applications are fine, it's just Finder that's stuck.  Is there a way I can force quit Finder without reopening all the windows?  <answer216105> Answer found here.  Open a terminal, and move the saved settings from Finder into a backup folder just in case:  precodemv ~/L*/S*/*finder.savedState Desktop /code/pre  Then, you can Force Quit Finder as usual using kbdCommand/kbd + kbdOption/kbd + kbdEsc/kbd, or use this handy terminal command:  precodekillall Finder /code/pre  Then, assuming everything looks good, you can delete the codefinder.savedState/code folder which has appeared on your desktop.  <answer216120> You can relaunch the Finder. Just press kbdctrl/kbd + kbdalt/kbd and right click on the Finder icon on the Dock. Then select codeRelaunch/code and it's done.  <comment261165> Relaunch in general didn't work - it opened all the unresponsive windows again which kept rainbow-wheeling. control + alt + right-click is a handy shortcut though!
