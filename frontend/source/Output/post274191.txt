Macbook hangs when removing HDMI cable <body> I have a very frustrating problem: when I remove the HDMI cable from my MacBook Pro (i.e. to disconnect my external monitor, and move about with the laptop), the screen just refuses to wake up when I open the lid. It doesn't react to the keyboard or mouse. It's a 2014 model, 13" Retina with Integrated Graphics.  What can I do to solve this problem of the MacBook hanging?  It goes via an HDMI - DVI adapter, in case that's relevant.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWVEH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer277767> Reverting to El Capitan fixed the problem for me with a mid 2014 rMBP, so it sounds like a Sierra bug. Hoping that the 10.12.4 release fixes it.  <comment344683> 10.12.3. What model details do you need beyond what's in the question? I don't put it to sleep first, no, just pull out the cable. <comment344685> I have also tried plugging in a USB mouse. The mouse itself didn't wake the screen up, but its light *was* on, indicating the computer has power at the very least. <comment344686> For 2014, there are two models, one with integrated graphics and the other with a second GPU. <comment344687> I think it's integrated: Intel Iris 1536 MB <comment344690> Try putting it to sleep first to see if that has any effect.  Also, I'm not a big fan of changing video formats (HDMI to DVI); I prefer to keep everything native.  Is your monitor cable of using HDMI or DisplayPort? <comment344691> I'll definitely try putting it to sleep first. It doesn't have HDMI, unfortunately, but there is a DisplayPort input (it's a Dell U2412M). <comment344740> I have this problem too! Genius at the Apple Store didn't know what to say when I brought it in, tried a full wipe then restore from Time Machine backup which has helped so far. <comment344741> Can you add a picture of the About My Mac screen to your question (Menubar - Apple Logo - About My Mac - Overview)? <comment344816> That's kind of an extreme option, but it's good to know that it might help, as a last resort. Also 'good' to know that someone else has this problem! I'm currently waiting on a delivery of a DisplayPort cable, which I'm hoping might help. Finally, I'm thinking that I may be able to workaround it by opening the lid whilst it's still connected to the monitor, *then* remove the cable to the monitor. I think that routine might help. <comment344839> maybe the Mac thinks its still connected. Try CMD+F1, which switches mirror mode on and off. <comment345030> @BobbyJack I have the same screen size, same mid-2014 model, same i5 chipset, same 16 GB of RAM, same Intel Iris graphics, and same version of macOS Sierra (10.12.3) on my affected Mac. Coincidence? <comment350899> Indeed, this is clearly a bug with macOS Sierra on the 2014-series rMBPs (probably only the ones with Intel Iris integrated graphics).
