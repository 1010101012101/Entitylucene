AppleUSBCDC weirdness after strange incident <body> I use my MBP propped on one of those laptop stands, ergo my external USB mouse and USB keyboard (both generic cheap-ass Logitechs) are always connected through a powered Belkin USB hub.  Yesterday I noticed the following — after trying to eject my iPod, my USB mouse started “slowing down”, the pointer wasn’t moving smoothly. Then both the mouse and the keyboard stopped working, the “laser” in the mouse went off. I noticed that the hub became extremely (!) hot and unplugged it. This is how it happened log-wise:  precode05.01.12 00:55:11,000 kernel: USBF: 29136.223   [0xffffff800b871e00] The IOUSBFamily is having trouble enumerating a USB device that has been plugged in.

I’m using the Belkin hub again, and so far it’s not heating up, everything works. However, every time I connect USB peripherals (=my mouse and keyboard), no matter if it’s the Belkin hub or one the built-in ports, I get something like that:  precode05.01.12 13:18:55,000 kernel: 0        0 AppleUSBCDC: start - initDevice failed 05.01.12 13:18:55,000 kernel: USBMSC Identifier (non-unique): 574341535531333731343832 0x1058 0x1001 0x106 05.01.12 13:18:55,000 kernel: 0        0 AppleUSBCDC: start - initDevice failed 05.01.12 13:18:55,000 kernel: 0        0 AppleUSBCDC: start - initDevice failed /code/pre  Mind you, everything works, and so far I haven’t encountered the “jerky mouse” problem or USB timeouts again. What’s going on? Is this normal? Have I somehow fried my Mac’s USB? :(  Thanks in advance for any kind of help!  <answer130478> I don't think you have anything to be worried about.  The AppleUSBCDC mentioned in the error message is related to "communication devices". This is usually a USB&lt;Ethernet adapter. Do you have such a device plugged in?  Try unplugging it and rebooting your system - I guess that will make the error messages disappear.  <comment152957> Do you mind sharing the exact product? Belkin sells conventional usb hubs, as well as network usb hubs.
