How do I allow a single IP to access everything on my Mac? <body> I tried IceFloor, but it's not working to white list all traffic from a single IP to bypass firewalls.   <answer52331>    The firewall in Mac OS X v10.5.1 and later is an Application Firewall,   which allows you to control connections on a per-application basis,   rather than a per-port basis. This makes it easier to gain the   benefits of firewall protection, and helps prevent undesirable   applications from taking control of network ports that have been   opened for legitimate applications.   You can not limit or allow access via ip address using the OS X firewall.  You can use ssh and set restrictions in /etc/sshd_config.  For limiting to certain ip addresses only see this answer.  <comment59795> In a specific way or just access? SSH? Remote? <comment59814> Initially it's a local IP accessing a webserver.
