Problem with iTunes Store and updating WhatsApp <body> So the problem is that I have an iPhone5 from my cousin, and yesterday I got a messages in WhatsApp from friends but I couldn't open WhatsApp. It said that I need to update WhatsApp. I went to the App Store and it required the password of iTunes Store but old email and password from my cousin, and I don't know the password.  Does someone have a solution for this? I also don't want to delete my WhatsApp because I cannot backup my chat history and also will not see the new messages that come in my WhatsApp.  <answer227044> It sounds very much like the phone wasn't wiped &amp; set up as your own new device.br This means that you will need the old login data for everything you need to do on the phone - this is not good.   You will need to get your cousin to make sure the phone is removed from his iCloud account, then you need to wipe it &amp; start afresh.br You will lose all existing data, but currently, nothing on the phone belongs to you.
