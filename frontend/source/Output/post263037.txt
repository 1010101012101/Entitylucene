problem brew upgrading boost <body> EDIT: System: el capitan, brew 1.1.2   I have installed boost some time ago, probably for some good reason (although I forgot why). The problem is that when I try to brew upgrade, the upgrade process always get stuck at the line  precode==&gt; ./b2 --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.62.0 --libdir=/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.62.0/lib -d2 -j4 --layout=tagged /code/pre  I have tried, several times, waiting for about an 1/2 hour but nothing changed. What happens is that my mac becomes warm and the fan starts getting noisy (something which I never see happen except in this situation).   I also tried to brew uninstall, reinstall boost. The (un)installation process is fine, but when I try brew update I again get stuck in the same place.   Has anyone a clue of why it is so, please?   EDIT: output of brew doctor is:  precodedyn905-151:~ sam$ brew doctor Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!  Warning: Anaconda is known to frequently break Homebrew builds, including Vim and MacVim, due to bundling many duplicates of system and Homebrew-available tools.  If you encounter a build failure please temporarily remove Anaconda from your $PATH and attempt the build again prior to reporting the failure to us. Thanks!  Warning: python is symlinked to python3 This will confuse build scripts and in general lead to subtle breakage.  Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/curl-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/freetype-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/libdynd-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/libpng-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/libpng16-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/python3-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/python3.5-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/python3.5m-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/xml2-config   /Users/sam/anaconda/bin/xslt-config   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python-config   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2-config   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7-config   /opt/local/bin/curl-config   /opt/local/bin/ncurses6-config   /opt/local/bin/ncursesw6-config   /opt/local/bin/pkg-config   /opt/local/bin/xml2-config  Warning: Your XQuartz (2.7.7) is outdated. Please install XQuartz 2.7.9 (or delete the current version). XQuartz can be updated using Homebrew-Cask by running   brew cask reinstall xquartz  Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework  Homebrew only supports building against the System-provided Python or a brewed Python. In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can interfere with other software installs.  Warning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed:   /opt/local/bin/port  This can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to temporarily move them out of the way, e.g.    sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports  Warning: Your default Python does not recognize the Homebrew site-packages directory as a special site-packages directory, which means that .pth files will not be followed. This means you will not be able to import some modules after installing them with Homebrew, like wxpython. To fix this for the current user, you can run:   mkdir -p /Users/sam/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages   echo 'import site; site.addsitedir("/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages")' &gt;&gt; /Users/sam/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/homebrew.pth  Warning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib.

Also why not `brew uninstall boost`, `brew update`, `brew upgrade` and finally `brew install boost`? <comment329549> what do you get when you run `brew doctor` ? <comment329568> Thanks guys. @klanomath: I did as you say and could upgrade. I then reinstalled boost, and tried to update again... and ran into the same issue (altough I know now that my other packages have been updated). <comment329569> @enzo: I edited my post correspondingly. Some warnings but no error. Thanks. <comment329573> Yeah, I forgot to add `brew doctor` in my comment. boost1.62.0 is the latest so you can't update it. I would try to comment out your current PATH (prob. in .bash_profile) temporarily, use the standard path (/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin) instead and rerun all commands to avoid any interference by macports/anaconda/other. If it works, something's wrong with your environment/path.
