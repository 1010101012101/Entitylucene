Is there a simple way for daemons and agents to communicate? <body> I've got a daemon that periodically checks for, and if applicable updates, some software (macports) and I'd like the user to get a GUI indication, using terminal-notifier, when that occurs.  Since daemons don't have access to GUI services, but agents do, I'm wondering if there's a simple way to make them communicate? By simple, I mean scripting or anything that doesn't involve compiling, as I'm not familiar with programming environments for OS X and it seems too daunting at this point, and too big a project for something like this.  <comment73167> You would need to compile anything that's code related or if you want to create an individual application.  Even applescript requires it's code to be compiled into apple events.  Would you like to specify what you want a bit more? <comment73168> Does it even have to be a daemon? The service in the [first question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/63117/how-can-i-write-to-notification-center-from-a-launchd-command) works if I just move it to /Library/LaunchAgents/. <comment73177> @theAmateurProgrammer I'm thinking of passing a string on request from the agent. One thing I've been contemplating is to have the daemon drop that string in a file in a directory and have the agent monitor the file using the WatchPaths key. <comment73179> @Lri for macports (which is run by the daemon) to do any updates it needs to run as root. That doesn't work with an agent. <comment73269> You could consider using `growl` instead of `terminal-notifier`. <comment73352> @mankoff I did consider that and I actually used that setup on another computer with Lion, where the daemon sends messages to `growl` which in turn displays it on the screen. A little surprising having learnt that daemons can't access the gui, and that `growl` can do that but not `terminal-notifier`. On my current computer with Mountain Lion however I'd like to not use `growl` and use the new Notification Center instead.
