Understanding "sending hex code" <body> Recently I've installed iTerm2 and customized key mappings.  For example, I wanted kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd to remove the entire line. In order to achieve this I created a new key mapping where kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd maps to codeSend hex codes: 0x15/code.  Could someone point me to the source where it is explained what sending hex code actually achieves.  <answer265111> It just sends the corresponding bytes to the shell. Same thing as "send escape sequence" but with different notation - the raw data otherwise represented by symbols and characters. It's then up to the shell to interpret this (usually through codereadline/code and code.inputrc/code bindings, or equivalent) into commands.   In your specific example, code0x15/code means kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdU/kbd, the standard binding for codebackward-kill-line/code. So when you bind kbdCommand/kbd+kbdDelete/kbd to send that, it works because you are just piggybacking on the standard bindings.
