Set meta/command/⌘ key as Launchpad shortcut? <body> I would like to set the command key code⌘/code as the shortcut to open Launchpad, is that possible? I've tried in the System Preferences, but it won't let me.  <answer221850> To make this work you have to use a third party tool: Karabiner.  In the customized keycode below I assume that you haven't enabled the consumer key function in System Preferences but have to access the consumer keys by using the kbdfn/kbd+kbdF1/kbd...kbdF12/kbd.  In the example below just the left command key launches Launchpad if hit once. A second hit will close Launchpad again.  You can use either the left or the right command key as usual otherwise (e.g. open files with kbdcmd/kbd+kbdO/kbd or print kbdcmd/kbd+kbdP/kbd)  ol liDownload, install and open Karabiner/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences/li liOpen the tab emMisc &amp; Uninstall/em/li liHit the button kbdOpen private.xml/kbd/li liOpen the file private.xml with an appropriate editor/li liEnter the customized keycode  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;     &lt;item&gt;         &lt;name&gt;When you type Command_L only, start Launchpad&lt;/name&gt;         &lt;appendix&gt;(Change Command_L lazy start Launchpad)&lt;/appendix&gt;         &lt;identifier&gt;remap.command_l_lazy_to_launchpad&lt;/identifier&gt;         &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyOverlaidModifier__ KeyCode::COMMAND_L, KeyCode::VK_LAZY_COMMAND_L, KeyCode::LAUNCHPAD, ModifierFlag::FN&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the file/li liOpen in the menulet Karabiner - Preferences the tab emChange Key/em/li liHit the ReloadXML button/li liEnable the remapping.

I'm a long time GNOME 3 user, and have got used to opening apps by pressing command, then searching and hitting enter. :) <comment268686> @ChristopherBayliss it may have been useful to know that `⌘+space` brings up spotlight which allows you to search for and launch applications. Having also used GMOME3 extensively in the past, I usually hit both keys with one finger when using OS X to save adding extra configuration.
