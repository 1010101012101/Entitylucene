App Store on MacOS Lion doesnt load <body> Since a while now, I can't use the app store anymore on my MacOS Lion. It just keeps the screen "One Moment Please. Connecting to the iTunes Store.".  I tried a couple of things ... rebootet ... waitet for days and tried it again ... cleared the cache, as described here: Mountain Lion Doesn&#39;t Download from Store and some more stuff.  Nothing shows up in the Console.app ... iTunes works just fine ...  The only thing that's curiouse is, that if I click on the link "To download iTunes, please click here.", the page shown is in swedish ... I've never chosen that as language on this system.  strongEDIT:/strong The login doesn't work. The credentials are correct, because I can log in at apples developers area and download stuff like xcode from there.  <answer89531> EDIT: Since you made your edit my answer is not valid.  In Apple store click on Store + View my Account  Sign in.  Bottom right just below the DONE click on the globe flag icon, and change to your country.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Zhtu.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment105096> The signin doesn't work as well ... no logging here either ... <comment105098> Just how do you get to apple developer without logging in to apple store? <comment105107> @Buscar웃 Logging in at https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action just works. But it does not work if I try it using the AppStore. <comment105110> Did you try to log out from apple store. <comment105158> @Buscar웃 How can I signout? Or turn the question around: Is it possible to sign in if you are already? I just see the "Sign In ..." and "Create Account" actions in the menu.
