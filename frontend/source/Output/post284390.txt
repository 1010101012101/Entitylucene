iCloud almost full <body> The majority of my iCloud storage is in backups. 4.2GB in backups for my iPhone &amp; iPad. I don't back up any photos, music or docs, just contacts, calendar, email and notes. Is this typical, 'cuz it seems like a lot to me?  <comment358630> Also, this same user posted ["Your iCloud storage is almost full"](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/284280/your-icloud-storage-is-almost-full), which has almost the same content as this question, yesterday. <comment358852> Yes, I did post a similar question, however, I am attempting to get more specific information and the answers I was getting were not relevant so I reworded the question. New to this site so, I'm not sure if asking 2 similar questions is discouraged.
