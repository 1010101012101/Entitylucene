Can Siri add some form of timestamp to a Note? <body> I'd like Siri to add a timestamp -- I'm not too fussy about the exact format -- of the current day and time to the end of one of my notes in the Notes app. She can find the note just fine, but takes me too literally:  "Add the current date and time to my UFO Sightings note"     strongOkay, I updated your note:/strong        UFO Sightingsbr   Jun 3    11:18br   Jun 5    11:28br   The current date and time   In hopes of getting some guidance, I then tried  "Can you add a timestamp to one of my notes?"  She asked which one, and when I told her, she cheerfully replied     strongOkay, I updated your note:/strong        UFO Sightingsbr   Jun 3    11:18br   Jun 5    11:28br   The current date and timebr   A timestamp   I asked about her capabilities in general, too, and got a list of example commands, but it didn't seem exhaustive at all:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7BuSm.jpg" alt=""  Is there a command I haven't been able to find? I'm willing to use this as an excuse to finally buy TextExpander (or similar) if necessary, though I'd prefer a built-in method.  I'm on an iPhone 5s running iOS 8.3.
