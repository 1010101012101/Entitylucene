Can I make a call from iPhone 5s via WiFi? <body> I have an iPhone 5s that ATT will not unlock.  Can I make calls via WiFi if the SIM card is still in it but I have no cell carrier? Phone is at IOS 8.1.3.  <answer174167> You can, but you will need a VOIP application for that.  Something like Skype works well over WiFi, since you can actually call phones (landlines or Cellular).  The Skype app is free, however calling phones is charged (but much less than AT&amp;T was)  As you know the only limitation is you have to be in a WiFi signal range.  <answer174173> There are 2 VoIP apps that are widely used here in Southeast Asia.   http://www.viber.com/en/#iphone  https://itunes.apple.com/app/id414478124?mt=8&amp;ls=1  Check them out.  <answer200665> FaceTime Audio works great, but only Apple product to Apple Product (iPhone to Mac or iPad to iPhone, etc.) I'd give it a try, just go to the FaceTime app and tap Audio on the top, then select or add who you wish to contact.  <comment205061> not enough to be an answer, as you might live anywhere in the worldâ€¦ but Virgin [UK] have an app for that. Dial from anywhere you can use wifi & it uses your home phone 'connection' rather than charging your 'mobile provider' <comment241835> Not sure why someone marked you down. +1 from me. I was going to add TalkaTone and Google hangouts to the list. All work great.
