How do I reinstall an app that was deleted but is still showing as installing? <body> I had Google Maps installed on my iPhone.  Out of the blue it showed that it was "installing".  I deleted the app, but it still shows that it is being installed and the cloud symbol appears next to the app when I attempt to reinstall in App Store.  <answer230604> I had the same issue with google maps however i think its just an issue with the iPhone because once i deleted the app and restarted the phone and then installed the app everything was working fine.  <comment281412> Have you tried restarting the phone?
