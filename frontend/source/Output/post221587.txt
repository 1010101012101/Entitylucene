How to make a clean install of OpenSSL on El Capitan <body> I'm afraid I have made a mess with the version (0.9.8zg) of OpenSSL which was installed on my Mac. While I was trying to update it, now I have some error and for some reasons applications like Apache or Google Drive do not work anymore and they don't even start.  I would like to know which would be the best way to restore openssl to a working version without re-installing the whole operating system.  How can I do that?  Up to now I have tried to download codeopenssl-0.9.8zg/code and build it with code./config/code, codemake/code and codemake install/code but it did not solve the problem. Please help me if possible.  strongUpdate:/strong    I downloaded emopenssl-0.9.8zg/em from the official site and I did the following:  precode./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc --prefix=/usr make sudo make install /code/pre  Now the commands outputs are:  precode$ openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 11 Jun 2015 $ which openssl /usr/bin/openssl $ /usr/bin/openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 11 Jun 2015 $ openssl version -a OpenSSL 0.9.8zg 11 Jun 2015 built on: Wed Dec 30 19:50:01 CET 2015 platform: darwin64-x86_64-cc options:  bn(64,64) md2(int) rc4(ptr,char) des(idx,cisc,16,int) idea(int) blowfish(idx)  compiler: cc -DOPENSSL_THREADS -D_REENTRANT -DDSO_DLFCN -DHAVE_DLFCN_H -arch x86_64 -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer -DL_ENDIAN -DMD32_REG_T=int -Wall OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/ssl" /code/pre  Still the problem persists.  These are some errors I get: for example, when trying to start Apache, it says:     Syntax error on line 111 of /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf: Cannot load /Applications/MAMP/Library/modules/mod_ssl.so into server: dlopen(/Applications/MAMP/Library/modules/mod_ssl.so, 10): Symbol not found: _SSLv2_client_methodbr   Referenced from: /Applications/MAMP/Library/modules/mod_ssl.sobr   Expected in: /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib in /Applications/MAMP/Library/modules/mod_ssl.so   but emlibssl.0.9.8.dylib/em is present inside em/usr/lib/em so I don't know why/what it does not find. Is it possible to fix this?  Or for example if I perform codebrew install libssl/code, I get:     Error: dlopen(/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin15/openssl.bundle, 9): Symbol not found: _SSLv2_client_method     Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin15/openssl.bundle     Expected in: /usr/lib/libssl.0.9.8.dylib    in /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin15/openssl.bundle - /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/2.0.0/universal-darwin15/openssl.bundle   Moreover Google Drive won't start anymore  <answer221596> Not sure if this is a complete solution but OPENSSLDIR is pointing to the wrong place. Also various compilation instructions include the "shared" option.  So try this and let us know how you get on.  precode./Configure darwin64-x86_64-cc --prefix=/usr --openssldir=/System/Library/OpenSSL shared make sudo make install /code/pre  <comment268330> Please open a fresh Terminal window, run `openssl version`, `which openssl` and `/usr/bin/openssl version` and update your question with the results. <comment268332> @AlistairMcMillan: done, I've just added them to my question <comment268333> Sorry one more command `openssl version -a`. Did you disable System Integrity Protection (SIP)? <comment268335> @AlistairMcMillan: done. Maybe yes...I am afraid I could have disabled SIP but I can't remember why...maybe to install something <comment268341> Also. Please update the question with the actual errors you are getting. :) <comment268343> I have added the errors message I get. I'll try at once what you wrote. Thank you for the moment <comment268344> It really seems you are my saviour! really thank you from heart! Now everything seems to run again, I also compiled and installed `openssl-1.0.2e` with the commands you wrote. Thank you. Can I just ask two more things? 1 - how can I clean up my macbook? Because I had triend many things before and I image there are a lot of rubbish files... 2 - I am afraid I uninstalled man. If I run `man something` it says "command not found". How can I restore it? <comment268345> Glad that helped. I'd really recommend turning SIP back on. :) Best not to make changes to things that are bundled with the operating system. If for no other reason than when El Capitan 10.11.3 is released there is a good chance they'll overwrite the things you've installed to /usr/bin. <comment268346> About your other questions... please log them as separate questions. I'll keep an eye out for them and try to answer if I can. :) <comment268347> you have been very nice to me as very few other people were.
