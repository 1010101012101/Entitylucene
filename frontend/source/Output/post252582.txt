Can I hide purchased music from the Music app in iOS 10? <body> At some point or another, I bought some albums on iTunes. In some cases, I've also ripped these CDs and imported them into iTunes. In older versions of iOS, I could hide purchased music from the Music app, but now that purchased music shows up, leading to duplicates like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mnChV.jpg" width="375" alt="Duplicate tracks"  Is there a way to hide purchased music in iOS 10?  <answer252666> Yes you can, using iTunes (make sure it is the latest 12.5 or newer version) click Library  Songs. Make sure you have the cloud icon column revealed and click View and make sure All Music is checked.  You should see all the music available to you for download to your local machine. Click the cloud icon to sort, select all the cloud songs, and delete. This essentially hides them from your view, until you go into Store  Purchased to view your history of songs you've bought in the past.  When you go into Music on your iPhone it should remove all those pesky cloud icon songs  I found this article, which helped me: https://www.igeeksblog.com/delete-hide-purchased-music-on-iphone-ipad/  <answer252667> This Apple Support page describes how to hide/unhide purchased music.     strongHide your purchases/strong      You can hide music, movies, TV shows and apps in iTunes on your Mac or PC.

I much preferred being able to log into match, DL the tracks I wanted to hear, then turn match off so the car stereo and other usb devices would only see the downloaded files. This ios version is an absolute calamity for music playout. Ripping cds is actually easier and cheaper than using the store now.    <comment322936> Welcome to Ask Different, Please elaborate your answer a bit more. <comment330822> Welcome to Ask Different!
