Keyboard Not Working in Bootcamp <body> I just installed Bootcamp and Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro (13 inch, 2010), and booted into the OS. The keyboard and mouse worked fine, but because there were no drivers, things like multitouch and the two-finger mouse click didn't work - this is as expected.  I went back into OS X Lion and downloaded the Windows Support package to my thumb drive, rebooted, and installed the driver package and the Boot Camp Control Panel. After I had restarted, my keyboard wasn't working.   The weird thing is, the F-keys emdo/em work and function correctly (brightness, volume, etc). If I change those keys to perform the F-key functions in the control panel (ie. require holding Fn+F1 to change brightness), the F-keys work correctly.  Any of the keys embelow/em the F-key row do not work at all. They don't type anything, no matter what program I am in. The Caps Lock key emdoes/em light up when I toggle it on and off.  I've tried going into the Device Manager and uninstalling the Keyboard driver and then scanning for hardware changes (which reinstalls the Apple Keyboard driver), I've uninstalled and deleted the driver (and then reinstalled it from the package in the WindowsSupport folder), and nothing is working. The keyboard appears as the Apple Keyboard in the device manager. The trackpad and everything works fine as well.  I checked the Language settings and it is set to United States (English).  Is there anything else I can try to get the keyboard working?  ul liWindows 7 64bit (emnot/em SP1, yet) /li liMacBook Pro 13 inch 2010 /li li8 GB RAM/li li250gb HDD, with 55gb partitioned for Windows/li /ul  OS X Lion (10.7.3) is installed as well.  <answer47820> strongBefore you do any of the steps mentioned below the line-break, check the bootcamp control panel first!!!/strong  When in Windows, after everything is installed and done, do the following:  ol liClick 'Start ' (the windows logo-button in the bottom left corner) /li liType 'bootcamp' /li liOpen the bootcamp control panel.

If not, read the answer that follows.   hr  When you installed Windows the specific bootcamp drivers should have been installed automatically from your Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) DVD or 10.7 (Lion) DMG in the process. I would recommend trying to:  ol liRemove/Delete the drivers in Windows Device Manager/li liInsert or mount the OSX DVD or DMG/li liRestart your system (booting into Windows). /li /ol  The correct bootcamp drivers should then be installed automatically from the OSX DVD. If the drivers were not installed, browse for them on the OSX DVD.   If all else fails you can always try re-installing Windows, and from there should be able to determine during the process if you have keyboard functionality.  ★ The key to having the strongcorrect/strong drivers working in bootcamp is installing them specifically from the OSX DVD or DMG.  hr  The Mac OS X 10.6 and 10.7 Boot Camp Software includes these Mac drivers for Windows:  precodeApple Bluetooth Apple Keyboard Support Apple Remote Driver Apple Trackpad Atheros 802.11 Wireless ATI Graphics Boot Camp control panel for Microsoft Windows Boot Camp System Task Notification item (System Tray) Broadcom Wireless Intel Chipset Software Intel Integrated Graphics iSight Camera Marvel Yukon Ethernet nVidia Graphics Cirrus Logic Audio Realtek Audio SigmaTel Audio Startup Disk control panel for Microsoft Windows /code/pre  hr  ul liBoot Camp 4.0, OS X Lion: Frequently asked questions/li liBoot Camp 3.0, Mac OS X 10.6: Frequently asked questions/li /ul  <answer47907> Here is a guide for making an install disc for Mac OS X 10.7.3  http://lifehacker.com/5823096/how-to-burn-your-own-lion-install-dvd-or-flash-drive  <answer48258> Your driver may be not the good one for your Macbook.

I meant OSX Lion install DVD. There is no OSX Lion install DVD going with 2011 macbook <comment54828> let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3020/discussion-between-geotavros-and-ioi) <comment54920> So I just booted back into Windows, uninstalled and deleted the keyboard driver, restarted, and installed the driver from my OS X install DVD, and the keyboard started working again. BUT, immediately after the install completed and I could use my keyboard, my TRACKPAD stopped working. Wonderful. After uninstalling, rebooting, and reinstalling the trackpad drivers, the keyboard stopped working again. I'm just going to give up and reinstall Windows at this point, and instead of downloading the newer Bootcamp drivers from Apple, I'll use my install disc drivers... I'll post back when that's done. <comment54935> Welcome to Ask Different! Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment58559> What version of Boot Camp are you using? Also, how much drive space do you have available in your Boot Camp partition?
