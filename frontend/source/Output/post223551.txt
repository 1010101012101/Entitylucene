How to uninstall Corel Painter Internal Audio Driver in OS X Yosemite <body> I had installed Corel Painter 2016 on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with its .pkg installer. I removed installed files from code/Applications//code by dragging them to the Trash.  Today I noticed that there is an additional item in the Output/Input Devices list at the menubar named codeInternal Audio Driver (Corel Painter)/code. How can i uninstall it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SicLa.png" alt="List of audio devices" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rMzlb.png" alt="Audio MIDI Setup"  <answer223566> It's probably in one of the subfolders of /Library/Audio/ but then I do not have any custom audio drivers installed... so I can not confirm that!  If you still have the Corel Painter .pkg file you can open it as if you were going to reinstall it and look for a menu option "Show Files" that will shows you a complete list of every single file it would install. You can then scan through and look for /Library references to get an exact answer.  <answer223579> I suspect Corel has for some reason set itself up as either an Aggregate or Multi-output  device in AudioMIDI  Applications  Utilities  Audio MIDI Setupbr kbd Cmd âŒ˜ /kbd kbd 1 /kbd to show Audio devices if it doesn't show automatically.  If my suspicion is correct, you will see one of the 2 circled icons, named after Corel.  Select, then click the - sign underneath to remove.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NssoD.png" alt="enter image description here"  This won't 'break' anything. These device types are user-created &amp; deleted. It will not allow you to delete any real device.    Boom2 may also have set itself up in a similar way, so make sure to get the correct one, if you wish Boom2 to continue working correctly.  BTW, it is highly unlikely to have an actual associated driver installed, it is merely a way of 'patching' outputs for convenience, all done using Apple's own routing capabilities.  <answer223799> I found a post about uninstallation of this audio driver. There is a kernel extension named codePainterAudioDriver.kext/code in code/System/Library/Extensions//code that adds the audio driver to the kernel space. To ensure that the kernel extension is loaded I used codekextstat/code:  precodekextstat | grep corel /code/pre  The result was:  precode  131    0 0xffffff7f80fde000 0x4000     0x4000     com.corel.painter.PainterAudioDriver (1) &lt;96 5 4 3&gt; /code/pre  Then to unload the kernel extension I used codekextunload/code that is explained here:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.corel.painter.PainterAudioDriver /code/pre  After that the codeInternal Audio Driver (Corel Painter)/code is removed from both Sound menu bar and Audio MIDI Setup. To prevent the driver from loading again while rebooting the system, the kernel extension file must be removed from code/System/Library/Extensions//code with this command:  precodesudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/PainterAudioDriver.kext /code/pre  The Corel Painter Internal Audio Driver is uninstalled now.  <comment271067> Thanks for your explanation with details; but unfortunately the minus sign is remained disable and gray when I select `Internal Audio Driver (Corel Painter)` item. <comment271068> can you add a picture of your audio MIDI setup to your question? <comment271072> There are 6 folders in `/Library/Audio/` named: MIDI Configurations, MIDI Devices, MIDI Drivers, MIDI Patch Names, Plug-Ins, Sounds. But none of them (and subitems) are related to Corel Painter.
