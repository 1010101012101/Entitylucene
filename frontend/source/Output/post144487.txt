Password-restricting access to any application on an iOS device? <body> Ok I have a iPhone and I would like to know if there a way to restrict access, via a password, to any application installed on the device?  For example: if I wanted to access a specific game or the Contacts application I would need to enter a password beyond what I had to enter to unlock the phone itself.  <answer144489> Parental Controls found in Settings  General  Restrictions is what I think you are looking for.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  <answer144495> Unfortuantly, at the moment, that can't happen with an unmodified device. However, if you are jailbroken, here's a list of jailbreak tweaks that could work (most are not free sadly):  ul liLockdown pro: comes in lite versions and pro versions. Pro version comes with SBSettings toggle and is $4.99 ($2.99 on iPad)/li liiProtect: Free trial, becomes $8.99 after trial ends/li liAppLocker: $0.99/li liFolderLock: $1.59/li /ul
