How to find a systems file on Mac <body> The answer to a previous question (that I share) suggested going to this file ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences.  How does one find that.  I don't know what ~/ references and the Library files that I find on my hard drive do not have a Container subfile  <answer145824> Simply copy that information,  then in Finder window use the "Go" tab  then paste the code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/Library/Preferences/code  in to the pop up window and it will bring you to that place.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/14FqK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  There are 2 Library locations on your drive.  One is the User Library, the other is the System Library  <answer145832> If you hold down the kbdOption/kbd key, your Library folder (code~/Library/code), which is normally hidden, will show up under the Finders strongGo/strong menu. Just selected it (Go - Library) and you will be there in the Finder.  <comment171836> ~ is a shortcut to your user's Home folder. Use the Finder Go menu to go to your home (or the go to folder tip that @buscar mentions in his answer). See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55408/how-can-i-see-my-home-folder-in-the-finder for more details on the use of ~ on OS X. <comment171911> @Tetsujin I was wondering if I should explain that :) , thanks for doing it.
