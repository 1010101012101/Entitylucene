unable to install Homebrew in Sierra <body> I am trying to install Homebrew on macOS Sierra 10.12.1 . All latest macOS and Xcode 8 updates have been installed.  I tried several commands in terminal:  precoderuby -e “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)” /code/pre  and  precoderuby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  In the first time I pressed Enter and then provide my password to install it, but I did not get anything that shows if Homebrew is installed successfully.   Tried again and this is what I get:  precodehanaas-MacBook-Pro:~ hanaaalshareef$ ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ==&gt; This script will install: /usr/local/bin/brew /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1 /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew /usr/local/Homebrew  Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort ==&gt; Downloading and installing Homebrew... hanaas-MacBook-Pro:~ hanaaalshareef$  /code/pre  then I kept waiting and waiting and nothing happened.  I tried this command :  precodehanaas-MacBook-Pro:~ hanaaalshareef$ brew doctor -bash: brew: command not found /code/pre  I found this in local:  precodehanaas-MacBook-Pro:/ hanaaalshareef$ cd /usr/local/ hanaas-MacBook-Pro:local hanaaalshareef$ ls Cellar              mysql Frameworks          mysql-5.5.29-osx10.6-x86_64 apache-maven        opt bin             sbin etc             share homebrew            texlive include             var lib hanaas-MacBook-Pro:local hanaaalshareef$ cd /usr/local/homebrew/ hanaas-MacBook-Pro:homebrew hanaaalshareef$ ls CODEOFCONDUCT.md    Library         bin LICENSE.txt     README.md  share /code/pre  Any suggestions how to solve this problem?

(just `echo $PATH` in terminal). <comment326220> link-only answer.
