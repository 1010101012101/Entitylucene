iTerm 2 style fullscreen for chrome <body> I am using yosemite  iTerm 2 allows me to full screen without switching to new space and preserves cmd + tab application switching via keyboard.  when i press cmd + shift + f in chrome it switches to a new space, and disables switching to chrome via cmd + tab - is it possible to full screen chrome without switching to new space and keeping cmd + tab functionality in tact (just like iterm)?   img src="https://i.imgur.com/5l64I8l.png" alt="enter image description here"  Notice my laptop screen goes dark when chrome is in full screen, whereas with iTerm, I can full screen and have access to both monitors   img src="https://i.imgur.com/w9jCHTP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment204289> Do you have "Displays have separate Spaces" on? <comment204291> no i do not, just 'group windows by application'
