Which application to preview .md files? <body> Is there an application to preview codemarkdown/code files (code.md/code files) on OSX (for instance on Maverick)?  <answer120625> The superuser question, Markdown Live Preview Editor?, provides a wealth of options:  ul liBBEdit/li liTextMate/li liMou/li liMarked/li liMarkdownLive/li liAtom/li liMarked 2/li /ul  In additional to those, you can install a markdown QuickLook plugin for Finder based previews.  h2MarkdownLive/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W1oVr.png" alt="MarkdownLive"  h2Mou/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WurCQ.png" alt="Mou"  h2Marked 2/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZnLo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer120627> The perfect preview tool for Markdown is Marked 2 which gives a preview of your Markdown and watches the file so that every time you save in an editor your preview is updated.  It also supports custom pre-processors so you can use extra markup such as critic, custom CSS so you can have a preview that looks however you wish and tools to export the result in a variety of formats. It can even track an entire folder and start previewing a different file when you start to edit it.  Taken together all that means that you can write your Markdown in any editor you like and preview and output easily.  You might want to think about installing qlmarkdown which gives you the ability to preview MarkDown files properly in the Finder using QuickLook.  <answer197648> If you are using sublimetext, then you can use strongMARKDOWN PREVIEW/strong package from package manager.  it has multiple styles like GITHUB, HTML and etc.  <answer197651> If you're using the Terminal, I made a thing in Node.  <answer206276> I would like to add the excellent - and open source - MacDown to the list.  <answer285410> h1Visual Studio Code/h1  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L1Pao.png" alt="VSCode Markdown Example" Source: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview  Microsoft's Visual Studio Code has been surprisingly pleasant to use as a general purpose IDE, and elegantly renders markdown.  (Note: the last answer was from 2015; so this is a "modern" 2017 answer.)  <answer291381> If you'd rather not install a new application, there are browser extensions for this. I use Markdown Viewer for Google Chrome, which allows Chrome to open markdown files and displays them like GitHub would. Then just set your browser as the default application to open .md files (or use open with if you'd rather have an editor be the default program).  <comment142398> The `QuickLook` plug-in does not work with `Mavericks`. <comment142427> Regarding the QuickLook plug-in, please consider adding your voice to https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/issues/29; or, as the project is open source, having a go at fixing up the code. <comment316760> http://alternativeto.net/software/mou/?platform=mac has updated list of markdown preview (and/or) editor <comment330760> Fyi, yhe QuickLook plugin does work with El Capitan 10.11.6 <comment367876> @Jackson1442 this actually is an answer providing a solution to the question asked. It could be improved by explaining in more detail how this plugin can be used to render locally-stored Markdown files. <comment367878> @patrix - oops! I misread this answer. *Really* badly! My apologies, Barry!
