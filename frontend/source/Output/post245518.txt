Numbers: Count number of payments, SumIf, CountIf, Concatenate Date, change data types <body> I am trying to create a spreadsheet that will figure out how much has been paid to date, from a list of payments in a separate row. I have tried many different options including using SumIF and CountIF. With both functions I am not receiving the desired result. I suspect that the date value in the expression is not being converted to a string. How can you change data types (date/value to string)? There are many functions that will turn a string into a date value but I don't know how to do the opposite and turn a date value into a string.  these are the formulas tried so far:  =SUMIF(2:2,CHAR(34)&amp;"&lt;="&amp;B5&amp;CHAR(34),Pmt)  where: CHAR(34)&amp;"&lt;="&amp;B5&amp;CHAR(34) = the expression = "&lt;=5/1/16"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wzJFx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  =COUNTIF(2:2,CHAR(34)&amp;"&lt;="&amp;B5&amp;CHAR(34))  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KAZOF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried moving the evaluation expression to a different cell and I have tried running the Expression (B5) through T() and Plaintext() to try to convert the date value to a string, with no success.  Please help, Thank you for your time!  <answer245524> I found the solution:  =SUMIF(2:2,CLEAN("&lt;="&amp;DATEVALUE(B5)),Pmt)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktZ98.png" alt="enter image description here"  The solution was the proper use of the Clean() function.  I'll Leave this up if anyone has a similar issue.
