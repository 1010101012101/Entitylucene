Authentication fails in Remote Desktop following 10.8 client upgrade <body> Following an update to Mountain Lion on my client machine where I have Apple's Remote Desktop running, attempts to control other remote machines still running Lion fail with "authentication failed" errors. The passwords I have for the remote machines are correct, and I can ssh to those machines without issues.  What do I need to do to get Remote Desktop working again? Ideally, this should be something I can do from within Remote Desktop or ssh, as physical access to the remote machines is difficult.  <comment68395> Did you apply the Apple Remote Desktop 3.6 Admin Update? <comment68396> @CoconutMan: The Remote Desktop app is version 3.6 (470.93), if that's what you mean.
