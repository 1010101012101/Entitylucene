Lost magnification under Mountain Lion <body> I am missing one nice feature after moving to Mountain Lion. I was able on Lion to press kbdcontrol/kbd and  drag with two fingers to magnify an area of the screen, which is particularly helpful when working with image editors that lack this function.  Was this merely a key binding that was removed, or has the feature itself been abandoned?  <answer98136> The feature is still present and you might be able to set it up again as follows according to this Apple Support page:     For example, if you have a trackpad and used the default settings,   zoom in by holding down the Control (^) key while you drag two fingers   up on the trackpad. Zoom out by holding down the Control key while you   drag two fingers down on the trackpad.   Check System Preferences = Accessibility = Zoom (under Seeing) to make sure that you have codeUse scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom/code enabled.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fv9Hb.png" alt=""
