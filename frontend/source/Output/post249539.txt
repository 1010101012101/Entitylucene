Unable to install Xcode using dmg file downloaded from Apple.com <body> I am trying to install Xcode 7.1 on OS X 10.10.5 using the dmg file downloaded from Apple. However, I have tried several times and the install always stopped at "Calculating size" when I dragged the icon to the Application folder. I waited for 2 hours and nothing happened. How can I install Xcode using the the dmg file?  My MacBook Air wireless adapter is damaged so I am unable to update Xcode from Mac App Store â€” the only way I can get Xcode is to download that dmg file.  <answer249541> Before doing this you need to delete the unfinished downloads and run this link in browser , which i mentioned below. You can find the DMGs for Xcode and other development tools on https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ (requires Apple ID to login). Link for Xcode 7.0.1 you can try this link. Hope this will help.  <comment309544> I can download. It is completed. I just can't install the dmg file to the app folder. <comment309545> you must clear the cache of previously download Xcode for that , go to application folder delete the Xcode and now try to install it again . <comment309546> what do you mean clear the cache of previously download XCode? Did I miss something? I just drag the unfinished XCode installed APP to the trash and empty the bin. That's what I did, every time. <comment309548> yeah.. while you being clicking on .dmg file corresponding app will be copy the some file into the application folder . so that things will come under package contents. So you just need to delete that Xcode fromApplication folder. hope it will work <comment309552> but it didn't work. Every time I cleaned things up. But Every new install is stuck at "Calculating size". I have tried 7.2.1 and 7.1.1. Both of them failed to install. It's so strange. <comment309553> Try clearing your cache, and restart the download from the app store. You can use third-party apps or enter this command in your terminal:  rm -rf "$(getconf DARWIN_USER_CACHE_DIR)/com.apple.appstore"
