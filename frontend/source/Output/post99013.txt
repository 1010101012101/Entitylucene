Can I view my iTunes wish list in the browser? <body> Can I view my iTunes wish list in the browser ?  Can I - for example - copy the link of my wish list ?  <answer100662> Just for Google folks, it is not currently possible to view your iTunes Wish List outside of iTunes.  <comment116343> How can I view it on iPad for example? <comment116346> @sameetandpotatoes <comment116349> I am so sorry ammarx, I just realized that I have iOS 7 on my iPhone and iPad and the feature that you mention is on iOS 7, but I did not realize that previous versions of iOS 7 do **not** have it. iOS 7 does have it though, there is an icon in the top right corner when you open the App Store that reveals your wishlist, but it is only iOS 7 :(. I deleted my previous comment so that others are not mislead. <comment116351> Ok. It seems that iOS 7 has amazing features. Thank you. <comment116388> Correction: it seems that iOS 7 has plugged some gaping holes ;) <comment116460> Yes. I agree :)
