Why iterm2 keyboard shortcut settings don't work on window launched using F12 <body> I've followed the instructions here on how to make kbdalt/kbdkbd→/kbd and kbdalt/kbdkbd←/kbd skip words backward and forward..  this works just fine on the original window displayed by iterm2.. however when i press kbdF12/kbd and the window shows up.. those keyboard shortcuts don't work any more.. any idea why and how to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GASzx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer252978> On the Preferences Window of iTerm choose emkeys/em and below on the left side you see the emHotkey Configuration/em. Choose your profile from the option strongHotkey toggles a dedicated window with profile/strong. And this should work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4i1yh.png" alt="enter image description here"
