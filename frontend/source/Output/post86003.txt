PageUp and PageDown keys for Irssi (IRC) in Macbook? <body> I cannot find the keys on my mackbook. I need them to go page-up and page-down in irssi (IRC). I have tested the tips here but they do not work. They model some different Up/Down, not the traditional Up/Down as on larger keyboards.  strongHow can I press PageUp and PageDown buttons with Macbook? Irssi is running behind ssh and GNU Screen with UTF8 support./strong  <answer86004> kbdfn/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdUp/kbd/kbdDown/kbd  IIRC in previous versions of Mac OS X (Lion or perhaps earlier), fn had to come first. But I just tested fn vs. shift first and neither had a different effect.  This may be Terminal.app specific, and may not work in iTerm 2. YMMV  <answer92369> It took me a while to guess that and I didn't find anything on Google, so at least, if somebody needs it, it's kbdfn/kbd + kbdUp/kbd/kbdDown/kbd in iTerm 2.   <answer137094> I'm using irssi on Mavericks. For me it was kbdfn/kbd + kbdshift/kbd+ kbdUp/kbd/kbdDown/kbd  <answer160165> I'm using irssi within tmux on Yosemite.   When using laptop keyboard (no number pad) this works: kbdfn/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbdup/kbd/kbddown/kbd   When using a standard keyboard kbdshift/kbd + kbdpage up/kbd/kbdpage down/kbd   <answer242455> In Terminal, go to Preferences...  Profiles. Click your 'Default' profile or the one you're currently using. Click the 'Keyboard' tab. Click 'Use Option as meta key'. Now Option-P and Option-N will do page back and page up.  Control-P and Control-N are view page up/down... so it's super nice.  <answer247929> On El Capitan with standard keyboard I got just kbdpage up/kbd/kbdpage down/kbd buttons to work fine out of the box.  <comment101959> Thank you! Worked like charm with mountain lion, happy easter! <comment290984> Brilliant, this saved me! I've used fn-shift-up/down for years and just upgraded to El Capitan and spent several days in confusion... <comment291096> Ha, glad I could help! It's weird that this still gets upvotes when I'm not even using a Mac anymore, though. Something missing in iTerm's docs?
