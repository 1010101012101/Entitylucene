How can I fix that Photos for macOS re-imports old photos as new... creating several duplicates <body> I'm using the iCloud photo mediathek from my own iPhone and sync it to my MacBook where I use Photos. That works fine... there have been no problems with this so far.  I've also started to import photos from my wife's iPhone using the usb-lightning connector. On the first import Photos took roughly 3000 photos and added them to my library. This worked fine too.  strongThe Problem/strong  Every time I want to import the new photos this way the app also re-imports several (around 600) photos over and over again... selecting them as new. But they aren't new! This way I've already created several duplicates.  Is this normal behaviour? I don't think so... but I've no clue on how to solve this.  At the moment I'm trying to clean this mess up using PhotoSweeper... but I'd like to avoid this at all. Any ideas?
