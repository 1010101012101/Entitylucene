How do I turn iMessages off in OS X? <body> How do I turn iMessages off on my MacBook? I have tried to go to settings but those were in the old version! I don't know how to turn it off in the new version.  <answer181298> Assuming the version of OS X is 10.10 (Yosemite):  Go to codeSystem Preferences/code and click codeInternet Accounts/code.  Choose an appropriate account, and deselect codeMessages/code from the list of selected applications.  <answer181313> As mentioned in one of the comments already, within Messages go to codePreferences &gt; Accounts/code and highlight the iMessage account.  There either untick the box for Enable this account or sign out of iMessage, which will effectively disable the account.  <comment215583> I don't see Messages in that pref - everything else iCloud-related but not Messages. iMessage sign & out is in the Messages app prefs itself, accounts tab. Uncheck Enable this account. <comment215595> This only works if disabling messages for Google, AIM, (supported internet acct. with messaging service), but *not* for iMessage. As @Tetsujin mentioned, disabling the latter must be done in the Messages.app itself.
