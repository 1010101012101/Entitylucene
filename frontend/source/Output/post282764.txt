Currently, this option can only be         used to recover files covered by whiteouts. /code/pre  So it can't be used to recover files deleted by the usual means.  For a (rather short) explanation of whiteout see https://askubuntu.com/questions/39826/what-does-whiteout-mean-in-a-copy-on-write-filesystem. A slightly better explanation I found on discussions.apple.com:     A whiteout node is used are part of a union file system mount, where a 2nd file system is mounted over a base file system, and the files in both file systems appear to be merged.      When you delete a file in the union file system which happens to be in the bottom layer (which is effectively read-only), the top layer gets a whiteout node created to indicate that the bottom layer file should not be returned on a directory lookup.      So while I did not find anything about deleting a whiteout node, my theory is that maybe if you create a real file or directory with the exact same name as the whiteout node you created, the file system will automatically remove the whiteout node. Or try renaming a file to the same name as the whiteout node.
