AppleScript bundle: expose other interactive scripts? <body> Assuming that I've created script bundle (.scptd), is there a way to expose (for lack of a better term) other interactive scripts?  Alternate scripts might preform configuration tasks or secondary tasks.  I really want to reuse the script files (call them libraries) that are in the bundle and leverage the containment of the script.  One option, I suppose, is to create symlinks or aliases to scripts that are in the code.scptd/Contents/Resources/Scripts/code directory.  Are there other options?
