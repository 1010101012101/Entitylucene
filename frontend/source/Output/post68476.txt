Can I have an Encrypted Partition in a 2 Partitions USB Stick? <body> I have a new 16Gb USB key and want to take advantage of Disk Utilities feature to encrypt it, however I do need to move data from Mac to Windows from time to time.   Is is it possible to have one FAT partition and one Mac OS Extended Encrypted Partition on a 16Gb drive? I've tried a number of times but cannot figure it out.  Thanks.  <answer68482> strongYes/strong. It's pretty straight forward, to do so just:  ol liGo to strongApplications / Utilities / Disk Utilities/strong. /li liSelect the USB device and click emPartitions/em./li liChoose the number of partitions you want and resize them as needed./li liChoose the format of each partition and click *Apply./li liOnce mounted on the Finder, kbdControl/kbd+Click the emMac OS Extended/em partition and choose strongEncrypt/strong./li liYou'll be prompted  to choose a password. Enter it and click emEncrypt Disk/em./li listrongWait/strong. Unfortunately, there is no progress bar, so you won't know exactly how long will it take. I just did it with a strong4 GB/strong USB drive and it took from strong5/strong to strong10 minutes/strong./li /ol  And it is done.   <answer68484> Ok I found this thread hidden away in the Apple communities and it provided the solution. I was trying to do it through the Finder, I went back and tried it again using Disk Utility and it worked.

"The given file system is not supported on Core Storage". I also made sure my my partition scheme is GUID. <comment261136> You can monitor the progress by calling "diskutil cs list" on the command line: Conversion Progress:   0%
