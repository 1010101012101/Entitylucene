Where does iTunes Match store songs on my iDevice? <body> I know in a regular situation (without iTunes Match), the music is stored in code/User/Media/iTunes_Control/Music/code. However, all of my codeFXX/code folders are empty. Does iTunes Match cache files in a different location than the regular iOS iPod storage place?   I am running iOS 5.0.1 on iPhone 4S.  Edit: I deleted all my codeFXX/code folders, and my entire codeMusic/code folder and my music still plays. Does anyone have an idea how I can find where these songs, and/ or a database file are downloaded?  <answer50945> look at  precode/var/mobile/Media/Purchases/ /code/pre  <comment59417> Thank you. You are the master of the universe.
