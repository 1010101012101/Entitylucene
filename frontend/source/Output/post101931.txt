Print All Files in Folder and SubFolders <body> I had 5 folders each with a couple of files (2-3).   I wanted to print all of them in one shot. I found ways to do it in Linux but I couldn't get them to work here.   The two alternatives I found for Linux were:     find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -t      find . -type f -printf "%T@ %p\n" | sort -nr | cut -d\  -f2-   How do I accomplish this on a Mac?  I'd prefer not downloading any package for this and to accomplish this solely through terminal.  <answer101941> An easy way to get the same result is  precodefind . -type f /code/pre  which basically is identical to  precodefind . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n 1 ls /code/pre  <answer101948> POSIX requires specifying the path argument for codefind/code (like codefind ./code instead of codefind/code) and code-printf/code is a GNU extension.  List regular files sorted by modification date:  precodefind . -type f -exec stat -f'%m %N' {} + | sort -rn | cut -d' ' -f2- zsh -o dotglob -c 'printf %s\\n **/*(.om)' /code/pre  List regular files:  precodefind . -type f zsh -o dotglob -c 'printf %s\\n **/*(.)' /code/pre  List all files (including directories):  precodefind . shopt -s globstar dotglob; printf %s\\n ** # bash 4.0 or later brew install tree; tree -a . # -a includes files that start with . mdfind 'kMDItemFSInvisible=1||kMDItemFSInvisible=0' -onlyin . /code/pre  List only directories:  precodefind . -type d shopt -s globstar dotglob; printf %s\\n **/ # bash 4.0 or later tree -ad . /code/pre  <comment120078> What happens if you try the commands in Terminal? <comment120082> -t is not recongnized and printf not defined respectively. <comment120085> It's `find` complaining about `-t`, not `ls` :-) <comment120108> The `-t` in your `ls` command is superfluous.  `find` does not do any time-based ordering; and, as only one file at a time is passed to xargs, sorting the one file at a time by the file's date (as `-t` would normally do) is not very useful. <comment120119> Good point, fixed. Thanks
