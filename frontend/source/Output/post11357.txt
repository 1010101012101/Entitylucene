Adjust fan speed on ATI graphics card in OS X? <body> I just got an Apple 4870 and am using it with OS X fine. However it is soooo noisy.   Are there any software tools or firmware mods I can do to change the fan speed at various temperature thresholds?   <answer11365> Solved: Edited and reflashed the rom from this guide:  http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=227787  Worked an absolute treat
