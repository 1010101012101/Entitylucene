Changing Info.plist values via terminal <body> I am making my own application and I would like to change some values in my Info.plist file using terminal.  I have tried doing codedefaults write Info.plist CFBundleExecutable -string &lt;Executable&gt;/code and codedefaults write Info.plist CFBundleExecutable &lt;Executable&gt;/code however it never seems to work. I don't get any output so I don't even know what it is i'm doing wrong.  Thanks for the help  <answer173473> You can use codedefaults/code or codeplutil/code command line tools.  For codedefaults/code it looks like this:  precodedefaults write /absolute/path/to/Info.plist CFBundleExecutable -string &lt;Executable&gt; /code/pre  For codeplutil/code:  precodeplutil -insert CFBundleExecutable -string &lt;Executable&gt; Info.plist  /code/pre  Value after code-insert/code is a key path separated by code./code. For example   precodeplutil -insert CFBundleDocumentTypes.0.CFBundleTypeExtensions.1 -string "scss" /Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  will insert "scss" string deep in the path. Numbers after code./code are for arrays (they are starting with code0/code).  <comment204080> Can You try absolute path to Your Info.plist file? It works for me (P.S. after this plist is in binary format) <comment204082> That worked! If you add it as a answer I will up-vote and accept it so you get reputation for it. <comment277587> Thanks, but how can you insert into a deeper level of the plist (say add an item to some internal dictionary)? Here you merely present the key, the type and the value - but no key-path. <comment277589> @MottiShneor I've added example for deeper key path.
