Background menu bar stuff visible through current menu bar <body> So this is happening to my menu bar(Look carefully at the menu bar).Looks like menu bar of other apps is visible through it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CBhfj.jpg" alt="Screenshot"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8L3QA.png" alt="screenshot"  Making the menu bar opaque solves it but I liked the transparent thingy.  Have restarted the computer but it's still the same.Any idea on what's causing this?  <answer116579> Your desktop background is a screen-shot that includes a menu bar. Try going into codeSystem Preferences &gt; Desktop &amp; Screen Saver &gt; Desktop/code and choosing a different background.
