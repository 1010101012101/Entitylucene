iPhone 6s noticeably slower (geekbench) <body> I have got an iPhone 6S on October of 2015.  Sometime in 2016, I downloaded Geekbench 3, to benchmark the device.  My baseline results are: (5 runs)  precodeSingle: ~2500 (2450-2550) Multi: ~4400 /code/pre  Now, I feel like my iPhone is becoming slower, so I did the benchmark again. (11 months later)  My new results are: (5 runs)  precodeSingle: ~1500 (1200-1800) Multi: ~2100 /code/pre  And it seems that it is somewhat dependent on the battery percentage (low battery = low result. but even 100% battery is ~1700)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/htIyO.png" alt="enter image description here"  I understand these are synthetic benchmarks, and are not fully representing the device's performance, but it seems odd, and I want to know if my device is defective? Do I have a case for a phone replacement? Or, am I reading too much into it, and devices just decay over time?  emNote:/em I'm not sure if this is relevant, but my device is part of the apple recall for battery replacement, but because the apple re-seller in my country does not supply phone replacement, I did not change it.  <comment354517> @books453 Visible on the image. iOS 9.3.2 / 10.3.1 <comment354518> oh sorry I didn't notice that. <comment354524> I don't understand the following: _my device is part of the apple recall for battery replacement, but because the apple re-seller in my country does not supply phone replacement, I did not change it._ This was a recall to replace the battery, not the phone itself. Regardless, if you're eligible just phone Apple and they will make an appointment/arrangements to action the recall. That should be the first thing you do. Both mine and my wife's iPhone 6s batteries were replaced and this adds quite a bit of longevity to the phone. <comment354525> @Monomeeth I understand I need to replace the battery, but I am not sure that this is why performance is down. I didn't replace because for the 5 days it's gonna be in the lab, I won't have a phone <comment354532> Yes, but troubleshooting is a process of elimination and in your case replacing the battery is one obvious place to start. You've already stated that your Geekbench results seem _somewhat dependent on the battery percentage_, so presumably this will make a difference. Another factor that can impact scores include whether your phone is in low power mode (usually reduces single core scores by about 36% and multi core scores by roughly 39%). My iPhone 6s typically gets just over 2500 for single core and around 4400 for multi core scores. It's on iOS 10.3.1 and has a new battery from the recall.
