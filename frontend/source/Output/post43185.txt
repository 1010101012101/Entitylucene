How can I set caps lock to a more complex keystroke? <body> In the Keyboard settings, it is possible to set Caps Lock to other modifier keys, but it doesn't allow to put in a custom keystroke.  Is it possible to set it to something like kbdCtrl/kbd + kbdA/kbd?  I'm using OS X Lion 10.7.3 if that's of any relevance.  <answer43188> h2PCKeyboardHack/h2  allows to change the caps lock key behavior. It's mac software, even tough the name may not suggest it :).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uqyp0.png" alt="enter image description here"  (pic from developer's website)
