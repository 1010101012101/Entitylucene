Can I retrieve text messages if I backed up to wrong date? <body> I backed up to an old date in icloud and lost recent text messages when upgraded to ios 7.  Can I somehow find those more recent text messages?  If not, can the Apple store find them?  <answer104364> If you did not have a recent back-up of your device (on iCloud or iTunes), there is emno way/em, after a restore, you can get your SMSs back.  <comment122829> You mean you restored to an older backup after the upgrade to iOS 7? <comment122843> When restoring from iCloud, did you choose the last version available? <comment122844> Or do you have a recent iTunes back-up?
