Can a Mac be programmed to simulate pressing a key at a certain rate via software? <body> Is there a way or a 3rd party application which would let me specify, for example, that I want it to send a keyboard event (so that it has the same effect as physically hitting the key on the keyboard) every 5 seconds?  So, for example, I could tell it to hit kbdK/kbd every 5 seconds, 15 times in total?  Basically, I'm looking for something like AutoHotkey but for OS X.  <answer63899> I found a way to do this in a bash script:  precode#!/bin/sh # Simulates hitting a key on OS X # http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/63899/72339  echo "tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"$1\"" | osascript /code/pre  Save as codehitkey/code, codechmod +x hitkey/code, codehitkey k/code to hit kbdK/kbd.  From there it's simple to use Automator to loop over the script several times or make an iCal alarm to initiate the script at a specific time.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSTwL.png" alt="Automator document types"  <answer63903> Here's an AppleScript to do what you want:  precodeset i to 0 repeat while i &lt; 15     set i to i + 1     delay 5     tell application "System Events" to keystroke "k" end repeat /code/pre  You can inline it in a shell script like this:  precodeecho "set i to 0 repeat while i &lt; 15 set i to i + 1 delay 5 tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"k\" end repeat" | osascript /code/pre  (Thanks to @houbysoft for the codeecho "script" | osacript/code syntax!)  <comment73908> Doesn't that miss the whole "repeat every 5 seconds for a total of 15 times" part? <comment73909> I didn't know about the `echo "script" | osascript` syntax - I've always used `osascript -e "script"`. So you get +1 for that. <comment73913> @DanielLawson: yes, but having the shell script it's simple to loop it however you want.
