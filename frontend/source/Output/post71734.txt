What causes chmod to not work on an ssh file in OSX? <body> I am trying to mount private keys from USB stick. OSx does not allow me to change their permissions, why? How can I change them? In other words, how can I add private keys from random USB stick to ssh-agent?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7SL4D.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer71737> You can solve this problem with  precode$ cp /Volumes/disk/.ssh ~ $ eval `ssh-agent` $ chmod 400 ~/.ssh/* $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/school /code/pre  but this does not solve the original prob i.e. without copying ssh-keys to computer to add keys to the daemon  <answer71739> I'll bet your USB stick is formatted as FAT, FAT32 or NTFS. OS X's Unix-style permissions are not compatible with FAT and FAT32 filesystems. Additionally, by default, OS X cannot write to NTFS volumes. Make sure the USB stick is formatted as HFS+.  And finally, the file containing the SSH private key strongmust/strong have permissions set to code600/code and the folder containing the file strongmust/strong have permissions set to code700/code  <comment83420> Why 600 and not 400? They need just read -access, where do you need write access for files? Any idea how can I create OS X -style fs with non-mac -devices? This is going be a problem if I use many systems. <comment83427> You can try 400 instead of 600. I suggested 600 because that's what I have on my system.  ...  To make your USB stick a "Mac device" just format it using Disk Utility.app. <comment86998> Can you run an ls -l on school to show it's current perms? In addition to the file itself, SSH gets grumpy if the permissions on the directory they're in are open. Make sure that .ssh has restrictive perms, I think 600 is good, from memory. <comment86999> ...err execute permission is too much. Read permission is enough i.e. 400. You can see the current perms in the picture i.e. 777 -- OSx automounts the USB to everyone apparently in the system, now trying to find a way to do it without copying files to the disk. Please, see my answer for a way to solve it, not the safest method but works. <comment87000> You need execute on a directory to see what it's contents are. <comment87003> This worked for me: sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
