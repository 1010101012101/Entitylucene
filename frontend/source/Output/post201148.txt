Apple CDN direct download links <body> last time a new update for El Capitan was available, my MacBook always got stuck in the middle of downloading the new update through the AppStore. So I tried to google my problem and found a discussion on Apple's website:  https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/13504  There somebody posted the answer to download the update directly from Apple's CDN. How can I get the direct link for the update? Is there a "special" website where I can search Apple's CDN?
