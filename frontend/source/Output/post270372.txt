Pressing w after cmd-` causes window close <body> strongSummary/strong  I'm running into a curious behavior where pressing kbdw/kbd after kbdcmd/kbd-kbd`/kbd (to switch windows of an application) causes the switched-to window to close, as if I had input kbdcmd/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbdw/kbd, rather than just inputting kbdw/kbd. This has arisen several times where I'm switching between Chrome windows and typing a message in one of them; when I switch back and start typing a word that begins with "w" that window closes.   Running Sierra (10.12.2). Reproduced on Mac Pro and on 13in Macbook Pro after restart.  I am running various background applications but wanted to see if anyone could reproduce this first.   strongSteps to reproduce:/strong  ol liOpen any application that supports multiple tabs and multiple windows. I tested this with Google Chrome and with Sublime Text 3./li liOpen two windows, each with two tabs./li liTry using the kbdcmd/kbd-kbd`/kbd shortcut to switch between windows. /li liAfter switching between windows with kbdcmd/kbd-kbd`/kbd and letting go of those keys, quickly press kbdw/kbd./li /ol  strongExpected:/strong kbdw/kbd gets input into the window I just switched to.  strongActual:/strong The window closes, in the same way that it would if I had input kbdcmd/kbd-kbdshift/kbd-kbdw/kbd.   <comment339777> Currently running 10.12.2 on a 2015 Macbook; could not reproduce the issue. Have you configured any custom shortcuts on your machines from either 'System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts' or a 3rd party application? <comment339778> Running 10.12.2 on a 2013 MacBook Pro and cannot reproduce unless the âŒ˜ key is still pressed when the W key is pressed. (Which of course should close the window Tab then.) <comment339799> Does it happen in safe mode or in a different user account?
