Update iPod touch OS remotely <body> I currently live in an area that has very poor internet connection. I can log in to iTunes but it would cost a fortune to download the updates to the OS. Is there a way I can have somebody bring the OS update on a thumb drive and load it from there?  <answer6379> When you plug in the iPod touch, kbdAlt/kbd- or kbdOption ⌥/kbd-click the device's "Restore" button in iTunes. This will allow you to choose the appropriate codeipsw/code file to load on the device.  Have someone download the appropriate firmware for your device.
