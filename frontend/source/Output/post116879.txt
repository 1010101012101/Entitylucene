How to create a bootable USB for Mac OS X Server 3.0.2? <body> I have the latest version of OS X Server (Version 3.0.2) downloaded of the App Store and basically I want to create a bootable USB for the installer.   However, looking at it, I'm not able to find the InstallESD.dmg and therefore I'm not sure how I can create a bootable image from this.  Does anyone know how to create a bootable for the latest server version of OS X Server?  <answer116880> Server.app is just a set of scripts and apps that run on top of the base OS X. So just follow the guides for 10.9 USB media.   So, I just carry a second USB drive with server.app and other downloads and use the first drive to install the OS, the second to outfit that image after it it running.   <comment136672> I tried doing that with by adding this in the terminal:  sudo /Applications/Server.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Server.app --nointeraction  But I'm left with the terminal saying command not found <comment136673> @user243318 Server app **is not** a bootable image. I'll try to edit my answer to make the second step clear. <comment136674> Ah thank you very much! I really appreciate it! :)
