Why can't an iPhone 6 and a mid-2011 MacBook Air see each other in AirDrop? <body> I'm trying to transfer photos, for example, from an iPhone 6 running iOS 8.1.3 to a MacBook Air, mid-2011, running OS X 10.10.2.   In either of these scenarios:  ul liiPhone set to be discoverable by Everyone/li liFinder open to AirDrop on the Mac/li liSelect a photo on iPhone, select Share, the Mac does not appear in the AirDrop pane/li /ul  or  ul liiPhone set to be discoverable by Everyone/li liPick a photo on the Mac, select Share, Airdrop, no devices appear in the Send via AirDrop dialog/li /ul  I have successfully used AirDrop from this Mac to other Macs in the past. Any idea why it isn't working with my iPhone? (I should point out that other features of Yosemite, such as receiving phone calls and SMS from the iPhone on the Mac, are functioning properly.)  <answer170162> Your mac (and mine too) is not compatible with airdrop between mac and iOSbr br strongSystem Requirements/strongbr To see if your Mac works with AirDrop, make sure youâ€™re in the Finder by clicking the desktop (the background area of your screen), or by clicking the Finder icon in the Dock.br Then, check to see if AirDrop is listed as an option in the Go menu.br If you don't see AirDrop listed, your Mac doesn't support this feature.br In order to transfer files between a Mac and and an iPhone, iPad or iPod touchbrbr  ul liyour iOS device needs to include a lightning connector/li liyour iOS device needs iOS 7 or later installed/li listrongyour Mac needs to be a 2012 or later model with OS X Yosemite installed/strong/li liYour Mac and iOS device both need bluetooth and Wi-Fi turned on.
