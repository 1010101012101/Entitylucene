How to get the smaller tabs back in Safari 6? <body> In Safari 6, tabs became very wide. I donâ€™t like this new behavior.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZT2Y.png" alt="screenshot"  Is there a way to get the old, smaller tabs back?  <answer57780> If you have SIMBL installed, download cosyTabs (Lion &amp; Mountain Lion) and your old-style tabs will be back. (Here'sa direct-download link.)  Open the zip and place the .bundle file in: code/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins//code  Works for me and SIMBL never gave me any trouble. On the website it says that it's only for Mountain Lion, but it works on my Lion Mac as well.  (source)   <answer57782> The glims tool - available from http://www.machangout.com - should do the trick to re-slice the tab width to something fixed if you prefer the old look.  <comment66470> Welcome to America - the land of wide. ;-) <comment66482> +1 just for the beautiful image <comment66513> I believe it's spelled SIMBL (without the E). <comment67504> dirty solution.....open a lot of empty tabs....thats what i do <comment68127> Oh yeah, I like the new design but it's *only good for touch devices* because the area to switch tabs is a lot bigger in most cases - people with big fingers would enjoy that in iOS. But in OSX this is annoying. We now have to *move the mouse cursor much further*...
