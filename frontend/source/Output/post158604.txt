Can I get the game center application back on my MacBook Air <body> The previous owner of my MacBook Air seems to have deleted my game center application. Is there any way I can get that back?  <answer158605> Try reinstalling OS X from the Recovery Partition. Turn off your computer, hold down Command and R while you turn it on again, and then go through the Reinstall OS X process. Apple Support has an article about it here.  <comment186514> You're using the same installed system as when a previous owner had it?!? Can we spell key-logger? NEVER use a second hand machine without wiping it first.
