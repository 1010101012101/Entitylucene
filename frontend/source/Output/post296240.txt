Finder stops responding to kbd shortcuts until I click View <body> I really depend on the keyboard shortcuts for cleaning up a finder folder like kbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbd1/kbd for clean up by name and kbdOption/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbd2/kbd for clean up by kind.  Frequently, though, I'll come to a folder that doesn't respond to each of these. I've found that I can 'wake it up' by strongsimply clicking (opening) the codeView/code menu/strong.   I can reproduce it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpXmrlOKSS0  <comment374157> Try clicking anywhere "inside" the folder; it may not be "in focus." <comment374306> Thanks @Allan but take a look at the screencast - it's in focus, and begins working when I click _outside_ the folder.
