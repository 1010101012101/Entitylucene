AES-IS support and processor architecture in 2010 iMacs <body> Which processor architecture was used in mid 2010 27'' iMacs? (iMac11,3 - EMC 2390)  The CPU is an Intel quad-core Core i5 CPU, 2.8 GHz.  I'm trying to find out if it supports the AES Instruction Set natively at the hardware level, because it would significantly speed up File Vault encryption.  So far I've found that it could either be Clarkdale or Lynnfield, but only the first one should come with hardware support for AES.  <answer243088> The 27" iMac from Mid-2010 (i5, 2.8Ghz) had an i5-760 inside.  The model is, in fact, a Lynnfield processor with quad cores.
