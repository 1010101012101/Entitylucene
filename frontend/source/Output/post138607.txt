Move full screen app to the LEFT of first desktop in 10.9.4? <body> I am part of the Apple developer program, and received the 10.9.3 beta before the full release.  In that version, I could place a full screen app to the LEFT of the first desktop. My setup was to have Mail in full screen on the left, Desktop 1 in the middle, and iTunes in full screen on the right. However, when 10.9.3 was released to the public, I updated to it and realised I could not use my setup anymore, as the first Desktop became immovable. I had hoped this was fixed in 10.9.4, but alas, it has not.  So, is there a Terminal command or preference switch to fix this?  If there is not, I guess my only hope is Yosemite...  Thanks in advance, xeni  NB. I am aware that there are apps like TotalSpaces that are able to do this, but it does not fully support the Magic Mouse, in that I cannot swipe with two fingers in between spaces, and the animations between spaces are extremely glitchy and often incorrect. (i.e. if i click a link in Mail, the animation will look like it came from iTunes, in my setup noted above.)  <comment163541> Do you have "Displays have separate Spaces" enabled in System Preferences - Mission Control? This will allow you to move a fullscreen app to the left of "Desktop 1". <comment163696> oh mate, you're a legend! Thank you. Now how come that isn't enabled by default, and what does that have to do with moving the first desktop around? Oh well, as long as it works :) <comment163715> That should be enabled by default in Mavericks. Odd that it wasn't. Disabling this setting enables Mountain Lion style spaces, where you couldn't move a full screen app to the left of the first desktop.
