How can I find dictation commands in French? <body> Apple has a list of dictation commands online here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6482 and here http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6481.  Does anyone know where I can find the French versions?  <answer159325> You can find the list of the default voice commands here: http://support.apple.com/fr-fr/HT6482  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f6OzE.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can find the list of the advanced voice commands here: System  Accessibility  Dictation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QSge.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MlxJo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment181350> do you have French OS X <comment181352> Did you download the French extended version? The software needed for each language you select downloads from Apple. <comment181447> I downloaded Enhanced Dictation for English (UK) and French (France).  I'm running OS X in English.  I've figured out a few of the commands, like "Switch to (app)" is "Basculer vers (app)".  I'd really like to see a complete list... <comment181482> only if someone here has a French OS X !
