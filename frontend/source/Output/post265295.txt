App name available only for one location? <body> What if App name I have chosen is available only for codeEnglish U.K./code but not for codeEnglish U.S/code?  When someone will search from US will not able to see that specific name?  I guess U.S. market is bigger, should I take app name always in U.S.?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rBsuN.png" alt="enter image description here"
