How to calculate max with condition in Numbers? <body> How can I calculate max with condition in Numbers?  In other words, I want something like codemaxifs/code, which operates max operation instead of sum operation for codesumifs/code.  <answer219904> Numbers version 3 on Mac and the equivalent web app/ios app do not have that level of abstraction, but on a Mac, Numbers is fairly scriptable in powerful ways.  I would probably dump the data into a SQLite database if your comment means you are familiar with that. This is documented at the wonderful OS X Automation site.  ul lihttps://iworkautomation.com/numbers/sqlite-make.html/li /ul  You could also program the logic you wanted in Applescript or possible the new javascript bridge for AppleScript on later OS X versions. Here is an example of complicated logic used to format cells. You could likely adapt that to process the data and then write the results to a new table.  ul lihttps://iworkautomation.com/numbers/examples-highlight-intersection.html/li /ul  It's not the same, but it would let you use numbers and not Excel for Mac.  <comment139428> The question is perfectly on-topic on AskDifferent. Any potential answerers shouldn't let themselves get confused by the SQL-like query above which as far as I understand only serves to illustrate the expected result. <comment139481> @patrix yes, you are correct, thank you for adding explanation. I used SQL only to explain expected result in other terms than the question itself. <comment240739> As Numbers does not support (yet) Array functions, this is a tricky one.  Even for [Excel](http://blog.contextures.com/archives/2013/11/19/using-max-if-with-multiple-criteria/).
