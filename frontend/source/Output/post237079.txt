Android File Transfer continuously fails to copy files to the SD card over USB in Android Lollipop <body> Android File Transfer fails to copy showing the following message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3tUKd.png" alt="could not copy the file error screenshot"  Another symptom is that the copy is not continuous. It freezes after copying a few megabytes during a couple of seconds.  I also have tried using AirDroid. It transfers data over WiFi instead USB. Google Chrome freezes after a few seconds even turning on "remote transfer" option to "always" in the AirDroid configuration  I also have tried SHAREit changing the path to receive files to the SD Card. It gets stuck without sending anything or giving any feedback.  I have Android Lollipop 5.0.1 on a Samsung Galaxy S4. The only options available are MTP and PTP (camera).  The question is: what is the problem? Why can't I copy the files?   <answer237220> Try using SmartFinder for Android. It's on the App Store and it's free. Make sure you have USB debugging enabled before using SmartFinder though.brbrbHow to enable USB debugging?/bbrGo to your smartphone's bSettings - About device - Tap on the Build number until you get a message "You are now a developer!"/bbrGo back to the main page of bSettings -Developer options - make sure USB debugging is ticked./bbrbrOnce you connect your phone for the first time, it'll install an app called bSmartFinder/b (about 4 MB) on your phone. It won't have an icon, no need to launch it.brbrThen, simply find the .mp3 file under bMusic/b in SmartFinder, select it and tap bImport/b.brbrIf that doesn't work, then the file might be corrupt.  <answer273326> I also faced same issue. I solved it by changing the file permission where i wanted the file to copy. Previously folder permission was read only, i change it to read and write.  <answer296286> The only thing that really helps with my Android device is rebooting it. After reboot I can copy files again... until it doesn't work any more and I have to reboot it again... AFT is a pain.  <comment290413> It seems simply corrupted... <comment290435> What exactly is the question? <comment290607> @patrix I have added the question. I wrongly though it was implicit in the explanation. The question is: what is the problem? Why can't I copy the files? <comment290609> It also get stucks when I tried to format it performing the long formatting way (I received the component to format it yesterday). I did it from VirtualBox with Windows as I did not find a proper way to format it well in OSX. I think corrupted. It just I got the last 3 memories corrupted, so it invites me to think maybe it is my problem! <comment290611> @chelder Yup. Probably corrupt. Do the files work on your phone? <comment290612> Around the first 8 Gb of files work well. The following files don't. The same in both SD cards. Now I'm trying this tool specific to format SD Cards: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/eula_mac/index.html <comment290613> @chelder If some files work, then it probably isn't the SD Card's problem, but the file's. <comment290768> Everything is copied without errors. Then: Â¡surprise! 10Gb are OK. The rest of the folders are simply empty. It seems a fraud of SD cards that seem 64GB but are actually 10GB.. <comment343619> Is it an ancient, slow SD card? When did you last format it, clean and new? SDFormatter: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/
