Mac Pro5,1 Hot Plug Internal Drive Bay <body> On Tuesday night I was tinkering in my Mac Pro 5,1 and I plugged in a hard drive into internal Bay 1 while the machine was sitting at the EFI drive picker menu (the menu you see when you hold down Option during boot).   That hard drive has a VM and macOS Server 5.2's data storage on it, among other things. Since Tuesday I've had some really weird behavior on the VM and I tried to migrate macOS Server service data off of the drive onto another drive and I got a weird non-zero exit code error.  The machine is starting to act weird in other ways.  But the problem is, I also applied the Sierra 10.12.1 update at the same time, so I'm wondering if this could be related to the software update or some other cause.  Would hot plugging the drive in an internal Mac Pro drive Bay fry the drive or the backplane or some other aspect of the system?  When running fsck on the drive from the recovery partition it seems fine. What other damage could have resulted from hot plugging the SATA drive?  Would the type of damage that might result from hot plugging a SATA drive manifest itself with intermittent errors of varying kinds?  If the machine were run for 10 minutes in a warm room with the cover off, would that cause an issue as well?  It occurs to me that the cooling system particularly of the CPU tray might rely on airflow over the large heat sinks to be guided by the closed case, so if the case were open it might cause the CPUs to overheat?
