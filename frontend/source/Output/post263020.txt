How to charge a laser pointer with my PC? <body> I bought a laser pointer, which pretends to support USB charging at this site. As soon as I attach the laser pointer I get a blue screen. Is the problem related to my system? I'm using a MacBook.   <comment329517> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because this site is for questions and answers in English <comment329520> L'Ã©cran bleu n'existe pas dans OS X!
