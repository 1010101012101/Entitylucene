Edits to recurring iCal events disappear <body> When I make a change to a recurring ical event, it reverts back to the original every time. Try again and again, same thing. Will not retain my edits to recurring events. This has been going on since Mavericks install. Anyone know how to fix or at least work around this issue?   I've seen this issue on multiple apple support forums and there is zero response from apple about it. I know there's someone out there who's figured it out. Please share your wisdom!  Thank you.
