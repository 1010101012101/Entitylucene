How can I modify a DVD image (ISO) and then burn a new DVD? <body> I have a (legit) copy of Star Wars Battlefront 1 for the Play Station 2 (PS2). There are game mods available (different character skins etc) that I'd like to try. Apparently this can be done but I'm tearing my hair out now...  I can make an image of the original DVD using Disk Utility. It creates a CDR file. When I burn that to a DVD-R (again, using Disk Utility), I can get the PS2 to load the game (using Swap Magic to load the DVD-R, this PS2 is not modded -- Swap Magic "soft mods" it to load burned DVDs).  precode$ file SWBF1.iso SWBF1.iso:                      UDF filesystem data (version 1.5) '1_01                           ' $ /code/pre  So having this much work all looks good but what I want to do now is modify some of the files before burning the DVD-R.  OSX won't let me edit the ISO (CDR) image. Apparently this is because ISO9660 is not really designed to allow modifications, so even using command line utilities (hdiutil) with -readwrite option won't allow me to modify the image.  So I suspect I need to extract the files onto the file system, add/modify the game data files for the game mod, then create a new ISO image and burn that? But this is not working -- I'm just creating coasters now. (The Mac can read the burned DVD but the PS2 doesn't recognise the disk as being valid). This for example, fails to give the desired result:  precode$ cd /path-to-extracted-files $ hdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name 1_01 -o SWBF1_mod.iso . $ hdiutil burn SWBF1_mod.iso  $ file ../*.iso ../SWBF1.iso:                      UDF filesystem data (version 1.5) '1_01                           ' ../SWBF1_mod.iso:                  data /code/pre  How can I modify files on a DVD ISO image to make this work?  Thanks  [Edit: I originally mentioned PS2 in the title but that's a red herring really. This problem seems to exist for anyone wanting to modify an ISO image on OS X. See for example this old discussion of the same problem.]  <answer94919> I know of two techniques to modify readonly disk images - using either a sparse image or a shadow file.  Here is what to do using a shadow file:  Create an image of your cdr (which you have already done)- I will call this xxx.cdr.  Use codehdiutil attach xxx.cdr -shadow/code which mounts the read-only codexxx.cdr/code image along with a shadow file where all changes will kept.  So it behaves like a mounted read/write image.  Make your changes.  Unmount the disk - you will now have xxx.cdr and xxx.cdr.shadow  Now run:  precodehdiutil convert -format UDTO -o newxxx.cdr xxx.cdr -shadow /code/pre  Then burn the codenewxxx.cdr/code to `DVD-R.  This is the method I have used to create a Snow Leopard image for use by Parallels or VMware. My posting in a MacRumors Thread is just part of a long discussion.    You may need to vary the above to suit your particular needs - I have no direct experience of working with PS2 images.  <comment111188> I should add that existing tutorials on how to do this are Windows only and involve software such as "Apache 1.1" and "ImgBurn" which are Windows only. I have Toast, Disk Utility and command line abilities. <comment111190> Nitpick, when I saw PS/2, I immediately thought of IBMs late desktop machine.  I think PS2 is the more common abbreviation for the game system. <comment111193> Thanks Alan - fixed. Probably was confusing :) <comment111320> Thanks Gilby. I've tried this but it refuses to mount read/write, although it does create a xxx.cdr.shadow file. But I can't modify any files on the mounted volume.
