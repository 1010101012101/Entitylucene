Remote volume control on iPad? <body> We have an iPad in office, which we use to play music when not being used for mobile app testing (etc.).   Is there a way to strongremote control volume from desktop/strong (OS X)?  <answer17389> Yup. http://download.cnet.com/Music-Remote-for-iPad-Remote-control-for-iPod-iPhone-and-iPad-Music/3000-2133_4-75177039.html.  <comment18956> Thank you, that looks interesting... Anything free? For OS X 10.5? :) <comment18957> I don't think that you will be able to find anything else that doesn't require Jailbreaking... I know that you can jailbreak and then use VLC to control your iPad. <comment18969> I see, thank you.
