podcast directory <body> all my podcasts used to download to Music\iTunes\iTunes Music\Podcasts.  after clean installing windows 7 and latest version of itunes, all podcast downloads are directed to Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Podcasts.  i don't want to have my podcasts in 2 different places, is there anything i can do to change directory to old location?  moving all my old files to this new location and then trying to get itunes to locate them all seems like a real hassle.  thanks.  <comment110801> iTunes for Mac has a “Consolidate files” option which moves all of your files to a single folder; instructions here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ph990 Does this do the trick for you?
