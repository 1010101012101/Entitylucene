OS X Maps app, seek with longitude and lattude possible? <body> Is there some way to get the Maps app in OS X Mavericks to show a specific known latitude/longitude expressed in numbers only? If so, what's the syntax?  <answer139475> It works for me with the following syntax:  precode51.10N,17.02E /code/pre  <comment164458> Thank you!  I'll remember that syntax. Unfortunately, the coordinates I had were in a number only form. I tried to convert these but failed. <comment164459> @MiB Can You show Your input?
