Any way to make Cmd-D "delete next word" rather than "split-pane" in Terminal <body> I am so used to using kbd⌘/kbdkbdD/kbd to "delete-next-word" in emacs and xterm, that I automatically hit it in Terminal all the time, which rather annoyingly (to me, at least) causes the pane to split instead. I've tried to google solutions, but all I get are hits telling me what a neat feature this is.  I could just use XTerm under X11, but Terminal plays more nicely with some of my favorite Mac utilities (notably Divvy). I've tried iTerm2, but at best I can get it to ignore kbd⌘/kbdkbdD/kbd, not actually erase the word.  Any ideas?  <answer28112> I don't know how to bind kbd⌘/kbdkbdD/kbd to codeM-d/code, but this would remove the shortcut of the Split Pane menu bar item:  precodedefaults write com.apple.Terminal NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Split Pane" nul /code/pre  <answer28947> You can get 'meta-' in terminal using either 'escape' as a prefix, or using opt/alt as a shift key.  I've not been able to find a way to use the command key, and none of my searches have turned up anything (with the exception of installing a key mapper); just the same complaint.  <answer32087> Switch to iTerm2. It's free and sooo much nicer than plain old terminal. Also it has a lot more options for customization, like keyboard shortcuts.  Also I love that you can use codecmd/code and 1-9 to switch between tabs. Try it and you will never go back to regular terminal :)  strongHow to set up delete next word in iTerm 2/strong  ol liInstall iTerm2/li liLaunch and then go to preference pane./li liChoose the "Keys" tab  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DmJFI.png" alt=""/li liClick on the plus button to add a new keyboard shortcut/li liIn the first box type CMD+D/li liIn the second box choose "Send Escape Sequence"/li liIn the third box type the letter d  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Km8Eu.png" alt=""/li /ol  Voila!
