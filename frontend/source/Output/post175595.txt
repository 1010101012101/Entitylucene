Is there anyway to turn off the dreaded slot machine date picker in iOS? <body> The date picker in iOS is awful.  Every time I put something on my calendar it's a "game of chance" if I will notified about it.  Combine that with a touch screen and you have a recipe for scheduling disaster.     I would prefer to select a date from a calendar, or heaven-forbid, type it in using the keyboard!!!!!  Is there any way to turn this thing off?  <answer175598> Simple answer: Nope.  Sorry to disappoint you. I also dislike this new picker. It is found all over the new UI and it is just terrible. Whoever decided this was good design missed the boat.  <comment207106> Oh good I thought I was the only one who thought this particular part of the UX sucked!!! <comment207108> There is nothing that says you have to use the built in calendar app. There are many alternatives. I use Calendars 5 which allows natural language appointment entry. <comment207109> I totally agree with @Mark. While I don't use the calendar that much and haven't gone looking for other apps, there are plenty of calendar apps available. I'd pull up the store and download a pile of apps and see which works for you. I've heard good things about Sunrise. <comment207214> Could you (someone) upload a picture of this dreaded date picker? What does "turn this think off" mean in practice? <comment207216> It means replace it with a simple text box. <comment207306> Solution: buy an android. There's nothing about android that can't be customized :-) <comment207442> @Mark Using another calendar app is not sufficient as the standard date picker control gets used in all other apps e.g. timers <comment207446> I set appointments in calendars 5 all the time and never see the date picker.
