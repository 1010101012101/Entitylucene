Why has AirPlay to Apple TV stopped working from 3rd-party apps? <body> I have been using AirPlay to stream stuff to my Apple TV for months, and it's been great. In the last week or so it stopped working for 3rd-party apps.  ul liI use Radium on my Mac. This used to work fine but now when I unmute Apple TV it mutes itself again as soon as it starts to play./li liI use the Digitally Imported app on my iPhone. I used to be able to stream this to Apple TV but now when I choose it it stops playing./li /ul  In both cases Apple TV shows up as a potential output device, and disappears and reappears as it should when I switch AirPlay off and on again on my Apple TV. I've tried 2 different routers and both wired and wireless connections. There is nothing relevant in the Console logs on my Mac that I can see.  The odd thing is that iTunes on my Mac can still play to it, and AirPlay mirroring works fine too, so it does seem to only affect 3rd-party applications.  How do I fix this?  <answer66489> The recent 5.1 software update to Apple TV seems to have fixed it.  <comment78577> To tell you the truth, I am having the same issue. I am not sure if it came with the last Mountain Lion update. It was working the other day. listening to music on Saturday 22/09/12. Then video on TV and music on the mac. Selected audio settings . did so on advice of a website. every time i select my AppleTV it keeps bouncing off - unselectable. upgraded the Apple Tv but that did not help. <comment78578> Thanks.  Strangely enough that is all I had.  It just stopped working.  So I restarted the laptop in a Windows fixing sort of style and lo and behold, the Airplay is back and allowing audio to the TV.  Fixed. <comment78579> Restarting everything didn't help me.
