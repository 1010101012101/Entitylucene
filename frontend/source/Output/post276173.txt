Reconnect to Wi-Fi when "Wi-Fi does not have an IP address" <body> I came into the office today with my MacBook Pro and usually my Wi-Fi automatically connects to the network, but instead it is constantly searching.   If I go to System Preferences  Network  Wi-Fi, there is a solid yellow circle and the text reads "Wi-Fi does not have an IP address and cannot connect to the Internet".   I've tried turning off Wi-Fi and restarting the computer but neither has worked.  <answer276174> In the Network Preferences, click "Advanced ..." and remove the WiFi network from the 'Preferred Networks'. This will make macOS forget the network, after which you can attempt to connect again. macOS will build up the connection 'from scratch' and won't rely on any cached settings. I have to use the same trick once in a while for our corporate WiFi network.  <answer278873> If toggle Wi-Fi Power and removing preferred Network doesn't work then try "Renew DHCP lease".  After the connection.  ol liGoto System Preference - Network - Select Wi-Fi - Advanced - TCP/IP/li liClick on "Renew DHCP lease" and apply./li /ol  It works sometime.   If this also not works you can try with valid Static IP (add DNS also, manually)  <comment347517> Did not seem to work for me, I did manage to get onto another network that we have in the office, but the original one did not work. <comment347518> Is there not anyone in your office responsible for maintaining the computers and network that you can have look at your issue? <comment347661> @user3439894 There is, I wanted to see if I could solve the problem myself first.
