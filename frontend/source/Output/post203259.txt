What happens to subscriptions when an app is deleted from the app store? <body> My organization is planning on sunsetting a number of apps in favor of one newer and improved container app. Once we delete an app from the app store, I understand that it will continue to exist on the devices to which it's been downloaded. However, within the app, you can purchase a subscription for additional content, and my question is what happens to those subscriptions once the app is removed from the store. Will they stay active, or do the active subscriptions get cancelled when it is removed from the app store?
