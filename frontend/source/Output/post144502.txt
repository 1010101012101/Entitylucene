Incorrect name keeps appearing in Mail.app account info <body> I changed my name in iCloud a while ago, and then reverted that change. iCloud.com, the iCloud System Preference pane, and the info that appears in the Internet Accounts entry for the iCloud account are all correct. In Mail.app, it keeps sending emails as the previous name.  In ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/Accounts.plist it shows the old name in Root - MailAccounts - Item 3 - FullUserName, as well as both the EmailAlias entries. I can change these to the correct name in the plist and start Mail.app again, and it will revert these values back again.  I can't find anywhere where my previous name is specified.  <answer178572> From http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/display/mitcontrib/Apple+Mail+shows+incorrect+name+for+email+address:     h3Question(s)/h3      How come Apple Mail shows the wrong name when I type my email address in the To or CC field?      h3Context/h3      AppleMailbr   Apple Mailbr   Mail.appbr   Address Book      The name that shows up in the TO: or CC: field when typing an email address is incorrect.br   (Ex.

If there is a card with the email address typed, it will try to use the name on that card. This can be changed by:      ul   liOpen the address book/li   liSearch for the email address/li   liClick Edit/li   liClick the name in the card to change it./li   liClick Edit again to stop editing/li   /ul      Test by trying to create a new message to the email address in question.   <comment170650> Have recently setup iCloud on a new MBP and the incorrect name comes up there as well. <comment211507> There are lots of separate places on iCloud.com where you set your account name, the important one for this is within the Mail Preferences itself. Is it correct there? http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/177883/112471 <comment214577> Hi, unfortunately I can't find anything wrong for the given email in the address book. (contact.app)
