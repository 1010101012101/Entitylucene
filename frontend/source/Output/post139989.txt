How do I AirPlay mirror my iPhone screen to my MacBook Pro? <body> I am using a 13 inch Retina MacBook Pro with Mavericks and a iPhone 5s with iOS 7.  I want to record game tutorials. Where the game is running on my iOS device and I'm recording the tutorial via a screen capture of an AirPlay on my MacBook Pro.  After searching apps from the App Store, I found that there is no apps to record your screen and the only way is through AirPlay on your Mac or Apple TV.   Is there any strongfree/strong and legal way to do do?  I have tried a trial of X mirage and it is just what I wanted, but it cost money. I want to record my iPhone.   Note that I do not have any other apple devices.  <answer140014> An app which works great for me is Reflector. Its not free, but there is an unrestricted 7-day trial for you to experiment with. You can use the free Quicktime Player on your Mac to record a video of the screen (or a selected portion thereof) of the iDevice, once Reflector is displaying it on the screen.  I use this combination all the time.  <answer140075> You can do as others have suggested and download another piece of (paid) software for your Mac, or simply hang tight until iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite come out, at which point (assuming Apple maintains the feature) the QuickTime Screen Recording function will work on an iOS 8 device connected to the computer via USB.  In addition, a service called iRec should allow you to do what you want (without the use of a computer) once it is released later this year.   <answer140087> The easiest way is to Airserver, which is an app that turns your Mac into an Airplay receiver. See airserver.com It is not free, but for $15 you can solve the problem. I use it all the time to either display my iPad or iPhone on a beamer connected to my Mac and use screen recording software to record tutorials.  <answer159493> If your devices have OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 or anything newer, there's a built-in way to do this via a wired connection.  ol liConnect your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch to your Mac via a Lightning Cable./li liOpen QuickTime on your Mac, and select strongFile/strong  strongNew Movie Recording/strong./li liA recording window will appear.

Here is the link to a tutorial: http://www.labnol.org/software/quicktime-ios-screen-recorder/8375/  This way you don't need reflector and the quality is even better.  <answer187341> Use QuickTime Player (which is pre-installed on OS X)  <answer194278> Use Shou screen recorder, no need jailbreak, download from https://shou.tv/ios  <answer219671> ol liDownload and install iTools Pro on your Mac./li liConnect your Mac and iPhone to same network./li liClick on Airplayer button from iTools's windows./li liWait for Airplayer to be downloaded./li liConnect to Airplayer through Airplay from your iPhone.

And after a quick Google Search, I couldn't find 'X marige', typo? <comment164953> Thanks.

We've been trying to find a free app, but we've had no luck. <comment191756> URL is broken.but I got the idea of use QuickTime for recording. <comment191758> @RafaelGorski Thanks for pointing it out! I just changed it to a link that looks pretty non-broken. <comment206035> But apple should make this available over the air. <comment265669> Please see the help center regarding [self-promotion](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) and make sure you disclose if you are affiliated with a product. <comment265720> I'm not doing promotion or I'm not affiliated with that company. And I'm not giving any affiliated link to the website. This is the answer what they are looking for. <comment274130> If all you want to do is play, I found you can skip steps 4 and 5. Thanks so much for pointing out this great feature of Quicktime "Player".  :) <comment274870> Just keep in mind it doesnt work if you are in a phone call :( <comment350117> It also interrupts any Xcode debugging sessions. <comment369355> Its not workiing for Hotstar and amazon prime videos. <comment369360> @AbhishekMitra That makes sense, apps can probably avoid being recorded, similar to how Mac screen recordings won't show iTunes video. <comment369365> @user24601 so, is there anyway to add those app videos, its not working on youtube either ..!
