Couldn't open device <body> I can not partition nor use a removable USB disk without file system.

Thanks (I'm using emMac OS X 10.11.3/em)  <answer227860> Restore a DMG (maybe an OSX InstallESD.dmg or any other application) to the disk/drive via Disk Util. This will overwrite it (deleting all data). Then you can partition again how you like.  I have encountered this several times myself with USB pen drives as well as SSDs inside a MacBook Air. Formatting and Erasing brought up the exact same errors you describe. DD didn't work out, Resizing the partition gave me an error about corruption on the disk. First Aid/Scanning &amp; Repairing the volume didn't yield any results, the tool completed with the message that there wasn't anything to repair.  Only the Restoring of a random DMG to the drives made it manageable again.  Hope this helps!  <comment272578> How (which application, which commands) are you actually trying to format the disk? <comment272588> Question updated with the commands I tried. <comment272600> You could try erasing the first few sectors of the device: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=1m count=16` (you might have to disconnect and reconnect the device after that). <comment272605> I got this reply:  `16+0 records in  16+0 records out 16777216 bytes transferred in 18.323810 secs (915596 bytes/sec)` But nothing changes, then I always get the same errore. <comment272611> Does `sudo gpt show -l /dev/disk2` yield anything? <comment272615> `start=0 size=15613920  index=  contents= ` <comment272621> Well that is odd... could you try `sudo gpt destroy /dev/disk2`? <comment272647> No luck: `gpt destroy: /dev/disk2: error: device doesn't contain a GPT` . The USB drive seems completely unpartitioned! <comment272664> Made some progress here: I used [gdisk](http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/) to create a new partition on the disk, and it worked. The Mac still does not recognise it. Now I'm trying `diskutil erase` , but I get `Could not mount disk3s2 with name NAME after erase` <comment272670> I stil does not have any file system, but it now has a `GUID_partition_scheme` . I tried creating a file system with `disktuil eraseVolume`, but I can not unmount it, not even with `unmountDisk force` . <comment325965> marco2012 did you get any solution for this?
