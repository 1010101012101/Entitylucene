How do I add a featured iTunes Radio station to my stations on iOS? <body> On iTunes for Mac I can right click a station to add it my stations. I tried a long press on a featured station on iOS but that doesn't bring up any options.  <answer102692> According an Apple support doc:     You can add a featured station to My Stations by tapping the Info (i)   button, then tapping the Plus (+) button to the right of "Add to My   Stations."
