MacBook Pro 15'' Retina Mid-2015: Upgrade RAM to 32Gb <body> Is this possible?  I read on the crucial.com website that it is not.  I imagine 2x16Gb would be a bit expensive but not unheard of.  <answer247526> It's not that the amount of RAM doesn't exist, it's that the upgradeability doesn't exist. The Retina MacBook Pro's RAM is soldered to the motherboard. Nothing is getting in or out.  <comment305451> Make sense then... <comment308215> additionally, the Haswell processor and chipset in that computer only support a maximum of 16GB of RAM (and it is soldered onto the board, so it's moot anyway).
