Why is Finder hanging/beachballing after a Quick Look window is closed? <body> I select a file, hit Space for Quick Look, and then hit Space again to hide the window. Finder hangs and in some cases beachballs for a while before becoming responsive again.  Other notes:  ul liIt gets worse over time. If I restart Finder the hang time is nonexistant. The more I use QuickLook, the slower it is. The hang is ~3 seconds after using (opening and closing) QuickLook 10 times. It only gets worse from there./li liActually showing the file is always instantaneous in all cases/li liBoth /Library/QuickLook and ~/Library/QuickLook are empty./li liThis is a Mid 2012 MacBook Air running 10.8.2 with all the software updates./li liRestarting the entire machine doesn't help any more than restarting Finder./li listrongUpdate:/strong Other users on this machine don't experience this problem./li /ul  Any ideas?  <comment94423> Have you tried resetting the Quick Look cache with `qlmanage -r`? <comment94590> Just ran `qlmanage -r` and `qlmanage -r cache`. No effect. Restarted Finder. Same problem.
