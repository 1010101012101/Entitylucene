Unable to create new partition with Disk Utility on external drive <body> I'm trying to create space on an external drive to clone my mac as a bootable volume with CCC. With Disk Utility I cannot modify it for some reason (probably because the same disk is used with Time Machine, I don't know, never happened before) So on a seperate machine with linux I used Gparted to resize the disk for the additional partition, but gparted cannot create HFS+ volumes.   I tried the terminal command      newfs_hfs -v CCC /dev/rdisk1s5   but this also failed. Any new suggestions for a next step are welcome.  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vgddm42.png" alt="Disk Utility says something about CoreStorage:"  <comment127432> I would have to guess that the message about the disk not being modifiable because it contains CoreStorage physical volumes may be a clue to why you can't modify it. <comment127434> @IconDaemon true, except I have no idea what CoreStorage physical volumes are <comment127459> From the contents of the tag "CoreStorage" in AskDifferent: "Apple Core Storage (sometimes referred to as coreStorage or CoreStorage) maintains a world of virtual disks that can provide the user with flexibility in allocating their hardware." CoreStorage is used primarily in OS X to create the FusionDrive - a hybrid of separate SSD and spinning HDs. To OS X it looks like one volume combining the storage of both drives, sort of like a RAID0 set, but with the OS actively placing frequently accessed files on the SSD, whilst removing infrequently accessed files to the spinning disk. <comment130071> The Core Storage physical volume is the spinning hard drive half of the hybrid SSD/HD FusionDrive. For some reason yet to be determined, this external drive has been flagged as being one of these drives. Perhaps the linux utility you ran to partition the device did this. I'd start from scratch by transferring your TM backup to another external HD, reformatting & repartitioning this odd disk, then moving back the TM backup.
