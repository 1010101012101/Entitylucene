Uptime report multiple users <body> I'm not sure I understand the command "uptime"  uptime 13:58  up 5 days,  9:49, 3 users  I have 3 users detected, but I have only one user account on the Mac and no sharing enabled.  What the users actually are?  <answer273297> The 'who' command lists logged-in users. You will probably find that they are multiple copies of yourself; one for each terminal window and one for the "console" session.  <answer273298> Close Terminal.app, then open one Terminal.app window and read the manual pages for codeuptime/code, codew/code and codewho/code, e.g codeman uptime/code, then execute each command e.g. codeuptime/code, codew/code and codewho/codein that order in that one Terminal.app window you opened.  It should become apparent however if not... There are always at least two users logged in, emyou/em using codeconsole/code and note its time, it's corresponds to the time you logged into your account from the GUI, and emyou/em using codettys000/code (the Terminal.app windows that you opened). In these instances emyou/em is as shown in the output of codewho am i/code.  Each additional Terminal window you open will show as another emuser/em using , e.g. codettys001/code, codettys002/code, etc.  <comment343536> Do you have Terminal open, with several tabs maybe?
