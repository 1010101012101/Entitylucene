PayPal with Siri works only sometimes <body> So PayPal has the Siri control support according to the (German) AppStore.   If my Siri language is on English it works (but I have to correct the text all the time because my English is to bad for Siri).  In my native language however (German) it just says that PayPal doesn't support Siri control.  But I was able once to send money with my native language Siri.  Can someone tell me why it is not working?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1VulL.png" alt="Siri can&#39;t help me"  iPhone SE on iOS 10.3.2  Translation of the screenshot:     "Send one cent to **** **** on PayPal"      I really would like to help you but PayPal has not configured for the usage with Siri yet.
