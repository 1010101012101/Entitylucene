How do I prevent TGZ archives from being automatically un-gzipped upon download? <body> I use Safari on Mac OS Lion, and one behavior I find rather annoying is that it insists on automatically un-gzipping TGZ archives when I download them. It doesn't emuntar/em them; it just uncompresses them, which is virtually useless. Ideally, it wouldn't uncompress them at all, but if it would uncompress and untar them I could live with that.  I'm aware that I can uncheck the "Open 'safe' files after downloading" option in Safari to false, but that also means giving up such niceties as PDFs automatically opening when I download them. Is there a more tailored solution?  <answer62003> You can create a file that overrides OS X's safe file types. Instructions here. Keep in mind that this is a white list, so you'll have to add the identifiers for file types you emdo/em want Safari to automatically open.  emNote: these instructions are a bit old, and I can't confirm if this is still the case with Lion and Safari 6 (only on an iPad at the moment), but its worth a try/em.  <answer128536> Uncheck the, "Open "safe" files after downloading" checkbox in Safari's General preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRBF4.png" alt="Safari Preferences"  <comment71673> PDFs typically open in the browser, regardless of that setting.
