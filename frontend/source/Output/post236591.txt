Does the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter passthrough HDCP? <body> I have a dual-link (2560x1440) DVI monitor connected to my computer (2015 retina MbP) through the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter. It is reported as not HDCP-complient by iTunes and Netflix. Is this because the monitor doesn't support HDCP, or because the adapter doesn't pass the HDCP?  <answer236594> Here's what Apple says about this:      Apple Mini DisplayPort adapters that offer digital connections—such as   the Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI adapter and the Apple Mini   DisplayPort to DVI adapter—strongsupport HDCP content/strong. Apple Mini   DisplayPort adapters that offer analog connections—such as the Apple   Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter—do not support HDCP content.   Also, I found this answer on an Apple site but I can't verify if it's correct so YMMV:     Here is what I found a) Mini DP to DP will offer full resolution 2560   X 1080 @ 60 Hz but HDCP content from iTunes is not permitted, ie. will   not run; b) HDMI adapter to DVI-D allows HDCP content to run but the   resolution is limited to 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz; c) HDMI to HDMI also does   not offer full resolution but allows access to HDCP content; finally,   the only configuration that offers both full resolution and HDCP is   with Mini Display Port to Dual DVI-D cables.
