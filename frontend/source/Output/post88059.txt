Time machine error-1 <body> How can I solve the problem - The backup disk image “/Volumes/Time Capsule de xx/MacBook Pro xx.sparsebundle” could not be accessed (error -1).  <answer94535> In Time Capsule go to "Disk" then "File Sharing".  Make sure "Share disk over the internet using Bonjour" is not checked. Don't know why but it caused this problem for me.  <comment103092> Welcome.
