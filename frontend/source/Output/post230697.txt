Create .icns ad hoc <body> I want to create code.icns/code for an app i made, i know how to make icons in png and code.ico/code but i don't  know much about it.  Which size should i create my icons before to convert them? I don't want my icons to look sharpen or blurred.  I tried just converting them but i don't know if it's just a matter of converting png or ico...  Any advice appreciated!  <answer230701> There's really no point in shoving a low resolution icon into the high resolution icns format. You'll likely need to modify your scaling and make much larger images and then use a tool to assemble the file.  Have a pretty in depth read of the OS X guidelines and the iOS guidelines (which are more complicated, but a shorter read):  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Optimizing/Optimizing.html/li lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1686/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40009882/li /ul  It's quite a bit of detail on high resolution packing - so you'll likely need a few hours or days depending on how long you've been making resources.   In addition to letting Xcode make your icns resource and the codeiconutil/code command line tool, look into tiff2icns  <answer230796> In addition to @bmike 's answer earlier, here's an AppleScript that automates the process of .icns creation.  precodeset export_folder to choose folder with prompt "Please select export folder." set isImage to false repeat while isImage = false     set import_image to choose file with prompt "Please select image to covert."     try         tell application "Image Events"             launch             set test_image to open import_image             if resolution of test_image = {} or resolution of test_image = {0, 0} then                 error ["Invalid Image"]             end if             set isImage to true         end tell     on error         tell application "System Events"             display dialog "Error: Selected file is invalid" with title "Error" with icon caution         end tell     end try end repeat   try     tell application "Finder"         make new folder at export_folder with properties {name:"Icon.iconset"}     end tell on error     tell application "System Events"         display dialog "Error: Folder \"Icon.iconset\" already exists, will overwrite unless canceled" with title "Error" with icon caution     end tell end try  set export_folder_path to POSIX path of export_folder set import_image_path to POSIX path of import_image set icon_folder_path to POSIX path of export_folder_path &amp; "/Icon.iconset"  do shell script "sips -z 16 16     " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_16x16.png" do shell script "sips -z 32 32     " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_16x16@2x.png" do shell script "sips -z 32 32     " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_32x32.png" do shell script "sips -z 64 64     " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_32x32@2x.png" do shell script "sips -z 128 128   " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_128x128.png" do shell script "sips -z 256 256   " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_128x128@2x.png" do shell script "sips -z 256 256   " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_256x256.png" do shell script "sips -z 512 512   " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_256x256@2x.png" do shell script "sips -z 512 512   " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " --out " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_512x512.png" do shell script "cp " &amp; import_image_path &amp; " " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; "/icon_512x512@2x.png" do shell script "iconutil -c icns " &amp; icon_folder_path &amp; ";"  display notification "ICNS Creator has finished generating an ICNS" with title "ICNS Creator" /code/pre  <comment281604> In addition, I've written an AppleScript to take in an image and turn it into a .icns: I'd be happy to post it if anyone'd like. <comment281631> Please do @JMY1000 - edit in or answer here or post a new "jeopardy" question. Ping me and link if it's elsewhere :-) <comment281643> I have used the online tool at [this site](https://iconverticons.com/online/) to create icns files. I am not sure it will help, but I though I would mention the site. <comment281656> @bmike Thank you for the tips, of course, i am not using low resolutions images, i do all by svg so the only important thing for me is to know which sizes i should export the svg to png. Is it `48, 32, 16, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 wide images` ? <comment281657> @DavidAnderson which sizes do you used for the original icon? To not to loose resolution while converting them i mean. <comment281698> I added a second link for iOS considerations. Apple requirements explanations for naming list these px sizes (duplicates are intentional) 512, 1024, 120, 180, 76, 152, 40, 80, 120, 29, 58, and 87 - see Table 5. Table 6 adds more mandatory and optional sizes for apps provisioned for iOS 6.1 and earlier, @sbaaaang <comment281756> @bmike Thank you a lot man! <comment281778> @bmike Added :) <comment281954> many thanks, will try it !
