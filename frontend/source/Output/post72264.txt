iOS 6 - does it save my location? <body> I recently found out that the iPhone keeps (at least on older versions) your location data in a data file:  http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/#faq  I have an iPhone on iOS 6 but my consolidated.db doesn't have the CellLocation table. The only table that has Lat / Lon information is Fences, but it's empty.  Has Apple fixed the security hole and stopped recording the data?  UPDATE  I found this article saying that Apple promised to keep the data for a shorter time:  http://www.yourdailymac.net/2011/04/apple-the-iphone-is-not-logging-your-location/  I'd like something more certain about which iOS versions are affected.  <answer72268> Ok, I think I found the answer. It was fixed in 4.3.3. Data is only saved for a week, along with other safeguards.  http://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-to-shortly-release-iOS-4.3.3-update-deals-with-location-tracking-bug_id18571
