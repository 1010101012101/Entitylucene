Why does Safari always hang? <body> I use Safari as my browser, but I've found that it frequently hangs for 20, 30 seconds (sometimes longer), often times when I wake it up from sleep and/or when I open a new tab.  Though I'm not sure it would be helpful, the next time it does it I'll see if I can sample the process and report back with the results. In the meantime, is there something I can try? I'm running on a mid-2007 MacBook so, while I think I have enough processing power (2x2.16Ghz) and memory (2GB), I suspect it's a disk issue.  Is there something I can do to reduce disk usage? Should I clear my cache (this isn't a problem), my history (I want to keep this if possible) or both?  strongedit:/strong Is there any way to determine what plugins I have installed? I have RescueTime and Evernote, so either of them could be the culprit, but I know that there are programs that like to install hidden extensions, so that could be the problem as well.

Try installing ClickToFlash and see if that helps things.  <answer5333> Did you update to Safari 4.0.3 yet?  I was having problems with 4.0.2  <answer13355> Go to codeJava Preferences/code - codeDisable java-SE/code  Then try to open webpage in Safari again.  <comment5449> You can type about:plugins in the Safari address bar to get a list of installed browser plugins. <comment5450> @arathorn: I just get a blank page when I try to visit about:plugins. You sure that works for Safari? <comment5451> @Kyle Cronin: Whoops, my mistake. You actually just to to the *Help* menu and select *Installed Plug-ins*. <comment5452> Thanks for the tip - I've actually had CTF installed for a while. Could it be another plugin perhaps? <comment5453> It seems to be better, but I don't know if that was the update or the restart that did it. I'm going to accept this answer unless Safari starts acting up again. <comment14117> if you send me the whole stacktrace I can give you a more accurate idea of where is Safari blowing.
