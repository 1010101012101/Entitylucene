Menu bar icons disappearing when connecting USB device <body> If I plug something into one of the USB ports on my Mac 17â€³ (after upgrading to Yosemite) my Menu Bar at the top of the desktop keeps disappearing and reappearing. The icons keep flashing on and off.  This only happens when I plug something into a USB port.  It's very annoying and frustrating as my Mac now fails to fully recognise my iPhone and I am unable to sync it to my iTunes and my graphics tablet is acting weird too.  Yosemite has not been a success with me yet, it just seems to be one thing going wrong after another! Is anyone else having this issue?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iaPEh.jpg" alt="Menu Bar"  <comment190661> Please be more specific about the model # of the iMac. You can use this handy chart to figure it out: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201634 . Does this happen with any USB port and any type of USB device? What kinds of USB device are you using? You don't indicate if this happens when the Keyboard & mouse are plugged in. If it doesn't happen with these devices, does the menu bar disappear when you plug a device into the USB port on the keyboard? <comment212755> The menu bar icons are presented by the "SystemUIServer" process. Due to the fact that those icons are disappearing, the `SystemUIServer` process is likely crashing. You might be able to find a crash log at `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports` that has the name `SystemUIServer` in it somewhere. Those crash logs will likely provide helpful information on why the process is crashing. I'd be suspicious of the disk/wiper icon (some "cleaning" utility?) that isn't disappearing with the rest (it's normal for Spotlight to stay in the menubar when `SystemUIServer` is not running).
