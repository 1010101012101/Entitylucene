Make Caps Lock behave like in Windows <body> I use VoIP programs, and I use Caps Lock for Push-To-Talk (PTT) on those. The problem I experience is that when I push Caps Lock, I toggle the Push-To-Talk, which means that if I release Caps Lock, PTT is still on, and I have to push the button again to stop PTT. While on Windows this works fine, I have to hold down Caps Lock to talk. Any idea how I can make it so that I need to hold down Caps Lock on OSX as well?  <answer196546> I used Seil (OSX app to manipulate caps lock) to rebind Caps Lock to F13, and I bound F13 to PTT, so now it works.  <comment234777> What is Seil? A link would be helpful (and prevent others from having to google it themselves). <comment234828> Sounds like a Problem with your Voip-client.
