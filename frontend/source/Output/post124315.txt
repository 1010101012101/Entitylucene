Keychain Access not revealing passwords <body> I was able to fix the problem by restarting my computer, but I wanted to see if anyone else had this issue.   If I right click on a keychain item and select "Copy Password to Clipboard" the usual password confirmation dialog box didn't come up and the password isn't copied.  If I press kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdi/kbd and check the "Show Password" box, the confirmation dialog box does not show up and the check disappears after a fraction of a second.   I also tried locking the login keychain thinking that maybe if I locked and unlocked it the behavior would be fixed. But clicking the lock in the top left corner does nothing.  Like I said, restarting fixed the issue.  hr / strongEdit:/strong  So this is happening again about a month later.   I opened console and there is nothing logged under "All Messages" when I click the "Show Password:" checkbox.  When trying to copy an application password rather than a web form I get: "Access to this item is restricted (-25320)"  Keychain first aid says there is nothing wrong with the keychain.   <comment145395> Does the problem recur? <comment145408> Not since restarting. <comment149700> Well, I'm going to restart again because I need to use my computer. Maybe next time it happens someone will be able to help. <comment150112> I have a similar situation, but I made one observation: Passwords that I set several months ago are working properly. Passwords that I set only recently will not show. For web passwords it is possible to reveal them in Safari, but with mail passwords it appears to be impossible. <comment256851> Have kind of a similar situation, a bit more details â€” http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/212622/keychain-wont-let-copy-passwords-after-10-11-1-update
