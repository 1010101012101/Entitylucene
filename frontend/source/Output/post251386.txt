Selecting a radio button on a drop down menu <body> I'm trying to select a radio button on a drop down menu, but can't seem to find it! I'm super new at this and logic brought me up to here:  precodetell application "Calendar"     activate end tell tell application "System Events"     tell process "Calendar"         tell menu bar 1             tell menu bar item "Calendar"                 tell menu "Calendar"                     click menu item "add account..."                     delay 1                     click radio button "other caldav account..." of sheet 1 of window 1                 end tell             end tell         end tell     end tell end tell /code/pre  <comment312510> I think you can select a choice from radio buttons *or* make a selection from a dropdown menu. I don't think you can select a radio button from a dropdown. But I could be wrong!
