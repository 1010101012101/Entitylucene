File permissions after migration to MacBook Air OSX 10.11.4 <body> Sharing and Permissions  I have migrated from a MacBook (OSX 10.7) to the Air.  Access to many of my files is now difficult and denied.  I open up Sharing and Permissions to find: "You have custom access" followed by fetching (R/W), staff (read only), everyone (read only).  I have to open up the file lock, put in my id to give me access.  I usually add myself as a user and that seems to work.  But there are hundreds of files like this.  Two questions:  ol liIs there a bulk change that can be applied?/li liWhat is "fetching"?/li /ol  <comment291921> How did you migrate your data from the old computer to the Air? Also, could you add a screenshot of the Sharing/Permissions window for a sample file?
