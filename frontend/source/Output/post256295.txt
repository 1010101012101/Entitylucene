Apple Photos App Stuck For Days "Closing the library..." <body> I recently migrated my library from iPhoto to the Apple Photos app. There's probably around 13,000 photos/videos in the library. After migrating the library, I closed Photos, and it is now been stuck "Closing the library..." for two days.  I checked the activity monitor shortly after it appeared to be stuck and there were seemingly related processes consuming high amounts of CPU resources, such as codecom.apple.photos.VideoConversionService/code and codephotoanalysisd/code. So I waited, assuming those processes are preventing the app exit and just need to finish what they are working on.  It is now day 2 and I still see Photos is "Closing the library..." and the processes are still live, but aren't consuming any CPU any longer.  Other forums/sites talk about the "Closing the library..." issue and suggest just force quitting Photos. However, I don't want to do this if there any risk on corrupting the library, or killing a process that needs to complete to make the library complete.  Any suggestions on what I should do next?  <comment333103> It's been a couple of months now.  Are you still waiting?  Did you follow the suggestion to forcibly quit Photos? <comment333140> I ended up force closing the library and starting computer. Hard to tell what damage (if any) was done. <comment333385> Yes, I wonder if there is a way to do some kind of integrity check on the library.  Have you had the same thing happen again since October?
