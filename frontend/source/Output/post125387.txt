Shortcut for PDF preview in Word <body> Is there any way to setup a shortcut to generate a PDF preview of a word document?  <comment146741> From within Word? Or in Finder? And what is a PDF preview for you, compared to a PDF document? <comment146799> How do you generate a PDF preview even without a shortcut? <comment146803> In Word's print settings, there is an option to generate a PDF preview: Print- Open PDF in preview. I am wondering if there is a shortcut for this to quickly check how a document looks without saving it first.
