Constant kernel GPU panics (GPUPanic.cpp:127) on mid-2010 MacBook Pro (6,2) <body> Hardware is a mid 2010 MAcBook Pro 15", i7 2,66ghz, 8 GB RAM, 512 MB Video RAM.  I encounter regular kernel panics for a while now, I think since upgrading to Mavericks. Usually it used to happen every now and then, between once a week and once a month. So I did not really worry in the beginning. As it started getting on my nerves and neither volume repair nor hard ware test did indicate anything wrong, I decided to do a clean install of the latest Mavericks version a few days ago to see if that helps. kernel panics are still there and with the update to 10.9.3. today it seems even worse. I already had two kernel panics today, which make it four this week.  Attached is the latest kernel panic log:  precodeAnonymous UUID:       2BA5E44A-7200-45C0-F925-7A3107857DDC  Fri May 16 14:19:00 2014 panic(cpu 3 caller 0xffffff7f8b041f7c): "GPU Panic: [&lt;None&gt;]

idea what the problem might be or how to track it down? Might the video card or kernel extension be the problem? Any help would be highly appreciated.  <answer130934> Repeated kernel panics occurring without third party drivers can only be caused by a few things:  1) A peripheral device  2) A bad OSX image or bug in OSX itself  3) A hardware problem  In your case, it is unfortunately (3):     emSystem model name: MacBookPro6,2/em    The kernel panic indicates that your GPU is failing. emThis is a known issue for your machine./em Your model is subject to a replacement program for the logicboard due to a defective GPU. It lasts 3 years from the date of purchase. If this is already expired, Apple may or may not still replace your logicboard. It is ultimately at the discretion of the store manager. If you don't qualify, your other option would be a flat rate repair, for ~$300, which Apple will repair anything wrong with the machine for this fee. Best of luck.   <answer131085> Yes the GPU panics are almost certainly due to a defective discrete GPU card. I have the same 2010 MBP and have noticed 10.9.3 has increased the frequency of these fatal crashes significantly.  I'm using the gfxCardStatus utility to turn off this discrete card whenever possible but many apps force it on.  <answer132125> After a few arguments with a local Apple Store I contacted national Apple management and argued that the problems only started after upgrading to Maverick, which happened three years after purchase. Since they never mentioned Maverick would cause problems on a 2010 MacBook Pro the replacement program should still be applied. They finally agreed.  <answer177579> Apple has issued a recall for Macbook Pros Mid 2012. Others may be in the recall. I took it to a store and they had to replace the Logic board ($1000). Thankfully I did not have to pay a cent due to the recall. If you have "GPU Panic" based screen blanks, take it to Mac Shop/Repair shop and they will take care of it.  They will run a diagnostic and in 20 mins you will know if it is eligible.  This is not a software issue. Apple would have taken care of it that way. Reinstalling the OS is not an option.   This is a hardware issue. Logic board needs to be removed. Go to a mac store.  Read about the recall here: http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mac/widespread-2011-macbook-pro-failures-petition-lawsuit-repair-programme-3497935/  <answer178232> Seems like using the Kext Utility to clear and repair my kext permissions and doing a clean boot fixed this issue for me. Only tested for a few hours now but so far so good. Many people get a logic board replacement but I think it may have been a kext issue as every time I upgrade I run into kernel panics at some point. I push my machines to the limit and run into panics every 10 or so minutes when running on "Discrete GPU" only.   Now I can enable automatic switching without any problems. Hope this helps someone.  http://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/download/4286-kext-utility/  <answer212512> Im surprised that nobody on any forums has even touched on this answer i'm about to give and i HAD the exact same issues with mine that most ppl have been having.. So heres what ive found is the root of mine and a few ppls computers ive fixed due to gpu panics.. If you have corrupt or unsupported .jpeg, .mpeg, .mp4, PDF, or any related formats on your hd, it will cause GPU panics to happen.. So the best way to figure it out before thinking that your GPU is fried is get Tech Tool Pro or a similar app and do a file optimization test. On TTP it will tell u which ones and exactly where they r located.. I made the mistake of "upgrading" from Mavericks to Yosemite, and it messed everything up.. I ended up with over 1000 unsupported or corrupt files in those formats because of the "upgrade". It took a couple of painstaking hours to remove the files manually, but the panics have virtually stopped.. And my panics where absolutely infuriating.. I would turn my computer on and if i ran more than 1 or 2 apps at once, it would double panic, then 10 minutes later, it would do it again out of nowhere.. So a simple thing like taking all of those corrupt files fixed it.. Im amazed that all those "support techs" or "gurus" that work for mac havent shed any light on this, because its kinda common sense that would be one of the first things they should be thinking of when troubleshooting this VERY common issue! Hope this helps! If it did, please leave a like or comment, so i can keep personal track myself of how many headaches this might help be avoiding! ;)   hr  Use Tech Tool Pro or related software that has a strongfile optimization/strong feature and remove all corrupt or unsupported files that I listed above.  <comment153675> +1 I also suffer because of this for about half year now. Unfortunatelly It has begun after 3 years of purchase. <comment153676> Thanks for your reply. I am just out of the 3 year since purchase... <comment154618> I have had good luck with getting Apple to do the right thing on hardware a little past warranty expiry. <comment163839> I use the same program, but unfortunately can't disable discrete with an external monitor.. <comment163840> Both the Apple Store and Apple Support told me to shell out the cash because my 4 yr applecare warranty had just lapsed. I fear Apple has become the new Microsoft.. <comment175588> This series of laptops (2010-2011) with the discrete GPU have a known issue with the GPU that Apple seems perfectly happy not to do anything about - like a recall, or similar. There are many of them in the wild with defective GPU cards, but Apple is treating each occurrence as if they have never seen the problem before. I had a 2011 17" MBP that thankfully did NOT have the problem, but selling it second hand was surprisingly difficult, as the local shops all said they won't touch those models with a ten-foot pole. I guess the discrete GPU is just a case of "another thing to go wrong" ... <comment243862> Hey Ben, did apple repair you Macbook with a new Logic Board for free? <comment244474> Yes, they did. Though it took a few phone calls and several days from confirmation of the known GPU error before they finally agreed to replace for free. <comment256595> As written it's hard to understand what your actual answer is here. Future visitors probably are more interested in the steps you recommend to analyze/fix this than in your overall experience analyzing this. Could you try to turn your answer into more of a list of instructions on how to proceed? <comment256795> Sorry, i thought it was clear... Use Tech Tool Pro or RELATED software that has a FILE OPTIMIZATION feature and REMOVE all CORRUPT or UNSUPPORTED files that i listed above. Does that clear things up? <comment280356> Related: [OS X - GPU Panic](http://superuser.com/q/831617/87805) at SU.SE <comment289171> I've been helping a friend with this same model of MacBook Pro who was having random reboots.  This thread was a huge help understanding what was going on.  I actually just upgraded him to El Capitan and truly haven't seen any issues since.  I've been pushing it pretty hard all day, randomly opening various apps, a lot once, etc.  I think there's a chance the issue is somehow fixed in El Capitan.  Will update if it starts acting up again...
