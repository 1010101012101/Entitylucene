Show text in large type on the screen via terminal <body> I can put large text on the center of my screen with certain apps, such as Address Book (click on a phone number and choose "Show in Large Type") or using Quicksilver (type some text and choose the "Large Type" action).   Is there any way I can invoke this functionality from the terminal, to show arbitrary large text by writing, say, Applescript or a bash script?   <answer25212> Since you already have QuickSilver installed:  precodeosascript -e 'tell application "Quicksilver" to show large type "your text here"' /code/pre  You can use this to define a bash function (and put somewhere like code~/.profile/code):  precodefunction big {         osascript -e "tell application \"Quicksilver\" to show large type \"$1\"" } /code/pre  Then you can invoke it with arbitrary strings by doing  precode$ big "This will cause large text to appear" /code/pre  <comment28440> This is an insanely good question. <comment28451> That works, but can it be done without Quicksilver? <comment28454> [growl](http://growl.info/) supports text overlay from the command line - and it's fairly customizable even though most of the presets are for small - side of the screen display of text. I'd go with QuickSilver, though as it's easier to get exactly the format you ask.
