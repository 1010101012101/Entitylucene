HP P4515 printer in 10.7.4 - what driver? <body> HP's official support page lists the Laserjet P4515 as a compatible printer in 10.7 using the HP Print Software from Apple (per http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01664444&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en#N2473). However, the P4515 is not listed in my available printer software when installing a new printer.  Is there a different driver name I should be using which also matches the HP P4515 model?  <answer85946> It appears HP supports this printer with the P4014 series drivers.  Try installing them manually and use the codePrint and Scan/code page in codeSystem Preferences/code to add the printer to your machine.   http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/ProductList.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;taskId=135&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=3558788
