How can I turn on opening a link in another app again? <body> I'm using iOS 9.2 and I once accidentally tapped “don't allow” or something similar when WhatsApp was opening a link for Citymapper. It used to launch the Citymapper app, but now it goes to the less useful web interface.  I've looked through all the settings but I can't find any record of this preference to reset the permission.

If you tap emOPEN/em on that banner, it's supposed to re-establish the universal linking to the app instead of the website. Here it is in Apple's words:     When a user taps a universal link that [an app] handle[s], iOS also examines the user’s recent choices to determine whether to open [the] app or [the] website. For example, a user who has tapped a universal link to open [the] app can later choose to open [the] website in Safari by tapping a breadcrumb button in the status bar. After the user makes this choice, iOS continues to open [the] website in Safari until the user chooses to open [the] app by tapping OPEN in the Smart App Banner on the webpage.

But, this is a bit extreme, and there is most likely a better solution out there. <comment274078> I tried this, didn't seem to reset anything. Links to citymapper still open in web. <comment274389> If you would like more attention to this question (since I think it is a good one), I would suggest starting a bounty. <comment274452> I've tested your issue and I cant replicate it. I installed CityMapper and Whatsapp and tried to load a `citymapper://` url from Whatsapp. I pressed Cancel on the popup asking for permission to open the Citymapper App and nothing happened. Then I pressed the link again and the same popup appeared. I would suggest updating to the latest iOS version and the latest version of both apps. <comment274650> have you tried reinstalling the citymapper app? <comment274651> Yes, I have reinstalled both apps <comment275013> Good answer, but the link appears not to be a universal link, just a web link that is then triggering the citymapper app opening like this one: https://citymapper.com/eta/Tfkagpb. The page contains this metadata I've added to the question.
