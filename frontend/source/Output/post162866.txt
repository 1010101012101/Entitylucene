Safari CMD+Click link new tab focus <body> Is there a way to force focus to a new tab in safari when you cmd+click on links in google search results for example?   <answer162868> Command-Shift-click takes you to the newly-opened tab.  <answer162869> Go to Preferences â†’ Tabs and enable When a new tab or window opens, make it active.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DQyVZ.png" width="680"  Enabling this option switches the shift modifier to disabling this functionality rather than enabling it.  <comment191099> If you want even more options than what Safari has built-in, I highly recommend LinkThing which you can find at http://canisbos.com/linkthing (along with several other handy extensions). It does 2  things I love: #1) lets me set per-site preferences for where links open (new tabs or same tab) so, for example, Google Search results always open in new tabs without me having to cmd-click on them. #2) it re-writes Google search results links so they are actual links instead of links to Google which redirect you. Much easier to copy/paste the URL if that is what you were looking for.
