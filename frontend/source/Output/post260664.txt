How do I fix Pages autocorrecting incorrectly? <body> I'm using Pages, and I'm a pretty good typist, and a good speller. Regardless, Pages keeps autocorrecting my words like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hx9wY.png" alt="isotopepes"  I know I typed the word correctly. Pages inserted the extra letters for some reason. I would have thought it was just a mistake, but this is about the fifth time it's happened in writing my paper, and I've been paying increasing attention to make sure it's not me.  I left this sit, and typed some more, just to make sure I wasn't crazy, and just got this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMrFk.png" alt="enter image description here"  As a computerer (sic) programmer, I'm quite certain I can spell computer correctly, every time I try.  Is there a cache I can clear or setting I clear, besides turning off auto-correct entirely?   <comment334292> To clarify, are you averse to turning off auto-correct even just in Pages?
