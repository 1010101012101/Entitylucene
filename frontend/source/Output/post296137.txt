Buffalo DriveStation not mounting on Sierra <body> I've been having some trouble mounting my Buffalo DriveStation (HD-GDU3). This has happened on and off with previous versions of macOS, but I'm trying to solve the issue once and for all.  I plug in the drive and there's no activity whatsoever on my computer — it doesn't appear in Disk Utility,  System Profiler, and there's nothing logged in the system logs. However, the disk does spin up — I can feel it and hear it. I've also booted in Safe Mode, and still no dice.  I'm at a bit of a loss here. Unfortunately, I don't have another disk to try this on. What should I do here?
