What SIP voip client for OS X I could use? <body> I'm looking for a, preferably free, SIP client for OS X, one that will allow multiple SIP accounts and preferably supporting g729 audio codec.  <answer9879> Blink is a decent free VOIP client for Mac OS, though I'm not sure about g.729 support.  For that you may need to look at something like Mirial.  They have a Mac version but it doesn't have the Mac feel, and I think its expensive.  Bria might be another commercial option as well.  <answer9910> I prefer Telephone App over most the other VOIP clients I have come accross.
