Not seeing my HD in the disk utility <body> I tried to start up my computer and got a flashing file with a question mark.  So I held down the kbd‚å•/kbd-key on boot and brought it into recovery-mode.  After going through the different options I went to the disk utility and all I see is the grayed out SuperDrive and below there is strongdisk0/strong and strongMac OS X Base/strong system.   Leaving disk utility I went to strongreinstall Mac OS X/strong. After the verification and agreeing the terms, it doesn't show my harddrive.   Did I unmount the harddrive or what could the reason it's not showing up?  <answer86552> Since you have access to internet, read this instructions how to solve your problem.  Before you hack around always try the safe boot mode first, that will automatically check and repair the disk (in most cases).  If not, then follow the instructions below:  Resolve startup issues and perform disk maintenance with Disk Utility and fsck  http://support.apple.com/kb/TS1417  <answer233094> I am assuming that you got a flashing emfolder/em with a question mark similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1teY.jpg" alt="Flashing Question Mark"  That means your Mac cannot find the boot loader.    Now, since you said that you were able to go into disk utility, you already know how to boot into Recovery Mode.  What I am assuming you saw when you were working in Disk Utility is something similar to this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VmNSq.png" alt="enter image description here"  The SuperDrive being greyed out is probably because the drive is empty.  codedisk0/code is typically the disk drive in your Mac.  codeMac OS X Base System/code is more than likely a partition on codedisk0/code  strongDo this:/strong  Hold down the kbdOption/kbd while powering on your Mac.  If there is a bootable partition, it will be listed (other than the recovery partition).  If so, boot into it.    Once you have booted, check to see what you have selected as your startup disk (Preferences -- Startup Disk)  <comment100021> If your HD was dead, system would not start. If it is grayed out = you do NOT have the required permissions. <comment100023> Please elaborate. Your question is not clear. What is flashing? Can you log in? Did you try the safe boot mode? <comment100024> To perform a Safe Boot, press and hold the Shift key immediately after your Mac starts up. Continue holding down the Shift key until a gray Apple logo appears on the screen. Does this work? <comment100025> It is an image of a flashing file icon with a question mark in it. I tried holding shift and still get the flashing image.  My hd isn't grayed out its the superdrive with the cd(disk) icon next to it. <comment100026> So your title is wrong, you do not have the problem with the system drive (hd). And you computer operates normally. You have an Error with the Superdrive! <comment100027> Your supper drive is probably grayed out because there isn't a disc in it for Disk Utility to read. <comment100037> You tried to start up your computer!, So it is trying to start up from a external drive that is not there! <comment100041> Analogy-- A guy with stomach pain goes to doctor. Doctor performs brain transplant, however the stomach pain is still there. <comment117387> did you resolve this issue? <comment285086> Wow I forgot I posted this... It actually was my Sata cable.  I replaced that and everything works fine.  Thank you though... Your answer is right for many cases
