Any text editors that are emacs-like in extensibility but Apple-like in visual aesthetic and design? <body> Basically I want a text editor that is:  ol liSimple in visual design and uncluttered (like Byword)/li liPowerful and extensible like emacs (with hooks, etc, so I can customize it to my needs). When I say "extensible", I mean the more the better. I don't have a particular hook/extension in mind, but basically the closer to emacs the better. (I think of emacs as being the pinnacle of extensibility.)/li /ol  I know there's Aquamacs (which meets 2), but Aquamacs looks really ugly and not at all appealing (so doesn't meet 1).  strongPlease make answers detailed!/strong Explain why the text editor you are recommending fits this question. In what ways is it extensible? What nice UI touches does it have?br The goal here isn't to build a list of text editors; it's to compile information about exactly how various text editors are both well-designed and extensible.  <answer59009> My personal favourite is textmate, there are loads of websites out there that detail how to easily customize it, and it's actually very easy. You can download themes and install snippets for code editing in a variety of different languages and the interface is clean and beautiful.  <answer59015> Sublime Text 2 is actually pretty damn good!  <answer59023> In the App Store, you can search for "Text Wrangler": it's the free version of BBEdit.  <answer59058> Chocolat clearly wins on the native UI front. It works a bit like Sublime Text 2 but blends in more beautifully in OS X.  And it has a neat way of adding extras, called Truffles. Most of the extras come directly from github and can be listed and installed with a nice window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e53Kk.png" alt="Chocolat Truffles"  You have to see if it's still powerful enough for your needs depending on what exactly you want a text editor to extend with.  <answer59148> This might be too obvious, but what about setting up a strongTerminal/strong window with a font and color scheme you find attractive (some are suggested, but you can customize to your heart's content)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vpCfK.png" alt="enter image description here"  and then runâ€¦ codeemacs/code.  It clearly meets your second criterion (it, by definition, has all the power of emacs), and as for the first, here's a comparison:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wiqVv.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQAQq.png" alt="enter image description here"  They look pretty similar. Choose a different font for the Terminal window if you want a better match. The biggest distinction is that Byword allows fonts that are not monospaced, but emacs insists on monospaced fonts.  <comment68007> I'd say the editor being powerful is much more important than looking good, because more power means it can do more things for you, more things can be automated. <comment68114> Please add detail to this answer or it will be deleted.
