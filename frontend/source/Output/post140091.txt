Use Function Keys as Keyboard Shortcut <body> I have a Macbook Pro 13" with Retina Display running OS X Mavericks 10.9.4  I use Code Editors like PHPStorm which Require me to use the Function Keys as Keyboard Shortcuts like Command+F6.  But F6 just increases my backlighting.   I want the function Keys to do this special stuff when used alone and behave as normal Function keys when I add something before it like Cmd.  For example : F11 should decrease volume, but Cmd+F11 should be a shortcut  <answer140092> I think you got two options:  ol liEnable function keys to work like normal keys and to activate their special functions – like increasing volume etc. – when pressing emfn/em beforehand.  ul liOpen emSystem Preferences/em/li liSelect preference pane emKeyboard/em/li liSelect emKeyboard/em tab/li liActivate option emUse all F1, F2, etc, keys as standard function keys/em img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HkpRn.jpg" alt="Image courtesy by OSXDaily.com"     Image taken from OSXDaily.com /li /ul/li liSet custom app shortcuts for your programs that need function keys in their shortcuts.  ul liOpen emSystem Preferences/em/li liSelect preference pane emKeyboard/em/li liSelect emShortcuts/em tab /li liSelect group emApp Shortcuts/em/li liPress em+/em and add your needed shortcuts – those already existent in the editor. Just select the corresponding app, insert the shortcut name (name in the menu connected to the shortcut) and enter shortcut already set by the program. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M320I.png" alt="Image courtesy by geeksays.com"     Image taken from Geeksays.com /li /ul/li /ol
