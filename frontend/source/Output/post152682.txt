Why does tcpdump not recognise piped input? <body>   ol liI obtained a packet capture file:  precode$ sudo tcpdump -w file.pcap /code/pre/li liI can then analyse that file:  precode$ tcpdump -r file.pcap /code/pre  I can even use file redirection to read from standard input:  precode$ tcpdump -r - &lt; file.pcap /code/pre/li liHowever, I cannot use a pipe to read from standard input:  precode$ cat file.pcap | tcpdump -r - tcpdump: unknown file format /code/pre  This emshould/em work.  What's going on?/li /ol  OS X Yosemite 10.10br/ tcpdump version 4.3.0 -- Apple version 59br/ libpcap version 1.5.3 - Apple version 47  hr  supI'm actually trying to codesudo tcpdump -w - | tee file.pcap | tcpdump -r -/code, which gives rise to the same problem&mdash;however it appears to arise with any form of piped input./sup  <answer171548> I have the same problem on Mavericks (10.9.5).  It's probably not the best answer but I downloaded the open source version of tcpdump (tcpdump-4.6.2) and put it in my path before the system version and it works with pipes.  Of course, you lose the extra Apple-specific functionality.  <comment197203> I just ran into this myself. I'm glad your Q is here so I know I'm not crazy ... no solution yet. The same commands work fine on Ubuntu
