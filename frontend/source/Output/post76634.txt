Is there a way to make Finder always expand to "Show All" by default in "Icon View"? <body> Is there a way to make Finder always expand to "Show All" by default in "Icon View"?  I am referring to this situation where the "Show All" is collapsed by default:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyEu7.png" alt=""  <answer76675> I have a two-part answer for you. The short answer is no, you cannot "Show All" by default in the Icon view you are using.  The good news, and second part of the answer, is that you can change the folder View settings to eliminate this completely.  ol liOpen one of the folders with which you are having an issue./li liSelect strongShow View Options/strong from the emView/em menu./li liChange the emArranged By/em setting to strongName/strong or strongNone/strong./li liThen Select emSort By/em to whatever way you prefer. strongKind/strong will be the secondary arrangement.  /li liYou may also wish to check the box, strongAlways open in Icon view/strong./li /ol  Once this is set the way you wish, you can also click the strongUse as Default/strong button at the bottom of the View options window.  <answer226575> On closer inspection this appears to be a bug. If you populate a folder with only sub-folders (no other file types) then the 'show all' remains the default when you leave and re-enter the folder. Also, I mysteriously have one folder on my mac with multiple file types where the 'show all' option appears to be the default. Definitely a bug.  <comment89240> Thanks, this is I think more tolerable, but ideally I liked to be able to arrange my files by `Kind`. That's what I've been doing since Snow Leopard, as far as I can remember. <comment141268> Well, there is no out-of-the-box way to achieve this. Are there any way to achieve this using Apple script?
