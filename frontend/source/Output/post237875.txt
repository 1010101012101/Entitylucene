How to disable sparkle.framework updates for specific app? <body> I need to disable auto updates for one of the apps installed in my Mac (OS X 10.11.4). The developer keeps releasing new versions but I want to stay at a specific version that works just as I need.  ul liThis is not a store app, I downloaded it from the developer's site./li liI know this app uses the Sparkle.framework for autoupdating./li liThe application does not offer any options/preferences to control automatic updates. They just happen./li /ul  Every couple of days the application updates itself and I have to manually downgrade to the version I want to keep.  Is there anything I can do so the application doesn't update automatically? I'm confortable with the command line and editing low level stuff, but I am not familiar with the sparkle update process.  <answer282595> You can try steps listed below - it worked in case of All2MP3 app, that was taken by rogue developer and changed into malware deployment platform.  ol liMake backup of your original old app version!/li liRight click on the app and choose codeShow Package Contents/code./li liOpen codeinfo.plist/code file in your preferred text editor (I use TextWrangler)/li liSearch for codeSUEnableAutomaticCheck/code/li liIn the line below change codeYES/code to codeNO/code/li liSave file. Your app should stop updating automatically./li /ol
