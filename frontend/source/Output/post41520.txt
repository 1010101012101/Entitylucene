What's a good program to batch resize 100,000 jpg images? <body> The program should run in batch mode to resize all files in a folder and then save new files to different folder. An option for setting jpg quality would be great, too.  <answer41524> Graphic Converter  The best for this..  <answer41530> I use wine (and XQuartz) and IrfanView. Of course you could also use imagemagick from the command-line. For wine and imagemagick I would recommend Homebrew.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wgcx.png" alt="irfanview in wine on OS X"  <answer41531> ImageMagick is a command line interface program and made for this purpose. The use and installation of ImageMagick can intimidating, but this image manipulation package is the most powerfull I have encountered so far. As the installation from source can be a hassle for native OS X users I advise you to use Homebrew.  To install ImageMagick using Homebrew run this oneliner in your terminal:  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)" /code/pre  Homebrew is now installed, it is wise to follow the installer's suggestions after installation. Now we install ImageMagick using codebrew/code.  precodebrew install imagemagick /code/pre  ImageMagick is now installed and it's codeconvert/code program can be used for your purpose. To convert a big jpg image to a smaller png image your can run  precodeconvert input.jpg -geometry 800x600 output.png /code/pre  To answer your question "How to resize all files in a folder and save them in a different folder" you can run the following script.  precode# create output dir mkdir -p "../resized"  # Convert all .jpg files in the current folder for image in *.jpg; do     convert $x -geometry 800x600 resized/$x done /code/pre  ImageMagick can convert over 100 different image formats, and almost all tricks you can do with Photoshop you can do with ImageMagick.  <answer41538> I like to use ImageMagick. codesips/code and Automator (which use an identical resizing method) make images look too blurry without additional sharpening in my opinion.  You can install ImageMagick with codebrew install imagemagick/code after installing Homebrew or with codesudo port install imagemagick/code after installing MacPorts. Then run a command like this:  precodemogrify -filter lanczos2 -resize '500x500&gt;' -format jpg -quality 90 -path /tmp/ *.jpg /code/pre  code500x500&gt;/code makes images wider or taller than 500px fit to 500x500px. code500x/code would always change the width to 500 px and code500x500^/code would make all images at least 500x500px. code-path /tmp//code saves the output files to code/tmp//code instead of modifying files in place.  codeLanczos2/code or the 2-lobe Lanczos is very similar to codeCatrom/code. Compared to codeLanczos/code (codeLanczos3/code), they are slightly less sharp, produce less ringing artifacts, and produce more Moiré patterns. The default filter for making images smaller is codeTriangle/code, which often makes images too blurry in my opinion.  code-quality 100/code creates files about twice as big code-quality 95/code, which creates files about twice as big as code-quality 88/code.  More information:  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/resize/br http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/br http://lri.me/shell1.txt  Here's a similar command that uses codesips/code:  codefor f in *.jpg; do sips -Z 500 -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 80 "$f" /tmp/; done/code  code-Z 500/code is like code500x500&gt;/code in ImageMagick.  If others have less than 100,000 images, you might also use Preview:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TwbIk.png" alt=""  Preview used to use the same resizing method as codesips/code and Automator, but it has used a different one since 10.7. I prefer ImageMagick's codeLanczos2/code though.  I uploaded a comparison of the different options to http://19a5b0.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/imagemagick-osx-resizing/index.html.  <answer41548> I'm a little surprised that no one has mentioned the easiest, cheapest, and least technical option:  h1Automator/h1  First, open Automator, which is in your Applications folder.  Next, choose to create a new workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bhemA.png" alt="Create an automator workflow"  Next, add the following steps to the workflow by dragging and dropping:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FosE9.png" alt="workflow steps"  When you run this, Automator is going to:  ol lipop up a window asking you to pick some files (as many as you want)/li lipop up another window asking where you want to save the resized emcopies/em/li liask you how big you want the resized copies to be.  You'll be able to choose either a fixed size or a percentage.  All the images will be resized to either that size or by that percentage./li /ol  (The "show this action when the workflow runs" checkbox means that the workflow is going to pause, display the option, and allow you to change it then)  Once you do that, Automator is going to churn and burn, and when it's done it'll beep at you.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have an option to choose JPEG quality.  However, for the price (free), it's pretty dang convenient.  <answer41575> Several people have mentioned ImageMagick. Here is a recipe: For simplicity, assume all the files are in one folder (and the folder contains nothing else). Open a terminal window, cd into this folder, then run  precodemkdir ../resized for x in *.jpg; do convert -geometry 800x600 $x ../resized/$x /code/pre  where you replace the 800x600 by whatever size you want.  Advantages include a great amount of flexibility in ImageMagick's codeconvert/code, such as the ability to select different quality settings for the target image, or setting the resize option by percentages. Or you can use code-geometry 800x800/code, in which case the aspect ratio will be preserved, but the maximum of the width and height will be 800 pixels.  Disadvantages are the obvious ones: It requires a certain familiarity with the command line, plus a willingness to plough through the command line options of codeconvert/code for the settings you want. This is not a task for the faint of heart.  <answer41584> I usually import all of the pictures into iPhoto and then export them to the different sizes. I have done it on batches of 300 or so images, but never on the scale you are wanting. Still, it may be an option.  <answer41675> I second GraphicConverter. I've been a registered user for 16 years. Its main purpose is batch-processing image editing, and it has a good user interface for designing custom workflows and saving them.  You can also use it in conjunction with Automator, but you probably won't need to.  Here is some information from GraphicConverter's page explaining their batch processing image editing functions.     strongBatch conversion with additional functions/strong       GraphicConverter offers you sophisticated batch  processing which   fully automates repetitive tasks applied to a selection of pictures:      ul   liConvert all the selected source pictures easily and quickly into a new format - regardless of whether there are 5 or 5,000 picture files;   you just define the type of conversion and set the details /li   liDuring the conversion process you can apply up to 60 additional batch functions such as rotation, resize, change the resolution, etc./li   liAutomate the removal of the Mac OS Ressourcefork before documents are uploaded if there are compatibility problems when the picture   files are placed in the internet /li   liCreate catalogs in HTML format for publication in the internet and adjust the colors, sizes, etc. to your individual requirements (see   examples)/li   liRename a selection of documents according to special criteria  quickly and easily/li   liJoin pictures together (e.g. for QuickTime VR)/li   liInsert or extract IPTC information into or out of a variety of  document formats /li   liand much more .../li   /ul   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2ptti.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer41705> This is yet another simple, clean and effective batch image resize script. If you are dealing with graphics and different resolutions a lot, you can use this script and save it with different values for occasional uses.  Do so, by changing this codetarget_width/code strong120/strong value to your needs and save the script. Now drag your image(s) onto the saved script-file to start resizing your image(s).  hr  strongOpen Script Editor, and create the following new script:/strong  precode-- save in Script Editor as Application -- drag files to its icon in Finder  on open some_items   repeat with this_item in some_items     try       rescale_and_save(this_item)     end try   end repeat end open   to rescale_and_save(this_item)   tell application "Image Events"     launch     set the target_width to 120     -- open the image file     set this_image to open this_item      set typ to this_image's file type      copy dimensions of this_image to {current_width, current_height}     if current_width is greater than current_height then       scale this_image to size target_width     else       -- figure out new height       -- y2 = (y1 * x2) / x1       set the new_height to (current_height * target_width) / current_width       scale this_image to size new_height     end if      tell application "Finder" to set new_item to ¬     (container of this_item as string) &amp; "scaled." &amp; (name of this_item)     save this_image in new_item as typ    end tell end rescale_and_save /code/pre  original source  <answer42236> No one has mentioned Apple Aperture.  While by no means the cheapest, it comes with a lot of other things that you may find useful. It basically replaces iPhoto and then some. It does 95% of what photographers commonly use Photoshop for. (It won't do flaming text. :-)  But unless you need the other things Aperture gives you, I second both the ImageMagick approach -- if you're not intimidated by downloading, installing, and running command-line programs, and the Automator approach, which despite @markhunte's claim, is free.  <answer86320> Preview is certainly a good solution for some occasional resizing. There are also other nice free options, such as ImageMagic (command-line utility), Preview or something else plus Automator, etc.  However, if this is a part of your job and you need a true flexibility, a special-purpose application will save you a lot of time, and offer much more opportunities.  Many users chose our batch image resizer Resize Sense (http://veprit.com/resizesense) for its outstanding flexibility and convenience.  Disclaimer: I am the developer. You better judge Resize Sense yourself. The introductory video on the product website will tell you exactly what is so special in Resize Sense. There is a free demo version.  <comment47090> Can you explain why GC is the best option? <comment47094> I've used Irfanview for over 10 years on the PC and love it. But they don't have a Mac version? <comment47121> It maybe the least technical for someone who does not use Terminal. And possibly the easiest, But its not the cheapest out of the answers here. Sips is included in the Unix build of the Mac. And ImageMagick is also free. <comment47122> I Suspect they mean they run IrFranView under wine. Wine lets you run Windows software on other operating systems. With Wine, you can install and run these applications just like you would in Windows. The screenshot clearly shows Mac type windows (buttons at top) with PC Window GUI <comment47132> Using Wine with a Windows application is really an overkill for something that you can do natively. <comment47134> A combination of find and ImageMagic. <comment47209> Whilst this may theoretically answer the question, [it would be preferable](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/8259) to include the essential parts of the answer here, and provide the link for reference. <comment47283> thanks, that's what I ended up using - however I installed it on Drupal since I'm importing the images into Drupal. <comment48001> It's safe to assume that Automator is, for the purposes of this discussion free because it is reasonable to assume that @mototribe is running OS X. My one concern would be how well Automator would handle 100,000 images but, assuming they're not all in a single folder, I'd just keep feeding it one folder at a time until it was done. I've run this very workflow against *hundreds* of images without difficulty. I see no reason why it wouldn't work against many thousands, as each image is pushed through one-at-a-time, but I'd be in trust but verify mode. <comment63982> I'd like to warn you to use `mogrify`: this converts the files in-place, overwriting the original ones! If anything goes wrong, you have lost your files! Better use `convert` (also from ImageMagick). <comment65042> @KurtPfeifle It doesn't if you specify the `-path` option (which `convert` doesn't currently have). <comment111610> Yep Automator did the job perfectly. I came here thinking "I have find a command line utility that would batch-resize images"... Sometimes the easiest solution is also the best. Cheers. <comment120264> @the_karel, I just enhanced your previous post. I hope you do not mind. <comment120282> @grgarside, thanks for the corrections. <comment138416> If you are going for speed then `sips` is maybe the better choice. On a quick test with 1,000 JPGs á ~5 MB resizing to 800px width took ~1 min. with `sips` and ~8 min. with `mogrify` (with disk buffers purged, using GNU Parallel on a quadcore).
