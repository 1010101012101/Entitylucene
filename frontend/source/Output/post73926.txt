Is there a command to install a dmg <body> I want to install a dmg file on a remote server. All I have is an ssh access. Since a DMG is a disk image, I tried to mount it, but mount does not seem to recognize its format.   codefile/code says my dmg file is a codeVAX COFF executable/code.   <answer73928> You could try the command codeopen disk://host.tld/image.dmg/code.  <answer73929> You should be able to mount the code.dmg/code using:  precodehdiutil attach /path/to/file.dmg /code/pre  And then copy its contents (which appears in code/Volumes/code) where ever you like.  <answer73931> First, mount the dmg image : codesudo hdiutil attach &lt;image&gt;.dmg/code  The image will be mounted to code/Volumes/&lt;image&gt;/code. Mine contained a package which i installed with: codesudo installer -package /Volumes/&lt;image&gt;/&lt;image&gt;.pkg -target //code  Finally unmount the image: codesudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/&lt;image&gt;/code.  <comment85884> `open` didn't do anything, just exit, without error message. <comment85895> Yes it does. I just tested it. It won't display anything until the disk image has been completely mounted, so you will have to wait a minute or so before it appears in /Volumes. (It works if you ssh in and type `open path/to/file.dmg`. I don't think `disk://host.tld/` works though.) <comment140428> Helpful, though maybe not exactly what the OP needed. Thanks. <comment223622> I wrote a blog post about installing .dmg files that you can save as a recipe for the apps you use on your machine. Hope this helps: http://grantgeorge.io/install-dmg-recipe/
