OS X: Schedule Launchctl to quit application at certain time <body> I have created this codelaunchctl/code code.plist/code for opening an application at a specific time every day â€“ or the next time the computer emwakes from sleep/em.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;caffeine-timecontrol.job&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;/Applications/Caffeine.app/Contents/MacOS/Caffeine&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;dict&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;40&lt;/integer&gt;             &lt;key&gt;Hour&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;7&lt;/integer&gt;             &lt;key&gt;WeekDay&lt;/key&gt;&lt;integer&gt;1234567&lt;/integer&gt;         &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  The above is supposed to wake app codeCaffeine/code at code7:40 AM/code codeEvery day/code.  However, can I also include a clause to make the application terminate at code00:00 AM/code codeEvery day/code if the computer is emawake/em?  Meaning, is there an opposite to codeStartCalendarInterval/code, or would I have to go about it some other way, .e.g. via codecrontab/code?  <answer230411> One of these two methods should work, but I admit I have not tested them:   ol liEither you could write an AppleScript a la/li /ol  codetell application "Caffeine" to quit/code  put this in a file, then either launch the file from an codeosascript/code command or  put it into Script Editor and save it as an application and launch that as a an app  ol start="2" lior you could use the good old killall command. You would have to lookup the name of process of the Caffeine process and send it a   codekillall Caffeine/code/li /ol  command, assuming that the process name of the Caffeine app is Caffeine (check  it from the Activity monitor or the ps command)  <comment281218> Thanks for your reply. I think the first method will work nicely whereby `launchctl` runs an AppleScript via `osascript`.
