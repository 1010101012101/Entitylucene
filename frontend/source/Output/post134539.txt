Calendar app not able to add subscription to "on my mac" <body> strongHow do I get apple calendar to add calendar subscriptions to my greyed out "On My Mac" section?/strong  I am not able to add calendar subscriptions to my "on my mac" subscription section, instead I am forced to put all subscriptions into the iCloud section (greyed out "On My Mac" section). Earlier I was able to do this without problems.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DqOE0.png" alt="calendar app &quot;On My Mac&quot; greyed out"  <answer134595> In Calendar-Preferences-Acccounts, disable iCloud.  Then create a new calendar, giving it a name that doesn't conflict with any of the calendars in your iCloud.  Now you can re-enable the iCloud account.  The new calendar (under "On My Mac") remains.  <comment159272> Is On My Mac enabled in Calendar's Accounts list? <comment159275> Do you mean on the side where I can add calendars or Calendar/preferences.../accounts ? <comment159306> Just for clarification this works for adding calendars as well as adding subscribed calendars. Thank you very much for the simple answer :D
