My MBP's DHCP lease time is an hour, but every other device has 30 <body> This last few days I've noticed my MacBook Pro's having issues with the connectivity each time I start it back from sleep.  Checking the DHCP clients list of my router (a good ol' Linksys WRT54G2), I've noticed that, even if I changed the DHCP lease time to 30hs, my MBP always has 1h of lease time after reconnecting (the first row is my MBP):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/67Yuz.png" alt="My router&#39;s DHCP Clients list"  My a-ha moment was last night, when I saw emanother/em MacBook connected with the same expiry time. The other client's are Android phones, a Linux laptop, and some Windows computers - no issues at all. But this other MacBook had the same expiry time.  This week I've upgraded from Yosemite to ElCapitan. I think it should be related, but I'm not sure how/why.  strongWhat should I do to avoid this issue?/strong  <comment285376> I'm not sure that's the root of your issue;' just because the lease hasn't expired doesn't mean it can't request again & get the same IP Address, otherwise how would a permanently assigned address work? <comment285383> I _may_ assign a static IP, but it feels much more like a workaround than fixing the thing. It _may_ be possible that those two things aren't cause-effect, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were - after all, they're two different aspects of the wireless connection that changed at the same time. I'm 100% sure I had greater expiry time before - it was set to 24hs on the router, and worked for the MBP too.
