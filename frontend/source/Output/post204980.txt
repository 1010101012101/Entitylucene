How to restart Safari (also clearing history and cookies) after being inactive (time based)? <body> I'm working on a Mac with parental control and it's supposed to be a kiosk Mac. I'm wondering if there is a similar Applescript that can tell Safari to restart after given for example 45 minutes? Is there any chance that while restart it also clearing surfing history and cookies during the restart process?  Another question had something similar though it's about shutting down Safari at given time.
