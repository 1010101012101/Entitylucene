Slow loading/transparent menu bar during startup <body> Sometimes when I startup my Mac, I notice that the menu bar doesn't load fully. It remains completely transparent and doesn't have a title (or any menu options) for the current application. It doesn't even have the Apple logo on the top left side.  Here's a picture of what it looks like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EDXjD.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any idea what causes this or how to fix it?  <answer9316> This happens to me too sometimes. A guaranteed solution: Restart the menu bar. Here's how:  Open Terminal (/Applications/Utilities). Type: codekillall SystemUIServer/code.brcodekillall/code restarts the following process, and codeSystemUIServer/code is the process in charge of the menu bar.br Once you press enter, the menu bar will disappear and reappear. It should be working fine.  <comment9880> It happens to me on a Mac Pro with 8 cores and 10GB RAM, but it usually goes away when you just switch to the finder back and forth another app, since the new app must refresh the bar.
