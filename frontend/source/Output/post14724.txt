Is there a way to turn on indicator that a directory item is a shell script in Terminal? <body> When I do an ls of a directory and a shell script is listed as a directory item, is there a way I can have a visual indication that it is a shell script ?  For example:  precodeFrom /opt/local/bin  ls -l /code/pre  Displays port from MacPorts as an ordinary item:  precodeport /code/pre  Can I have color coding, bold or some other way to see this ?  I know I can use file to check if it's a script, executable, etc., but that's an extra command I have to issue and is no better than trying to run port and then getting an error and typing ./port.  Thanks!  Scott  <answer14737> Try typing codels -G/code in terminal, you should see colored listings by file type.  If the scripts aren't being shown in a different color, this means that they are not marked as executable, so you will need to type codesudo chmod +x &lt;filename&gt;/code to make them so.  Then they should appear in a different color as opposed to directorys etc.  If you prefer not to always type ls -G then you can put the following command in your code.bashrc/code file in your home directory  codealias "ls"="ls -G"/code  Then restart terminal and you should see colored output whenever you just type codels/code  <answer14740> As I’m not a fan of colours — they depend on the current terminal colour settings to look good — I prefer to use codels -F/code.  Borrowing from SCO Unix, I define an codelf/code alias in code~/.bashrc/code:  precodealias lf="ls -F" /code/pre  Executable files such as shell scripts show up with a code*/code at the end of their names. Similarly, code//code for directories and code@/code for symbolic links.  <answer14789> You can set this in your code~/.bash_profile/code file to enable colors equivalent to codels -G/code:  precode#!/bin/sh export CLICOLOR=1 /code/pre  <comment15861> I'm pretty sure there is an environment variable that controls ls's color options. That would be the better thing to change <comment15877> @Fake Name - Thanks guys!  This is what I was looking for. <comment15878> Thanks!  The color highlighting was what I was looking for, but I had no idea of the asterisk option - I'll add this to my toolkit.
