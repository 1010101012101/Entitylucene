Cannot delete iTunes U from iPod classic <body> Device: iPod classic, 160GB // iPod software: 1.12 // iTunes version: 11.0.3  I have a substantial number of iTunes U files on my iPod classic, taking up an enormous amount of space. I am unable to manually delete them, and although the media type is still locked in as iTunes U, they are not being recognized as such (I only found them by setting up a smart playlist based on file size).  I cannot do a general sync with iTunes library, as most of my belongings-- including the laptop that originally housed my music library and all my original CDs-- were lost in a fire. So my entire music collection now lives on this iPod classic, and obviously I will be devastated if it is lost. I have been ALL over the internet researching this, and while there are many people with the same problem, I have yet to find a solution.   I am about to use a 3rd party app to transfer everything from the iPod onto my laptop, wipe the iPod, and resync it. This is, of course, not an optimal solution, not least of all because it basically goes over Apple's head. Is there seriously NO OTHER WAY to delete these huge zombie files??? I've been using Apple exclusively since 1982, and this is THE most trouble I have ever had with any of their products.  <comment108829> Could you clarify a couple things by editing some details into your question? What version of iOS are you running on your iPod? Are the iTunes U files in the music app? (Or are they in the iTunes U app?)
