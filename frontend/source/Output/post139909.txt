Set Alias for Terminal Window in Applescript <body> After opening multiple terminal windows and running commands in them, it becomes difficult to send another command to a specific terminal window.   How can we set an alias for each terminal window so we can specifically target it later? Heres a code snippet of what I am trying to do (apparently the code doesn't work)  precodetell application "Terminal"      activate              do script "./start-1.sh" in window 1     // then set an alias for this window: 'start1'      do script "./start-2.sh" in window 2     // then set an alias for this window: 'start2'      do script "/monitor.sh" in window 3     // then set an alias for this window 'monitor'      // send command to a specific window using its alias     do script "shutdown -n 0" in window 'monitor'  end tell /code/pre  <answer139912> One non-applescript solution to your problem may be to open the Terminal Preferences... select Settings. Then, under the Window tab select the Command Key check box. This will add a command key to the title bar to instantly switch to that window (so Window titles would have ⌘1, ⌘2, etc. appended to the window title.  <answer140978> What you really need to save are the emtabs/em—those can be used again in a codedo script/code action (even if they are just one per window).  This script:  pre tell application "Terminal"     activate     set tab1 to (do script "echo foo")     do script "echo bar" in tab1     do script "echo baz" -- in new window     do script "echo back again" in tab1 end tell /pre  will produce this in one window:  precode$ echo foo foo $ echo bar bar $ echo back again back again $ /code/pre  and this in another:  precode$ echo baz baz /code/pre
