Save an app for later download? <body> I am looking for a way to create a wish list in the App Store, like you can in iTunes on the desktop.   Is it possible to do this on the App Store from an iPhone?  <answer17180> That is actually a feature I've seen with "third party" app stores but never in the official App Store itself. I did however just check and I guess the closest in relevancy is the feature to "Tell A Friend". I presume you could simply tell yourself by emailing the direct link for that App Store application.  <answer40583> Click the arrow next to the price and select "Add to Wish List".  <comment46243> This works in *iTunes* in which the OP already knows it is possible. <comment46521> up vote 0 down vote    He ask about the iPhone app store. "Is it possible to do this on the iPhone App Store?" <comment46541> He asked if it was possible to do "from an iPhone". As far as I can tell, it isn't.
