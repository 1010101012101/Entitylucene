Mac Pro 2013 10.9.5 Web Rendering Issue <body> My Mac Pro has decided to start rendering web pages strangely.  Consider:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fJ8tI.png" alt="Strange web page rendering"  Much of the time the initial render is just fine, but as you scroll down, you find chunks of the page missing. Sometimes, if I scroll up and down quickly, the chunk eventually fills in.  Now, this image is from Safari 7.1.8, but I have also seen it in Chrome Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit).  It did not used to do this. It's only started in the past week or so. I know that the OS is not recent, nor is Safari. Chrome is up to date, however, and nothing has changed at the OS level recently.  When it gets too awful, I reboot the machine and it seems to work "ok" for awhile.  That's all I have, I really not sure how to approach this.
