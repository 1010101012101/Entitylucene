Old 'unknown' versions of applications appearing in Spotlight search results <body> When I migrated my old Mac to my new one, I copied some applications over from code/Applications/code on the old Mac. Some of these were App Store apps, which I of course had to reinstall from the App Store in order to actually run them.  What's happened though, is there are some apps that appear in duplicates, with a white nondescript document icon like so:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KgxfK.png" alt="enter image description here"  What's going on here? Can I fix this? I've tried reindexing Spotlight both through the GUI exceptions and via Terminal and codescutil/code, but to no avail. I've also tried searching "This Mac" for the files, but they don't appear in Finder search results anywhere. The plot also thickens when you compare the created/modified dates of the duplicate to it's proper original: they're always the same.  <comment346836> A couple of ideas: (1) Do you see the duplicates in System Information.app → Software → Applications?  (2) Does `sudo ls /Applications` reveal anything interesting? <comment346838> Also, if you are using Spotlight to back up to a local HD have you excluded that drive from the Spotlight index? <comment346839> Nice @Bob - `sudo ls /Applications` showed nothing out of the ordinary, but _some_ of the duplicates do appear in System Information.app → Software → Applications. Catch: not all of them do, e.g. this particular example of Sketch. Thinking this might be a red herring? Most of the paths that appear on the dupes that exist are in `/Downloads`. <comment346840> @SteveChambers not the case here. <comment346842> @brandonscript Did you mean `/Downloads` or `~/Downloads`? <comment346844> Yeah, sorry `~/Downloads` <comment346888> Have you tried showing hidden files and going to the location the file says it is? It's possible that the file exists as a ghost file (i.e. It's there but it has no data) <comment346934> I'd be tempted to use a cleaning utility (like Onyx) and let it do everything it can, reboot and see what happens. This is **weird.** <comment346947> I've tried `ls -as` and nothing hidden appears, and I've tried a cleaning tool. Unfortunately the ghost files don't show a path in the Spotlight results so I don't even know where to look.
