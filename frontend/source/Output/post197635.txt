SDK, CaptiveNetwork Reference, must I set Wifi first? <body> Interested in https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/SystemConfiguration/Reference/CaptiveNetworkRef/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009770   This makes possible to authenticate from an App to join a Wifi Captive portal.  My question is: assuming the Wifi is detected in Wifi Settings, do I need first to set the Wifi in Wifi settings, - then go to the App to authenticate - ?  Or can I only directly authenticate into the App, and nevergo to Settings ?  Thanks
