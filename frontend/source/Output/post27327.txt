iTunes is not recognising my iPhone after upgrading to Lion <body> I've just upgraded my Mac to Lion, and now my iPhone is not being recognised in iTunes.  I've tried...  ul liUpdating iTunes (to 10.5) /li liChecking for all updates/li liRestarting both the Mac and iPhone/li liExtracting iTunesHelper.app from the iTunes bundle and installing it into the Login Items list, and confirmed it's running in the Activity Monitor./li /ul  For the past 3 years I've been happy with the "It just works" idea, but not today. :(  What other options are there?  <answer27329> Start by checking in the system profiler under USB to see if the Mac see's that the iPhone is connected. .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EbvUa.png" alt="System Profiler"  Then remove the following to the Trash and RESTART the computer  /System/Library/Extensions and Locate the file strongAppleMobileDevice.kext/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cDN8m.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment31392> Does the phone's screen light up when you connect it? Does it charge when connected to the computer? Have you tried another cable? <comment31394> @Jannemans - Yes the phone lights up and charges ok. <comment31395> SOLVED: Out of desperation I downloaded and installed iTunes a second time, and now the phone is detected! Don't understand why the first update to 10.5 didn't do the trick. <comment31396> Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try these, as I found a second install of iTunes ended up solving the problem. It will be handy having this post here for the future though, in case I encounter the problem again. <comment61666> @Bill you should mark your question as answered since the problem is resolved :-)
