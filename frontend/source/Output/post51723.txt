Errors on kernel.log... how do I fix them? <body> My mac is apparently working fine, no crashes of any kind, but my kernel.log is full of errors and that is worrying me, as I never saw it with messages like that. This is a sample of today, since I booted the machine:  precodeMay 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: PMAP: PCID enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: Darwin Kernel Version 11.4.0: Mon Apr  9 19:32:15 PDT 2012; root:xnu-1699.26.8~1/RELEASE_X86_64 May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: vm_page_bootstrap: 3051327 free pages and 78017 wired pages May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: kext submap [0xffffff7f80732000 - 0xffffff8000000000], kernel text [0xffffff8000200000 - 0xffffff8000732000] May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: zone leak detection enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: standard timeslicing quantum is 10000 us May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: mig_table_max_displ = 73 May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: TSC Deadline Timer supported and enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=1 LocalApicId=0 Enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=2 LocalApicId=2 Enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=3 LocalApicId=4 Enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=4 LocalApicId=6 Enabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=5 LocalApicId=255 Disabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=6 LocalApicId=255 Disabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=7 LocalApicId=255 Disabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: AppleACPICPU: ProcessorId=8 LocalApicId=255 Disabled May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: calling mpo_policy_init for TMSafetyNet May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: Security policy loaded: Safety net for Time Machine (TMSafetyNet) May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: calling mpo_policy_init for Sandbox May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: Security policy loaded: Seatbelt sandbox policy (Sandbox) May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: calling mpo_policy_init for Quarantine May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: Security policy loaded: Quarantine policy (Quarantine) May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: Copyright (c) 1982, 1986, 1989, 1991, 1993 May 20 06:53:00 localhost kernel[0]: The Regents of the University of California.

This is Mac OS X Lion, 10.7.4, running on an iMac mid 2011 (iMac 12,2)  thanks.  <answer91893> The errors I can see in that log are to do with kexts (kernel extensions).  Try booting in Safe Mode (described in Apple's HT1564): hold down shift during boot.  The machine will then only load certain kernel extensions.  If this results in less errors in the log, then there might be a problem with the kernel extensions cache (which I believe is bypassed in Safe Mode: see TS1884, although this is only marked as relevant to 10.5).  If there does seem to be a problem with the kext cache, then I believe you can safely delete code/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches//code and it will be rebuilt, as this superuser.com question and answer explain.  But I would do a little more research in that scenario to check first, since that question is about 10.6.  <comment59111> I'm no Unix expert, but chances are you can ignore these errors if you're not experiencing any symptoms - log files containing stuff about a failure isn't necessarily an actual problem. The SMC one seems to be discussed here as a "benign" error: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3940135?start=15&tstart=0
