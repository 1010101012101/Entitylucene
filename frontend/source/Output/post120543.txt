iOS7 iPhone: how to make Siri-initiated calls, SMS text msgs come from Google Voice caller ID? <body> When I ask Siri (iOS 7.0.4 on my iPhone 5S) to call or text someone, I want said call or text to come from my Google Voice caller ID.  Any way to do this now that jailbreak apps GVIntegrated &amp; Phone GV Extension appear to no longer be available (at least for my phone, details below)?  All other Google Voice functionality seems to be handled just fine via the Google Voice "standard" app from Google.  I've jailbroken said phone searching for a way, with no success.  GVIntegrated indeed reads "not certified on this device" and Phone GV Extension doesn't even come up in the search list on Cydia.  Phone GV Extension worked well on my iPhone 4S running 5.x (and maybe 6.x), although my iPhone seemed to be a bit less stable (reboot/crashes) in jailbroken mode.  <answer136913> I just found Call on GV Pro (jailbreak needed) that works on iOS 7.1.2  <answer214464> This is not possible at te moment.  <comment150381> After more than a month, no suggestions.  Apparently nothing exists for iOS7... (?)
