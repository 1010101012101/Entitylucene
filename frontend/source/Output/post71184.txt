How can I use command+tab to switch between windows of the same app in addition to all the other apps? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Best app to switch between all open windows (alternatives to Witch)       I would like to see all the windows, including from the same app, when I switch between them (command+tab). See an example from Ubuntu (image attached).  I know this may raise an issue of distinguishing between the same app windows. For that, there is a solution - a preview and the title of the window - see Ubuntu's static switcher (image attached).  I know the preview feature (F3 or fn+F3) but I can't continue choosing the right app using the keyboard and it's way slower than command+tab.  Thanks.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4QEP6.png" alt="Ubuntu&#39;s static app switcher"  <answer71186> What you are trying to achieve is not provided by OS X and I don't know if a third-party application would be able to interfere this deeply in the window management.  You have two options:  ol li(kbd&#x21E7;/kbd +) kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2192;/kbd to switch between apps/li li(kbd&#x21E7;/kbd +) kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd`/kbd to switch between windows of one app in one desktop/li /ol  Option two is configurable in emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Keyboard &#x2192; Keyboard &amp; Text Input &#x2192; Move focus to next Window/em.  You can still achieve something similar to what you have in Ubuntu by using Mission Control and strongnot/strong choosing the option strongGroup windows by applications/strong in:br emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Mission Control &#x2192; Group windows by applications/em  Then define a gesture to use initiate Mission Control for all individual Windows in: br emSystem Preferences &#x2192; Trackpad &#x2192; More Gestures &#x2192; Mission Control/em  Note that there is also an option for emApp Expos√©/em which is like Mission Control for just one application.  <comment82636> Whoever down votes the question, please explain, so the question could be improved. Thanks. <comment82637> BTW, I'm new to mac and trying to adapt to it (relatively successfully) but the app switching is killing me. <comment82638> I did not downvote the question, but if I were to make a guess, I think it is because of its style *"How can I make OSX behave like Ubuntu?"*. <comment82642> @gentmatt - Ubuntu is just an example, because I know it. All I want is to switch between all the windows at the same time and just applications. <comment82643> I don't understand how will this offer me an option to switch between the windows (using the keyboard) and not just between the apps. Also, I don't see the grouping option in the Preferences. <comment82649> @kilaka The answer merely says that Mission Control offers something similar and suggests using the multi-touch trackpad for navigation. The grouping option is only available in Mountain Lion (OSX 10.8). You can also use keys to initiate Mission Control in *System Preferences - Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcut - Mission Control - Mission Control* <comment82654> Why not just use Cmd + ` (Command tilde)? That's just above tab and works perfectly. <comment82720> @bassplayer7, right, it works, but not as I'd like to. If I have a task with 2 chrome Windows and a terminal, its hard to switch between the three. Especially if there are other chrome Windows that are part of another task.
