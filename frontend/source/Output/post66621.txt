How to play .wmv file with a MSS1 stream encoded? <body> Just wondering if anyone know how to play .wmv file with a MSS1 stream encoded?  <answer66624> According to this discussion, you may be able to play MSS1-encoded movies with MPlayer (Windows only). If you can wait a little while longer, VLC should gain the ability to play them in version 2.1. With VLC 2.0.3, I can at least hear the soundtrack (Codec emACELP (Sipro)/em).  <answer66649> Try MPlayerX Version 1.0.17, better support for WMV than VLC (MMS1 is ok for me).
