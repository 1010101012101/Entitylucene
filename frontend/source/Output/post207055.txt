A mysterious "Other…" user has appeared on my login screen <body> I know this is often caused by enabling the root user, but checking the Directory Utility app — as instructed in other threads on this topic — has shown me that this user isn't at all enabled.   Only software I can think of that can be responsible for this is NoMachine which I use for remote access. But I just want to rule out malware at this point and figure how the hell can I get rid of this "user" (when I click on the its avatar I'm prompted to enter both a username and a password)  <answer207070> Go into codesys prefs &gt; users &gt; login window &gt; turn off the "Text Field"/code (I'm not with my Mac at the moment so I don't know the exact wording)  <answer278097> The solution to this is to Disable Root User. To do that, go to:     System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups  Unlock Button (and put in   password)  Login Options  Network Account Server: click "Join"    Open Directory Utility  Unlock Button (and put in password)  Edit   Menu (at the top)  strongDISABLE ROOT USER/strong   Once you've done that, the Other... user should be gone from the login screen.  Alternatively, you can get to Directory Utility using Spotlight (command + spacebar) then typing Directory Utility, and pressing enter.  Hope that helps!  <comment350381> Thanks for your answer. But the Edit menu shows my root user isn't enabled. (The option is: "Enable Root User")
