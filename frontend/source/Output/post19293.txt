JarInspector not working in Lion <body> This app: http://www.codeland.org/ doesn't work in Lion.  The error is is codejarinspector[26313:707] Unable to find class: com.cgerdes.ji.JarInspectorApplication, exiting/code  Is this possible to fix, or is there and alternative app that can do the same?  I've tried JD-GUI, but the java files fails to recompile after decompiling them.  <answer35110> The FAQ, at the time of this post, claims this is fixed in the latest dev build.  But after installing it I still get the error.  <comment31466> I'm getting this as well, bit different if you run it like tihs $ open /Applications/JarInspector.app LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810 for the file /Applications/JarInspector.app. $
