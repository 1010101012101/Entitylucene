Format a SSD from Mac OS Extended to NTFS <body> I have a SSD formated in Mac OS Extended, and I want to format it to NTFS because I will use it on Windows.   To do it, I installed Paragon. I rebooted my MacBook. I checked if the driver was actived, and it was. So I went to Disk Utilty, but I have no choice to format to NTFS. Only Mac OS Extended is proposed.  I tried with Tuxera too. But same result, it didn't show the NTFS option.  Do you know any other way to format a SSD or a HDD from Mac OS Extended to NTFS ?  <answer207591> I respond to myself because I managed to do it. On my SSD I had an installation of OS X Yosemite, so I couldn't format it directly to NTFS.  So I first format the SSD to Mac OS Extended. And then I could choose the NTFS format option from Disk Utility.  <comment250442> Why don't you format the disk from the Windows side? <comment250489> The thing is I will use the ssd on a new pc, and install windows on it. So I don't have windows yet. But I managed to do it, I posted an answer
