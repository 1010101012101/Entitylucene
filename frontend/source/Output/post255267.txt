How to prevent an app from seizing foreground and keyboard focus? <body> My greatest frustration with Mac OS is that while I am typing, another process seizes the foreground and the keyboard focus.  Annoying enough in the Terminal or an editor, but truly exasperating when entering a password into a form field.  Are there settings to control this behavior?  Fine-grained would be best of course, but anything would be an improvement.
