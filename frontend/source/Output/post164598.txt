How can I connect multiple wireless headphones to the same Iphone 6 at the same time? <body> I like to listen to audio files on my Iphone 6 while jogging outdoors.  My girlfriend wants to join me (jog with me and have her own headphones listening to the same audio).  How can we emboth/em pair our wireless headphones to my Iphone simultaneously so that we're listening to exactly the same thing?  (And these audio files are not available in some shared location like Spotify.)  (Also, we own a headphone splitter, but using wired headphones is inconvenient since cords make running difficult.)  <answer164602> That would be difficult for the conditions described.  Looking for most portable solution,I think this BT splitter might do the job.  http://www.solveyourtech.com/can-two-bluetooth-devices-connected-iphone/  <answer165200> While it is true that there is no built-in supported method for an iPhone to connect to multiple sets of bluetooth speakers, it is possible to do so.  You would need to get an additional device, a Bluetooth splitter. They generally plug in to the headphone jack, and will connect to at least 2 devices. Likely more finicky than using just an iPhone, but possible. Here is one example.  <answer167247> MyStream is an app that lets you share that music wirelessly to your friend's iDevice so you can both listen to the same music at the same time.  <answer222649> I just stumbled across this after looking at the JBL Synchros E40BT over the ear headphones sold at Crutchfield.  It looks like you are basically just pairing one set to the iPhone/ipod etc.  But, the headphones allow you to pair a "secondary" set to the first.  The primary set controls the music but the second pair hears exactly what the first is hearing.  <answer235306> I just bought two SkyGenius over ear headphones on amazon, you can connect two SkyGenius headphones to one iPhone without any splitter, they name this function ‘ShareMe’, you can make the two headphones pairing first, and then pair one of them to your iPhone, then the two headphones can listen simultaneously.  <answer240531> There is another "workaround" that DOESN'T involve Bluetooth. I often train multiple students students for 5K's, 10K's, etc. Since I train multiple students at a time and often use 1-hr long DJ mixes to set paces for everyone, I connect my iPhone to an FM broadcast device (usually limited from a 30-100 feet range). I additionally, I encourage trainees to use wireless devices such as nano shuffles, etc. that can pick up radio FM frequencies. There's no pesky Bluetooth "pairing" compatibility issues and anybody can join in by simply tuning in to my FM frequency; even those with nothing more than a simple portable radio/MP3 player. Although these devices were originally intended for tuning into your car radio, I've found they work just as well as for other mobile devices that can receive radio FM frequencies. They're not that expensive, either.  http://goo.gl/01NquK  <comment193019> I'm not 100% certain, but they call it 'pairing' for a reason - one device, one headset; one pair. <comment193023> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144985/how-to-listen-to-the-same-song-at-the-same-time-on-2-different-iphones?rq=1 <comment317189> Any solution for the new iPhone/iPad without the 30 pin plug? <comment318251> The link seems to be for the transmitter. Do you have a link for the (inexpensive) FM receivers you use?
