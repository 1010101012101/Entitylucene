How can I enable SSH without using the gui or apple script on snow leopard? <body> A while back here How can I enable Internet sharing without using the GUI or AppleScript? I asked if any one knows how to enable Internet sharing without using GUI or apple script, I still have that problem but I thought this one should be easier, I want to be able to SSH into my machine but sure enough I can't go to the "sharing" pane in the Preferences (It crashes). How can I start sshd?   <answer13113> Here's the command to start VNC sharing -- not SSH, but perhaps it will help you (be sure to replace the password with your own!):  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -activate -configure -access -on -clientopts -setvnclegacy -vnclegacy yes -clientopts -setvncpw -vncpw PutYourOwnPasswordHere -restart -agent -privs -all /code/pre  Then you should be able to log in using a VNC client with the password you specified.  Here's the command to stop sharing:  precodesudo /System/Library/CoreServices/RemoteManagement/ARDAgent.app/Contents/Resources/kickstart -deactivate -configure -access -off /code/pre  Note that the Sharing pane will NOT show that sharing is active when you turn it on this way via the command line!

Does the system.log tell you anything useful? <comment13901> Wow! @Austin that works, thank you, do you happen to know tho answer to my original question too? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11855/how-can-i-enable-internet-sharing-without-using-the-gui-or-apple-script-on-snow-l <comment14003> I took a crack at it.  Hope it helps! <comment181014> Thanks. Also is there a way to add remove users who can ssh. You know in the UI you can choose who can use the "remote login".
