Any productivity tip for using OS X with only one arm, like Windows its sticky key? <body> Google mostly returns Apple's accessibility API and other programming resources.  But I'd want to know, for example, what is Mac OS X version 10.7.4 equivalent of 'sticky key' in Windows.  Any other productivity tip for using OS X with only one arm?  <answer55778> In strongSystem Preferences/strong, click strongUniversal Access/strong then strongKeyboard/strong:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DuO2J.png" alt="enter image description here"  You'll find the options for sticky keys in there.  <answer81528> Something I find very useful when on one arm (and when on two) is these:  ul lictrl-a/e = jump to start/end of line/li lictrl-j/d = one line up/down/li lictrl-k = kill line from pointer to end of line/li lictrl-d = delete/li /ul  They're maybe more useful if you're using you left arm, since you can then do most of them with your left pinky on ctrl.  For adding custom commands I recommend BetterTouchTool.  <comment93984> May I also suggest http://www.matias.ca/halfkeyboard/index.php
