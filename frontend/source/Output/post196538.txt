Cannot delete windows partition from mac <body> I want to remove Windows from Mac and the I know the simple way is through the Boot Camp Assistant. But that doesn't work for me as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rHx3J.jpg" alt="the remove button is greyed out"  However, when I try to merge the partition of windows through disk utility, all buttons are inactive, and I cannot press either '-' or 'option' button, like follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Txpff.jpg" alt="cannot merge the partition"   Then, I try to reinstall a new Mac osX from the internet by pressing and holding the [command]+[alt]+[R] when starting the computer, and it doesn't work either. I am informed that the system cannot be installed in either the BOOTCAMP partition or Untitled partition since they are not GUID partition table format.  I am a newer to Mac and I just want to delete the Windows partition and add the space back to my osX partition. I wonder what should I do next?   Thanks for help!  <answer196553> First of all, try both repair disk (if grayed, then verify), and repair disk permissions. If you are still unable, boot to single-user mode (kbdCommand /kbd+kbdS /kbd on boot) and type in the following.  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /code/pre  Press enter, then type reboot.  If it still does not work, then do the following, but be sure to backup:  Hold kbdCommand /kbd+kbdR /kbd on boot to start Recovery mode, select disk utility and do it from there. If it is grayed out, select the partition scheme to 1 (or 2 if you need Untitled)  hr  h2Warning:/h2 There have been reports that setting the partition scheme to 1 or 2 can erase all your data. Be sure to backup before attempting to do this.  <answer247006> Okay, so when I had a similar problem, I used Terminal, these two guides, and this command line to get it done.  precodediskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ NewName {first disk identifier in range} {last disk identifier in range} /code/pre  I used codediskutil list/code to make sure I knew which drives I was merging, because you can't use the Disk Utility names (Macintosh HD, BOOTCAMP), you need the disk identifier (which looks like disk0, disk0s1, disk0s2, etc). I'm going to strongemguess/em/strong your HD would be disk0s2 and the BC is disk0s3, if that were true the next thing you'd put into Terminal is:  precodediskutil mergePartitions JHFS+ NewName disk0s2 disk0s3 /code/pre  The codeJHFS+/code will reformat the Windows drive when it merges and codeNewName/code should be replaced with whatever you wanna name your HD.  Mind you, doing the above should leave you with 2 partitions: NewName and Untitled. If you wanted to merge all three partitions then you would use HD and Untitled in your command line.  <answer280847> Be careful  diskutil mergePartitions  is very powerful -- if you have segment A and C and merge them it gets rid of B (merges that too) -- and other very funky repercussions. So be careful.  It ultimately helped me get rid of the xfat partition but it was tricky.   <comment304716> If you go so far as to select the entire device, then take this advice to set it to 1 partition and apply it, *you will lose the entire drive*. <comment304750> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment304752> Good to know, thanks. <comment305716> @RayJunior I will add that, if there's a risk. It always worked for me.
