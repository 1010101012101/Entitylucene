com.apple.quarantine extended attribute gets re-added each time I open the file <body> I have a file called tasks.taskpaper that I associated with FoldingText. When I open the file, the dialog pops up with text     “tasks.taskpaper” may be a script application. It was created by   FoldingText and will be opened by FoldingText. Are you sure you want   to open it?   And, indeed, the com.apple.quarantine extended attribute is associated with the file:  precode$ xattr -l tasks.taskpaper | grep com.apple.quarantine com.apple.quarantine: 0002;53b0afc9;FoldingText; /code/pre  I can remove the attribute:  precode$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine tasks.taskpaper $ xattr -l tasks.taskpaper | grep com.apple.quarantine $ /code/pre  But when I open the file with FoldingText again, I get the popup dialog again, and the attribute has somehow been re-added to the file:  precode$ xattr -l tasks.taskpaper | grep com.apple.quarantine com.apple.quarantine: 0002;53b0b0dc;FoldingText; /code/pre  How can I get this to stop happening?  Note that I'm running on Mavericks and I installed FoldingText (2.0.2) using the App Store. Also, the file is in a Dropbox directory.  <answer136529> You need to add emthe direct path to the file/em  in your command to remove it permanently:  precodexattr -d com.apple.quarantine /complete/path/to/tasks.taskpaper /code/pre  If this fails, there may be multiple instances. Attempt to globally remove it amongst all versions:  precodefind . -iname '*.taskpaper' -print0 | xargs -0 xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /code/pre
