How to keep default keyboard shortcut in parallel with custom shortcut <body> OS X Terminal uses kbd⌘⇧}/kbd and kbd⌘⇧{/kbd for next and previous tab keyboard shortcuts, respectively, the same way that browsers do. However, browsers (at least, Chrome and Safari) also use kbd⌃⇥/kbd and kbd⌃⇧⇥/kbd for the same purpose. I often find myself trying to use one of the tab-based shortcuts in Terminal, which of course does not work.   I used Keyboard Shortcuts preferences to add custom shortcuts for the next and previous tab menu items, mapping them to the tab-based shortcuts, which worked fine. Doing so, however, disabled the curly-bracket-based shortcuts, which I also sometimes use.  How can I add the tab-based shortcuts while also keeping the default curly-bracket-based shortcuts, so that either will work, like they do in browsers?  <comment284898> never tried it, but what about adding the default back as a custom too? idk if it will fight you, or just let you but worth a shot. <comment284907> Just gave it a shot – seems like keyboard shortcuts for menu items of the same name silently fail to be added. Good idea though! <comment284915> ah, shame :/ Was worth a quick shot. <comment327559> This is not an answer for my original question, but note that Terminal on macOS Sierra now accepts both of these keyboard shortcuts to change tabs by default.
