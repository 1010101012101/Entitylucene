Fixing up a HFS+ filesystem enough to rescue some files <body> I have a HFS+ formatted drive that just died on me. I have a back up but it's a about a week old. Unfortunately, I have a few files that I've changed and added since then that I would like to rescue before throwing it out.  Running fsck on it gives this output:  precodetangrs:~ new_tangrs$ sudo fsck_hfs -d /dev/disk1s2 Password: journal_replay(/dev/disk1s2) returned 0 ** /dev/rdisk1s2     Using cacheBlockSize=32K cacheTotalBlock=32768 cacheSize=1048576K.

When I try to mount it, it just kicks me out with a weird error message.  precodetangrs:~ new_tangrs$ sudo mount -o ro -t hfs /dev/disk1s2 /Volumes/HDD mount_hfs: No such file or directory tangrs:~ new_tangrs$ sudo dmesg | tail hfs_mountfs: encountered failure 2  hfs_mount: hfs_mountfs returned 2 hfs_mounthfsplus: cat_idlookup returned (2) getting rootfolder  hfs_mounthfsplus: encountered errorr (2) hfs_mountfs: encountered failure 2  hfs_mount: hfs_mountfs returned 2 hfs_mounthfsplus: cat_idlookup returned (2) getting rootfolder  hfs_mounthfsplus: encountered errorr (2) hfs_mountfs: encountered failure 2  hfs_mount: hfs_mountfs returned 2 tangrs:~ new_tangrs$ /code/pre  Can anyone help out here?  <answer79159> Disk warrior has saved my bacon more than once:  http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/  <answer79201> I am new here and also to the mac world. Please try www.krollontrack.com who have mac recovery software. They are great in the pc world. Also, try a disk copier to make a bit copy of the old disk to a new one and try recovery from them.  <comment91297> If I were you, I'd stop doing anything that can potentially write data to your disk until you can make a byte-for-byte image of it. Then mess around with fsck / data recovery. <comment91312> @tangrs And [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050302225659382) is a guide on how to copy data byte-for-byte. <comment91542> I borrowed a copy of this off my friend and ran it on a duplicate image. Unfortunately, the filesystem was so messed up, it couldn't recover much. Still, I got a few files that I needed. Thanks <comment235128> Any recovery software that doesn't come with a free trial, does not inspire buying confidence.  I would personally recommend trying http://www.plop.at/en/hfsprescue.html if you are comfortable compiling it yourself.
