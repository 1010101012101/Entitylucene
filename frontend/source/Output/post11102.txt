Using Automator to obtain content from multiple webpages? <body> I'd like to use Apple's Automator to obtain content from multiple webpages. The webpages each contain links, text, and photos. I would then like to place this information in a text document.   Detailed steps would be much appreciated!  Thanks for your help!  <answer11131> Automator, as an automation tool, is a bit of a sledgehammer, so the following is a bit clumsy, but works.  Automator provides two actions for choosing URLs: strongGet Specified URLs/strong, that allows one to specify a pre-determined list of URLs, and strongGet Current Webpage from Safari/strong, that specifies the URL of Safari's current webpage. It also provides three nice actions for parsing we webpages: strongGet Text from Webpage/strong, strongGet Image URLs from Webpage/strong and strongGet Link URLs from Webpages/strong, which do what you would expect them to. Finally, Automator provides an action to place text in a document: strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong. You may also want to use the strongGet Specified Text/strong action to separate the text, images, and links sections of your new TextEdit Document.  Here is what your complete Automator workflow might look like:  strongGet Specified Text/strong code--- Text of Webpage ---/code  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by replacing" option.  strongGet Current Webpage from Safari/strong  strongGet Text from Webpage/strong  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by emappending/em" option.  strongGet Specified Text/strong code--- Images URLs of Webpage ---/code  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by appending" option.  strongGet Current Webpage from Safari/strong  strongGet Image URLs from Webpage/strong  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by appending" option.  strongGet Specified Text/strong code--- Link URLs of Webpage ---/code  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by appending" option.  strongGet Current Webpage from Safari/strong  strongGet Link URLs from Webpages/strong  strongSet Contents of TextEdit Document/strong using the "by appending" option.  When this workflow finishes, there will be a new untitled TextEdit document open whose contents is text, image URLs and link URLs of Safari's current webpage. You can save it wherever you please.
