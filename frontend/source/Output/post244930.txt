How do I view inline images in w3m? <body> I am using a mac (el capitan), and trying to use w3m. But I don't see images when browsing pages.    hr     My question is: I want to view inline images in w3m, but don't find a way to do so.     I have been told that w3m can display inline images, and seen some video examples. But all the tutorials I found use linux or the like, and I can't seem to make w3m display inline images.br I opened w3m in a terminal (either xterm or iterm2), and pressed o and set the codedisplay inline image/code option to yes, and re-launches w3m, but nothing happens.br Some say that one should install w3m-img, but I cannot find a package named as such.br Others say that one should enable frame buffer; however, I don't know how to do that.    Any help or reference is sincerely thanked.    hr  strongP.S./strongbr In item2 i can display images on the terminal, but, when using w3m, still no images appear.
