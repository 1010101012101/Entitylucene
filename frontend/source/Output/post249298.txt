Why is my terminal displaying my IP address beside my name? <body> Well, I was just wondering if it is okay for the OS X shell to display something like this:   precode192-168-1-7:~ name$  /code/pre  What does the above actually mean? I have tried setting my host name but still didn't work!   And the Terminal window is name is codename--- bash ---80x24/code What does that mean?  Thank you   <answer249301> The bash interactive shell prompt - if not tweeked further - is determined by the PS1-line in the file /etc/bashrc.  The 6th line codePS1='\h:\W \u\$ '/code decodes to  ul licode\h/code the hostname up to the first `.' - in your case strong192-168-1-7/strong/li licode:/code delimiter/li licode\W/code the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde - in your case strong~/strong which is equivalent to the directory /Users/name//li licode/code delimiter/space/li licode\u/code short user name of the current user - in your case strongname/strong/li licode$/code UserID-identifier (it turns to a # if the effective UID is 0 (~root) - else $)/li licode/code delimiter/space/li /ul  A longer list of possible customizations of the prompt (e.g. time, date, bell) will be shown after opening Terminal.app, entering codeman bash/code and going down to PROMPTING.  hr  The Terminal window title shows your working directory, the name of your shell  (bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell) and its size: 80 characters x 24 lines.  hr  Your fully qualified host name is probably 192-168-1-7.SLD.TLD (e.g. 192-168-1-7.dlink.home) and is assigned by a DHCP server in your network. Considering all that your Terminal window name and the embedded shell prompt is completely regular.  <comment309184> Isn't that where the shell would normally put the name of the computer?  Maybe it did not figure out a computer name, so it used the IP address as a default. <comment309185> bash is the name of the shell being used.   80x24 means the terminal is set to 24 lines of 80 characters each. <comment309186> Type `echo $PS1`  as well as `uname -n` and post the output.
