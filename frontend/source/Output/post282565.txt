System Preferences shows one notification on the Dock but I cannot find it once insideâ€¦ <body> My dock started showing a single notification strong(1)/strong in a red circle as on attached screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M3Z1E.png" alt="enter image description here"  The point is that I can't find it on System Preferences panel. Any clue how to check what is it and how to mark it as "seen"?  emmacOS Sierra 10.12.4/em  Edit: if that can help - I don't have any available updates in App Store.
