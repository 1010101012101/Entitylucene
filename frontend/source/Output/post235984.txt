Hacking Preview in Mac OS X <body> For certain PDFs with graphics split over two pages, it is best to view them side-by-side.   Apple's Preview app lets me view two pages side-by-side. This is great!   The only problem is that it's off by one page. For example, if the intended view is the following:  precode ___________________ | Banner T|ext Here | |         |         | |  34     |     35  | |         |         | |_________|___ _____| /code/pre  what Preview shows is this:  precode ___________________ |         | Banner T| |         |         | |     33  |  34     | |         |         | |_________|___ _____|  &lt;followed by&gt;  ___________________ |ext Here |         | |         |         | |     35  |  36     | |         |         | |_________|___ _____| /code/pre  I realize that Apple's choice for Two Page viewing mode is probably optimal for many (most?) situations, but not for mine.   strongIs there a way to change this behavior--preferably on a per-document basis, but even via an obscure setting somewhere?/strong   (In Windows, Adobe Acrobat displays the pages "correctly". I realize I could just download Adobe Acrobat for Mac, but I'm curious if this can be done in Preview.)   <answer235985> A simple solution is add a blank page next to the first page of the document. So it shifts all pages. Use it from codeEdit/code  codeInsert Blank Page/code.
