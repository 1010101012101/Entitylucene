"on my mac" calendar option missing from New Calendar menu <body> I recently did a clean install of Mountain Lion (upgrading from Lion). Exported my calendars to a "Calendar Archive" on Lion and then imported them on Mountain Lion.  Maybe I broke something, but I don't see a way to add new calendars "on my mac". The only option i have in File | New Calendar is "iCloud" (which is not what i want). Is there a preference I'm missing somewhere?  A possibly related problem: syncing with iCloud seems to be broken. I get a triangle alert icon to show there has been a problem (but there is no clue what the problem is). I spent and hour on Google hunting but couldn't find a place to look for logged error messages.  <answer62397> Apparently you'll have to:  ol listrongDisable/strong iCloud by going to strongCalendar  Preferences  Accounts/strong. It seems important just to disable iCloud from Calendar's preferences, not completely sign out of it from within emSystem Preferences/em./li liCreate a new calendar which name does not conflicts with any calendars you've already got in your iCloud./li liEnable your iCloud account./li /ol  This will make the new calendar, under emOn My Mac/em to remain.   <comment72263> Brilliant. Thank you. Worked perfectly.
