How do I detect malware and remove it from iPad? <body> I was an idiot, clicked on a zip file from a scam (notice to appearing court). How do I know if the malware did in fact get installed and if it did, how do I get rid of it?  <answer181523> You haven't got malware on your iPad. To extract zip files, you need a third-party app and this app's data will be contained within the sandbox of that app.
