Mavericks - terminal change default printer paper size <body> I've been using the following terminal command to set the current default printer paper size to a custom paper size    precodedefaults write com.apple.print.PrintingPrefs DefaultPaperID -string 154x216 /code/pre  Unfortunately looking in preferences panel this is not setting the paper size, please does anyone know where this default paper is now set in Mavericks  <answer107802> The setting in System Preferences changes the DefaultPaperID key in code~/Library/Preferences/org.cups.PrintingPrefs.plist/code. Try to change that key instead:  precodedefaults write org.cups.PrintingPrefs DefaultPaperID 154x216 /code/pre  Quit and reopen applications to apply the changes.   codedefaults read com.apple.print.custompapers/code shows the IDs of custom paper sizes.  <comment126410> just missed it from my code entered here, i'll edit thanks
