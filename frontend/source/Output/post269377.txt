MacBook Pro 15" Touch Bar running hot <body> I just got a MBP 15" Touch Bar with sierra.  I am using it for web development (Webstorm) and graphic design (Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer). When using the graphic design tools, my MBP can start getting hot... up to 88°C. Now this happens with within 30 minutes or more of using the software. I have to stop my work and wait for it to cool off.   I have even put my Mac to sleep and went to the store and when I came back my Mac was pretty hot. It seems like sleep mode did not work.  Keyboard lite was on when I got back from the store.  I put it to sleep again and the same behavior happened.  I also have a 2015 MacBook Pro 15" and it does not run as hot as the latest 2016 MBPs. Am I missing something?  Is this normal for new MacBooks?   I have checked the apple pages for temperatures but they only provide ENVIRONMENT temperatures and that is it.   <answer269384> The normal operating temperature range for silicon is much higher than is comfortable to the touch.  The heatsinks &amp; fans are directly below the top of the keyboard along the hinge opening.  I too have found the upper edge of my MBP to be uncomfortable to touch -- typically when I'm debugging using the F() keys.    My recommendation would be to use a product that allows you to manually adjust the fan speed in order to run the fan at a higher-than-minimally-necessary speed to lower the temperatures accordingly.  I personally use iStat Menus.  In that tool, under 'sensors' is a button to 'Edit Fan Rules'.  <answer269413> The first things I would do are to reset both the NVRAM and SMC. Follow the steps below.  strongReset the NVRAM/strong  strongIMPORTANT:/strong The steps for resetting the NVRAM are different for the Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (i.e. different to all other Macs).   For all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong /li listrongKeep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!/strong/li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongReset the SMC/strong  You should also try resetting the SMC. To do this on your MBP, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongHow does your temperature compare?/strong  Once you've reset both the NVRAM and SMC, your MBP emshould/em behave how Apple intended. If you still experience temperatures of 88º C and are concerned by this, you can use this resource (which can be filtered) to compare temperature readings with other users. Of course, I'm not sure how many users with Late-2016 MBPs have recorded their temperatures yet.  However, my earlier MBP temp is regularly at 81º C and it performs very well!  strongDo you have a problem?/strong  Another thing you can do is run Apple Hardware Diagnostics to see if it finds any errors. To do this:  ol liFully shut down your MBP/li liRestart your MBP/li liImmediately press the kbdD/kbd key and strongkeep it down/strong until you see the Diagnostics screen appear/li liWait for Diagnostics to finish (this typically only takes a few minutes)/li liOnce complete, one of two things will appear on the screen:  ul lia emNo issues found/em message/li lia brief description of any errors found plus further instructions/li /ul/li liIf the diagnostics test does find errors, take a note of what they are/li /ol  strongNote:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead. This will try and run diagnostics from the internet instead, so you will need to allow more time for it to complete.  Let us know how you go.  <comment339116> So sad that I have to buy extra software to keep my MBP from getting very HOT.  I tried using iStat Menus and so far it is working well.  I have my settings at medium but on gaming it still gets very very very HOT. <comment339279> @btinoco - I agree wholeheartedly!  I've been keeping an eye out for something that would just allow me to adjust the target temperature used by the smc, but so far, nada.  Also, I commonly 5 different fan presets, based on the amount of cooling I need and the noise I can stand in a particular environment.  It's not uncommon for me to use both fans on High to get the desired cooling if my CPU is busy (say, running 2 VM android emulators, for instance.)
