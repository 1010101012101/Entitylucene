Rig multiple iPads to display a running screen <body> I want to create a rectangular display of iPads connected to a computer. Preferably the iPads would be able to display some message running across the screen of all of them, but if that isn't possible, then just every single iPad displaying the same message and changing when necessary.  <comment312518> That's a very interesting idea.  I don't see a question here, though.  Take a look at [ask] on the best way to ask a question.  You can then edit your question to focus on the 1 issue you need help with.  Be sure to include what steps you've already taken (assuming you're not asking us to do all the research work for you) as well as any error messages you've received.
