Unable to use WiFi after/during using thunderbolt ethernet adapter <body> when I use my thunderbolt ethernet adapter I'm not able to connect to the WiFi, either when the adapter is plugged or not.  I tried to check for errors in code/var/logs/wifi/code and I got this:  precodeWed Apr 26 16:43:34.667 &lt;kernel&gt; en0: Terminating supplicant.

For example, are you able to turn Wi-Fi off and on again, or is it totally greyed out/unresponsive? Does it look like it's trying to connect to Wi-Fi or not? Or, do you mean it actually _does_ connect to Wi-Fi, but that it's not getting an internet connection? Also, what version of macOS are you running? <comment355107> Can you confirm/clarify when you say you can't *connect to the WiFi, either when the adapter is plugged or not?*  Are you unplugging Ethernet from the adapter, or the adapter from the MBP?  Can you provide a scenario where WiFi actually works? <comment355265> I had internet sharing enabled, so when I plugged the adapter the wifi would disconnect and start sharing the connection. After that moment when I tried to connect to any other wifi it work work. I tried removing the adapter but it was still not working. I had to restart my laptop to make it work. I have disabled internet sharing and it seems to work. Will let you know if I still get the issue.
