iTunes Helper still running even if it is off <body> I want to disable iTunes Helper.  I have remove it from codeSettings &gt; Users &amp; Groups &gt; Login Items/code, but it's still running after restart.  Did I miss anything?  <answer91713> iTunesHelper will run if you open iTunes, or do something that opens an iTunes service.  The only way to completely disable iTunesHelper is toâ€¦  ol liQuit iTunes and remove iTunesHelper from Login Items./li liGo to code/Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS//code ul liYou can use Finder's Go to Folder to go there - paste in the path as above./li /ul/li liRename iTunesHelper.app to something else (e.g. iTunesHelper-disabled.app)./li /ol  iTunesHelper should not run automatically now.  <comment107739> It worked (or not)! Thanks! <comment354536> Using this method, you will get an occasional warning that iTunesHelper can not be found (at least for me on Sierra).
