Why I am unable to switch bash to the one installed by homebrew? <body> I'm trying to update bash to version 4.x. I did brew upgrade, then brew update, then brew install bash. I ran codesudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/bin/bash &gt;&gt; /etc/shells"/code and codesudo bash -c "echo /usr/local/bin/bash &gt;&gt; /private/etc/shells"/code. I've tried symlinking /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.3.32/bin/bash to /usr/local/bin/bash. I've closed Terminal.app. I've even logged out of Mac completely. Nothing I do has updated $BASH_VERSION to the right thing. codebash --version/code does say the right thing, but I think I read somewhere that that is less reliable then codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code (maybe). Here's a summary of what I'm seeing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UrIml.png" alt="enter image description here"  I just need to know . . . what version of bash am I actually on? And if it's not 4.x, how do I emreliably, definitively/em make it that?  I am on Yosemite FWIW.  Edit:  $PATH was too long for a comment. Here it is:  precode/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/bin:/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin:/usr/local/heroku/bin:/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/Cellar/grep/2.18/bin:/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/local/heroku/bin:/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/Cellar/grep/2.18/bin:/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin:/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin:~/activator:/Users/AndrewNichols/sonarqube-4.5/bin/macosx-universal-64:/Users/AndrewNichols/sonar-runner-2.4/bin:/Users/AndrewNichols/bin:~/activator:/Users/AndrewNichols/sonarqube-4.5/bin/macosx-universal-64:/Users/AndrewNichols/sonar-runner-2.4/bin:/Users/AndrewNichols/bin:/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/bin /code/pre  Here's one split on colon, for readability:  precode'/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/bin', '/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1@global/bin', '/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.1.1/bin', '/usr/local/heroku/bin', '/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin', '/usr/local/Cellar/grep/2.18/bin', '/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin', '/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin', '/usr/local/bin', '/usr/bin', '/bin', '/usr/sbin', '/sbin', '/opt/X11/bin', '/usr/local/heroku/bin', '/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin', '/usr/local/Cellar/grep/2.18/bin', '/usr/local/opt/gnu-sed/libexec/gnubin', '/usr/local/opt/gnu-tar/libexec/gnubin', '~/activator', '/Users/AndrewNichols/sonarqube-4.5/bin/macosx-universal-64', '/Users/AndrewNichols/sonar-runner-2.4/bin', '/Users/AndrewNichols/bin', '~/activator', '/Users/AndrewNichols/sonarqube-4.5/bin/macosx-universal-64', '/Users/AndrewNichols/sonar-runner-2.4/bin', '/Users/AndrewNichols/bin', '/Users/AndrewNichols/.rvm/bin' /code/pre  Some of the duplication there is because I have terminal set to run tmux on startup, so .bashrc gets sourced twice.  <answer221946> This should fix your issue.  precodemv /bin/bash /bin/bash3  /code/pre  and then create a symlink to   precodeln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash /code/pre  That should fix your issue.  <answer222045> Okay, so apparently this was happening because tmux was holding on to the original bash version (even though I had exited tmux and reloaded it's config). codetmux kill-server/code followed by relaunching tmux fixed it for me.  <comment268789> Where and how did you change the login shell for your user account? <comment268790> `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash`. Basically as described [here](https://gist.github.com/samnang/1759336). <comment268830> I'm not an expert, but that sounds like a really bad idea. Actually, I'm pretty sure this is impossible with SIP on 10.11 and later. <comment268850> what is the output of `echo $PATH`? <comment268912> @njboot - See my edits above. <comment268913> Well, I'm on Yosemite, so SIP isn't necessarily a problem. But it does sound dodgy either way. I felt weird enough moving /usr/local/bin/bash to /usr/local/bin/bash.bak so I could symlink the homebrew one.
