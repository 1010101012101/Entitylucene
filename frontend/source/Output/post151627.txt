MacBook Pro Retina problems Wifi connection <body> i recently bought a power Mac but it recognizes my dedicated wifi but when I got to open a window no connection. And that's when it connects on wifi after many attempts.  My iPhone and iPad are working online fine.  I am using xfinity as my internet provider.  Any help?
