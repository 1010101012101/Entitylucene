How do I re-associate HTTP links with my browser in OS X? <body> I installed iTerm2 the other day, and was playing around with it. In the process I seemed to have messed up the handling of HTTP hyperlinks on my system. Sometimes (annoyingly, not every time, which is emvery/em confusing - I can't spot a pattern) when I click an HTTP link in the Twitter app, MS Word, and so on, it opens a new iTerm2 terminal window or tab, and the webpage doesn't open. How can I get back to the original behavior and have the link open in the default web browser?  I've already checked the iTerm2 preferences - under "URL schemes", no scheme is selected:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GYlHz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer193421> Check the file associations for both HTTP &amp; HTTPS, make sure both are set to Safari.  A simple way to do this would be using RCDefaultApp  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o4iYz.png" alt="enter image description here"  sub Answered as Community Wiki just so we don't have a dangling question when there's a perfectly good answer in the comments. /sub  <answer193435> Set Safari to be your default web browser.  <comment93548> Try to reassign the URL schemes using [RCDefaultApp](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/). <comment93555> If there is an entry for it in `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist`, try deleting it and restarting. <comment93569> Lauri, your answer worked. https (not http) was associated with iTerm2, not Safari - hence the "random" behavior. I've fixed that now. If you change your comment to an answer, I can mark it. <comment107192> Andrew, could you copypaste the solution to an answer and mark the question as solve, please? I'd rather not steal Lauri's reputation but it's preferable you get it than I do. <comment230570> How do you do that?
