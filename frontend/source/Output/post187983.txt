sudo killall coreaudiod MAde it so I don't have any volume at all <body> I ran into an issue where my volume buttons on my mac weren't able to adjust the volume of my computer. I sought a solution and someone suggested using codesudo killall coreaudiod/code. Now I have no volume on my computer at all. How do I fix this?  <answer188139> You've simply killed Core Audio, which will restart itself if you restart your computer. Try logging out/in, and if that doesn't work restart your computer.  <answer246514> You need to reload codecoreaudiod/code instead of killing it. This one-liner will fix broken sound without restarting your mac  codesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist &amp;&amp; sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist/code  <comment222371> Have you restarted your machine? <comment222580> restarting the machine works. Thank you. <comment222584> You can start `coreaudiod`with this command: `sudo launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.audio.coreaudiod.plist`. <comment338864> I can't believe I have to do this several times a day.
