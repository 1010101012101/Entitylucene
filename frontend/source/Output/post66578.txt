Can Mac App Store purchased apps install Quicklook Plugins? <body> Since all apps are now sandboxed when purchased from the Mac App Store, what does this mean for the install process? Do you literally downoad the code.app/code bundle, which gets placed into code/Applications/code, and then the process is complete?  Is it possible for an application that is sandboxed to install a Quicklook Plugin for use with filetypes it supports?  <answer66585> Yes, you can add a Quicklook Plugin to an application. For example, QuickNFO uses one: QuickNFO Mac App store page  <answer66586> Yes, any application placed in the Applications folder can provide QuickLook support.  Sandboxing does not affect an application's ability to support QuickLook.  Mac OS X looks inside applications for a QuickLook plug-ins folder. The specific folder is:  precodeMyApp.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/ /code/pre  Support for Automator and Spotlight can also be provided using this per-application Library folder mechanism.  When you download an application from the Mac App Store you are still going through code/usr/bin/installer/code. The Mac App Store downloads a flat-file installer package code.pkg/code and then installs it on your behalf.  This allows the installation process to be more than just a single copy for complex applications; functionality that is only available to Apple software. For now, third party software can do no more than provide a single application to be placed within the /Applications folder.  <comment78484> Ah, I would have expected that it would only look in `/Library/QuickLook`, but looking in that directory I see fewer QLGenerators than I know I have on my system.
