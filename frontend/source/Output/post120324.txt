I lost my albums and books <body> I lost my albums and books in iPhoto and cannot retrieve them.  Is there anything I can do to retrieve these lost files?  <answer120325> If you've deleted them, you'll need to have a backup to restore the file from. If it's a laptop, hopefully you had local snapshots enabled, in which case you can go to the folder that contained your iPhoto library, enter Time Machine and restore the file.  <comment140362> What did you do to lose your Photos? It's easier to help if you describe what happened.
