Does macOS Sierra support Server Side Copy via SMB and/or AFP? <body> I'm using FreeNAS and it has the option to share data using SMB or AFP. Since I recently learned that AFP is being deprecated, I'm hesitant to use AFP but I'v read that AFP supports Server Side Copy and SMB on Mac does not.  I want to confirm both points with the Ask Different crowd:  ol liDoes macOS Sierra connecting to a FreeNAS server via AFP support Server Side Copy?/li liDoes macOS Sierra connecting to a FreeNAS server via SMB support Server Side Copy?/li /ol  Based on release notes, FreeNAS supports Samba 4.1.4 (SMB3), and thus supports Server-Side Copy when connect with compatible clients.  <answer285513> ol liUnfortunately, the source code of the AFP driver is not free software, so it's difficult to give a definitive answer on that. However, it appears that Netatalk supports copyfile, so it's likely that the answer to that question is yes./li liIf you look at the source code of the latest version of the macOS smbfs driver, you can see that it does implement the copyfile operation (see smbfs_vnop_copyfile)  According to the release notes, OS X did that since ca. 2013:     8) Added Server Side Copies (OS X SMB Client &lt;- OS X/Windows SMB File   Server)   Whether that actually gets used with FreeNAS, I cannot tell - I have no access to a FreeNAS system./li /ol  <comment360243> Strange, in my initial testing, it didn't appear to work but trying again, I can verify that server-side copy works using macOS Sierra connecting to FreeNAS via SMB.
