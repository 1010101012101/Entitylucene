Stay signed in to Find My iPhone, when the iCloud account is different <body> On my iPhone 6 I use Find My iPhone pretty often to find my iPhone 5s. iPhone 6 used to be on the same iCloud account as iPhone 5s, but I switched it to its own account. Since then, I now I have to enter my password for the iCloud account of iPhone 5s, every time I want to find iPhone 5s. (Find My iPhone automatically logs out after a few minutes of inactivity.) It's rather cumbersome to enter my password each time. Is there any way for Device A to stay signed in to Device B's iCloud account, in the Find My iPhone app?  <comment273579> Set up Family Sharing. <comment273901> That worked, thanks! I already had Family Sharing enabled, and I just had to enable location sharing under Settings  iCloud  Share My Location. Then on my iPhone 6 I signed in to Find My iPhone with its respective iCloud account.
