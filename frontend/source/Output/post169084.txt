How can I find all *old* Keynote presentations on my computer? <body> I have some old Keynote presentations. When I try to open them with the latest Keynote (6.5.2 (2119)), I get the following warning:  precodeThis presentation can’t be opened because it’s too old. To open it, save it with Keynote ’09 first. /code/pre  I've managed to get codeKeynote '09/code installed, and I can open with that, save, open with the current version, and save again.   It will be a pain to do this with all of my Keynote presentations, but it seems it has to be done if I want to be able to access them in the future. Or I should convert them to PDF so they are in a format with more long-term access options.  How do I find all of the Keynote presentations on my computer that are outdated? Is there an codemdfind/code option that will allow me to find just the old versions?  <answer169087> A Smart Folder is probably the easiest way to find all your old Keynote files. To create one:  ol liOpen a Finder Window/li liClick "File"  "New Smart Folder"/li liIn the search box, type "key" and then select "Keynote Document" from the dropdown/li liIf you like, you can add a last modified filer by clicking the "+" sign under the search box./li liIf you want to save the Smart folder, click the "Save" button/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0IzH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment198505> Doesn't this list *all* Keynote documents, old and new? <comment198506> I was counting on the date filter to eliminate the new files. It sounds like the OP just installed the new Keynote app recently. <comment198534> I've been using new Keynote for a while. Just recently realized I can't open old ones, and should update them. This isn't a complete solution, but this plus sorting by "date modified" should help me out. <comment198536> Strangely when searching I see all Keynote docs, but after saving the search and selecting it in the sidebar, nothing shows up. <comment198555> That is odd. I see the same thing on my end. The workaround that I found was to edit the Smart Folder to search for the kind of "Keynote" instead of "Keynote Document". You can do this by following the steps below:  1. Secondary click on the smart search in the finder left panel and click on "Show Search Criteria". 2. Replace "Keynote Document" with "Keynote" and Save <comment198953> I'm just using the CLI: `mdfind 'kMDItemKind = "Keynote Presentation" && kMDItemContentModificationDate  $time.today(-1)'`
