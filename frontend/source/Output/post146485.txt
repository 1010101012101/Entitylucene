Can you enable the meta key in Mavericks? <body> According to several help posts (for example), you used to be able to enable the option/alt key to act as a meta key. Can you no longer do that in Mavericks?  <answer146491> This is still possible in Mavericks. Have you looked under Terminal codePreferences &gt; Settings Tab &gt; Profiles &gt; Default Profile &gt; Keyboard/code and then ticked "Use option as meta key" at the bottom?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVGPi.png" alt="Option as Meta"  <comment172613> What do you mean by a meta key? any info should be in the question and not just a link which could break in the future <comment172819> Wow, I feel dumb. I was looking under System Preferences, not Terminal Preferences. Thanks for your help, and apologies for the silly question. <comment172855> Glad to help. It does seem kind of weird that it is a profile setting rather than a system-wide one.
