What's the best way in terminal to move a file from deep in one directory to deep into another? <body> E.g. code/desktop/a/b/c/file.txt/code and I want to move the text file to code/desktop/x/y/z//code  Thanks for any help!  <answer167519> Have you looked at the codemv/code command?  codemv /desktop/a/b/c/file.txt /desktop/x/y/z//code  will do what you want.  Read about codemv/code by typing codeman mv/code from the command prompt in Terminal.app.  <answer167584> If you are repeating the same move every time (i.e. from the same directory to the same directory), then you could create a bash shell function to greatly simplify the task.  You could edit your ~/.bash_profile file to contain the following shell function:  precodemvdeep(){   mv "~/Desktop/a/b/c/$1" "~/Desktop/x/y/z/" } /code/pre  Then, save your changes to .bash_profile, open Terminal, and run the following to load the changes:  precodesource ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  From thereafter, if you had a file called "test.txt" in the "~/Desktop/a/b/c/" directory, you could move it to the "~/Desktop/x/y/z/" directory simply by using this command in terminal:  precodemvdeep test.txt /code/pre  Search the web for "bash shell function examples" for more information about creating these for your needs.  <answer167848> If you're using the codebash/code (or similar) shell and you've visited both directories in succession, you could use the code$OLDPWD/code environment variable:  precodecd /desktop/a/b/c cd /desktop/x/y/z mv $OLDPWD/file.txt . /code/pre  or  precodecd /desktop/x/y/z cd /desktop/a/b/c mv file.txt $OLDPWD/. /code/pre  <comment196396> Thanks!  I was also curious though if there was perhaps a more efficient way of doing so (say I need to go deep into both directories - is that still my only option?) <comment196397> I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but the `mv` command can go as deep into a directory as your system will allow. <comment196398> To avoid having to type out all the directory names you can use tab completion by typing the first few letters of a name and then pressing Tab. <comment196402> drag the file or folder into terminal and it will complete the path.  so "mv drag orig file drag dest folder" if that makes sense <comment196407> if it's a common thing you can symlink both deep directories and then mv ~/locA/foo.txt ~/locB
