Can you save an iMessage drawing? <body> I'm wondering if you can save a Digital Touch drawing made in iMessage on iOS10.  For example I made this drawing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/I3uqq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I took a screenshot of it but it's not the best option.  Once in the messages, if I press and hold the drawing I can "Copy" it, then  paste somewhere else (for example in a Note). But the resolution seems lower.  Is there a way to keep it as an image in the best possible resolution?  <answer253489> You can save it. After you send the drawing, underneath the word "keep" should appear. Click on it to save the drawing.
