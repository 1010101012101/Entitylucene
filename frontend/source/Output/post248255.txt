OS X experiencing failure at long sleep <body> At one point, my Macbook Pro (Late-2011 13 in. ver) started experiencing this issue every time it tries to wake up from a long sleep (longer than 1hr approximately). It fails to wake, and reboots instead, showing the pop-up that the os has shut down unexpectedly. It runs on a new SSD which replaced the old HDD.   I am trying to figure out if this is a hardware issue, or a configuration issue. One question that has arised on the way is about the hibernatemode value, which my OSX indicates 25. Is this a possible value?   When I ran codepmset -g/code it showed the following:  precodeActive Profiles: Battery Power       -1* AC Power        -1 Currently in use:  standbydelay         4200  standby              0  halfdim              1  sms                  1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  disksleep            10  sleep                10  hibernatemode        25  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         2  acwake               0  lidwake              1 /code/pre  <answer248257> Have you tried to reset the SMC and NVRAM?     strongTo reset the SMC:/strong      ol   liShut down the computer./li   liPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your computer./li   liOn the built-in keyboard, press the (left side) Shift-Control-Option keys and the power button at the same time./li   liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li   liPress the power button to turn on the computer./li   /ol   Source : Apple KB - Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac     strongTo reset the NVRAM (PRAM)/strong      ol   liShut down your Mac./li   liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (âŒ˜), Option, P, and R. /li   liTurn on your Mac./li   liPress and hold the Command-Option-P-R keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li   liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound for a second time./li   liRelease the keys./li   /ol   Source : Apple KB - How to Reset NVRAM on your Mac
