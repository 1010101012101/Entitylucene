CoreStorage Volume not detected <body> I had a Linux/OS X 10.11 dual boot configuration and wanted to remove the Linux partitions. I managed to remove them without any issue but when trying to merge the free space with the OS X partition something went wrong (I used the disk utility only), and after a reboot this is now shown when looking for the different partitions :  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2: FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF               170.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             649.1 MB   disk0s4 /dev/disk1 (disk image):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        +2.1 GB     disk1    1:                  Apple_HFS OS X Base System        2.0 GB     disk1s1  -bash-3.2# diskutil corestorage list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  I have found a similar issue but I am not familiar with OSX/BSD commands and wouldn't want to mess up something : Diskutil can&#39;t find Core Storage Volumes  And i get roughly the same results :  precode-bash-3.2# fsck_cs /dev/disk0s2    Executing fsck_cs (version 517.20.1) ** Checking volume ** Content Hint for disk0s2 is not Apple_CoreStorage ** disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers ** disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels ** Logical Volume Group 1AE35784-CFDF-445A-876D-23931CE9FB91 on 1 device ** disk0s2: Scan for Metadata Volume ** Logical Volume Group has a 24 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint ** Load and verify Segment Headers ** Load and verify Checkpoint Payload ** Load and verify Transaction Segment ** Incorporate 0 newer non-checkpoint transactions ** Load and verify Virtual Address Table ** Load and verify Segment Usage Table ** Load and verify Metadata Superblock ** Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees ** Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volume ** Load and verify 37BE577C-5FBD-4919-9864-C8501FD8E965 ** Load and verify 9DE1F86F-7BFC-420F-B751-55D20B107137 ** Load and verify Freespace Summary ** Load and verify Block Accounting ** Load and verify Live Virtual Addresses ** Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid ** Load and verify Segment Cleaning ** The volume 1AE35784-CFDF-445A-876D-23931CE9FB91 appears to be OK /code/pre  Could you please guide me through the steps described in the link above ?

I have found another stackexchange question which seems to be quite similar : How to fix broken GPT, GUID and unmountable, no type volumes?  But I am afraid of breaking things down even more if trying that alone, and I don't understand in which order I should follow the different steps (removing MBR/messed up partitions/GUID recovery). I would highly appreciate any help on that again, thanks in advance !  strongSolution/strong  Following the steps as described by klanomath I managed to recover that partition and save the files elsewhere. Note that I couldn't repair the disk after a verification through the disk utility, my guess is that the old version of the disk utility in the Internet recovery is not capable of doing that for something created with a recent version but I'm not sure about that.  Anyway, I got my data back, thanks a lot for your help klanomath !    hr  The free space is the linux system I removed.  <answer240526> Your GUID partition table and the MBR are bogus. Your second partition disk0s2 has the wrong partition type. Instead of FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF  the type should be 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC.  To modify the partition table destroy and create a new proper one. Afterwards you have to re-add the partitions in the old boundaries but with proper types.  strongPreparation:/strong  ul liRestart to Internet Recovery Mode by pressing kbdalt/kbd kbdcmd/kbd kbdR/kbd at startup.   The prerequisites are the latest firmware update installed, either ethernet or WLAN (WPA/WPA2) and a router with DHCP activated.br On a 50 Mbps-line it takes about 4 min (presenting a small animated globe) to boot into a recovery netboot image which usually is loaded from an Apple/Akamai server.  I recommend ethernet because it's more reliable. If you are restricted to WIFI and the boot process fails, just restart your Mac until you succeed booting.  Alternatively you may start from a bootable installer thumb drive (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan) or a thumb drive containing a full system (preferably Yosemite or El Capitan).
