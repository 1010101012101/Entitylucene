Choose Default Out CHANNEL for OS X Audio <body> I need to get my default audio output to outputs 3/4 of my audio interface. What is the easiest way to do this? Do I need Soundflower (and will it even work)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/biHdw.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer94224> Soundflower can do this easily (just tried it). Perhaps there is a way to do this with the built-in OS X stuff, though...  <answer94226> I'm not 100% sure if this will work, but have you tried the Audio MIDI Setup? Its located in codeApplications &gt; Utilities &gt; Audio MIDI Setup.app/code Your USB audio device should be listed in the left hand pane and from there you may be able to route the audio as you wish  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QMNS5.png" alt="Audio MIDI Setup window"  <answer108524> For me, I managed to switch the default stereo output from channels 1/2 to 3/4 by using Audio MIDI Setup and then from “Configure Speakers…” I'd tick the second, rather than first, stream.

None of the output sliders work, for one thing. Hmmmmm.... Soundflower adds too much latency.
