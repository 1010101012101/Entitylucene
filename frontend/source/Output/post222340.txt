How can I get the file from iOS "Classic>Alert" onto my computer? <body> I like this sound but I would like to use an audio editor to cut it in half.   Specifically what I am asking is what method I can use to extract this specific alert sound from my iOS device to a sound file on my Mac so I can edit it.  (iOS 9.2, Max OS X 10.11.2)  PS: The microphone on my Mac is broken, so simply recording the sound will not work  <answer222476> @Tetsujin:     It's already on the Mac, Alerts are in   code/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ToneLibrary.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Al‌​ertTones//code
