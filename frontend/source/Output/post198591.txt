How restore a USB Flash Drive without partition table? <body> I don't know why but my new USB Flash Drive seems not to have a partition table, and I'm unable to restore it with any standard tool. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jfx9E.png" alt="enter image description here" This is what I can see of it if I use the codediskutil list/code command. How can I fix it?  UPDATED trying to apply the partition in the Partition tab it will appear this message img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CA7wz.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment237663> Was/is there anything on the USB Flash Drive?  Have you tried using the Erase tab in Disk Utility? Please elaborate on: "_I'm unable to restore it with any standard tool._" <comment237664> I have tried the Erase on Disk Utility and the Formatting tools on windows, a list of shell tools but it seems always that I've not the necessary permission to erase de key. <comment237668> If you select the USB Flash Drive in the List pane of Disk Utility are you then able to select the Partition tab and then from the Partition Layout list box select "1 Partition" assuming it currently says "Current"? <comment237669> May be of interest: http://superuser.com/questions/689439/how-to-format-repair-a-write-protected-usb-drive-with-i-o-errors <comment237678> I have edited the question respondi to the last question
