How do I change which AirPod audio input comes from? <body> My AirPods are suddenly not working for audio input and I remember there was a way to force the OS to use the left or right one but I don't remember whether it was iOS or macOS. codeSound Preferences/code on the macOS doesn't seem to give me the option.  <answer286095> Sorry - just found it in iOS. You go to Bluetooth, select the (i) info icon to the right of the AirPods and then at the bottom is a codeMicrophone/code options: codeAutomatically Switch AirPods/code or codeAlways Left/Right AirPod/code.
