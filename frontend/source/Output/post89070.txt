How do I change the default font for comment boxes in Keynote <body> I am using Keynote '09 and whenever I create a comment, it is formatted in Marker Felt 16. I want to change that to something like Arial 20. How can I do it?  I tried to apply the point 5 in this answer, namely to create a comment in the master, format it and then select it and choose codeFormat/code  codeAdvanced/code  codeDefine Text for All Masters/code. However codeDefine Text for All Masters/code is greyed out for comments boxes.  Any other ideas?  <answer89137> This applies to Keynote 09 (5.3):  ol liCreate a comment on a master page, style as you wish./li liWith the comment selected, choose codeFormat/code  codeAdvanced/code  codeDefine Comment for all Masters/code/li liYou may now even delete the comment on your master page. New comments in the presentation will still be in the chosen format./li /ol  Hope this helps!  <comment104648> Thanks! In fact the trick was, once you've formatted the text, to click _somewhere on the border of the comment_ (outside the text area). There is no feedback that the comment is selected, but the text cursor mustn't blink. Then `Define Comment for all Masters` becomes available in `Format`  `Advanced`. If the text cursor is active, this menu isn't available. <comment104701> Thank **you**! I had never even considered you could change that horrible default font. <comment124618> I have tried the above procedure. No matter what I do, when I click on Advanced, everything is still gray. Could you please explain the procedure stepwise? I have Keynote 5.3.
