Xcode tools getting working without the Xcode CD or external drive? <body> I would like to get the Xcode-developer things to my Macs. I noticed that Apple has started to offer some terminal things online, more here. I am still lazy to get the CDs, to get all Xcode-developer things, is there some easy way to do it online without the Xcode CD? Is there any way to get all Xcode things pre-installed so not to waste time for their installation?  <answer65849> Xcode hasn't come on physical media for a long time now. These days, you can download it directly from the Mac App Store:  http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12  <comment78003> I'm confused - do you have a mac or [do you not have a Mac](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/65997/xcode-for-ipad)? <comment85022> @bmike it is not a question here. The question is historical because Apple did not earlier provide Xcode online, only on CD. It is solved. <comment85025> Thank you for cleaning this up. Simple, clear minimal questions really help the site be useful as a reference. <comment85028> @bmike agree with that!
