Photos i take on my iPhone are not appearing in the photostream on my PC <body> I have recently signed up to use iCloud after upgrading to a iPhone 4s.   My accounts were all verified and downloaded on my PC. I use Windows 7. Everything appears to be working - I have been able to access my contacts on iCloud.com etc and I have set up the settings to stream my photos. Whenever I take any they don't appear on my PC in the allocated photostream file. Also whenever I copy any to the upload file they don't appear on my iPhone either. I have Wi-fi connectivity on both the iPhone and my PC. I just don't understand. Help!
