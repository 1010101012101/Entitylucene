Cannot download any app <body> I tried to download an app using my Apple Id. But, when I clicked on download, it said network error and the link is disabled permanently. Do I have to have any prerequisite to do this?  <comment163103> Can you download other apps? <comment163104> Hey, no! I am wondering what's happening! <comment163105> You *do* have network connectivity? Did you try the usual (restart the phone, restart the WiFi router, try to download via 3G)? <comment163110> Please add a screenshot @user84481
