Moving iTunes music to Dropbox on iPhone5 <body> I have the upgraded Dropbox app but need to figure out how to move the music on my phone iTunes gallery over to Dropbox via my iPhone as I haven't been able to sync my music on my MacBook Air due to it being corrupt for a few months. Any suggestions? Cheers!  <comment187662> my instinctive guess would be, not possible. I don't think the sandboxing would allow it unless jailbroken
