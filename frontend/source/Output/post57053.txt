Connect Macbook Pro to TV wirelessly <body> I am currently using an HDMI adapter (and a cable for audio) to connect my Macbook Pro (2009) to my HD TV (no smart TV) and I use a wireless keyboard and mouse.    Is it possible to achieve the same result wirelessly? Note that I'm not looking for something like Apple TV. I want to see my desktop on the TV, possibly with audio as well.  <answer57088> Believe me you are looking for something like Apple TV and Apple computer made in or after 2011 with Mountain Lion installed. It's called Airplay Mirroring.  Or alternatively you can achive something similar with this app  <comment65593> is AirParrot compatible with 2009 MacBook Pros? <comment65853> Well, developer claims only OS requirement which is 10.6.8 +. So it must naturally be supported. But don't take my word for it, ask the developer if in doubt.
