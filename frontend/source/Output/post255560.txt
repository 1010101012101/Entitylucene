Use TestFlight without Developer Certificate <body> i have developed a XCode IOS app, but can i use it on my TestFlight without a Paid Dev Cert?  <comment318314> You will need a paid developer certificate anyway sooner or later, why do you want to use TestFlight without one? <comment318315> I dont want to get it in the AppStore, i just need it for private use <comment318316> If you just need it for yourself, you can get a certificate with the free dev account. Probably won't work with TestFlight, but you won't need it for private use anyway. <comment318317> So how to get a free one?and how do i add it to my iPhone? <comment318318> Start at https://developer.apple.com/programs/ <comment318319> Ok thank you.I hope itll work
