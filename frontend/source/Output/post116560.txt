Lost Mail when removed pop account to re-add as imap account <body> I removed an mail account from the mail application because it was configured as pop and had to be imap. Now I have lost my mail which was stored locally. I have read about iskysoft data recovery, but that tool has a folder structure which is huge. So I am clicking around in folders to see if there is any mail from 2011 etc.  I am not so familiar with Mac OS X and the mail application. These are times when you would want to have an up-to-date timecapsule backup, but that one is from november 2013 :S  Can you suggest a better mail recovery tool or a manual recovery? Or tell me that this is the right tool and that this will solve all my problems and will put back the lost e-mails in the Mail application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2tJo8.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have just read about disk drill. but that is no option for me (I think) because I should have used 'recovery vault' first. before removing the pop3 account. http://help.cleverfiles.com/mailbox-recovery-2/  <answer116569> You're going to have a hard time recovering the files and should power off the machine / only mount that drive in read-only mode until you have given up on the idea of data recovery.  I like Data Rescue 3 - but your tool will probably be mostly equivalent.  Look to recover code~/Library/Mail/code and code~/Library/Mail Downloads/code files if possible. Ideally you can get the computer friendly - human hostile directory structure back and recover all files with these extensions intact:  ul liemlx/li liplist/li /ul  <answer117308> According to an apple expert:     it cannot be recovered because it is an Apple Macbook air with an SSD drive which uses trim.   so the only option left was to restore mbox files from the 2 months old timecapsule backup. He took them from the ~/library/mail/v2 etc. folder.  Apple should change mail to allow it to remove the pop3 account and keep the mail and/or if it has to remove the mails, move it to the trash can so it can be restored.   another article about ssd and trim: http://help.cleverfiles.com/can-i-recover-data-if-trim-is-enabled-on-my-ssd-drive/  <comment136335> You said you are unfamiliar with it but are you familiar enough with Time Machine and have that set up? Additionally check your user folder's Library folder (Menu bar  Go  and while holding the alt/option key you should see Library). In the Library folder you should see a folder called Mail. How big is that folder and what is inside of it? <comment136337> V2 = 5.6 gb it has to imap folders, one mailboxes and one maildata. iskysoft shows a lot of folders with *.eimx files <comment136338> under Mailboxes is there a folder or mbox called Local or POP...? <comment136339> there is outbox.mbox, imported.mbox and deleted messages.mbox <comment136341> And no Time Machine set up? <comment136345> it is, but as I said, last backup was from november... the iskysoft shows mail from 2010 somewhere in the deleted folders... but unsure if that is the correct mail. <comment136353> is this the correct data rescue https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/10259/data-rescue <comment136365> Yes - I added a link to the vendor site above.
