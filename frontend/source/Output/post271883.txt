Why I have not the option to open the web Inspector interface - Safari? <body> I want to open this interface to look the source code or response, like below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Eyh7P.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But, when I want to open the codelocalhost:8080/xxx/code's page, I found I do not able to open that, it is gray:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vLpZr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So, how to resolve it in Safari?  <answer271896> There's another way of showing the Web Inspector.   Right/Secondary click on a web page and select: strongInspect Element/strong or strongReview the elements/strong.  <answer271971> The option is inactive because Safari doesn't understand the content type (MIME type) of the page or doesn't think it's HTML.  To open Web Inspector, use "Inspect Element" after right-clicking an element on the page, or open the Web Inspector on another page and then navigate to this page.  <comment341726> Pro tip: if you want to show screenshots with english version of the Safari, you can type this in Terminal: `/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/MacOS/Safari -AppleLanguages '(en)'`. <comment341727> @Mateusz Szlosk, thanks for your suggestion. <comment341728> @Mateusz Szlosek, now I have updated my post, so review it. <comment341729> Can You show us what is the "source" of the html file you want to inspect? I mean content of the file you want to open. <comment341731> @Mateusz Szlosek, it is a `Servlet` page, and maybe it has no html contents here. But I use firefox can open the `Web Inspector`. <comment341732> What is shown when you Secondary/Right click on a page and select **Inspect Element**? <comment341735> @Mateusz Szlosek, great, I right click the page, and select **Review the elements**, it shows the interface, thank you very much.
