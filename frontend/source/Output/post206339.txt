Install windows 10 on bootcamp fails <body> Im trying to install windows 10 with bootcamp. But what i`m trying it wil not work. I hope some one can help me. When i create a bootable USB via bootcamp this all works wel. than i delete the Bootcamp partition manually and create a new one (same size) and select the format option strongFree Space/strong  When i restart the MBP with the strongoption/strong button hold i see the EFI USB drive. When i start the installation process the, it is asking a few questions about the language and key, . also it is asking on which drive windows should be installed. I select the free space part and format it. Only then the strongnext/strong button lits-up. The install continues. When finalizing the installation im receiving an error strongWindows could not update the computer's boot configuration/strong  I have no clue why this is happening.  Does anyone have the same problem?

I tried a lot with an unsupported MBA 2011 and never saw such strange behaviour.  If you are able to skip the boot config error:  log in, DIRECTLY install boot camp software without reboot (like the unattended way from BCA). Once you can start the Bootcamp tool, you are able to select the boot partition an this apple tool seems to be able to edit the BCD in the UEFI Firmware correctly.  <answer206923> Go to codeApplications/code - codeUtilities/code click codeBoot Camp Assistant/code follow the step by step instructions   ul liFormat the partitioned drive first/li liGive the partition at least 40GBs/li liMake sure you have a valid copy of windows /li /ul  If you need more help here are a couple of videos with step by step instructions:  ul liHow to Install windows 10/li liMake a Bootable USB_Drive/li /ul  <answer269079> So back in the day (2014) I had an issue that sounds similar installing Windows 7. The underlying cause was my USB 3 thumb drive that I was using as the Windows install disk. I wrote about it here: https://deciphertools.com/blog/2014_08_09_bootcamp_unable_to_create_new_system_partition/ (the "Setup was Unable to Create a New System Partition" for Windows 7 sounds vaguely in the realm of your "Windows could not update the computer's boot configuration")  Curious if using a USB dvd drive or USB 2.0 thumb drive still fixes this problem. According to this page from Apple (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204990) it looks promising.
