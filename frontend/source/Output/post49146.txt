Can I hide the toolbar in Safari while in Full Screen mode? <body> When in non-full-screen mode, Safari lets me use the kbd⌘/kbd+kbd|/kbd shortcut or strongView  Hide Toolbar/strong to hide the URL and search bar, etc. However, when I'm in Full Screen mode, this option is greyed out. Is there any way I can hide it without exiting Full Screen?  <answer49147> Enter full screen mode, right-click anywhere around the address bar then click "Hide Toolbar" in the menu that appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0spB.png" alt="enter image description here"  Although next time you enter full screen mode the toolbar comes back.  <answer119581> Open console (⌥⌘C or strongDevelop  Show Error Console/strong), paste this code:  precode(function() {   var el = document.createElement('div'),       docEl = document.documentElement;    el.innerText = 'Go to fullscreen view';   el.setAttribute('style', 'position: fixed; top: 10%; left: 10%; padding: 30%; background: #000; color: #fff; opacity: .7; cursor: pointer;')   document.body.appendChild(el)    el.onclick = function() {     if (docEl.requestFullscreen) {       docEl.requestFullscreen();     } else if (docEl.mozRequestFullScreen) {       docEl.mozRequestFullScreen();     } else if (docEl.webkitRequestFullscreen) {       docEl.webkitRequestFullscreen();     }     document.body.removeChild(el);   }; })(); /code/pre  and click the black box.  You need to activate Developer-Tools for this solution. To enable Developer-Tools, go to Advanced, click "Show Develop menu in menu bar" at the bottom of the window.  <answer260164> In Safari 10.0.1 on macOS Sierra it is quite simple - you have to uncheck strongView/strong  strongAlways Show Toolbar in Full Screen/strong to hide the toolbar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ynBCh.png" alt="**View** &gt; **Always Show Toolbar in Full Screen**"  <comment56262> Be careful, because once you do this, the only way to get the bar back is to exit and then enter full screen mode again. <comment103173> no, you can click view/customize toolbar... to restore it <comment133771> This doesn't seem to work in Mavericks. <comment139470> Checkout my solution below. It'll work with Mavericks. <comment167820> i wonder if this could be made into a bookmarklet <comment234931> `javascript:document.documentElement.webkitRequestFullScreen()` <comment234934> @ralfix, your solution won't work since Webkit-based browser require function like this triggered by user action (via click event for example). <comment242003> @rgtos: It actually works fine for me, using Safari 8.0.8.
