Info.plist is always readonly <body> I want to edit Finder Info.plist file that is located here:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  But when I try to edit the file by codevi/code the file is readonly.  precode# vi /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  When I try to codechmod/code or codechown/code the file nothing happens.  When I try to change file permission from Finder I get the error: "The operation can’t be completed because you don’t have the necessary permission."  The Locked checkbox in Get Info is disabled.  I also tried:  precodesudo chflags nouchg Info.plist /code/pre  But after all that, file is still readonly.   What is preventing coderoot/code from editing this file on OS X El Capitan 10.11.2?  <answer221441> That file is explicitly protected by SIP.  precodels -lO /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Info.plist /code/pre  The "restricted" flag listed by the O (capital letter o) option to the codels/code command shows SIP status of the file.  To change that one file, you would need to disable System Integrity Protection. SIP is a security measure to prevent any User up to and including root (and thereby most malware) from modifying system files.   To disable:  ul liBoot into Recovery Mode (Hold Command+R while turning on Mac)./li liOpen Terminal (Click Utilities  Terminal). /li liType: codecsrutil disable/code/li liRestart your computer, and SIP will be disabled./li /ul  You should now be able to modify Finder's info.plist file.  <answer269978> What shall I do after restoring the SIP?  Sorry, many of us online users are complete novices when using the Terminal.app. Trying to read up on it is overwhelming just to overcome a small problem.  <comment268125> thanks it worked but i booted into recovery by holding Command+R <comment268128> @Seifolahi, Yes, per [OS X: About OS X Recovery](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) it's "command ⌘ + R", and the answer has been edited to reflect that.
