Apple TV 2nd generation instructions to hook up to a 55" Visio Smart TV <body> How can I hook up a 2nd generation AppleTV box to a Visio xvt473sv 55" Smart TV using only the optical cord, as none of the HDMI outlets work on the TV?  I've tried to hook it up to the Visio 55" Smart TV using an optical cord, because the TV's HDMI ports don't seem to work.  Is it possible to use the optical cable to connect the Apple TV?  <comment364144> Optical cords are meant to carry audio signals only. You will only get audio in a preserved container. No video.
