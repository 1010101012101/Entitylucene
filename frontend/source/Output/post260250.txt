Can't connect to Cisco AnyConnect with IPsec on macOS <body> I'm not having any luck connecting to a Cisco AnyConnect Gateway that is using IPsec using eap-md5 on my Mac running macOS Sierra. I have unsuccessfully attempted to connect with the native VPN client and anyconnect. I know for certain that the gateway is accessible because I'm able to successfully connect on my iOS device using the URL:  precode [ipsec://][&lt;AUTHENTICATION&gt;[“:”&lt;IKE-IDENTITY&gt;“@”]] &lt;HOST&gt;[“:”&lt;PORT&gt;][“/”&lt;GROUP-URL&gt;] /code/pre  Please note that the port and group-url are not know, so it's left blank.  However, the above URL is not needed because the macOS native client has a setting for Cisco IPSec.  The error I see we attempting to connect via command line &amp; Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client (version 4.3.03086) is:  precode warning: Unable to contact xxxxx.xxxx.xxx.net. error: Connection attempt has timed out. Please verify Internet connectivity. /code/pre  Is there anything I'm missing here?
