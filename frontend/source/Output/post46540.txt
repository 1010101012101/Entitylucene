MacBook frozen immediately after logging in <body> I've had an ongoing issue (since Snow Leopard and now on Lion) with my MacBook Air. After a restart or when I boot the machine up, I type in my password to login, and then about 25% of the time it freezes.  I can still move the mouse, but if I try clicking something, the beach ball loding icon spins forever. I can move the mouse over to where my hidden dock is to reveal it, but if I try clicking anything, the same thing happens as above. The status bar shows up, but only loads up some of the applications I have to set to launch at startup.  When I try killing a process with kbdCommand/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdEsc/kbd, nothing happens. The only thing that does work is holding down the power button until the system restarts.  I'm still using Legacy FileVault, if that makes any difference.  Any ideas how to fix this problem?  <comment53210> Tried it booting from another source? Could rule out software problem. I would suggest swapping RAM but it's an Air. <comment53224> Anything interesting in the system log files? <comment53268> Tried booting into safe mode? Hold shift when starting up.
