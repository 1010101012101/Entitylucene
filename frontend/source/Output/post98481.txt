Black Macbook running 10.5.8 reporting Connection Timeout to Wifi network <body> We recently bought my grandfather a refurbished Macbook. It is running the most up-to-date version of leopard -- Mac OS X 10.5.8. His computer does not connect to his wifi network, which is run via a comcast router. The macbook recently was able to connect to his network, but now a "connection timeout" is preventing him from getting wireless internet.  Two things are strange about his wifi issue. One, my iphone, ipad, and computer are able to connect to his wifi network. The only device that cannot connect is his device.  Second, his macbook connects to wifi at other locations, including my office and at my home. The only place the device cannot get wireless internet is at his home.  Here are a few details that are probably important. My iphone, ipad, and computer, which all connect to the wifi network in his home, are running software much more recent than Mac OSX 10.5.8. Also, the wireless networks at my office and my home operate via Mac airports. My grandfather does not have an airport at his home.  Does anyone know why a Macbook running 10.5.8 might be able to connect to wifi networks connected via Mac Airports but not via a comcast router that other apple products can connect to?  Thanks for your help.  -- David  <comment115626> Hi David, thanks for lots of background info :) what is missing is info on the wifi, like does his mac shows the Comcast wifi. <comment115630> Have you tried power cycling the comcast router? <comment115631> Set up the Comcast as top network. <comment115645> What type of wireless security is in place on the home router? WPA, WPA2, WEP? Also check out Apple Menu  System Preferences  Network. Then click on the Wifi/Airport connection. What do you see there?
