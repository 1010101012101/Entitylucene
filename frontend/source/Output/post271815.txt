MacBook Pro 2016 going to sleep after one minute no matter what my settings are <body> My energy saver preferences are as follows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nN8L8.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, no matter what I set the slider to, my MacBook Pro is going to sleep after one minute. What is wrong here?  <answer271837> My first instinct would be to reset the SMC.  strongResetting the SMC/strong  To do this on your particular MBP, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your computer /li liKeep the power cable strongplugged in/strong. /li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd  (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd /li liLet go /li liTurn your computer back on with the power button. /li /ol  Also, you should probably reset the NVRAM as well.  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong   For all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these  steps:   ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out. /li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the  kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong /li listrongKeep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!/strong /li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system  preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone  information, etc).

I have them both set on the third ticker. <comment341659> Open the terminal, type `pmset -g`, and paste the output here <comment341662> System-wide power settings: Currently in use:  standbydelay         10800  standby              1  womp                 1  halfdim              1  hibernatefile        /var/vm/sleepimage  powernap             1  gpuswitch            2  networkoversleep     0  disksleep            10  sleep                0 (sleep prevented by iTunes)  autopoweroffdelay    28800  hibernatemode        3  autopoweroff         1  ttyskeepawake        1  displaysleep         15  acwake               0  lidwake              1 <comment341695> Also ensure you do not have a magnet near the left or right side of the Mac. The Mac uses magnets in the display to put it to sleep when the display is closed.

If that doesn't help, when you say it's going to sleep after 1 minute, is it going to a full sleep or is it just preparing to sleep? That is, after one minute is it just dimming the screen and then going to full sleep after three minutes? Or is it doing something else? And, what happens if you change it to five minutes? Finally, what happens when you boot into Safe Mode (you can do this by holding down the Shift key during startup). <comment341968> Ah, silly me! The screensaver was coming on after one minute.
