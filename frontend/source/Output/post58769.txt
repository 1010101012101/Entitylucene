My keyboard stopped repeating - how to fix? <body> I have both an internal and external keyboard but the key-repeat has stopped working.  I've tried changing both 'Key Repeat' and 'Delay Until Repeat' as shown below but no setting seems to be helping.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l4oGl.png" alt="enter image description here"  This is a brand new mac (5 weeks old).  <answer58847> Well it looks like there are a couple solutions:  strongOption 1./strong Enter this in terminal: codedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false/code. To disable repeating keys again, enter the same command except change the codefalse/code to codetrue/code.  strongOption 2./strong Download Mountain Tweaks (I assume you're on Mountain Lion, if not, download Lion Tweaks) and click the "Yes" option for "Enable Repeating Keys":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zmXWT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer85352> If running  precodedefaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false /code/pre  seems to have no effect, try a restart. This seems to be necessary in more recent versions of OS X.  <comment67689> What OS are your using? Did you recently upgrade to Lion/Mountain Lion? What computer model are you using? <comment67701> updated with the fact it is new <comment67705> And repeat used to work, but now it doesn't? <comment67758> Try this command: `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false` <comment131922> I have the same problem, and my Mac is new from 3 days ! I have Mavericks. Key repeating was working, but not fast enough to my taste. So I went to the Keyboard System Prefs, and now key repeating has stopped working. <comment278764> @NicolasBarbulesco  Did you get the key repeating issue resolved? Actually I am on El Capitan now. <comment280806> I can confirm that key repeat is not working on this 13" MBP, 1 week old, El Capitan, 10.11.3. <comment302802> Don't forget to *reload applications* you use so as to allow this feature to take effect. They don't catch this option "on fly" quite often <comment334556> application restart is definitely necessary
