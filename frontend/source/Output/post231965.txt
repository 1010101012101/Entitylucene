Problem with scripted account deletion syntax <body> I'm working on an account cleanup script module that can handle the hidden and unhidden accounts we're creating in bulk on new MacOS systems.  We've kept the logic simple to start.  However I keep getting an error: line 4: [: missing `]'  I have the space...what am I missing? I tried syntax checks and it passes muster.  precode#!/bin/bash USERNAME=administrator  if [ dscl . -list /Users | grep -v '^_' | grep $USERNAME ];     then     echo "Deleting user account $USERNAME"     dscl . -delete "/Users/$USERNAME" else     echo "The admin account $USERNAME does not exist here" fi  if [ -d "/$USERPATH/$USERNAME" ];     then     echo "Deleting leftover user account folder $USERPATH/$USERNAME"     rm -rf $USERPATH/$USERNAME fi  if [ -d "/Users/$USERNAME" ];     then     echo "Deleting leftover user account folder /Users/$USERNAME"     rm -rf /Users/$USERNAME] fi /code/pre  <answer231968> code[/code (and code[[/code) expect an expression, not a command; so you can't directly run commands inside a test.  When you put a pipe in your condition it terminates the evaluation started with code[/code which makes code]/code to be treated as an argument to the last codegrep/code.  Try putting your condition inside code$()/code like so:  precodeif [ $(dscl . -list /Users | grep -v '^_' | grep $USERNAME) ]; /code/pre  That way the expression (including all the pipes) is going to be executed first and return its exit code to be used in your evaluation.  <answer231985> In your piped statement only the exit status of the last grep is used and you do not need the test brackets. You can also eliminate the first grep.   precodeif dscl . -list  /Users | grep -w "$username" then     .........     ......... else     ......... fi /code/pre  Please test before using.  <comment283551> Thank you for the comment - I did that as a first gate control due to the system accounts...accounts that we don't want to delete. IE if one of our techs uses a system account name by accident I don't want that account getting deleted even by accident/  The code is intended to be reused so I wanted it to be idiot proof in case someone creates a "www" account which would be OK to delete, as opposed to _WWW which cannot be touched. <comment283552> Thank you! That did it. I really appreciate the help.
