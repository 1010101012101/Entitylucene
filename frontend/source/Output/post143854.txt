Adding words to Hiragana input's dictionary <body> I am trying to figure out how to add new words to the Japanese dictionary.   Specifically, my problem is, name of one of my friends is Manaka, spelled  愛可 (yes, that's 可愛い in reverse).  Problem is, if I type in まなか and try find an appropriate kanji substitute, the only one that I find is 愛花 (and yes, I've tried looking at the general kanji selection, by the reading, by radical,  names, etc).  Currently I type her name in by typing in あいか, which is annoying.  Is there a way to teach the hiragana input, that when I type in まなか I want to see 愛可 as one of the options presented to me?  MacOS X 10.7, MBP 13", English UI with Hiragana input added.  <answer143858> I do not know how to do that with the Hiragana Dictionary but how about this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pDI6P.jpg" alt="text replace"  So now each time you type Manaka it will be replaced with  愛可.  <answer143884> Try using the Kotoeri Word Register  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zS1av.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment169476> Doesn't the Kotoeri Word Register do this?  I think you find it toward the bottom of the "flag" menu when Hiragana is active. <comment169510> It is a very clever hack, and you are right, normally it would work. Unfortunately this is not really a viable solution in this case, since Japanese has a many words that are pronounced the same way, yet mean a completely different things. In this case, the other kanji for まなか, the one that is actually pretty often used is 真中, middle, centre, midway. And using a code word to substitute in 愛可 is not really any different from typing in あいか、that I do now. Thank you for attempting to help, however.
