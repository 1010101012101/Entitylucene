USB Directories not visible with Mac <body> I recently had some virus on my USB. After cleaning (with PC antivirus), i got all my files back, but the directories on my USB are not shown when connected to my Mac (Lion) computer.br What can I do to access them with my Mac?br Thank you.  <answer92447> I think the MacOS does not show folders if they have the "x" flag missing.  Try going to a Terminal window, then changedir to the folder   precodecd /Volumes  ls  cd name-of-folder-with-stick /code/pre  And there try   precodels  chmod 755 foldername /code/pre  or even (for all files and folders there)  precodechmod 755 *  /code/pre  <comment108261> Do you still see them in the terminal ? (Your USB drive is mounted in `/Volumes/`)
