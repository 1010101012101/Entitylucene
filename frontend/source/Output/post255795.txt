Can't change photos in Preview.app â€“ permission problems only in ~/Desktop <body> After upgrading to Sierra I can't change any document with Preview if it is saved under ~/Desktop. I get the error "emThe original document can't be chnaged, so a duplicate with your changes has been created./em" However, if I copy the same file to my Documents or Dropbox folder I can edit it. The folder permissions for ~/Desktop my Documents folder are the same:  precodedrwx------+  54 myname  staff   1836 Oct  4 10:41 Desktop drwx------+  26 myname  staff    884 Oct  4 10:40 Documents /code/pre  Permissions for the file is   precode-rw-r--r--@   1 myname  staff      247097 Aug  9 09:45 picture.jpg /code/pre  Even if I change the picture and Desktop folder to 777 I can't edit it.
