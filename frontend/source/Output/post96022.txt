Mail.app : What do the padlock icons mean? <body> If I encrypt an email with S/MIME an icon showing a CLOSED padlock is displayed under "Security". However, if I encrypt using OpenPGP it's an OPEN padlock icon. Both are followed by the word "Encrypted" though.  Why the two icons / What's the difference?  <comment112719> Open is not encrypted. <comment112722> @Buscar웃 That's not true. In the case of OpenPGP an **open** padlock means that an email has been decrypted and it's readable. Why the difference with S/MIME I don't know. <comment112752> @Thecafremo Standard Icon is closed padlock (if using Signature with Certificate) so my guess is Open means something else. <comment112767> @Buscar웃 I tested it this morning, and it works as I said. If you receive an email, encrypted with *OpenPGP* and you read it (you enter the correct passphrase an it *stores* it), the padlock displayed is *open* and the word *Encrypted* is by it side.
