German iTunes Store: No Bank / Paypal? <body> I'm a long time customer of the German iTunes store (recently only iTunes match). My VISA was not valid anymore, so I had to change. Not having a VISA atm, I wanted to go for Paypal or direct bank transactions.... however, I could see neither of them on my screen..  This despite internet research showing both apparently are supported for the German store - how can I salvage this?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HExEv.png" alt="Screenshot"  <answer229340> The itunes stores payment option for your country is the one you see there when editing your payment option.  You also can select none for the moment and get an iTunes Gift Card  <comment165918> Please don't bump your question by adding superfluous content. <comment171048> How else would I bump them? <comment171188> You shouldn't bump your questions at all. If you wish to attract attention to your question, you can start a bounty. Also, note that Community will bump (poke) unanswered questions automatically anyway.
