Blur text in iMovie 10.0.7 <body> I want to blur sensitive information in my video. How do I do that in iMovie 10.0.7?   "Adjust", "Video Overlay settings" options are missing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7CFGD.jpg" alt="If I select an image I don&#39;t get adjust &amp; video overlay settings option"  <answer182756> I found an apple discussion that seemingly answers your question:  strongQuestion/strong     I went to the help menu and it instructs me to click an icon that doesn't appear.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   strongAnswer/strong     Yes I had this problem as well, I found out that you have to Drag the clip from EVENTS into your PROJECT.      But when you do so, make sure that you drag it just over the top, not actually into the clip. The icon should then appear.   I am sure that codeVideo Overlay settings/code have the same reason to not show up as the codeAdjust/code option  Hope this helps
