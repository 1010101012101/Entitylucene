Skype pinned tab "breaks out" into a normal tab in Safari <body> I'm trying to pin the Skype web client into a pinned tab in Safari.   It works okay at first[1] but after a while the app decides I have been logged out and wants me to log back in. It pops open a new tab (somewhere on codelive.com/code I think) with the Microsoft login page.  However after logging in, the Skype web app is now in that new tab. Reloading the pinned tab only open a new tab with the Skype client (after redirecting through live.com again).  I can restore the original functionality by throwing away the pinned tab and pinning the new tab instead. But that's dumb.  Is there a way (browser setting, Safari extension etc) to force Skype[2] to stay in the pinned tab?  [1] Except it stops receiving new messages after a while and needs to be reloaded, but that's presumably a programming error in Skype for web. Hope it'll be fixed.  [2] Microsoft's Office 365 has the same problem, preventing the effective pinning of the Outlook web client.
