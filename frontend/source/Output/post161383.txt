Can I forcibly deactivate an iPad? If not, what are my options? <body> I've just been given a corporate iPad mini that previously was used by someone else in my team. It emappears to have/em been factory reset - it is taking me through the welcome and setup process (language selection/wi-fi selection/etc.), but once I've connected it to the network, it says the iPad is currently linked to an strongexisting/strong Apple ID (it masks it with stars, but shows enough information that I can see who that is) and asks me to sign in with that Apple ID (which I don't have). The person in question is uncontactable. Is there any way I can forcibly reset it and remove its link to that Apple ID? If not, are there any options which make it more useful than a lightweight doorstop?  <answer161384> In short, no. It's a security feature to prevent thieves from selling the device on, as it is rendered useless if you don't have the person in question's apple ID and password.  <answer161386> Quickest way to discover if it's possible to reset is to try itâ€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0cpm.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you can't get that far, it's a brick.  <comment188549> If it still wants a previous ID, it hasn't been reset. <comment188552> Fair point, thanks. I edited my question :) <comment188553> Only if it's been put in Lost Mode, otherwise you can simply reset it. <comment188554> @Tetsuijin, how would I reset it? I am seeing the welcome/setup process screen, there appears to be no option to do that. If I don't connect it to Wifi or iTunes, it refuses to proceed; when I do, it asks for the Apple ID. <comment188557> You can't 'simply' reset it. It defeats the whole point of asking for a password. They wouldn't ask for one if not. <comment188558> @AndrewFerrier "it asks for the Apple ID" - do you mean it is telling you an appleid and askign for the password, or does it just want an appleid?  If its the second, go to appleid.apple.com and make a new one. <comment188559> Couldn't find a pic of an iPad, but it's very similar <comment188560> @Tyson, an existing one. I clarified the question. <comment188561> @StanHutcheon, understood, I was trying to understand what Tetsujin was referring to. <comment188562> I can't get that far. I'm in the welcome/setup process screens. <comment188563> This doesn't bypass activation lock. See the linked question and answer... <comment188564> It wasn't clear initially at what point it was requesting the ID - if it was at the App Store etc, then it hadn't been reset but was still a possibility. If you can't get in at all, it's now a brick. <comment188565> then it's a brick. Apple themselves can clear it, if you can prove ownership; there's no other way. Give it back to IT & let them deal with it.
