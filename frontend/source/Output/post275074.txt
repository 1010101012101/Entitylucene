How display file path at bottom in "All My Files" on Sierra 10.12.3? <body> On older versions of macOS there used to be a file path at the bottom of "All My Files" so you could see where the files were located &amp; click to path if wanted.  Here's a random example I found online:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q7ezZ.png" alt="All My Files in Finder"  (file path can be seen at very bottom)  How can I enable this on Sierra (10.12.3)?  <answer275079> The one you reference in the screenshot can be enabled in either of the following two ways:  strongUsing the Mouse/strong  ol liEnsure the Finder is active/li liGo to the View menu/li liSelect the Show Path Bar option/li /ol  strongUsing the keyboard/strong  You can also use the following keyboard shortcut:  kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdP/kbd  You may not be aware, but you can also customise the Finder Toolbar to include a Path button. To do this:  ol liEnsure the Finder is active/li liGo to the View menu/li liSelect the Customise Toolbar... option/li liDrag the Path icon to your toolbar/li liClick on Done/li /ol  strongNote:/strong The icon looks like: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xljTI.png" alt="The path icon looks like:"  <answer275194> You can display the file path at any time without changing any preferences. Just  command-click the proxy icon in the title bar of the window.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctug5.jpg" alt="file path displayed from title bar"  The file path appears just like it would when using the file path icon. The great thing is that this doesn't just work in the Finder -- it will work in most applications in which you have a file open in a window.   <comment345977> One thing about turning on the path bar is that it's then on **everywhere** --- in the past it seemed to only be on (for me) in "all my files", unless I'm mistaken. Is there a way to re-create this? (or maybe it was just in search(?)) <comment345984> Pretty sure that's how it's always been, at least for a while now. It's also the reason I don't use it and opt instead for the path button in the Finder toolbar - I just click on that to view the path when I need to. For me that's a better option, although it took me a little while to get used to.
