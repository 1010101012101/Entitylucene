Checking iTunes collection for DRM <body> How can I check which songs or videos that I purchased from the iTunes Store have DRM restrictions?  All of the mobile OSes are very impressive to me at the moment, and I'm thinking about trying a non-iOS device again. I want to know now the impact it has on my Apple-sourced music collection though.  Is there a date cut-off for purchases when items went DRM free?  <answer149170> strongDelete Old DRM Copies of iTunes Music and Download DRM-Free Versions/strong  If you purchased any music from iTunes between 2003 and 2009, you downloaded tracks with DRM (Digital Rights Management) in them. Apple's long since removed the DRM, but you might not have. Wired shows how to update your music library with the new, DRM-free versions.   The process here is pretty simple, but if you're anything like me, you never bothered to actually do it:  ul liBefore starting, make sure you are signed in to the iTunes Store [Store menu] &amp; can see the columns for strongKind/strong &amp; strongiCloud Download/strong in your strongSongs/strong view in iTunes, then sort by strongKind/strongbr Scroll down to find 'Protected AAC audio file' as a Kind - those are the ones you need to replace./li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m7KIc.png" alt="iTunes"  ol liIn iTunes, select iTunes  Preferences and click the "Store tab"/li liMake sure "Show iTunes in the Cloud Purchases" is checked and close the Preferences panel/li liClick on the cloud icon in your list view and make sure all your purchases are there (note which songs are here and do not delete anything in step 5 that isn't available for download)/li liNow, delete the old DRM versions by sorting by "Kind" in the list view (if it's not there, go to View  Show View Options and select it) /li liScroll down to see if any tracks are listed as "Protected AAC audio file." That's the DRM music you need to replace. If you can download it again from iTunes with the cloud icon, you can delete the DRMed version/li /ol  Once you run through the process of deleting those songs you can download them from the cloud at any point, DRM free. This has been around for a while, but if you haven't grabbed those DRM free versions, now's as good a time as any.
