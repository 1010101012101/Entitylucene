Repeat a song in afplay <body> I am using codeafplay/code to play a song and I want it to be repeat. Is it possible just using codeafplay/code?  <answer126679> Loop it in cycle:  In terminal:  precodewhile :; do afplay /path/to/song.mp3; done /code/pre  <answer215613> Expanding what @user3439968 said, if you use the fish shell, you can loop like this:  precodewhile true; afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff; end /code/pre
