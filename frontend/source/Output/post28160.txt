How do I get my iTunes "Album Artwork" to add to the individual files instead of "~/Music/iTunes/Album Artwork/" <body> iTunes saves Album Artwork to ~/Music/iTunes/Album/Artwork/Cache/[some seemingly random folder name here]/  The problem is that if I move actual MP3 and AAC files from this computer (and/or iTunes database) to another one, I (assume that I) will lose the connection between those songs and the cached artwork.  Right now there is 826 MB worth of of cached images in 950+ files.  I am almost certain that it is possible to add album art directly to the media files, but I need a solution which can be automated (at least most of it) because I really don't want to do this 950+ times, and I have a lot more music to clean up in the future.

If that doesn't do it for you, you may find something else useful on that site.   Note: I haven't run this script myself and can't vouch for its efficacy, though I believe its source is well-regarded. Use at your own risk.  <comment32348> Now that you mention it, I think I may have used that in the past. [And yes, DougScripts are excellent.] I actually thought it was a built-in feature of iTunes until I couldn't find it. But I still wonder if there are any other methods available.
