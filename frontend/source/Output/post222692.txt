How to prevent my Retina MacBook Pro from accessing Internet when sleeping? <body> When I close my Retina Macbook Pro's lid and put it to sleep, I have noticed that it periodically must "wake" and check the internet or connect to Wi-Fi when I expect it to be sleeping.  This has been consistent for me even with my previous MacBook Pro, too.  I see this because my Gmail tab in Chrome will have new emails preloaded, before the Wi-Fi connection is reenabled.  Or when I have an IRC client open, I'll see multiple join/disconnects in the log.  codepmset -g sched/code does not print anything.  How can I stop it from doing this?  <comment269868> Try disabling Power Nap https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204032 <comment269869> Before enable the sleep mode turn off Wi-Fi connection. <comment269870> @Mattia This is, at best, a workaround. It's certainly no fix. <comment269871> @enderland Could you add the output of `pmset -g sched`? <comment269872> @MaxRied done. Arc that seems promising... <comment269873> @enderland This means that there is no time scheduled wake up, so it certainly is an interesting information. <comment269874> @enderland Does `pmset -g log | grep DarkWake` output anything, and if, do the times and dates correspond to the wakeups you experience? <comment269876> @Arc676, You should create an answer with info from that link. I'd +1 it you did. <comment269877> @user3439894 Unfortunately, the link doesn't say anything about applications also doing things while the Mac is in sleep mode (only mentions Mail and iCloud). I can't be certain that this is actually the root cause, and I can't test it because my Mac doesn't support Power Nap. At best I can wait for OP to test and post results.
