What must I enter into Terminal, using sudo to make myself an administrator? <body> My user account is a standard account on my Mac. What must I enter into Terminal using codesudo/code, to make myself the administrator?  <answer219713> That's a bit of a Catch22â€¦  You need to already strongbe/strong an administrator to be on the sudoers list [with very few manually-changed exceptions]  Essentially, you cannot promote yourself.br That's the entire point of sudo &amp; being an administrator, to be able to assign non-admins limited abilities.  <answer219723> If the actual user em&lt; user_name /em has a standard account, you would have to enter  precodesudo dscl . -append /Groups/admin GroupMembership &lt;user_name&gt; /code/pre  to make em&lt; user_name /em an admin.  Only a restricted number of users are emsudoers/em (i.e. accounts which are allowed to run codesu/code or codesudo/code with root privileges successfully) though. The standard sudoers file (em/etc/sudoers/em) in OS X looks like this:  precode... # User privilege specification root    ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL  # Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands # %wheel    ALL=(ALL) ALL ... /code/pre  So only emroot/em and members of the admin group are allowed to run codesudo/code by default. The above command run by em&lt; user_name /em will fail consequently, because  em&lt; user_name /em isn't in the list.  To enable emsudoing/em for em&lt; user_name /em, you would have to add em&lt; user_name /em to the list (below em# User privilege specification/em) or uncomment the %wheel line with codesudo visudo/code which has to be run by emsudoers/em again (that's the Catch22 mentioned by Tetsujin).  <answer219879> If you have access to an administrator account, you can become that account temporarily with:  precodesu - &lt;admin_username&gt; /code/pre  From there you can perform administrative actions via codesudo/code.  If you do not have access to an administrator account, then there is no "sanctioned" way of getting admin access (since that's the whole point to having separate admin roles), but there are plenty of less-than-legitimate ways of attaining it, such as privilege escalation exploits or booting into single-user mode. (These will be left as an exercise to the reader.)  <comment265740> Nicely specific to counter my 'wonderfully vague'. +1, as always. <comment265788> I don't recall: didn't the latest OSX rev. include some sort of "not-really-sudo" that lacks full standard Unix su rights? <comment265856> Is this about permanently changing your user account, or about running a terminal session with the rights of an admin (or root) user for which you know the logon info? <comment265867> @CarlWitthoft Yep, you're probably thinking about [SIP](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899).
