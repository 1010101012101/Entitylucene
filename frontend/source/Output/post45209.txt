How can I remove the bluetooth setup wizard on a headless Mac Mini? <body> I finally moved my old Mini into the back room on a TV.  I use Air Mouse to control it from my iOS devices.  However, with no keyboard and mouse connected it seems to bring up the bluetooth setup wizard each time I wake it from sleep.  This is a 2007 (core duo 1.83) running the latest Snow Leopard.  How do I disable this behavior or utility?  <answer45218> You can disable the Bluetooth Setup Wizard by:  ul liGo to System Preferences/li liClick Bluetooth/li liClick Advanced/li liUn-check 'Open Bluetooth Setup Assistant at start up when no input device is present'./li /ul  The screen should look like this (the checkbox above the highlighted section): img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pMmfn.png" alt="advanced bluetooth"   More information in this Apple KB - Wireless Input Devices  Also, if you are not using Bluetooth at all, you can disable it as well.  <comment51475> Have you tried disabling Bluetooth? <comment51549> @KyleCronin You know, I hadn't even thought of that.
