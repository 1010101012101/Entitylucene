Highlighting text and then tapping delete only deletes 1 character <body> If I highlight text (drag and select with mouse) then hit delete, it sometimes only deletes 1 character, from the selection. Has anyone had similar problems?  <comment306161> It would help us if you provided some more info, such as what you're using, OS, specific apps, etc.  You can see [ask] on how to ask questions that have a good chance at getting answers. <comment306162> El Capitan and Facebook.com in Chrome <comment306185> Is this only happening in Facebook in Chrome? Or across your entire system? <comment306199> I'm going to have to watch closer. I can't replicate it in Skype, right now, at least. <comment306206> @User so the problem is still happening in Chrome? Or is it just on Facebook? It would be helpful if you added more context/information to your question.
