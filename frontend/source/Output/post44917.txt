Animate a pie-chart in Keynote <body> Suppose I want to compare two situations via two pie-charts. I know I can grow a pie-chart per part in an animation or on click. But I would like to be able to transition that pie-chart to new numbers and it grows or shrinks the appropriate parts automagically.  Clarification: I would like to animate between these two pie-charts: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQFAe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44964> Here's one approach that's fairly quick and easy:  Create a Pie chart and input its values with the emChart Data Editor/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MHBTy.png" alt="image of Chart Data Editor"  With the chart object selected, open the emSlide Inspector/em and set the transition for emMagic Move/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EHwHI.png" alt="image of Slide Inspector"   With the chart still selected, copy the chart object using the menu or kbdâŒ˜/kbd + kbdc/kbd  Create a new slide following your original and paste the chart object onto it.  Use the emChart Data Editor/em to change the values for your empie slices/em to reflect the new figures.   The chart will now morph from old to new when you advance the slides.  <answer72301> I also wanted this effect , and am getting close to what I want by setting the first slide transition to 'Magic Move' with zero delay and Start Transition on 'Automatically', and then duplicating the first slide about 25 times, and incrementing each segment data value on each slide to get close to 'smooth clock winding' action on 'Play'  <comment51107> Nice question, I'm going to keep an eye on this one <comment51130> Please clarify what you're trying to do here. Are you asking for the ability to dynamically change the chart based on numbers you input during a presentation? Do you want to automatically re/create the animation based on numbers? Or are you just looking for the best way to create this animation for a given set of values? <comment51745> Not entirely what I wanted, but close enough :) Thanks! <comment51787> I suspected you wanted an animation based on the individual parts. AFAIK, it's not possible with the Keynote tools. Best answer I could provide. I'm a simple slide advocate anyway: wow 'em with your [information](http://www.principiae.be/), not with wizzy special effects.

I find, however, that one (short) animation on a slide transition works well to keep students' attention :) <comment51815> I'm not judging. At least not until I have sit through the preso. ;) <comment91247> Nice expansion!
