Is there any quick numerical data logger/collector on Mac? <body> For example, I may log in the battery percentage, my weight, or money. After some time of use, I may analyze the change with time. An example app on iOS is Loggr. I hope there is something similar (and more powerful) on OS X.  <comment142154> Would you like to see number of loads from the battery and how much % it still works? Or what do you exactly want? <comment142158> @Robuust, I want to input the data manually (with time auto stamped), and then be able to analyze it.
