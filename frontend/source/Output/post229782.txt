Error when using "pmset sleepnow" <body> Whenever I use codepmset sleepnow/code in Terminal (even with codesudo/code) I get this error: codeUnable to sleep system: error 0xe00002e2/code. I have no idea what's going on. Please help!  <answer239063> I struggled with the problem for months without any luck; the computer was unable to sleep, the sleep option on the apple menu was greyed out, pmset -g assertions (the most popular suggested solution to find ongoing processes) didn't return any result, and resetting the SMC didn't work. Today I finally found the solution that worked for mine  precodesudo pmset -a disablesleep 0 /code/pre  Hope this works for others too!  <comment280389> Are you on the latest version of your firmware? [This thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1945174?start=0&tstart=0) mentions that there were problems with old firmware. <comment280404> I don't have any updates available in the App Store... Does that mean I have the latest firmware? <comment280548> No, firmware updates don't show up on the app store. Follow [this guide.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201518) <comment280573> Followed it; I have the latest FW version for my model. <comment280588> Afraid I don't know then, sorry. <comment293289> Is there anything related in `/var/log/system.log`? Also can you please run `pmset -g assertions` and add the results to the question? <comment293306> Welcome to Ask Different!  The background info is good, but the info about the solution seems to be missing.  Can you provide some details, links, or references? <comment293334> I haven't updated this in a while. My Mac is part of the Apple Management thing, and no sleep is a known issue caused by that.
