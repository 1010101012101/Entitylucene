Iphone 3G internet disconnects frequently <body> I have an Iphone 3G with ios 4.2.1. I am using internet on my phone using Cellular data turned ON. It works fine for some time, but after then it disconnects and does not work untill i restart my phone. What is the issue.  <answer32576> Some phones do not strongre-login to the celluar network/strong once disconnected. That's why a restart helps.  However, try strong"Reset Network Settings"/strong on the iphone.  <comment39106> Was your problems solved? I'd be helpful to improve this site by providing feedback no matter if an answer worked or not.
