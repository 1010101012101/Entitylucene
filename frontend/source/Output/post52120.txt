Running (Perl's) CPAN in OS X: error "Can't open perl script –MCPAN" <body> All the instructions I can find for running CPAN on Mac OS X (eg. 1, 2 &amp; 3) say to start by running this command in terminal:  precodesudo perl –MCPAN –e shell /code/pre  However when I do so I get this error:  precodeCan't open perl script "–MCPAN": No such file or directory /code/pre  Why is this and how can I fix it? I'm running Lion (10.7.3) and have installed XCode 4.2.1.  <answer52137> Try this:   sudo cpan  cpan is an executable that comes installed in OS X (or installs with Xcode).
