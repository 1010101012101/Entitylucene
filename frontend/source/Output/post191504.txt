Printer Drivers for old models of Samsung, Xerox or Dell printers ( like Samsung ML-1520) <body> I've got a quite old Samsung printer, model ML-1520. I can not find any drivers for it. Samsung seems to have stopped supporting OS X, and Apple only offers drivers for models not older than ML-1630.  I've tried to install the drivers by Apple and setup my printer as 1630 and other models, but it doesn't print.  Where can I find proper drivers?  sub(I'm writing both Q&amp;A. For the purpose of search optimization I've added extra vendors in the header. My solution is applicable to all those vendors)./sub  <answer191505> First to do: check if your printer is supported by Apple. It was not true in my case, but may be true in yours.  There are at least two opensource driver packages, supporting the printers which are abandoned by their vendors:  h1SpliX./h1     a set of CUPS Printer drivers for SPL (Samsung Printer Language) printers. If you have a such printer, you need to download and use SpliX.   strongSupported Printers/strong  ul liDell 1100, 1110/li liSamsung CLP-200, CLP-300, CLP-500, CLP-600, CLP-610, CLX-216X, CLX-2170, CLX-3160, ML-1510, ML-1520, ML-1610, ML-1630, ML-1710, ML-1740, ML-1750, ML-2010, ML-2150, ML-2250, ML-2510, ML-2550, ML-2571, ML-3050, ML-3560/li liXerox Phaser 3115, 3116, 3117, 3120, 3121, 3122, 3130, 3150, 3420, 3425, 5500, 6100, 6110/li /ul  h1Samsung-GDI for Mac OS X/h1  strongSupported Printers/strong  ul liGeneric GDI Printer/li liLexmark/li liSamsung ML-200, ML-210, ML-1000, ML-1010, ML-1020, ML-1200, ML-1210, ML-1220, ML-1410, ML-1430, ML-1440, ML-1510, ML-1520, ML-1610, ML-1710, ML-1740, ML-1750, ML-2010, ML-2150, ML-2250, ML-2550, ML-4500, ML-5080, ML-6040/li /ul  h1Personal experience/h1  I first installed SpliX and it worked well with documents printed from MS Word or PDFs. But it failed with printing code.jpg/code images from Preview app or command-line codelpr/code utility. So I switched to Samsung-GDI, which handles code.jpg/code well.  Also, if a printer is set up twice with different drivers it doesn't work with any of them. So you should only have one printer in codeSettings/code  codePrinters/code (per each device). You can have both driver packs installed on your system, though.  Similar problem was discussed in Xerox 3117 driver for OS X Yosemite
