OS X 10.9.5 hangs with grey spinner; safe mode last message is "payload 2: device was reinitialized" <body> I had to hard-reset my 2013 Retina MacBook Pro because Chrome interrupt-froze the machine (it does this every now and then when you have like ~100 tabs open; hard-reset by holding power down has always worked until now).  The machine would not get past the grey boot screen having the spinner, not even after minutes waiting. There are no other things connected than the power adapter.  I did the standard things to revive things:  ol liSafe mode boot (hangs as well)/li liNVRAM reset/li liSMC reset/li lisingle user mode codefsck -fy/code (telling me codeappears to be OK/code)/li liboot in rescue mode and check everything with Disk Utility (says everything is fine)/li liafter 5. performed the various Disk Utility repairs (including permissions)/li liboot in verbose mode (see screenshot below) even after waiting 30 minutes/li limake image backup of codeMacintosh HD/code and restore it via Disk Utility which doesn't help (and took almost a full day for the process)/li /ol  The verbose boot does not get past this message:  precodeAppleUSBMultitouchDriver::checkStatus - received Status Packet, Payload 2: device was reinitialized /code/pre  Before I reinstall Mavericks with codeCmd-R/code and a working fiber internet connection, then restore from the image backup (or a few days old Time Machine backup) which takes at least another half day:  ul liWhat should the boot log look like after the above message?/li liWhat are my options for repairing?/li /ul  I think my problem is very similar to the last message in Macbook pro 10.8.3 Safe boot hangs (which is also about OS X 10.9.5) which never got more response (likekly because it was in the wrong thread).
