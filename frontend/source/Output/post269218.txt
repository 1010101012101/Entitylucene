"Shared with" option for iphone calendar is not showing <body> I have an iphone 6s with the current ios. I accidentally deleted a calendar. A quick search on google showed me how to "reverse the restore". Unfortunately this unshared and deleted all calendars from my family members' phones. They still showed to be shared within my phone calendar however. My default calendar was set to an icloud calendar. I tried to remove the people with whom I had shared calendars and then re-share with them, but it did not work. However, I logged into icloud.com and was able to click on the sideways wifi symbol to share with other people. This worked and the calendars automatically reappeared in their phones. However, within my phone, they did not show they were shared, nor did they alert me of any changes. And I still have no "share with" option within my phone calendar. PLEASE HELP!!!
