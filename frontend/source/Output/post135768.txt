How can I connect two VGA monitors to a Mini using Thunderbolt and HDM adapters? <body> I am running one VGA display using Thunderbolt/VGA adapter from Apple and it works fine.  Trying to connect second VGA display using HDMI/DVI adapter which comes with the mac using an additional connector DVI to VGA, but nothing happens!  I only have VGA monitors, so question is can this be got to work in some way ?  <answer135770> You cannot run VGA from the HDMI port the way you have it set up.  You need a direct HDMI-VGA converter.  The reason is that HDMI does not output analog signals.  The cable head actually has a digital-to-analog converter chip in it, but your HDMI&lt;-DVI adapter does not.  So even though the DVI&lt;-VGA adapter fits, the analog pins aren't actually connected.  Technically, the HDMI&lt;-DVI converter you're using was manufactured incorrectly.  They should have used a DVI-D connector, but they used a DVI-I instead.  A VGA adapter will not fit onto a DVI-D connector, but a DVI-I connector will accommodate anything.
