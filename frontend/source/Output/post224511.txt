How to use bash as default shell <body> I am running El Capitan 10.11.3 with bash version 3.x so I decided to update bash via:  precodebrew install bash /code/pre  Brew places the new bash under /usr/local/Cellar/bash:  precodebrew info bash  bash: stable 4.3.42 (bottled), devel 4.4-beta, HEAD Bourne-Again SHell, a UNIX command interpreter https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/ /usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.3.42 (59 files, 7.3M) * Poured from bottle From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/bash.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Required: readline âœ” ==&gt; Caveats In order to use this build of bash as your login shell, it must be added to /etc/shells. /code/pre  As you can see brew mentions that I need to update code/etc/shells/code in order to use the new bash. But after closing/reopening the current shell codebash --version/codetells me that now I am already using 4.3.42 so I wonder what happened under the hood that the new version is automatically used?  <answer224519> You can use the chsh command to change your shell.  In your case, with brew generated bash, you should set it to code/usr/local/bin/bash/code.  You should also put this in code/etc/shells/code.  As to your question codeecho $BASH_VERSION/code will tell you the version of the emcurrent/em shell. codebash --version/code tells you the version of the first bash in your code$PATH/code.  So the way you were looking at the version was not telling you the version that you were running.  <answer232983> precodebrew install bash sudo nano /etc/shells  # add to last line /usr/local/bin/bash  # save and quit via kntrl + x /code/pre  Now, you need to see something like this:  precodecat /etc/shells  # List of acceptable shells for chpass(1). # Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using # one of these shells.  /bin/bash /bin/csh /bin/ksh /bin/sh /bin/tcsh /bin/zsh /usr/local/bin/bash  # we added this! /code/pre  Now set your default shell:  precodechsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash $USER # this will set for the current user. /code/pre  Now quit Terminal and re-open it! Check if all ok?  precodeecho $BASH_VERSION # 4.3.42(1)-release /code/pre  <comment272286> How  did you  closing/reopening the current shell ? <comment272287> @Mark right click on terminal icon - quit, left click on terminal icon <comment272291> Ok I think I understand. But doesn't that mean brew modified my path an put /usr/local/bash to path? Or is /usr/local/bash default in PATH? <comment272298> Ok `sudo stat -x /etc/paths` tells me that it was not modified by brew (you will need sudo anyway). So it must be default. And I think you are right, after doing your steps echo $BASH_VERSION does now return 4.3.42. Thank Merm!
