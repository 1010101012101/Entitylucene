Garbled text in PDF file when using Preview in macOS 10.12.1 <body> I'm having issues with garbled text appearing in a PDF file when using Preview in macOS. I've tried  using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, but when the app attempts to load this file, it will state that it cannot extract the embedded font 'AJPGJM+Arial'. The fonts aren't garbled but some texts are missing in the PDF file.  Does anyone know how I can work around this problem?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MctAz.png" alt="Sample garbled text"  <comment327504> Where are the PDF files sourced from? It is very possible the creator of the PDF files has a corrupted font or fonts, or that the file(s) were uploaded incorrectly in the wrong format. <comment327628> Here's the source: http://www.docfoc.com/d59428pdf  I know my classmates were able to download this document and view it properly. It seems to be a problem specific to my mac. I asked him to send me his version and the text once again appeared garbled like this. <comment327651> Preview gave me the garbled text as you have experienced. Acrobat Pro (10.1.1) opens it without the garbled text. Looking at the Document Properties of this PDF in Acrobat Pro, this file was generated from PowerPoint and produced by Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows.) In addition to the embedded subsets of Arial in Ansi encoded TrueType fonts, there are embedded Arial and Arial Unicode TrueType (CID) fonts with an Identity-H encoding. These fonts are double-byte, complex or "Asian" fonts, and may be causing the problem if you don't have them installed on your system. <comment327816> Thanks for getting back to me. Is there a link where I can obtain these fonts to view the file without having to shell out $500 for Acrobat Pro? <comment327875> These fonts are most likely on the device where the PDF was created, and because the device was running Windows, the font(s) may not even be available for macOS. It may be wise to report this incompatibility and request that the PDF be made more compatible. The originator may not even realize there are double-byte fonts being embedded in the document.
