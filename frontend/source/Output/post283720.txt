My Toshiba W73600-H 2TB external disappeared from my Finder <body> I tried the suggestion from @klanomath and got the following info from Terminal.app  Numbers 3 and 5 constitute the missing drive.  Now - how do I get it to mount?  precodeGraphicss-MBP:~ graphicscafe$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *240.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Confidential            199.5 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:          Apple_CoreStorage Confidential            39.6 GB    disk0s4    5:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk0s5 /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Cafe Drive             +199.1 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  46C5E5EF-9253-4E33-B834-B82E239EACBA                                  Unlocked Encrypted /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:     FDisk_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2    1:                  Apple_HFS Graphics &amp; Suppoprt     2.0 TB     disk2s1 /dev/disk3 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                  Apple_HFS Confidential           +39.2 GB    disk3                                  Logical Volume on disk0s4                                  8E9F82D0-C119-405D-96AA-6E83B979A539                                  Unlocked Encrypted /code/pre  <comment357739> Could you link klanomath's answer/comment? (click "share" below it, copy the web address, then click "edit" here and paste in the link) <comment357788> You're not seeing it in Finder because it's not being seen by diskutil.  If you unplug it and plug it back it, does it show up? <comment358079> No, I've tried everything.  Doesn't show in DU, Finder, not even in the terminal with the "disklist" prompt. (I was mistaken about the Terminal in the previous post. It's (1 of 2) 2TB externals so it doesn't show)I think it's fried.
