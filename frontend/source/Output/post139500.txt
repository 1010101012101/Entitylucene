Stolen iPhone 3GS, iOS 6.1.6 - Will the thief be able to factory reset it and render my Find My iPhone useless? <body> My iPhone 3GS was stolen yesterday. Its battery was dying so I wasn't able to track it in time after I found out. Will the thief be able to factory reset the phone using iTunes or other means? I have read that iOS 7 prevents thieves from restoring or turning off Find My iPhone by asking for your iCloud details.  <answer139512> Well, first of all, you strongreally probably/strong don't have iOS 7 running on your iPhone 3gs, since iOS 7 is only compatible with these devices : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/69bji.png" alt="enter image description here"    emI'll answer to your question anyway.../embr Apple have effectively introduced a new security functionality in iOS 7 called "Activation Lock" which makes it strongtheoretically impossible to use the phone, even if you reset it/strong, as long as "Find my iPhone" was activated on the device.br The problem is that recently, it looks like a group of hackers have been able to bypass this protection, strongso unfortunately it looks like it would be possible for the thief to reset the phone and use it anyway./strong    emSince we apparently know from where this security breach comes from, Apple will probably fix this issue in upcoming updated, anyway, for you, it might be too late already and if you hadn't a device running iOS 7, it will be completely possible for the stealer of your phone to use it ./em
