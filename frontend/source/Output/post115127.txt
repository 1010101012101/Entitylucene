Change compile configuration of package installation in brew <body> How can I change the compiler configuration when I use brew install? I want to compile vim with +farsi using brew. But it seems that +farsi is not available options in brew:  precode$ brew install +farsi vim Error: No available formula for +farsi /code/pre  I also tried this command:  precode$ brew install vim --+farsi ==&gt; Downloading http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/v/vim/vim_7.4.052.orig.tar.gz Already downloaded: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/vim-7.4.052.tar.gz ==&gt; Patching patching file src/auto/configure patching file src/osdef.sh patching file src/os_mac.h ==&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --mandir=/usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.4.052/share/man --enable-multibyte --with-tlib=ncur ==&gt; make ==&gt; make install prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.4.052 STRIP=/usr/bin/true /code/pre  But still +farsi is not compiled with vim:  precode[ben@thebeast ~/vim/vim74]$ vim --version VIM - Vi IMproved 7.3 (2010 Aug 15, compiled Aug 24 2013 18:58:47) Compiled by root@apple.com Normal version without GUI.  Features included (+) or not (-): -farsi /code/pre  In fact the only options available are these:  precode$ brew options vim --disable-nls     Build vim without National Language Support (translated messages, keymaps) --override-system-vi     Override system vi --with-client-server     Enable client/server mode --with-lua     Build vim with lua support --with-mzscheme     Build vim with mzscheme support --with-perl     Build vim with perl support --with-python3     Build vim with python3 support --with-tcl     Build vim with tcl support --without-python     Build vim without python support --without-ruby     Build vim without ruby support --HEAD     install HEAD version /code/pre  Does this means that only subset of configurations are available in brew?  <answer115435> You can edit the brew's formula for vim which is probably at code/usr/local/Library/Formula/code and in file named codevim.rb/code. You can edit this file and add your needed options in the lines where it execute the compilation process such as codesystem "make"/code or   precodesystem "./configure", "--prefix=#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}",                       "--mandir=#{man}",                       "--enable-multibyte",                       "--with-tlib=ncurses",                       "--enable-cscope",                       "--with-features=huge",                       "--with-compiledby=Homebrew",                       *opts /code/pre  I don't think that it just implement some of the options, brew dynamically creates the compile options according to the application's compilation process and makefiles.  <answer115709> ol licodebrew install vim/code installs vim em7.4.052/em/li licodevim --version/code reports version em7.3/em/li /ol  From above observation it is clearly apparent that these are two different vims. By executing codevim --version/code you are invoking vim supplied as part of OS X (you can check this by codewhich vim/code, which is going to report em/usr/bin/vim/em, while brew-built programs are usually located under em/usr/local/em directory.  To edit vim formula you just execute codebrew edit vim/code, yet you do not need to do this just to get your desired farsi support. As you can see from Vim Feature Table, farsi support is included with any build compiled with code--with-features=big/code or huge. As brew builds are compiled with code--with-features=huge/code, they already contain farsi support.     /usr/local/bin/vim --versionbr/   VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Jan  1 2014 14:31:50)br/   MacOS X (unix) versionbr/   Included patches: 1-52br/   Compiled by Homebrewbr/   Huge version without GUI.

This is the vim installed by brew not the vim installed  by OS X. However still when I execute "vim --version" I get -farsi. It seems like "brew install" does not listen to the edit file and does not compile it with huge option. Any idea how I can debug this? <comment135901> @Dane Does `/usr/local/bin/vim --version` also show _-farsi_?
