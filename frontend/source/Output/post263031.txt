Decrypting External HD: The target Core Storage volume is not encrypted <body> Thanks to all the amazing people who are active and supportive on forums!  strongSituation:/strong  I need to decrypt my 2TB WD My Passport external hard drive. I know the password.  My main hard drive is not encrypted, I don't have FileVault turned on for anything, in case that's relevant.  I can't just back it up and reformat the drive, this is precisely what I'm trying to avoid and why I'm asking for help.  I'm Running OSX Sierra 10.12.1 on a Macbook Pro mid 2012 with 16GB RAM / 1TB SSD / 2.5GHz Intel i5)  strongHistory:/strong  I encrypted the external HD using Mac OS interface probably back in the days of OSX Lion or so. I mention that because I didn't use WD's onboard encryption software which makes multiple partitions etc. Also because as we'll see later on the OS it was encrypted under might be relevant.  In OSX Sierra Disk Utility there are no longer any encryption/decryption options in menus, just the option to change the password on something that's already encrypted.  When I command click on the drive in finder and select Decrypt "Pandora" (the name of my External HD), I'm prompted for the drive's password and then receive an error dialogue saying:  strong"The target Core Storage volume is not encrypted."/strong  After hours of online research I found that I could use the terminal to list the status of all drives.  The command:  precodediskutil list; diskutil cs list; /code/pre  Produced these results regarding the external drive:  precode/dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *2.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage Pandora                 2.0 TB     disk2s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Boot OS X               134.2 MB   disk2s3   /dev/disk3 (external, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            Pandora                +2.0 TB     disk3                                  Logical Volume on disk2s2                                  277C8F7E-2C3F-4B9F-A241-85317DFE1367                                  Unlocked Encrypted   +-- Logical Volume Group 242B340A-FF48-42C2-B05A-5B011C948FEE     =========================================================     Name:         Pandora     Status:       Online     Size:         2000021315584 B (2.0 TB)     Free Space:   0 B (0 B)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume 2D4253B7-3579-4808-A0DF-6D41962D7CD0     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk2s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     2000021315584 B (2.0 TB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family EDD5D6FE-AE7B-4E9E-A7A4-AA75D8B7A1EB         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Conversion Status:       NoConversion         High Level Queries:      Fully Secure         |                        Passphrase Required         |                        Accepts New Users         |                        Has Visible Users         |                        Has Volume Key         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 277C8F7E-2C3F-4B9F-A241-85317DFE1367             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk3             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          1999585103872 B (2.0 TB)             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               Pandora             Volume Name:           Pandora             Content Hint:          Apple_HFS /code/pre  After reading advice on various forums, here and on reddit strings etc. I used the UUID reference (long string starting 277C8F7E...) to run the following command:  precodediskutil cs decryptVolume 277C8F7E-2C3F-4B9F-A241-85317DFE1367 /code/pre  (passphrase prompt)  Result:  precodeThe Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is 277C8F7E-2C3F-4B9F-A241-85317DFE1367 Started CoreStorage operation on disk3 Pandora Error: -69755: The target Core Storage volume is not encrypted /code/pre  and then this command:  precodediskutil cs revert 277C8F7E-2C3F-4B9F-A241-85317DFE1367 /code/pre  (passphrase prompt)  Result:  precodeError: -69741: The target disk isn't eligible for reversion because it wasn't created by conversion or it is not part of a simple setup of exactly one logical and one physical volume /code/pre  ==========  Prompted by this, I tried dozens of combinations of 'repairVolume' 'unlockVolume' 'revert' and 'decryptVolume' with no change. I also tried on other UUID referenced elements of the external hard drive, all returning 'not possible' errors.  Disk Utility First Aid, WD's own suite of repair mechanisms, Volume Repair on third party software all insist the drive is perfectly fine. I also updated the HD with new WD drivers.  I have seen people respond on forums 'back up the data and reformat the disk' but this is simply not an option for me - it is precisely what I'm trying to avoid. In order to move the data onto our new NAS, I need to decrypt it so it can connect via the NAS' USB port rather than waiting for days for it to transfer through a computer over network etc etc.  I suspect that since OSX Yosemite and Sierra have phased out a lot of functionality in Disk Utility, and this was encrypted on an earlier OS, maybe it's decryption is no longer supported? I find that strange as it is able to interact with it's encryption fine and even change the password on it, just not use that password to disable that password.  There are plenty of forum threads where people have encountered a similar issue, mostly to do with FileVault on their internal startup volume, so this is clearly a recurring issue.  Help please? (It would be kind if you could look through the steps I've already taken before suggesting classic solutions)  <comment329524> Does the encrypted external volume contain a bootable system? <comment330114> No it doesn't - it's just a regular external hard drive with important data on it...
