Fix localhost cant provide a secure connection <body> I accidently configured  a web-app to force a secure connection i.e. https, and although I have turned this off, I cannot get chrome to forget this error, so whenever I ask for the url of my local development server;  precode http://localhost:3000/ /code/pre  Chrome instead returns  precodehttps://localhost:3000/ /code/pre  and gives the error  precodeThis site canâ€™t provide a secure connection /code/pre  I have tried codeChrome/Clear Browsing data/code and this does not help.  The app uses ruby on rails and the secure connection was done by setting   config.force_ssl = true.  How do I fix this?   <answer266793> As this is only your development site on localhost, and not a real domain name, you can solve the problem in Chrome by opening the following URL:  precodechrome://net-internals/#hsts /code/pre  You must open this URL in Chrome.  From there you get the settings for HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). Then under "Delete domain" put in localhost and delete it from the list.  If you have used other local names than localhost to refer to your development setup, delete those as well.  <answer267052> I ended up going for the nuclear option, uninstalling chrome and using this post to delete all my google-chrome data. It worked. Note that just uninstalling chrome did not work.  <comment334244> Out of curiosity, does the same thing happen when using a different browser (e.g. Firefox, Safari)? I'm asking to see if it's an issue with Chrome or perhaps http/https redirection on the app <comment334248> Exactly how did you configure your app to force a secure connection? Did you use a HTTP redirect? - If so, was it 301, 307, or?  - Or did you use HSTS to force a secure connection? If so, with which parameters? - The answers to these questions are necessary in order to determine what you need to do to solve your problem. <comment334532> It is a ruby on rails app, and I put in the configuration file ``` config.force_ssl = true```. if you look here, http://stackoverflow.com/a/39476254/1299362, you can see that it does quite a lot.  I can see why jsoegaard asked how it was configured, quite a lot happens. I will edit the question to include this information. <comment334533> Dials Mavis, it affects Firefox and Safari, but just resetting the cache fixes it for those browsers. <comment334995> Tried deleting localhost, localhost:3000, 0.0.0.0, 0.0.0.0:3000, 127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.1:3000, all to no avail. <comment353000> deleting `localhost` and also clearing `chrome://history/` did it for me
