Why does my Keyboard not allow me to finish writing my e-mail, but work otherwise? Video Link <body> MacBook Pro (Late 2011), OS X 10.10.4.  Increasingly Mail.app (Ver. 8.2) and Chrome (Version 43.0.2357.130 (64-bit)) do not allow me to type the rest of my input.  This evening it happened and was able to take this 9 second screen capture. (YouTube Link).  You can see that despite furious typing (shown on the Keyboard viewer) I simply cannot type the rest of my sentence.  Switching apps with alt + Tab, however, works fine.  Where do I begin to investigate this?  Still to try:  • Replicating under safe bootbr • Replicating with different userbr • Resetting PRAM (or whatever it is called nowadays)    Who can help?  <comment232132> please make your video "public" not private. <comment232133> The video is private. So I can't watch but it sounds like the problem experienced. I have the problem when a specific app is open. In my case I can narrow it down to _Docear_ or _Remind Me Later_. I reset PRAM and that seemed to help. Atleast the behaviour occurs less frequently. If I do not open the apps the behaviour does not occur. I think it is some kind of window focus bug. Sadly I have not found a final solution to this behaviour. <comment232181> Video still private... <comment232200> Video no longer private
