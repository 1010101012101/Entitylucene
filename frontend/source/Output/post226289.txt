Missing bash prompt <body> My bash prompt is missing as shown on the image. I'm not even sure how to open the .bash_profile since dot files are hidden in the finder.br I restarted the machine to no avail.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VPIVI.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226291> Setting aside the problem with your shell - there are lots of ways to get to a clean prompt:  ul limake a new user account and use that command line to become root: codesudo -s/code and then go in and nuke/fix/move your files/li /ul  You also could try booting to single user mode, mounting the filesystem read+write and cleaning things. I'd go the new user route since you can log out of your user without needing a restart.  <answer226295> If its a problem with your bash startup scripts you should be able to use the terminal menu item "New Command..." and run "bash --noprofile --norc".  But it may not be this.  <answer226396> What happens if you change your login shell? System prefs  users and groups  unlock, bottom left  right click your username  advanced options  login shell.  <answer277450> ctrl + C.   might work. works for me. glad it did!  <comment274783> Can we presume if you type something like `open -a TextEdit ~/.bash_profile` nothing happens? <comment274785> correct, nothing happens. open command nor nano command gives any output. I am logged in as a user, not as admin. but it was working before :( <comment274799> Have you tried Ctrl-C?
