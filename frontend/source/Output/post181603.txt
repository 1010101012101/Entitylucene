Have 2 different configurations for the same SSID <body> Let's say 2 different locations have the same WiFi name "MyPlace".  Each have their own configuration, password, etc... Different companies, they just happen to have the same name.  If I save one on my macbook, I won't be able to connect to the second one. I have to remove my configuration and do it again from scratch, every time I move from one location to the other.  Is there an easier way to keep the configuration to connect to 2 SSIDs?
