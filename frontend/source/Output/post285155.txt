I can't change my App Store <body> I want to change my App Store (Myanmar) to US App Store. But I can't. Because I have an amount of $0.15 left, that is my problem. How can I solve this problem?  <comment359565> Welcome to Ask Different! :) Having $0.15 in your account has no bearing on being able to change your Apple Store. Can you please edit your question to explain *how* you're trying to change stores?
