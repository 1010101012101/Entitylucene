Can GarageBand's yellow edit bar be shortened to less than 5 seconds? <body> I'm trying to export a 2 second sound from GarageBand, and I've seen other posts here (please link to them) that recommend turing on the cycle region button and adjusting the yellow bar that appears above my tracks.    My problem is that the yellow bar will not shorten to less than 5 seconds.  I use GarageBand on iOS version X.  <comment73276> Are you sure about the time scale?  I'm seeing that the minimum cycle region size is 0.5 seconds. <comment73413> Yes I'm sure of the time scale. <comment75225> @FierceMonkey As bmike mentioned in his edit comment, can you please provide the iOS version you're using and links to the other posts here you mention?
