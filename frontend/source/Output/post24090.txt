iMovie HD gives me "File missing" warning all the time <body> I am having a problem with iMovie HD giving me the "File missing" warning every time I open up a project. I work in FCE 4, export the movie to DV or MOV, then import it into iMovie HD to add chapter markers. My problem is that I import the movie file into iMovie HD, add chapter markers, and any other final touches, save and close it. When I open the project, it gives me the "File missing" warning, but then almost immediately follows it up with "Files were found in the Trash:" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u6kOH.jpg" alt="Stray files were found in Trash"br When I view the Trash, I find the file that I'd imported. Why is iMovie doing this? What did I do wrong? Or is it iMovie? Are you having this problem too?
