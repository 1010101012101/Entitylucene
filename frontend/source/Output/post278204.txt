How can I ensure that all SMS appear on the iPhone and not just on the computer? <body> Twice recently I've missed important messages because they were routed to the "Messages" app on my Macbook and not to the iPhone, even though it was active. I don't really care what the app does, but I care very much that messages do strongnot/strong bypass the phone, because that means I will probably not see them!  The option "SMS forwarding" was already disabled. I have now disabled my Apple ID account in the Messages app on the computer, and the problem has not recurred. Is that enough, or does one have to more to ensure that people who think they've reached you have actually reached you, and not your unattended computer?  <comment350141> As far as I'm aware, switching off messages on the Mac is the only way to her certain - or shut it down when you're not there. See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/177751/missing-ios-imessage-showing-in-osx-messages/177768#177768 & linked question for my experience with it.
