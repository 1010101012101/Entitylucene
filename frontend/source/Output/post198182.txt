Do I need the DVD to reformat 2011 MacBook Pro with OS X Yosemite <body> I have a MacBook Pro from early 2011 which was shipped to me with a DVD that I could use to reformat the machine, which I do not have with me at the moment.  I have upgraded to OS X Yosemite though, and have reformatted the newer Retina MacBooks which used an Internet connection to download the OS.  Since I do not have the disc handy, will I be able to do this later reformatting on my older MacBook Pro?   <answer198186> If your MacBook Pro (early 2011) was updated with Macbook Pro EFI Firmware Update 2.3 then you will be able to use OS X Internet Recovery and not need the DVD that shipped with your Mac.  Also have a look at: OS X: About OS X Recovery  <comment237115> hmm I wonder how I can verify I have the needed firmware? <comment237118> @erikvold, What's the output from Terminal of the following command? `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep 'ROM'`
