Get full file path on shared network drive when mounted volume includes subfolder <body> We have a shared samba file server with paths like  precodesmb://server/folder1/folder2/file.txt /code/pre  It is common for people to "connect to server" directly to codesmb://server/folder1/folder2/code  This mounts a volume called "folder2".  We need the full path of the path, to share it e.g. codesmb://server/folder1/folder2/file.txt/code  <answer197169> precodemount  /code/pre  this command would show you the SMB URL, e.g //server/folder1/folder2/
