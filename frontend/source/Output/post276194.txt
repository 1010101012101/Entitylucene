Very poor rendering quality with my Macbook Thunderbolt 27'' <body> I have a MacBook Pro (2015) with an external Monitor Mac Thunderbolt (2013).   I've NEVER had a beautiful image on my external monitor, no matter the OS X version was.br At work, I'm working with an iMac, and despite being similar in specifications, the image is far better and cleaner than my monitor.   I use the default calibration and default resolution from the general settings.   I get a kind of yellow opacity, and the font is blurry.   Has anyone already experienced it and managed to solve it?   Considering the price it costed, I expect a great screen quality.    <comment347578> Have you tested the monitor with another Mac yet? <comment347584> I have two Macbook Pro (2012 and 2015), and with both the external monitor rendering isn't good enough. <comment347586> Then it's likely that some component of the monitor is just faulty.  :( <comment347592> Another possibility (if you've used the same cable and/or adapter with both MBPs) is a faulty cable and/or adapter.
