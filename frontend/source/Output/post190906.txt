The feature was designed to update your Facebook, Twitter and other feeds while your not in the app./li liSee what apps are using the most data (found under Settings  Cellular, then scroll down to emCellular Data Usage/em) you will be able to see a breakdown of what uses the most data, so you can prevent this problem from occurring again.  /li liMake sure iCloud Photo Library is off or has the function that only uploads photos on Wi-Fi. /li liThe App Store has recently been given privileges to update apps automatically, and iTunes can download new content automatically. Turn this off for cell data via Settings  iTunes &amp; App Store  Use Cellular Data./li /ol
