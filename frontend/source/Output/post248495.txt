Unremovable partition after trying to install ubuntu <body> I tried to install Ubuntu on my MacbookPro (mid 2015, OS X Yosemite) dual boot, using the following: How to Dual-Boot OS X and Ubuntu (PDF)  I was finishing up part 3 and Ubuntu was starting to download, until everything froze. Nothing was responding so I force shutdown my computer and now OS X seems to be working fine. However I have a partition disk0s3 (Linux Swap) and a bunch of Free Space I can't get rid of.  precode/dev/disk0 #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER 0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *251.0 GB   disk0 1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1 2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            182.6 GB   disk0s2 3:                 Linux Swap                         16.4 GB    disk0s3 /code/pre  I tried getting rid of them through Internet Recovery but that didn't work either. How can I get rid of the partition and the Free Space?  <answer248502> ol liTry: open Disk Utility, select the Linux Swap partition, in the toolbar there should be a delete disk option, try that, and try to remove the partition./li liIf 1 didn't work, try use First Aid in Disk Utility (first on the partition and then on the main drive)/li liIf 2 didn't work, try to boot in to Recovery Mode, select Disk Utility from the menu, and try option 1 and 2 again./li /ol  <answer248534> If you are using El Capitan (OS X 10.11), then the document you are referencing will not work as expected.  As for your question. The command below will remove the Linux Swap partition.  precodesudo diskutil erasevolume "Free Space" "" /dev/disk0s3 /code/pre  The next command expands your Macintosh HD volume to contain the free space.  precodesudo diskutil resizevolume /dev/disk0s2 R /code/pre     Note: I am not sure if the prefix codesudo/code is necessary. (But, it will do no harm if you include the codesudo/code)   <comment307949> In DiskUtility, I selected the partition and choose "Erase" at the top. But it failed with the error "MediaKit reports no such partition." <comment307950> Did you try in recovery mode? <comment307954> Recovery mode wasn't able to start up. The estimated time to start kept going up.  David's solution worked for me, however <comment307956> The first command didn't work (something about not being able to find that partition) but the second command got rid of the Free Space. <comment307957> What version of OS X are you using? Yosemite (OS X 10.10) will generate an error message when the first command is used, but the command still removes the partition. <comment307959> You have no recovery partition to boot to. If you did, then the partition would have appeared in your posted output of the `diskutil list` command. <comment308010> Actually, the *OS X Recovery over the Internet* keys are Command-Option-R.
