Mac Mail - Accounts & Contacts <body> Is there a way to restrict which account contacts are used by Mac Mail (10.3+)?  The idea here is that when creating a new email, I only want certain contacts from specific accounts to appear in the To field. At the moment it suggests all active accounts with contacts enabled.  I don't want to have to disable the other account's contacts as they are used for iMessage/FaceTime.  If not, can anyone suggest any other Mac Mail alternatives that are capable of restricting contacts?
