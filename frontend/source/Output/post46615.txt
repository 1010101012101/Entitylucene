No Sound from Mac Mini after OS X Server Reinstall <body> I had to reinstall OS X Lion Server 10.7 on my Mac mini (late 2011) due to partition and boot record corruption. Since reinstalling, I have not have sound. The only sound device that shows under Utilities  Sound is "Internal Speaker". Previously, "Headphones" also appeared. I have a Harman Kardon Soundsticks 2.1 sound system. It has only one sound connector. I always plugged it into the green port on the mini. It worked fine. Since reinstalling I have no sound at all. Any ideas out there? Solutions? I've been through the Cmd-P-R deal, reinstalled OS X Lion Server - all to no avail.   <answer54800> Go to code~/Library/Preferences/code and trash your codecom.apple.systemsound.plist file/code. Drag it right into the trash. Empty trash and restart your Mac.  A new plist file will generate automatically, look for the speaker/sound icon in your Finder menu. If that doesn't resolve the issue, try kbdCommand ⌘/kbd-kbdOption ⌥/kbd-kbdP/kbd-kbdR/kbd again during reboot and make sure you hear the Apple chime at least two times for a full recycle.  <comment53380> Are there any sound devices in System PreferencesSound?
