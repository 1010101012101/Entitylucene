File not visible in Finder <body> I've saved a file with the name codefilename\.svg/code and it didn't appear in finder. When I check terminal, there was a file named code.svg/code in the folder I saved my file. I changed its name to codetest.svg/code but it still doesn't appear in Finder. Here is a screenshot from terminal:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FI5xv.png" alt="Terminal ls output"  How can I make this file visible in Finder?  <answer222560> From this tutorial on MacWorld, here is a way to show hidden files in the Finder:  Open a terminal, and enter this command at the Bash prompt:  precode$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES /code/pre  Then restart the Finder with the following command (also from terminal):  precode$ killall Finder /code/pre  The next time you open a Finder window, your hidden files should be visible.  To echo what Oliver said, you can also use codechflags/code to alter the "hidden" property on a specific file. (chflags man page)  precodechflags nohidden hiddenfile.ext /code/pre  <answer222563> In order to make only this specific file visible in Finder, try the following command using codeTerminal.app/code from emApplications  Utilities/em:  precode$ cd /path-to-folder/where/invisible-file/is-located/ $ chflags nohidden ./test.svg /code/pre  Hope this helps  <comment269734> Nice.  I was just about to add that to my answer. <comment269797> There is no need to use `sudo` for `chflags`. Except for the target file permissions. <comment269832> @HamidRohani correct, i changed it. Thanks
