How do I change the format of the name in Terminal? <body> I don't know what this is called, can anyone clarify? Is it called the name / hostname. I don't know what you call it.  On Ubuntu my Terminal shows codekalima@coolbox:~$/code  But on OSX my Terminal shows codecompname:~ kalima$/code  Is this normal? Is there a way to change it so they're both consistent in format?  <answer292874> That's called your "prompt". You can define the codePS1/code variable to control it.  Add the following to your code~/.bashrc/code file:  precodePS1='\u@\h:\w\$ ' /code/pre  See the bash manual for more details.  <answer292879> You can also edit your code~/.bash_profile/code if you like having everything in one file.  For example, I have customized my terminal by adding this to my code~/.bash_profile/code.  precode    [[ -s ~/.bashrc ]] &amp;&amp; source ~/.bashrc      export CLICOLOR=1     export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced function prompt {   local BLACK="\[\033[0;30m\]"   local BLACKBOLD="\[\033[1;30m\]"   local RED="\[\033[0;31m\]"   local REDBOLD="\[\033[1;31m\]"   local GREEN="\[\033[0;32m\]"   local GREENBOLD="\[\033[1;32m\]"   local YELLOW="\[\033[0;33m\]"   local YELLOWBOLD="\[\033[1;33m\]"   local BLUE="\[\033[0;34m\]"   local BLUEBOLD="\[\033[1;34m\]"   local PURPLE="\[\033[0;35m\]"   local PURPLEBOLD="\[\033[1;35m\]"   local CYAN="\[\033[0;36m\]"   local CYANBOLD="\[\033[1;36m\]"   local WHITE="\[\033[0;37m\]"   local WHITEBOLD="\[\033[1;37m\]"   local RESETCOLOR="\[\e[00m\]"    export PS1="\n$RED\u $PURPLE@ $GREEN\w $RESETCOLOR$GREENBOLD\$(git branch 2&gt; /dev/null)\n $BLUE[\#] → $RESETCOLOR"   export PS2=" | → $RESETCOLOR" } /code/pre  Mine looks something like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GP7Bf.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment369495> I don't have a .bashrc file, I have .bash_history, .bash_profile, and .bash_sessions <comment369496> Go ahead a create it as a new file. Add this to your .bash_profile: `[[ -f ~/.bashrc ]] && source ~/.bashrc` <comment369497> What does that do? And is there any reason why I didn't have the file to begin with? Will there be some weird side effect somewhere else? <comment369522> PS1 and PS2 are shell-specific variables. They don't need to be exported, unless you have other programs that use them. <comment369524> bash's dot files can get a bit complicated. A bash session can be a login or a non-login shell (that depends on your terminal's options), and it can be interactive or non-interactive (running a shell script is an example of non-interactive). Different combinations of those attributes affect which dot files are processed. [See the manual for more](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Bash-Startup-Files). Typically, terminals launch a login shell, so we start with the .bash_profile. That doesn't by default read the .bashrc, so if that file exists, `source` it. <comment369526> @glenn jackman Most JetBrains products have a terminal option, and the export allows me to use them there as well.
