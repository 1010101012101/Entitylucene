/usr/local/bin/ not found by Automator and Java but exists in Terminal <body> Automator Shell Script  precodeecho $PATH eval /usr/libexec/path_helper -s echo $PATH /code/pre  Results:  after the first codeecho $PATH/code:  precode/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  after the second codeecho $PATH/code:  precode/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin /code/pre  As ImageMagick is installed in /usr/local/bin it means that it fails unless I mess with the PATH first anyone know where Automator (Java is the same) gets its path from and how to permanently add the missing paths  <answer233715> Automator uses the path variable hard coded in the kernel.  precodesysctl user.cs_path user.cs_path = /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Actually, this is the path set for a user's launchd and is then inherited by Automator when you launch the application.  precodelaunchctl getenv PATH /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin /code/pre  Use the absolute paths to your executables or modify the PATH in the Run Shell Script.  <comment285570> Seperate Lines echo $PATH  eval /usr/libexec/path_helper -s   echo $PATH <comment285573> Results  first echo = /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin second echo = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin <comment285574> I edited your question. Please check my mods <comment285585> The answers for Automator and Java will differ as the first is launched through the GUI and the second most cases will be via command line - there are many duplicates of both on this site <comment285613> Very interesting! +1  A simple `echo $PATH` in a Run Shell Script confirms this and I have had issues in the past and never checked this!  Now I know why I have had to hard code some paths! :) <comment285615> You can also add a `PATH= ...` statement, set to what's in the environment,  to the top of the Run Shell Script  and then not have to hard code the path to the executable.  You can add that to your answer if you want.
