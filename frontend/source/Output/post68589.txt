Multiple Sidebars in the finder <body> Is there a way to have multiple sidebars in Finder?   The Finder sidebar is useful for storing shortcuts to different folders. However it becomes lengthy quite quickly.  I want to have a different sidebar for each project I am working on, so each sidebar can contain different shortcuts to different folders.   Pathfinder does offer this functionality, but I find it a bit klunky to use and the program is quite expensive for just this one feature.   Are there any alternatives?  <answer81361> SwitchUp can swap out the Finder preferences and let you manager multiple sets of these preferences, which can give you different sidebars.  Watch the video on their website to get an idea of how it works.
