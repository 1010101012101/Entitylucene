QuickVoice recordings on iPad <body> I have a lot of QuickVoice recordings made and stored on my iPad (first generation)    I am attempting to backup to iCloud for the first time.  If this is successful, can I then delete the recordings from my iPad to create some much needed space?  If so, how do I retrieve any specific recordings from iCloud for later use?  <answer35987> You can sync your QuickVoice recordings with a PC or Mac using their software. Have a look at the QuickVoice website for information on the download and price, although it seems that you get a desktop version with the iOS version, which I didn't get so not sure where to get it.  This app does not use iCloud to sync, it uses its own cloud storage system.
