Is it true that Mac Air fan sleeps almost all time? <body> Hmm, while I was typing this question's title, some related questions appeared:  ul liair-11-i7-2011-fans-come-on-never-turn-off/li liis-it-normal-to-hear-the-macbook-fans-all-the-time-even-if-they-run-at-2000rpm/li /ul  So, now I'm confused a little, because some friend of mine who has Mac Air 2012 in maximum equipment told me that his fan is turned off almost ever.   Also he telling me that models of 2013 year should be more "cold".  And one more mind - are the some relation between CPU (i3/i7) and notebook temperature?  So, please help me to pick the right decision - I would like to buy notebook that will be maximum quiet.  <comment113709> I have MBA mid 2012, and the fans only run if I sit outside in 105 temperature, and even then it is so quiet I have to listen carefully to hear it. <comment113712> @Buscarì›ƒ awesome!
