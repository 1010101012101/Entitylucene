Sync Google contact groups to iPhone <body> New iPhone user (iPhone 7+) coming from Android. Love almost all things about this phone so far.  I do not own a Mac or iPad.  I use Google's Gmail for business and personal accounts.  I have about 1000 contacts between the personal and business accounts that are using groups in Google Contacts.  My most frustrating part is not being able to get my groups and contacts to come over to the phone.  I know I can setup the account and it will sync contacts, mails, calendars, etc. strongbut no groups/strong.  I need to keep 3 Google accounts separated and updated with groups and use Google as my main address that the iPhone will update Google with additions.    I am a little naive about this on iPhone at the moment.  I have downloaded contact sync for Google Gmail with auto sync app, but only syncs one Gmail account at time.
