LibreOffice Writer strikethrough custom shortcut with ⌥ + ⌫ not working <body> I tried to set a custom key combination to strikethrough selected text in LibreOffice Writer on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra 10.12.4, but it doesn't work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G89dm.png" alt="Strikethrough shortcut setting"  When I select my text and hit ⌥ + ⌫ it just deletes the selected text instead of applying the strikethrough format. But when I use the toolbar shortcut button it well works.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HooG6.png" alt="The text selected and striked wiuth toolbar button"  Any ideas?

Could that be the issue? <comment354848> Something's up. Are you using COMMAND + DELETE or OPTION + DELETE? Your shortcut reflects Cmd + Del, but your question reflects Option + Del. Note that either shortcut may be overridden by the built-in MacOS shortcuts (see this link for a full list: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236) <comment354879> @NoahL you are right. As i tried many combinations, i used the command screenshot. But both command and option keys shortcut fails...
