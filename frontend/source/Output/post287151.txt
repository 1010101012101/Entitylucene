If you mean safe, absolutely. The CPU temp looks a bit high to be in standby mode, but if it's running a few apps or other processes, that would explain the increased temperature. Everything looks safe to me. Notebook CPUs are designed to function at super high temperatures (they generally max out at about 103 C). I regularly have my MBP pushing 99 C running heavy tasks.
