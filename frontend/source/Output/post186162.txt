Deleting individual messages on Apple Watch <body> How do I delete individual text messages from my watch? I can delete them from my iPhone but I can't delete from my watch.   <answer186183> Per the user manual, deleting texts is an all-or-nothing action. It removes the whole conversation. There does not appear to be an option to remove a single text. (Similarly, you cannot delete one email out of a thread, only the whole thread.)  <answer187873> On the text page (with multiple conversations) swipe to the left the conversation you wish to delete, then tap TRASH, and TRASH again.  <comment222222> Welcome to Ask Different. The question is about to delete individual text messages, not conversations/threads.
