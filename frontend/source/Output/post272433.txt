Mac OS X Sierra Setup UDP port forwarding <body> I would like to utilise the Wi-Fi capabilities of my iMac for a music streaming device which requires the use of SSDP (a UDP based protocol) and is connected via ethernet to the iMac. If I use the regular MacOS internet connection sharing, I can get to the device via ICMP from another computer (i.e. the route is working).  However, it appears that the device's SSDP messages do not reach their destination or packages from the outside are not properly forwarded to the music streaming box. Is there any chance to fix that or to investigate this issue further? I've used wireshark so far but all I see is that there are SSDP packages on the en0 but not on the en1 interface.  Thanks in advance!  Edit: I've tried bridging but somehow the device seems to end up without an IP address (it is relying on DHCP).  <comment342410> Can you set to device's IP manually instead of using DHCP? If you are trying to use the iMac's ethernet _and_ wifi simultaneously, the answer to [this post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/47368/how-to-use-wifi-and-ethernet-at-the-same-time) will make it clear.
