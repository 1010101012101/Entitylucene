Terminal.app equivalent of `xterm -e 'cmd'` <body> With codexterm/code (and codegnome-terminal/code, codeterminator/code, etc), you can run the following command:  precode$ xterm -e 'vim somefile.txt' /code/pre  xterm will open and run the specified program (in this case, Vim). When the program exits, the terminal window closes as well. Running the above command, if you were to quit Vim, the terminal would go away as well.  Is there any way to get this (or similar) functionality through Terminal.app (on OSX)? The solution can be in AppleScript, Bash or anything else really, as long as it's achievable via commands I could run in a Bash script.  <answer117029> With AppleScript, you can do:  pre on run argv     set command to item 1 of argv --you can customize this to be constant     tell application "Terminal"         activate         do script (command & "; exit")     end tell end run /pre  This will open Terminal and tell it to run a command (Your default settings need to close the window when the shell exits).  To run this, just use codeosascript filename.scpt "$command_to_run"/code  <answer117109> You could use the codeopen/code command (code/usr/bin/open/code).   For example, say that I want to open  the file test.txt with Textmate and close the shell afterwards. I could use the following command:  precodeopen -W -a Textmate test.txt &amp;&amp; exit /code/pre  ul liThe code-W/code option will cause it to wait until Textmate is closed./li liThe code-A/code option allows you to specify the application/li /ul  The second part of the command line (codeexit/code) will not cause the Terminal emapplication/em to quit, but can close the Terminal emwindow/em if you change the default preferences. In the Terminal preferences, click on the emShell/em tab and change the setting emWhen the shell exits/em to emClose the window/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ofiw7.png" alt="Terminal preferences"  If you really want to exit the Terminal application, you could replace codeexit/code by a call to a Bash script. For example:  precode#!/bin/sh  echo | osascript &lt;&lt;EOF tell application "Terminal"   quit end tell EOF /code/pre  (Source adapted from Mac OS X Hints)  This will still cause Terminal to show a popup asking if you want to close the application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5iKHZ.png" alt="Terminal popup"  <comment135721> See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4404242/programmatically-launch-terminal-app-with-a-specified-command-and-custom-colors . <comment135723> That gets me to starting the terminal from the command line, which helps, but I still need to get it to run a program and close the window when that program exits.
