Show batch of notifications once in an hour <body> Lots of notifications distract from work but ignoring them is bad. Is there any possibility to receive all notifications like on every 0 minute of an hour.   Something like:  precode6:30 - New calendar notification [not shown, scheduled]   6:31 - New skype notification [not shown, scheduled]   6:45 - New slack notification [not shown, scheduled]   7:00 - Show all notifications [calendar, skype, slack] /code/pre  I tried to google how to do that, but I didn't find.   <comment347837> Is this for iOS or macOS or both?  Please add the relevant tags to your question. <comment347858> @fsb done :) It's for macos <comment347867> Thanks.  I don't think this is possible with native macOS (maybe others here  will know more about that) so are you open to using a 3rd-party application? <comment347910> Just use do not disturb and check your notifications every so often. That way you can check in between tasks instead of being interrupted by 10 notifications while you're in the zone. <comment347952> @fsb sure, I'm open :) If I knew macos development, I'd like to find something like interceptor for notifications <comment347953> @JBallin that's the manual way to do that, I'd prefer more automatic
