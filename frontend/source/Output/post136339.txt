"No definition found" <body> I recently restored my iPhone 5 from backup, and noticed that my dictionary always gives the message "No definition found" (although this could have started earlier and I just didn't notice until now). I tried selecting Manage from the bottom left of the empty dictionary message, then deleting and re-adding a dictionary; however, I still get the same message.  <answer136341> An Apple Support discussion, iPhone 5, my 'define' word feature no longer is an option. How can I get it back?, suggests the following:     ol   liGo to strongSettings  General  International  Language/strong/li   liChange the language to one of Apples supported languages like Spanish./li   liGo to your notepad, type "test", press hold, select the word, and click the "define" that now appears./li   liThis will tell you there is no current dictionary, and prompt for one to be downloaded./li   liAssure you are on a stable Wi-Fi network, and hit download./li   liOnce complete, go back to your language settings and switch back to your native language./li   liEnjoy your dictionary feature without having to "reset" your phone./li   /ol   <answer148988> ol liHighlight ("Select"), and try to "Define," a word./li liIf it comes up with "No definition found," click on "Manage" (lower left corner)./li liDownload your preferred dictionary from the Apple Cloud (by tapping on the appropriate cloud and arrow symbol)./li /ol  <answer204788> I just went into General - Language &amp; Region and in the preferred language order hit 'Add Language' (I selected French because this was a language I didn't already have). It then asked me which language I wanted to keep as my preferred default and I selected 'English'. It did its updating thing &amp; all was well. My definitions returned.   <answer223362> When you define a word and the no definition comes up. On the bottom left is "manage". Click that then chose a dictionary! Then try it again and you will see definitions!  <comment161757> 4 is not necessarily correct. In my case, there was a current dictionary. I deleted it, added it back, and added another one (just in case). That worked. <comment175519> Please note that the question specifies this had already been tried, and it didn't work.
