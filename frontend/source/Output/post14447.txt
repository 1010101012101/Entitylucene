How to delete Windows "locked" files? <body> My friend gave me a USB key that has Windows Viruses on it.  On my mac, when I try to delete them it fails and tells me that those files are "locked". I ran an anti-virus, which also was unable to delete them for the same reason.  <answer14463> There are two options for files that came from a Windows drive:  ol liRight click on the file and select "Get Info" (or mark all files and press codecommand/code + codealt/code + codei/code) to get the file information. There in the "General"-tab you can find and opt-out the "Locked"-option. Trash and delete them./li liOpen /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and type codecd /Volumes/YourDrive/code, then coderm -r thefile.exe/code. If that fails, try codesudo rm -r thefile.exe/code and enter your password. /li /ol  Mac has other steps if you can't unlock the file - see this article - TS1402 for details on immutable flags and if the directory permissions won't let you modify a file. The two above steps handle the vast majority of locked files on the mac.  <comment15577> I think I found the answer. In the command line I typed "sudo rm filename". <comment15701> I could not uncheck the "locked" option, but the "sudo" worked. Thanks
