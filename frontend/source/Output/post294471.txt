Echoes in playback <body> I am using a 2015 15" MacBook Pro, i7, 16GB RAM, Sierra 10.12.6. The sound quality is poor, especially when I use Bluetooth earbuds. After some research, I tested and purchased the Boom 3d Audio Enhancer. Ever since I installed it the palyback from some apps echoes. Primarily Chrome and our video conferencing app, Zoom. I uninstalled it and removed all of the files from the Libraries, restarted the coreaudio daemon, reloaded AppleHDA.kext and rebooted after each step. I even reinstalled Chrome.  Does anyone have any other ideas, other than wiping and starting over?  <comment371721> You uninstalled from inside Boom itself, using its own uninstaller?
