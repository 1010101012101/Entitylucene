Preview - Export to PDF without margins <body> Preview (like most Mac apps) can print to PDFs, and even has a shortcut for this functionality via a menu option codeExport as PDF.../code. I have a scanned document in code.tiff/code format that I'd like to convert to a PDF, but using the option above yields a PDF with large margins around the image file. Is there a reason why this is happening? More importantly, is there a way to suppress these margins?  <answer112559> Apologies if you've already tried this, but the only thing I can think to suggest is making sure that you use the "Show Details" button in the Print window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qt8so.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  And then once you have expanded it, adjust the 'scale' settings under 'preview'  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3kgI2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  You will probably emnot/em be able to make it "full bleed" -- I believe that Preview will always require emsome/em type of margin, but as you can see from the image here, it does not have to be very large.  (It also emmight/em matter which printer you have selected, as I believe the printer definition files tell Preview how much of a margin is required by each printer, but I could be wrong about that.)  <answer155355> If you don't want any borders, create a custom paper size and change paper size to 0 as shown below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBrvN.png" width="488" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILaxF.png" width="476"  Name your custom paper size, use it and create PDF.  <answer218734> ol liOpen your PDF document in Preview/li liGo to View - Thumbnails - you will see all the pages as thumbnails img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TAcaB.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liSelect all the Thumbnails in the tab opened in 2nd step/li liView  Show Markup Toolbar  select 'Rectangular selection' instrument on appeared Markup Toolbar/li liOn 'Content' view (where the PDF pages are actually displaying)  select the area you want to leave (this selection should be applied to each page in the document, because they were all selected in the 3rd step) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gnXJc.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liAfter selection is done - Crop button should appear - press it and you'll crop all the pages/li /ol  <comment132281> Nice catch, thanks :) <comment224338> This doesn't work.  0 mm still prints with margins. <comment249476> It worked for me. I had to make sure that the paper size was exactly the same ratio as the PDF size (in my case A4, 210x297mm). This is an easy way to combine Illustrator PDF's and reduce filesize at the same time. You can also enter NEGATIVE margins. <comment273731> Thank you! 210x297 without margins is the way to go for A4. <comment358543> NICE HACK!!!!!! (apologies for all the exclamation points - I had to get my comment over the minimum character count)
