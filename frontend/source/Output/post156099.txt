Wifi AWUS036NH working in 10.9 but with no Internet <body> I have got a Mavericks (10.9) installation on a Mac and a AWUS036NH WiFi card. There are several drivers to get WiFi card working. There is one of them in this page (http://store.rokland.com/pages/support) and another in the bear extender page, device that uses the same chipset.  The thing is that I installed the driver and the tool that is installed does the wifi connection to the router, its says that its connected but when I use the browser or other application, there is not internet.  Airport is disabled.  I dont know what can I do.  <answer156112> Try following these instructions. Condensed version is below.  Turn off Wi-Fi.  Open Finder, press Command+Shift+G then enter the path below and click Go:  precode/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/ /code/pre  Find and delete the following files (some may not exist):  precodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist com.apple.network.identification.plist NetworkInterfaces.plist preferences.plist /code/pre  Reboot.
