DNS resolution for a hostname in local network fails <body> From my OS X 10.11.4, I do:  precodeping ubuntu-workstation ping: cannot resolve ubuntu-workstation: Unknown host /code/pre  However, if I do the same from a windows laptop, the call is successfully resolved.  The three hosts (OS X computer, windows computer and ubuntu-workstation) are on the same local network.  Running command: codescutil --dns | grep 'resolver #1' -A 5/code, gives results:  precoderesolver #1   nameserver[0] : 193.231.252.1   nameserver[1] : 213.154.124.1   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Request A records Reachable -- resolver #1   nameserver[0] : 193.231.252.1   nameserver[1] : 213.154.124.1   if_index : 4 (en0)   flags    : Scoped, Request A records Reachable /code/pre  Running the command codecat /etc/resolv.conf/code returns thiese results:  precodenameserver 193.231.252.1 nameserver 213.154.124.1 /code/pre  Is this a known issue? How can I fix it?  <comment290270> In Terminal, type `scutil --dns | grep 'resolver #1' -A 5` and let me know what result you get. <comment290273> @Allan, I run the command, the output is in the question. <comment290275> Your DNS server for your mac is set **outside** your network (Bucharest, Romania).  It won't know anything about your internal network.  Can you issue the command `cat /etc/resolv.conf` and post the results? <comment290332> @Allan, I have posted the results. I am not sure how can I fix this? I have a home network with three computers and a Linksys E1000 router. <comment290370> I am away from my Mac at the moment, but if you can either edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and insert `nameserver Linksys IP Address` above those two entries or if you can put your Linksys IP in the DNS entry in your Network config, it should fix the problem <comment290445> @Allan, I have set my router IP address as the first line in /etc/resolv.conf, but still does not work. My Mac does not recognize Ubuntu desktop hostname. However Ubuntu desktop knows the Mac by the hostname. Also Windows knows Ubuntu desktop by hostname. <comment290452> Ok...try restarting mDNSResponder.  Isse these two commands: `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist` then issue... `sudo launchctl load -w  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist` <comment290455> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/39301/discussion-between-alex-and-allan).
