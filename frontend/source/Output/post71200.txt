iPad : how to set up to browse a private wireless network, not connected to the net, using only IP addresses? <body> I have a private wireless network setup that is not connected to the internet. There are only industrial controllers on this network and an iPad running an app that will control these systems. There is no DNS or NAT etc, as all the devices have static IP addresses, which we know.  Problem is as soon as I select the wireless network in settings, the iPad tries to pop up the browser and find something on the internet, as this fails, the iPad then drops the wireless connection.  How do I tell the iPad not to care if it cannot connect to the internet ?  This is happening with the current and past versions of OS  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
