Latest update of Apple iPhone 6s version 9.3.2 will not let me use most of my apps <body> I'm getting a "network error" code, no matter which Wi-Fi I am using.  How to resolve this issue?  <answer243477> Reset your Network Settings:  Settings  General  Reset and click "Reset Network Settings"  <comment299824> Try resetting your network settings. Settings  General  Reset  Reset Network Settings. <comment300003> I deleted two apps that wouldn't work, I reset the network setting as stated.  I powered down my iphone and then restarted it after 10 min.  I searched and re-installed the apps.  Still getting error message "network error" on the nest app.  and "network is not available." for starbucks app.  Although, I can get into Facebook.   Any optional ideas?  Thank you for your help. <comment300004> I deleted two apps that wouldn't work, I reset the network setting as stated.  I powered down my iphone and then restarted it after 10 min.
