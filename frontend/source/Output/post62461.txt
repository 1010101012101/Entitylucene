What arguments are available for the mobileiron URI scheme on iOS? <body> This concerns the MobileIron MyPhone@Work Client, I noticed a codemobileiron:///code URI scheme is available on iOS.  I was thinking of using this with a webclip, that directs a user to the right server for registering on the MDM server. (now I'm getting ahead of myself)  Now I'm curious what arguments are available.  <answer63181> The scheme is an open one. Apps register with iOS when they get installed, and if there is no app to take an arbitrary://link then it will just fail or go to mobile Safari.  I believe Apple maintains a list of helper prefixes, but doesn't publish it.  <answer277977> In fact, the outcome if more than one app on the device tries to register the same URL schema is undefined.  Excerpt from here:     Note: If more than one third-party app registers to handle the same   URL scheme, there is currently no process for determining which app   will be given that scheme.   <comment72139> I believe this question is a bit too localized for this site. <comment72144> "Ask Different" is a terrible title for this site then. <comment72145> Maybe MobileIron has some support channels or a community where such questions would be better suited? <comment72152> Sure, right before asking my question here, I opened a ticket with them. <comment72153> The URI scheme isn't mentioned in their knowledge base or guides, so I figured I might post it here, as this site has questions on MDM as well.
