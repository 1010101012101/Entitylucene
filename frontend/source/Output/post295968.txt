Is there any country where Apple's Map app is considered the best among all map apps? <body> In "the best", I define it as:  ul liApple's Map has the highest share/largest number of users among map apps in the country (e.g. by survey, published data by research institute, etc)/li liApple's Map has the largest number of positive answers to the question like "Which map app do you like the most?" in the country (also by survey by research institute, etc)/li /ul  I can come up with some countries that Apple's Map might be better than Google Maps, but in these countries some map apps offered by local companies are far better than Apple's (e.g. Baidu and Gaode in China).  So I feel there is no use to use Apple's Map app. Is there any such country?
