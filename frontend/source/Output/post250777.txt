How to Install OSX back in Macbook Air? <body> I have Macbook Air 2013-mid which has only Ubuntu 16.04 and reFind bootloader. Now, however, I Would like get OSX back to the whole disk. I find only updates of specific OS Xs here but not whole ISO file, which you can boot for the install. I have had licences of El Capitan on my Apple store but cannot login now to any Apple store.   I started the Internet recovery mode. It asks me wifi password. I gave it but it stays now in the mode where the Earth and you can still change the network settings. I have also Ethernet connection with USB connector to the device but it does not want to use it.  Eventually, it gives the warning sign and the text  precodeapple.com/support -2002F /code/pre  Hardware: Macbook Air 2013-midbr OS: Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit only at the moment      <comment311532> I think Internet Recovery is the way to go; Cmd/opt/R at boot. That will install the OS that the machine was shipped with, then you can update. <comment311537> @Tetsujin I started the recovery mode. It asks me wifi password.

If you still can't connect, then you need a friend with a Mac who can get the El Cap installer & make a USB boot, or take it to your nearest Apple Store; they'll set it up for you. <comment311542> @Tetsujin Please, see the body. I will next make El Cap installation with USB boot with another mac. Is there any specific which I need to consider? <comment311543> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7152/how-do-i-make-a-bootable-usb-flash-drive-a-mac
