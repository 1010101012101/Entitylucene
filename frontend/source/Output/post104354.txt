Launch quicklook from the command line in full screen mode <body> Is it possible to launch quicklook from the command line in full screen? codeqlmanage/code does not seem to have any option for that.  <answer104441> This is probably not what you meant, but you could reveal the file in Finder and emulate pressing option-space:  codeopen -R .; osascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to keystroke space using option down' -e 'tell app "Finder" to close window 1'/code  <comment122949> Yes, that works but is really not ideal. Not only because it opens and closes a window, but also because I have that specific shortcut remapped.
