how transfer videos from within an App to the mac? <body> I would like to know, if their is a way to transfer videos from Coursera-App on the ipad to the mac (without re-download them from the internet)?  I tried to connect the ipad through iTunes, to see if i can get the content of the app, but it seemed that I cannot get to the media inside the apps.  <answer229966> You can use an app such as iExplorer to copy the files over USB from the app's container.br iTunes File Sharing only works if the app in question supports this.
