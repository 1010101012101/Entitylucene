UE Boom 2 stutters with MacBook Pro when using browser <body> My UE Boom 2 stutters when using it with a web browser on my MacBook Pro with macOS Sierra. I can play Spotify fine if I just have it up front but if I push it to the background and try to browse the web, it starts stuttering. I can't play anything from the web either since it stutters from the start. My iPhone plays on the bluetooth speaker just fine but it's my MacBook that's having the problem. Has anyone else had this issue?  <comment359078> Happened to me. Drove me nuts. Had to buy a new Bluetooth adapter. Which probably isn't a desirable solution on a laptop. :( <comment359226> I'd suggest you using a different browser for testing. If it doesn't happen, you can confirm is the browser and you can maybe reset/reinstall it. Another thing you could try is creating a new user account and see if you can still replicate the issue. Basically, you need to troubleshoot and test.
