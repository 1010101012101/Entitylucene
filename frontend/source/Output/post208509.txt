What is this error when I try AirDrop to my iPhone from my MacBook Pro with El Capitan installed? <body> So, after updating to El Capitan Handoff and AirDrop stopped working.   After digging around, I found out that during AirDrop this error is logged twice in console:  precodeSDBonjourBrowser::failedToStartAdvertisingWithError Error Domain=NSMachErrorDomain Code=8 "(os/kern) no access" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=wirelessproxd can't start advertising at this time.} /code/pre  What is this and how do I resolve it? I've tried restarting sharingd and wirelessproxd, it didn't work.
