Show package contents from command line <body> When working at the terminal, I often use the codeopen ./code command to open a finder window showing the current working directory. But if the current directory is actually a package, like a code.app/code application or a code.vmwarevm/code virtual machine, codeopen ./code launches the application or the virtual machine instead.  How can I open a finder window showing the contents of a specified package?  I’ve tried codeopen -A /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app ./code, but that didn’t work.  <answer103355> You can simply codecd/code into the package to open it in Terminal, then codeopen Contents/code to open the contents in Finder.  For example, to open the contents of Safari.app in Finder, you can run the following:  precodecd /Applications/Safari.app open Contents /code/pre  <answer103356> precodeopen -R * /code/pre  opens the package in Finder. But beware: it also selects every contained file and folder. In general this might be OK for you as most of the times it's just codeContents/code.  Looks like this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwfNq.png" alt="Schalalalalala"  <answer103453> Using codeopen -R/code for the first file in the bundle would work even if the bundle doesn't have a codeContents/code directory:  precodereveal() (   shopt -s nullglob   for f; do     a=("$f"/*)     [[ -d $f &amp;&amp; ${#a} != 0 ]] &amp;&amp; open -R -- "${a[0]}" || open -R -- "$f"   done ) /code/pre  It might be easier to just type codeopen -R/code and the path of some file inside the bundle though. You can bind codemenu-complete/code in code.inputrc/code to make it easier to insert the path of the first file.  <comment121645> Not at a Mac to test, but have you tried simply using `cd /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app`?  If it doesn't work, I'll remove the comment. <comment121653> Nope, not all packages have a `Contents` folder—`.vmwarevm` virtual machines sure don’t. <comment121660> [Just files](http://pastebin.com/wbgVnXeA). <comment121666> Opening * seems like a very bad idea, especially without cautioning people on what it would do in the wrong directory (and how would someone that doesn't get directories even know which one they are in). Should this perhaps be a comment on [this other answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/103355/5472)? <comment121674> @bmike I guess you forgot the -R option... <comment121690> Another kind of bundle with no `Contents` folder is the `.xcodeproj` bundle. You can get an example [here](http://www.opensource.apple.com/tarballs/Chess/Chess-300.22.tar.gz). <comment121715> The *Contents* bit is just an example, performing a `cd` into the .app file is what you are looking for, regardless of the app bundles eventual contents. <comment122388> I'd wager a guess `open -a Finder .` doesn't work because when you double click on an App Bundle within Finder, it launches the app :).
