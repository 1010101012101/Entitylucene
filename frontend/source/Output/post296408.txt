Play feedback when volume is changed via touch bar <body> There is an audible 'pop' when I change volume using the slider in System Preferences. I can also hear it when volume is being unmuted using the soft button on touch bar.  I do not hear any feedback when volume is changed via touch bar.   I have tried tapping touch bar volume button and then dragging the slider, tapping volume icons around the slider, pressing and holding volume button without releasing touch bar; none of them provide any audible feedback.  This is true for both built-in speakers and 3.5mm output.  Is there a way of enabling feedback sound when volume is changed via touch bar?  <answer296426> Start by going to strongSystem Preferences  Sound  Sound Effects/strong.   Under the list of sound effects you should see two checkboxes, one labelled codePlay feedback when volume is changed/code. Check that box, and you should hear a feedback sound as the volume is changed.   Any time you touch the volume up/down button or release on the slider you will hear the feedback sound.  This sound will be different from the one in System Preferences, sounding more like a 'tick'  <comment374368> This setting is enabled (otherwise I would not hear the sound when changing the volume via System Preferences); still, releasing the slider does not produce any sound:( <comment374370> @Julian - alright, something seems to be off with your sound. Even if that switch is disabled you can hear the blips in system preferences. Could you try [resetting your NVRAM](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063) for me? Something may be cached in there about sound. Note that this may affect your display resolution and time zone (if not set automatically) <comment374371> Huh, Preferences' slider generate sound even if feedback is disabled indeed, thanks for that:) Sadly resetting NVRAM did not fix the touch bar slider issue <comment374372> So NVRAM reset didn't do anything (just confirming) <comment374375> No. And I am assuming the reset itself worked correctly (screen flashing during boot and then I could see a different (red) loading bar before login prompt. No settings in Preferences were affected as far as I can tell though <comment374376> Alright, can you try using the 3-piece volume icon?
