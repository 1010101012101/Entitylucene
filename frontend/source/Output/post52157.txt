Can I use 16 GB RAM with my MacBook Pro 7,1? <body> I just picked up 16GB of RAM for my MacBook Pro, running the newest OS X. According to the NewEgg reviews, it should work in it. However, once I boot up, it shows the Apple logo and, after a few seconds, the spinner just freezes.  If I boot into my Windows 7 partition, it lists 16GB as installed, and 15.7GB available. Why, then, is OS X not recognizing it?  I've tried each of the sticks themselves (1x8GB), and OS X still freezes. The RAM came as 2x8GB and are PC3-10600 @ 1333 MHz.  I've tried holding codeD/code as the computer boots, but it just gray screens for a while, then jumps to the Apple logo.  It seems to me that 16GB may not work, but why then does the same hardware, just Windows 7 successfully run?  <answer52162> According to Mactracker, the MacBookPro7,1 is a 13" MacBook Pro and it only supports 8 GB of RAM. (For machines that support 16 GB, it mentions that Apple says it supports 8GB but it'll actually work with 16.)  So OS X probably just doesn't know how to talk to 8 GB sticks on that chipset. My recommendation would be to return the RAM and get 2x4 GB.  <answer75679>    Your Mac needs to meet specific criteria for this to work. In the case of the 2010 Macs, here’s what you must have:      ul   lia Mac mini (Mid-2010), a MacBook (Mid-2010) or a 13” MacBook Pro (Mid-2010)/li   liMac OS X 10.7.5 or later/li   lithe latest EFI firmware update for your system/li   lithe proper specification memory modules/li   /ul   See Certain 2010 MacBook, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini models join the ’16GB’ MaxRAM club for details.  You will need (2x8GB) 16GB DDR3-1066MHz SODIMM. Anything faster like a DDR3-1333MHz or DDR3-1600MHHz SODIMM will fail to boot the machine.  <comment59682> @geoffc: It's a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo. It's the provided one at my new job, and eclipse is tearing up the 4GB it has in it atm. My personal one has 2x4GB, but I apparently didn't do enough research before assuming that all OSX supported 16gb. I still don't understand why Win7 reports it as there though. <comment59688> I figured as much, after more heavily researching it. Any thoughts as to why Win7 can see it? Is it perhaps just a Firmware issues? <comment59689> Windows 7 has better support than OS X for that chipset? Apple usually doesn't bother supporting what they decide they don't want to, and that appears to be something they decided they didn't want to support. <comment99113> Or, if you're a cheapskate like me, you can [mess with the EEPROM on a 1333MHz stick](http://blog.nu42.com/2013/02/mid-2010-macbook-pro-71-with-16-gb-ddr3.html). It worked for my Mid-2010 13 inch MacBookPro 7,1, but don't try it if you are nervous about that kind of tinkering.
