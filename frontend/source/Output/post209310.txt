Disable pinned tabs being in every window in Safari 9 <body> Is there any way to disable pinned tabs showing up in every Safari window? I typically have several Spaces going and the pinned tabs are only relevant to those spaces or even just to the specific Safari window.  <answer209311> No, that's the purpose of pinned tabs. If you don't wish to have the tabs shown in all windows but still want easy access, bookmark many tabs with shift-command-D and you can open them with a single click.  <comment252468> I'm unconvinced that that's the whole point of pinned tabs. Pinned tabs work the way I desire in Chrome and Firefox. I use pinned tabs so that they take up less space in the window and are always available in the same spot. I don't need access to them in every window. Obviously, Apple has different ideas than other browser vendors regarding how pinned tabs should behave. I just want to know if there's a way to get them to work like they do in basically all other browsers. <comment287406> I agree with you @donut. This is Apple's "unique take" on pinned tabs.  IMHO, it's not useful but, of course, it may be for others. I'm just hoping for the life of me that the duplicate pinned tabs don't eat up more memory.  I often have 10+ windows :-( <comment287738> @AshleyAitken It doesn't seem like they eat up more memory. If you have two windows with the same pin tab open, you'll see that the one that isn't focused goes white. <comment287759> Thanks @donut - that's interesting and I think you are right. I hadn't noticed because currently Chrome is by default browser. <comment316043> Given how poor multi display and windowing support is on OS X, no surprise they have an unique opinion with pinned tabs. This is just annoying. Why did they had to break cmd+n as well?
