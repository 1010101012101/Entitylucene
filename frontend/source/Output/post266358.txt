Audio output device not detected until replugged <body> For a few months I have been facing a problem with my audio jack (3.5mm jack) on my Mac Mini late 2014 version - every time I reboot my computer, log out and log back in or turn off one of my monitors, my audio output device stops being detected until I replug it. Is anyone else facing such an issue, and if so - what steps can I  take to fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4OL9.png" alt="enter image description here"  I am currently using Mac OS X El Capitan.  <comment333983> Does your audio output device use the standard 3.5mm analog signal, or do you use the optical connection? Please edit your question to clarify. <comment333984> @Ic I have updated the question - it uses a standard 3.5mm jack. <comment334176> This might possibly be caused by the plug being detected as a fiberoptic cable rather than a standard 3.5mm. Have you tried cleaning out the port on your Mac? When this happens, could you post a screenshot of Audio MIDI Setup with the output device selected?
