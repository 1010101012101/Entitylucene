Fonts on my iMac randomly become blurry (badly anti-aliased) until restart <body> I have a late-2009 iMac with Yosemite 10.10.2.  Recently, I've noticed that some system fonts randomly become blurry, as though there's a problem with the anti-aliasing. This affects:  ul liThe OS X Menu bar/li liThe right-click context menu/li liThe side-bar in the Finder window/li liEtc./li /ul  In this screenshot - you can see how the text in my browser window looks sharp, but the right-click context menu items are blurry:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/01nMK.png" alt="Blurry fonts in the right-click context menu"  They are not blurry when I restart. At some point, usually with in a few hours, and not after any specific, repeatable event - they become blurry. (I've never noticed strongemexactly/em/strong when it happens. All of a sudden, when I stop focusing on my work, I notice that they're blurry.  If I restart the Mac, they become sharp again, but only temporarily.  I've never played around with any settings that might have caused this change (e.g, I haven't changed LCD font smoothing or anything). And I haven't replaced the graphics card. In short - I haven't changed anything that I'm aware of.  Thanks in advance for any advice or insight!  <answer174474> Perhaps you should change your font smoothing strength  and contrast settings. Many other people are having the same problem. Check out this link for information on how to do this
