How can I let my mac memorize window layouts after switching monitors <body> Here's my scenario:  I'm a software developer with a mid 2015 MacBook Pro. I have a Dell Ultra Wide display (21:9) I use in my office. On the big monitor, I usually have 6 windows open at once, arranged in a grid using 3rd party software.  I currently use Divvy (https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/33950/divvy) to arrange my windows side-by-side in three columns. What bothers me is that after unplugging the monitor, working without the monitor (where I just use one or two windows) and going back to the bigger monitor, my window layout it messed up and I need to reorganize everything again.   I there a way, other than Divvy, where you can organize your windows and restore your grid layout? Something like monitor profiles?
