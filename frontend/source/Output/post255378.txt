How to re-activate my Command Shift 4 (for screen captures) <body> I need to re-activate my kbdCommand/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbd4/kbd (for screen captures). I somehow lost this ability on my MacBook Air.  How can I do it?  <answer255380> Open System preferences App then go to Keyboard - Abbreviations - In the left panel click Snapshots  "scissor icon" - Activate abbreviations.  and also...  Open System preferences App then go to Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts - In the left panel click screen shots - select options on right frame.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6v7E8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer255381> If the problem is with keyboard shortcuts, then open System Preferences - Keyboard - Screenshots - Shortcuts.  Then select "Screen Shots" from the pane on the left and press kbdRestore Defaults/kbd button on the screen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sKFG.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  If the problem is not in the keyboard settings, execute this from the Terminal (no need for codesudo/code):  precodekillall SystemUIServer /code/pre  And check the result.  You might also check the destination path for the saved screenshots:  precodedefaults read com.apple.screencapture /code/pre  If it points to a non-existing path, or if you want to change it, execute:  precodedefaults write com.apple.screencapture location ~/Pictures/ killall SystemUIServer /code/pre  <comment318048> Right on, seems we both did the same at the same time. Cheers :) Lets edit each others for fun.
