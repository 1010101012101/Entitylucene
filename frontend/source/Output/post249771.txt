Mount Shared Folder to desktop at log in <body> I'm trying to set up an OS X server/network with Open Directory enabled that will contain 25 iMacs and a Mac server. The network will have 200ish users split between several user groups.  I would like each of the user groups to have a shared folder on the server. I've created a test batch of network user and user groups. But is there a way to mount the specific shared folder to desktop depending on what user groups the user is assigned to?
