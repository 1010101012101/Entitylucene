Open Terminal via Finder (hitting F4?) <body> On Linux file manager, I think Dolphin (not sure right now, sorry) I can open Konsole just hitting F4. I would like to have the same on MacOS/Finder, openning Terminal instead. Is it possible?  I'm on El Captain.  <answer259107> I use Go2Shell for that purpose. It's a free app which can be added to Finder. Clicking on it will open a new Terminal window with the current directory.  You can get it on the Mac App Store.  <answer259114> Another great tool is cdto by Jay Tuley.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZM5Ls.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer259115> You could do it with a Service [a Service is just the best/simplest way to launch an app via key command, saves having to define plists etc]  If you emjust/em need to launch a default Terminal, very simply...  ul liLaunch Automator [Applications/Utilities]/li liSelect New Service/li liIn the Actions list on the left, Select Automator, then Run Applescript from the 2nd column./li liCopy/paste codetell application "Terminal" to activate/codebr embetween the on run &amp; end run commands./em/li liSave [It will automatically save to the correct place for Services./li liOpen System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services.

I'll add it as an answer if that will do you. <comment324050> "Automator service containing an Applescript , triggered from standard key commands" seems interestingly. I would like to know more. <comment324065> See also http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11323/how-can-i-open-a-terminal-window-directly-from-my-current-finder-location.
