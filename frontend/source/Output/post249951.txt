How to find out why finder hangs when "as List" / "as Columns" / "as Cover Flow" on Yosemite <body> After a while, codeView/code - codeas List/code and codeView/code - codeas Columns/code and codeView/code - codeas Cover Flow/code stop working: the Finder window will not update at all, or - for the codeCover Flow/code the "selection" part will not show a selection but the codeCover Flow/code itself will follow selection changes.  A temporary workaround is the solution at Finder doesn&#39;t work since Yosemite  But after a while, the issue starts to appear again.  Obviously something is interfering with Finder, but I've no idea where and how to get started, so:  emHow can I narrow this down to a cause?/em  I run a late 2013 Retina MacBook Pro with Yosemite (10.9.5) and a truckload of stuff including:  ul liSwitchResX (I've disabled the extensions: no change in behaviour)/li liDropBox/li liGoogle Drive/li librew/li ligfxCardStatus/li liTunnelBlick/li /ul  <answer256823> The problem is/was Google Drive. As of early October they silently released a new version 1.32 that might have solved the problem but since that one hasn't reached my system yet I will get back to it later.  Version 1.31 intermittently fails only on Mac OS X Mavericks (10.9.5) but disabling the visual notifications solves it; upgrading to a newer version also solves the problem.
