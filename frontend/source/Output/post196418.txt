Empty .MOV file, stuck on iPhone <body> After using Image Capture to copy all my photos and movies from my iPhone to my Mac, and deleting from the iPhone, I find I have one stubborn remaining file listed in Image Capture. It has a usual name, codeIMG_0155.MOV/code, but the size shows as 0.   There is indeed such a movie copied to my Mac, with a normal size of 93 MB. The movie plays normally in Preview.app on the Mac.   I cannot select the file in Image Capture, so I cannot click the emDelete/em button (red circle with slash).  Is there some way to get rid of this glitchy ghost file?  <answer196441> If the device is jailbroken, you can manually delete the file from code/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/*APPLE//code.  <answer200181> I ran into the same mysterious problem. Easiest answer I have found that worked for me: simply delete the offending empty .mov file(s) directly from your iPhone's Photos app (select and trash). They will then magically disappear from Image Capture and Photos on your Mac.  <comment234656> It'd be in the DCIM folder, right? Couldn't you just open the phone and go to that folder with Finder then find the video and delete it manually?
