Is there a way to hide, stack or collapse menubar icons? <body> Right now I have far too many icons on my menubar. I know I can command drag them off of there. But I do need to use them on occasion. Is there any app that will combine menubar items into one such that I can click to drop down if I need to use any of those?  One example is my address book - gmail address book sync. I don't actually need it in my menubar (it syncs periodically on its own). But when I remove it from the menubar, it stops syncing.   I'd even be happy with an app/script/tool that would leave it there but just hide it from me.  <answer39760> Sorry, the answer is unfortunately, no there is not.  Menulets come and go under normal working conditions, some are there 100% of the time and some only show when they are running.  But I've looked in the past and again today, I cannot see any Menu Bar customisation that works on the menulets.  <answer51289> h1Mac Bartender/h1  I've been struggling with this problem for quite some time as well and I think I've finally found a good solution.  I'm using Mac Bartender which is in free beta at the time of writing. The app has a lot of useful features for cleaning up an overflowing menubar.  For each menubar icon you can choose to:  ul liDisplay it normally/li liCompletely hide it/li liDisplay it in the menubar when Mac Bartender is activated/li liDisplay it in the Bartender Bar when Mac Bartender is activated/li /ul  One thing to note is that it doesn't let you manage the built-in OSX 'menulets' (wifi, sound, spotlight, etc) yet, but that feature is coming according to their FAQ.   h2Messy Menubar/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLFeg.jpg" alt="Messy Menubar"  h2Clean Menubar/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qy98c.jpg" alt="Clean Menubar"  h2Bartender Bar/h2  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1CKz.jpg" alt="Bartender Bar"  h1From the official site/h1     h2Take control of your Menu Bar/h2      With Bartender you can choose which apps stay in the Menu Bar, are   displayed in Bartenders Bar or Hidden completely.      h2Bartenders Bar/h2      Can be displayed and hidden as you want, by clicking on the Bartender   Icon or via a hot key.      h2Minimalism/h2      If you want a really clean look and privacy, Bartender can also be   hidden.      h2Menu Bar Apps still work the same/h2      Apps still work the same when they are in Bartenders Bar allowing you   quick access to them when needed, but keep them out of sight when not.      h2Bartenders Bar can be placed where you want/h2      Bartenders Bar can be moved at any time to any horizontal position   immediately under the Menu Bar.
