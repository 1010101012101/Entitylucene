Safari Auto Fill problem <body> At some point I misspelled my name when I typed in my email address to one of the those log in boxes.  Now the misspelling always comes up and fills in and I have to delete it and start over.   I have tried clearing history and cookies and the auto fill feature but it still happens.  How can I clear this and why will it not use my correct one after I type it in.  <answer66939> You can edit all of your emAutoFill/em information under strongSafari / Preferences / AutoFill/strong.   As your issue is with your contact information, you can, even, change it directly from strongyour/strong card in the strongAddress Book/strong application, as there is where it gets this information from.  <comment259556> I have similar issue and editing AutoFill and Passwords in Safari did not solve the problem. I have also trawled my Contacts folder and my Outlook for Mac address book and my contact is not there, so the erroneous email address is hiding somewhere. FYI, when I went to post this message as a guest and I was asked for my email address, the erroneous one was offered in some form of autofill!!
