How can I ignore DS_Store settings for a given drive? <body> I regularly use a network drive (using SMB), along with a bunch of other Mac users. Because those other Macs leave the window view settings in .DS_Store files, I'm constantly having my windows open using other people's last-view settings. Is there any way I can somehow tell the Finder to ignore .DS_Store settings for a given volume?  (I know there's a way I can stop emmy/em system from leaving .DS_Store files, but setting that same preference on every Mac that might access the volume is not an option.)  <answer102394> Other than using the terminal command   precodesudo find /&lt;volume&gt; -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \; /code/pre  and running it with cron on a regular schedule, you could use FolderWasher, and clean up the volume whenever you wish.  http://sw.ixoft.com/folderwasher/
