How do I find the path of a file on another computer on my network? <body> I would like to access files from another computer on the same network in the Terminal. But I am not sure of the path to those files. How do I find it?  <answer191021> It would depend on how you want to access the file. Here's what I do:  ol liInitiate the connection to the remote computer (I do it via Finder - Go - Connect to Server [or Command+K]) but you can also do via terminal using the codemount/code command/li liConnect to the shared folder/volume available to your user/li liWhen connecting to those in Terminal, you would now use the path code/Volumes/[name of folder]/[rest_of_path_here]/code to access them./li /ol  For example, if you connected to a folder called Stuff with a subfolder called Things, and ultimately file jackpot.txt on ip 10.10.1.5, first connect via smb to the server (10.10.1.5), choose the folder Stuff, and then reference that path in Terminal as /Volumes/Stuff/Things/jackpot.txt  EDIT: You can also run a Find command (Command + F) inside of Finder while you are connected to the share if you still don't know where the file is. Do the following:  ol liOpen Finder, connect to the server/volume (Steps 1+2 above)/li liRun Command+F to Find, enter your search term/li liAbove the Finder section where files display, switch the search to "Shared" - this will run the search against connected volumes/li liLocate the file you want, and then drag+drop it into an open Terminal window/li liThe path will be shown in Terminal/li /ol  <answer191026> In addition to drag and drop, you can right click on any Finder window, select "Customize Toolbar," and add the "Path" drop-down button.   It won't show a path you can copy-paste like in Windows, but it will give a better idea of the path to a folder you're in.   <comment226848> Thanks. Dragging the file to terminal is as easy as it gets. <comment226849> @gdaniel Very true :) Figured I'd help also fill in the cracks in case the file was just completely unknown in its location!
