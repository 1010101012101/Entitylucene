How to check if invisible items are visible? <body> How do I check in AppleScript, if invisible objects are visible? If visible, do: codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0/code in invisible, do: codedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1/code.  That should be one script, so I can change the visible with one click. Is that possible with AppleScript?  <answer179878> This sets the value of b to true or false depending on the current value of AppleShowAllFiles:  precode[[ $(defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles) = 1 ]] &amp;&amp; b=false || b=true /code/pre  Therefore, you can create a script such as this:   precodedo shell script "[[ $(defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles) = 1 ]] &amp;&amp; b=false || b=true defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool $b" tell application "Finder"     quit     delay 0.2 -- without this delay there was a "connection is invalid" error     reopen -- open a new default window     activate -- make Finder frontmost end tell /code/pre   All credit to Lauri in this answer on Stack Overflow  <answer179879> An alternative to grgarside's script, this doesn't need you to restart the Finder, just refresh open windows.  Can be saved as an app or in Automator, as a Service.br I have it as a Service, triggered on kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd  kbd H /kbd from System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services - which required me to change the 'Hide Finder' key command in …Shortcuts  App Shortcuts to something other than default.  To add as Service, launch Automator then File menu  New.br Select Service in the dialog then drag Run Applescript to the new Automator window.br Copy/paste the script inside the codeon run/code - replacing (* Your script goes here *) &amp; Save. It needs only the default parameters for everything else.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uggkY.png" alt="enter image description here"  In System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services it will be added as the last line. Set any trigger key command you like.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H712a.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you use kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd H /kbd the same as me, you'll need to change Hide Finder to something else - I just used a garbage shortcut as I never need that command…  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nF3CU.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState   tell application "Finder"     set theWindows to every Finder window     repeat with i from 1 to number of items in theWindows         set this_item to item i of theWindows         set theView to current view of this_item         if theView is list view then             set current view of this_item to icon view         else             set current view of this_item to list view          end if         set current view of this_item to theView     end repeat end tell /code/pre  The script itself reads the current state of the invisible flag (less elegantly than grgarside's version but just as effectively;) then toggles each open window to another view type - list, icon etc then back again.  strongEdit:/strong Just refreshing the windows no longer works in El Capitan, you now have to restart the Finder.br New version for El Capitan  precodeset newHiddenVisiblesState to "YES" try     set oldHiddenVisiblesState to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"     if oldHiddenVisiblesState is in {"1", "YES"} then         set newHiddenVisiblesState to "NO"     end if end try do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles " &amp; newHiddenVisiblesState &amp; "; killall Finder" /code/pre  <comment213434> Thanks! It works. But can you explain, what the script is doing, the near background of the mode of operation? And how can I add a service with a shortcut? <comment213438> I tweaked the answer... <comment213455> And what does the scrip does here? For what is the "-bool $b" and the "[[ $(defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles) = 1 ]]"
