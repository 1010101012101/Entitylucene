Is there a way to capture popovers in macOS? <body> I want to capture popovers in macOS, to use them in my blog.  But I couldn't find a good way to do it: whenever I try to capture them as windows (CMD+Shift+4, then spacebar), the area will include the windows they attach to. Is there a better way to capture the popovers (clean, but including their shadows)?  <answer262875> Found the solution by accident: after the camera icon appears, press and hold âŒ˜ key, then click the popover or sheet.
