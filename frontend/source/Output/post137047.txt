Don't want iBooks to always paste the "Excerpt From" of what I have copied <body> I read on iBooks, and some other resources and gather my notes in EverNote. When I copy a text from iBooks to keep it as a note in some other external application like EverNote, it keeps pasting the source info which is so annoying and I have to keep deleting them after every copy-paste. For example:  precode“To bind this class using Ninject, I specify the value of the constructor parameter using the WithConstructorArgument method in the AddBindings method, as shown in Listing 6-20.”  Excerpt From: Adam Freeman. “Pro ASP.NET MVC 5.” iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=4CB3769B56E7D2A905C0332D53D7E31D /code/pre  <answer197432> Here is an example of using Automator script on how to do it with a keyboard shortcut.   You want to do put this in a script:  precode# strip out iBooks citation sed -E -e 's/^[ ]?[0-9]* //g' | sed -E -e 's/“[ ]?[0-9]?[ ]?//g' | sed -E -e 's/”$//g'  | sed -E -e 's/^(Excerpt From).*//g' /code/pre  <answer246233> You could use Keyboard Maestro to trigger the following AppleScript:  precodeset original_clipboard to the clipboard set paragraph_count to count of paragraphs of original_clipboard -- assuming the last two paragraphs are what you want to strip out-- -- that is, the blank line and the attribution set new_clipboard to paragraphs 1 thru -2 of original_clipboard as string set the clipboard to new_clipboard -- now you can paste /code/pre  With Keyboard Maestro you would make a new macro, triggered by some keystroke (maybe Command-Option-V), and the first step would be an "Execute an AppleScript" (in the Execute section) using the above script. The next step would be a "Paste" (in the Clipboard section). You would copy your text, then click where you want to paste it, then press Command-Option-V to have it pasted in without the last two paragraphs.  Other macro programs would work too as long as they know how to execute an AppleScript.  <answer271681> I have created a script for ClipMenu (macOS clipboard utility) to strip unwanted information:  precodereturn clipText.replace(/^“/, '').replace(/”\s*Excerpt.*iBooks\.\s?$/, ''); /code/pre  Save as code/Users/USERNAME/Library/Application Support/ClipMenu/script/action/iBooks.js/code  <answer293268> Below are steps for copying text from iBooks:  ol liHighlight the passages you wish to copy./li liA popup will be opened automatically strongor/strong you must open a popup using a right click on selected passages./li liSelect the 'Add Note' option from the popup./li liThe selected/highlighted text will be shown on the left pane./li liRight click on the passages in the left panel and select the 'Copy' option./li /ol  I have created a video to show how it works: https://youtu.be/ZQLl_Gl9TMw  Happy coding!  <comment162761> You can't avoid this. Apple programmed it that way due to legal and copyright. So bad news for  you need to get used to it. :-( <comment162774> may you can build a Automator Script - but I'm not sure if you can edit Text Copy+Paste Process ... <comment334607> That's really annoying when you actually have the right to copy phrases **:'(** <comment344622> Came here because pasting from the Swift book examples sucks. One more reason to get literature from iBooks but all programming books on Kindle. <comment348127> @konqui They know we can delete that right. It is not very clever. It is an annoying boilerplate for a basic task. <comment369994> Welcome to Ask Different!
