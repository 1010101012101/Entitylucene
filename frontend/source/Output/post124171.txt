What are all the languages supported by Siri as of Apple iOS 7.1? Is there a changelog available? <body> I was able to find this information from the official support documentation for Siri: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4992     Siri understands and can speak the following languages:      ul   liUnited States (English, Spanish)/li   liUnited Kingdom (English)/li   liAustralia (English)/li   liFrance (French)/li   liGermany (German)/li   liJapan (Japanese)/li   liCanada (Canadian French, English)/li   liChina (Mandarin)/li   liHong Kong (Cantonese)/li   liItaly (Italian)/li   liKorea (Korean)/li   liMexico (Spanish)/li   liSpain (Spanish)/li   liSwitzerland (French, German, Italian)/li   liTaiwan (Mandarin)/li   /ul   But I don't think it has been updated as of iOS 7.1 (the page shows Last Modified: Sep 18, 2013). So...  ul liWhat are all the languages that Siri supports as of iOS 7.1?/li liIs there an changelog available showing languages added in each version right from the beginning?/li /ul  <answer124191> There is a change log available, you can find it here. This is what it says about siri:  strongSiri/strongbr  ul liManually control when Siri listens by holding down the home button while you speak and releasing it when you're done as an alternative to letting Siri automatically notice when you stop talking/li liNew, more natural sounding male and female voices for Mandarin Chinese, UK English, Australian English, and Japanese/li /ul  And the change log you mentioned isn't updated because there was no need for it, I verified on my iPhone running iOS 7.1 and there are no new languages in addition to the list you posted.  On the developer portal there is another change log (here) that shows all changes in different versions. It is a lot more technical than the "consumer log".  <comment145124> For languages evolution see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri#Supported_languages <comment145144> Hello Dennis, in the question, I didn't ask about what's new in iOS 7.1. I asked, "Is there an changelog available **showing languages added in each version right from the beginning?**" <comment145146> there isn't a log like that, you could check the developer portal here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008246 but This is only information related to the technical changes in different versions <comment145150> That's it! **1.** You answered my first question with, *"I verified on my iPhone running iOS 7.1 and there are no new languages in addition to the list you posted."*. **2.** [The link](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008246) you posted in the comment has links to all major versions of iOS after 4.0 (and Siri became available only in iOS 5). So, please modify your answer to include this info, and I'll be happy to tick it off. Thank you very much! <comment145155> I changed it, you're welcome :)
