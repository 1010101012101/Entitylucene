How to approve "Unapproved caller" whilst installing the software? <body> I'm trying to install FUSE for OS X, but it fails with the message:     Unapproved caller.      SecurityAgent may only be invoked by Apple   software.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIxi4m.png" alt="Unapproved caller. SecurityAgent may only be invoked by Apple software."

My situation was different, I had trashed the content of hidden var/folders/ after seeing a post that said it was all leftover junk from earlier flash updates. Turns out Mavericks needed something and was very unhappy and determined to teach me a lesson. Would not let me use TM to recover.
