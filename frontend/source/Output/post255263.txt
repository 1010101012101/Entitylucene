How to create a clean (virtual?) Mac OS machine for software testing <body> I'd like to create a test environment for Mac OS X. I would like to be able to repeatedly start from a 'clean' Mac OS X state, then install some libraries and programs (similar to what Travis-CI is doing).  Is there a recommended way to implement such setup ? For example, purchase a Mac Mini + Parallels, then create virtual machines from the Mac OS X Recovery partition - would that work?  Thanks!  <comment317881> Do you currently have a Mac and if so what model?  If yes, please be explicit so I can look up the specs. <comment317899> Parallels would be my go-to solution. If you've the disk space, you can just keep duplicating the clean OS at any stage, mess up the copy, dupe again... keep what you've room for or need to look at again.
