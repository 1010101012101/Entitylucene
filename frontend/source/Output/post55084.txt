What format does Apple Mail store its emails in? <body> We're trying to convert a user's email mailbox from Apple Mail to Outlook 2010.    We copied the files off the mac, and they are mostly directories that end in code.mbox/code and contain a folder called codeMessages/code containing code.emlx/code files.  The code.mbox/code extension on the folders initially made me think that these messages were in the mbox format, but after some research I found that the mbox format is actually a single file, so that rules out it being in that format.  <answer55086> There was a question on Stack Overflow where the answer linked to a program to convert to mbox format.  It appears to be proprietary and therefore not well documented in the public domain.  <answer55091> You can find a description of the format based on an reengineering effort here:     It has three parts:      ol   liThe length of part 2, in bytes/li   liThe message itself/li   liMessage metadata (XML Property List)/li   /ol   <answer121166> The vengefulcow site's code is nice, but needs a slight modification if you're messing with newer OSX mail.app versions and imap mailboxes, here's a unified diff:  precode$ diff -u emlx2mbox/emlx2mbox.rb emlx2mbox-works/emlx2mbox.rb --- emlx2mbox/emlx2mbox.rb      2006-12-13 12:02:41.000000000 -0500 +++ emlx2mbox-works/emlx2mbox.rb        2014-02-16 01:28:38.775293976 -0500 @@ -56,7 +56,7 @@      # Compile messages in mbox directories.      mbox_dirs = Dir.entries(source_dir).find_all do |entry|        File.directory?("#{source_dir}/#{entry}") and -      (entry[-5..-1] == ".mbox") +      (entry[-9..-1] == ".imapmbox")      end #find_all      mbox_dirs.each do |dir|        if File.directory?("#{source_dir}/#{dir}/Messages") @@ -68,7 +68,7 @@      subdirs = Dir.entries(source_dir).find_all do |entry|        File.directory?("#{source_dir}/#{entry}") and        entry[0, 1] != "." and -      entry[-5..-1] != ".mbox" +      entry[-9..-1] != ".imapmbox"      end #do      subdirs.each do |dir|        self.convert_mailboxes("#{source_dir}/#{dir}", "#{dest_dir}/#{dir}") /code/pre  <comment63218> But the format doesn't have a name? <comment63270> Well I think it's just called EMLX
