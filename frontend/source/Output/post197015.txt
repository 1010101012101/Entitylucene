How to not import duplicates from shared Photos album <body> When I import photos from a shared library, either from my own Family album or one shared with other iOS users, they are imported as expected. I cannot reimport them again.  However, if you share a picture in a shared album yourself (e.g. originating from the Photos.app on on my Mac), you strongcan import that photo/strong again once in your library. Resulting in duplicate photos.   This occurs in the Mac OSX Photos app, version 1.0.1 (215.65.0).  I'm aware that 'duplicate' in the technical definition may not be accurate; the imported photo in this case will have a different filename and be of lower resolution. But from a functional perspective it IS a duplicate.   Is there any way to avoid importing these duplicates so every now and then I can safely select and import a bunch of pictures from a shared library, without having to cleanup the duplicates afterwards?  Note that I've seen a similar older question, which is only for iPhoto.  strongUpdate 11 Jan, 2016/strong: This is still an issue with the latest version of Photos v1.3 (350.23.0)  <answer244734> MacPaw Gemini duplicate finder seems to be a good app for this job  <comment235485> good point with technical and functional ! +1 from me <comment301643> Welcome to Ask Different!
