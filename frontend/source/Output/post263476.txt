How to locate a particular place in macOS? <body> In this link, there is the unix command   precode$HOME/.matlab/&lt;version&gt;/matlab.prf. /code/pre  How to go to this place by using terminal?  <answer263484> code$HOME/code is your home directory.  This is the directory you are in when you start a terminal window.  Normal using on Mac (and most unix-like systems, is that your home directory has the same name as your short user name.  So if you are Mike Smith, and have a short user name of msmith then the value of code$HOME/code is (usually) code/Volumes/Users/msmith/code.  codeHOME/code is an strongemenvironment variable/em/strong. If I create a script or a set of directions and use code$HOME/code instead of code/Volumes/Users/msmith/code, then that script can be used by other people.  When I log in, during the startup process MY codeHOME/code variable is set to code/Volumes/Users/sherwood/code.  The &lt;  notation means, "Don't type this literally, but find out what the value is, and use that instead.  No automatic substitution this time.  In general on Mac and UNIX/Linux/*BSD systems a file in your home directory (possibly other places) that starts with a period contains settings for that software package.  So code.matlab/code is a directory of Matlab settings, startup scripts, this and that.  code&lt;version&gt;/code is replaced by the version number of your Matlab installation.  You may have several different Matlab versions.  The easiest way to find this is by typing   precodels .matlab /code/pre  In your home directory.  I don't have Matlab on my Mac, so I'm only guessing, but you will probably see something like codeR2009b/code and/or codeR2011a/code.  So if your username was codemsmith/code, you could refer to this file as   precode~/.matlab/R2011a/matlab.prf /code/pre  The code~/code is another shorthand meaning the 'home directory of'. Often you can just use code~/code by itself.  As code~/.matlab/code.  code~/.matlab/code and code$HOME/.matlab/code are two ways of saying the same thing.    If you need to GO there -- to see what else is in that directory, just chop off everything after the last code//code and put codecd/code in front.  Thus   precodecd ~/.matlab/R2011a/ /code/pre  will leave you in the folder containing codematlab.prf/code  hr  The default settings folder in newer MatLAB versions seems to be code$HOME/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/version//code though:  the path to codematlab.prf/code is then e.g.   precode"$HOME/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/R2016b/matlab.prf" /code/pre  <comment330140> See if it's clearer now. <comment330143> Yep - also mentioning $HOME being an env var is appreciated ;-). I already thought of editing it into your answer myself, but then I hesitated. I will add a proper MatLAB like version number later - I think it looks like this: *RYearRevision* +1 <comment334895> You said "_$HOME is an environment variable._" and `$HOME` **is not** a _variable_, `HOME` is the _variable_. In Terminal, if you execute `unset $HOME` it errors with `-bash: unset: /Users/name': not a valid identifier` because `$HOME` **is not** the _variable_, it' expands the _variable_. However `unset HOME` works without error. See `Shell Variables` in the BASH manual page. <comment334906> Good point @user3439894.  Fixed.
