Microsoft Word right-to-left (RTL) support <body> I have on my Mac - Microsoft Word 2010, now â€¦ I want to write from right to left ( not only text-align right, but direction ltr).  I'll be thankful for some help. :)  <answer15918> There's no right-to-left support for Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac presently. There are several alternative word processors that do support RTL, however:  ol liOpenOffice/li liMellel/li liNisus Writer Pro/li /ol  <answer130632> After endless effort to find a solution the only thing that worked for me was strongopening another document that was already saved/strong with a paragraph direction strongfrom right to left/strong. Worked like a charm!  <answer214207> Nevron Writer for MAC has RTL support though its not perfect - https://www.nevronoffice.com/  <comment17295> Thanks alot. Hmm... Do you know if they have a mail which I can advice them to add this ability? <comment17296> Yep, here you go: http://www.microsoft.com/mac/product-feedback <comment66023> This isn't exactly an answer for MS Word, but if you're cheap (like me) and just want to print a little right-to-left text, Safari and Firefox these days both support the `dir="rtl"` instruction for HTML. <comment137360> While reviewing a document, I added a comment, and the `[Comment 1:]` text appeared on the right of the box, with the text I entered appearing to the left of it. Maybe Word for Mac 2011 supports right to left text if it is specified in a file from another version. <comment153225> You mean another RTL document created with Windows Word, right?  This workaround is not totally unknown, but I think most people have found it buggy and not very useful in practice.  If it works perfectly for you, that would be welcome progress. <comment184700> @SabreWolfy I have Word 2011 and it doesn't support yet. <comment208894> Also: [Why doesn't Microsoft Office/2008(& later) support RTL languages?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/3/8546) (2010) <comment208905> I have tested Word 2016 Preview and it still has no RTL support. <comment209850> Do you want to write in english? Or in another language like arabic or hebrew? <comment209852> "Direction ltr", are you sure? It means left-to-right. Like I am writing now. <comment258587> What do you  mean by "not perfect"? <comment282216> As of right now, Office for Mac 2016 finally fully supports RTL.
