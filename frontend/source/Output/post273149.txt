Is it possible to run Xquartz in the background <body> I have installed the recent version of xquartz on OSX 10.11.6.  I would prefer to run the x-server in the background, e.g. as a daemon.  From a user point of view I do not want to codeCmd+Tab/code to the x-server but only the actual applications I use.
