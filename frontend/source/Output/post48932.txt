App store account sign in <body> When I open the App Store on my iPhone, it opens my Australian account by default. How can I change the settings so it opens my US account (which I do own legally).  <answer48954> Click to open the App Store,  sliding to the bottom of the page, you can see your AU account, click on it, select codelog out/code.Then you can log in the US account.  <answer49084> Go to 'Settings &lt; Store' op your iPhone and scroll to the bottom of the page. There you'll see your Apple ID. By tapping on it, you get some options:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjIRr.png" width="320"  If you choose to log out, you can log in with your US account and it will open the Store app by default with your US account.  <comment55999> Mine always stays logged in so I'm not sure why you're experiencing this issue. <comment56163> Thanks vanemu.   Your name sounds Dutch Australian to me !?
