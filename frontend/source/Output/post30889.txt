Do any iOS writing apps support keyboard shortcuts for bold/italics? <body> When an iPad or iPhone is connected to an Apple Bluetooth Keyboard, the Pages app does not respond to the standard keyboard shortcuts (Command-B, Command-I) for bold and italics.  There is a touch method to enable these formatting options but it is distracting and cumbersome, akin to taking one's hands off a keyboard to use a mouse.  When Apple originally released the iPad, I assumed that this simple bug in Pages would be fixed promptly, but I was wrong. Are there any alternate writing apps that support the standard keyboard shortcuts for text formatting?
