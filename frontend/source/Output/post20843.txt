Can I dual boot Snow Leopard and Lion? <body> I own a Mac Mini 3.1 with Snow Leopard installed. I would like to dual boot with Lion for development purposes.  I have partitioned my hardisk as described in Point (1) in this tutorial   How to Install Dual Boot Mac OSX Lion and Snow Leopard  Can I now buy and download Lion from the apple store and then install it on the new partition?  <answer20847> You'll need to make your own bootable DVD/USB of the Lion installer to do so. This can be made from the AppStore download and is documented well by OSXDaily.  strongLion USB Installerbr Lion DVD Installer/strong  Then hold ALT at system boot (before chime &amp; Apple logo) and select your install volume.  <answer20872> Buy and download the Lion needs the Mac AppStore.  So you need to boot with SL first, buy and download the Lion without installation.  Then follow @macaco's answer to have a clean installation.  <comment22878> or install SL on the Lion partition then boot into it and  install Lion directly from the app store on that <comment22889> @Mark That's also a viable option, however, it's best practice to do a clean install rather than an upgrade. It takes less time and is less trouble prone. <comment22890> why best practice? OSX has always emphasised upgrades <comment22900> It takes less time and is less trouble prone (in my experience). It's also the best suited method for OP. <comment22902> OSX usually upgrades relatively well and easily. Upgrades are emphasised to provide a better and more coherent user experience. But in general computing terms, best practice for a fresh install of an OS is to fresh install, not upgrade.
