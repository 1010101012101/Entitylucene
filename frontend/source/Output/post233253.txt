Changing language in Pages on a Mac? <body> I have a Mac and I'm a Spanish Student. I primarily use Pages in English, but sometimes I work in Spanish and I'd like to have spell check and not have red lines under all my words. I went to system preferences and added Spanish as a second language but that didn't seem to work. Ideas?  <answer233255> Press kbdâŒ˜ CMD/kbd+kbd:/kbd to open strongSpelling and Grammar/strong and change your language there (or go to codeEdit/code - codeSpelling and Grammar/code - codeShow Spelling and Grammar/code).   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C55NK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer233320> You also can set that specific language box, that Mateusz mentioned ( cmd + : ) to 'automatic'. This works great for me, as I write documents in German, English and Dutch at the same moment. I don't have to adjust every document then :)
