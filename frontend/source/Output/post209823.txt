mupdf command does not install with homebrew <body> I tried to install MuPDF on OS X 10.11 using Homebrew:  precodebrew install mupdf-tools /code/pre  But when I try to use it from the command line (it doesn't show up on Launchpad) I get the following error:   precodemupdf example.pdf -bash: mupdf: command not found /code/pre  Looking around a bit, I find 64-bit executables for mudraw, mujstest and mutool in /usr/local/bin. These commands seem to work. But there is no executable for mupdf there or anywhere else that I can find (using the find command). Any ideas what has gone wrong?  <answer210782> Run mupdf-x11   This works both for mupdf-tools and mupdf from homebrew since they install the same binaries  <answer269248> MalCos answer is correct. Just one addition:br MuPDF is a command line program and does not offer a graphical frontend to load files. I was missing this functionality and scripted MuPDF Droplet for it.   MuPDF Droplet is a strongGUI for MuPDF under OS X/strong to drop your PDF/whateverMuPDFsupports-Files on to the program icon and they open with MuPDF. So you don't need to know the CLI command to start MuPDF...  MuPDF Droplet was created using Platypus, the source is included in the distribution DMG. Download MuPDF Droplet, it's Open Source licensed under GPL.  <comment256779> Thanks, MalCos. What I did in the end was 'brew install mupdf' and then, at the command line, 'mupdf-x11 example.pdf'. That worked. <comment344922> mupdf-tools runs as `mutool`
