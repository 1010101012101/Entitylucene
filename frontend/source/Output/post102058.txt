Reset iPhone 3GS with broken power button and touch screen <body> I've got a broken 3GS and both the power button and touch screen are broken and there's a passcode I forgot on it. It's also no longer synced with iTunes.  So basically I want to get this thing in recovery mode but how? Can't reset it with iTunes. Can't power it off to get it in recovery mode.  How can I shut off the device (preferably with voice commands or USB) It's not jailbroken so no SSH either.  I've also got an iPod Touch (4th generation) and was wondering if I could steal the power button and/or screen from that, even if it's just to format it.  <answer102083> Here's an idea. Take a magnet, and touch the screen with it. By any luck, the magnet will the trigger the system to erase all the memory, and you can reset it up. But if it doesnt work (because its just an idea and I never tried it), go to an Apple specialist. You may wanna recycle it and probably update it to a better phone, such as the iphone 5s and 5c that is coming out, unless you're collecting old iphones. But still this is an idea and I hope it works and helps for you.  <comment120840> So you've never *tried* this. But have you even heard of an instance where this actually worked?  Where did you *get* the idea?
