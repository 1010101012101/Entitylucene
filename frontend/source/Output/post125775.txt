How do I remove the Google Chrome notifications bell icon from the Mac OS X menu bar? <body> This bell icon showed up in my menu bar one day and there's no obvious way to disable it. How do I get rid of it?  <answer127276> Google has buried this option in a very hard-to-find location.  ol liVisit strongchrome://flags/#enable-google-now/strong in Chrome.app/li liVisit strongchrome://flags/#notification-center-tray-behavior/strong in Chrome.app/li liChange both settings to strongDisabled/strong. (They're probably on Default currently.)/li /ol  (NOTE: this used to be emchrome://flags/#enable-rich-notifications/em)  <answer131488> This seems to have changed to  chrome://flags/#enable-google-now  I would make a comment instead of a new answer but I require 50 rep for that.  <answer132063> Chrome for OS X v35.0.1916.114, "Enable Rich Notifications Mac, Windows" has changed to "Notification Center behavior Mac" and is still located in chrome://flags  <answer132846> For Chrome (Version 35.0.1916.114), all you have to do is click on the bell to open the dialog box and then simply click on the bell with the line through it to toggle it on and off.  It disables the notifications, but doesn't remove the bell, so it solves part of the problem, that you said there was "no easy way to disable it".  <answer135759> It's easy. In Chrome 35.0.1916.153 m:  ol liGo to strongchrome://flags/strong in the address bar and uncheck the strongEnable Rich Notifications Windows, Chrome OS/strong and strongGoogle Now/strong/li liGoogle Updates has to be turned off (search for instructions on how to do this on OS X)/li liIn the firewall block all traffic for Google Updater/li /ol  <answer139207> edit: strongThe option described below has been removed from Chrome. This should void the question as well as my answer./strong  Old answer:  In the Chrome Menu Bar under strong"Chrome - Hide Notification Icon"/strong you can get rid of the bell without having to go through flags (which doesn't work/exist any more!). It's the Option one from the bottom (I found the information in a comment on osxdaily):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mi0Qr.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer157251> Some solutions here appear to be outdated.  Good answer is available here:  https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3220216?hl=en  <answer178295> ol liClick on the bell icon,/li liClick on the Settings tab,/li liThen uncheck "Google Now"/li /ol  <answer205106> It worked for me by simply locating the file (mine was in the download folder) and deleting it. The key is to locate the incomplete file.  <answer223473> It seems like Google Chrome after v 47.0.2526.73 no longer has the Notification center (bell).br news link  <comment154493> It's fine to provide a new answer explaining how another is outdated. Also, editing the wrong answer is best. Your call. Welcome to Ask Different! <comment160952> that path does not exist on a Mac. <comment164388> On Chrome 36, none of these options exist.  :( <comment164389> Ah, looks like in Chrome 36 there's a menu item for this!  See [SebK's answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/139207/25999). <comment166250> This is finally starting to bubble up to the top of google searches.

This works perfectly! Thanks! <comment235070> None of the chrome://flags console worked after upgrade, but your solution sill works fine so far. Great tips. <comment267696> I disabled it and now cannot enable - the hide notifications option is gone <comment267841> @DataGreed it seems that the option has been removed from the UI. I'm on Chrom V 47.0.2526.106 and the options depicted in the screenshot isn't available any longer, as you noted. Not sure there is a way to get it back. <comment269396> It's no longer there in Chrome 37.
