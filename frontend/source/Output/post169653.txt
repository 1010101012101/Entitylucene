Is iOS 8 necessary for iCloud sharing? <body> I have an iPhone 4s, and have Family Sharing turned on. From my phone, I select photos on the camera roll and send them to my iCloud, but they never show up in iCloud. Is this because I do not have iOS 8?   <comment199339> No good sir, it is not. However, Family Sharing is exclusive to iOS 8 [see details here](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/family-sharing/) how are you trying to view your photos? What are you tapping on? <comment199574> Thank you for the reply.I look at iCloud.com, to see if the photos I sent from my iPhone show up, and they do not.
