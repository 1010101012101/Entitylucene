Display time zone in photos app for mac <body> I'm trying to display the time zone that an image was taken in in the Photos app for Mac. I've seen screenshots of this being done but I can't seem to figure it out myself.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aaGjq.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  What is a way to do so?  <answer194419> If you want to see the capture time on an image, select it and press kbdâŒ˜ cmd/kbd+kbdi/kbd or go to Window  Info to see the Info Pane.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7AmRS.png" alt="Info"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FlZDS.png" alt="Info pane"  If you want to change that information, select the image you want to correct and then at the top menu select Image  Adjust Date and Time  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEKMZ.png" alt="Photos app - Image &gt; Adjust Date and Time"  This menu will appear that lets you adjust said information.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X7OCa.png" alt="Adjust Date and Time menu dropdown"  Source and more info  <comment232010> Thanks for your reply. I've seen that. But I also saw the following screen shot in a forum that clearly shows the time zone in the info box and refers to turning it on. But I can't see  http://i.stack.imgur.com/aaGjq.jpg <comment232012> @MikeW, could you post the link to the forum where you saw that also?
