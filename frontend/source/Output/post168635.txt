Xcode C++ project adds C style header formate to new files <body> I just started using XCode to do basic C++ programming. I have noticed something strange.  When Im working on a C++ project, and want to add a new C++ source file, the automatic generated file is formated as a C file, even though its extention is .cpp.  Im using Xcode 6.1.1. I was a member of the Mac OSX public beta program, but I think I use the released version of Xcode.  Can anybody reproduce this bug, or is it just my system that got this bug? If so, how could I fix it?  This is what a typical automatic created header file look like:  precode// //  testfunk.h //  Test // //  Created by Jørgen Rørvik on 16.01.15. //  Copyright (c) 2015 Jørgen Rørvik. All rights reserved. //  #ifndef __Test__testfunk__ #define __Test__testfunk__  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;  #endif /* defined(__Test__testfunk__) */ /code/pre  <answer168643> The Xcode template for C++ files does have code#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;/code. To change this you have to create a template of your own - See several Stack Overflow questions here or here  <comment197956> How does the format of a C and c++ differ? <comment197957> I would expect a C++ project to use iostream instead of stdio.h which is a C library. When I start a new project, the main.cpp includes iostream, so I think this is a bug. <comment197963> That is not formatting but creation of a new file - you need to rewrite the question to say what is the problem - also search for Xcode templates as these are what set things <comment197964> This will solve my problem, but I still think that it is a bug. Do you agree? <comment197979> Yes but I would note I gave up C++ programming in Xcode as it does not really support it e.g. try namespaces and code completion - for C and Objective C it is good
