Application crashes; 'Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion' returning 10.9.2 <body> I'm using Sublime Text 3, and I've got its icon in my dock. However, when I try to start it by clicking the icon, it immediately crashes with the following error (in Console);  precode08/04/15 16:57:11,828 Sublime Text[1397]: WARNING: The Gestalt selector gestaltSystemVersion is returning 10.9.2 instead of 10.10.2.

The documentation I find online w.r.t. this problem seems to concern a wide variety of programs, but none of it consistently. There's a discussion on the Apple discussion boards, but it holds no answers.  For my specific case, the weird thing is that I can in fact start the Sublime binary (i.e. via the Terminal). This seems to indicate that something is going wrong in the code.app/code wrapper  What could I try?  EDIT: I'm running Yosemite 10.10.2, and have upgraded from Mavericks. However, this has not been broken from the get-go, and Sublime Text 3 is the only application I'm experiencing this with.  <comment213676> Are you running Yosemite or Mavericks? <comment213677> Yosemite. I should've added that. <comment213679> Have you tried trashing sublime's preferences in your library? Does it happen in a 2nd user? Are you using a beta-build or any plugins? <comment213756> Deleting the preferences does indeed fix it. I suppose I'll have to manually migrate my preferences, then.. <comment277455> Same thing happens to me crashing iterm.
