How can I combine multiple PDFs using the command line? <body> Is there a quick one-liner to combine multiple pdfs into one?  I know it can be done using Preview.app  <answer230447> Have a look at "Combining PDF files on the command line in OSX" in Joining PDF Files in OS X From the Command Line.     It turns out that from Tiger onwards, OSX ships with a Python script   that does exactly what you need. The script is already executable, and   Python is pre-installed on OS X, so all you need to do to run it is   opening the Terminal and typing   precode"/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py" -o PATH/TO/YOUR/MERGED/FILE.pdf /PATH/TO/ORIGINAL/1.pdf /PATH/TO/ANOTHER/2.pdf /PATH/TO/A/WHOLE/DIR/*.pdf /code/pre  Also on the linked page it suggests making a symbolic link for the codejoin.py/code file to make typing easier however they omitted the code-s/code in codeln -s ... .../code, and without it, a hard link is created.  Probably wouldn't matter, however though I'd mention it.  <answer293198> Just install Ghostscript using Brew with command:  precodebrew install gs /code/pre  Then run command with all files listed:  precodegs -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=merged.pdf source1.pdf source2.pdf source3.pdf /code/pre  <comment369930> OS X/macOS already natively has a way to combine PDF files from the command line, so why waste the time of having to first install Command Line Tools for Xcode, Homebrew and then Ghostscript, to do something that can already be done natively without having to install any of the aforementioned packages?
