How to open two ports (both TCP / UDP) using pf <body> I own a MacBook pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013), running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 as host computer and VMware Fusion Pro Version 8.5.3 with Windows 10 and Linux as guests  OS's. So my question is how do I open the two ports 1338 (TCP and UDP) and 1340 (TCP and UDP) in my case using my Windows guest OS. Both ports have to reachable from the internet. The whole network is attached to a Linksys X3000 router which connects to the internet.  I have Murus lite, but I must confess that I don't know how to efficiently use it, even I can also buy the pro version anyway.  <answer269547> You have two options here: a very simple one and second one which requires a lot of work because unlike Parallels VMware Fusion doesn't provide a NAT &amp; port forwarding interface.  Neither requires Murus or pf.  ol liBridged Mode  Instead of connecting the Windows 10 VM in NAT-mode use the Bridge Mode and choose - depending on the connection of the OS X host - either the Wi-Fi or Ethernet interface. In Bridge Mode your VM acts as a separate host in your main network.   If your main network has the network address 192.168.0.0/24, the router 192.168.0.1 and your OS X host something in the range 192.168.0.2-192.168.0.254 then you have to configure the Windows VM with a static but unique IP (e.g. 192.168.0.10) in the same range. This is done in the System Preferences of the VM! All other settings (Netmask/Gateway/DNS) there are identical to the settings of the OS X host. I also recommend to set the Mac to a fixed IP (e.g. 192.168.0.2)  In the Windows 10 guest also configure the Firewall and open port 1338 and 1340 to the world.  Now connect to your Linksys X3000 router and configure port-forwarding:  ul liNavigate to the port forwarding section./li liClick the Applications &amp; Gaming link./li liClick the Single Port Forwarding button to forward ports./li liCreate two port forward entries.

You can check whether the firewall is running or not by entering codesudo pfctl -s all | grep Status/code. If it is enabled open Murus Lite and check the state of the firewall. If you see a yellow light in the upper right corner it's running with the default Apple rules (which don't block anything). If you get a green light you've enabled the packet filter with the default Murus pf settings and you either have to open the ports 1338 and 1340 for incoming traffic on your Mac's interface connected to the router (e.g. en0) or uninstall the (Murus) boot scripts (Firewall  Boot Scripts  Uninstall Boot Scripts ...) and stop pf (or reboot). Removing or uninstalling Murus (Light) is not required.  Without modifying the two config files of VMware you won't be able to "open" or "redirect" ports with Murus (Lite) to a guest VM because the VMware NAT behavior can't be controlled by pf.  <comment338522> Thanks for your reply @klanomath! My windows 10 guest Os is NAT connected not bridged. The purpose is to make the ports reachable from outside, i also installed Murus lite to forward those two ports, but was unsuccesful on that. <comment338579> @klanomath I use VMware Fusion Pro Version 8.5.3 (4696910) and I use a Linksys X3000 as router to connect to the internet. For further informations whatever they are, just ask please. Again thanks. <comment338588> I am going to test the first part of your advice tomorrow morning as it is becoming too late here, and will let you know. In the meanwhile, I must say thank you again and God bless you for all sir. <comment338791> sorry to be so late answering your post sir, because I was too busy at work! For to follow your instructions, do i need disable or deactivated pf, and if so, how? Do I also need to uninstall Murus and disable mac firewall. Thanks. <comment338964> Hi bro as you've stated, I uninstalled the (Murus) boot scripts (Firewall  Boot Scripts  Uninstall Boot Scripts, and stopped PF. Now for to continue working on the Bridged Mode first, I need some advices regarding my Osx host and VMware Wondows guest IP's addresses. For exemple if I enter ifconfig in terminal i got the following info: <comment338972> Hi bro as you've stated, I uninstalled the (Murus) boot scripts (Firewall  Boot Scripts  Uninstall Boot Scripts, and stopped PF. Now for to continue working on the Bridged Mode first, I need some advices regarding my Osx host and VMware Windows guest IP's addresses. For exemple my osx host machine has this as IP address: 192.168.1.132 and 192.168.1.255 as netmask, while my VMware windows os guest has 172.16.191.126 as IP address and 255.255.255.0 as netmask and 172.16.191.2 as default gateway. Considering all that, do I need to use fixed IP as well as the host and the gest? <comment339219> I'll install TeamViewer once I got back home, because I really need further help for to figure out all this! Thanks sir. <comment339222> Mine is GMT+0 so we have one hour of difference <comment339225> It'll be difficult for me to be at home at this time, because I am at the court right now (I am a Lawyer in life). <comment339227> At what time will you be free tomorrow? <comment339230> I misunderstood you sir!
