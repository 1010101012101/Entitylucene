How do I search for *.ai files (Adobe Illustrator) by file extension in El Capitan? <body> So I have tried doing kind:ai, and also tried doing it via the kind selector (see image below). I know how to do this using the linux "find" command already, but I really want to find a way to do this using the native finder interface.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jq0PB.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer219401> I would do this: click Spotlight in the menu bar type  .ai  in the search field.  <answer219410> OK, I finally figured it out with the following approach:  ol liOpen finder to the top-level directory you wish to search/li liPress codecommand + F/code/li liFrom the search menu options, on the left, choose codeother/code/li liClick the checkbox under the codeIn Menu/code column for codefile extension/code from the popup window and close the popup window by pressing codeOK/code/li liSelect codefile extension/code from the search menu/li liType your file extension in the text field (follows the word codeis/code)/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VheB4.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <comment265348> The limit here is only finding some .ai files. When I click on "Show all in finder" it doesn't show me only .ai files.
