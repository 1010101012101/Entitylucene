Cannot go beyond login screen <body> I was performing a routine restart this evening, and all went as per normal until I logged in with my password to my user account. The computer encountered a kernel panic towards the end of the decryption progress bar and insisted on restarting. So far, despite what I have tried, I have not been able to get beyond the login.  FileVault 2 was recently enabled on my computer.  I have tried the following, to no avail:  ul liNVRAM reset/li liSMC reset/li liApple Diagnostics (returned all OK)/li liDisk Utility First Aid/li /ul  I am yet to try the following:  ul lifsck_hfs/li licomplete wipe and reinstall/li /ul  My data has been backed up as this is the beta system.  Specs: Mid-2014 i7 MacBook Pro 11,1 MacOS Sierra Public Beta 4  <comment324446> Why are you still running an old beta!? IMO There is no good reason to still be running an old beta. I'd wipe the drive and do a clean install of macOS 10.12.1 from a USB Installer. <comment324518> @user3439894 I was going to upgrade soon, but my life got cluttered and due to circumstances upgrading wasn't possible. I'll wipe the drive and see if that works. Thanks!
