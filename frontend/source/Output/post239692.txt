How can I send focused window beneath other windows like Alt+Esc do in Windows? <body> I don't want to minimize it (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdM/kbd) or hide it (kbd⌘/kbd+kbdH/kbd). I want other windows to be on top of my focused window when I press some shortcut or fire some macro/script/whatever. How can I achieve this?  <comment294248> Same app or different app? Same app is cmd/` different app is cmd/tab <comment294251> @Tetsujin I don't want to switch to another app/window, I want to send focused window back/beneath. <comment294258> so, same app? cmd ` <comment294321> arghhh, no! I don't care what app is beneath focused window <comment294481> so... you don't want to switch windows in the same app... yet you don't want to switch to another app. That kind of leaves us out of alternatives :/
