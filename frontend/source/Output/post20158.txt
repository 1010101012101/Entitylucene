For applications that do not store Quick Look information within the file, where does Lion (or a Server) store that information? <body> Some applications can store Quick Look information (strongpreviews and thumbnails/strong) within the file. Others can not.   h1Two aspects to this question/h1  For a file that is stronglocal/strong and without integral Quick Look information:   ul liwhere does Lion store that information?/li /ul  For a file that is strongremote/strong, on an AFP server (Mac OS X Server (Leopard)/AFP 3.2+ or greater) and without integral Quick Look information:   ul lidoes Server store the information remotely?/li /ul  (An AFP client can cache emsome/em information locally, with limitations, but I strongly suspect that there must be a more permanent store.)  h2Initial guesses/h2  Much Quick Look information is stored in the attributes B-tree.   If so, an attributes B-tree in a more modern version of Mac OS X Server may be potentially better (than older versions of Server) for AFP clients where bandwidth is limited.

The inspectors know to use the previews when present, but will do the heavy lifting when needed.  The virtual memory system of course caches these files so it feels faster after the first render until it swaps out or gets disposed if the pages are not marked for a swap to disk.  <answer21570> h1com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache/h1  In combination with qlmanage, using fs_usage and fseventer drew attention to the following directory:   code/private/var/folders/*/*/C/com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache//code  Whether this is used for empreviews/em as well as emthumbnails/em, I don't know.   A Google search for com.apple.QuickLook.thumbnailcache found (amongst other things) FileVault and QuickLook leak some information from encrypted volumes (2010-07-25) with a comment,      Thumbnail cache is disabled for encrypted volumes, including file   vault users.

I'll leave this question open for a while (not indefinitely) for three reasons. First: use of virtual memory only for caching might be true if FileVault 1 **alone** is used. Second: wondering whether there'll be more to learn after iCloud is released, probably with a corresponding update to Mac OS X. Third: [Why is the HFS Plus attributes file unusually small, for only a while, after using Time Machine to restore a Lion system?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/21579/8546)
