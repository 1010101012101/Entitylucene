How can I print e-mails landscape from Outlook 2010? <body> Maybe I'm missing something but from the Print dialog in Office 2010 (OS X 10.7.3) I can't find where to set orientation?  It doesn't appear under Outlook, Layout, Color Matching, Paper Handling, Paper Feed, Cover Page or Printer Features.  <answer42327> This works in Entourage 2007 so I'm assuming that it work on Outlook 2010.  Try File  Page Setup then select Landscape. Or File  Print...  then select "Layout"  and change it Landscape.  <answer65522> ol liIn Outlook, go to File  Print  Define Styles  Edit/li liSelect 'Paper' tab/li liUnder 'Orientation' select your preference, Portrait or Landscape/li liPrint/li /ol  <answer138489> In Outlook 2011 for Mac, select page settings from the file menu. Switch it to landscape, print, and switch it back to portrait mode.  <comment48112> nope: only options under layout are pages per sheet, border, two-sided, reverse page orientation and flip horizontally <comment48113> Have you tried flip horizontally? <comment48114> yeah i tried that and it just prints a mirror image :) got it now though- see my answer above <comment48116> clearly can't read either- thanks :)
