iMovie tutorial or video? <body> Can you recommend a good site with some online training for the latest iMovie on OS X? I have tried to play with iMovie over the years and I never seem to 'get' how it is meant to be used.  Right now I have about 1.5 hours of raw video taken with my iPhone 5s of a set of student presentation and I (naively) wanted to make a short 'highlight real' of it. But once I import the video into iMovie I am not sure how to use its features.  (Note that I am very proficient on my mac in every other respect, software development, html, photoshop, illustrator, all those I manage just fine, but iMovie is so confusing. I feel like I just need a 20 minute leg up in a tutorial or something like that.)  h2Update:/h2  Here's a screenshot of what I am using: I have played with it a while and I don't see any commands which would make it look like the screenshot in the help screenshot provided below... emwhat am i missing?????/em  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/baYgj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer113721> If you're looking for a video tutorial, this screencast on YouTube is pretty helpful:  ul liNEW iMovie 2013: The Basics and Overview (In-Depth Tutorial)/li /ul  Apple provides a very detailed guide on iMovie, available from Help → iMovie Help or online.  ul lihttp://help.apple.com/imovie/mac/10.0/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/phyXd.jpg" alt="Help Center → iMovie Help"  <comment133453> Yes I saw that but I am still not clear on some basic concepts... Events, Projects, Clips, what does all that really mean? Also the screen I see when I run it is totally different from what I see in the help (e.g. the screenshot above even...) <comment133454> @pitosalas Which version of iMovie do you have? What are you referring to 'seeing differently'? The timeline won't be the same because you won't have added any clips. <comment133455> well the about box says 10.0.1 which I think is the latest, although everyone talks about iMovie '11 which I thought stood for 2011, which is really an old copy. But I am pretty certain it's the most recent one... Is it? <comment133456> @pitosalas Yes 10.0.1 is the latest. Do you get anything that resembles that screenshot or something *completely* different? <comment133458> see in original post, I added a screenshot. It's similar but I can't see where and how all those panes come from. I am sounding really dumb, but I am missing just a few nuggets of info to get going, hence, looking a screencast/tutorial or what not :)..... And by the way, why do the call it iMovie '11? <comment133460> @pitosalas You have to import some footage first for it to show something! Click the Import button on the toolbar and select your footage :) iMovie '11 is iMovie 9. I've added a link to a tutorial on YouTube.
