Can I used the command line to disable settings in Yosemite that have made my Mac visible? <body> Recent changes to my machine as the result of an upgrade to Yosemite (OS X 10.10) have made my machine visible on Bluetooth and Bonjour, where it was not visible before.  Is there a command line way to disable/enable the relevant features so that my machine can be restored to "invisibility" to these services (e.g. when I'm in a less secure environment)?  <answer152225> h2Bonjour/h2  Prior, to Yosemite this could be done via codelaunchctl/code, so using:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist /code/pre  would turn Bonjour off, and to turn it back on:  precodesudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist /code/pre  Unfortunately code/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder/code is not found on Yosemite.  A bit of digging and this seems to work for Bonjour:  precodesudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.discoveryd.plist /code/pre  strongNB:/strong emI'm not clear if this means it stays off, it should given codelaunchctl/code behaviour but I've have strongnot/strong had time to test it and determine if anything else in the system will turn it back on./em  h2Bluetooth/h2  Presuming you're talking about your Mac's built-in bluetooth and not a third party adaptor, then:  precodenetworksetup -listallnetworkservices /code/pre  emLists all services, usually show Bluetooth as 'Bluetooth DUN'/em  precodekillall blued /code/pre  emKills the bluetooth server process/em  h3Launchctl commands/h3  precodelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist /code/pre  emUnload the bt daemon/em  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist /code/pre  emReload the bt daemon/em  precodelaunchctl start com.apple.blued /code/pre  emRestart blued daemon/em  <answer205127> As mentioned by notacouch, cppl's answer doesn't work on Yosemite as killall blued doesn't find the process.  As recommended on notacouch shared URL's you need to do this: Open the Terminal utility  Run the following two commands:  precodesudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport; sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport /code/pre  When done, if Bluetooth is off then turn it back on and choose your devices from the Bluetooth menu. As a quick tip, you can select both of the commands above and then drag the selection to a Finder window, to create a text clipping of them in a convenient location (such as your Desktop). You can then quickly run the commands by dragging the clipping to a new Terminal window.

Even with the above bluetooth wouldn't shut off (`killall blued` couldn't find the process).  This article did the trick for me: http://www.macissues.com/2015/05/07/overcome-bluetooth-devices-not-staying-paired-after-sleeping-os-x/  Replicate what happens at boot:  `sudo kextunload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport`  `sudo kextload -b com.apple.iokit.BroadcomBluetoothHostControllerUSBTransport`
