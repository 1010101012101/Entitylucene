Downloads folder grid view showing artifacts <body> When expanding the Downloads folder from the dock, in grid view, tooltips shown for long file name are leaving graphical artifacts after they disappear. There is a link below with a screen recording showing the issue.  If you have any hint on how to fix this, please leave a comment.  Screen recording  <comment246226> It looks like you have a problem with a Spotlight importer specific to mobi files.  By dragging a 'folder' containing at least one mobi ebook file onto the right end of my dock I duplicated the behavior (OS X 10.10.5, Macbook 5,1). <comment246338> I don't think it's related to the file type, I could reproduce this with a folder containing just pdf files. It just shows those artifacts whenever I expand the grid view of a dock folder. <comment246346> I've only got two mdimpoters/qlgenerators installed and don't get anything but .mobi files to do this.
