Does Apple scan iCloud e-mail like Google does with Gmail? <body> Does anyone know if Apple scans e-mail for marketing purposes like Google does with Gmail?  Or maybe the iCloud e-mail encrypted all the way from client to server/database such that Apple couldn't even read it?  <answer75214> With MobileMe, Apple did filter (and block) email:br http://www.cultofmac.com/103703/apple-may-be-invisibly-filtering-your-outgoing-mobileme-email-exclusive/br However, I tried the test mentioned in the article using iCloud email, and the email went through just fine.  EDIT: Turns out they do, just not in the same way.br http://www.cultofmac.com/217557/apples-deleting-icloud-emails-that-contain-the-phrase-barely-legal-teens/  <comment87058> I don't think they scan it for ad words like google does; iAds are banners that show up in apps, not in email.
