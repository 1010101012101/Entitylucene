How to get an iMessage conversation to go back from green to blue? <body> After some overseas travel my imessage conversation with my contact (also an iPhone user) switched from blue (iMessage) to green (SMS) - due to problems with international roaming.   We're back in our home country, but the message conversation persists in SMS (green) and we'd like it to go back to iMessage (blue). I don't know how to click it back over.

Then the green send arrow will be blue (just like it was when you  originally sent the current message).  <answer290756> Delete the conversation that has text messages messaging. Create a new conversation. Basically, replacing it. This is of course, a 'last resort' kind of option.  <comment299883> Try temporarily turning off **Settings**  **Messages**  **Send as SMS**. Then send some messages.  It their back to blue you can turn **Send as SMS** back on and sent additional messages to ensure they're still blue. <comment299919> Why does clearing app switcher do anything ? Surely all you need to do for what you suggest is kill Message - and even then what does that do <comment299922> Its just a good practice in order to have no processes running in the background, a way to have anything clearer @Mark <comment299924> but apps do not run in the background in iOS when you switch away the process is shut down by the OS <comment299931> Then it's just a clearing purpose, except for the Message app which is good to get the rid of from the Switcher as it will restart the App @Mark <comment299932> It is not even a clearing process as a closed app has no resources open (OK they might be in memory but will be removed f needed) <comment299933> I just suggest to do that before doing anything, if you think  you can skip it, please feel free to do that @Mark <comment299942> -1 for suggesting that 'Clearing the App Switcher' is a good way to start any phone triage. <comment299943> I've added the label 'Optional', even though I think you're focusing on the wrong part of my answer, but I respect opinions <comment299991> This does not provide an answer to the question.

Really appreciate how comprehensive it is and covers off a lot of possible root causes. The simpler one in the other answer worked for me but this will be good for other people. <comment299996> Glad you've solved your issue and I could do something for it, have a great day @hawkeye <comment300014> I take it back - I thought this worked but it didn't - now trying other options <comment300630> @hawkeye, it's still stuck on green? <comment337611> @StephenCollins That's gone now, courtesy of yours truly. Bad start indeed!
