Why can't I use the mute button when using Airplay as an output device? <body> From my MacBook Pro I send all audio using Airplay to my Airplay Express. I can adjust the volume with the volume buttons (kbdF11/kbd and the kbdF12/kbd keys) but I can't use the mute button on the kbdF10/kbd key. It shows me the following when I press it:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FDw1h.png" alt="enter image description here"    Why is that? Can I somehow make the mute key work with an Airplay device?
