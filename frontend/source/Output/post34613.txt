Unable to boot up with Snow Leopard DVD <body> I accidentally deleted my /bin folder. My computer is now permanently stuck at the Apple screen with an infinite spinning indicator.  I have:  ol liInserted my Snow Leopard DVD/li liHeld down c - nothing/li liHeld down option - shows me Macintosh HD, but then hangs/li /ol  I am not sure how I can just start fresh and install a clean build of Snow Leopard?  <answer34618> Create a bootable flash with Mac OS X, then hold down options and load from that drive. Then just install a clean build as usual.
