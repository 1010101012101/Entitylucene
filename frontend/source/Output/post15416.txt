MacBook Pro Dual LCD <body> Would it be possible to customize a macbook so that it has 2 screens instead of 1?  what i mean is, could i hook up the lcd from another macbook and connect so that it has 2 screens..  if it could work, would i have to connect it via minidisplayport or is there a way to connect it to the video board..  essentially something like this..  http://www.freeonsmash.com/news/2008/12/12/apple-macbook-tribook/  <answer15419> Check this, maybe cover your needs:  precodehttp://www.screenrecycler.com/ScreenRecycler.html /code/pre  but it is commercial 30$.  (You sure know this: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924)  <comment16725> how is screenrecycler different from http://synergy-foss.org/  ? <comment16728> Yeah but it's not the same is it? Synergy is pretty much an automatic keyboard-mouse switch whereas ScreenRecycler is using the second computer's display as a display for your first computer. <comment16729> @XQYZ - youre right. The synergy is only a sort of kvm. So, you can share your mouse and keyboard between more systems, but does not externd the current system with a second display. <comment16732> @XQYZ you are right. Guess I was a bit too jumpy
