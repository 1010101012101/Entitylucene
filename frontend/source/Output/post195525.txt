Email forwarding - iOS <body> Someone sent me an email with an image attached. I want to review the image and forward it to someone else. How do I do that?  <answer195528> Using the application Mail click on your mail. Then click in the bottom bar the strong4th icon that is an arrow/strong. Press strongForward/strong. If it asks if you want to include attachments from original message, press strongInclude/strong. Then just fill the information depending on who do you want to send it to.  <comment233426> I want to download the image then resize it and send it to someone else. <comment233436> so what is holding you back in downloading then resizing then attaching to new email ?
