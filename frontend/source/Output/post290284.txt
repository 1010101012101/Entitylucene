Folder popup grid on Tiger dock? <body> So, I have many Macintoshes, as such I am running various copies of macOS. One of my favourite changes to the dock in recent versions has been the additional options for handling folders that have been pinned to the dock. Most specifically the ability to browse the contents via a popup grid. I'm not a fan of the fan, no pun intended, but the grid view is so helpful as far as I'm concerned that I use it for exclusively launching any apps I don't keep in my dock.  Well, I recently hopped back onto my old PowerMac G4 with a corrupted copy of macOS Panther on it, and clean installed a copy of Tiger. As I just said my copy of Panther had been corrupted, and I hadn't been able to get any installers to boot for years, so I had forgotten what a pain the list view for folders was.  I'd like to be able to more easily launch apps from my dock without cluttering the left side with anything non-essential, but as far as I'm concerned the list view is so cumbersome due to the massive number of tiny selections all packed vertically that it's easier to just left click it and launch them from a Finder window. That then also becomes a pain, especially with apps that open large or fullscreen windows by default because now there's a Finder window lingering on the bottom layer taking up space on the screen as well as out of the system pool.  So, does anyone know of a way to implement the newer large icon 'fan' or 'grid' views for docked folders in Tiger? If not, is there any way I could implement this feature or something equivalent myself using Automator (perhaps a Finder window that auto-closes when focus shifts to another window)? Thanks in advance.
