characters in login screen replaced by question marks <body> My log-in screen appears with question marks instead of the usual text. (See screen shot - I have removed my log-in name from the picture).  I am using MacOS Sierra 10.12.3 on a MacBook Pro (early 2011). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYV01.jpg" alt=" "  <answer272944> The issue is under your text encoding. You may want to reinstall the text encoding by heading over to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongLanguage/strong, and adding a random dummy language using the strong+/strong button on the bottom left. Remove your original language, and then add it again. You can then remove the dummy language. Everything should be fine after that.   strongIf not:/strong   The issue will be under your fonts.      strong1./strong Run validations with Font Book      Launch Font Book and press command-A to select all fonts. Then from   the "File" menu select "Validate Fonts" and wait for the results in   the font validation window. Keep in mind that even though you may find   minor problems with your current fonts, its best to follow the saying   "if it's not broken then don't fix it", and leave well-enough alone   unless you're experiencing problems.      strong2./strong Clear the font cache      In OS X, fonts are handled by the Apple Type Server process, which   stores commonly used fonts in a cache for quick access. If there is   corruption in this cache then you may experience a variety of   troubles. To clear the cache, in pre-Leopard versions of OS X go to   the /Macintosh HD/Library/Caches/ folder and remove the   "com.apple.ATS" file. After doing this, restart the system.      For OS X 10.5 and later, you cannot easily access the user and global   font caches, but you can use Apple's "atsutil" terminal command to   manage the ATS process. Open "Terminal" and enter the following   commands to clear the user (or global) databases and restart the   server:      atsutil databases -removeUser atsutil server -shutdown atsutil server   -ping      NOTE: Use "sudo atsutil databases -remove" instead of the first   command to remove the database for all users.      strong3./strong Avoid older font formats      If you can, avoid ".dfont" and "Type 1 PostScript" fonts. This   suggestion may depend on the requirements for various programs, but if   you have an older font suite that you are thinking about installing,   it may run into problems with newer programs so you might consider   getting an updated version of the suite before installing. Granted you   can always try, but there is the potential that older font formats can   cause problems so we recommend you stick to the more modern ".ttf" and   ".ttc" fonts.      strong4./strong Manually clear out duplicates      Font Book has an option to "Resolve Duplicates" (available in the   "Edit" menu), but this is limited in functionality and may not remove   the specific font duplicate which you desire to remove. As such, the   best approach to managing duplicate fonts is to do it manually   (tedious, but effective if done correctly). In Font Book, you can use   the "Show Font info" option (command-I) to see information about a   selected font, and especially where the font is located on your   system. Doing this for your duplicate fonts will allow you to select   which one to remove, either by removing it from its font folder, or by   right-clicking it and selecting "Disable".   strongFrom:/strong https://www.cnet.com/news/font-problems-and-management-in-os-x/  <answer272947> Try going to Applications/Font Book/ and do File  Restore Standard Fonts and restart.  <comment341721> What language text encoding are you using? <comment342048> English (Australia) <comment343088> Booting in Safe Mode gives the correct characters <comment343107> The issue is in your text encoding, let me post an answer soon <comment361243> This happens to me after my mac get somewhat slow and unresponsive
