Cannot play songs on Itunes list <body> Have the songs in the playlists but when click play it shows the song to be played but the song does not play  <comment192008> on what device ? <comment192041> Way too little info here.  As Buscar points out what device? Where did the songs come from? are they iTunes purchases? ripped CDs? another online source? <comment192143> Sorry I thought the tag would show - its on itunes 12.0.  you can click on the song in the play list and select play or double click and the song does not play.
