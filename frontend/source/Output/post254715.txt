Unable to verify account name or password despite using correct details <body> I've had this problem for a while, but I hate not knowing or getting to the bottom of things, so here I am! :)  On an iMac I am running El Capitan 10.11.6 and in the Mail app I successfully send and receive emails from five separate accounts. So all seems good.  However, if I go to System Preferences  Internet Accounts and manually select each of these five accounts, for two of them I get the following emCan't connect to the account/em error message:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JIYj.png" alt="enter image description here"  Now, when I enter my password, I get the emUnable to verify account name or password/em prompt in red text:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/McuMM.png" alt="enter image description here"  I manage my own domain and email accounts, so know for a fact I have the correct passwords. And, as I said, I am using these accounts fine within Mail. I also use them fine on various iPhones and iPads and other Macs.  Any suggestions as to what's going on?  <answer273102> I was having this issue also, tried restarting the computer, editing the SMTP, nothing worked. I went into internet accounts and clicked the remove button (-) in the bottom left. After removing and re-adding the account everything seems to be working fine!  <answer295419> This is a frustrating bug! Here's what worked for me, though I don't know which of these things ended up doing the trick (Mac OS 10.12.6, Mail 10.3):  ol liOpen Mail preferences and on the accounts tab paste the new password into the Server Settings tab./li liDisable the account on the Account Information tab./li liRestart the whole computer./li liLaunch mail, open up preferences again to the accounts tab (this time it showed a green "Online" status)./li liRe-enable the account on the account information tab./li liAt this point, for some reason Mail thinks the account is offline, though I never set it to offline. Click the get mail button and it will ask if you want to bring the account online, click bring all accounts online./li /ol  And finally after all that it started working again. This is so ridiculous. Whoever thought you would have to reboot your entire Mac just to update your email password.  <comment317134> Try prefsAccountsAdvanced & see if 'Automatically detect & maintain...' is enabled. I've known that to change the port & SSL settings below. <comment317142> @Tetsujin Thanks for the suggestion. Did you mean System Preferences  Internet Accounts  Advanced ? If so, I don't get the _Automatically detect & maintain..._ option. <comment317145> Mail prefs, sorry - it's set individually for each account <comment317146> There are actually 2 places, one for incoming, one for outgoing [sorry, I'd forgotten, been a while since I did it] The other is in Outgoing SMTP  edit  advanced. <comment317147> Ah, found it. The _Automatically detect & maintain..._ option is enabled. So are you suggesting I should I uncheck the box? <comment317152> I've found it to be far more stable since I disabled mine. It was randomly picking new SSL ports for me... which didn't work <comment317155> Thanks for the suggestion. It didn't solve this issue, but I'll keep that option off for a while to see what happens over time. <comment363585> Since I don't have enough reputation, I put it here in the comments. This happened to me after I changed my password. I solved this by going to: Mail - Preferences - Accounts - Server Settings and then in the Password field changing it to the new password. Mails finally started coming in again ;)
