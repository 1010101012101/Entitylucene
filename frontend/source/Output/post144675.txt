iWork'08 sumifs equivalent in Numbers <body> Does iWork '08 have a codesumifs/code type command? If not, how can I sum on multiple conditions? Essentially how do I fo the following:  precode=sumifs(A$2:A$20,B$2:B$20,"&lt;10",C$2:C$20,"female) /code/pre  many thanks!  <answer144677> Numbers 09 has the SUMIFS function, which operates the same as in Excel. Numbers 08 does not appear to have it, but it has codeSUMIF/code.  You should still be able to do what you are trying by combining two logical statements.  Without using the function, you could also build a new column by multiplying values by a logical statement. For example:  precode=A3 + A4 Ã— (B4&gt;2)  /code/pre  This will only add codeA4/code if codeB4/code is greater than 2...  Or in your example, make a column using codeAND/code:  precode=A2 x AND(B2&lt;10,exact(C2,"female)) /code/pre  Then sum that column. Values that don't meet both criteria will be zero.  <comment170494> Great ideas, thanks!
