Can't remove my old number from apple id <body> I can't seem to find the solution to completely removing my old number from my Apple ID and linking a new one. I just bought an iphone 7 (with a new number) and wanted to use my old apple ID so that the contacts and the data could sync. However, my new number won't automatically appear on imessage "send &amp; receive" section only my email address shows. I've signed out of my old iphone and even reset all its settings. I've also tried signing out of my apple ID in this iphone 7 and restarting it, but nothing happens. Only my email address shows on imessage and when I check my account in appleid.apple.com:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVml6.png" alt="my account"  My old number remains and can't be removed even though I've signed out from imessage and facetime on my old device.   What should I do?  help please  <comment359248> Deregister iMessage from your old number: https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage/
