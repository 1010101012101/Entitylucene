Unable to see battery life suggestions, and app usage %under battery section <body> Hope someone can help me with this and save me a trip to the Apple Store. I have iPhone 5S, upgraded to iOS 10.0.2. I normally stay on lower power mode. I don't seem to have any problems with battery life after the upgrade.  I notice that when I got to Settings  Battery, I see the lower power mode toggle, battery percentage toggle and time since last full charge. However, I don't see the "Battery Life Suggestions" which I know is part of iOS 10. Also, I no longer see the % of battery different apps use, there is nothing there. It just says, "Battery information will be available after using iPhone for a few minutes" but the app icons are not there. All that is showing are the above two toggles and "time since last full charge information". I did a hard reset and no change ... I did not reset all network settings however. Anyone else seeing this problem or know of a solution? Thanks.   <comment316805> This problem has plagued many devices since it was introduced.  I've never seen a real solution to it but many people have reported success by doing a restore of their device.  I don't know why that works (and it doesn't work 100% of the time). <comment333431> I had the same problem. "Battery information will be available after using iPhone for a few minutes" and a message saying it had been 1h 34m since my last full charge - which was absolute rubbish. Quitting the settings app and reloading would show progress indicator and then display the same information.  Did a power off and restart - then displayed the same message and time since last full charge is blank with a message "Usage times will be shown after iPhone is fully charged". Then after getting to 100% full charge, time since last full charge is updating but still no other usage info. :(
