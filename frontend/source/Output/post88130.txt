Change canvas size in Preview.app without scaling image? <body> I have a PNG that I want to add additional content to. For this I need to increase the canvas size of the image: Just make the image larger, but without scaling the existing contents (which the Adjust Size tool seems to insist on doing).  How can I do this?  <answer88141> One option would be to Cut and paste using ⌘-ALT-X and ⌘V after resizing the canvas size in destination file. The pasted image doesn't seem to get snapped to canvas edges now.  Increasing canvas size by cropping doesn't seem to be possible.  <answer95889> The best method I have found is:  ol liTake a screenshot that is larger than your image you are working on, I usually take a shot of an empty text document so that it is entirely white. /li liPaste your image onto the new image, and then add your other pasted image as well./li liSelect the new combination image and copy it and make a final image by creating a new one from the clipboard. /li /ol  This method only works if your two or more images are smaller than your screenshot image, but it works 95% of the time for me.  <answer187054> This works well for me:   ol liSelect all (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdA/kbd) and cut (kbdcmd/kbd+kbdX/kbd) the image from its canvas (convert to png if asked). /li liResize the image as desired from the "Tools" menu (unlock the proportions if desired)/li liRe-paste original image from the clipboard and move it where you want it on the resized canvas/li liUse kbdcmd/kbd+kbd-/kbd if necessary to zoom out (you'll see checkerboard where the canvas is and white beyond)/li liPaste in other images, etc, as you like/li /ol  <comment110763> Pragmatic solution 3 <comment170084> Nice quick and dirty solution. I noticed the quality of my image seemed to drop though, so watch out for that. <comment369658> ProTip: If you don't see the checkerboard select "Show Image Background" (Opt+Cmd+B) from the View menu.
