How to recover data from iPhone backup files WITHOUT the info.plist, status.plist, manifest.plist, manifest.mbdb, and manifest.mbdx files? <body> I have iTunes 10.5 and Mac OS X version 10.6.8.  I would like to restore my iPhone from backup.  iTunes detects all my backups EXCEPT one, which happens to be the backup I want.   I looked in the backup directory (strong~/library/application support/mobilesync/backup/strong) and IT IS THERE along with the other backups. HOWEVER, unlike the other backups, it's missing five files: stronginfo.plist/strong, strongstatus.plist/strong, strongmanifest.plist/strong, strongmanifest.mbdb/strong, and strongmanifest.mbdx/strong.   I have tried applications that can extract data, like the free iPhone Backup Extractor for example, but they work only if I have the five files.   Is there a way to recover data without the five files?  <answer133283> Directly restoring from iTunes backup, you have no choice by restoring the entire backup. It's the rule from Apple. But if you still need to do this, you can choose to find an iTunes backup extract tool, which is usually used to extract the iTunes backup file. Then you can preview and selectively recover whatever you want from it.
