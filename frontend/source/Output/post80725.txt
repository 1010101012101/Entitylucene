How to connect to a VPN with PPTP that uses CHAP and MS-CHAP? <body> My employer recently changed our VPN that we use while working remote and sent some new instructions for setting up our windows machines to connect to it.  Following the instructions, I basically just added a couple of DNS servers and was able to get the VPN working on my windows laptop.  Unfortunately, I've not had the same luck with my MacBook.  I log in with my username and password, and it authenticates to verify those credentials are correct, and it even has the VPN connection icon on like it is running.  However, I can't access any of the network like I should be when the VPN was actually working before.  Our new VPN uses a PPTP connection with CHAP AND MS-CHAP. As mentioned above, on the windows machine, I also provide Preferred DNS and Alternate DNS server.  Is connection even possible with the VPN tool under networking?  What do I need to do to get this connection to work again on my Mac?
