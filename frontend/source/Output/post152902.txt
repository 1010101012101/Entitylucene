How to let Time Machine automatically delete older backup files to free up disk space? <body> How to let Time Machine automatically delete older backup files to free up disk space?

It will delete older backups, but in this case it's telling that _after deleting any existing backups_ there still will not be enough space for the backup. It is trying to backup 561 GB. Did you recently add a lot of media or a new hard drive to your system?
