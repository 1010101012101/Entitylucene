Epson software update keeps popping up on my screen but nothing gets downloaded <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/T1h7U.png" alt="enter image description here"  I get that question pop-up on my screen a few times per day. Sometimes several times in a row. If I say Yes, a long EULA document appears for me to accept, then a window with a progress bar that reaches about half the way before I get this: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vPYvd.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I go to Software Update, nothing appears in the list. All my software is up to date.   Selecting No closes the dialog but it may reappear again in seconds.   I got tired of this, removed my printer from Print/Scan settings, used Epson uninstaller utility (found on their site) to remove their drivers and software from the system, rebooted the machine, plugged in my printer back and OS X downloaded drivers and installed them again. All was well for about a week. Today this started again. Any insight into fixing this would be appreciated.  <answer77636> Just talked with Epson support. I had already removed the printer from System Preferences  Print &amp; Scan, but when I tried to add the printer back it said the software could not be found. In talking with Epson this what he had me do:  ol liI had already removed the printer so do this first./li liOpen System Preferences  Print &amp; Scan, right-click in the list of printers on the left, and choose "Reset printing system..."/li liRun the Software Update under the Apple menu. (Being Mountain Lion this opened the App Store application. However, there were no software updates for me.)/li liRestart computer./li liOpen System Preferences  Print &amp; Scan and add the printer again./li /ol  It was able to add the printer, and now the dialog box in @King Julian's post is not showing for me. Hope this works for others too.  <comment88941> I have the exact same issue, only with an HP printer. Every time I plug it in, it asks if I want to download the drivers; I say yes, and then it says they're unavailable. Yet it still prints fine anyway... <comment89435> I have a feeling this is somehow related to me using Parallels. Are you using Parallels on your machine by any chance? <comment89448> I am! Interesting... <comment89966> I'm not using Parallels, but this is happening with my Epson printer (CX7400) every time a user logs in. (There are multiple users on my Mac.) Any solutions yet?
