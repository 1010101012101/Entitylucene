Modify .inetloc file linking AppleScript to allow parentheses <body> I found an AppleScript that creates code.inetloc/code files allowing people to link to files on a company server. In my testing, it worked great, but it turns out that the script can't handle parentheses, code()/code, in the file name, which there turn out to be a lot of. Is there a way to allow this script to link to files that include parentheses?  In order to use the script, paste this text into Script Editor, save it as an application, and then I usually drag it to the dock. Once you've done that, you can navigate to a file on the server and click the dock link. If the file was codefile.doc/code you'll get a new codefile.doc.inetloc/code in the same folder.  precodetell application "Finder" repeat with elt in (get selection)     set filepath to POSIX path of (elt as string)     set filename to name of elt     set parentdir to container of elt     set fileurl to do shell script "/bin/echo -n file://" &amp; filepath &amp; " | ruby -ruri -p -e '$_=URI.encode$_'"       make new internet location file at parentdir to fileurl with properties {name:filename} end repeat end tell /code/pre
