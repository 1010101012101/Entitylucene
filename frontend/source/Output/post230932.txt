Problem with external monitor and MacBook Air <body> I cannot connect my MacBook Air to an external monitor. But I am able to connect it to a projector, without any difficulty. My computer detects the external monitor but cannot connect to it. The screen is just black  ul liI have tried everything in the System Preferences  Display  Resolution category. Does not work, but any clue will help!/li liI have upgraded everything on my Mac, so that it is now OS X El Capitan. /li liI have tried to deconnect and reconnent the cable connecting to the screen. /li liOther MacBook Air work with the monitors I want to use, and they all work./li liI have tried the sleep-mode to get it to detect the mac/screen./li liI have tried changing the VGA cable. /li /ul  I have tried almost everything, what am I missing?  <answer231064> Are you connecting using 100Hz for example on a 60 Hz monitor? The monitor will turn black then and appears to be disconnected. There should be an option to cast it as a different Hz to your monitor.  <comment281943> Are you connecting using 100Hz for example on a 60 Hz monitor? Does a different monitor work? <comment282092> I have tried with 2 different monitors and it is the same problem. I was suggested by apple support that it might be a software issue, but I dont know what kind of software that should be?  And I dont know how to find out about the 60Hz and 100Hz :/ <comment282094> It appears to be 60Hz! found it :)
