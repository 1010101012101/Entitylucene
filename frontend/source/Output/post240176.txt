Update iPhone 4s from iOS 7 to iOS 9.0.2 without iTunes <body> I want to upgrade my iPhone 4s from iOS 7 to iOS 9.0.2 without iTunes, because iTunes has an unsolved error during restore: Error 3194. I followed the link to try to fix error 3194, but the error remains.  I've downloaded iOS 9.0.2 firmware and it's on my hard disk. Now how can I totally erase my phone and install new the new version of iOS?  I jailbroke my phone some years ago and I think the error is related to it. Is there another tool which lets me restore my device?  <comment295121> stackexchange always act like that. why downvote this time? <comment295181> Quick answer is no, there's no way to install iOS without iTunes. It used to be possible with redsn0w, but it still used Apple's servers to verify the install, and there isn't any way around that if you have an iPhone 4s. <comment295591> Do you get the same error if you try restoring to the latest version of iOS (9.3.2)? Apple's servers stop allowing restores of older versions soon after new updates are released.
