How to automatically paste today's date with keyboard shortcut? <body> I am on El Capitan OS X.  I want to be able to hit some keyboard shortcut and then have today's date be automatically outputted.  Example:  When I press Option + D, "2016_06_13" is pasted into the text field.  The date would be automatically calculated based on my time zone.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to do this universally. So in Finder, Safari, TextEdit, etc. — not just exclusive to one program.  Having this shortcut would streamline my workflow.  Is this possible?  <answer242552> The easiest way I know of to do this is with 3rd-party text expansion apps.  Personally I use Typinator, with a rule that expands the word codedt/code (i.e. typing kbdD/kbd then kbdT/kbd) to code{YYYY}_{MM}_{DD}/code, which is Typinator's placeholder format for the current date.  The program uses the local system time and OS accessibility features to fill into nearly any text field, so it would be a good fit for your use case.  There are other programs that also do this, the most well known of which is probably TextExpander.  Lifehacker has a good round-up of text expansion apps from a few years ago which may be worth a look.  It is also possible to accomplish this with AppleScript and a launching application like Alfred or Quicksilver, as in this answer, but for me the convenience of being able to expand many different abbreviations with an easy-to-learn syntax and UI outweighs the cost savings of using AppleScript.  <answer242577> h3You could do it with Automator like this:/h3  ol liCreate new: codeServices/code/li liServices receives kbdno input/kbd in kbdany application/kbd/li liUse the search to find and add action: codeRun Applescript/code  ul liCopy and paste the following to the field on the right:/li /ul/li /ol  hr  precodetell application "System Events"     set _Date to (current date)     keystroke ¬         (year of _Date as text) &amp; "_" &amp; ¬         text -2 thru -1 of ("00" &amp; ((month of _Date) as integer)) &amp; "_" &amp; ¬         (day of _Date as text) end tell /code/pre  Note that the codeday/code will not have a leading zero like the codemonth/code does. If you want that, you could replace the line with: code(day of _Date as text)/code with: codetext -2 thru -1 of ("00" &amp; ((day of _Date) as integer))/code  hr  ol start="4" liSave with: kbdCmd/kbd + kbdS/kbd.

You should find it at the bottom area of the list. Then you just double click the codenone/code text on the right side of the service name and give it a shortcut./li /ol  <comment298458> It's not the best method (as far as the shell script and applescript goes), so in case anyone wondering why I did it this way, it's because when I first wrote this answer, I had it implanted in my head that OP wanted to copy the current date to clipboard, so I wrote an answer that did that. Then I realized he wanted to actually print out the date, so I expanded my answer with a simple applescript that pastes the clipboard contents... so problem solved... Obviously it may be undesirable if you'd like to keep what is inside your clipboard. I just don't want to rewrite the answer. <comment308395> Would it be possible to learn how to do this without clipboard interference? <comment308421> @rubik'ssphere Updated the answer.
