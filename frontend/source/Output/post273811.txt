Deleting Local Backup <body> Last Week I found that the local backup took about strong20-30 GB free space/strong on my MacBook Air and I deleted them using:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  I weekly backup my notebook using my external harddrive with Time Machine. Was it important to keep local backup on my Mac and spare 20-30 GB space or because I weekly backup to the external drive, it is not necessary to leave it open ?  <answer273831> Unless you are traveling and won't have access to your external backup drive, disabling the local backup is OK. I would backup your laptop with more frequency, however, unless all your data is stored in the cloud somewhere.  Lastly, if you take your laptop to work regularly, keep a second external HD in your desk and use Time Machine to create a second backup.  <comment344282> My most data is cloudly backuped in iCloud, only folders like downloads are not in it. I always carry my external HDD in my case with my notebook. Thank you for the answer.
