How can I instal VirtualBox without Admin permissions? <body> I am using a MacBook Air. Its got a 60gb harddrive. I want to install VirtualBox so I can run Horizon, Modio, and Usb XTAF explorer. I've tried using Crossover (I don't know how it works :(. I tried using unpkg and dragging and dropping the install items to where the install would put them, but I can't edit those files without authentication, which requires administrator permissions. Please help me? :)  <answer66466> Well if you don't have the admin rights, ask the admin to do the installation. Because the rights are required ...   <comment78423> VirtualBox and Crossover are two quite different things. Which one do you want to install? <comment86666> Some people have administrators who are afraid of technology.
