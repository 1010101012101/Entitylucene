Start or Stop Apache without having to give a password? <body> On Ubuntu you can do something like this:  precodesudo adduser {username} www-data /code/pre  That doesn't work on OS X, and may not be the best approach anyway.  On OS X, how can you make Apache start or stop without having to enter a password?  <answer231957> Open Terminal and enter codesudo visudo/code to modify the file em/etc/sudoers/em.  Change the part:  precode## User privilege specification ## root ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL /code/pre  to  precode## User privilege specification ## root ALL=(ALL) ALL %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apachectl /code/pre  and save the file.  If you don't know emvi/em: after entering codesudo visudo/code you have to change to eminsert mode/em by hitting kbdi/kbd. Enter the additional line as indicated above. To leave eminsert mode/em hit kbdesc/kbd. Then enter kbd:/kbdkbdw/kbdkbdq/kbd and the kbdEnter/kbd key to write the modified file to disk and quit vi.  Starting and stoping Apache with codesudo apachectl start/code or codesudo apachectl stop/code doesn't require a password anymore.  hr  codeapachectl/code requires root/sudo to execute it. Only the root user can execute the command without entering a password. Neither adding a user to the admin group nor to another group (e.g. _www) allows to execute code(sudo )apachectl/code without password.  So, the least intrusive method is adding a user - even a standard user - in the sudoers file and restrict the account to execute /usr/sbin/apachectl only. The added user is not allowed to execute any other command as sudoer!  <comment283425> Is this better than adding yourself to a group that already has such permissions?  Or is there no such group on OS X?
