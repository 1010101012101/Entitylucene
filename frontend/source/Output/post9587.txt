How can I open a text file with TextWrangler from the Terminal (command line)? <body> Often when I work in the Terminal (the command line) I need to edit some text files. I prefer to edit text files using TextWrangler.  How can I open a text file with TextWrangler from the Terminal?  I tried with code/Applications/TextWrangler.app/ my_text_file.txt/code but it doesn't work since codeTextWrangler.app//code is a directory.  <answer9588> As a one-time thing,  precodeopen -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app myfile.txt open -b com.barebones.textwrangler myfile.txt # same thing by ID /code/pre  You can also create an codealias/code for opening TextWrangler, that you would put on the code.bash_profile/code file, which is an hidden file by default that is usually in your home directory.   This is the command that you could insert:  precode# Type 'tw' on the terminal to open TextWrangler alias tw='open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app' /code/pre  To make TextWrangler the default:  ol li"Get Info" on a text file in the Finder./li liChange the "Open with:" program to TextWrangler, in the fifth information pane./li liClick the "Change All..." button at the bottom of the pane./li /ol  <answer9592> If you have the TextWrangler command line tools installed you can use 'edit' to open files in TextWrangler from the command line. You should have been prompted at the initial install to install the tools, or you can go to the preferences and the "Tools" section and click the installer button. It also gives you twdiff, a TextWrangler-based diff tool. You can 'man edit' if the tools are installed to see all the switches available.  <answer9596> If you have the TextWrangler command line tools installed, you can just type  precodeedit my_text_file.txt /code/pre  in the terminal and it should open.   If this doesn't work you have to install the TextWrangler command line tools.   If you installed the MacApp store version, download the installer from this page:  http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/cmd-line-tools.html  If you downloaded from the BareBones Software site, there should be an "install command line tools" command in either the Application (TextWrangler) menu or the help menu. I think it's in the Text Wrangler menu.   <answer11015> IMO, using codeopen/code is the correct approach. However it requires a bit of typing, so you may want to consider creating a shell alias for it. This approach is also good if you don't want to change your default editors.  precode$ alias tw='open -a /Applications/TextWrangler.app' $ tw myfile.txt /code/pre  To have the alias available in every shell you open, just add the line to code.bashrc/code in your home directory. If you don't have a code.bashrc/code yet, just create it yourself and add the line. Then open a new terminal tab to try it out.  <comment10056> After making it the default, then you use `open file.txt`. <comment10075> You can leave out the path to the application completely, as `open` consults the LaunchServices DB. So `open -a TextWrangler file.txt` is enough. <comment105979> I just tried and installed TextWrangler, first time I open it asks for "installing command line tools" and voia-lah. <comment136073> @Peter, i wish i could give you a bounty for this! been trying to set textwrangler as my default git editor <comment146944> when you say "as a one-time thing", do you mean you only have to do it one time (and after that the prefs are saved), or do you mean it only applies one time (and after that you have to do it again to achieve the same result)? <comment170139> If you don't want to use TextWrangler (or any other code editor) as default editor for text files, you can also save a "shortcut" (actually, a shell alias) to make it easier to use TextWrangler on the terminal, typing for example something like tw myfile. Just add to your ~/.bash_profile something like alias tw='open -a TextWrangler' <comment242724> For Mac App Store version, the direct link to the command Line Tools Installer is http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/cmd-line-tools.html <comment244733> updated the link, thanks =) <comment336343> And, `open -a TextWrangler .` can conveniently open the current folder of text files.  â€¦ `alias twf='open -a TextWrangler.app . ` or just `tw .` with the above alias. <comment338933> This used to work, then I upgraded OS X... what happened?
