Enterprise Apps pushed using Profile Manager not executable <body> I have enrolled in the Volume Purchasing Program and successfully pushed App Store apps to a device. I am trying now to push an "Enterprise App" to a device which is not available on the App Store. So far I have tried 2 different free applications available as downloads from the developer's websites and encountered the same issue both times.  The app will get pushed to the host successfully, but gives the error "The Application [App Name] cannot be opened". Upon inspection, it appears that the actual executable file in the MacOS folder of the App has lost it's "x" flag. If I run codechmod +x/code on the contents of the MacOS folder, the app runs just fine.   I would love some insight as to why these files lose their executable flag and perhaps how to prevent this. If not preventable, is there a way to send a script along with the payload which would run chmod on the app? Is there some way to prepare the app before uploading it to the server for distribution?
