Small Windows 7 on Bootcamp <body> I am using MacBook Air 13". I need to install Windows 7 on my MB to run some software. I have about 30GB free space on my MB. Is there any Windows 7 distribution that uses less space and works with Bootcamp?  <answer134770> Straight from Microsoft editions of Windows are all the same size, the feature sets are unlocked by what edition you've paid for.   ul liprofessional/li lienterprise/li lihome and business/li listudent /li liultimate  /li /ul  All of them take up the same amount of space, but some have limited access to features.   hr  I would install the windows partition to an external drive. You strongmight/strong be able to squeak by with 30GB if you have less than 4GB of windows files.   <comment159559> If you're only needing Windows to run some software, why not use something like Wine?
