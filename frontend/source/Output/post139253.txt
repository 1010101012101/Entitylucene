iMac doesn't recognize external Monitor after wake up <body> I know there are a lot different topics on this, mostly for MBP's, but I did not found any solution for me though.  I have an iMac 27" late 2013 with 16GB RAM and an external Acer S232HL connected via miniDP - HDMI. It's working quite fine (most of the time) when I shut it down, but when I put the iMac to sleep and wake it up again the external monitor is not being recognized. I had the same problem with my MPBr 13" 2013 before I bought the iMac and called the hotline here in Germany. Everything they told me was to reset the SMC and PRAM / NVRAM, which I did and also tried with the iMac several times. Needless to say that it did not work :-) There is a workaround for me which is really frustrating: When the monitor is not being recognized I unplug the power and HDMI cable for about 1 minute or so, plug it in and OS X recognizes it again.  This is coming up since Mavericks as far as I remember. I am not that familiar with OS X yet as I switched from Windows in 2013, so if there is anything else I could try besides the usual things or if anyone has an idea where this might could come from.  I would really appreciate any help!  Thanks in advance!  <comment164208> Reported this Bug on 28-Oct-2013 04:52 PM  - ID #15331869 ... no Duplicate Mark since yet, still in contact with Apple Devs. - no solution yet, except working in Yosemite and workaround with disconnecting or reboot.
