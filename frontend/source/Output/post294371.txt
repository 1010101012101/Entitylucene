AppleScript: How to get the character count of an .rtf file? <body> I would like an AppleScript .scpt file to determine the character count of any given .rtf file. I'm not sure if this is standard for character counts, but I would like each space character (" ") to also count as one character.  I would like the script to accomplish this, without actually opening the file in TextEdit.   It is important to note that this is a rich text file, not a simple plain text (.txt) file. This fact complicates things. It is not as simple as chopping off the rich text header, because a single .rtf file may contain multiple different types of rich text formatting.  What is the best way to go about this?  <answer294375> You asked, "What is the best way to go about this?" and while I'll not make that determination, nonetheless, here's an example using the codedo shell script/code command and some command line utilities.  precodeset theRichTextFile to quoted form of "/path/to/filename.rtf" set theCharacterCount to do shell script "textutil -stdout -convert txt " &amp; theRichTextFile &amp; " | LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -m | sed 's/ //g'" /code/pre  Note that codetheRichTextFile/code must be a quoted POSIX pathname.  Update: Per comment by @jackjr300, added codeLANG=en_US.UTF-8/code to the command.  <comment371661> Note : The `Locale` is not defined in any shell when you use the `do shell script` command, So, the `wc` command count all ASCII character in any composed character. Example : the RTF file contains "**Здравствуйте!**" (a Russian word), the `wc` command return **25** (ASCII characters). To get the correct number, set the `LANG` to some lang.. with the **UTF-8**, like this :  `do shell script "textutil -stdout -convert txt '/path/of/someFile.rtf' |  LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -m | sed 's/ //g'"` -- now, the `wc` command return **13** (characters)
