access address book on unconnected time machine backup <body> I want to copy the address book from a time machine backup done before my reinstall.  However after opening the backup the library/application source does not show the address folder. Using the hidden library placed under favorites only opens the current backup! How do I get the old backup to open with the correct library and copy the old address book folder?
