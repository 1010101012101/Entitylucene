How to apply Preview's Actual Size to every picture? <body> On Mac, when I view a comic using Preview, I open like 200 pages, then I click the codeActual Size/code. But codeActual Size/code only applies to one picture only, and when I view the next picture, I have to click codeActual Size/code again.  Is there a way to apply codeActual Size/code to every picture?  <answer85665> I tried and opened few different sizes pictures. Then I used the "Select all" in the Preview Edit followed by "Actual Size". It worked for me :)  <answer256142> user44516's answer worked for me until I went through the pictures using kbdPage/kbd kbdUp/kbdand kbdPage/kbd kbdDown/kbd.   However, I found using "Previous Item kbd⌥ Option/kbdkbdUp/kbd and kbd⌥ Option/kbdkbdDown/kbd from the "Go" menu worked.
