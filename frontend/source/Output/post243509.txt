Refreshing env variables by sourcing not working <body> I installed torch in my MacBook Pro (running El Capitan). Now for using torch, I've to refresh env variables. Official torch document asks me to run codesource ~/.profile/code. But the terminal is showing strongNo such file or directory/strong. Please help.  Edit: Even code~/.bash_profile/code is giving strongNo such file or directory/strong.  <answer243515> It is likely that your Torch installer complained with the following message:  precodeNot updating your shell profile. You might want to add the following lines to your shell profile:  . ~/torch/install/bin/torch-activate /code/pre  You should manually add the suggested line to your profile. If you use codebash/code (which is default on OS X) you can do it by:  precodeecho . ~/torch/install/bin/torch-activate &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  and restart your shell, i.e. close and reopen the Terminal.  This will have the same effect as suggested codesource ~/.profile/code (so you don't have to run it).  <comment299874> Have you ~/.bash_profile . See many questions about what are the startup files for bash <comment299899> If you source a file in your current terminal session then there is no need to close and reopen the Terminal application. Also, you should enclose whatever you wish to echo (print) with quotes. <comment299904> @fd0 I don't see a reason to quote anything in `echo . ~/torch/install/bin/torch-activate  ~/.bash_profile` - it will resolve to full path before adding. What's the danger in your opinion? <comment299908> No danger, it works fine. It's developing good habits. At some point you will run into the shell's word splitting feature. So, always quote strings that contain spaces. As an example try- `printf '%s\n' foo bar` then add quotes around `foo bar`. <comment299909> But you can't proclaim a universal rule "you should". If I wanted expanded path to be added to `.bash_profile` I can't use quotes. <comment299937> @Mark even `~/.bash_profile` is giving **No such file or directory**. <comment299938> Why a **negative vote** for the question BTW? <comment299939> Not me but possibly because of a lack of research there are a lot of questions re .profile
