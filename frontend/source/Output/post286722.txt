Iphone 6 - how do i know if someone has removed data from it <body> i just found out that my girlfriend has just had her phone repaired and gave the guy her pass code. I know, i know that was stupid. I didn't know that she had done this.  I suspect that the shop would have crawled the phone for photos, messages, valuable data.  Is there anyway of knowing if someone has done this? I figured maybe if it was hooked up to a computer then it would be added to a trusted computer list.  Or, maybe the phone logs certain activity for debugging faults.  Anyone have any suggestions of checking if someone has been poking around the phone? Thanks.
