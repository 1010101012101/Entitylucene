IOS 7 for non developers <body> Can people without an Apple developers account try the beta versions of iOS 7?  <answer94626> Anyone can run the beta, provided they're a member of Apple's iOS developer program, which costs $99/year to join.  <answer99200> No, participation in the iOS 7 beta is limited those with Apple iOS developer accounts. Keep in mind that signing up for the account and using the beta subjects you to a non-disclosure agreement that limits your ability to discuss the beta.  <answer99203> Yes, it is possible - but I will not go into how.  $99 a year is not that expensive, so it is foolish to "cheat"  <answer99212> The official version of iOS 7 is not released yet. Only when you have a developer's ID ($99/yr) can you install the beta version of iOS 7.   Though you can download the leaked developer's version online and install it on a jailbroken device, it is not recommended and is illegal.   <answer99217> As a lot of folks mentioned, you can after paying the 100 bucks developer account.  But i do not recommend it, it's really not for primary devices and/or consumer usage.  You wouldn't be satisfied with the user experience, it's really not finished yet.  <comment110944> Edited this Q&A to be one question rather than two. <comment116622> The question explicitly asks about people without developer accounts. <comment116628> I'm sure there are others (tech journalists, for instance) who get to see iOS 7 before it goes live, but under their own NDA. In any event, you're right that the general public can't just download a beta. <comment116633> I don't the question is asking for warez sites (and if it is, it's not a question that's welcome here). There is plenty of software that *can* be legitimately tried in beta form by people who aren't registered developers. The OP is asking if there is a way to do this with iOS 7. <comment116636> It is possible to install iOS 7 without a personal developer account - the *. Ipsw file you can get from a registered developer, where you can choose to register the iPhones/iPads UUID or not, because it is not necessary - but how to install/upgrade without a developer account, I'll not go into, because I don't like it, and I'm not allowed to do it. But it doesn't change the fact that it is possible. <comment116669> The device doesn't need to be jailbroken to installe a version of iOS 7 - sadly but true.
