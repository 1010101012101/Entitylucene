waking up from locked screen with just keyboard <body> I'm on OS X 10.9.5. I do not like using mouse/trackpad, and mostly work with keyboard only. One annoying thing is that when the OS is locked (screen lock) and the power saving for the monitor is activated, I can't wake it up with a keystroke. I MUST move the mouse cursor to let me type in my password to unlock the screen.  Does anybody else have the same problem and if so is there a workaround?  <answer155262> On 10.9.5 You could use the Accessibility option and enable mouse keys  if you have a keyboard number pad.  There are some optional settings there to choose from like:  By clicking 5 times on the Option key you can turn that feature on or off.  <comment182596> Is your keyboard connected over USB or Bluetooth? <comment182598> @grgarside USB keyboard (HHK light) <comment182606> Space Bar wakes mine up. Mouse used to, before 10.9 but no longer. <comment182617> I have a worse problem on Yosemiteâ€¦ I have to *click* to get it to work.
