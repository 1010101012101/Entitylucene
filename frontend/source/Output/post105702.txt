Must there be notification alerts for anything to appear on lock screen? <body> I disabled Instagram from posting a notification alert ( banner or alert ).  However any posted item or notification do not show in the lock screen or notification center.   Prior to ios7 this causes no problem, as comments/notifications from such an app show up in the lock screen or notification center, but is this feature disabled now ?  <answer105732> How did you disable the notification alerts?  You should have three different settings in the notification settings:  ul liAlert Style: if you set this to none, you will not see any banners or alerts when you have your phone unlocked./li liShow in Notification Center: you should keep this on/li liShow on Lock Screen: and this one on/li /ul  Those settings should be independent to each other I believe.  <answer106919> Turns out that Yes, I need to have some sort of alert (banner or alert window) for anything to show on the lock screen. Kind of sucks since iOS 5 didn't need such a thing.  <comment124369> I chose the first option, as in "None", hence disabling notification alerts .....
