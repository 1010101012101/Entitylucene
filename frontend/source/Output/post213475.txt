iTerm2 output broken since upgrade to El Capitan <body> Since I upgraded my OS X to El Capitan (10.11) the output of iTerm2 is completely messed up. See this example screenshot (iTerm2 on the left, Terminal.app on the right):  h3Update/h3  I'm using iTerm 2.1.4 which should be the latest version.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Lq4B9.png" alt="Left side is iTerm2, right side is Terminal.app".  The problem is independent from tmux, I just started it to show it's broken output.  I tried to play with codeTERM/code but without any luck. How to fix this?  <answer213483> I found the setting that was causing the problem. I don't know why but its the "Treat ambiguous width-characters as double-width". See screenshot: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GLffM.png" alt="enter image description here" Disabling the setting makes the terminal work normal.  I'm using DejaVu Monospace for Powerline which might contain those ambiguous width character and I guess that the output of codedoge/code also contains those chars. So anyone using those should disable the setting.  <comment257708> Could you specify iterm2 version. Also, did you try with fresh preference settings (after saving old preference settings somewhere)? <comment257713> @sdayal I *thought* that fresh settings had helped, but when I reapplied my settings (not by copying the back but by actual setting them) it came back.. Have to investigate which setting is causing it
