iPhone 4S Auto-Correct <body> Is there any way that I can get auto-correct on my iPhone 4S to stop changing the word "strongYo/strong" to "strongTo/strong?" I have tried adding a keyboard shortcut for "Yo" as well as adding Spanish to my International Keyboards, but its still happening.  <answer52597> Unfortunately, Apple hasn't relegated any control of auto-correct functions to the user (natively), and it isn't possible to add or remove words that it auto-corrects - other then using the shortcuts like you mentioned, which don't work for everything.   <comment60220> Well, that's just annoying.   *...Angrily shakes a fist...*
