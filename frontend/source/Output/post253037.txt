How can I reinstall iWork applications after I removed them from my Mac? <body> If I were to say, remove Pages from my Mac, would I be able to reinstall it later from the Mac App Store?  <comment314896> Sure, why not?  What OS do you have and where did you get Pages (preinstalled, downloaded from MAS, etc)? <comment314897> I originally got it as part of iWork '09 and the license has since been transferred to MAS. I have OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.6 (15G1004) <comment314961> If Pages etc. is part of the applications listed in the "Purchases Apps" category in the store you should be able to redownload it.
