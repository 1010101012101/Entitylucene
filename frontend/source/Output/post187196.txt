Enable spell check for various languages in Chrome <body> I use Yosemite with Chrome version 42.0.2311.135 (64-bit). When writing in a text area the spell checker correctly detects English and French, but does not detect Spanish, and so it marks as wrong correctly written Spanish words:  img src="https://monosnap.com/image/TqkroiuE0gaMjqev8hoCcV0q1re3nY.png" alt="img"  I don't know why it happens. English, French and Spanish are set in Chrome:  img src="https://monosnap.com/image/OP7Edeq5FMwcjnsHLItrVgIDMVLG1u.png" alt="img"  and also in the Mac preferences:  img src="https://monosnap.com/image/qFVTIgvKwyDSCQdlv4jqVBmZDxC9hu.png" alt="img"  Is there any setting to have Chrome/MacOS detect Spanish like it does for French and English?  <answer187317> I do not use Chrome (often) and Firefox is my favorite browser.  So I added Spanish to the Spell check and if I right click and select it it works just fine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jHhZV.jpg" alt="Spanish"  One drawback is it applies to the whole text so I can not spell check just a single word.  strongIf you want to do that in Chrome:/strong  Under the Edit tab select the Spelling and Grammar- Show   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zW0uh.jpg" alt="spelling"  Now select Spanish  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8C07Q.jpg" alt="Spanish"  <answer187326> The place where you set spell check is System Preferences/Keyboard/Text/Spelling.  Go to the Setup item there and check the boxes for all three languages you want, and then set it to Automatic.  Automatic doesn't always work perfectly, however.  Below is the result I get with just boxes for English, French, and Spanish checked and set to Automatic.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dlP0z.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment221219> It must be the Chrome, since it works purfectly in FireFox "Que tal usted" <comment221316> Just tested in Firefox, I have the exact same issue. <comment221337> hmmm... if you right click on the misspelled word and select the Spanish it works or not ? <comment221353> OS X Language and region settings don't have anything to do with spellcheck as far as I know. Nor do Chrome's Language settings. <comment221377> He asked for Chrome, not Firefox <comment221419> Tom where is the Spelling you mentioned? I don't see it in System Preferences/Keyboard (http://monosnap.com/image/aiOtsmB25Tn51osTzGddaVnUCfuNwK) and no way to check boxes for languages. <comment221421> Buscar: on Firefox it works now that I have installed the Spanish dictionary. <comment221423> Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you need to install it, but it is simple to do. So are you happy :) if yes mark my answer as done. <comment221437> Actually I need to have it working on Chrome, not on Firefox. <comment221442> I recommend you delete the irrelevant Firefox stuff in your answer to a question about Chrome. <comment221446> It still does not work, I have several languages selected (http://monosnap.com/image/zQf8MUqBQ1bqmh3KC3S3914adOaVMg, http://monosnap.com/image/Ly2ziRmEYLt3xjrI9YzHx7a49YcJAV) and Spanish is still not detected, Spanish words are still underlined in red. Thanks for you help Tom. <comment221448> See my updated answer <comment221642> thanks, I've unchecked all but English, French and Spanish and still have the same issue. <comment221718> @Florent2  Strange that it works for me but not for you.  I notice your Chrome is not up to date (should be 152 at the end), but doubt that matters. <comment350839> This should be the correct answer. Apparently Chrome more or less uses the built-in spellchecking of MacOS, and you'll have to set it to automatic so it works for all languages.
