Get List of Purchased Items on App Store <body> Is there a way of downloading a list of all purchases from the Mac App Store?  I know I can see them, and I know I can get a list of apps currently on my system, but I would like to have a list of all purchases ever made.  <answer271362> If you login to the app store and click the Purchased icon this will show all apps purchased with the ID you are signed in with. This will include currently installed as well as previously installed.  img src="https://s23.postimg.org/9ftf2yzbf/Screen_Shot_2017_02_02_at_09_14_52.png" alt="Screenshit"  Don't think you can download it though
