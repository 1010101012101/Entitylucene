Can I replace optical drive with 2nd hard disk on MacBook? <body> I have a unibody MacBook, late 2008 I think. The optical drive failed and I wondered about adding a second hard disk. Is this simple to do?  <answer77667> I have heard good things about the Optibay kit. It provides a mounting bracket for whatever hard drive or SSD you want to put in there.  This video shows how to install it in a Mid-2010 MBP, which is close in design to the Unibody MacBook you have. Instructions according to the guy in the video:  ol liRemove the bottom panel/li liDisconnect and remove the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth antenna./li liDisconnect optical drive and put the connector onto the Optibay/li liPut your hard drive into the optibay/li liFollow the steps in reverse to reassemble your computer./li /ol  The dangerous parts are when you pop up the delicate connectors with, say, an iPod opening tool. So the Wi-Fi may not work afterwards, and you would be on your own since Apple doesn't support modifications. But overall, it isn't so bad. It looks like an easy fix.  <answer79052> Yes, I've done it with OWC's Data Doubler and it worked extremely well.

I don't think you can do it without buying a case for the drive. The one they use in the video only works for a SATA optical drives, check to see if your computer is compatible.
