How do I prevent Terminal.app from capturing Cmd/Ctrl/L? <body> Following the instructions at http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/apple-in-the-enterprise/handy-screen-locking-tips-for-mac/ I've set up a keyboard shortcut to lock my screen by hitting kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd L /kbd . It works when the active window is Finder, or Notes, or Thunderbird, or ... well, most stuff.  There are a few applications where it doesn't though, Terminal being the most annoying. Terminal seems to capture it and treat it as ... well, I'm not sure what. It's not treating it the same as kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd L /kbd, or the same as kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd L /kbd.  It also happens in Chrome, although only on some pages - this 'ere page being one of them.  It worked just fine before I upgraded to El Capitan.  Any suggestions for how to fix this?  <answer244983> The trick, really, is to avoid common key-commands - which is why the article you refer to uses kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd L /kbd, as no OS X command would normally use only kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd &amp; kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd - they would always add kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd too, leaving you free to use kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd for anything you like.  If you insist on using kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd L /kbd then you would have to add, emfor each application that already uses it/em, a new custom command so it will no longer trigger in preference to your own.  For example, for Terminal, where kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd L /kbd is Clear Screen  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RQoVA.png" alt="enter image description here"  you would need to replace that in System Prefs  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YBNdc.png" alt="enter image description here"  and add a different, non-conflicting shortcut.  <comment302280> If I change it to Ctrl-Opt-L then it seems to work even less. It doesn't work in Terminal, or System Preferences, or Thunderbird, or Finder.
