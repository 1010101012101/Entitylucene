Terminal 3 failed password attempts <body> I've got a really funny issue with my Mac at the moment. I was using a sudo command and it rejected my password 3 times (I double checked and the password was correct) but now I can't do anything as it keeps printing 7~7~7~ whenever I try to type a command. I've tried control + c and it won't stop it.  Has anyone experienced this before?
