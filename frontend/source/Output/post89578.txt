Finder does not open <body> Clicking on the finder icon in the dock has no effect. To open the finder I have to open the context menu and choose "New Window".  I already stoped the finder process, without success.  How can I fix that?  <answer89587> Have you tried simply clicking on the Finder icon in the dock ?  That always works for me.  I would delete my Finder .plist  I would also "zap my PRAM"  <comment105186> what is not showing, the side bar or nothing. <comment105189> Nothing. I have to go via the context menu every time. <comment105201> Have you checked output in the console.app ? <comment105206> @maseth Check for what? <comment105213> Please reread the first sentence of the question :-) also it would help to know where the finder.plist is stored and how zapping a PRAM works. <comment105214> Thank you for your effort, please read the question first.
