Frequent Locations - Calendar view <body> I often use the frequent location feature in my iPhone to remind me where I was on a given day. But the data is grouped by location so I have to hunt to determine where I was on any given day.   Is there a way to view this data in calendar or date form? Via a 3rd party app perhaps?  <comment345246> You can with Google Maps on Android, but you can't with the Frequent Locations feature (apps can't access that, for obvious reasons). You could try downloading an app that keeps track of your location for you!
