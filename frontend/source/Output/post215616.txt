"Recent Items" menu item disappears from Apple menu <body> h1Disappearing "Recent Items" menu item/h1  Since upgrading to El Capitan 10.11.1, the "Recent Items" menu item from the Apple menu disappears. Even during a work session, sometimes "Recent Items" is there when I need it, sometimes it disappears altogether.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qyJVu.png" alt="enter image description here"   h1Multiple Items on Submenu/h1  Furthermore, when the menu does mysteriously return it has multiple items repeating in the list of the "Recent Items" submenu.  Is this a common El Capitan bug? Should I have done a clean install instead of an upgrade? Any way to fix either problem, the disappearing menu item or the multiple submenu items?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MPoWq.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer215760> The recent items thing is working fine for me. I just you wanted to confirm wether you have updated your system to Mac OS X 10.11.1. If not I advice you to do it immidiately, because it has a lot of bugs fixed. But in a case where you have already updated but still problem persists, what you can do is clear all cache resources related to your system and not your your application. I hope this works :-)  <answer218537> h1Rebuild codeLaunchServices/code Library/h1  From this discussion board I learned to "rebuild the LaunchServices library". I do not understand the details, but this one line executed in Terminal.app does the trick:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user /code/pre  Then restart your Mac. Relaunching the Finder is not enough, you must restart your Mac to get back your Recent Items menu.  strongGood news:/strong It works.  strongBad news:/strong The effect is temporary. Eventually (days, weeks) your Recent Items menu will either disappear or develop duplicates.  Because this is only a partial workaround, and not a true fix, I will not mark this Answer (my own) as Accepted. Hopefully someone else might post a real fix.  I suspect, but have not proven, that the real solution is a clean-install. I took some bad advice and upgraded in-place to Mavericks and El Capitan. Next time I do a major upgrade I will go back to the tried-and-true method of a clean install.  <answer284109> go to System Preferences  General, the Recent Items usually resets to None.  <comment260652> Yes, using 10.11.1. Updated Question. Perhaps you can explain more about "clear all cache resources related to your system and not your application". <comment260679> I meant you to clear system cache. I told you not to clear your application cache because for example: When you clear your application cache like chrome, you might ending up clearing all your cookies and some of the old pulgins and even history. So you will lose all those data. Same case in other applications also. So I need you to only clear system cache i.e something like logs, reports and stuff. Just give it a try I feel that this will resolve your issue. <comment260842> Also being discussed here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/211471/recent-items-menus-have-stopped-working-on-my-imac <comment265447> I did a clean install of El Capitan, and I have the exact same problem. I would love to have a solution. <comment341541> Update: Seems like this bug has been fixed by updates subsequently issued by Apple. <comment358275> Welcome to Ask Different.
