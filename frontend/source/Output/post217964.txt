How to change the "Recovery HD" partition to type "Apple_Boot"? <body> Typing in the terminal codediskutil list/code gives me this...  precode/dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *500.1 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            499.1 GB   disk0s2    3:                  Apple_HFS Recovery HD             629.1 MB   disk0s3 /code/pre  I try to change codedisk0s3/code to type "Apple_Boot", by using...  precodesudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk0s3 -settype "Apple_Boot" /code/pre  But I keep getting the error...  precodeasr: Volume adjustment failed: Operation not permitted /code/pre  hr  The partition isn't mounted. I have also tried the command as superuser.  <answer236033> At first:  precodeumount -f "/Volumes/Recovery HD" /code/pre  Then:  precodesudo asr adjust --target /dev/disk0s3 -settype "Apple_Boot" /code/pre  <answer296291> It seems that normal "umount" command is not suitable here, especially if Recovery partition is on system hard disk (SSD/HDD). I found working script on JAMFNation for that:  precode#!/bin/sh  RecoveryHDName="Recovery HD" RecoveryHDID=/usr/sbin/diskutil list | grep "$RecoveryHDName" | awk 'END \{ print $NF }'\  /usr/sbin/diskutil unmount /dev/"$RecoveryHDID" /usr/sbin/asr adjust -target /dev/"$RecoveryHDID" -settype Apple_Boot /usr/sbin/diskutil info /dev/"$RecoveryHDID"* /code/pre  The key is that you need to eject only this particular partition (you can to this from Finder also!) and only then execute: codesudo asr adjust --target /dev/diskNsM -settype "Apple_Boot"/code where you should replace N and M with your Disk and Partition number.  Apple Recovery partition is used as emergency tool. In case you cannot boot to your system, you at least can try to do repairs.   To access Recovery partition, reboot your Mac and press and hold Cmd+R during startup/power on.   <comment263462> Is `adjust` an new _verb_ in the version of `asr` that ships with OS X 10.11, as it is not one in OS X 10.10 and earlier? <comment263494> What are you doing this? What's the goal? <comment263557> @Kh√ºrtWilliams, Crimbo is probably trying to do it because it's supposed to show as: `Apple_Boot Recovery HD` **not** `Apple_HFS Recovery HD` <comment374218> umount gives: umount: /Volumes/Recovery HD: not currently mounted, thus asr still not able to execute.
