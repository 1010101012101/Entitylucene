Can't send SMS to a number before they SMS me! <body> My iPhone 5c won't send SMS.  The weird thing is the problem is fixed for a specific contact when they send me an SMS. Once they have sent an SMS to me, it's like the connection to them is 'unblocked' or something. However the problem persists with other contacts until they each send me an SMS.  I got the phone from a friend about a week ago and it had been factory reset. I installed a backup from my old iPhone 4 (which was on O2), i started using it with an EE sim card and had this problem. I have now even switched back to a different O2 sim card but still have the same problem.  Could it be to do with installing a backup from a different phone?  I have seen answers suggesting "have a contact send you an SMS and then see if you can send one back" but i haven't seen anyone explain why this happens.
