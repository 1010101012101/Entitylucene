Mount Shared Drive via AFP in Terminal <body> I want to mount an external drive, connected on computer A, to computer B.  I am able to access and mount the drive by connecting to the server through Finder (Command-K), but how can I do this exact action through the terminal? I've been using several formats of codemount/code and codemount_afp/code but nothing seems to work. Something along the lines of:  precodemount_afp -i afp://user:pass@ipaddress/Volumes/SharedDrive /Volumes/Shared /code/pre  In Finder, I just type the IP of the Mac connected to the drive, input credentials, and mount the selected drive...but it's not working by simply entering the codeafp://ipaddress/code, just like the 'Connect Server' command through Finder, in the terminal.  How do I do the same connection with a bash command? The end result will be the mounted drive on B.  <answer107732> Try:  precodesudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/user /Volumes/Shared /code/pre  <answer121500> A couple of things you need to be aware of.  First - the AFP URL needs to contain the name of the share - not it's location on the server. Second, the mount point must be an empty directory that you have write permission to. So your commands might be :-  precodesudo mkdir /Volumes/mount sudo mount -t afp afp://user:pass@ipaddress/SharedDrive /Volumes/mount /code/pre  <comment125848> Which error messages are you getting?
