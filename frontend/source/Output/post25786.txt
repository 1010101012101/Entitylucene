Editing Hosts File to Redirect URL to different IP Address <body> When I edit my hosts file to redirect a URL to a specific IP address, nothing happens.  My hosts file looks like this - code199.204.138.195 zionica.com/code this is in the directory code/private/etc/hosts/code.  I am not all that familiar with the Terminal nor it's commands so I'm having difficulty troubleshooting my problem.  The one thing I can think of is that I followed the following tutorial in an attempt to have SwitchHosts work in Firefox. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchhosts/reviews/286862/  Is there a way to reverse these steps?  Would that even solve my problem?  <answer25788> Try running  dscacheutil -flushcache as it sounds like it's not correctly doing flushing the cache to update it.  <answer25803> Note that zionica.com and www.zionica.com (or any other subdomain that comes before the word zionica) is a different domain, and the line as listed will not trap everything automatically by listing only the Second Level Domain.  www.zionica.com  codewww/code is a third-level domain, more commonly referred to as a 'sub-domain'.br codezionica/code is the second-level domain. This word/placement on it's own generally does not have a more specific name.br codecom/code is a Top-Level Domain (TLD). Just like co, cc, org, net, ca, jp, uk, me, info, etc. (Everything except etc is a TLD.)  You can stuff multiple names into a single IP address line, so this is valid:  code199.204.138.195 zionica.com www.zionica.com/code  <comment29282> Thank you for your response!  I've actually tried running that command numerous times but with no results. <comment29286> Ah, thought we might get lucky and find that it was a simple one. So if you've run switchhosts your hosts file now exists outside of /etc (kind of). The ln command creates a symbolic link between the files so /etc/hosts points to username/hosts.   OS X reads /etc/hosts first and it's normally a symlink to /etc/private/hosts, so editing /etc/private/hosts won't update /etc/hosts. You can either edit the hosts file in username, or /etc/hosts and that should do it. <comment29323> Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, it didn't end up solving my problem - but it was very helpful info! I wouldn't pass up the opportunity to learn something! <comment29327> Ok, so I tried editing the hosts file in username by typing the command `nano hosts` from within my username directory.  I also tried editing the one in the 'etc' directory by typing `nano /etc/hosts` from within my username directory. Both files now have `199.204.138.195 zionica.com www.zionica.com` in them. It still doesn't work - the page points to the original IP address; not the one defined in my hosts file. <comment29350> Try deleting the hosts files found at username/ and /etc, then cp the /etc/private one over into /etc with sudo. It'll break that SwitchHosts thing, but might resolve your issue. <comment29668> That did it!  Thank you so much!
