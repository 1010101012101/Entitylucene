installing osx with usb superdrive on a blanck new hard drive <body> I have a MacBook Pro mid 2010 with a black hard drive on which I have to install OS X but my optical drive won't work so I'm trying to use a sub SuperDrive which isn't being recognized  <answer244094> Seems like SuperDrive is not compatible with any MacBook Pro that already have built-in optical drive. See here for statement from Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202665  However there seems to be a way to override this according to this blog entry: http://www.hardturm.ch/luz/2011/10/how-to-make-the-macbook-air-superdrive-work-with-any-mac/ Might be a bit complicated though.
