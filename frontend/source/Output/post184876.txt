SSH private key password never removed with Keychain/ssh-agent <body> I have an SSH private key with password, and I'm able to add it to KeyChain/ssh-agent and have the password automatically used without having to enter it. Now I'd like to add one more thing: I want keychain/ssh-agent to emforget/em (or lock) the password after a certain time elapsed or the screen is locked.  What I'm experiencing (on Mac OS X 10.9.5), is that even if I set my "login" keychain to "lock after sleep", and I wake up the laptop from sleep, and the keychain is still locked, ssh (through ssh-agent?) is still  able to retrieve the password without asking me to unlock the keychain.  Note that the password is added to the keychain 'automatically' when I run codessh/code the first time - I'm not typing codessh-add/code on the command line, thus I prefer to not use codessh-add -t TIMEOUT/code explicitly.   Is there anyway to make it forget/lock the password?  <answer184884> Not sure if you have this settings.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ezY8p.jpg" alt="keychain"  Check the Keep login keychain unlocked to off, in keychain preferences - First Aid tab.  <comment219307> Where are these settings?
