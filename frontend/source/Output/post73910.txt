Transferring m4v files using new iTunes <body> Since the new version of iTunes I can't figure out how to sync my Teaching Co. lectures (m4v) that I'd downloaded onto my computer.  They seem to copy to the iTunes on my iMac, but they do not sync to my iPad.  They are video files, which I used to be able to watch under the "Movies" app on my iPad, but they do not appear there or anywhere, despite syncing.  Also--I'd like to restore the sidebar navigation capability. Is that possible, and if so , how?  Help!  Thanks, GRaysman  <comment85878> To get back the sidebar, View  Show Sidebar.
