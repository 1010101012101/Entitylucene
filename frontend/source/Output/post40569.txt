How to update Java JRE in Lion? <body> Sofware update says everything is up to date, however Java Preferences says it's running Version 6 Update 29.  The Java website says there is a newer version: Version 6 Update 31 with critical security fixes.  Is there any way I can update this or do I have to sit around and wait for Apple to release this through software update?  It is a critical security fix isn't it?  Thanks! :)  <answer40619> From Oracle Java downloads:     Apple supplies their own version of Java. Use the Software Update   feature (available on the Apple menu) to check that you have the most   up-to-date version of Java for your Mac.   I seriously recommend not to use any other way, but OS X Software Update.  <comment45970> That kind of sucks, Apple doesn't seem the least bit concerned about releasing Java updates :( <comment54447> I'm picking this answer as there's really no other reliable way to go about this.  That said, they did just update today, horray! :) <comment57238> [Java 1.7u4](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) is now available directly from Oracle.
