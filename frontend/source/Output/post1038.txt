Is there a way to make my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard hibernate with a keyboard shortcut? <body> Is there a way to hibernate at all? I know if the battery dies when it's sleeping it hibernates, but is there a way to go directly to hibernate with a keyboard shortcut?  <answer1039> Option-Command-Eject is the system-standard key to put the machine to sleep.  If you want to do more than sleep, you can use this preference pane to fine-tune the sleep or hibernate behavior: http://www.jinx.de/SmartSleep.html  Edit:  More information about sleep, hibernate, and more on the Mac: http://www.geekguides.co.uk/104/how-to-enable-hibernate-mode-on-a-mac/  <comment843> possible duplicate: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/377/can-macs-be-put-in-hibernation-voluntarily <comment1044> @calavera It's definitely related, though the answer to that question was not a keyboard shortcut, so I'm inclined to keep this question open.
