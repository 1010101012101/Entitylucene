How can I visit an IP address on Mobile Safari? <body> I am on iOS 7.0.4 on an iPhone 5. I type in a IP address on my local network, code192.168.11.18/code, in my Safari address bar, and Safari completely ignores the fact that it is a host I am wanting to visit. Instead, it searches for codewww.192.168.11.18/code in my ISP's search engine.  How can I force Safari to visit the host I am requesting and not assume it's a search term?  <answer126025> include codehttp:///code  i.e.: codehttp://192.168.11.18/code  (Tested this and it works perfectly)  <answer216709> I solved mine by connecting via another network. Probably it's a server issue. I tried  precode192.168.8.1 /code/pre  and  precodehttp://192.168.8.1 /code/pre  At first non of the url pattern worked for me but both seems to work now.  <comment147554> Both `http://` and `http:\\ ` still didn't work. <comment147555> sorry it should be `http://192.168.11.18` (my slashes were backwards) also you need to include the ip address after the `http://` <comment147560> I ran into this too. `http://192.168.11.18` should definitely work. Double check the ip address though. If the server you are trying to reach doesn't respond (because it is at a different address or on a port other than 80) it will go back and try adding www to the front. <comment147563> Okay, maybe the problem lies somewhere else in my network. The request must not have reached the server correctly. Thanks! <comment359099> I'm having a similar problem here and am wondering how you solved yours? Thanks! https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/284762/53510 <comment359147> I'm not sure what my issue was specifically, because it could've been quite a variety of issues. I think my issues probably stemmed from me not completely understanding how my particular local server was working. I'll hop over to your question and see if I can help.
