How can I make this Apple Script shorter? (quitting multiple apps via tell) <body> I want to edit a part of an Apple Script to quit various applications at once:  precodetell application "TweetDeck"     quit end tell tell application "Google Chrome"     quit end tell /code/pre  Over all there are seven entries just like above.  Is there any way to write this more compact?  <answer69464> Unfortunately you cannot pass multiple applications to the 'tell application' call.  Rather, you could use a unix utility that can terminate multiple applications at once - killall.  You can invoke this utility from within an AppleScript:  codedo shell script "killall firefox Mail"/code - This would terminate FireFox and Mail  emstrong'killall' is case sensitive/em/strong, so you must first determine the process names of the applications that you wish to kill.   ul liLaunch the applications that you will want to be terminating with the script/li liUse the following command (in a Terminal window) to find their full and correct names. (In this example, we are looking to find out strongtweetdeck's/strong correct process name)./li /ul  codeps x | grep -i tweetdeck | grep -v grep/code  With TweetDeck running, this will give output similar to the following:  code59127   ??  S      0:01.23 /Applications/TweetDeck.app/Contents/MacOS/TweetDeck -psn_0_21423213/code  The last part of the path is the process name as it should be passed to 'killall'. In this case TweetDeck (...Contents/MacOS/strongTweetDeck/strong).  So, we go back to our AppleScript and add TweetDeck to the string of applications that we are terminating. In addition to my previous example, I'd do:  codedo shell script "killall firefox Mail TweetDeck"/code  Hope this helps!  <answer69466> precodetell application "TweetDeck" to quit tell application "Google Chrome" to quit /code/pre  tell-end-tell blocks with only one command can be written in one line.  <answer69476> You can use a list of apps and a loop. Just add new apps to that first list and they'll be quit automatically.  precodeset apps to {"Google Chrome", "Tweetbot", "ForkLift"} repeat with thisApp in apps     tell application thisApp to quit end repeat /code/pre  <comment80713> Thanks for this detailed answer! I guess this trick could work just fine. Then I could also use a stronger command to make sure that applications are quit. <comment80714> killall is such a command. So far in my testing it terminates and "takes no prisoners". You could also look into using kill -9 instead of killall. <comment80717> Yay, this is very much what I wanted to have!
