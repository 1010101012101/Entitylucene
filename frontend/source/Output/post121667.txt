Turning Off Keyboard's lights while in Bootcamp's Windows 8 <body> When I start Win8 (installed with bootcamp) the keyboard lights are strongalways/strong on. How do I strongdisable/strong this?  Is there a possible way to never ever let them turn on again? (Besides opening the hardware and cutting off the wires).   I have looked in power settings but didn't found anything helpful.   <answer121668> I don't believe there's a way to do this without 3suprd/sup-party software such as strongPower Plan 7/strong.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/bootcamp.html/li /ul  <answer161957> The best way I found is to go into the power plan settings and go into advanced settings then under display disable adaptive brightness.  <comment141837> Try holding F5 to dim totally. <comment141841> Try reinstalling the WindowsSupport files (which reinstalls the keyboard driver) <comment189227> Is it possible to alter the SMC manually? That could possibly do the trick. <comment189228> This doesn't affect the keyboard backlight? <comment189229> @ElRojito I'm not aware of any way to do that.
