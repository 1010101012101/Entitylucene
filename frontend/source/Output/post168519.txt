Why iPad Music app says "No Content" and I cannot download music to it <body> Firstly, I have been using iPad for a few days and this things may be very nooby for you. But funny, I cannot find similar info on Apple forum.   Namely, look at this image. This is how my Music app looks like when I open it.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TesTC.png" alt=""  I was offered to download iTunes U app, which I did, but I cannot seem to find music in it, only video lectures. Next I tried going to AppStore app to Music section, but there I found only apps.   Is this app maybe limited to some countries so I cannot use it? If not, what noobish mistake I have been doing?  EDIT  There is iTunes Store app on my iPad but it looks weird. all I have is a link to use iTunes U. Check it  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5wjHn.jpg" alt=""  I searched for the term "music" but it lists podcasts from iTunes U app only.   <answer168526> The iTunes Store is separate from the App Store - it should have its own icon  this is from an iPhone but they should look similarâ€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3MSsW.png" alt="enter image description here"  As you discovered, iTunesU is for education - see https://www.apple.com/education/ipad/itunes-u/  <comment197812> Thanks. I have that app indeed, but acts weird as well. Check my edit. <comment197813> Your app Music I see on the snapshots have music inside? <comment197815> yes, but only because I put music in there ;) Forget iTunesU, that's for other things entirely, only the pink/purple iTunes Store is what you need to get music <comment197819> Yes, but when I open it I see the screen as in the 2nd image I attached. Check my edit. Is this weird?
