For some reason I can't open files on drive <body> I can't open the files on certain drive that is formatted as ntfs. I have Tuxera installed however. Here is an image on how they look:  The file with a lock is password protected as it should.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A9Ixn.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any suggestions on how to fix this? For some reason the files I can't open are somehow transparent.  <answer27869> First thing, make sure that it's no locked and that you have the correct permissions : img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MIt69.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you have extended attributes you can get rid of those by doing the following :  1- Do codels -l@/code, under the file it will give you something like "com.apple.FinderInfo". Copy that 2- Do codexattr -d com.apple.FinderInfo path/to/file/code  If nothing works then your last option is to sudo it : codesudo open path/to/file/code  Also see if you can open it using a mac that those not have Tuxera installed on it.  <comment31756> What are the permissions of the file you are trying to access. Do a Get Info on the file. <comment31761> I can read and write.... I should be able to access them... :( <comment31773> What are the permissions on the file if you do, in Termiinal, ls -ls ? <comment31787> These: -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 JLD  staff  983217 Sep 18 13:48 NoPassLibro.pdf What do you think? <comment31804> Your problem is the '@'. This means that you have extended attributes set on the file. Do a ls -l@ to see what extended attribute it is <comment31837> this is it: -rwxrwxrwx@ 1 JLD  staff  983217 Sep 18 13:48 NoPassLibro.pdf  com.apple.FinderInfo     32 <comment31990> Thanks a lot. A `xattr -dr com.apple.FinderInfo nameOfTheDrive` did the trick.
