Which key is denoted by a ^ on a Macbook? <body> I have switched to Mac recently from Windows so I apologise if this question seems silly to experienced users. In various keyboard shortcuts, the code^/code key is mentioned. Which key are we talking about here?  <answer273675> This is kbd^ CTRL/kbd key (or kbdControl/kbd on some keyboards).   Here'e more info on Apple website.     Mac menus and keyboards often use symbols for certain keys, including the modifier keys:      ul   liCommand ⌘/li   liShift ⇧/li   liOption ⌥/li   liControl ⌃/li   liCaps Lock ⇪/li   liFn/li   /ul
