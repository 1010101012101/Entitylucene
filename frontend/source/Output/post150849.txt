Pinyin input placed behind Hangouts window <body> Usually when I type Pinyin input, the suggestions appear over the window like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OXMms.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, when using Google Hangouts, they appear behind which makes it somewhat useless:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/PbDss0z.gif" alt="Pinyin input in Google Hangouts"  How can I make it so that they appear in front of the window as normal?  <answer151804> Google Hangouts windows are set to Always On Top, however they are strongnot standard OS X windows/strong and do not conform to the standards set by OS X. This means that they can be on top of any system window or dialog, including the Pinyin input windows.  There does not appear to be a fix for this at this time as it is the developer's discretion to fix their implementation of Always On Top as it is non-standard.  <answer179325> You can disable the on top feature of that window.
