My MacBook Pro cannot connect to the Internet <body> I last had my computer connected 3 days ago to a wireless network (the one I am still on with other computers). AirPort says it's connected and has a strong green light (full bars in wifi) but when I open System Preferences, the 902.1X: WPA: says FreeWiFi_Secure and the button says Connect, so I press that and under that it says "Authentication server is not responding" and has the waiting signal (spinning flower thing).  The wifi works as I am on it on my phone and no one else is having trouble in the house.  Can someone please help this damsel in distress!  <comment117911> What are your DNS settings? <comment117917> If you hold the option key and select the Wireless icon in the menu bar, is there a **Open Wireless Diagnostics** and/or **Open Network Diagnostics** tool that you could run to narrow down where the failure is. If not, you might want to edit in your OS X software version so someone could point you to an appropriate troubleshooting guide for your OS. <comment118165> I don't know what the DNS settings are.
