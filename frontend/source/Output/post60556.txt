Mac Mountain Lion OS X 10.8 - Unable to connect to shared folders on Windows PC's on network <body> I cannot successfully connect to any of the shared windows folders on any of the network-connected PC's since the installation of OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.  <comment69717> Do you get an error? Any message? Some more information would be good, to be able to help you. <comment69721> There was a problem connecting to the "PCName". <comment69722> Check the server name or IP address, and then try again. If you continue to have problems, contact your system administrator. <comment69729> All other PC's connect easily, and I have always connected from 2 Mac's to the shared folders, but since I have installed OS X 10.8 I get the error stated above on both the Mac's <comment69740> Have you tried to connect with Samba to the PC? `cmd + k` in Finder and then `smb://PCName` <comment70041> Yes, I have tried it, and even then it requires me to connect as a Guest or a Registered User - neither of these two options work. I've even tried to change the settings on the Windows PC's to allow sharing, but to no avail. <comment70248> Have you tried connecting to the PC using the IP rather than the hostname? <comment70981> Yes, indeed, I have tried the IP address rather than the hostname, I've tried SMB, I've tried everything! - yet I cannot connect to any shared Windows PC on the network.
