How to disable MacBook Air display when using monitors <body> I'm running OS X 10.12.5 and I have a dual monitor set up at work. I can successfully use both monitors while the laptop is closed but i would like to be able to shut off or remove the MacBook screen while the lid is closed. (I.E I don't want to be able to drag things onto the closed laptop screen, I want it to be ignored like its not even there)  Any possible way of achieving this?  <comment361756> Do you mean "remove the MacBook screen while the lid is *open*"?  If the lid is closed (clamshell mode) you shouldn't be able to drag anything to it. <comment361771> the lid is closed and even the apple symbol on the back of the lid is not on as if its asleep, however i can still drag my mouse and items over to the the MacBook screen. Ive tried some tricks that other people here have suggested in other forums such as closing the lid first THEN plugging in displays but no such luck.
