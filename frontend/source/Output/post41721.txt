How to change bash version with homebrew <body> I have used homebrew to install the newest version of bash on my local system. I have added a symbolic link from: code/usr/local/bin/bash/code to code/usr/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.20/bin/bash/code and added the line: code/usr/local/bin/bash/code to code/etc/shells/code  When I load my terminal I am still getting the older version of bash, also when i execute the command: code/etc/local/Cellar/bash/4.2.20/bin/bash/code my prompt changes to codebash-4.2$/code but when i do codebash --version/code it still says I am in version 3.2. Does anyone know what step I am missing?  <answer41745> You'll need to change your account's login shell from System Preferences, Users &amp; Groups. You need to access the Advanced Options by right-clicking on your username and changing your shell to code/usr/local/bin/bash/code. Once you've done that, restart Terminal.app (to make sure no old sessions with the wrong shell are left hanging around) and you should be set.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkLja.png" alt="Change login shell"  You can do the same using codedscl/code:  precodedscl . -change /Users/&lt;username&gt; UserShell /usr/local/bin/bash /code/pre  <comment47375> Are you sure about the logging out part? I've always found that simply restarting Terminal.app is enough. But I don't remember if I had to log out for Lion. <comment47441> Good point - it's probably not necessary (restarting Terminal.app should suffice). I'll adjust my answer - thanks. <comment47488> Interesting, I already have this line this set. But the bash version is still 3.2. <comment47524> @trev9065 Are you sure it's not because of your $PATH? Can you do an "echo $BASH_VERSION" after opening Terminal.app and let us know the results? <comment47538> @mjturner ok so when i did  `echo $BASH_VERSION` it gave me 4.2, why is the bash variable set but not the path. Should I set the path to my `/usr/local/bin/bash` or is it not necessary? <comment47549> @trev9065 It seems like your $PATH has /usr/bin before /usr/local/bin, so when you run "bash --version", /usr/bin/bash (ie 3.2) is run, and not /usr/local/bin/bash (4.2). Solution is to re-order your $PATH (in .bashrc or .bash_profile for example). Your shell is definitely 4.2 though (as evidenced by the result of the "echo $BASH_VERSION"). <comment216854> Thanks for this. Helped me out a lot. @trev9065 you should accept this answer and grant the rep he earned.
