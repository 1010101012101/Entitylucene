Force a change to a program's key bindings <body> Is it possible to force a change to a program's keybindings?  E.g., instead of an menu action being invoked by Cmd-J it's Cmd-K?  The reason I ask is that Cmd-Q in Firefox drives me nuts.  I occasionally hit it instead of Cmd-W (to close a tab) &amp; I have to wait for my entire instance of Firefox to stop &amp; then restart.  I'd love to bind "Quit" to something ridiculous (or remove it all together).  My hope is this is in a resource file that's easily hacked?  <answer1129> No resource file hacking necessary; it's all built in to the GUI. And not only that, but Apple's even documented it:  ul liUsing global keyboard shortcuts /li liCreating keyboard shortcuts for applications/li /ul  (the above assumes you're on OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, but everyone with a supported system should be by now.)  <comment930> I think this link will help you http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/808/find-and-change-system-shortcut <comment1004> Thanks!  I didn't know you could do that.  However, in the case of quitting Firefox it doesn't seem to work.  I've mapped to something crazy (Cmd-Opt-Shift-P) to Quit, and I'm mapped Cmd-Q to Find.  It shows up correctly in the menu, however, Cmd-Q still quits Firefox. <comment1005> Hmmm.. see me comment below, but that doesn't seem to work in my case.  Does Cmd-Q or Quit have special properties?
