After Installing El Capitan I Will be Logged Out Frequently <body> ul liMacPro late 2009 with 3 monitors. OSX 10.11.1/li liWill run great on 1 monitor without screen/system freeze or logouts. At times it is an instant logout, other times, the primary monitor freezes, or is filled with weird graphics. NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 512 MB/li liBegan with 12 G Ram and upgraded to 24 after having problems with El Capitan. Suspected OS memory leak. /li liThen did full erase and OS install, but before restoring my data, created new user and used Safari to test. On each monitor, a Safari tab streaming news videos. Ran for hours, but when I started using the system, it had video problems and locked up or logged out. Don't remember which.  /li liThen restored all my backup data and settings./li liActivity Monitor shows full 24 G installed, but the Memory Used and Cached Files never go above 12 G/li liTechTools 8, all test pass. Memory, video, temperature, fans etc. /li liApple Care 2nd level tried to no avail./li liSystem performed flawlessly until El Capitan install/li liSystem now is totally unreliable. I installed 10.11.2 yesterday and am hopeful that fixed it for me as it has many others. I'll update. /li liIt appears that 10.11.2 has fixed it. This was the first time I had an update go bad, thankfully. Communication would go a long way, but results are always appreciated. I still feel they (Apple) are the best horse in the race. BTW here is the Apple Support thread on this; https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7252069?start=0&amp;tstart=0/li /ul  <answer266069> From  https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21782:     strongOS X El Capitan: Set your Mac to log out when not in use/strong      You can set your Mac to automatically log out the current user after a   set period of inactivity. This helps ensure that your information is   secure when your Mac is unattended.      ul   liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Security &amp; Privacy, then click General./li   liClick the lock icon to unlock it, then enter an administrator name and password./li   liClick Advanced./li   liSelect “Log out after... minutes of inactivity.”/li   liSet the amount of time before the user is automatically logged out./li   /ul   <comment264893> Everything you say would make me suspect overheat or underpower [GPU or PSU fail, especially pushing 3 screens from a GT120] **except** for the term 'logout'. Do you literally mean it logs you out & presents you with the user login screen again, or do you actually mean it crashes/reboots? If it's a true logout, then I'd try setting up a new admin user & test it under that. <comment264898> Yes, I'm presented with the Login screen. I forgot to mention that Apple support had me add another user. The new user also gets logged out. Also when I had reloaded and before any of my data was reloaded, I exercised the system. I opened Safari, (normally I use Chrome) by opening a tab on each monitor and playing a news video. It eventually logged out.
