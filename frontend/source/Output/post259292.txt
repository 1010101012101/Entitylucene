macOS did not apply new time zone settings <body> I live in Turkey and recently Turkish government has opted out of Daylight Saving system, locking the country's time zone into UTC+3 permanently. If there wasn't this change in action, time should have been adjusted -1 hour into UTC+2 today midnight. But since the new regulation, there shouldn't have been taken any action by the OS and it should have stayed at UTC+3 (time shouldn't have changed at all). But it did on my Mac.  My iPhone didn't change time time (correct behaviour) and now it is 12:26 as I'm writing here in UTC+3. My Mac adjusted itself to UTC+2 and now it's 11:26 on my Mac (incorrect behavior).  I've updated the time settings (codesudo ntpdate -u time.apple.com/code), I'm sure that I'm in the right time zone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mdUqW.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Yet it's still at the incorrect time zone.  How can I fix this problem (without manually adjusting my Mac's timezone to some other country's with the UTC+3 timezone)?  <answer259297> Okay, there was an awaiting macOS update that I forgot about. I've applied the update, restarted, and the time zone corrected itself.  <comment324429> I've got the same problem. There is no such awaiting time zone update. Any clue about it? By the way I am not using sierra yet. <comment324688> @ferhat do you have the latest updates (other than Sierra)? if yes, try restarting your computer if you didn't. latest update + restart fixed my issue, but again, I was on Sierra. <comment325045> The real solution to this problem is to never vote for any government that would make a time zone change on less than 18 months' notice. <comment325060> @MikeScott I don't wanna go off-topic, but do you really think that I voted for those murderers?
