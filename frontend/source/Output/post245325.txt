Pages app in trash <body> Having tried to create and then delete a folder in Pages I now find that if I try to open Pages from the dock I get a message: "You can’t open the application “Pages” because it is in the Trash. To open this application, move it from the Trash." However I don't see it listed in trash. I can still open Pages from the launchpad.  Any ideas?  <answer245346> ol liClose Pages (quit)/li liRemove the Pages shortcut from the dock/li liOpen Pages from the launchpad or from Spotlight/li liOnce Pages opens, click on the dock icon and choose options, then keep in dock./li /ol
