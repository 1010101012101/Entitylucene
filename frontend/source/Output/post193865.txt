New iTunes App installation <body> After updating my iTunes to the new 12.2.0.145 I can no longer manage the apps on my iPhone 6+ from iTunes.  The apps show up and there is the install/uninstall buttons beside them, but they are grayed out and unavailable.    Anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?    <answer193870> Did you update to iOS 8.4 yet?br If not, now would be the time.    In iTunes - sync; backup; update.   If you're already on 8.4, then sync; backup; restore.  <comment231150> Normally that would fix the issue, and it would have been  of my list if my phone were not cydia enabled.  8.4 isn't compatible so I am still running 8.1.2 <comment231151> That would tell me it's not the iTunes update that's broken then, it's the jailbreak. I'd look to cydia for a fix. <comment231162> Your iTunes is now incompatible with your iOS version. Either downgrade iTubes or upgrade iOS.
