Where else can I download the legacy Java SE 6 runtime? <body> I just upgraded to OSX Yosemite.  I am trying to open my Adobe Flash CS6 app, but it says     To open "Flash" you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.   A simple google search yields this page: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6604985  There are several links there - however, they all lead to the same site: a downloads page from Apple that offer the required Java SE runtime. The page is the following:  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US  But it cannot be viewed, since it has a redirect loop.  Where else can I download this?  <answer181541> Go to https://www.apple.com/support/ then search for DL1572  See Apple Knowledgebase pages often blank  sup EDIT - or in this case, notâ€¦ as it doesn't seem to fix it/sup  strongUpdate:/strongbr Original KB link appears to be working again.br Would appear to have been an Apple issue, now resolved.  <answer181551> The problem appears to be that the page is set to redirect to itself.  Using the Live HTTP Headers plugin for Chrome shows the following code being returned by the server.  precodeHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily Cache-Control: no-siteapp Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 0 Date: Sat, 18 Apr 2015 20:08:55 GMT Location: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_GB Server: AkamaiGHost /code/pre  Essentially telling it to redirect to itself. Not sure though whether this is a problem on Apple's server or Akamai's.  A bunch of their download pages seem to be broken right now. Even the main download page has this redirect issue at the moment.  <comment215903> If I perform such search, it sends me to this page: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US - which has a redirect loop. <comment215907> Yeah, it usually works, but I'm getting nowhere fast on that one right now
