Disk Utility - 3 Pass Erase <body> Just for my curiosity and knowledge,  I read on a book that Disk Utility can erase a Volume/Partition by using different option of security.  Among these options there is one called: 3 Pass Erase, that writes two passes of random data followed by a single pass of known data to the disk.  According to Apple, this option meets strongUS Department of Energy/strong.  What does the strongUS Department of Energy/strong have to do with secure erasing data? Do they control the security standard? I thought was the Department of Defense that control the standards.  Thank you  <answer136276> The 3 pass erase method, where two passes are random data and one is known data is listed in DoE M 205.1-6. The DoE among their other sensitive operations, designs, tests, and builds the US nuclear arsenal. Different agencies often develop different methods to achieve same results.  Also, I don't think either agency uses either of those methods anymore.  <comment161619> Got a link to that source please? <comment161786> Book - OS X Support Essentials 10.9 - Supporting and Troubleshooting OS X Maveriks
