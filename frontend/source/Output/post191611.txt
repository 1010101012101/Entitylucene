Changing ownership of .cpan <body> I'm getting back into Perl; several months ago I had to have a new hard drive installed and so had to start over again. When I try to update CPAN, I get this message:  Your configuration suggests that CPAN.pm should use a working directory of     /Users/lolajl/.cpan Unfortunately we could not create the lock file     /Users/lolajl/.cpan/.lock due to 'Permission denied'.  Looking at /Users/lolajl directory, I'm seeing this:  precodedrwxr-xr-x    4 lolajl  staff    136 Nov 27  2014 .config drwxr-xr-x    8 root    staff    272 Jun 14 20:14 .cpan /code/pre  When I try  to run "sudo chown root:lolajl .cpan", I get:  precodechown: lolajl: illegal group name /code/pre  How do I get this corrected so that CPAN can run properly?  <answer191617> You're trying to change the ownership to owner "root" and group "lolajl", and "lolajl" isn't a legal group. Instead, try the following:  precodesudo chown lolajl:staff .cpan /code/pre  which will change .cpan to be owned by user "lolajl" and group "staff".  <comment227662> That worked . . . thanks!
