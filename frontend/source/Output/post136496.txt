How do I speed up the network discovery of windows servers from my mac? <body> I just bought my first MacBook Pro. One frustration I have is accessing my shared windows-based network assets. I have two servers on the network, but they seem to take forever to be discovered by my MBP.  Use Case:  ol liI open my MBP/li liOnce connected to WiFi, I open Finder and then Go  Network/li liI wait and wait and wait and wait for the windows-based network assets to be discovered/li /ol  I'm not sure how long it takes because I usually just go about doing other things then check back. I think it could take up to a half hour though (more/less). Sometimes, even when I can see the server, it takes an unacceptably long time to connect to it.   Is there any way to improve this?  Is the problem a mac/pc thing?  <comment164371> I would love to hear other people's experience of this -- i find the same problem, and want to know if it's the way i have my network set up, or if it's something about Mac networking. <comment179528> Same problem for me. I don't wait to 'discover' the device, but connect to it directly. (Under the menu Go  Connect to Sever), but even then sometimes it takes a long time. <comment179940> Same here. I've noticed that on my new MBP with 16GB RAM, this has been less of an issue, but it's still much slower than I'd like.
