Application not responding, process missing <body> I have an odd issue. Sometimes it happens that application (happens almost always to NetBeans) is stuck in the dock with "Not Responding" - I can't open it, if I select "Force quit" id doesn't do anything (both from dock and from "Force quit" window.  The most annoying thing - there is no associated process that I could kill!  The only way to start application again is to restart the whole osx, which is PITA.  How can I force-force-quit of such application?  <comment206881> Does it still show up in Activity Monitor or if you run `ps aux` in Terminal? <comment206894> as I said - there is no associated process - neither in activity monitor nor as a result of ps aux (neither for netbeans, java nor bash - I've read it may also be listed).
