How to build a simple app that turns text to m4a files <body> I'm learning Chinese and want a way to quickly generate and save words and phrases to m4a files.  I've managed to do pretty much what I want in terminal, but I can't seem to figure out how to make an app out of it. Here is the code I've used in terminal:  precodecd ~/Desktop/test say -o "whateveriwantittosay.m4a" "whateveriwantittosay" /code/pre  How do I make an shell or Apple script that when opened prompts me for whateveriwantittosay, then creates the file? And maybe even asks me again for a new file.  Thanks!  <answer91091> i would use python for this... since it is included in the vanilla OSX distibution.  Check wxPython together with pyApp assuming you mean a gui-based app..  Using python you can use subprocess in order to call any terminal command from python eg:  precodeimport subprocess subprocess.call("date") /code/pre  <answer91094> Simple Automator Application :   ul liCreate a new Application /li liAdd a strongAsk for text/strong action/li liAdd a strongRun a sheel script/strong action/li liSelect strongPass input as Arguments/strong/li liCopy the following script (Assuming ~/Desktop/Test exists) /li /ul  =  precodecd ~/Desktop/Test say -o "$@.m4a" $@ /code/pre  ul liSave your application.

Can you provide a sample python script which accomplishes what the asker is looking for in the question? <comment106983> If you add a function like `cnsay() { for a; do say "$a" -o ~/"Desktop/$a.m4a"; done; }` to `~/.bash_profile`, you could run it with something like `cnsay word1 word2`. <comment106987> Question was edited since i answered to specify a shell or applescript. <comment106989> Python is ok as well <comment106994> Perfect. Thank you!
