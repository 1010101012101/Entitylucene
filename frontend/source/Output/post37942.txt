MacBook has poor Bluetooth range <body> My current workspace setup is a black MacBook that is plugged into a 21" monitor, with a Wireless Apple Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, both connected with Bluetooth. The issue is, I cannot take the two input components more than 12 to 18 inches away without either adding a delay or losing the signal entirely.   Is this normal? Is there anything I can do about it?   <answer37948> No, this isn't normal.  Considering the age of the machine, I'd guess that it's a failing Bluetooth card.  It could also be some sort of interference.  <answer37959> Try the following: * Use with open screen * Use 5gHz network instead of 2.4gHz (or better use ethernet).  This should help. If not - try the Bluetooth Diagnostics Utility.app  <answer42210> If it is really a case of poor Bluetooth range and not any interference. It might be that the Bluetooth antenna is loose / disconnecting from the Bluetooth card causing poor reception. Might not be a bad idea to double check the cable and make sure its connected and not corroded, etc. Before replacing the Bluetooth card.  If you are a DIY'er here is some more information on disassembling your MacBook see iFixit's guides for MacBooks. Other wise take it to a Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for help.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gbrcC.jpg" alt="Bluetooth Antenna MacBook pictured"  <comment275988> My range is like 4 feet, unbelievable because with he same bluetooth speaker my phone can be 20 feet away 2012 macbookpro
