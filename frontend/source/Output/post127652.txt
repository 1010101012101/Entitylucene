How can I use Automator to extract information from an email in Mail? <body> I'm trying to extract information from emails coming in from PayPal from my customers (first name, last name, address, phone #, order #, date) to create a database with that information.  The info will be used to create membership cards, so I need that info for the card itself, and then for a shipping label.  That database will be sent to a print shop and they will use it to print the vinyl cards and the shipping labels, as he's using FileMaker to do so.  Is there any easy way to do this, other than doing it manually?  <comment149569> @user75793 might be a seller of items on eBay, for example and is using PayPal as a merchant's intermediary. Can't PayPal provide you with a data dump of your accounting & customer data?
