Teamviewer scrolling speed <body> Back To My Mac recently stopped working for me, so I started using TeamViewer to access my home Mac from the outside world. It works great, for the most part. One thing that is frustrating me though is scroll speed. Regardless of what I use (magic mouse, trackpad), scrolling in the remote computer is too fast. It just jumps from the top of the list to the bottom instantly. I don't see any speed tuning controls in TeamViewer, and when I'm connected remotely there are no mice or trackpads displayed in System Preferences, so you can't adjust speed there either.  <comment143005> No idea why Back To Your Mac stopped to work? Wouldn't that solve the initial issue instead of the work-around problem you're facing now? <comment143042> Unfortunately BTMM like most Apple products provides almost no feedback, debugging info or options to mess with. It either works or it doesn't.
