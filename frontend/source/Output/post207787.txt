What do I do if Time Machine says "Waiting" to view a particular backup? <body> I have this happening on a Yosemite machine with a backup residing on another Yosemite machine.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zdm8X.png" alt="enter image description here"  Other backups further forward in time work fine. My desire is to delete this backup, but I can't because as long as it says "Waiting" there's no "Delete backup" option.  <answer207798> You can delete a backup via the codesudo tmutil delete/code command. You'll need administrative privileges to do this:  ol liOpen Terminal/li liType in codesudo tmutil delete/code (including end space, but emdon't/em press enter yet!)/li liGo to Finder, open your TM Drive, and open the codeBackups.backupdb/code folder/li liOpen your Machine/li liYou'll need to find the folder containing the backup you want to delete./li liDrag and drop the folder containing the backup you want to delete into Terminal./li liYour Terminal should say codesudo tmutil delete /Volumes/TM\ Drive/Backups.backupdb/Mac/2014.../code (backslashes are included before spaces)/li liNow press enter. You'll need to type you user password (it won't be displayed)./li /ol  <comment301876> Not really a soloution but I found that just straight up waiting 10 minutes for it to load let me however in my case I actually wanted to restore it not delete it. <comment301877> So it's really doing something. I never had the patience to wait that long. Sounds like a real solution to me!
