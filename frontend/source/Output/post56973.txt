How can I create a Saved Search that excludes a specific folder from the results? <body> I'm trying to set up a Saved Search of my Mac that will exclude files in a folder called 'XYZ' from the search results. The reason is because I'm getting a ton of false positives from that folder that are difficult to sort through.  Just to be clear, I know you can add folders to a "Privacy" list in the Spotlight preferences, but I don't want to add this folder to that list --because I don't want to exclude it from all future searches, just this specific saved search. Any idea how something like this could be done?  <answer57074> Currently, I don't think this can be done. There appears to be quite a few people trying to do this that Google finds and nobody has a real answer (other than the Privacy exclusion) :(  <answer57099> I looked at some of the saved search files in Finder's application bundle, and for example code/System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app/Contents/Resources/MyLibraries/myDocuments.cannedSearch/search.savedSearch/code used a format like this for excluding directories:  precode&lt;key&gt;FXScopeArrayOfPaths&lt;/key&gt; &lt;array&gt;   &lt;string&gt;~/&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-Library&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-Music/iTunes&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-Documents/Steam Content&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;~/Library/Mobile Documents/&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~Keynote&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~Pages&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;string&gt;-com~apple~Numbers&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/array&gt; /code/pre  So you can exclude subfolders by adding strings that start with a minus character after a full path. Something like code-~/Library/code doesn't seem to work.  You can edit savedSearch files by dropping them on a text editor. codeRawQueryDict:SearchScopes/code and codeFXScope:FXScopeArrayOfPaths/code seem to list the same paths by default, but just editing the second one appeared to exclude folders at least in Finder.  <answer60920> I was too suffering the same problem, and found a way to do so.  Go to Preference system  Spotlight  Select, then select "Privacy" tab, and you can add specific location(s) to exclude in Spotlight search.   I've tried, it works.  <answer89145> If you hold codeoption/code the (+) button to add a search criteria will become a (…) and an codeAny/All/None/code block. strongSet this to None/strong.  For the criteria select codeDocument Container/code. It won't be in the default list alongside codeName/code, codeKind/code, etc. Select codeOther…/code to select it from a list of additional criteria so long emit has its own search feature/em: img src="https://i.imgur.com/M4vlhB2.png" alt="All Those Attributes"  Set this to the name of the folder that you'd like to exclude using whatever codeis/contains/begins with/ends with/code you find suitable.  The end result should look something like this: img src="https://i.imgur.com/3CGb5kz.png" alt="result"  <answer91583> I want to add that if "Document Container" is not working for you (such as is my problem), you can set the Search Folder to opt in/out specific folders.   Pardon me, I do not have the "reps" to post images so I will do my best.  This is my first post so feel free to flame away.  For my music organization work-flow, I wanted the iTunes folder to hide erroneous sub-folders.  Of course, moving folders out of the iTunes folder was not an option since it would break/freak-out iTunes into re-creating those same folders.  Here is how I accomplished this by tweaking Lake's above method:   ol liNavigate to iTunes folder, in Finder Menu  File  "New Smart Folder"/li liIn initial search criteria select codeKind/code  codeis/code  codeFolder/code/li liFollowing Lake's lead, in the drop-down created by holding codeoption/code and (+), select codeAny/code codeof the following are true/code (this is for opting-in folders)  To opt-out folders as Lake mentioned above, change 'Any' to 'None'/li liSince I am "Opting in" folders I then nested 5 criteria underneath the codeAny/code option which looked like this (actual folder names are used for example):/li /ol     codeName/code codeis/code "Automatically Add to iTunes"br   codeName/code codeis/code "Music"br   codeName/code codeis/code "MUSIC TO ADD - MAIN FOLDER"br   codeName/code codeis/code "TuneUp Results"br   codeName/code codeis/code "MusicBrainz Tagging"br   So the end result is that when I click on the Smart Search (located in the Finder sidebar for me) I will only see the 5 folders I want to without destroying the inherent folder layout of the main folder the reside in.  I do hope this helps.  <answer108891> In the finder when you are searching for files, you can exclude them by adding minus in front of the criteria. For e.g. I want to search for all the files that is not pdf files, I can write "Kind is -pdf". This seems to work for me.  <answer129870> I am pretty sure that I've found a different way to do this.   In configuring the smart folder, use a Raw Query search attribute. By default, this is not in the search attribute drop down menu, so you will need to find it by clicking Other at the bottom of the drop down menu.   In the input box next to Raw Query, type:  precodekMDItemPath != "/Users/yourname/Documents/foldertoexclude"  /code/pre  in which the text in quotation marks is the pathname of the folder to be excluded, which can be found via Get Info.  <comment65454> After some Googling and fiddling with my own test searches I don't think this can be done :( <comment65526> That seems to be the general consensus. Thanks for taking the time to look into it. I'll mark this question as complete if you want to submit that as an answer. <comment65569> You may have discovered something here. This seems to work! Thanks for figuring this out. You've saved me quite a headache -- and likely countless others who will find this question in the future. <comment65583> Shame it can't be done without editing XML but yes, very nicely found :) <comment78665> Anyone know if a folder name can be matched regardless of path?  ie. ignore sub-folder /nospotlight in every parent folder, /folder1/nospotlight, /folder2/nospotlight.... <comment107548> Welcome to the site! Thanks for taking the time to describe your solution in detail If you think a screenshot would help, please upload it to a public sharing site (e.g. Dropbox) and add a link to the answer or in the comments. Somebody with more reputation will then embed it into your answer. <comment111657> This works, and should have been the selected answer. :) Thank you. <comment180452> This doesn't work for me on OSX 10.9.5 <comment180453> This does not work for me on OSX 10.9.5 <comment180717> Just checked in 10.10 [Yosemite] and it seems unchanged. I don't have a 10.9 [Mavericks] machine at hand to verify at the moment but I don't recall it being missing. What part doesn't work for you? <comment227786> Possible reason why `Document Container` may not be usable to exclude folders : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/132860/smart-folder-filter-does-not-contain (It does not work for me on 10.8.5) <comment273441> I can confirm that this works by editing files under `~/Library/Saved Searches` in OSX 10.10.x <comment279371> Did you miss this part? 'Just to be clear, I know you can add folders to a "Privacy" list in the Spotlight preferences, but I don't want to add this folder to that list --because I don't want to exclude it from all future searches, just this specific saved search.' <comment299068> I was really hoping this would work, but no joy.
