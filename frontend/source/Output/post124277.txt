Some texts automatically underlined in iPhone 5 with iOS 7.1 <body> I am using iPhone 5 with iOS 7.1, My problem is text automatically underlined on some buttons in the application   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xD0Rv.png" alt="sample Image"  Is there any settings available to remove the underline? Or how to fix this issue ?  <answer124351> This is a change to show which button labels are pressable.  You should go to codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility/code and turn on/off strongButton Shapes/strong and then revisit the app in question. You should only see underlines and shapes when this control is on, and this is to indicate what buttons that look like text are actually tappable for those with accessibility needs.  <comment145383> Some buttons in what application(s)? Please be more specific.  The above screenshot looks like more like a link in html.. <comment145435> I put an answer, but without knowing which apps have buttons styled the way you posted, it might be a wrong guess. Let us know or edit those details into the post. <comment145500> Thanks. Notification is not alerting but showing on notification panel. even if i am setting Alert type as Banners/Alert. <comment150197> it is possible to remove underline programatically in objective c ???
