Resizing a custom image on toolbar button in PowerPoint for Mac 2011 through VBA <body> I have created a toolbar for PowerPoint 2011 for Mac. I have pasted custom images for icons on the toolbar buttons.   The problem is the images appear very small on the buttons and when I increase the height and width of the buttons, the buttons grow to the specified size but the images do not and they look awful.  Can anyone suggest a possible workaround so that I can increase the size of the image on the custom toolbar buttons?  I am using the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code.PasteFace/code function to put the images on the buttons.  <answer125720> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xSqj.jpg" alt="button image"In the shared button image of the custom button, you can see that even if the size of the custom button has been increased, the image appears very small.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0nK69.jpg" alt="button image"  <comment146961> Just out of interest in your project, could you show us a sample (a link to screenshot would be fine) <comment147134> instead of posting this as an answer, just edit it into your question.
