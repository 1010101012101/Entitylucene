Living with notifications in a many-tabbed world <body> I like notifications. I also like having many browser tabs open. When my browser is fully zoomed on my main screen, notifications can cover the rightmost tab. When I'm in a busy chat or other notification-heavy situation, they cover it constantly, and I have to move the window to get access to click the tab.  I'm looking for a better way to have my cake and eat it, too â€“ is there some way to have the notifications, but not have this situation? For example, I don't ever really want to interact with the notifications, so if I can click behind them, that would be fine. What do you suggest?  <answer209249> I would use IFTTT + Pushbullet/iOS/other push notifications.  ol liAdd every channel you need to IFTTT./li liMake if %message% then send a note to Pushbullet strongOR/strong to IF Notifications./li liEnjoy!/li /ol  <comment252374> I hope Apple will reconsider the built in notifications sometime. They absolutely do cover the screen and can be annoying to work around even though they are convenient to see.
