iPhone's space problem <body> Looking at my iPhone via iTunes, i see a very questionable amount of "Other".  What is it? How can i delete it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SJDFY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer170949> In my experience, iTunes' space meter is fairly unreliable (by which I mean that I've seen it jump by gigabytes with no apparent cause, and occasionally say that my space was over the limit when that's obviously impossible).  On your iPhone, go to Settings  General  Usage  Manage Storage to see exactly what's taking up all that space.  <comment201086> If the "Other" is not in use, it should go away by itself soon.  If it really bothers you, try restarting the iPhone. <comment201095> "'Other' represents settings, calendar events, notes, browser cache, email, email attachments, and more nonmedia data."
