Mac Book Pro - View movie while keyboard disabled? <body> I have a toddler that wants to push all the keys while watching a video or movie. Can I disable the keyboard while he is watching it? OR Is there a hard snap on cover that can go over the keyboard and trac pad?  <answer96715> As someone who has had personal experience putting keys back on after a toddler ripped them out, I would highly suggest simplifying matters and buying one of those neoprene sleeves (found here -- make sure you get the right size) for your notebook, and put the bottom section of your notebook inside the case, while still leaving the display visible.  <answer96717> You can try KeyboardCleanTool (download in upper right). I just searched everywhere and it seems to be the only tool for Mac that does this exact thing for free and is still available. I just did a quick test and it seems to work like a charm.  <comment113815> Did you find any good answers to this question?
