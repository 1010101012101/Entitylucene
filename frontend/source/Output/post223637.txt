Why is Jawbone UP step data deleted from Health app after midnight? <body> How do I get the iOS Health app to retain the previous days' worth of step data?  The iOS Health app only shows the current day's steps.  My UP3 is set up to be the primary data source for updating the Steps tracker in the Health app.  During the day, when I check the Health app, the steps recorded match the steps registered in the UP app.  However, when I wake up in the morning, the previous day's steps are gone from the Health app and when I click on "Show All Data" it only show's the present day's data - there is nothing from any previous days. Interestingly, the Health app records and retains all previous days' worth of Sleep Analysis data synced from UP app.   h2Hardware and Software/h2  ul liiPhone 6 running iOS 9.2 (up to date)/li liJawbone UP3 with firmware: 1.2.14 (up to date)/li liUP by Jawbone version 4.12.1 (up to date)/li /ul  <comment277483> I have the same issue with my UP3. But on some days the data is there. I have not figured out jet how to prevent deleting the data. It would be nice to have the correct stepcount in health app. <comment279450> Please can you contact [Jawbone support](https://help.jawbone.com/contact). This sounds like a software bug and something they should be made aware of.
