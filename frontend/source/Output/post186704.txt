How can I export my system preferences? <body> Is there a way for me to export my system preferences on my Mac for quick install on another machine?  An example of what I am trying to accomplish is, when I start a new job, I would like to import my settings and have my system preference work without having to manually configure all of my custom settings.  I am most interested in exporting settings for :  ul liTrackpad / Mouse/li liKeyboard/li liDock/li lidashboard (I like to disable it)/li /ul  <answer186707> There's not exactly an export function. You can find (most) preferences in the library. If you hold alt/option and select "Go To" in the Finder menu bar, you can open the user library. There's a folder named preferences which contains the corresponding files. Named like com.apple.xy.plist, where xy is 'dock' for example.  <answer186739> If you cannot find an app/applet that does this, you might need to hack it yourself through Terminal. Take Bluetooth Trackpad for example:  Run:  precodedefaults read com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.trackpad /code/pre  I get:  precode{     Clicking = 0;     DragLock = 0;     Dragging = 0;     TrackpadCornerSecondaryClick = 0;     TrackpadFiveFingerPinchGesture = 2;     TrackpadFourFingerHorizSwipeGesture = 2;     TrackpadFourFingerPinchGesture = 2;     TrackpadFourFingerVertSwipeGesture = 2;     TrackpadHandResting = 1;     TrackpadHorizScroll = 1;     TrackpadMomentumScroll = 1;     TrackpadPinch = 1;     TrackpadRightClick = 1;     TrackpadRotate = 1;     TrackpadScroll = 1;     TrackpadThreeFingerDrag = 0;     TrackpadThreeFingerHorizSwipeGesture = 2;     TrackpadThreeFingerTapGesture = 2;     TrackpadThreeFingerVertSwipeGesture = 2;     TrackpadTwoFingerDoubleTapGesture = 1;     TrackpadTwoFingerFromRightEdgeSwipeGesture = 3;     USBMouseStopsTrackpad = 0;     UserPreferences = 1;     version = 5; } /code/pre  These are my settings for external trackpad. You get find the same results by opening   code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.plist/code  but simply copying and pasting the code.plist/code file to a new computer doesn't change the settings. You have to use codeimport/code (and codeexport/code) options.  precodedefaults export com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad ~/Desktop/Test.plist /code/pre  Move codeTest.plist/code to the new computer, and:  precodedefaults import com.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad ~/Desktop/Test.plist /code/pre  <answer186745> I updated my answer because all of it was wrong:  hr  You will want to use an applescript for your preference setups. Here is the code for some of them and screenshots of the actual plist so you get an idea of the options possible. IF this does not apply straight away, you might need to restart the computer. strongDon't forget to save applescript as an Application. NOT script/strong  h1Trackpad/Mouse/h1  In here, it varies. It is either codecom.apple.driver.AppleHIDMouse/code for mouse, codecom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse/code for bluetooth mouse, and codecom.apple.AppleMultitouchTrackpad/code for trackpad  precodetell application "Terminal" do shell script "defaults write com.apple.AppleHIDMouse Button2 1" end tell /code/pre  The example above changes right click to be left click as well  h1Keyboard/h1  Unfortunately, I could not find a preference for keyboard. I will keep on searching though.  h1Dock/h1  precodetell application "Terminal" do shell script "defaults write com.apple.dock autohide YES" end tell /code/pre  This was just an example. Switch autohide with whatever option and YES with value or boolean. Booleans are YES and NO (unlike in scripts "true" "false") I put a picture on the end so you can see all the possible options for all the options.  h1Disable Dashboard/h1  I also could not find how to. Though it is presumably in codecom.apple.spaces/code  Dock options: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4F6DW.png" alt="enter image description here"  Mouse: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MCOzl.png" alt="enter image description here"  Bluetooth Mouse img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gwG4I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment220494> What system preference exactly are you trying to export? It is needed so I can provide the code necessary for a quick install <comment220495> Thanks @TheBro21. I just updated the question. <comment220532> I will be updating my answer adding more due to the fact that I don't have time ;) For now, I put the mouse/trackpad <comment220540> Ok I finished the full answer. I am at my iPad though. So make sure to dheck if for example `com.apple.preference.mouse` is correct by doing the ls command. Once you have done the script, you can save it as application and double click anywhere and it will install. <comment220601> Changed the answer fully, because it was all wrong, and all the preferences are withouth the ....preference.... in the name.
