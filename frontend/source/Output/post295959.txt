The Java JAR file ... could not be launched <body> I'm trying to download the file http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar and launch it with Jar Launcher (the default application). However, I'm getting this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KrsWp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Following https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4827576?tstart=0, I've also tried to use Archive Utility; this appears to create an codealgs4.jar.cpgz/code file but I'm not sure what to do with it. How can I open the JAR file?  <comment373774> What error messages did you see on the Console?
