Is there Spotify-Connect-Equivalent functionality for Apple Music? <body> I have an Apple Music subscription and iTunes 12.2 on an HTPC (Windows) which his my primary music player. I want to use my iPhone to control what I play. I've tried the Apple Remote app, which works, but it only allows me to choose music that I've added to my library. It does not allow me to look up an arbitrary song from the cloud (whatever the term for this is - it's the functionality under the "New" section of iTunes on OSX) and play it from the Remote. If I want to do that I have to do it directly on HTPC, which is not acceptable.  Basically I just want Spotify Connect functionality for Apple Music. If it's from the Remote app, great. If it's from the Music app, great. What has been the most successful approach from others with a similar need?  <answer194213> Not much of a solution, but it's worth noting that the last update to the Remote app (4.2.2) was released on May 21st, before the announcement of Apple Music. It wouldn't surprise me that a future update would address this unacceptable issue.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mk0m4.jpg" alt="Apple Remote app"  If it does not, I would immediately destroy my iPhone and buy a Zune.  <answer194226> Your iPhone is a first tier player in Apple Music. It would be better to just play the music on your phone rather than monkey with "remote". Send the music over the network to the PC rather than sending the remote commands over the network to the PC.  Remote options are:  ul liWait for Apple's remote to get updated for the hot newness/li liGet a VNC/RDC remote and control the PC (janky - but does 100% what the PC can do without needing anything else on the PC end) screen directly./li liThird party remotes like Rowmote Pro (I say like since I have a handful of iPhone to Mac remotes - just can't recommend specific PC ones)/li /ul  The iPhone can AirPlay to a PC quite easily with software on the PC such as AirFoil for Windows and you're set with Apple's full fledged iOS music controls but taking advantage of the PC to speaker connection you have already set up.  Depending on how the PC outputs to speakers, you could also add hardware ($5 to $65) to get the sound from either the PC or the iOS devices to the speakers. You don't need to do that as there are several workable software solutions.  <answer194275> iTunes allows you to send Audio/Music from the new Music service to multiple Air Play speakers.  The Music App on the phone only allows one speaker.  Without using a third party product like Airfoil or third party remote on a iDevice there is no way to control the Music service via iTunes natively within the Apple ecosystem. This is limiting for people that have set up iTunes at the heart of their multi speaker audio system.  iPhone only act as remotes in my house, never the source.   Hopefully they will update remote quickly to give us this ability.  It's the first thing I tried to do with the new service, and it is holding me back from using it more.  <answer194364> I have Itunes 12.2.0. I can play a radio station on Apple Music Radio and using the remote app by Apple, I can control my mac's iTunes playing Apple Music. So yes it is possible.   <answer218450> strongNo. A feature equivalent to Spotify Connect is currently not available for Apple Music./strong  For other remote options currently avaiable, see bmike's answer.  <comment231591> So what's your question?  I see a bunch of declarative statements, but we expect you to craft a well-focused, answerable question that admits a single objectively-correct answer.  I encourage you to edit the question to pose a question explicitly. <comment231597> Awesome Zune invocation! <comment231598> @D.W. The "ask" is buried in the "if I want to do that, I have to do it directly on the PC" and also confused with the negative (not possible) title and "not acceptable" modifier to not having a remote. <comment231599> The title of the question is exactly the question - can someone verify that it's not possible to remote control Apple Music on a PC, or alternatively disprove it. To expect a single objectively correct answer is to purposefully oversimplify this or any question on Stack Exchange. Using AirPlay might be a good workaround, but it would clearly be better if someone pointed out that the Remote app can actually do what I expect, or if the iPhone Music app now has some Remote capability built in. <comment231600> I'm going to try the Airplay solution. It would be nice to not have to install a separate utility but it may be the best available option right now. <comment231613> 1. Please edit your post to state the question explicitly.  Don't force us to infer it from your statements or from the title.  2. As far as questions that admit a single correct answer -- I realize it's counterintuitive, but that's how Stack Exchange works.  (See, e.g., http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask, https://blog.stackexchange.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/,  http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/126576/160917.)  I'm sure you can pose a good question that meets the requirements here -- but don't make us read between the lines to infer what your question is. <comment231614> @bmike, I understand one can form a guess at the author's intended question by scrutinizing the post carefully enough, but I shouldn't have to guess. <comment231666> I should add that the remote app on the iWatch is also way behind in features than the Music app on the iWatch.  Remote appears to be the poor cousin of Apple apps. <comment231723> Wait @bmike, you mean Zune is dead? <comment231744> This does not provide an answer to the question. To critique or request clarification from an author, leave a comment below their post - you can always comment on your own posts, and once you have sufficient [reputation](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation) you will be able to [comment on any post](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment). <comment231754> Zed is dead, baby - ZED IS DEAD! <comment231817> Yes, that's possible, but it's not what I'm talking about. I don't know the correct term for it - to be able to look up a particular song that you don't own in the Apple Music cloud and play that. The radio feature you are referring to is Pandora-like - you don't get to choose what plays. <comment231839> "the" poor cousin?  I wish. <comment233382> @Buscarì›ƒSD This is actually a great answer to the question. AirPlay is probably the best workaround to achieve what I wanted with the current state of things. <comment233383> Ok, I have edited the question to address most of the issues. In my mind the largest negative about the question is that 80% of the text on one's screen when viewing it is comments about people complaining about the question, offering no useful information for future visitors. Maybe we should delete all these comments next. <comment264078> however it will possibly be added to either itunes or the remote app at some point; if or when is up to Apple to decide though.
