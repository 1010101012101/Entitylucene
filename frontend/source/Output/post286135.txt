Iphone 5S problem <body> I am having a problem with my iPhone 5S. Apple had disabled my account for security reasons and I have forgotten my Hotmail id so I could not reset my password. I don't have any pay slip of this phone now as a bought it two-three years back. Please help me what should I do now. Somebody suggest me about Jailbreaking. Is it helpful?  <comment360945> Speak to Apple. No-one else can help. <comment360947> Somebody suggest me about Jailbreaking. Is it helpful? As I have already spoken to Apple and they need a pay slip that I don't have. <comment360950> jailbreaking the phone won't get your account back. The account is policed by Apple - they are the only people who can actually get it 'out of jail'
