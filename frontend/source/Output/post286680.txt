Dock icon for background app still bounces when opening <body> I'm currently using a cloud storage app that runs in the background to keep my files synchronised. As it has an icon in the Menu Bar, I used the advice from Hide Adium (or any other app&#39;s) icon in the dock in order to remove the dock icon when the app is open (as well as some other UI elements).  However, when I first start the app, the icon still bounces on the dock briefly before disappearing. Is there some way to prevent this happening, such that just the Menu Bar icon appears when the app is opened?  Thanks in advance.  <comment361754> What's the name of the app, and from where did you acquire it? Also, what version of OS X/macOS are you running? <comment361982> It's an in-house application that is provided by the institution I work for. I am currently running macOS Sierra (10.12.4). <comment361989> Since you're having an issue using an in-house app and you have not provided a tested and readily available way to reproduce the issue, then there is nothing I can do for you. <comment362121> Oh okay, I assumed it would just be a matter of adding/changing a key in the plist file.
