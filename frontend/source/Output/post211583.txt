How can I delete an e-mail account without getting into the account? <body> So I recently had an issue with my phone, went to Apple, and got a replacement phone. I restored my phone from a backup that was created that day, however when I went to restore my backup I had created, something happened. At the time, I didn't think it was anything wrong other than a few apps being out of place and a few missing passwords, however now I'm having an issue with the entire Mail app.  All of my accounts refuse to update in Mail, so as I was going through the process of deleting and re-adding them and I came across one that won't let me go into the account at all (which I assume is the larger culprit here). I click on the account in Settings, the account turns grey as it knows it's been selected (See photo below), then it hangs for anywhere from 3-5 minutes then crashes the Settings app.  Is there a way I can delete this account from either my computer or somewhere else on the phone or am I just never going to be able to use Mail again?
