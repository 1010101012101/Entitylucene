Is it possible the create a pkg that doesn't require root access (user & password prompt) <body> The title says it all really, is it possible to create a pkg that can install without the user requiring to enter their password?  <answer99786> There's an option in PackageMaker.  You can still install into code/Applications/code too, but the user would need to be in the codeadmin/code group because the default permissions for code/Applications/code are codedrwxrwxr-x+ 90 root  admin/code, so as long as the user is in codeadmin/code then they'll have write permissions.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPEtX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer112366> You can't install into code~/Applications/code without admin access and password. In 10.7 and onward Apple changed permissions so even admins need password to install into code/Applications/code, whether using installer or drag and drop.  <comment117348> What payload are you looking to install? If it's any type of application, or something that will be installed system-wide, the password will be required. <comment117405> @tubedogg It is an app bound for `/Applications`, but the pre-install script downloads a `tar.gz` to `/tmp` then extracts it to there - so I don't know if that makes a difference. Does the same apply for a dmg copy type of install? <comment117406> @tubedogg with PackageMaker I can't even seem to put a png into my home directory without it prompting me for my password? <comment117964> Hm like with most things in PackageMaker this seems a little buggy. This seems to work on 10.6.8, but I just tried to use that installer on 10.8.4 and it was still prompting <comment118913> Yea I think something was changed in 10.7 - in 10.7 and onwards the pkg Installer seems to prompt for root regardless of what you do. Installing on a pre-10.7 os it seems to respect this option and not prompt. I don't know if it's a bug or a security fix or what, but on 10.7 onwards I don't think there's a solution
