Custom app for raspberry pi control <body> I originally posted this question on the RPi Stackexchange, but was advised to move the question over here, because it is more apple-focused. Here is the question in it's entirety:  I am working on a system for my school to connect an LED Sign to a teacher's smartphone. The LED sign will display the route numbers of buses in our bus loop, which will be typed in by the teacher. The teacher that will be using this is an iOS user.  My teacher insists that I write a custom app for the project, but he does not know a lot about iOS. He recommended using cloudkit, and I thought homekit might work better, but both seem to be optimized for other purposes.  Is there a simple system (and easy, I just learned swift basics) that I can use where I will not have to set up my own intermediate server, and still allow the teachers to access it on another network?  <comment344253> Can you give a link to the StackExchange question - as it is off topic here. I suspect off topic as asking for external info or could also be too broad - also what is RPI StackExchnage <comment344258> deleted my answer. I was totally certain, that I would do a comment, silly me. @Mark RPI StackExchange is here: http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/ <comment344263> The web based interface for this Raspberry Pi robot arm is interesting. "In browser programming" https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mime/mearm-pi-build-your-own-raspberry-pi-powered-robot Watch the video. I have not looked into the IDE yet, but it looks like that *could* be a simple route for you. Here's the GetHub open source stuff: https://github.com/mimeindustries/mearm-js You may just be able to modify to suit your needs.
