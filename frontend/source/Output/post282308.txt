Mouse "randomly" slowing down or stuck in certain places (especially while starting a drag) <body> Since upgrading to Sierra (but could be other cause), my mouse slows down in certain points (as if something is intercepting the mouse move event and swallowing it). Sometimes this is accompanied by mouse cursor blinking between rapidly between different cursor shape, in a certain point which allows drag&amp;drop (only/especially when drag is started); then the mouse pointer becomes "stuck" as if moving in dense syrup, for a few seconds/pixels. But this happens as well when not drag&amp;dropping as well.   Though, the effect is weaker (though still negatively affects productivity).  An extreme case is when doing native HTML5 drag in Chrome...  Please note: this is not about emscrolling/em (unlike some questions which seem similar).  MacBook Pro Retina 13", late 2013. Two external DisplayPort monitors.  If this could be blamed on an app (as opposed to macOS sierra itself), then which kinds of apps would have such power to intercept and affect mouse-move events? Personally in my multiple decades of computing, I've never seen mouse-move being affected in such a way. Usually the mouse was moving the way it should...  Tried Safe Mode (holding shift while booting), but it completely fails to load (progress bar stuck at 100%)...  Time for a new macbook? Or time to go to Windows? :)  This is ruining my productivity (mouse moving at random speeds, sometimes 2-10 times slower).  Thanks for any hints! Does affect magic mouse 2 and logitech usb-cable mouse.  Problem does not seem to happen on MacBook's touchpad.  <answer282311> Since you can't seem to boot into Safe Mode, I would try either (or both) resetting the NVRAM and trashing the Magic Mouse .plist files.  strongResetting the NVRAM/strong  Your Mac uses Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).   Here’s how to rest it on your model MBP:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys. You have to make sure you press these keys strongbefore/strong the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li liLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongTrash Magic Mouse .plist files/strong  Since your issue persists both in and out of Safe Mode, I would trash the relevant Magic Mouse preference files.  As you don't specify what version of macOS you're using, I'll assume you're running a version from Mountain Lion and above. Follow these steps:  ol liGo to Finder/li liPress and hold the kbdoption/kbd key/li liWhile keeping the kbdoption/kbd key down, click on the Go menu and select emLibrary/em from the list/li liThis should open up your user's Library folder in a new Finder window/li liLocate and open the Preferences folder (it's within the Library folder)/li liWithin this folder find the following two .plist files:  ul licom.apple.AppleMultitouchMouse.plist/li licom.apple.driver.AppleBluetoothMultitouch.mouse.plist/li /ul/li liNow Trash these files/li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  Your Mac will now create a new set of default preference files for your Magic Mouse.   strongNote:/strong You will need to go back to System Preferences and reconfigure your Magic Mouse settings. However, strongbefore/strong doing that I would test the Magic Mouse first to see if the problem behaviour still persists.  strong[EDIT - following successful Safe Mode boot]/strong  Since you've now been able to boot into Safe Mode and the problem wasn't present, the first thing to do is to startup normally and see if the problem is still there. Sometimes just the act of booting into Safe Mode will resolve the issue.  If the problem is still there, the first thing I'd check is your login items. Login items can be incompatible sometimes with other software/hardware.  To do this:  ol liGo to Apple  System Preferences/li liClick on Users &amp; Groups/li liIn the lefthand pane, select your user name/li liNow select the Login Items tab (near top right)/li liTake a screenshot of the list that appears (kbdShift/kbdkbdCommand/kbdkbd4/kbd and select the list with your mouse cursor) strongor/strong just write down the list/li liNow click on the first item in the list so it's highlighted (i.e. click on the name, not the checkbox)/li liPress and hold the kbdShift/kbd key while you click on the last item in the list/li liAll items should be selected now. /li liLet go of the kbdShift/kbd key/li liClick on the minus kbd-/kbd button (at the bottom) to remove all items/li liExit System Preferences/li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  Once your Mac has booted up, test to see if your mouse is now working properly:  ul listrongIf your mouse works fine,/strong then start to add the items back one by one (using your list or screenshot). However, only add one item at a time and restart your Mac after each one. This process will help you identify which item was causing your mouse problems. Once you know which item it is, then remove that again from your Login Items./li listrongIf your mouse doesn't work fine,/strong let us know./li /ul  <comment355500> Right now what happened is that logitech usb-cable mouse is not affected at all, while magic mouse 2 is heavily affected. This happened after terminating karabiner grabber process. Not sure if related or just coincidence. The problem is quite random, thus perhaps Karabiner had nothing to do with it... <comment355504> I've just posted an answer. However, as an aside, since you've stated both here and in your other question that you can't boot into Safe Mode, I really think you should search for answers to that, and if you can't find one, ask another question relating to it. Being able to boot into Safe Mode is a key troubleshooting step, and it would be handy for both your questions. <comment355509> Thanks. I will try that soon. Regarding safe mode, I did not manage to enter it (hangs before logging in)! In general: do you have an idea what the real root cause could be? <comment355511> Since I'm quite caucious about doing stuff like resetting nvram or deleting plist file: I would like to ask you: what leads you to believe that the mouse slowing down has something to do with nvram or plist files? Instead of e.g. some faulty app or driver messing up input events? Meaning I gotta be sure that it's worth the hassle and the risk, so as not to mess it up even worse :D! Thanks! <comment355515> You don't need to do both - do one and if that doesn't resolve your issue, then try the other. Resetting the NVRAM is no big deal - it's a troubleshooting step that's been used on Macs for decades. In terms of trashing the .plist files, you can make a copy of them first and replace them again later if you're concerned. As for why I'm suggesting these courses of action, well, troubleshooting is a process of elimination, so we need to start somewhere. Since you can't boot into Safe Mode, this is just where I'm suggesting you start. Otherwise my first step would be Safe Mode. <comment355519> Thanks. Great explanation! Upvoted. Given the elimination approach, I sense that we don't [yet] have any hints regarding the possible real root cause(s), right? Will try your approaches soon. <comment355520> Good point. Upvoted. I just fear another rabbit hole. I recently had waaay too many rabit hole/ troubleshootings. Fearing that getting safe mode to work could turn into another "research project" of its own. Especially that I had problems with filesystem corruption which was somehow related to FileFault, requiring de-encrypting (no one found the real root cause, including apple-authorized tech support; just workaround; decrypting and re encrypting which then makes the problem reappear anyway). And the rabbit hole goes on and on. I hope you understand, I'm a bit tired of rabbit holes :). <comment355522> I'm also thinking of getting a new macbook pro retina. Which would give me fresh install, fresh FS, etc. But then who knows what problems will appear there. Optimism bias could mean tens of hours spent instead of saved :D. <comment355524> Asked about the safe mode problem: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/282315/unable-to-enter-safe-mode-gets-stuck-at-progress-bar-100-while-trying-to-log <comment355538> You don't need a new MacBook to get a fresh installation. You can do that now with your current model. Do you have a Time Machine (or other) backup? <comment355539> By the way, if you do reset the NVRAM this _may_ also help with your other question (re: LG monitor issue). <comment355625> Managed to boot to safe mode. It was just about waiting long enough. Bad UX on Apple part, I would say. Could say something like "pleas wait, this can take a long time".  Plus, it was hanging at 100%, which is rather illogical. <comment355627> So in safe mode, the problem with the mouse slowdown does NOT happen. A good way to try it is: open some app in App Store. And then try to drag the "write a review" link. <comment355668> That's good to know. I've just updated my answer re your next steps since you got Safe Mode to work. <comment358231> Holding shift in WebStorm over some code seems to cause it as well. And both on the touchpad and the mouse.
