Why is my Mac constantly trying to connect to another server? <body> After logging on, I see this dialog box pop up. Whenever I dismiss it, it reappears 30 seconds later. (Stealing focus at the same time! Grrrr!)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6xHsB.png" alt="There was a problem connecting to the server &quot;Slate&quot;."  "Slate" is my old iMac, which is sitting on the desk next to me, turned off. How can I stop my new Mac from constantly trying to connect to my old one? Both are running 10.7.1.  <answer25652> Check System PreferencesAccountsLogin Items to see if there is a disk that is supposed to mount when you login. Make sure you check emall/em of the user accounts.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7rnZQ.png" alt=""  <answer25910> I'm pretty sure this was happening because when I logged out, I was running an app which was located on the other computer.  I logged off and strongunchecked/strong the "Reopen windows when logging back in" box, which stopped Lion from trying to reopen the app the next time I logged in.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W397O.png" alt="Log Out dialog"  <answer55352> I suspect you are connecting to a legacy file server as described in the kbase article below.   http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4700  We saw similar pop ups but clearing up our mounts addressed the issue.   <comment29070> Did you set up a shortcut to automatically mount the drive? Looking in System Preferences  Users and Groups  Login Items. Or, is there an application/document that's automatically loaded on launch that points to the iMac? <comment29075> @ChrisAnderson: No, nothing that I can see. Is there any way to detect *which* application is responsible for connecting? <comment29077> Nothing specific that I know of. I'd just check the Console if you haven't already, possibly you can find the error there. <comment175557> Good answer. But one pro tip: If something like this happens again, use `lsof` from `Terminal`. That is a Unix tool to show you the list of open processes. And if you run it like this `sudo lsof | grep Slate` the output of `lsof` gets filtered through `grep` and you could then see exactly what application/process. Is attempting to use `Slate`. <comment203873> I had exactly the same problem, with my new Macbook continuously attempting to reconnect with my old Macbook which I had at one time connected to through the same wifi network. A similar alert would appear on my screen once every few minutes or so. I followed the above directions as far as "Looking in System Preferences  Users and Groups  Login Items." Then I clicked the lock icon in the bottom left corner of the window and entered my password to enable changes. I then clicked on the Guest User icon which appeared directly under my Admin Icon. In the new window I clicked to disable "Allow gu <comment203874> I managed to eliminate it by adding a folder from the named server to the "login items" and then deleting it. Weird, but it worked for me. Hope it helps. <comment203875> I found a similar issue with teacher computers trying to connect to an obsolete server. I found the auto-connect file(s) in MacintoshHD/Users/Shared. Then I deleted them. Problem gone! <comment203876> But how did you find the auto-connect files, Marie? <comment203877> I had this problem as well; at login my Mac (iMac running 10.7) was trying to connect to an old Windows Home Server that I have removed. I found that there was a .../Login Items entry that was trying to mount a volume from that old server. Deleting that entry solved the problem. Thanks for the tip. <comment357563> Good idea, in my case (6 years later) does not apply.
