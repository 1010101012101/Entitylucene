My MacBook won't update <body> My mom gave me her old Mac.  It kept logging-in and texting from her iCloud account.  It would stay logged-in unless I went and logged on the guest account and then logged off.  After that I would log into my account.  I looked up how to do a complete wipe/reset of the Mac.  I was kind of confused so I just wiped everything which also wiped the start-up disk.   I looked-up how to fix that and, based on that, I re-downloaded and installed OSX Lion. When it restarted, it restarted to a earlier version, rather than the one it was on before I did the reset.    I tried to simply update the computer and it wouldn't let me. I finally called Apple Support and they said it was impossible to update it because of the version.  That's surprising because it was fine embefore the factory reset/em.   How can I update the Mac to the latest version it will take?  The MacBook is version 10.7.5, 1983-2012, 13-inch, Mid 2010.  <comment348616> Could you describe exactly how you are attempting to update the OS, and what the error message or response is when you do? 10.7.5 was the last version of [Lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Lion) released; higher versions would be OS upgrades downloaded from the Mac App Store.
