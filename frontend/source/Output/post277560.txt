Unlock or Restore iPad Pro without using iTunes <body> I am totally unfamiliar with Apple products, but my sister passed away last year and she had an iPad Pro 9.7-inch.  I do not have the password but would like to unlock it or do a restore.  I do not know her credentials for iCloud either.    I am aware that I may be able to use iTunes to perform a restore.  After installing on my PC, it will not open.  I would rather not deal with fixing this install.    Is there any way that I can accomplish this without using iTunes?   <comment349346> If the [Activation Lock](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/114985/86317) / findmyiphone findmyipad etc is turned on iTunes may not even help. <comment349348> Is there some manual way to restore like the old iPodsâ€‹ could be manipulated to do?  Or third party software that is legitimate?
