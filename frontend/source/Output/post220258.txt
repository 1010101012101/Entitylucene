Error: The application “NoMachine.app” is not open anymore <body> Every once in a while I'm unable to open the NoMachine client. If I double click, I just get the error:     The application “NoMachine.app” is not open anymore.   And nothing in the console.  If I try clicking on one of my usual connections using the top, menu-bar icon --- nothing happens.  <answer220529> If you're using 10.11, check this out:     A crash occurs when executing a call to network API on OS X 10.11 El Capitan      Based on the Diagnostic Report, the crash occurred during the discovering of other computers on the network and it's related to a call to network API.      As a temporary solution, disabling the 'Discovering of other computers on the network' in player.cfg helped, but this is not a fix and we cannot exclude that the crash appears again. There can be other situations in which a call to the same API can be executed.      Workaround:      ul   liEdit the player.cfg file in the .nx/config directory under the user's home (~/.nx/config) on the client computer./li   liSet:  precode&lt;option key="Discover other NoMachine servers in the network" value="false" /&gt; /code/pre/li   /ul   The workaround in that page helped me. Some weeks ago they've also sent me a test library fixing the issue (I've reported the problem on their forums). You may get in touch with them or wait for an official fix.  <comment266985> Thanks!  Naively, I don't see how these issues are connected...  were you getting the same errors as I am in this situation?
