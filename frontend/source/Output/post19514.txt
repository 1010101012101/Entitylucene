Getting "not eligible to build" error when updating iPad 2 to 4.3.3 <body> I'm trying to update my iPad 2 firmware to 4.3.3 but iTunes is giving me a "not eligible to build" error. I have tried editing my host files, but to no avail.  <answer19516> ol liDownload 4.3.5 instead/li liUpdate your Java by going to software update.
