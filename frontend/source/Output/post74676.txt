VPN Changes Hostname <body> When I connect to various VPN servers (Windows PPTP, Cisco IPSEC) the hostname of my laptop gets updated.  Is there a setting somewhere that will stop this from happening?  <answer74678> The VPN's DNS server probably assigns hostname together with the IP address and the computer uses it instead of what you've set during setup and what appears in System Preferences - Sharing - Computer name.   To set a permanent hostname do  codesudo scutil --set HostName DesiredHostname/code in Terminal.app (there are also ComputerName and LocalHostName that can be changed there).  You can still* set it in code/etc/hostconfig/code, by adding  codeHOSTNAME=DesiredHostname/code at the bottom of the file.  (*I am using this, but it may be depreciated at some point as the beginning of that file says code# This file is going away/code).  Restart may be required in either case.
