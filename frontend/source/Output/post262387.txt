How to remove email address from an old Jabber account <body> When I first got my iMac about 4 years or so ago, I created a Jabber account for messaging, however I never used it.  The email I used to sign up I now wish to associate with my iCloud account, however when I try and do so, it throws an error saying that this email is in use. Jabber is the only place I used that email address.  So is there a way for me to free that email address from the Jabber system so I can associate it on my iCloud?  Thanks for any info, I've done a lot of looking but can't find anything concrete on how to do this.  The email address I wish to use is my custom Gmail address (email @ my domain), when I look in the messaging accounts section it seems this email address is linked to Google Talk which is inactive and has an account type of Jabber.  <comment328741> You might try iforgot.apple.com as it sounds like it's already an appleId <comment328754> Nope, not an apple ID, already tried that one @Tyson
