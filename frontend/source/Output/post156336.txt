How to set specific startup routines? <body> Another simple question for those keeping track, but I was wondering how and where I could setup the startup routines for my mac. What I would really like is for email to open, messages and activity monitor to open but not in a new window, and for safari to open in fullscreen mode in a separate pane. Is this possible or at least where might I look? I'm less interested in accomplishing this as learning some of the more behind the scenes stuff related to the operating system.  <answer201603> Open system references and go to the accounts or users section.   Add these things to each user's startup items.   <comment243063> Depends on how complex you want it go, simple things such as opening App can done as @bmike mentioned from Start Up Items. If you want more complex things like opening Safari in full screen, or running some script can be accomplished with Launch Agents.
