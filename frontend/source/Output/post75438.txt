What is the Reconversion Key in 10.7.5? <body> On Japanese keyboards, there is a Reconversion key beside the space bar, which when highlighting some Kanji in Japanese will allow you to convert it to different Kanji (shows a dropdown of options). Apparently this was at one point ctrl+1, or ctrl+2, but neither work for me now. Ideas?     There are some differences between MacOS 10.1 and MacOS 10.2 for "Reconversion"    in Japanese IME pencel menu and short-cut keys, e.g. the correct short-cut for    JA "Reconversion" on MacOS 10.2 should be "Control + 2", but not "Control + 1"    on MacOS 10.1. "Control + 1" on MacOS 10.2 is assigned to a different function    other than "Reconversion".   <answer75439> It's the same as Reverse Conversion (⌃⇧R).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeXQh.png" alt=""  You can use KeyRemap4MacBook to get a separate 変換 key.  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt; &lt;item&gt; &lt;name&gt;henkan&lt;/name&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;private.henkan&lt;/identifier&gt; &lt;inputmode_only&gt;JAPANESE&lt;/inputmode_only&gt; &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::COMMAND_R, KeyCode::R, ModifierFlag::SHIFT_L | ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre
