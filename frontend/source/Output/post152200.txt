Right side click on track pad issue <body> I am facing a strange issue with my track pad. My machine is a MacBook Pro Retina Display (Mid 2012) updated with Yosemite. So when i click on the track pad's right side, the track pad clicked down properly but nothing happens, although the left side is working properly.  <answer152201> What if you click while holding two fingers on the track pad?  If that works then it might just be the setting: from System Preferences, Trackpad, you're looking for the setting pictured in the following screenshot.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hWVad.jpg" alt="trackpad right click"  (Screenshot courtesy of wikihow.com)
