How to clean uninstall Adobe Acrobat Reader DC? <body> Having to fill a government document I was suggested to install the last version of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC on my Mac (10.10.4).  I downloaded version 2015.009.20069 from Adobe server.  This software crashed 3 times on very basic PDF documents. I didn't find anyway to print a document. My root umask is code022/code and nonetheless, this software installed in code/Applications/code with a mode of code775/code which is a plain violation of my security settings.  Hence I would like to uninstall it. Unfortunatly, there is no uninstaller included with the package installer.  I thought this is because this software was a basic install of just code/Applications/Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.app/code. Just to be sure, I made a fast find of all files arrived on my Mac at the same time and discovered strong2083/strong of them within:  precode/Library/Application Support /Library/LaunchDaemons /Library/Preferences /Library/PriviledgedHelperTools ${HOME}/Library/Application Support ${HOME}/Library/Preferences /code/pre  This isn't exactly what one can name a clean and simple install. hr Is there any strongcomplete/strong and strongsimple/strong uninstaller of this piece of [censored] software?  <answer231800> I didn't find any professionnal answer on the Adobe server. Hence I had to make it.  Here is the shell script I wrote with the help of another tool: Find all files modified around a known one and which I fully tested after an unwanted install (on Yosemite 10.10.4).  Of course, this shell has to be run as coderoot/code. This is why I added the codeset -ex/code to check exactly which command is executed and to exit in the case of any error.  precode#!/bin/sh  # shell script to clean all files created or modified  # during the install of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC  # exit on error and echo commands  set -ex  # check if a directory is empty is_empty() { [ -z `find $1/. ! -name . -print -prune | head -1` ] ; }  # rm left empty dir rm_ifempty() {         if is_empty $1 ; then                 rm -rf $1         else                 echo $1 not empty         fi ; }  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # stop and remove daemons  cd /Library/LaunchDaemons  launchctl unload com.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist rm -f com.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist  launchctl unload com.adobe.ARMDC.SMJobBlessHelper.plist rm -f com.adobe.ARMDC.SMJobBlessHelper.plist  cd /Library/LaunchAgents launchctl unload com.adobe.ARMDCHelper.*.plist rm -f com.adobe.ARMDCHelper.*.plist  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # remove the application  cd /Applications rm -rf Adobe\ Acrobat\ Reader\ DC.app   # remove system wide preferences  cd /Library/Preferences rm -f com.adobe.reader.DC.WebResource.plist  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # remove all Application dependant ressources  cd /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe rm -rf ARMDC rm -rf ARMNext rm -rf HelpCfg rm -rf Reader/DC  # Reader/11.0 should be kept # if Reader directory is empty remove it  rm_ifempty Reader  cd /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ rm -rf AdobePDFViewer.plugin rm -rf AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin  cd /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools rm -f com.adobe.ARMDC.*  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # remove HOME dependant ressources  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe rm -rf AcroCef rm -rf Acrobat/DC   # Acrobat/other_versions shoud be kept # if Acrobat directory is empty remove it  rm_ifempty Acrobat  rm -rf Linguistics  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support rm -rf CEF  # crash dumps cd ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports rm -rf AdobeReader_*.crash  cd ~/Library/Preferences rm com.adobe.AdobeRdrCEF.plist  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------- # remove receipts files  cd /private/var/db/receipts rm com.adobe.RdrServicesUpdater.* rm com.adobe.acrobat.DC.* rm com.adobe.armdc.* /code/pre  <answer231811> There is a much easier way to Uninstall applications.  Macworld.com had written about a product from FreeSoftMac called App Cleaner that does exactly this type of uninstall.  You can also have a look at this similar question:  How to Uninstall Qt in El Capitan?  I don't have Adobe installed on my Mac at this time, but I do have software that installed Launch Daemons - Disk Drill - which I am going to uninstall because I am finished with my drive recovery.  Below is a screen capture of what it finds and will remove from the system; the arrow points to the Launch Daemon associated with Disk Drill.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/odAVq.png" alt="DiskDrill Screen Shot"  <answer261064> I think this will work; about to try it now.  I have used CleanMyMac through multiple versions; just installed CMM3 on my new Sierra-running MacbookPro; it does complete uninstalls of programs/applications, so I imagine it will work for Reader.  Now all I ahve to do is find Reader 11!  (or move it from back-up disk, I guess)  <comment268329> Have a look at: [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) <comment285167> This seems very thorough. Thanks for this! <comment310964> I tested it on a case of a software which installed like a herd of pigs: `Foxit` (Many installed directories with mode `777` ). I tested `App Cleaner`.•• return ••This little app is a pretty nice piece of work! <comment310968> Now I fully understand why Adobe never wrote a clean uninstaller for their different versions of Adobe Readers ! <comment353748> App Cleaner is a great program, but it's not up to cleaning the mess Adobe makes. Specifically, it doesn't remove the files from `/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/Library/LaunchDaemons`, and `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools`. I know because I just tried it and those files were all still there. <comment359548> @SSteve: [ad] my script does it :). <comment360332> worked fine for me, except that I didn't have a `com.adobe.AdobeRdrCEF.plist`. Instead I had: ```com.adobe.AdobeRdrCEFHelper.plist com.adobe.Reader.plist com.adobe.crashreporter.plist ``` Maybe the should be updated to use the `-f` option. Many thanks anyway.
