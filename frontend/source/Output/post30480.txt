How can I exit "bash"? <body> I don't know how to get my code.profile/code aliases back in to the terminal every time I try them, this error massage comes up:  precodeapaw:~ apaw$ cdp -bash: cdp: command not found /code/pre  How do i exit this -bash? I strongly believe it was named different while it still worked.  <answer30484> I'm not sure I understand your question.    The code-bash:/code prefix you see is simply bash's way of identifying itself as the source of the error message. In this case you entered codecdp/code which is neither an external nor internal shell command nor was it defined as an alias or function.  While in a (bash) terminal, you can simply type codeexit/code to leave the terminal and close the shell session.  The aliases in your code.profile/code are read when you start a new terminal or shell session, or if you codesource/code the files: e.g. codesource ~/.profile/code.  That should re-read your code.profile/code and load any changed aliases.  <answer30593> Okay, I've found out what the problem was, some script has created a code.bash_profile/code file that was overriding my code.profile/code file, now I've removed the code.bash_profile/code file and it works again!  <comment35286> I recommend using .bash_profile instead of .profile, especially if it contains any bash-specific code. Also, if you're not already doing it this way: you should generally place customizations in .bashrc and have .bash_profile source .bashrc. .bashrc applies to login and non-login shells, but .profile (and .bash_profile) only apply to login shells.
