MySQL not working on mountain lion <body> I'm using mountain lion, I have installed MySQL.   GUI  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3F3yf.jpg" alt="mysql server"  It shows MySQL is running, but when I type   precodemysql --version  /code/pre  It gives error strong"mysql: command not found"/strong  <answer99001> codecommand not found/code just means that the executable you're trying to run is not found in any of the directories in your $PATH environment variable.  Try code/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql/code  The documentation links include a platform guide where it tells you that MySQL gets installed into /usr/local/, and then a symlink is created at code/usr/local/mysql/code that points to this install dir. Here you can see that I've installed two versions, and that symlink was updated on the last install:  precode$ ls -ld /usr/local/mysql* lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   27 Apr  4  2012 /usr/local/mysql -&gt; mysql-5.5.22-osx10.6-x86_64 drwxr-xr-x   3 root  wheel  102 Apr  4  2012 /usr/local/mysql-5.5.18-osx10.6-x86_64 drwxr-xr-x  16 root  wheel  544 Mar  2  2012 /usr/local/mysql-5.5.22-osx10.6-x86_64 /code/pre  I don't recall what change I made to put /usr/local/mysql/bin into my PATH, but in my opinion, the cleanest way to do that for all users is  precodesudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/mysql/bin &gt; /etc/paths.d/mysql' /code/pre  and open a new tab in Terminal to get the effect immediately.  <answer99132> precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH" /code/pre  in .bashrc or .bash_profile file (cd ~/.bash_profile)  This will tell your terminal where to find mysql command.  <comment116332> Post the solution as an answer and mark the answer as the correct one. :)
