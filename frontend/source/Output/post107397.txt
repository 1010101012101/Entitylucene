Safari 7 User Agent is set to “Custom” by default <body> Ever since upgrading to Mavericks from Snow Leopard, Safari’s default User Agent is set to custom. Anybody has any idea why this happens? And how can I fix it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hERkc.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer107589> I managed to fix it by deleting the codeCustomUserAgent/code string in the plist file.  precodedefaults delete com.apple.Safari CustomUserAgent /code/pre  But I still don’t understand how it got to be like that in the first place.  <answer174661> This happens after you use codedefaults write com.apple.Safari CustomUserAgent "\"My user agent string\""/code command. Either your or someone who used your computer wanted to add a permanent user agent string to the browser. It not only adds the string permanently but also setting it to the default string. You can add a new string to overwrite it as well.  <comment125930> Do you have activated the developer menu? Do you see a menu "Develop" in your menu bar if safari is active? If so, what did you have chosen as User Agent in that menu? <comment125931> Yes, I do, and the default User Agent is “Custom”. Every time I start Safari, it chooses “Custom”. <comment125932> Did I understand that correctly: If you chose Default now, then restart Safari, the User Agent resets to "Custom"? That is not intended, normally it should always reset to "Default"(That's why it's called default") <comment125934> @napcae, you understood correctly. <comment184847> This bothered me for the longest time. It could be that I once changed as instructed by coursera. Not 100% sure.
