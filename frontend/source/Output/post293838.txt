Update macOS 10.12.6 breaks Fusion Drive <body> A few days ago I launched the 10.12.6 update, but it got stuck at the end of the reboot phase, with the black bar full.  I tried forcing a reboot on verbose mode, it got stuck on  precodeSmartBattery: finished polling type 4. /code/pre  I checked Disk Utility in recovery mode and the Fusion Drive was gone, I had two separated drives. I rebuilt the Fusion Drive and restored from a Time Machine backup, retried the update with the same result. I found some threads online about macs stuck on Smartbattery, but nothing regarding broken Fusion Drives.  I have a Mac Book Pro 15", mid 2012, Fusion Drive homemade that worked perfectly for a couple of years now. Any advice on how to successfully update the OS?
