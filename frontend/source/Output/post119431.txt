Updating a chart dynamically in Numbers <body> strongBackground:/strong I've been having some sleep issues so I have started tracking my sleep habits along with some other data but so far, they are just entries in Evernote and as such it is not possible to see any patterns. Obviously I need a spreadsheet app with charting capabilities (doh!). I've been using a great iPhone app called Sleepbot for data collection for sleep times and then enter those into Evernote.  I have the iWork set so I have been looking at Numbers and going through some tutorials but I still can't tell if it will do what I want. Given that my data set will increase daily, I'd like to be able to "page through" a chart/data set, so it shows say the last 30 data entries. With all the tutorials I have seen, the charts are of fixed size and adding more data to a linked table just causes the chart to cram more stuff in.  Can Numbers do this sort of "paging" of data? I would like to have this sort of "on the fly" charting rather than having to explicitly build a chart each time I want to visualize the data.   em(sorry the question is rather garbled: I don't know really anything about using a spreadsheet type app)/em  <answer119456> To save on the cramming part of the Chart you could try using an interactive Chart with a scroll bar.  1, Start a new sheet and fill it with your data:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mqIM8.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  2, Go to the Chart menu and select Interactive Chart &amp; the style you want.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4wzUY.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have chosen the simplest. Others you may have to play more with.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qr1mh.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  3, Click the Chart and then it's  strongAdd Chart Data/strong button.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VVTJt.png" alt="enter image description here"   hr  4, select either rows by clicking on each strongday of week/strong row.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkidE.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/av78r.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  4.1 Or Columns by clicking on the strongWEEK/strong columns  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aRbt2.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x7NHr.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  5, Click the DONE button at the bottom of the page when you have completed your selection.  If you need to remove/add a column or row from the Chart data. Then Click the Chart. And then the strongEdit Chart Data/strong button.  Adding is the same as you did before.  Removing is clicking on the row or column and hitting the delete/backspace key. this does not remove the eta from the sheet only from the chart.  hr  The chart I chose has a scroll bar which you can scroll through.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2EqnI.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BYee5.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  You can change the text size by using the format palettes.  And you can add labels to the Chart columns   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DslsE.png" alt="enter image description here"  by using  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gl9n7.png" alt="enter image description here"  If I figure how to make it pick up the sheet info by it's self I will update.  <comment139325> That's a lot of effort, thanks for putting something together - I hope it helps :) <comment139336> Hey thanks for taking the time to put that together! After I saw it I went off to search on interactive charts and came across this Lynda.com "info-torial" (http://www.lynda.com/iCloud-tutorials/Interactive-charts/154910/159604-4.html). It looks like what I need, though I'd prefer line rather than scatter charts - but it is something to work with. Cheers!
