Create an automator/applescript service that opens a file in an external program <body> h2Just wondering about some automator/applescript help./h2  Basically: I download a MP3 file from an artist (for example)  It is saved to my Downloads folder.  From there, I want to open it automatically in an external MP3 tag editor such as this one.  Then, I will edit the tags and save the file.  When the file is saved, I want to have the newly edited MP3 moved to a folder (my iTunes "Add Automatically" folder, codeMacintosh HD ▸ Users ▸ Steve ▸ Music ▸ iTunes ▸ iTunes Media ▸ Add Automatically to iTunes/code.  Currently I have an Automator workflow that codeFilter Finder Items/code and codeMove Finder Items/code the mp3 into the iTunes folder, but I want to be able to edit the tags first. Here is a picture of what I have set up right now.  Any ideas?  <answer142683> Use "Open Finder items" and choose a program from the drop-down list. An example from one of my workflows:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VLMP.png" alt="action example"  <answer142685> OK, so I figured it out on my own.  I used ID3 Editor instead of kid3.  My workflow consists of:  Filter items (Music)  Open in ID3 editor  Ask for confirmation ("click ok if you are ready")  Move finder files  Thanks for assistance Rilakkuma!  <comment168080> But can the file then be moved into a folder AFTER it is saved with an external IDE tag editor?
