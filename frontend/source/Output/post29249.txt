How can I restore my iPad from iOS 5 to iOS 4? <body> I updated my iPad from iOS 4 to iOS 5 yesterday, without making any backup. However, I  found that it is not convenient for me to debug my programs. So I want to restore it to iOS 4 again.   I did as follows:  ol liDownloaded iOS 4.3.3/li liDownloaded iTunes 10.4 to replace 10.5/li liConnected iPad with my PC/li liFirst, I click the on/off button for seconds and then keep clicking the on/off button and home button for about 10 seconds. At last, I keep clicking the home button only for about 15 seconds. iTunes detected my iPad in restore mode./li liFollowing the tips of iTunes, I clicked "Option" and "Restore" button to choose the Firmware I downloaded and tried to restore my iPad./li /ol  However, something is wrong here. The error is:     emstrongthis device isn't eligible for the requested build/em/strong   Can anyone give me an idea?  <answer29255> iTunes will not willingly load a lower iOS onto a device. Have you looked into the tiny umbrella program to see alternate methods to trick iTunes into doing what you wish.   iOS 4 requires an shsh key to sign the 4.3.3 package for your specific device. emThis key normally comes from the itunes actication servers./em Unless you have already saved that key, the automation tools won't work and you'll have to do muh deeper hacking to crack this nut.   hr  tl;dr   ul liread up on jail breaking/li liit might be too late for you to go back easily/li /ul  <answer243031> If you see this isn't eligible for the requested build this means  that Apple has stopped signing the 4.3.3 update. Sorry.
