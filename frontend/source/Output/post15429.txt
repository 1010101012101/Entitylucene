Printing current date and time on each page <body> I'm often printing several versions of a document (e.g. a paper in progress). To keep track of the printouts I would like to print the date and time of printing onto emeach page/em, regardless of which application I'm using (although it would be okay if it works for PDF files only, if it happens automatically). I have seen Windows printer drivers including this feature, but haven't found any settings here (e.g., Canon iR3225) nor any hidden-CUPS-feature-I-could-activate-in-the-config-file.  Any ideas? Some sort of preprocessing I could inject into cups?  (I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.7)  <answer15473> Perhaps use a PDF modification tool like codePdftk/code to add a watermark that contains the desired metadata.  <answer26279> I finally found a usable solution using convert from ImageMagick, the PDF services mentioned by nathang and Automator.   ol liStart Automator, create a new "Print Plugin"/li liDrag the "run shell script" action to the right and enter the following script:  precodeexport PATH=/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH convert -size 400x50 xc:white -font Arial -pointsize 24 -gravity center -draw "fill grey50 text 0,0 '`/bin/date`'" /tmp/stamp.png cat /code/pre/li liAdd the "Watermark PDF Documents" action and add the file "/tmp/stamp.png" using the 'add...' button. (You probably have to create this file first, e.g. using codetouch /tmp/stamp.png/code in a Terminal). Then adjust the offset, scale and opacity as you like. I'm using x=480 y=820 scale=0.25 opacity=0.7. /li liAdd the "Open Images in Preview" action. /li liSave the Automator script. /li /ol  Now you should find a new action in the "PDF" drop-down menu of your printing dialog, which stamps the current date and time on each page and shows the result in Preview, from where you can print the document.  <comment16805> I know about `pdftk`, and probably it's possible using it to write some script adding my timestamp to each page. But this does not solve the integration problem into the printing system -- the solution is sort of unusable if I have to go to the console pre-processing every PDF file I want to print. <comment16855> How about integrating this with AppleScript? <comment18620> Integrating into the system is the easy part, thanks to [PDF services](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2004122222145585) <comment252920> Your link is a 404. If you still have the script, can you re-upload it? <comment253241> @grgarside Sorry I don't have the file any longer as I reinstalled my mac several times since then. But you can create it yourself using the description above.
