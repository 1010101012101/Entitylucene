How to Change Scroll Speed Programmatically with Applescript or Shell Script <body> Is there a way, using either applescript or a shell script, to change the scroll speed? I don't even know where to begin to look for a mechanism for this.  Oh, and no third-party applications either, just plain vanilla applescript/shell script so as to be completely portable and should be able to function on Mac OS 10.6 - 10.10.  <answer181369> Terminal:  precodedefaults write -g com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling -float 1.0 /code/pre  And log-out/log-in. code1.0/code is just a guess. Maybe also try code1.5/code. This is a hidden preference so default value is not known. Fiddle around a bit to find the speed to like. If it doesn't work, or you wish to restore to back to how it used to be:  precodedefaults delete -g com.apple.scrollwheel.scaling /code/pre
