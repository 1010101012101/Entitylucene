Use Mac Sleepimage <body> I need to access a Pages document I lost that was open in my last "sleepimage" (3 days old) file. How can I use/open this file to access what is in it aka the content I lost ..?  Thank you so much in advance for the help!  Using Mac OS 10.7.5  <answer103722> Unfortunately the sleep image is of little use to you.  This is technically the complete memory registers dumped to a signed encrypted file. Reverse engineering a document from this raw fragmented data is extremely unlikely; there is no filesystem here to browse as it where.  You may have more success taking a look at your iCloud raw content?  https://developer.icloud.com  <comment121955> Which Mac are you using? <comment121956> Macbook Air 13in from Mid 2011, OS 10.7.5 <comment121965> If it was 3 days ago I am afraid it is lost (overwritten) <comment122002> What I meant is that that is the sleepimage i have and it is the one I want to use - I can see the file and the timestamp on it; I just have no idea how to open it ... <comment122028> Do you use Time Machine or have it on in System Preferences? <comment122251> I don't use Time Machine, it is on system preference; I wish I was using Time Machine; the recovery would have been so much easier :(
