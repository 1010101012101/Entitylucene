iPhoto won't open <body> When I tried to open iPhoto, it says that I needed to update to the latest version.  Im using OS X Yosemite system.   When I search on App Store it says that "emThe item you've requested is not currently available/em".  <answer181752> iPhoto emand Aperture/em are not supported any more and have been removed from the app store.  From wikipedia (here):      On April 8, 2015, Apple released OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, which includes the new Photos app. iPhoto and Aperture were discontinued and removed from the Mac App Store.   The successor app strongPhotos/strong was just released – on the corresponding page at apple.com you'll find further information about this release.  <answer181831> I just went through this with a friend of mine. We found and installed iPhoto from the App Store under Purchases.  <answer194084> 1) Launch the terminal (don't be afraid, type "terminal" on spotlight or in /Application/Utilities/Terminal(.app)  2) type : /Applications/iPhoto.app/Contents/MacOS/iPhoto  Found this at  http://www.simplehelp.net/2015/05/01/how-to-install-iphoto-in-yosemite-os-x-10-10/
