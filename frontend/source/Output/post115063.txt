Why are the terminal color brighter than the ones I set? <body> I've changed my terminal's color but, as always, the color I set are rendered brighter than they really are.  Here's the proof, I set the exact same color on ST and on my term, you can clearly see the term is brighter.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mMCZP.png" alt="enter image description here"  Any clue why ?  <answer115180> Try changing the color profile to the profile used by your display before specifying the values:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nZU1O.png" alt=""  <answer196764> In order to get the foreground behave as it should, the background needs to be explicitly declared with LSCOLOR (gnu) or LS_COLOR (linux).   The trick is to use the same color both for your ANSI palette background color and in your Terminal window non-ANSI setup.  I don't know why, but it works.  <comment136001> Oh, that was it. Thanks :)
