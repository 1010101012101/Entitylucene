Hide files/icons on the desktop but not in finder <body> Not sure if something like this exists in OSX. I would like to display a cheatsheet on my desktop as a wallpaper and to make it visible at all times I would like to hide all the icons/files/folders scattered on my desktop as I'm accessing them only from within the Finder anyway. So my question is if it is possible to hide everything on the desktop and show the wallpaper only but use the Desktop folder as normal and see all the files and folders when in Finder view? Using OSX Mountain Lion.  <answer79688> I don't believe you can hide files from the desktop while leaving them viewable from within the Finder, since the desktop is just a folder (code~/Desktop/code).  However, here's an alternative that could work:  ol liOpen your cheatsheet image in Safari (drag and drop the image onto the Safari icon in the dock)/li liIn Safari, go to File  Open in Dashboard.../li liYour image should be selected/highlighted, or if not, then click it to select it. Click Add in the purple toolbar./li /ol  This will create a Dashboard widget that displays your image. Now to view the image, simply toggle Dashboard (kbdF4/kbd on a newer Mac or kbdF12/kbd on an older one).  hr  Another alternative: if you're not accessing your files from the desktop, why keep them in the code~/Desktop/code folder at all? Just move them to another folder.  <answer79689> You could try using a program called camouflage. It hides all the icons on your desktop. There are older versions available online that may or may not work with Mountain Lion, but it is also available on the Mac App Store, which will work with Mountain Lion  Version 1.25 (free - softonic.com) Free, but it may or may not work on Mountain Lion  Version 2.2.1 ($5.99 - Mac App Store) Will definitely work on Mountain Lion  Edit: if you wanted this quick switch functionality, you could write 2 little bash scripts from the top answer and put them in an Automator action and set it to sit in the top bar  <answer79725> Another great piece and strongfree/strong piece of software for doing this is strongXtraFinder/strong.  http://www.trankynam.com/xtrafinder/  It can also add to Finder very interesting options like:  ul likbdCMD-X/kbd for Cut &amp; Paste/li liCreate new file (with your favorite templates)/li liArrange folders on top/li liQuickly show/hide hidden files with a shortcut/li liTabs/li /ul  All can be individually enabled.  In the various shortcuts you'll find strongHide Desktop/strong that is what you need.  I currently use strongXtraFinder/strong on ML without issues. It's really light for the OS.  <answer91226> There's another little emfree/em program that does exactly this, and nothing more:  http://blog.websecurify.com/2013/01/hide-desktop-icons-on-mac-os-x.html  It sits in the menu bar and lets you toggle icons on or off.  <answer91227> I'm not sure if this exactly meets your criteria, but Desktop Curtain from Many Tricks is a neat app that hides your messy desktop. $5 in the Mac App Store.   <answer113917> You can run the following Terminal command:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false &amp;&amp; killall -HUP Finder /code/pre  supTo undo, replace codefalse/code with codetrue/code./sup  Source: OS X Daily: Hide All Desktop Icons â€” No idea if it is Mavericks only.  <answer120328> strongIn the terminal, do this:/strong  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  After this, there'll be nothing on your Desktop (but still in code~/Desktop/code, i.e. your Desktop Folder). It'll look like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3FcxU.jpg" alt="Clean Desktop"  hr  Beautiful, isn't it? strongIf you want to change it back:/strong  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true &amp;&amp; killall Finder /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/X3PeB.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment91996> This is great! Haven't realized I could do that. Thx of sharing. <comment107129> What kind of cheat sheet? <comment121188> Yes, this does exactly what the OP requested. Great resource. <comment138424> I just had a small drag incident that caused just what you wanted, but i have no idea how to swich back to show on the desktop. <comment138502> Great, works with Mavericks! <comment164315> Thanks Sheharyar- works great. Turned it into an Alfred workflow so I can just hide and show when I want. <comment164403> @VLostBoy Nice! <comment362214> Great! But... what if I just want to get rid of files n hidden files but still would like to see Disks and External Drives and optical Media? Is there a way to allow the connected drives while hiding files?
