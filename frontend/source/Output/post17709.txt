How to remove one old python installation from a system with multiple (non-system) installations of python <body> h1Disclaimer/h1  First, let me get the obvious out of the way: strongI have not touched the system-bundled Python./strong  I know it’s important to leave it alone.  I have, in fact, done exactly that. ☺   hr  h1Background/h1  The Python official releases for Mac have a very handy Installer.  (It’s the Installer’s brilliance that allowed me to put newer versions of Python on my system without screwing up the system-bundled version.  Thanks, Pythonistas!)    Now, my primary Python installation is 2.7.  Since it is the last 2.x release, that’s fine.  However, I was curious to learn about Python 3 as well, so I installed it.  And it plays perfectly nicely with Python 2.  In fact, Python 3 is opt-in, which is just what I wanted.  “Works as advertised.”  h1Now, the weird part…/h1  I have 2 installed versions of Python 3!  The installers for Python 3.1 and Python 3.2 both installed to separate locations.  So, now I have Python 3.1 hanging around and I’m never planning to use it.  And since the installer is awesome (I’m not being sarcastic; I’m really impressed, especially since most programming languages require compilation from source), it also creates entries in /Applications with some handy utilities.    But since I have installed a newer Python 2 and two versions of Python 3, this means I now have:  ul listrong/Applications/Python 2.7/strong,/li listrong/Applications/Python 3.1/strong, emand/em /li listrong/Applications/Python 3.2/strong/li /ul  h1Help Wanted!/h1  I just want to ditch Python 3.1.    And I want to be very thorough about it.  No forgotten directories buried under strong/Library/*/strong (or whatever).    Anybody know how to do this?  <answer17722> From python docs noting that they seem to have hard coded 2.5 instead of the current version and is not that well written     What you get after installing is a number of things:      A MacPython 2.5 folder in your Applications folder. In here you find   IDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of official   Python distributions; PythonLauncher, which handles double-clicking   Python scripts from the Finder; and the “Build Applet” tool, which   allows you to package Python scripts as standalone applications on   your system.      A framework /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework, which   includes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this   location to your shell path. To uninstall MacPython, you can simply   remove these three things. A symlink to the Python executable is   placed in /usr/local/bin/.   so remove   precode/Applications/Python 3.1 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.1 /usr/local/bin/python31 (I use a different install so this might be python3.1 or similar) /code/pre  <comment19392> You should check the installation script for python 3.1 and build an installation file-list. After this do this for the python 3.2 too (you don't want remove files common to both versions.).
