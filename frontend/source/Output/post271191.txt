Airport Extreme - USB Disk as network disk for Windows and Mac, what format? <body> I want to share a USB disk via Airport Extreme as a network disk for our Mac and Windows environment. To read and write on the disk, I've set it up as FAT32 (max 4GB files) and I can connect with it with all computers.   The problem is now, when I add a file / folder.. it's being displayed for 2 seconds and it hides itself (as it doesn't exist).   So, how should I format the USB disk so I can use it as network disk and write / read stuff on it?  <answer271210> I don't know, why the files hide itself, but FAT-32 is a non journaling file system which means it has a difficult time keeping track of what is where and is generally more susceptible to file loss and corruption.  You could try the following:  ul liFormat to strongexFAT/strong/li liFormat to strongNTFS/strong, and use NTFS-3G to read/write on Mac/li liFormat to strongHFS+/strong, and use HFS Explorer to read/write on PC/li liCreate two partitions on your hard drive to use with each OS, separately/li /ul  Maybe it will solve your issue. Good luck  <answer271221> From https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202807     Supported formats: Mac OS Extended (HFS-plus), FAT16, FAT32      If HFS+ formatting is used, AFP and Microsoft SMB/CIFS protocols are   used to share the device on the network. If a FAT16/32 format is used,   only SMB/CIFS protocols are used and AFP won't be available.   So if you are using FAT32 and connecting to it from Mac and Windows using SMB it should work fine.  <comment340913> When you say it "hides itself after two seconds" does the folder exist but is hidden?  Does this happen on both Mac and PC? <comment340919> -1 for assuming that FAT32 is inherently more susceptible to file corruption and deemed not reliable while simultaneously adding additional layers of complexity (2 more pieces of software) to do something that's already native in macOS and Windows.
