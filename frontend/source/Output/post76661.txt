Resource efficient way to monitor file change and execute shell scripts on change <body> I know at least three ways to monitor a folder/file for changes and execute a shell script on change.  ul liFirst, use "Folder Actions" of Automator/li liSecond, the launchd.plist approach but it seems the folder been monitored couldn't go through recursively./li liThird, use native FSEvents API on Mac OS X. like the modified fswatch utility/li /ul  My question is that which one cost system resource (CPU or memory) less ?  <comment88907> It's probably safe to assume that the first two rely on the third - all are rather efficient. <comment88923> Folder actions are also limited to a single folder without subfolders. And they are only run when files are added, not when they are modified.
