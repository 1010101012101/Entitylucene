Best way to distribute script with low friction <body> I have helped a few friends recently with fixing a problem on OS X and I would like to turn it in to a script so I can send it to people instead of walking them through it. It consists of two steps:  ul lidelete a file/li lirestart the computer/li /ul  What is the best way to package this so people will be able to execute it with the default security settings on Mountain Lion and Mavericks? AppleScript, Automator, Shell script?  <answer112068> AppleScript is imho the best one for your case. Shell needs codesudo/code for codeshutdown -r/code and automator is overkill for these basic needs.   Here are the 2 basic scripts you'll need :   To reboot :   precodetell application "Finder"   restart end tell /code/pre  To delete a file :  precodetell application "Finder" to delete file "path:to:file" /code/pre  If you want to use a posix path, an alternative to the previous one is   precodetell application "Finder" to delete POSIX path of "/path/to/file" /code/pre  <comment131654> Thank you. What if I need to find the file based on a pattern, something I might normally use `ls` or a regexp for? <comment131655> You can call shell scripts within AppleScript using `do shell script`.
