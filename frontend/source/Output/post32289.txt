OS X Lion multiple Spaces annoyance <body> I like to set my desktops a certain way for work.  I noticed that when I command-tab around my Spaces, it seems to switch around the order of desktops when I access with ctrl+arrow.  This is really annoying. strongFor example/strong I set my two terminal and coding/debugger screens to be adjacent, then I alt-tab to my email and all of a sudden the email screen is sitting between my two work screens.  <answer32295> Did you try checking the obvious?img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZZ1rP.png" alt="Did you try checking the obvious?"
