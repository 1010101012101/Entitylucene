How to tell Timemachine that the Machine Dir has moved? <body> On my Mac, I used Time Machine to backup to a Drobo that was directly attached. I've now connected this Drobo to my TimeCapsule. I however want to continue backing up to the Drobo, not the TimeCapsule.   I have told the TimeCapsule to share its disks, and can mount the Drobo Disk fine, and it appears under code/Volumes/code as "Drobo".  However, when I tell TimeCapsule to use the new disk, it does not recognize the presence of the old backups on the disks. Instead of using the machine directory present it starts a new sparsebundle. This is not what I want.  How do I get Time Machine to continue backing up in the original machine directory?  I've tried  precodetmutil inerhitbackup &lt;machine dir&gt; /code/pre  but this didn't work... Anything else I can do?  <answer104337> I think I have found the answer. The following site was very helpful:  http://pondini.org/TM/18.html  There are important differences between how Time Machine backups to local disks, and tonetworked disks. In the first case the backup goes to a "Backups.backupdb directory, in the second case to a "sparsebundle".   So my solution will be:  ol liFirst have Timemachine start a new back up to my now networked Drobo. /li liInterrupt the backup after the sparsebundle has been made./li linow move the Drobo temporarily back to my Mac, mount the sparse bundle, and use diskutil to erase it./li liCopy the existing back up in to the monted sparsebundle./li liAttach the Drobo again to the Time Capsule once this is finished./li /ol  However I can't try this out yet. First have to expand the disk space on my Drobo. So the first step for me really is: Get two 4TB disks on Monday...
