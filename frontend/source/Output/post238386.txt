Can't create new directory in home folder: What are "default" permissions/ownership? <body> I do know how to set permissions. But what is the default OS X permission and ownership for one's home directory. I can't create a dir. How is mine different?  (See snippet):  precodejbenniMac:~ jbenni$ pwd /Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/jbenni jbenniMac:~ jbenni$ ls -l .. total 0 drwxrwx---@ 101 jbenni  staff  3434 May 14 17:15 jbenni jbenniMac:~ jbenni$ mkdir test mkdir: test: Permission denied jbenniMac:~ jbenni$  /code/pre  Also:  precodejbenniMac:~ jbenni$ ls -ledO@ /Users/jbenni drwxr-xr-x+ 13 jbenni  staff  - 442 Mar  9 15:52 /Users/jbenni  0: group:everyone deny delete /code/pre  Note: 1) There are other miscellaneous symptoms. E.g., Bash complains about not being able to create  a sessions folder, and I get a spurious "StartupItems" has wrong permissions at login (even though it doesn't).  I suspect all these are related.  Note: 2) Long ago, and several versions of OS X ago, I installed an SSD for my system and applications.  I relocated my Home directory (using the Users and Groups, "Advanced Options...", then browsing to a location on the builtin hard disk for my home directory).  That's been working fine, and life is good in the Finder.  I don't use Terminal often enough to know for sure when this prob. started - but Terminal stronghas/strong worked subsequent to the SSD/HDD separation.   <answer238388> Defaults should be coderwxr-xr-x user staff/code  You can reset user defaults from Recovery...  ul liReset Home folder permissions &amp; ACLsbr This has become more complex since El Capitan because of System Integrity Protection, but is still possible by booting to Recovery Mode...    ol liAt boot, hold kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd R /kbd at the chimes/li liAt the recovery screen, open Terminal from the Utilities menu.  /li liType in coderesetpassword/code and hit Return\Enter.

The problem turns out to be caused by conflicting ACLs, and was solved by removing them all. (Apparently coderesetpassword/code as suggested above did not clear these ACLs.  I don't know why.) The terminal command that revealed the conflicting ACLs was:  precodels -ledO@ "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/jbenni" /code/pre  The terminal command that fixed the conflict (by removing all) was:   precodechmod -N "/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Users/jbenni" /code/pre  I hope this helps someone else. I was codechmod/code aware, but didn't have a working knowledge of ACLs - so I never would have found this on my own. Stackexchange rocks!  <comment292344> Neither `/Users` nor the individual home folder are protected by SIP, so why not just run `chmod 755 ~`? And how does this help here anyway, the users seems to have write access to the home folder already (and the only ACL doesn't prevent folder creation by the user either)? <comment292345> What does `id -a` return? Is it just the name `test` which fails or *any* name? What is the result of `touch test`? <comment292348> Onyx can no longer reset them without going through this - so I'm pretty sure it's doing something more than just blanket chmodding everything to 755 [I can't prove it, cos my nix chops are terrible, but if it could be done before SIP & can't be done now, that's my logical conclusion] <comment292349> I just tried, chmod'ing your own home folder works as expected :-) There might be more to this (and it might even solve the OP's problems), but right now it looks a bit like [magic](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/magic.html) to me. <comment292351> @patrix - Have you tried xattr ? It's not something I really want to play with, cos if I break it I will then own two halves  ;-) <comment292352> `xattr` is the same as `ls -l@`, no dice there. And `ls -led ~` gives me the same `0: group:everyone deny delete` ACL as the OP has (which just prevents deletion of the home folder as such). <comment292391> Can't create any directory inside Home without using sudo. touch test returns "Permission denied".  id -a returns the expected list of ids.  The id for jbenni is 504.  mkdir and rm both work with sudo. <comment292393> I did reset the user defaults from Recovery - carefully being sure to exit properly.  No change.  (I didn't actually change the password, just the home folder permissions and ACLs - which appeared to complete properly.) <comment292397> Permissions were not changed after reset defaults. So I manually set to 755 - it now shows 'drwxr-xr-x@ 101 jbenni  staff'.  I still can't create a directory. <comment292422> Ah, note #2 is actually rather important. Which filesystem does the HD have? With which options is it mounted? <comment292463> The HD is "OS X Extended", writeable, not case-sensitive.  It's disk0s4, internal via SATA.  (All disks are "clean" with respect to Disk Util's First Aid.) <comment292595> Nice find. Glad you got it :)
