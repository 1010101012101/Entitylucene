What directory does homebrew use to build programs? <body> I would like to change the directory that homebrew uses when it builds programs  Is that possible? I didn't find such option in brew command  <answer164527> When you install a Homebrew package, if it needs to compile it from source, it will extract the files to code/tmp/package-XXXXXX/code and compile them there before installing to code/usr/local/Cellar/package/code.  You can specify a different temp folder by setting an environment variable...  precodeexport HOMEBREW_TEMP=/Users/USERNAME/Desktop/temp /code/pre  <answer250328> The manpage of Homebrew version 0.9.9 suggest something different:  the default folder Hombrew uses to do his things (including compiling) is code~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/code, and you can change it by setting codeHOMEBREW_CACHE/code environmental variable. The environmental variable can be set by editing the hidden file code.bash_profile/code in the user folder, e.g.:  precodenano ~/.bash_profile /code/pre  then add  precodeexport HOMEBREW_CACHE=/path/to/folder /code/pre  Remember to do a codesource ~/.bash_profile/code to load the new environmental variable in already opened terminal sessions.  Brew manpage about codeHOMEBREW_TEMP/code:  precodeHOMEBREW_TEMP      If set, instructs Homebrew to use HOMEBREW_TEMP as the temporary directory     for building  packages.     This  may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew Prefix are     on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes     when the target does not yet exist.      This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations. /code/pre  Unless this fits your settings, you should avoid setting codeHOMEBREW_TEMP/code.
