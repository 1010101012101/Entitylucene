Why can't Safari open RSS feeds? <body> I'm using Safari 5.1.3 on Lion.  Each time I click the RSS icon in the address bar (or directly visit the feed), Safari will report can't open page, saying operation not permitted with the codeNSPOSIXErrorDomain: 1/code error. For other web sites, Safari works fine.  I have no 3rd party firewall installed on my system. I also tried to disable the firewall in system settings but still getting the same error.  As I use Google Reader, I've once installed the "Add To Google Reader" extension from Apple's site, but it didn't work for me.  <answer40532> Based on the error message, I tried the following command and solved the problem:  precodechown -R username: ~/Library/Safari /code/pre  So I guess there are some files or directories which does not belong to me. It's weird how could this happen because I never touched that directory manually before.  <comment45688> What exact version of safari are you running ? <comment45692> I'm using Safari 5.1.3 on Lion. <comment45800> Can you copy the URL and paste it into Google Reader? <comment45843> Yes. Currently I just copy the URL and paste it into Google Reader. But this error is annoying.
