Upgrade to 10.10.4 does not complete, ask to restart endlessly <body> On a Macbook Air laptop, on 10.10.3, I'm trying to upgrade to 10.10.4. The first time, the system downloaded the file. After the download, I had a message saying (I'm translating form french): "download of some updates did not finish; they can't be installed". Since then, the system update shows with the "update" button, but the system does not redownload the file, I see a notification saying the system will reboot, but actually it will display the above error message.  How can I force the upgrade?  <answer195490> This should be easy to resolve.  ol liPower down and boot into Recovery HD (Command R) or safe boot (shift)/li liOnce you know the OS can boot itself - check for free space.
