Is iPod docking station just a USB with a different connector? <body> Let's say I'm building a device with an iPod docking connector. Can I use standard software for USB on the device side? Are there any special considerations?  The device is supposed to play audio. Charging is good to have but optional.  <answer137227> Engadget has a great tutorial on how to create a custom iPod docking station, along with system configurations, etc.   Hope this helps:   How-To: iPod docking station/configuration  <comment163031> There are many models of iPod and several different dock connectors. What precicely are you attempting to learn / accomplish?
