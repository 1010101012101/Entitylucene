Applescript IF statement with click and keystroke? <body> I would like to make a script that press down the shift button every time i click on something and maintains it pressed until I release click. Something like:  If click then key down shift "when click released" key down shift  Thank you for your help I've been struggling with this one !  <answer98684> I don't know any way to do that with AppleScript, but you could add something like this to KeyRemap4MacBook's private.xml:  precode&lt;autogen&gt;__PointingButtonToKey__ PointingButton::MIDDLE, KeyCode::SHIFT_L&lt;/autogen&gt; /code/pre  See the source for the key code values and predefined settings.  <comment115844> Which real-world problem/usage scenario are you trying to solve with this? There might be easier solutions out their than AppleScript, depending on the actual problem you are trying to solve.
