FaceTime audio on Mac not working (video is fine) <body> Whenever I try to make a FaceTime audio call from my Mac (10.9.3) I just get "Call Failed".   This happens regardless of whether I use the FaceTime Audio button in the FaceTime app or the "phone" icon/button in Messages or Contacts.  FaceTime video works fine, as does FaceTime audio from my iPhone.  <comment157411> does it work in any other VoiP <comment157469> @Buscarì›ƒ such as what? Skype works fine. <comment249884> To what kind of device (Mac, iPhone, iPad) and OS (iOS9,8, OSX 10.10) are you trying to make a FaceTime call? Can you receive a FaceTime call from any device? <comment250321> @dordio from Mac to iPhone iOS8 (haven't tried since iOS9 upgrade)
