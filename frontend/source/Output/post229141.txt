iCloud Photo library broken <body> I have three Apple devices: an iPhone, iPad mini (both running iOS 9.2.1) and MacBook Air running El Capitan 10.11.3.  I have a library of roughly 7000 photos, which has up to now seamlessly synced between all my devices. However, this week Photos on the MacBook has stopped showing the ~7000 photos, and only shows the ~1200 that are currently downloaded (I had codeOptimize Mac Storage/code turned on). It also believes that all of these now need uploading, and says it is uploading these 1200 items.  I have tried disabling iCloud Photo Library in the preferences for Photos, restarting the machine and then re-enabling it, which briefly seems to work (it will say preparing 7000 items), but then ten minutes later Photos has gone back to saying it is uploading the current local items, and the thumbnails for the missing ~5800 images have not appeared.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how to force the MacBook back in sync?
