How can I use tabs in Mac Mail? <body> One of the new featuers in macOS Sierra are tabs in more apps, including Mail.  How do I use tabs in Mac Mail? Clicking "View", "Show tab bar" displays a bar with one tab, but I can't find a way to open a new tab.  <answer254584> For tabs to work in all situations, you need to enable them in System Preferences-Dock (set the appropriate option to "always"). Afterwards, you can (in Mail) select "File -- New window" or press kbdOpt-Cmd-N/kbd to create a new tab.   <comment316945> New Tab is normally Cmd/T [don't have sierra to test] <comment316946> Cmd-T opens the Font Selector in Mail :-) <comment316998> This doesn't work, it opens a new window, and not a new tab. <comment316999> It does work for me. Did you set the tab option to "Always" in System Preferences-Dock? <comment317002> I had it set to "in full-screen only". Thanks. <comment317003> In fact, you don't even have to have the tab bar open, that setting was enough to get it to work.
