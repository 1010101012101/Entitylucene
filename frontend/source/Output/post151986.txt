Change MAC address in OS X Yosemite <body> I usually changed my MAC address with the following commands:  precode# Get a New MAC Address openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//' # Changing the MAC Address sudo ifconfig en0 ether d4:33:a3:ed:f2:12 /code/pre  When I enter:  precodeifconfig en0 |grep ether /code/pre  I still get the old MAC address :( - Who can help? I would love to have a script or system to automatically change it on system boot.  <answer152184> You need to disassociate the device before changing the MAC address. For codeen0/code, it will be:  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z sudo ifconfig en0 ether d4:33:a3:ed:f2:12 networksetup -detectnewhardware /code/pre  <answer183370> One possible problem is that randomly generated MACs will fail half the time. The first byte of a MAC address needs to be even (e.g. end in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, A, C, E).  So, for example, 3b:92:22:cf:55:7e wouldn't work because '3b' is odd. See Wikipedia's MAC address article for the details (even = unicast, odd = multicast).  To avoid this problem, you can slightly edit your random-MAC sed command to force the second nibble to 0.   precodeopenssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//' /code/pre  Combining this with hrbrmstr's answer worked for me:  precodesudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z sudo ifconfig en0 ether $(openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/./0/2; s/.$//') networksetup -detectnewhardware /code/pre  <answer183388> This command works fine for me, the random script have I taken from this answer: https://serverfault.com/a/299564 from MadHatter.  precodesudo ifconfig en0 ether $(perl -e 'for ($i=0;$i&lt;5;$i++){@m[$i]=int(rand(256));} printf "02:%X:%X:%X:%X:%X\n",@m;') &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en0 down &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en0 up /code/pre  <answer201443> Use this     sudo ifconfig en0 lladdr d4:33:a3:ed:f2:12   See the manual page of ifconfig     man ifconfig   <answer204518> Ferros made a sweet node tool to do just this https://github.com/feross/spoof  He has a Python version as well https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC  <answer206519> This works!  Steps:  ol liGet the MAC address of your Apple TV and write it down.  It's found in the Network Settings./li liGet the MAC address of your MacBook (Yosemite OS version).

It will be in the "En0" section./li liCut/Paste the following (replacing the X's with your Apple TV MAC address) into a teminal window:/li /ol  h1change MAC OSX to the Apple TV MAC/h1  sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z  sudo ifconfig en0 ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX   networksetup -detectnewhardware  ol start="4" liEnter your password if prompted and repeat step 3, if necessary**/li liReconnect to the hotel wireless with your MAC (not Apple TV) and accept the conditions of service./li liCut/paste the following into the terminal window (replace the Y's with your MAC OSX MAC address)/li /ol  h1change MAC address back to original/h1  sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Resources/airport -z  sudo ifconfig en0 ether YY:YY:YY:YY:YY:YY  networksetup -detectnewhardware  ol start="7" liConnect to the hotel wireless with your Apple TV.  /li /ol  <answer244386> precodesudo ifconfig en0 ether `openssl rand -hex 5|perl -nE '$s.=join":",/../g}{say"02:$s"'`&amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en0 down &amp;&amp; sudo ifconfig en0 up /code/pre  My is much smarter :)  <answer275038> Here's my contribution to change your MAC address: https://gist.github.com/vinyll/b511159cce2d25edafe78403749088ca  precode#/bin/sh  # Instructions: # 1. Copy this script locally and run the following `chmod +x mac-address-spoofer.sh` # 2. Later, run the following: `./mac-address.spoofer.sh` and see your MAC address changing.  echo "origin MAC address: " `sudo ifconfig en0 ether | grep ether` sudo ifconfig en0 ether `openssl rand -hex 6 | sed 's/\(..\)/\1:/g; s/.$//'` echo "new MAC address: " `sudo ifconfig en0 ether | grep ether` /code/pre  <comment178845> Have you tried SpoofMAC (`pip install SpoofMAC`)? This still works on Yosemite for me. <comment246522> Installing node.js to do something which can be done by simply running `ifconfig` seems kind of overkill... <comment246526> Kind of goes without saying that it's a solution for node users. He also has a Python (which comes pre-installed on Macs) version https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC <comment248947> How does this relate to the problem described in the question? <comment267337> I tried this, and it still didn't work for me. <comment267339> This method worked for me. This needs to go higher on the answer list. <comment271355> @FengHuo it worked for me, on 10.11.2 (though I used a different MAC address) <comment321914> Works on 10.11.6 <comment324344> You just made our family vacation much more enjoyable for the parents. Had to get the Apple TV onto the hotel's network behind a login screen and spoofing the MAC address worked a charm :) <comment326019> When you answer smart questions, dumb people like you do that.
