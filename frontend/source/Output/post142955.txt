Can't stream Airplay after upgrading to iOS 7 <body> I have an Iphone 4 and a Mac Mini running 10.6.8 and Airserver. With iOS 6, I used to be able to stream video from my Iphone to the Mac using Airplay; however, after upgrading to iOS 7, I can't do that anymore:  ul liIf I start a video, hit the Airplay button in the video player and choose the Mac, it will tell me "The operation could not be completed"./li liIf I choose the Airplay button in the Control Center and then hit Play, it will ignore me and reset the choice in the Airplay menu to my iPhone./li liThe only thing I can "stream" are photos: if I activate Airplay in the Control Center and then access my Photos app, the pictures will appear in the Mac./li /ul  This happens both with my Mac Mini and with a Macbook running 10.8.5.  Can anyone confirm whether this is a bug, or they dropped support for Airplay with my Iphone in iOS 7?  <comment168400> Well, they didn't drop supportâ€¦ <comment169241> The way I see it, if I used to be able to do something with a piece of hardware and I can't anymore, then it's the manufacturer who has "dropped support". Or remove a feature that used to work. Anyway, I just wanted to confirm that it isn't a bug on my part, but an intentional behaviour by Apple.
