How to access the Wi-Fi password through Terminal? <body> I am at my school and the computer I am currently using is connected to a Wi-Fi network. I want to know the Wi-Fi password and I am on a Mac. I know there is a way to do it through Terminal.  What I am using is:  precodesecurity find-generic-password -ga  AirPort /code/pre  I use that to find the password if it is in a keychain, but I know there is another way to do it. My friend who is a coder told me their is but they said they wont help me. All they told me was "generic" was a hint. I used "generic" in my command but I don't get it.  I tried your answer but it keeps asking my for the admin password. I am connected to the wifi but it still wont work. My coding friend looked at this and said I'm not looking for a AirPort password I'm looking for a regular password.  <answer176121> precodesecurity find-generic-password -D "AirPort network password" -a SSID -g /code/pre  Replace codeSSID/code with the SSID of the network that you wish to obtain the key of.br This command looks for all keys with a type of "AirPort network password" and searches for the key with the name of the SSID that you provide.  <answer196387> I'm not sure what version of OS X the other answer or original question is for but it's not accurate on 10.10 Mavericks. You need this:  precodesecurity find-generic-password -D "802.1X Password" /code/pre  Maybe networks using actual Apple AirPort hardware are saved in the keychain Differently?  <answer212865> I think what you're actually looking for is this:   presecurity find-generic-password -ga "ROUTERNAME" | grep "password:"/pre  You'll get in response something like:  prepassword: "ThePassword"/pre  Hope this helps!  <answer230793> Simple,   precode$ sudo security find-generic-password -D "AirPort network password" -a YOUR_SSID_NAME -g Password: keychain: "/Library/Keychains/System.keychain" class: "genp" attributes:     0x00000007 &lt;blob&gt;="YOUR_SSID_NAME"     0x00000008 &lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "acct"&lt;blob&gt;="DansLeVille"     "cdat"&lt;timedate&gt;=0x32303135313131363031313933305A00  "20151116011930Z\000"     "crtr"&lt;uint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "cusi"&lt;sint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "desc"&lt;blob&gt;="AirPort network password"     "gena"&lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "icmt"&lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "invi"&lt;sint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "mdat"&lt;timedate&gt;=0x32303135313131363031313933305A00  "20151116011930Z\000"     "nega"&lt;sint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "prot"&lt;blob&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "scrp"&lt;sint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt;     "svce"&lt;blob&gt;="AirPort"     "type"&lt;uint32&gt;=&lt;NULL&gt; password: "pseudononymous1234!!!" /code/pre  <comment207844> Prerequisite, you are the owner, with Admin password, you are or have been connected to the specific WiFi and the password is saved in keychain. <comment289517> This is the same command I answered with over a year priorâ€¦?
