How to forcefully remove status bar icon? <body> I had this app called Spark for working environment communication.  However, the status bar icon of this app is so ugly that I avoid look at it every time when I glimpsing over status bar.  The worst thing is there is no option for hide it in the settings. Is there anyway that I can forcefully remove it?   <answer126502> There is an app called Broomstick. It's free and can hide any app icon in the menubar.  <answer126522> Try strongBartender/strong. This lets you hide (as well as re-arrange) menu bar items, as well as providing a secondary menu bar so that you can hide icons from the main bar but still have access to them on a keyboard shortcut or menu bar item.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Zusk.png" width="555"  <comment148195> Have you tried pressing cmd + dragging the icon out of the bar? <comment148200> @2DD8847 Yes, I have, it doesn't work. <comment148201> Please check the options within Spark. Apps often have an checkbox to hide icon from status bar. <comment148202> Please note it's not officially compatible with Mavericks. <comment148206> As Spark is an open source project, consider logging a bug or requesting the ability to turn off the status bar icon. It may already be possible but poorly documented. <comment148240> Looks good, however, it costs $15. Do you have any cheaper or free alternatives? <comment148469> Broomstick also doesn't support the app that I want to hide, and I need to submit a request for hide that app. <comment148470> @Rob It doesn't have this option <comment148471> @GrahamMiln This app is really a mess, I only open it because I need it during work. Bartender is the best option, despite it costs $15.
