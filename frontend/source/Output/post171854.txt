CUPS and Department IDs <body> The printer I'm trying to use requires a department ID and code for authentication and volume tracking. I'm using RAW protocol on port 9100 but could change this if necessary.  It is possible to enable department IDs ("E.K.C." - I don't know what this abbreviation means) in OS X 10.8 CUPS, but I've found no way to actually set the department name and code in CUPS configuration. Are they hidden in a configuration file and not accessible by CUPS webinterface or where are they?  Thank you in advance!
