Does OSX 10.9.1 have fontconfig installed by default? <body> I found at least the manual from my Macbook air. I have installed XCode full package.  strongHow can you see if you have fontconfig?/strong I cannot find any such command in terminal nor in Fontbook.  <answer118739> It's not provided by the system (nor the XCode installation). But you can get it with   ul liMacPort (codesudo port install fontconfig/code)/li liHomebrew (codebrew install fontconfig/code) /li /ul
