Put entire OS X home folder into Google Drive <body> I know it's possible to relocate the home folder on the mac to somewhere other than code/Users/[username]/code. But would it be possible to move it to, say, code/Users/[username]/Google Drive/code without messing up the Google Drive app which syncs files between the computer and the cloud?  <answer143014> strongYes./strong OS X sees the Google Drive folder as any other folder, so there is no problem putting your home folder there, providing you don't asynchronously write to core Library files, using Drive is fine.  <comment168455> Some directories would probably not be synced e.g. ~/Libray/Caches, ~/Downloads as they contain data which changes often and does not need yo be kept <comment168514> I really really DO NOT recommend this. But yes, it works.
