Automatically Inserting Text Globally <body> Let's say I want this action to happen on any program whenever I press F10 (or some other custom key combination):  precodePaste the text: "Hello World!" /code/pre  There's a similar tool in Windows called emAutoHotKey/em but apparently it doesn't have a Mac equivalent.  Any idea how to achieve this on Mac?  <answer87971> There is no option integrated into MacOS, but I think the software TextExpander is doing what you are asking for. You can specify shortcuts like "adr" to paste your whole address for example.  <answer87989> Using Automator :   ul liCreate a new Service with automator /li liSelect emService receives selected strongno input/strong in strongany application/em/strong/li liAdd a strongRun AppleScript/strong action /li /ul  Copy this script :   precodeon run {input, parameters}   tell application "System Events"     keystroke "Text to type"   end tell end run /code/pre  ul liSave your new service/li liIn System Preferences  Keyboard  Keyboard Shortcuts  Services add a keyboard shortcut to your news ervice/li /ul  NB: Replace "Text to type" by the text you want to add. Typing it will for example use directly the current style in apps like Word etc.   <comment102934> Creating a service with Automator then bind it to a keyboard short cut could be an a solution <comment102939> Matt, actually I've been considering Automator but I've never really understood how it works. Any idea how I can achieve this there? <comment102964> See my answer below. I gave the full procedure to create such services and you them with the keyboard.
