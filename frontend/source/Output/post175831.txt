BBoD even after fresh install to new HDD <body> Got a bit of a weird issue which is driving me nuts, i have a Mac Pro tower which was purchased around 2010, it has been in storage for the past 2 years. Anyway I recently hooked it all up and found that i once i logged in i would hang when attempting to do anything really.  After some investigation i figured it was probably the HDD, it is about 5 years old at this point.  So I replaced the HDD and done a fresh install of Snow Leopard 10.6.3 but it doesn't seem to have made any difference. At this point i have ran out of ideas, any help would be greatly appreciated.  <comment207495> All those TLA! so what is BBoD ? Did you try booting in Safe mode ? <comment207498> BBoD = Beach Ball of Death. @cosmicsafari - have you replaced the RAM battery?
