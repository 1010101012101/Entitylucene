Why don't my icloud.com contacts download to my iPhone? <body> I've manually imported my Google Contacts into icloud.com (via a vCard file). Now I'd like to have these contacts available on my iPhone. My iCloud is property set up (Settings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars  iCloud). "Fetch New Data" is set to Push, "Contacts" switch is turned on.  Nevertheless the contacts don't sync. How can I analyze and fix this?  <answer158384> Phone restart fixed the issue.  <answer158393> Did you try a restart of the phone?  Also go to Contacts and click the "group" button in the top left and make certain that "All iCloud" is checked.  <comment186204> Did you try a restart of the phone?

Still, there should be a "Sync manually now" button. <comment186211> Cool, I'll make it an answer then.  And I guess Apples theory is they don't need a manual sync button because it's not suppose to break, it's just supposed to work, but yea at least some indication that sync wasn't running.
