Scrolling or resizing windows are no longer smooth on my iMac <body> Scrolling is no longer smooth on my iMac, neither is resizing windows by clicking the (+) button. This is happening just to my user, I created another user for testing, and everything was smooth with the new account.  I already restarted the computer, and already finished all running programs. Nothing works.  My iMac is mid 2011 i5 2.5 Ghz and 16GB RAM, running OS X Lion 10.7.4  Thanks for any help.  <answer55556> Sounds like something might be stealing all your processor cycles - run Activity Monitor (in the Utilities folder) and see if anything stands out as the culprit.  <comment63746> Exactly what do you mean by "not smooth"?
