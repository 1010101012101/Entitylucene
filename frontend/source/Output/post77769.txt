Will it Work?.. Download querry for ipod <body> I have an ipod and have two accounts with Apple. I was wondering if I started to download an app with one of my accounts and then  logged out of that account and used the other one, would the download still continue?   <answer77775> Yes, once you have authenticated with Apple the download will continue just fine even if you log out while it is running.  <comment90073> Sounds like something you could try. Please report back the results.
