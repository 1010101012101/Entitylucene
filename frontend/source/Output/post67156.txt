How can I enter a shortcode on a 4G iPad? <body> I'm using a prepaid wireless carrier with my iPad.  I can buy codes for the carrier that add credit to my account.  On a cell phone, I'd dial these codes using something like code*101*(digits)#/code.  The iPad doesn't appear to have a "dialer" -- is it possible to enter this sort of code emsomewhere/em?  <answer70991> Everything I've seen seems to indicate that no, there's no way to send a shortcode to your network provider on any iPad.  This is dumb, but apparently par for the course :(
