How do I save the Numbers document I'm working on? <body> Using Numbers 3.6.2, and would like to save document to finish later. Where do I save it? (Saving to PDF is permanent)  <answer239041> You can save it anywhere you want.  Just do codeCommand-S/code or go to codeFile --&gt; Save/code and it will bring up a dialog box.  You can use the default location or any other folder/location you want.  You can even save it to your iCloud account from the same dialog.
