Export iTunes music library information (album, artist, track names) to CSV or spreadsheet format? <body> Is there a way to strongexport/strong album/track information from an iTunes music library into, say, a strongcomma-separated values (CSV) file/strong, or another spreadsheet-friendly format?  I'd like to be able to grab a snapshot of at least basic metadata &ndash; being strongartist name, album name, and track name/strong &ndash; and copy into a spreadsheet or database software for reference, cleansing, &amp; analysis.  (If you want to call me a music nerd for wanting to data-mine information about my CD collection, go right ahead! :-)  Is there a way to do such a metadata export within iTunes itself, or else might there be a third-party tool that can extract such information from iTunes library storage?  Or perhaps you have a quick &amp; dirty homebrew script of your own you could share here?  I'm aware there is XML somewhere in the bowels of my iTunes library, and I'm a programming nerd too, but I'm hoping somebody has already invented this particular wheel.  Thanks!  <answer46313> You can do File - Library - Export Library and get an XML file of your library metadata. From there it would be a relatively straightforward matter for a programmer to convert the XML data into a CSV, spreadsheet, or database.  For example, I made this quick Ruby script in about 10 minutes to get the artist, album, and track names from the XML and output a CSV. Note that it will only match tracks that have all 3 pieces of info provided, and that it requires the library file to be called "Library.xml" in the current directory:  precoderequire 'csv'  track = /&lt;key&gt;Name&lt;\/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;(.*)&lt;\/string&gt;[.\s]*&lt;key&gt;Artist&lt;\/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;(.*)&lt;\/string&gt;[.\s]*&lt;key&gt;Album&lt;\/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;(.*)&lt;\/string&gt;/  file = File.open("Library.xml", "r") contents = file.read  out = CSV.open("Library.csv", "w")  contents.scan(track) do |match|   out &lt;&lt; match end /code/pre  <answer46317> Make sure all the columns you want metadata for are visible in the playlist or library you're looking at. Then, select the tunes you want with kbdshift/kbd-click or kbd⌘/kbd-click or whatever:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UjbYg.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then, hit kbd⌘/kbd+kbdC/kbd to copy. This will allow you to paste what's visible in the iTunes playlist into any sort of spreadsheet you like:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6YKyS.png" alt="enter image description here"  It won't label the columns for you, but it'll do the trick quickly.  <answer86472> For enhancements/tools to work with ITunes probably the first place to go is  Doug's Applescripts for iTunes. There are many useful scripts here.  On the page for Exporting Info there is this script that exports track information as a text file.     This script will write a discrete alphabetical list of your choice of the Albums, Artists, Album Artists, Composers, Genres, Shows, or Track Names in iTunes to a text file.   <answer178814> Please consider giving www.iTunesStats.com a try. It is a Visual Basic script I wrote that loops through your iTunes library and provides a text file of all kinds of statistics. It then puts those stats into a .csv file for you to keep long-term.  <comment52918> Huh, didn't even consider that. Nice answer! <comment52919> @Kyle I saw the question and actually said, out loud, in my apartment, to nobody, "OH, I ACTUALLY KNOW THIS ONE!" <comment52921> I've been testing this out, and it works great for up to a few hundred rows, but I can't get it to work much beyond that. If the OP wants to do analytics on his entire library, he may want to use my method. <comment52922> @KyleCronin I'm not surprised. I imagine this functionality is mainly used to do stuff like make liner notes for burned CDs and such. <comment52925> Thanks!  I like the simplicity.  If only this feature were more discoverable. <comment52927> FWIW, I was able to export all ~1500 rows on my Mac's iTunes library, and all ~16000 rows on my Windows iTunes library.  Also, I used **Cmd-A** (Windows: **Ctrl-A**) to select all rows, instead of the mouse.  I may still resort to Kyle's method to automate this and get at raw bits instead.  Both answers are excellent. <comment52932> @Chris Glad it worked out for you. I tried to copy my whole library and ran into trouble - but with Google Docs having a character limit, not with something iTunes related. <comment189473> This doesn't seem to work for me on the latest iTunes! <comment189926> @Jash Which iTunes? I just tested it out with iTunes 12 and it still worked. <comment190807> Was searching for something else, found this. Perfect; always wondered how to do it. <comment211877> This could be a really interesting answer to the problem but it suffers from: 1) a lack of example output that shows *specificallly* how it answer the question being asked; and 2) instructions for how you would use it on a Mac (remember, this is an *Apple* site and iTunes runs on both Windows and Apple machines). If you added some more detail you might find you're not attracting down votes. <comment259770> Still works in 2015 with iTunes 12.3.1.23 64-bit.
