Is it safe to delete system logs? <body> I'm using DaisyDisk to clean my hard drive and it is showing nearly 8GB of files in code/private/var/log/asl/code. Are those files safe to delete?  <answer98199> strongYes/strong, you can safely delete log files. In the case of an application needing to write a new entry and the file not being found, it will be re-created automatically.  Just bear in mind that these ASL (emApple System Log/em) files may contain some emuseful/em information to trace or debug any issues you could be experimenting with your computer, which, of course, will be lost with the deletion of the files.   So, in case you might want to take a look at these files before deleting them, you could use the codesyslog/code command as follows: codesyslog -f /private/var/log/asl/nameOfTheFile.asl/code  <comment115296> Logs do get cleaned automatically usually, so it might be worthwhile to have a look at the timestamps of the logs. If they are more than 2-3 weeks old, the cleanup doesn't seem to be working (which would probably lead to a new question...). <comment115302> Wow, 8GB of logs!?
