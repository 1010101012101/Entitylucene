Sound notifications from Messages, but not Thunderbird are muted when in full screen Citrix, but not full screen anything else <body> Because Thunderbird works fine, we know that Citrix doesn't cause everything else besides itself to be muted. There's something about Messages that it doesn't like. If the Citrix desktop is not in full screen mode, everything is fine too.  Any ideas on this?  <comment161391> If you wish to delete your question, use the delete button under the post. Remember that all contributions are CC-Wiki
