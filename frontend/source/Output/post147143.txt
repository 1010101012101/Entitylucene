"Unable to download the software from the server at this time error" when installing printer <body> I keep getting the following message (see image below) when trying to install a shared printer, I first got this error a month ago and have been trying every couple of days since, but i guess the error is permanent rather than a glitch.   Any ideas how i could resolve this ?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DUrLX.png" alt="error message"  <answer147157> Normally your Apple would automatically download the supported printer drivers with system software.  Run a Software update (Click on Apple icon top left) on you computer to get a update.  OR--  Download the driver from here:  http://www.techspot.com/drivers/driver/file/information/16150/     Apple delivers third-pary software for scanners and printers via   Software Update. Simply connect the printer or scanner to the Mac. If   software is needed and available, OS X will automatically download and   install it.      This article is a comprehensive list of currently supported printer   and scanner models and associated software provided by third-party   vendors as of 28 June 2012.      Important: Run Software Update before connecting to a printer or   scanner. This will update the Mac's database on the latest supported   printer and scanner models.   <comment246825> Does the error persist past a day or a week?
