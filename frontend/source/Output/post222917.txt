How do I use ffmpeg to convert audible files <body> I'm running ffmpeg v2.8.1 from Homebrew, and trying to convert Audible files but there's some trick I"m missing.  This command produces this error output.  precodeffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i Volume1.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp4  [mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x7fc9a4010600] [aax] file checksum == d72f1f04e3c73d0bc68e742db1bc69b58dc3a500 [mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x7fc9a4010600] [aax] mismatch in checksums! [mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 @ 0x7fc9a4010600] error reading header Volume1.aax: Invalid data found when processing input /code/pre  I know the file is ok, because it plays in iTunes. I does have the file image/cover art embedded in it as well,  From the ffmpeg docs, I read Audible AAX files are encrypted M4B files, and they can be decrypted by specifying a 4 byte activation secret.  I'm presuming - probably incorrectly - that the one given is ok. If not, how does one find that secret.  <answer223309> This will get you your activation secret:  https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator  <answer243670>  First run these commands:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codebrew install chromedriver ffmpeg sudo easy_install pip pip install selenium requests git clone https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator cd audible-activator sed -i '' 's,chromedriver_path = "./chromedriver",chromedriver_path = "/usr/local/bin/chromedriver",' audible-activator.py ./audible-activator.py /code/pre  Then enter your Audible username and password and wait for a while for the eight character activation key to be printed.  If you do not run the codesed/code command that changes the value of the codechromedriver_path/code variable, code./audible-activator.py/code results in an error like code'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH/code even if codechromedriver/code is on the path or in the codeaudible-activator/code directory.  After that run a command like this:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeffmpeg -activation_bytes youractivationkey -i input.aax -vn -c:a copy output.m4a;mv output.m4{a,b} /code/pre  If you try to use the codeffmpeg/code command with an codeaa/code file instead of an codeaax/code file, it results in an error like codeOption activation_bytes not found/code. To download a book from Audible as codeaax/code instead of codeaa/code, choose "Enhanced" from the "Audio Quality" dropdown in the view for downloading a book.  codeaax/code files are encrypted codemp4/code / codem4a/code / codem4b/code files so the codeffmpeg/code command does not re-encode audio and it preserves metadata such as chapters. codemp4/code, codem4a/code, and codem4b/code are alternative filename extensions for the MPEG-4 Part 14 container format. One difference between the codem4a/code and codem4b/code extensions is that the option to remember the previous playback position in iTunes is enabled by default for files with an codem4b/code extension but not for files with an codem4a/code extension. iTunes also displays files with an codem4b/code extension under audiobooks by default.  <answer263459> I tried user4669748's answer, and ran into a few things worth noting, and discovered a fix that got things to work for me:  ol liaudible-activator.py requires Python 2.7; it fails with Python 3./li liAfter starting it, the Chrome window pops-up on the screen and you start to see GUI activity, and a successful login to Audible./li liSoon after login, browser activity seems to hang, with codeWaiting for px.owneriq.net/code constantly displayed in the bottom status bar./li liAfter 5 minutes, I had a TimeoutException:  precode[*] Player ID is 2jmj7l5rSw0yVb/vlWAYkK/YBwk= Traceback (most recent call last):   File "./audible-activator.py", line 151, in &lt;module&gt;     fetch_activation_bytes(username, password, options)   File "./audible-activator.py", line 74, in fetch_activation_bytes     search_box.submit()   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py", line 88, in submit     self._execute(Command.SUBMIT_ELEMENT)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webelement.py", line 494, in _execute     return self._parent.execute(command, params)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/webdriver.py", line 236, in execute     self.error_handler.check_response(response)   File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/errorhandler.py", line 192, in check_response     raise exception_class(message, screen, stacktrace) selenium.common.exceptions.TimeoutException: Message: timeout: cannot determine loading status from timeout: Timed out receiving message from renderer: -0.222   (Session info: chrome=54.0.2840.98)   (Driver info: chromedriver=2.25.426935 (820a95b0b81d33e42712f9198c215f703412e1a1),platform=Mac OS X 10.12.0 x86_64) /code/pre/li /ol  At this, I was stuck.  However, thinking that codepx.owneriq.net/code is some kind of ad or tracking site, I tried to "temporarily disable" it by adding to code/etc/hosts/code with an invalid IP address, e.g.  precode0.0.0.0 px.owneriq.net /code/pre  (This was a tactic suggested by a friend to stop ads in browser.)  After this addition to code/etc/hosts/code, re-run the program.  It ran to completion in 30 seconds.  A 4-byte activation key was printed to the screen, and worked perfectly with ffmpeg as described in user4669748's answer.  I then restored code/etc/hosts/code to its original content.  <comment330963> I used [this script](https://github.com/KrumpetPirate/AAXtoMP3) to do the actual conversion.  It's also worth noting that you have to install `selenium` and `requests` via `pip` or `easy_install` and also download and extract chromedriver into the `audible-activator` directory for it to work.  This info is provided in `audible-activator`'s README but it is useful to know up front :) <comment363500> I'm using `.aax` files and getting the error: `Unrecognized option 'activation_bytes'.`. Any ideas? Has Audible changed their format in the last year?
