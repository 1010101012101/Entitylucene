Is there a way to force specific apps to run and remain in a specific order? <body> I've been trying for days to figure out the correct way to phrase this question, so please do not hesitate to correct me.  I have four apps that I always run in full screen mode and I always have them in a specific order. It looks like this:  ul liDashboard/li liSpotify/li liIRC App/li liDesktop/li liBrowser/li liSublime Text/li /ul  The problem I would like to solve is, even though I set them in this order, they don't always stay in that order. I can't figure out why. The browser, for example, will sometimes slide over to the left side of the desktop.  So two questions:  ul liIs there a way to have these specific apps open on start up?/li liIs there a way to lock them into these positions, both on start up and during normal use?/li /ul  I'm running a MacBook on OS X El Capitan v10.11.6  <answer261735> In OS X 10.11 the default under strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongMission Control/strong for the strongAutomatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use/strong is checked. So to not have your emSpaces/em rearranged on you, uncheck the checkbox for that setting.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1MqEa.png" alt="Mission Control Preferences"  To have an App tied to a particular strongDesktop/strong, open the target App on that strongDesktop/strong, then control-click (right-click) the target App's strongDock Tile/strong and select: strongOptions/strong  Assign To  strongThis Desktop/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/df1uZ.png" alt="Dock Tile &gt; Options &gt; This Desktop"  To have an App launch automatically upon Login, go to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong  emselect the/em strongUser/strong  emclick/em strongLogin Items/strong and add the App.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSq7X.png" alt="Login Items"  <answer261736> I believe you will need a third-party tool to manage this, such as Lingon ($10), Startupizer ($10), or Keyboard Maestro ($36). With any of these applications (and probably others), you can set the order to launch applications in and optionally set delays in between them.  <comment327742> I didn't see an option for "this desktop", only "keep in dock", "open at login" and "show in finder" <comment327745> @Andrew Fox, I've updated my answer with some screenshots for each point. These are from an OS X 10.11.6 build.  If you do not see  **This Desktop** as shown in the second image then you'll need to provide more information then "_I didn't see an option for ..._" <comment327780> I don't think that will work for full-screen applications, though. <comment327799> http://prntscr.com/d9s6k4 Here is my screen shot <comment327804> @Andrew Fox, The only time I've seen the Options context menu look like that is when the system defaults are in play. In other words when there is only one Desktop (Space) defined. I assumed from your question you already have multiple Desktops set up in Mission Control (the app not the preferences pane). If you do have multiple Desktops then this may be a case where you need to toggle the bit, so to speak, to fix it. Temporarily delete all but the first Desktop in Mission Control then logout/login and add back the Desktops. Does the context menu show correctly now? <comment327806> I think I understand now. I have my apps in fullscreen mode, which I prefer, but what you're saying is to add a desktop and then assign it. I added a new desktop and then I do have the option to assign it to that desktop. I'll muck around with this for a bit and see how it works <comment328355> works perfectly, thank you!
