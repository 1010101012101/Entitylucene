Xcode 6 and MacBookPro 2014 128 Gig with Yosemite - OVERHEATING and Long Load Time <body> I have a BRAND new Macbook Pro running Yosemite and xCode 6.1. EVERY TIME I try to open xCode it completely overheats my computer and takes 15 minutes to open xCode. I have no idea what is happening. I was going to remove and reinstall xCode but it is now done through the Mac App Store. Any help or advice would be much appreciated!  <answer156587> If you have a Developer account you can download the DMG directly form here  <comment184109> What does activity monitor show - as for delete Xcode why not just delete it? <comment204079> I am having the same issue. how did you resolve?
