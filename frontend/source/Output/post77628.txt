How can I browse photos on iPhone in Mac OSX? <body> Previously, on Windows, iPhone was recognized as a camera and I could browse image folder with Explorer without a need to import/download/tranfer photo files to the computer.  Is there a way to do the same on Mac OSX? I mean, all approaches I have ever read are somehow connected to import procedure (iPhoto, Preview, iTunes, etc.) or to hacking the iPhone and installing some apps that will allow to mount the phone as storage drive work.   What is the easiest and most straightforward way to view that files without transferring them to a computer?  <answer77635> The Image Capture app allows you to browse the iPhone's photos, albeit not at full size or resolution, without first downloading the image files to your computer. Image Capture also gives you the tools to download all or selected subranges of the photos on your iPhone, as well as deletion.  <answer77763> iPhoto will show you a preview of the photos on your phone, and you can view the photos without importing/downloading/transferring/etc.  <answer78993> This isn't as direct as just plugging your iPhone into a computer, but it's possible to browse your iPhone photos via dropbox instead.  Just install Dropbox (via ** www.dropbox.com/) , and use the "Enable Dropbox Camera Import" preference setting.  ** Updated : just search for "dropbox" on the app store, it's free. **  Now, every time that your iPhone (or any iDevice setup this way) is connected to the USB charging cable that is connected to your computer, all of your new photos and videos are automatically imported into your Dropbox folder.  ALSO worth noting : Just by using this feature, you can earn more FREE Dropbox space.  <answer79114> I found a solution here: Basically, with Photostream activated, you can set up a search criteria in Finder to quickly access photos you've take on your iPhone without having to do much work (ie, importing with a separate app, hooking up your device to your computer via usb, etc.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D8iKk.png" alt="enter image description here"     h2Locate the Photo Stream in the Finder/h2      Since the user’s Library folder is now hidden by default, I can’t just give you the file path. In the Finder, option-click on the Go menu and hit “Library.” Then navigate to Application Support  iLifeAssetManagement  assets  sub. In the search filed, type “png”; then select “Portable Network Graphics image” from the popup.      h2Save the Search/h2      Click the Save button under the search field. Give the saved search a name like “Screenshots.” Leave “Add to Sidebar” checked.      This ought to be the end, but it’s not. For some reason, this particular saved search acts up when accessed from the Finder sidebar (at least on my version of OS X). Sometimes it works, sometimes it returns zero results. The fix for this is to add it to the Dock instead. Hit up the contextual menu and do that.   <answer80376> The only way that I know of to view full-size content on an iPhone…  ul liOn a device other than said iPhone, and/li liWithout transferring the content onto said other device/li /ul  …is to use AirPlay. You can use an Apple TV to view your photos on your television, or use a third-party app such as Reflector App (no affiliation) to turn your Mac into an AirPlay receiver.  While I can't test this method myself, it should allow you to wirelessly view (but not edit or transfer) photos on your iPhone using your Mac. I would imagine that you could preview photos with AirPlay while simultaneously using Image Capture to select photos for transferring.  <answer112465> use ibrowse its free and quite straight forward  http://www.ibrowseapp.com/  navigate to the codeMedia\DCIM\10*APPLE/code folders to find the camera roll photos   <answer253167> Open the "Preview"-App, select "File-Import from (your iphone)"  and you can manage your photos as you want. To me the most straightforward way.  <answer254130> You can open the Photos app on your Mac, then on the left side bar you'll see your iPhone icon. If you click on it you can see all your pictures, just like when you open it on Windows Explorer!  <comment90031> Preview of the photos I can see also in Preview, iPhoto and etc. If Image Capture do the same, then it is not the option I am looking for. <comment91096> But they are too small, just a little bit bigger then tiles or thumbnails. I want to browse fullsized pictures as I can do it on Windows. <comment91305> Look to the lower-left corner of iPhoto. There's a zoom control which you can use to increase the size of the thumbnails. Alternatively, you could double-click on the photo itself to have it expand and fill up iPhoto's window. Last but not least, you could also enable full-screen mode using this shortcut: `Ctrl+Cmd+F`. Enjoy! <comment91349> Dropbox's [Camera Upload feature](https://blog.dropbox.com/2012/02/your-photos-simplified-part-1/) works without a cable. More importantly, glaz666 is looking for a solution that won't transfer the photos to his computer, which this would (unless he looked at the photos online). <comment91350> @XCool, double-clicking does nothing when I browse photos on my iPhone in iPhoto. Three-finger tap, Cmd-O, and the spacebar also do nothing. <comment91352> Hmm, sorry, just tested it again and the one that really works is the zoom slider. The rest doesn't work. <comment92756> It should be noted that this still transfers the files to the user's Mac; they just don't need to be *manually* transferred. <comment132052> Welcome to Ask Different! Could you add some detail on how exactly this will solve the problem? <comment143291> Indeed, this is not looking at photos on the iPhone, this is looking at photos *from* the iPhone, transferred automatically. As Photo Stream only contains the last 1,000 images, whereas an iPhone may contain many more photos than that (including more recent images not yet magically synced), this is therefore substantially different to browsing the DCIM folder of an attached iPhone like it's a drive. <comment164449> That is a really nice free iPhone browser! Just go into the DCIM folder (not the Photos one ;) ) and you can go through all your photos. REALLY fast too. <comment186791> Image Capture allows me to delete straight off the device. Love it. Thanks <comment311352> It's ridiculously convoluted. If Apple cared about actual UX and not just Johnny Ive's moods it should come up with a simple solution, provide an answer here and apologise for all the inconvenience. Same goes for M$ and copying files from Mac to Windows Phone BTW - another use case so esoteric there's was no reason to care about it. <comment315071> The OP wants to browse the photos _without_ importing them to the computer.
