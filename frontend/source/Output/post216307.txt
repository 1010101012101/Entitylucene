How can I reset the 'get info' preview image of archive utility? <body> When I zip or download a zipped file, Archive Utility doesn't display it's default zip icon anymore. Also when viewing Info and the large Previewer icon.br It now displays this version of a program I seem to have installed (don't know which).   How can I turn it back to Archive Utility's default blue zip icon when I compress or download a zipped file?br I've tried everything from changing the Get Info icon to going to Core Services (where nothing has changed in the icns files or Archive Utility)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjblo.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer216361> Try changing the default app to something else from the list of potential apps  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LF1m4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then click Change All..  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9Y0q.png" alt="enter image description here"  Reboot.br Ensure the icon is now the correct one for your new choice, then repeat the process to revert to Archive Utility.  <comment261639> Didn't help. No matter what app I set it to and after restoring it to Archive Utility, that large zip image in the preview section stays the same.
