iPad mail shows a copy of sent mail in inbox <body> My sent emails show in my inbox on my iPad. I have looked but "always bcc myself" is not checked. This problem has started only recently, but I am not aware of anything I may have done to start it.  It doesn't happen when I send emails from my Mac computer using the same account.  <answer77344> If you're using imap, you might be storing sent mail on the server. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lxf0.png" alt="Apple Mail Account Settings -&gt; Mailbox Behavior Tab"  If you uncheck that, you won't see the emails on your other devices, because you won't be keeping a copy on the server. (You will have the copy on your local machine)  <answer113769> Are you sending yourelf a bcc: of all mail?  Check your: settings  mail, contacts, calendar  always bcc myself   See if that slider is turned on.   <comment89621> Are you hitting reply-all and thus CCing yourself? I used to do that all the time accidentally on my iPad, and would constantly get my replies in my inbox. <comment89778> Thank you, but that isn't exactly the problem. I am only using an iPad at the moment, no other computer. When i send emails from my iPad to another person, It immediately goes into my inbox as well as my sent folder.  I did check my settings on my google mail account and I couldn't find the exact link you showed me. But from what I can see, the imap settings are correct. <comment89780> Thanks for the suggestion, but no I am not doing that.  It also happens when I compose the email, ie not a reply. <comment133631> No it's not that. I did that first. It was a bigpond account and I've given up using it. <comment151100> Can you test with any other email providers? Does it happen with those, too?
