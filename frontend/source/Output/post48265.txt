How do I make iTunes play slower or faster? I want to play CDs slower for a course I am on. <body> I want to play videos in iTunes faster (1x, 2x, double speed, etc.) or maybe slower. How do I do that?  <answer48266> Right click on the file in iTunes and choose "Show in Finder." Then right click the file and open in Quicktime Player. In Quicktime Player you can choose the playback speed by using the A/V Controls (kbdCommand/kbd + kbdK/kbd or WindowA/V Controls). From there, you can select the playback speed:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WgVgp.png" alt="A/V Controls - QT Player"  Alternatively, you could use VLC or another music player.  <answer104685> The kbdCmd/kbd+kbdK/kbd shortcut no longer works in Lion or Mavericks.   Please see a post about increasing the playback speed in Quicktime.  The double arrow allows for integer increases in playback speed.  <answer105801> ol liRight click on the iTunes playlist and click strongShow in Finder/strong/li liRight click on the content in Finder and click strongOpen with Quicktime/strong player./li liWhile watching the video/movie press kbdCommand/kbd and then right arrow or left arrow to increase or decrease playback speed, respectively./li /ol  <answer174900> Cmd+K does not work (you can't get to any settings menu), but Cmd+arrows does work with Yosemite. But the next fastest speed seems about 2x, which is hard to listen to.  <answer216695> Folks, you can download Quicktime Player 7, which is for Snow Leopard or later Mac OS, and works with older media files (as well as current ones, it seems). It has the variable speed functionality you're seeking.   No guarantees this link will work whenever you read this, but it's working now, Nov 2015: https://support.apple.com/kb/DL923?locale=en_US  (Why Apple removed this functionality from Quicktime, who knows.)  Once installed, then play the audio file by first locating it in Finder, and use CMD-click to "open with" Quicktime Player 7. Voila.   <answer231972> Works for me on Lion or Mavericks:  ul liCMD+OPTION+ (right arrow) for 1,1x/li liCMD+(right arrow) for 2x/li /ul  <answer260422> macOs Sierra users can use kbdOpt/kbd - RightArrow in Quicktime.  <answer268478> Quicktime Player allows you to play the audio faster, but not slower.  The chosen answer, by @daviesgeek, works for Quicktime Player 7 (Snow Leopard or earlier).  If you're on a later version (well, I only tested this on macOS Sierra and Quicktime 10.4), you can play it faster by doing:  ul liopt + click-on-fast-forward-button. This will increase playback by 0.1x each time./li liopt + right-arrow. This one increases from 1x to 2x to 5x./li /ul  You cannot play at a slower speed though (but you can play backwards at speeds greater than 1x).  <comment55301> And yes, it's annoying that you can trivially do this on an iPod/iPhone but not in iTunes. <comment55302> @geekosaur I know! <comment167520> The Quicktime solution works with Quicktime 7, which is still available for download, as of 8/2014. It does not work with Quicktime 10. <comment206070> @geekosaur how does one accomplish this on an iPhone/iPod? <comment220234> @ProductionValues Select the track in iTunes, and press Command/Control+I, then under the 'Options' tab, change the media kind from 'Music' to 'Audiobook'. But right now, after iOS update, I am not able to sync audio books anymore. <comment228089> Even if you do the work-around in Quicktime, fill out a quick Product Feedback with Apple letting them know you want the feature in iTunes on Mac as well, or it will never be fixed! I don't know about you guys, but I've tried the work-around for an audiobook with 400 files, and it was aaawwwwful. https://www.apple.com/feedback/itunesapp.html <comment228104> Audacity is a good product for this and more as well <comment249045> Cmd+arrows just skips or changes volume for me. <comment356158> This doesn't allow slower, just faster or faster in rewind. 2x is the minimum setting, in either direction. <comment356159> So you can't do 0.5x speed. <comment371118> Does anyone else think this is a stupid problem to have since Winamp and many others solved years ago, but Apple for some reason wants to reinvent the wheel and like their wheel was the original wheel. Its 2017 and we are dealing with problems that were solved back in 1990. Apple made some good computers and devices, but if you keep up this type of behavior people will jump ship and invest in the full switch over.
