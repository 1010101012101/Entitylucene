MAC hanged when submitting app <body> I've submitted my first app to Apple and waiting for approval. My MAC was hanged while I was submitting. I needed to restart MAC. After restarting, the state of app on iTunes connect was 'Waiting For Review'. I am not sure whether binary was uploaded correctly or not. Will Apple Review Team contact me in case binary was not uploaded properly? If yes, how much time it usually takes?  <answer131236> strongWaiting for Review/strong is the status after strongWaiting for Upload/strong, this means your binary should have been uploaded correctly.  However, to be certain - why wouldn't you revoke it and upload it again? Else you have to wait and maybe get a result that the binary is corrupted and you have to wait the emusually pretty long/em period again.  <comment154120> OK. I'll try to revoke it and upload again.  Thanks..!!
