How to Set my Mac's $PATH back the way it was before <body> I'm just getting started with Terminal, the other day I might have messed something up with my codeurs/local/bin/code. When executing codeecho $PATH/code it returns me with code/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin/code the original path was code/usr/local/bin/code How do I set it back to factory settings?  Thanks in Advance for your Help.  <answer218491> By default the paths are saved in the file code/etc/paths/code. You can edit it e.g. with codesudo vim /etc/paths/code. Each line should contain one directory used for $PATH.  Then there is the directory code/etc/paths.d//code that can contain text files with paths in it.  Furthermore the path can be modified in the files code~/.bashrc/code and code~/.bash_profile/code.  hr  However, the $PATH you are stating is the default one and usually desired. Restricting it to only code/usr/local/bin/code would make a lot of default applications - like codevim/code, codels/code, or even codesudo/code that reside in code/usr/bin//code or code/bin//code - inaccessible without typing their whole paths every time.   <comment222025> The $PATH you now have `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` is the default setting.
