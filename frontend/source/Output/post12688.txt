Automatically press a key every 60 seconds <body> Is it possible via Automator, an app, applescript, etc. to automatically press a key (i.e. "g") every 60 seconds?   <answer12692> You can do this in AppleScript, emiff/em you've enabled access for assistive devices:  precodetell application "System Events" to keystroke "," using command down /code/pre  This will (obviously) invoke kbdcmd/kbd-kbd,/kbd.  If, for some reason, you can't enable access for assistive devices, then it's pretty easy to do this in code (by creating a codeCGEventRef/code and then posting it to the system, essentially).  If you'd like help with that, then head over to stackoverflow.com, where that question has been asked a few times.  As for getting this to happen every 60 seconds, you could turn it into a launch agent and let launchd do it for you:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;com.stackexchange.apple.12692&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;Program&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/usr/bin/osascript&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;osascript&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;-e&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;tell application "System Events" to keystroke "," using command down&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;     &lt;key&gt;ServiceDescription&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Auto Keypress&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;         &lt;key&gt;Second&lt;/key&gt;         &lt;integer&gt;0&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre  Toss that in ~/Library/LaunchAgents and you should be good to go (once you load the plist and/or log out and log back in).  <answer13636> Use the "Watch Me Do" to enter "G," then use the pause action to pause for 60 sec, then the loop action and select "Loop Automatically."  <comment13393> @Dave thanks for your reply, unfortunately I can't seem to get this working. I've enabled access for AD and saved your XML as a .plist file in my USER/Library/LaunchAgents folder. Logged out back in, opened TextEdit and let it run for a couple minutes. No comma "," key was pressed. What am I doing wrong? <comment13395> @Ryan it's possible I might have messed up the plist slightly, but it seems to work for me on my system.  You can also try doing `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/filename.plist` in Terminal to explicitly load it. <comment13403> @Dave - that did the trick. Thank you! One last question: how can I change it from "Command"+"," to simply "g"? I tried editing the .plist file but nothing seems to change the behavior. <comment13422> @Ryan when you change the plist, you'll have to "unload" it and "load" it again. <comment13447> @Dave How exactly do I do that? Just change your Terminal command (above) from "load" to "unload"? <comment13455> @Ryan exactly :) <comment14979> @Dave this is working really well! Any chance you know how to speed it up to every 10 seconds (instead of 60)?
