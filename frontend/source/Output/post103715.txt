Possible To Send Pop Ups To Other Router Users? <body> Guys is it possible to send router messages to other users on the same router? Like pop ups? If yes could you please tell me how it works and if it involves hacking then don't worry I am not scaring anyone and this is my own router ;) I am using a Macbook for the record, just to tell you ;)  <comment122070> If you tell us what router you have ?.. <comment122071> You could set up a fake DNS server that shows your own webpage in the browser whenever they try to open any website. You could use javascript on this webpage to open popups. <comment122075> What are the other devices?  If they are all osx or iPad etc simplest is to just use the messages app. <comment122093> What is a router pop up and how does it relate to the messages app? <comment122095> They are trying to replicate the functionality of something like Windows `net send`. <comment122099> No matter what, the nodes will need some configuration, ie a process running to listen and accept the message then display it.
