Unable to start any application <body> Today I tried to rename a few hidden files with the following command in terminal (might be a hint for the solution):  precodefor f in .*; do mv "$f" "_$f"; done /code/pre  Now I wanted to start codevlc/code and all I got was the messagebox to codeignore/code, codereport/code or coderelaunch/code. Most application are not startable, except the few that are loaded (with the dot mark in the dock under the icon).  Non-startable applications:  precodeMessages App Store Mail Calendar iTunes Terminal Notes Chrome Safari VLC Console Boot Camp Assistant /code/pre  Startable applications:  precodeX11 QtCreator JDownloader Grapher Disk Utility /code/pre  In addition, the attempt to run codeMail/code from codeXTerm/code resulted in codeLSOpenURLsWithRole() failed for the application /Applications/Mail.app with error -10810./code   My system is a MacBook running Yosemite 10.10.5.  My guess is that I for some reason renamed system files and I am afraid that after reboot the system won't start.  <answer205652> It looks like a coincidence to me.   Only the files and folder in ~/Movies should be affected.  Even running the command strongemwith sudo in the root/em/strong of my drive doesn't render my system unbootable:  precodefor f in .*; do sudo mv "$f" "_$f"; done /code/pre  Some files and folders are renamed (e.g. _.fseventsd, _.Spotlight-V100, _.Trashes, _.DocumentRevisions-V100, _.vol) but after a restart the important ones will be recreated with the proper name (leaving the renamed folders as they were).  Navigate with Terminal to / and /System/Library/CoreServices and check if anything was renamed; if not reboot otherwise remove all the underscores.  <comment247991> When you ran the command above do you remember which directory you were in inside Terminal? Were you sitting in the root directory? <comment247993> @AlistairMcMillan: i was under `~/Movies/...` <comment247994> @klanomath: thanks, fixed it in the question <comment247997> @Zaiborg Running your command as an admin just returns `mv: rename . to _.: Invalid argument` and `mv: rename .. to _..: Invalid argument` and renames .localized to  _.localized. Did you prepend `sudo` by accident? <comment247998> @klanomath no i did not, i got the error that renaming `.` and `..` is not allowed, the files in that directory were renamed correct <comment248003> can you reproduce the error of applications not starting? <comment248004> @Zaiborg No absolutely not. Do you have any aliases in your bash profile files? <comment248005> `/` and `..../CoreServices` shows no files starting with underscore <comment248007> i know some of those words but i've no idea what that should be <comment248008> do you know something about `LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error  -10810` <comment248011> an alias is a "shortcut" for commands. E.g you may create a file .profile in ~/ with the content `alias f="/usr/bin/blah"`. Then you just have to enter f to execute blah. <comment248012> no application alias were set <comment248013> i am back from reboot, for some reason everything works as expected ... but i wonder what caused that issue
