Setting the config for PHP 5.3.15 and above <body> I have PHP 5.3.15 running on my Mac (OS 10.8.2).  I have Apache running with virtual hosts.  Also, I've installed FreeTDS for connecting to MSSQL.  I still need to configure the /php/ext/mssql to run with /usr/local/freetds and I need to 'make' it.    However, I notice in later versions of PHP 5.3 and up, the following terminal command will not work.  precode./configure --with-mssql=/usr/local/freetds /code/pre  I understand that this is because the configure UNIX executable isn't in later versions.  What is the ./configure equivalent?
