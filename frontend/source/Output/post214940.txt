Vim Explorer "not an editor command" <body> When I open MacVim (installed with homebrew) in the GUI, the Explorer works as expected. But if I open "vim" in a terminal, I've got that message:  precodeE492: Not an editor command: Explorer /code/pre  But the netrw is installed. This is what return :scriptnames  precode4: /usr/local/Cellar/vim/7.4.712_1/share/vim/vim74/plugin/netrwPlugin.vim /code/pre  vim --version  precodeVIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Aug 14 2015 16:38:12) MacOS X (unix) version /code/pre  brew info macvim  precodemacvim: stable 7.4-81, HEAD GUI for vim, made for OS X https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-77 (1905 files, 34M)   Built from source /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.4-81 (1918 files, 35M) *   Built from source From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/macvim.rb ==&gt; Dependencies Recommended: cscope ✔ Optional: lua ✔, luajit ✘ ==&gt; Options --with-custom-icons     Try to generate custom document icons --with-lua     Build with lua support --with-luajit     Build with luajit support --with-override-system-vim     Override system vim --with-python3     Build with python3 support --without-cscope     Build without cscope support --without-python     Build without python support --HEAD     Install HEAD version ==&gt; Caveats .app bundles were installed.

But even without .vimrc or .gvimrc, the Explorer worked correctly in MacVim.  <comment259586> Try just `vi`. Also what do you get with `which vim`? <comment259589> `vi` bring me into `vim` and `which vim` gives  `/usr/local/bin/vim` <comment259643> First try `which -a vim`, you should only get one path. My `vim` is installed at `/usr/bin/vim`. Open your file with full path of `vim` i.e. `usr/bin/vim`. I think you have a third party `vim` installed. `vim` comes pre-packaged with OS X, have a look in your .bashrc and .bashprofile the culprit should be there, creating an alias to the third party command. <comment259915> Yes, you're right, I've got 2 vim, and the one I launch is the one I installed with homebrew. I think I had some conflicts with my vim plugin and the built-in version of vim. But why my vim does'nt find the Editor when launched form the terminal ? I've updated my question with hombrew.
