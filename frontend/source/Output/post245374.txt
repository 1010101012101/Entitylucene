Parallels desktop virtual machines cannot communicate when Mac has no network connection <body> I have two virtual machines running on Parallels desktop (v11 if that makes a difference).  They are operating in Shared network mode.  When I have a wireless or Bluetooth network connection they can communicate between each other fine.  When I lose that connection (phone tether drops out, flying, etc) the virtual machines no longer are able to communicate with each other.  I have also tried the network in Host Only mode to no avail.  Is there some way I can have these virtual machines communicate with each other even when I do not have an external network connection?  <answer247028> From Parallels Knowledge Base the following indicates an internet connection is required for this to work.  No idea why that would be a requirement.  precodeNetwork problems in the virtual machine Article ID: 8978 Created On: Sep 14, 2010 Last Review: Nov 24, 2015 Views: APPLIES TO:      Parallels Desktop for Mac     Parallels Desktop for Mac Pro Edition     Parallels Desktop for Mac Business Edition     Parallels Access  Note: Your Mac must be connected to the Internet for virtual machines to be able to connect. /code/pre  <comment302497> Do you mean it cannot communicate outside its virtual subnet or it cannot communicate with *each other* on the same virtual subnet? <comment302505> It can no longer communicate with each other
