Yosemite Server: Spotlight from client <body> I just bought a Mac mini to use as our office server (Yosemite).  How can I strongsearch the shared folders with Spotlight from my client/strong iMac?  I tried to connect via SMB and AFP (Go  Connect to Server  afp://192.168.178.44). I tried to use Mavericks (my iMac) and my MacBook Air with 10.10 installed.  When I use Spotlight on the server itself, Spotlight will find my test file. The files I am searching for are on a new partition (/Volumes/HD2/dir/sharedfolder/).  I even have added Spotlight as user user and group to my shared folder (Icon with one person and two persons on it).  mdutil -s /Volumes/* (from a client terminal) says  precode/Volumes/team:     Server search enabled. /code/pre  Hope for some help :-) I bought an OSX server because just of Spotlight. Before we used a NAS and needed a better search.  <answer194174> You don't need a Mac running OS X Server in order to take advantage of Spotlight.  Personally, I have a Synology NAS with AFP, SMB and NFS shares that Spotlight has indexed.  (I do avoid SMB because it is much slower than AFP or NFS)  From the strongemclient/em/strong (iMac or Macbook Air) mount the shared folder as you normally would  From terminal on the strongclient/strong run the command:  precodemdutil -i Volumes/&lt;mount-point&gt; /code/pre  The "-i" tells mdutil to enable indexing.  The "-s" only prints the indexing status.  <comment234471> Thanks for your answer. While this is true (afaik) that kind of index will be destroyed when you disconnect the shared volumen (right?)
