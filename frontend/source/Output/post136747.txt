Captive Portal in Mavericks <body> I connected to a public wifi hotspot with my MacBook AIr (Mavericks) and a login window appeared. I can't recall if I first tried to navigate to a website or not. I am familiar with logging into hotspots, where the login details appear in the browser itself. In this case, however, the login details appeared in a separate window (program?).  When I selected the browser, the global menu indicated "Firefox". When I selected the login window, the menu showed "Finder". Is this a (Apple?) captive portal program? It's the first time I've seen it on any OS platform.  <answer136748> It's something built in the system . Sometimes it's able to detect a captive portal and it displays it in a separate window.   As @George Garside pointed out, it's a separate program located at code/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app/code.   Also, if you have a iDevice you'll see a similar feature.   <comment162333> see this answer: http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/74473/46541 <comment162354> It **is** a separate program: /System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app
