Is it Possible To Move Menu Bar To Applications <body> I have just bought a MacBook Pro 15 and I am finding the Menu Bar very difficult to work with.  For example; if the calculator is in the bottom right of the screen an I am focussing my eyes on it I can't even see the Menu bar. If I want to use something from the menu I have to push the mouse 3 or 4 times with the track pad to get up to the menu (e.g. for a convert function) then 3 or 4 times to get back down.  Is it possible to make the menus appear in the applications?  <answer141461> No is the simple answer.  The Mac UI is based on the premise of the application menu always being at the top. The reasoning was that you just have to move the mouse to the top of the screen to ensure you were at the menu, no hunting to find the menu bar on a window that could be anywhere on the screen.  This has been the case since the beginning of Mac OS in the early 1980s  This can get some getting used to if you are coming from Windows.  <answer141506> Short answer: No, it is not possible to modify the Mac UI in that way, any more than it is possible to modify the Windows UI the other way.  Long answer: You could code your own programs to put menus on the window. Mac users will complain bitterly about it. Every time I open Inkscape (which does put it's own menus on the window) I end up using another application's 'Save' on the main window.  You have obviously recently switched from Windows or Linux. Neither method is "better", it's a design choice. Like most other switchers (in both directions) you try to remake the new UI in the image of the old.   <comment166694> Is there a complicated answer that ends in yes? :) e.g. an application that does some sort of compositing and duplicates the contents of the menu bar above the current Window? Why would you be hunting for a window anyway? The menu bar changes based on the active window so presumably you are already working in it. <comment166695> Unlesss an application is written specifically to put menus on the windows(and some java based apps are built this way) then the answer is probably no. <comment166703> @opticyclic there is no complicated answer that gets you to yes here I'm afraid. This is OS X. I can't speak for everyone, but after time, having menus attached to windows start to seem...wrong. <comment166713> Similar to http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/46165/can-i-move-the-top-menu-bar?rq=1 <comment166718> On searching a bit more, it seems like there is an application called DejaMenu that makes the menus available in a popup (although not docking them to the applications themselves) http://gigaom.com/2009/01/20/how-to-add-mac-menus-on-multiple-monitors/ The homepage is down but I found a copy here http://d.asgeirsson.is/Yu6m and it works in Mavericks. <comment166763> If it takes you 3 or 4 moves to get to the top of the screen, you might want to increase your tracking speed (in System Preferences - Trackpad preference pane - Point & Click tab). <comment166766> Coming from Ubuntu Linux I do have have both options available. When I have to constantly push my trackpad to get to the menus I would say it is a bad design choice for larger screens and that having the _option_ to choose which you prefer is "better". <comment166767> That helps. Thanks. <comment166797> â†’ Gordon: please make an answer of your comment since you've seen the real hidden problem and suggested the right fix :). <comment167779> @GordonDavisson Then that means you don't have fine control of the cursor and even with the most speed it takes 2  moves <comment167780> Unfortunately the original screen was 9" now 3-4 times the size so yes you now have to move 3-4 times as far <comment167856> @Mark: tracking speed is not linear -- if you move your finger across the pad slowly, it'll take a couple of moves to get all the way across, of you move faster it'll go further in a single pass. I can get from bottom to top in a single (fast) move on my MBP 15", with the trackpad on anything except the slowest two settings (and even on the second-slowest setting, I can do it if I move my finger fast enough). <comment167859> I use a trackball and same issue with a mouse <comment309834> Move the calculator to the upper left hand of the screen, just under the menu. ??
