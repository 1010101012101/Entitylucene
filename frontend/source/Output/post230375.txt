osascript dialog box is blocking. <body> I'm using osascript to display dialog box from bash script, but it's blocking the script, until i press the 'ok' button.  I wonder if there's a way to make this display window asynchronous.  precodeosascript -e 'tell app "System Events" to display dialog "'"${msg}"'"' /code/pre  This means that the script will continue running and the osascript will run on the background.  <answer230378> You can add ampersand (code&amp;/code) at the end of the line. Quote from bashitout:     A single ampersand &amp; can often be found at the end of a command.  precode ./myscript.py &amp;  /code/pre      This trailing ampersand directs the shell to run the command in the background, that is, it is forked and run in a separate sub-shell, as a job, asynchronously. The shell will immediately return the return status of 0 for true and continue as normal, either processing further commands in a script or returning the cursor focus back to the user in a Linux terminal.   <comment281177> so simple, how could i miss it... anyway, thanks.
