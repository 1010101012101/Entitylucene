iTunes Backup - iOS & Settings only - No Apps <body> Is there a way to backup the iPhone such that none of the apps are included? I can always download the apps from the iTunes App Store after the iPhone is restored. I would like to backup all the settings for Mail, Messages, iCloud, and the OS itself .. but I just don't have enough space on my SSD for the App backups in iTunes.  <answer115764> h2Short Answer/h2  Back up to iCloud and to iTunes. Then, delete the codeMobile Applications/code folder from Windows Explorer/Finder to remove the apps that have been backed up to iTunes.  h2Long Answer/h2  Make sure you read the Apple support page before you get started, but basically, I would recommend backing up to iCloud, which says that it will automatically back up your camera roll, accounts, documents, and settings. Then, do a full backup to iTunes by clicking codeBack Up/code when you plug in your iOS device. and you can remove the folder codeMobile Applications/code on Windows or Mac by navigating to the codeUsers\Music\iTunes\iTunes Media\Mobile Applications/code folder (actual folder names may vary based on operating system).  h2Pictures/h2  h3Deleting the Mobile Applications Folder/h3  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4WB8U.png" alt="enter image description here" Look at the directory path at the bottom of the picture, too.  <comment135448> Very detailed answer.
