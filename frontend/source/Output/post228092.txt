iTerm new window starts minimized? <body> For some reason, whenever I start iTerm or press CMD+N, it starts small in the top left corner, but instantly minimizes to my dock  Is there a config that could be causing this?  Where should I look for commands that execute on iTerm start? Thinking maybe one of my coworkers pranked me??  Thanks  <answer235056> Try this:  ul liIn Preferences under Profiles, select the default profile./li liIn the Window tab in the "Settings for New Window" section, uncheck "Hide after opening."/li /ul
