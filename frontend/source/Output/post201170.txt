How do I stop the dock from moving to my second monitor? <body> I use an external monitor with my Macbook Pro, often to run Windows VMs with a task bar at the bottom.  While trying to use the task bar, I often accidentally summon the dock to the second monitor.  How do I stop the dock from moving?  Note: I'm aware of the option to go back to the old one-space-for-all-displays behaviour.  I don't want to go back to the old behaviour, I want to fix the new one.  Note, repeated: This isn't a duplicate of the question which asks why this happens.  I know emwhy/em it happens, but there's nothing there that would help me to prevent it from happening.  <answer228905> Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent the Dock from moving from monitor to monitor in any version of OS X.  <comment289321> You've made it clear this isn't what you're looking for, but for other people who come along, this link may be useful: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/169719/why-does-my-dock-keep-moving-back-to-my-other-monitor <comment289371> Agreed on both counts :-) <comment294410> Why downvote this? :D <comment371146> This isn't a duplicate of the other question.  That question is asking why the bad behaviour exists, and the answers say why.  There's nothing there about how to stop the bad behaviour.
