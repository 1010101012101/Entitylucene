How do I clear all iCloud sync data without creating a new Apple ID? <body> I'd like to start fresh and clear out all previously synchronized data in my iCloud. Wi-Fi, Passwords, Safari Bookmarks, etc. I haven't found a way to delete these specific items, and I'm having trouble keeping my iPhone and Mac in sync with respect to Wi-Fi networks.  Is there a command to run or file(s) I can delete to basically "start fresh" with my iCloud Sync data while keeping my current Apple ID?
