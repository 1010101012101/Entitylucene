How do I install Flash in the guest account only? <body> Is there a way to install Adobe Flash to the Guest account (only)?  I'd like to install to the Guest account so it gets wiped out on reboot.  I rarely use Flash, so I want to not have to track updates.  Either that, can I install it to a non-Admin account that I can wipe out when I need to.  <answer158628> Yes, Google Chrome has a sandboxed built-in version of Flash.  ol liDownload Chrome./li liNavigate to: Macintosh HD Users Guests/li liRight Click and select "New Folder" and change its name to Applications/li liOpen the Google Chrome disk image and drag Chrome.app to this folder/li /ol  Google Chrome and its Flash player will only be accessible to the Guest user.  <answer173598> Mabe this will do the trick ?  First of all you may need to unhide the hiden files so open terminal and run those commands :  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE  killall Finder /code/pre  To switch back, do the same but substitute FALSE for TRUE.   Now  Login to your guest account, there set chrome as your default browser (or even Firefox)  Then do not logout ! This would erase your session, so use the  on the top right corner use the swich user drop down menue,  Now that you are back again in your Admin account, Find the new temporary guest home folder, under    precode Users/Guest /code/pre  Select all the folders inside of it, And copy them in :   precode /System/Library/User Template/English.lproj/     /code/pre  English or whatever your languish is if you are using your computer in french this should be :  precode  /System/Library/User Template/French.lproj/     /code/pre  as you can see in this folder there was the defaults folders for the guest account  By modifying them you have just modified default appearance of the guest user account You may want to save this folder in a safe place before, in case you want to undo your work.
