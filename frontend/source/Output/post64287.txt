How to use find to get only string sequence, not within other words <body> How do I use the kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdF/kbd find to get only codea/code in the text codea apple/code, instead of highlighting both codea/code and codea/code in the word "apple".  <answer64291> If you search for "a " (note the space after the letter), you'll get all words that end in  the letter a. You could also search for " a " which will show all the words "a" surrounded by spaces on both sides.
