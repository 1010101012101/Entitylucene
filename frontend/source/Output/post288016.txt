How do I disable Do Not Disturb While Driving in iOS 11 if I'm a passenger? <body> Do Not Disturb While Driving in iOS 11 looks like a helpful feature unless I'm a passenger. How do I disable it if I'm an passenger?  <answer288017> If you have a 3D Touch device, 3D Touch the notification on the lock screen and choose the "I'm not driving" option.  If you have a non-3D Touch device, you will need to long-press the notification and then choose the "I'm not driving" option.  <comment363691> I was hoping you had to pull the parking break or convince Siri you werenâ€™t a chat bot.
