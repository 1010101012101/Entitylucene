Run script before every Time Machine backup? <body> I would like to be able to run a embash/em script just before Time Machine runs, every time This script generates some content to be written on a file which needs to be backed up by TM.  I have looked around, but surprisingly no one seemed to have asked this before. Any idea?  <answer149048> That's not possible as far as I know. There aren't any real “hooks” into Time Machine.  However, you can do something emnearly/em as good: you can disable the automatic backups that Time Machine does and run it manually instead:  precode#!/bin/sh  run_your_command_here  run_another_command_here  and_so_on  tmutil startbackup --block --auto  exit 0 /code/pre  Note this bit from man tmutil     The --auto option provides a supported mechanism with which to   trigger "automatic-like" backups, similar to automatic backups   that are scheduled by the system. While this is not identical   to true system-scheduled backups, it provides custom schedulers   the ability to achieve some (but not all) behavior normally   exhibited when operating in automatic mode.   It is not clear to me what the difference is, but it's worth noting that one exists.  <comment175608> And how do you run the script every hour, then? Using launchd? <comment177084> Exactly. I recommend http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/ for making changes to launchd.
