scroll inertia with non Apple devices <body> So I use Logitech and Wacom mouses and tablets.  Is there a way to enable scroll momentum / inertia with non Apple devices across all Mac OS?  Or at least Chrome...  <comment82697> This is a great question. I would like this functionality myself. One interesting thing is FF doesn't do inertia even with a touch pad, so I'm guessing they messed with the scrolling settings there. I'm curious why you need this functionality or if you would just prefer it? <comment82708> We live in a scrolling world. We scroll maybe hundreds of times every day... With inertia you actually have to scroll less. When using a mouse, not having inertia can be uncomfortable... but when using a graphic tablet not having inertia is a real pain.
