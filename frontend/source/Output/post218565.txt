App from Mac app store not installing <body> I am trying to reinstall an app I purchased some time ago. It is not installing. In the console I get the following message:   precodeLaunchServices: Failed to create bundleProxy for bundle com.trankyman.aText /code/pre  <answer218567> codeaText/code MAS version doesn't work El Capitan due to sandboxing. You can switch to non-MAS version for free, by downloading http://www.trankynam.com/atext/downloads/aText.dmg  Check their Facebook page     I am sorry for the late responding. Unfortunately aText Mac App Store version does not work on OSX 10.11 El Capitan. This is not fixable.   aText 'full' version (not sandboxed) still works with OSX 10.11 El Capitan.   Please switch to non-MAS version for free, by downloading http://www.trankynam.com/atext/downloads/aText.dmg   You can also check their video link on their website.  <comment264252> Thanks for the answer, but I am unable to switch because I need the MAS version of the app to switch. And I cannot install the version. <comment264258> @Raymond, If you have installed the MAS version once, you don't need to reinstall it. Just install the trial version. Check the video link I just added.
