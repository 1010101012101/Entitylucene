Deleted iOS 9.3 update file <body> I was having a lot of trouble installing iOS 9.3 on an iPad Air and after a bit of searching around I was advised to delete the update file and try to reinstall.   Having done this, I no longer have the option to try again. When I check for a software update I am notified that I am 'up to date' with 9.2.1  How do I get back the option to upgrade to 9.3?  Any help is much appreciated.   <answer232603> Apple yanked iOS 9.3 for almost all devices which means you can't install it.  <comment284170> Have you restarted your phone yet? <comment284185> It's an iPad I'm doing it on, but yeah, I've restarted it, performed a hard reset, everything. I'm sure Apple will release another update for iOS 9.3 fairy soon, so hopefully a new file will be created. I just wondered if there was a way to get back the one I just deleted. If not, I'll just carry on using 9.2.1 until then. <comment284628> This changed today. [It was rereleased](https://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/03/apple-pulls-ios-9-3-update-for-older-devices-following-activation-problems/). <comment284629> Apple fixed the problem today. Try again.
