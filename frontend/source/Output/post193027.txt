How to close the strange blank white panel on my screen? <body> It's really strange there is often a small white panel on my screen, which can be moved and resized, but I can find no way to close it.  I don't know where it is coming from. Does anyone know what's it and how to close it?

Can you type in the window? <comment230108> Cmd+Q doesn't work ? <comment230157> @KevinGrabher Should not be the stickies app, can't type anything <comment230158> @MatthieuRiegler Doesn't work, only restart can make it disappeared <comment230163> Does it reappear randomly or after reboot? <comment230260> @Kevin Randomly, sometimes it won't appear for a long time, but sometimes it just appeared, not sure what triggers it
