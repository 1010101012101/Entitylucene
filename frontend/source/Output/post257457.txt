How can I remove an iCloud account that is locked from my iDevice? <body> My iPad seller hooked my iPad up to his account to download stupid apps and games I never need. I uninstall those apps, but I can't remove his account because I do not have his iCloud account's password and the Find My Device is on. Plus the account is now locked, so even if I got his password, I couldn't remove it. So how can I remove a locked iCloud, that I have no security info access?  P/S: Please do not recommend reseting my iPad if that isn't the only way you know.  <comment321464> So, is your device now locked? <comment321469> No, it's not locked, but the account is locked. <comment321471> And going into settings and deleting the iCloud account requires a password?  You should just be able to delete it.
