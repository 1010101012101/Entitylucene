Cannot disable "Dark menu bar" on Mac OS X <body> While going through my settings I wanted to try out the "dark menu bar" in the General System Preferences. Now I cannot turn it off. Each time I uncheck the checkbox, it seems to have no effect, it's stuck in dark mode. I've tried booting into Safe Boot as well to see if i could change it there, to no avail.  This seems to also only be for my user, as switching to guest mode works properly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6Ga6bXEFEo  Screencast of the issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNEHhoFzniI  Machine: OS X El Capitan 10.11.16 MBP Retina 15, Mid-2015  Edit: replaced screencasts with jing to youtube so that non-flash users can view the issues  <answer250532> I just tested the following under OS X 10.11.5 and it worked.  ul liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongGeneral/strong and check the strong[âˆš] Use dark menu bar and Dock/strong check box, then close strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liCopy and paste the following emcommand line/em into strongTerminal/strong, then press kbdenter/kbd.  precodedefaults delete .GlobalPreferences AppleInterfaceStyle; killall -HUP Dock /code/pre/li /ul  After executing the above emcommand line/em, the strongDock/strong momentarily disappeared and a couple seconds later the strongmenu bar/strong was the emdefault/em color once again.  <comment311159> Screencast unfortunately requires Flash :/ <comment311189> Thanks for the reply, but this didn't seem to work. here's a screencast of my attempt: http://screencast.com/t/d54rD52mLd <comment311196> Here's a youtube video instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNEHhoFzniI <comment311197> youtube version of the attempt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAM637YA4Dw   i tried both unchecking and checking that before running the command. <comment311202> @dmachiavello, What happens if you use the following command line instead? `defaults delete $HOME/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleInterfaceStyle; killall -HUP Dock` and do it in Terminal, not iTerm. <comment311205> Looks like the same thing (nothing). Attempt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxS9Lnv-1pE <comment311207> Also, for completeness, i logged into guest mode and was able to prove that it works fine for guest. My suspicion is that it's my user preferences that are corrupted.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6Ga6bXEFEo
