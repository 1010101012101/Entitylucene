Can I manually choose which files to upload to iCloud Photos library? <body> Currently I have disabled the iCloud photos library because I have only 5GB which I need for other things. But I would like to upload some pictures from my iPhone to use the share capabilities. I am afraid when I enable it, it will start to upload all my photos. Can I control which photos should be uploaded and which not?  <comment326197> Not really, it's an all-or-nothing sync.  You can share individual photos but if you have a lot then it's very time-consuming.  Another option might be to use Dropbox or some other cloud storage and just upload the photos you want to share.  Then you can give the public url out to whomever you want.
