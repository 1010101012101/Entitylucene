Why are the same characters displayed differently in the same sentence? <body> In some text views on OS X, e.g. in the application QQ, the character →(U+2192) is displayed differently after a Chinese character or Latin character:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/93wMm.png" alt="right arow"  Also affected are the other arrows, and the box ■(U+25A0):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/395gK.png" alt="box"  How is it so?  <answer198292> It's probably because the app continues to use the Chinese font for that character, and different fonts will often have slightly different glyphs for such symbols.    <comment237213> QQ is a chat/messenger app. Its text capability are limited. Use double space to try.
