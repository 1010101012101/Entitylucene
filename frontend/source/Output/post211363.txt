How to take a screenshot of the same precise region with a key combo? <body> I have a certain location on my screen that I would like to take a screenshot of rather frequently for a project.  Is there a way to set a key binding that would allow one to press a certain combination of keys that will grab that region and output it to a PNG?  <answer211366> This is quite easy to do.  The Built in strongScreencapture/strong has a command line option to capture a rect area. This is a rectangle with a screen coordinate point, width and hight,  x,y,w,h  We can use this in an Automator.app strongService/strong workflow and then give the service that it creates a hotkey/shortcut in the strongkeyboard services system preferences/strong.  First we create the Service workflow in Automator.  Open Automator and a new strongService/strong Workflow document.  Set :   strongservice receives:/strong none  strongIn :/strong Any Application   Add a strongRun Applescript/strong action.  Type or paste this code into the strongRun Applescript/strong action, replacing the default code.  precode  set theDate to do shell script "date +%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S" set theTempPath to POSIX path of (path to desktop) set thePath to theTempPath &amp; "screenCapture_" &amp; theDate &amp; ".png"   do shell script "screencapture -R320,210,848,440 -tpng" &amp; space &amp; quoted form of thePath /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wpGUd.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The code above will create a timestamp string to add onto the end of the file name.  This serves two purposes, 1, you can visually see when they where taken, 2 and more important, the files will no be overwritten by the next capture as the name will be different.  strong-R320,210,848,440/strong  is the Rect option: x,y,w,h    strong-tpng/strong   is the file type format option: png  strong&amp; space/strong  we need a space between the options and the next part of the command.  **&amp;quoted form of"  escapes spaces and illegal characters that the command line will error at if we do not guard against them.  strong&amp; thePath/strong  adds  the file output path which includes the file name  The ampersands strong&amp;/strong  are applescript syntax to say this strongand/strong this.     hr  Save the Service. You will be prompted to give it a name.  Now open the system Preferences and go to the keyboard system pref. Then the Shortcuts Tab and finally the services selection panel.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kupB3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"   Scroll right down to the bottom to the strongGeneral/strong group  Select your service and give it a shortcut. ( remember to use one that does not clash with any other apps you have that use shortcuts: I show I used kbdCmd/kbd + kbdshift/kbd +kbdR/kbd, but I changed it in mine as I found a clash with Safari reader shortcut)  In most cases the shortcut will be picked up by apps straight away but some may need to be closed and reopened.  hr  An aside:  The files are set to land on the desktop.  You can change this in a couple of ways.   But to save me adjusting this for everyone, the easiest thing to do is add a strongmove finder items action/strong  First add this bit of code to the end of the code above:  precodereturn (POSIX file thePath) as alias /code/pre  This will pass on the file path to the next Automator action.  Then add a  strongmove finder items action/strong and choose your destination from it's dropdown menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rsAk3.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211388> Keyboard Maestro can do this with a macro such as…                 img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ih9CW.png" width="519"  <comment255143> I see you set your Automator Service to ⇧⌘R however it's used by AirDrop and will be in conflict when the Finder or Desktop has focus. <comment255146> Thanks, And Safari. I change mine to something else. I was not suggesting what shortcut people use. As There are too many apps out they that individuals use that what ever I suggest may clash with <comment255159> You have an interesting definition of "quite easy"! <comment255169> @MarkHenderson it is easy. It not using any third party app. And the only thing you need to work out is your rect.  The screens 0,0  point is Top left. Which is the x,y. You workout how far right from the left edge. This is the x, How far from the top edge, This is the y. The x,y form a point. The you work out your width from that point and your hight  from that point. The forms your rect. All just because it is a long post does not mean it is a long process to set up. It should only take a couple of minutes. <comment255171> I really like your detailed answer, but the clean and clear option by Keyboard Maestro seems to trump other options I've seen now. <comment255175> @ylluminate no problem, not everyone wants to use third party apps when the built in ones can do the something. :- ) For myself I can setup so I can enter a different rect if I want without redoing it in the service. But thats a little bit more involved than was needed here. <comment255228> Yep, thanks much.  Good to know and document regardless.
