Is it possible to share an Ethernet connection to a secure wireless network in OS X on a MacBook Pro? <body> I can share my Ethernet Internet connection to WiFi clients using System Preferences, but I'm wondering if/how I can make that network secure (WPA) and not broadcast the network name?  <answer51154> Go to the Search bar System Preferences - Sharing -  Internet Sharing - Share your connection from ethernet - to computers using Wifi - Wifi Options - Security WEP 128 Bit  This thread is the same as How to share internet with WPA/WPA2 security?
