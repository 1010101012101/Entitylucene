USB Device Does Not Appear with USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter <body> Some USB devices do not appear when plugging them in through the USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter from Apple, but other devices do. My iPhone and a newer flash drive work just fine through the adapter's USB port, but my GoPro and an Android test phone are not recognized by my 2017 15" MacBook Pro.  Could this be an issue with USB 2.0 devices?  How can I get these devices to be recognized by my computer when plugged in through the USB-C adapter?
