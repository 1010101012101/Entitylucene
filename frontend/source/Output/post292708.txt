How to copy same range from multiple worksheets and paste into a new worksheet with Separate columns <body> I have maybe 60-70 sheets in one excel file. I want to copy a specific range (say A1:A100) from all the the sheets and paste them into a separate workbook with different columns. So if I have 60 sheets, I'll have 60 columns in the new workbook. I would like to do this in VBA code. I have something that does some of this   But the problem with this is that it is all pasted into one column. Anyone know how to get into separate columns? Thanks!!   <comment369282> On a Mac? What version of Office? <comment369285> Welcome to Ask Different. :) Unfortunately, your question doesn't provide enough detail for us to help you. Could you please edit your question (there's an edit link below it) to add info such as: (1) What @bjbk was asking? (2) To clarify exactly what you're wanting to do, as it's a little unclear. That is, initially your question reads like you **want** to copy each sheet into a single column, but then you say _the problem with this is that it is all pasted into one column_. So clarifying this would help ensure you're getting relevant answers. <comment369319> As per the other comments but you should show your code as that is what your question is about - then people may be able to help.
