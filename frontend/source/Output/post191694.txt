Transmit temporary file structure <body> Transmit normally stores files at: ~/Users/esemrow/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/300C3B29-9684-443B-9784-9316236D5795/index.php  Is there a way to have it mimic the remote file structure? e.g. ~/Users/esemrow/Library/Caches/Cleanup At Startup/Transmit/domain.com/www/site/public_html/my_folder/index.php  <answer191709> Not as far as I know currently, no.
