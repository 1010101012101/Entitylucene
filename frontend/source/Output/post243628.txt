HTML files not displaying correctly iOS <body> I am trying to email an html file with some charts in it and it doesn't show any of the content if I open in the Mail app on iOS except a bulleted point, whereas it is fine in a browser or any other email client. I tried downloading it but it still doesn't give the option to open it in Safari or any compatible app, where I think it would display properly.  <comment300051> Does the file have links to the charts or is it all embedded <comment300052> It is all embedded
