Finder Window flash and disappears on unminimize <body> You can clearly see what's wrong with Finder in the GIF. When I click the Finder window, it appears to restore the window, and then it's gone. This usually happens after a while. It's very annoying, a quick fix is to strongForce Quit/strong Finder, and I can restore those windows again.  ol liThere is only 1 Desktop spaces enabled/li liI have tried removing code~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.finder.plist/code/li liMy MacBook's version is macOS Sierra 10.12 latest version. If my memory is correct, I have seen this kind of problem before updating to Sierra (when I was using El Capitan)/li liI also tried removing the saved state from code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.apple.finder.savedState/code/li /ol  img src="https://i.imgur.com/Tk9xLom.png" alt="SysInfo"  img src="https://giant.gfycat.com/PeacefulJealousErin.gif" alt="GIF"  Is there anyway to fix this? Please tell me if more information or log files are required. Thank you.  <comment320723> I think it's the gravitational field strength of the nearby earth mass. You should choose a wider orbit or a different - that is to say smaller - planet <comment320739> @klanomath I'll change it to pluto and see if the window can withstand the gravitational pull. LoL, your comment made my day. <comment321057> Have you tired disabling the animation for dock in preferences? <comment358519> I have no animations but it happens to me for Terminal window sometimes. It is not about savedstate, but more about graphics. I could not find an reliable way to fix it -- just restart the application. <comment358585> Somehow it doesn't happen to me anymore. I think some application that I was using interfered with the minimizing and maximizing.
