metasploit nmap VMware Fusion 5 <body> Has anyone had success using nmap within msfconsole to target a specific host on a VM virtual network?  For example, the following command works from a Terminal prompt:  precodenmap -sT -A 172.16.187.128 /code/pre  However, the same command run from msfconsole results in     dnet: Failed to open device vmnet  precodemsf &gt; nmap -sT -A 172.16.187.128 [*] exec: nmap -sT -A 172.16.187.128 Starting Nmap 6.25 ( http://nmap.orgz) at 2013-06-04 00:23 MDT dnet: Failed to open device vmnet2 QUITTING! /code/pre  I've seen some answers on the Internet suggesting the problem is the virtual network, but since the same nmap command works from Terminal I have doubts about the answers I've seen.  Thanks!  <answer106837> For what its worth I've seen the same issue with Fusion 6 and nmap.  I also saw tcpdump fail as well:  precodesudo tcpdump -i vmnet8 tcpdump: vmnet8: No such device exists (BIOCSETIF failed: Device not configured) /code/pre  After upgrading libpcap to 1.40 and this still not resolving the problem, I found the following outdated post: https://communities.vmware.com/message/693833#693833  Specifically this quote is where the issue lies: code"No guarantees, but we can try to take a look at implementing BPF on Fusion's network interfaces in a future release."/code  This seems to point to the issue being a vmware problem, so I tried VirtualBox 4.3.0 and when using NAT at least, the issues do not occur (nmap also worked for me):  precode$ ifconfig â€¦ vboxnet0: flags=8843&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1500 ether 0a:00:00:00:00:00 inet 192.168.56.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.56.255  $ sudo tcpdump -i vboxnet0 tcpdump: WARNING: vboxnet0: That device doesn't support promiscuous mode (BIOCPROMISC: Operation not supported on socket) tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode listening on vboxnet0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes /code/pre
