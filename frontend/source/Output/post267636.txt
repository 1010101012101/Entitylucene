Mac terminal strange output on return <body> Using the Mac terminal whenever I hit enter, regardless of shell it outputs the line with square brackets. The issue doesn't occur in iTerm2.   precodeDan@Mac ~                                                            [10:32:55]  [&gt; $                                                                            ]  Dan@Mac ~                                                            [10:36:11]  [&gt; $                                                                            ]  Dan@Mac ~                                                            [10:36:11]  &gt; $      /code/pre  So above is what there term looks like, input goes at  $ however on enter it shows with [ $.  Any advice appreciated, let me know if you need any other details.   edit: To clarify as this was marked duplicate of another thread which asks the functionality/purpose of mark, when posting this I did not know what mark was or that it existed.   <answer267641> Found the reason, in the terminals settings under edit there is an option called mark.   Seems this is designed to mark the prompt line, once disabled this behaviour stops.
