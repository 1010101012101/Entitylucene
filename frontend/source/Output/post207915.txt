Drag to convert Automator Action into Applescript <body> In Automator, there is a way to quickly convert an Action into its equivalent Applescript in Automator, I think by dragging it in some tricky way.   I saw this some time ago but have now forgotten. I've tried searching and can't find it.  <answer207945> It's impossible. You can do similar actions in applescript, but there is no way to convert an existing automator script to applescript.  <answer261841> Create your Automator file as an "Application" type.  Tell your AppleScript to run your Automator app.  Something like:   precodeopen "/Users/george/AutomatorFiles/MyScript.app" /code/pre  Works for me!   <answer268444> In case anyone has this question, I found it, but it only works for recorded actions.  After you Record some clicks or other actions in Automator, they appear in a "Watch Me Do" action. You can then click on and drag an individual action out of that Action and release when the + sign appears. Automator will add a "Run AppleScript" action with the AppleScript that sends the same clicks and key presses to System Events.    You can also simply Copy the action you want, switch over to AppleScript Editor, and paste to get the same code.   Example: "Click Skype in the Dock" Event converts to the following AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     -- Click “Skype” in the Dock.     delay 7.872251     set timeoutSeconds to 2.000000     set uiScript to "click UI Element \"Skype\" of list 1 of application process \"Dock\""     my doWithTimeout( uiScript, timeoutSeconds )     return input end run  on doWithTimeout(uiScript, timeoutSeconds)     set endDate to (current date) + timeoutSeconds     repeat         try             run script "tell application \"System Events\" " &amp; uiScript &amp; " end tell"             exit repeat         on error errorMessage             if ((current date) &gt; endDate) then                 error "Can not " &amp; uiScript             end if         end try     end repeat end doWithTimeout /code/pre  How to convert recorded events in Automator:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/esYmx.png" alt="Click and event and drag to create a new action" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bWpwY.png" alt="Automator converts the event to Applescript"  <comment250847> Probably because it's not possible. AppleScript commands and Automator actions are different, some app may support one while not the other. Both are to do repetitive tasks, but different. <comment337066> That's useful too, though not quite what I was looking for, which was to see the code so I can understand and reuse it. <comment337067> Might be generally true (I don't know), but it is possible for the recorded actions ("Watch Me Do") - see my solution below. <comment337123> I up voted this on its merits of how you gather AppleScript code from a Watch Me Do action however you said "_You can also simply Copy the action you want, switch over to AppleScript Editor, and paste to get the same code._" and while this might be true in some cases nonetheless it's not true in some cases as the AppleScript Code cannot always be copied exactly from Automator in this manner to AppleScript Editor and run successfully without modifying the code.
