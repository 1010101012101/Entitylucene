App settings are missing in the Settings app <body> I cannot seem to find my app settings in the setting app after updating my iphone to iOS 10.3 beta 4 (14E5260b).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRFWj.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The issue is still present even after waiting a night, so it's not an issue about apps taking a long time to load.  Were they moved or strongremoved/strong? If they were moved, can you tell me where I could now find them?  <answer278100> This appears to be a bug in iOS and quite an old one at that. It may be caused by an app providing bad settings metadata, but I haven't yet found the true cause. I've seen two solutions work.  Your best bet is to try just killing and reopening the Settings App. I've seen this work on at least a few occasions so it should be your first attempt. However, if that fails you, another solution that I've seen work is to go into Settings-General-Reset and choose Reset All Settings.  However, be warned, you'll lose literally all your settings, including passcodes, fingerprints, wifi, device name, etc. etc.  <answer278103> I experienced this issue for the first time this morning, on iOS 10.3. To fix, I simply opened multitasking view (double-click strongHome/strong), and ejected the strongSettings/strong app. Upon reopening it, app settings returned beneath emTV Provider/em.  Iâ€™m quite surprised at the number of bugs with the strongSettings/strong app since iOS 10 (another would be the disappearing navigation arrow in the upper-left).  <comment345768> Could be a bug. I'm on the same beta with no problems. Maybe try force restarting the phone - if that doesn't work, file a bug report using the Feedback app <comment345770> It also takes my phone, as always, several seconds to a minute to register all the apps. I have always had this problem and this beta version hasn't really helped my phone with issues like these <comment345832> @Jackson1442 Night has passed for me and the apps are still not there. I'm going to try to test out the other person's suggestion. <comment345833> @NoahL I'm going to try a hard reset; can you make that into an answer so I can accept it if it works? <comment371448> I swept closed all the apps on my phone immediately after opening settings (closing it too) and they came back - so far I have closed and reopened 4 times. Couldn't view them twice in a row ever since yesterday. Hard boot did NOT close the apps. They were still open after the restart. Apple support could not even help me. I found this by accident
