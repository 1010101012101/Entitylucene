How can I stop the very frequent beachballs I have on my 2010 MacBook Pro, which has 8 GB RAM? <body> Beachballs happen every five minutes or so, taking about 15-30 seconds to resolve. I almost never had them before a few weeks ago.   Update: Just now, for the first time, the Mac was unresponsive for about 30 seconds when I physically opened it to bring it out of sleep. The screen was black. I pressed various keys with no effect.

Once that's done, you'll want to run Disk Utility to see if the drive can be erased and get a clean start or if you need to have the hardware serviced.  Also, when the kernel logs an IO error, my experience is you almost certainly have a hardware problem or at best a software corruption that an erase and reinstall of the OS should alert you if the IO errors go away after a wipe. Keep in mind, with bad data on storage, you can't always trust the logs or even Disk Utility to self-repair things and might need another computer to repair/diagnose things.  <answer122030> You have few disk I/O problems showing (not a good news), so do the disk repair with the Disk Utility locate in your utility folder.  Also your Firefox and your Google are having some problems. Make sure they are updated.  <answer122124> Your problem... disk0s2: I/O error.  I had this on my iMac. Disk repairs and a reformat of the disk cleaned me up for a few weeks, but with in 2 months of getting this error, my hard disk was dead and would no longer boot.  Dead disk was confirmed and replaced at the Apple store.  <answer122141> I hate to say this, but get a new HDD (An SSD if you can afford one).  <comment142328> If you would publish like 20-30 lines of your Console so we can take a look, please <comment142330> Thanks, I published some lines. <comment142333> Thanks. What do you mean by Google? Chrome? <comment142334> Do you have time machine making backups since before the slowness started? <comment142335> Yes Chrome, but it is not so Important, you are having more serious problem with your disk. Hope you use backup if not do it before it is to late. <comment142336> Thanks. I just ran Repair Disk and it seemed to say everything was fine. I posted the results. <comment142337> Thanks. I just ran Repair Disk and it seemed to say everything was fine. I posted the results. <comment142338> Do you have more than one disk showing? <comment142340> There's "250.06 GB Hitachi HTS5...." In a sub-menu beneath it there's "Macintosh HD." Next down, "SuperDrive." Next, after a divider, "decryptedFile.dmg," under which, in a sub-menu, is "Flash Player." <comment142341> Thanks bmike--when I went to Time Machine, it was not set up and its switch was set to off. I'm trying to set it up now. It says "No configured AirPort base stations have been found." <comment142343> ok you 2 disks, check the Macintosh HD <comment142352> Time Machine would be easiest to enable if you have a USB hard drive you could plug in. It needs to be formatted for Mac, so if you insert a PC drive, it will get erased if you select it for Time Machine - so read the warnings carefully if you don't have a blank drive handy to start Time Machine. <comment142386> For your information: I started to get the beach-ball (for very short periods), I stopped using Chrome, and the associated culprit the Google Chrome Helper (which is the one doing it). The beach-ball did not show since. <comment142388> Verifying volume “Macintosh HD”Checking file systemPerforming live verification.Checking Journaled HFS Plus volume.Checking extents overflow file.Checking catalog file.Checking multi-linked files.Checking catalog hierarchy.Checking extended attributes file.Checking volume bitmap.Checking volume information.The volume Macintosh HD appears to be OK. <comment142389> Thanks for the tip about Chrome, but I haven't used it in days. Did you uninstall it? <comment142392> No need to uninstall, just do not use the Chrome as browser. Back to your problem, since the Disk Utility did not find a permanent disk error-- please run the Console again and type the Disk in the filtering (search window), now you should see only disk messages, so publish those to see who is initiating them. <comment142472> Repair Disk will check the structural integrity of the filesystem's internals, checking inodes and pointers and other such complicated stuff. It will not read each file end to end to seek corruption or media failure at an individual file level. It seems you have a a dead bit of disk that doesn't realise it's dead, and is not detectable at an FS level. I would be backing up, likely more will follow. <comment142481> Thanks. What was the cost at the Apple store? Did you price out any other options? <comment142482> Thanks. What's the best seller? <comment142723> Sorry. I had Apple Care. I believe they said it would have been between $2-300, but I realize that is a big span and not very helpful. <comment142740> That is helpful, thanks. Just to update, the Mac seems to work OK if I only have a browser, and no other applications, open, and as long as there are only three or four tabs open. But this wasn't previously the case, and as I said there are 8 GB RAM. Does this parallel your experience?
