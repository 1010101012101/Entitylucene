Accent menu gone in Mavericks? <body> I'm unable to get the accent menu to show up when I hold down a key. Do I have to enable the long-press accent menu in Mavericks somehow manually?   <answer118669> Got it working by adding a second language in the strongLanguage &amp; Region/strong pref pane and rebooting.  Now the menu shows up.  <comment138407> What apps are you trying it with? Do you have any apps that might customise the keyboard (KeyRemap4MacBook, etc)? <comment138436> So you only had one language in that list to start with?  Had you removed some earlier or was it that way from the beginning? <comment138599> Had only one language in the list to start with
