How to show iTunes albums with multiple different year tags <body> The metadata of my iTunes collection is all kinds of messed up, and in the case of remasters of old albums, some tracks often have the year tag of the original release year (eg. '1969'), while others have the year tag of the remaster (eg. '2008').  Is there any easy way of getting a list of all the albums that have mixed year tags? I really want to clean that mess up.
