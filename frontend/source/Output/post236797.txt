Reducing System Volume <body> How do I halve the system volume?  I want one bar (out of sixteen) of volume to be as loud as half a bar etc.  How does one do this?  <answer236850> There is no way to do this, as you can't set a volume restriction (as you can with iOS) and no apps that I know of can do this. One thing you can do, however, is hold down strongoption/strong and strongshift/strong as you change the volume (Lion or newer, including El Capitan) and it will change in one-quarter-notch increments, allowing for the greater precision I think you desire.  <comment289997> Ah, that's really useful. Thanks!
