Activating NightMode (Do Not Disturb) at a designated time of night? <body> I am often on call for work, if my phone rings it's very important that I can answer it. I set the ringer on loud when I go to bed to wake me if called.   However the contract only covers certain times so I don't want to be distracted by every notification/message coming in when I am not on duty.  Is it possible to configure Night Mode to come on automatically at (for example) midnight?  I've looked into some of the Alarm/Timer functions which offer a few options "When Alarm  Ends" but I've not seen what I'm looking for.  <answer147515> Do Not Disturb has Manual or Timer modes, though it is fixed times, not 'until alarm goes off'  Details at Use Do Not Disturb on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch  With Do Not Disturb, you can silence calls, alerts, and notifications that you get while your device is locked.
