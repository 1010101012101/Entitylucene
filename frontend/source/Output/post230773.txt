Error while trying to create an account in single user mode on OS X Mavericks <body> On OS X Mavericks, I am trying to create an account using single user mode, using the following script.  precode#! /bin/bash  # create user dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser UserShell /bin/bash dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser RealName "Hidden User" dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser UniqueID "401" dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser PrimaryGroupID 20 dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser dscl . -passwd /Users/hiddenuser password /code/pre  However, when I run this script, I get 6 copies of the same error:  code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist: No such file or directory/code  How do I fix this? Do I need to download a new /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist ?  Thanks  Note: I have tried changed 401 to other values below 501, and I am getting the same result.  <answer230780> After starting in Single User Mode enter:  precode/sbin/fsck -fy /sbin/mount -uw / /code/pre  Launch opendirectoryd:  precodelaunchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.opendirectoryd.plist /code/pre  em/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServicesLocal.plist/em doesn't exist anymore!  Then execute:  precodedscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser UserShell /bin/bash dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser RealName "Hidden User" dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser UniqueID "401" dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser PrimaryGroupID 20 dscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser NFSHomeDirectory /var/hiddenuser dscl . -passwd /Users/hiddenuser password /code/pre  The commands yield errors but the user is properly created. Executing code/bin/bash /path/to/script.sh/code directly after loading emopendirectoryd/em didn't work for me for no apparent reason. strongOn a second attempt using a UID 500 it worked though!/strong  In strongYosemite and more recent OS X versions/strong creating a hidden user like this is not recommend. Instead use a free UniqueID 500 and use an additional command:  precodedscl . -create /Users/hiddenuser IsHidden 1 /code/pre  <comment281726> @MarkWright You posted a different bash script yesterday in a meanwhile deleted question. Please also include the "second half". <comment281727> I assume you've executed the commands: `fsck -fy` and `mount -uw` to check the disk and then mount it with write access? You may also need to preface each command with `sudo`. <comment281737> @Klanomath it is the first half that is causing the errors. Should I still post the second half? <comment281738> @IconDaemon yes I did `/sbin/fsck -fy` and `mount -uw /`. I tried prepending `sudo` to each command, but I am getting the same error messages. <comment281748> Does `ls -l /System/Library/LaunchDaemons` list some plists or does it give you a "No such file..." error? <comment281749> Also, see https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT4749 <comment281752> @patrix I am able to list the LaunchDaemons directory, and it has a lot of com.apple.something's, it seems to just be missing the DirectoryServicesLocal.plist one. <comment281753> Did the user get created actually? HT4749 implies that you can ignore the error message (assuming you've started OpenDirectory first) <comment281776> Let us [continue this discussion in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/36889/discussion-between-mark-wright-and-klanomath). <comment283718> Just giving you a bounty - you helped me a ton, and I greatly appreciate it! <comment283859> @MarkWright Thanx a lot ;-)
