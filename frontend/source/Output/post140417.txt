How would my friend install my iOS application without App Store? <body> I am developing my first serious application for iOS and I am doing it for my friend (not for public use). So it will be a gift. Now question: How would my friend be able to instal this application? Is there any easy way to share my app with him? I am very confused on how I can share my app on private basis with few people only and how they can easily install it.  <answer140420> You can share apps you develop by means of Ad-Hoc distribution. This involves adding the UDID of their device to your developer account (and consequently a provisioning profile) which lets you install the app on devices outside of the App Store.  For more information on Ad-Hoc distribution, see:  ul lihttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/TestingYouriOSApp/TestingYouriOSApp.html/li /ul  Apple does not operate a private App Store for non-apple use other than the custom business store and it's unlikely individuals would be accepted into that program so you have to self host the content as described above.   <answer140422> There should be a button to generate a code that allows you to download the app from the App Store for free somewhere in the developer panel.  <comment165521> I've edited the question to have one question. The price means nothing with respect to letting everyone see and buy the app. <comment275949> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/982476/iphone-app-without-appstore
