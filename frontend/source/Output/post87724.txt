Manage /etc/hosts from menu bar <body> Some years ago, I recall a menu bar application that would allow you to activate/de-activate host entries in /etc/hosts.  I can't seem to find it via google.  Anyone have recommendations?  <answer87749> It is not a menu bar item, but this preferences pane called Hosts is by far the best code/etc/hosts/code manager I tried. And you can enable or disable entries easily.  <answer91199> You are looking for Gas Mask. Itâ€™s so useful!
