I also have same Apple id  <answer171899> Make sure you have your Contacts set to be backed up to iCloud on both devices. Settings  iCloud  Contacts. (The switch next to Contacts need to be pushed to the right and displaying green.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xxutU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment202320> are both phones using the same appleid?
