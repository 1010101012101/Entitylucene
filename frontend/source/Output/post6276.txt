Multiple users on one machine and Dropbox <body> If UserA logs in to an OS X machine (at the GUI) and starts Dropbox, UserB logs in via ssh and adds a file to their Dropbox, will Dropbox work for UserB? Or does UserB need to log in via the GUI also, and then "switch" (not log out) to UserA?  <answer6284> The Dropbox app runs as the logged-in user, and uses user-specific preferences to determine which Dropbox it's associated with and where the local Dropbox folder is located, so I'd assume that means that it only works for the logged-in user. There's only one way to find out for sure though - try it and see! :)  <answer6288> DropBox does not support not-logged-in users. The solution seems to be the following:  Log in and start Dropbox from the command line:  precodealias dropbox='/Applications/Dropbox.app/Contents/MacOS/Dropbox &amp;' dropbox # start it.  ps aux | grep -i dropbox # shows multiple instances running /code/pre  The above technique seems to work. Error messages are sent when the second Dropbox launches:  precodealready someone listening at socket  RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL. /code/pre  But everything appears to work.  <comment6589> I've tried it and it doesn't work, but I thought it is supposed to support this setup. <comment6636> log in via ssh?! I didn't know dropbox supported that. are we talking about apple "drop box" or http://www.dropbox.com ? <comment6637> Log into the Mac running the Dropbox.com desktop client. I have tried to clarify the question.
