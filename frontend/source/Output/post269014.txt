Can the right click area on the trackpad of the new MacBook Pro 15" be adjusted? <body> On my new MacBook Pro 15" gigantic trackpad, the right click area is tiny, can this be adjusted in any way?   I keep missing it now, and need to force my pinky to move in an completely un-natural way to activate it.  I have the idea that on my previous macs the right click area was almost 50% but now it seems it's more like 20%.  <comment337915> You can't change the right click area with macOS. However, you can do the following: (1) right click while holding CTRL, (2) right click using a two-finger-click. (3) You may also try BetterTouchTool (BTT). Someone tried to do the _reverse_ and succeeded: http://superuser.com/questions/350164/define-right-click-area-for-macbook-pro-trackpad
