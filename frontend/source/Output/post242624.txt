Scrolling list on calendar <body> How do I get the scroll listing of all my events on my calendar? It is not showing up to the end of the year. It only shows a dot under the date on the monthly calendar. I had it before but it is now gone. Was there an upgrade done for the calendar?  <answer242628> Hope that helps:  Mac Os X:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sv1Vg.png" alt="mac calendar"  iOS:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XAens.jpg" alt="ios calendar"  Please strongdo not/strong use only capitals as it is considered impolite.  <comment298538> Are you referring to iOS or OS X (on a Mac)?
