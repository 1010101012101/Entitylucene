Can you set custom ringtones for contact groups? <body> In iPhone, you can easily change the default ringtone (Settings → Sounds → Ringtone) and set a custom ringtone for individual people (Contacts → [some person] → Edit → Ringtone).   But can you set a custom tone for a emgroup of contacts/em? (E.g. "family" or "workmates".)  I think that would be handy—and quite embasic/em functionality, so to speak—but I couldn't find a way to do this through the iPhone UI. Is it possible at all (without jailbreaking)?  <answer3076> It is unfortunately not (yet or ever?) officially supported as a feature of iOS.  <answer23223> yes, you can assign ringtones to contact groups on iPhone using Grouptones tweak ($2.99 in Cydia, requires jailbreak).   See http://grouptonesapp.com for details!  <answer55216> Just use this app: GRingtones, it is a group managing app.  The most important feature is that GRingtones could set a ringtone for each group!  ol liSetting a group ringtone/li liSetting a text tone for a group/li liGroups could be created, edited, or deleted free./li liSearching for contacts is also supported./li /ol  <answer136285> It had this feature on my 3Gs. I know because I just upgraded to the 4s and it's not there. They changed it.   <comment2718> Well, that sucks. As you say *yet*, do you happen to know of any evidence that it might be added in a future iOS version? <comment2719> No evidence, but Apple has a trend of constantly improving its phone features, as it did when it allowed the sending of a message to multiple recipients, sharing contacts, etc., so we'll just have to be hopeful. <comment2724> +1 for a good question! Normal phones have had this basic feature for more than a decade, and yet it's still missing in the iphone. Boo Apple! <comment2725> Though for this specific feature, they haven't added it in any of the last releases. How many releases has there been so far, twenty?! I wouldn't hold my breath. Yet another reason to jailbreak and look for non-Apple-approved hacks. <comment83911> The question asked for a solution without requiring a jailbreak. <comment83915> Consider the reviews before buying this app! <comment91181> Answer still helped me, exactly what I was googling for. +1 <comment136827> What about using a 3rd party app, yet without jailbreaking? <comment149340> @patrix What do you mean? The reviews are 5 stars... is it some kind of dangerous app? How is it able to do this when everyone says it's impossible? <comment149363> @GregoryMagarshak As far as I remember the app didn't really fulfill all the requirements back in 2012. But it seems to have improved significantly since. <comment161629> Welcome to Ask Different! You've posted this as an answer, which is only for things that directly answer the question asked.
