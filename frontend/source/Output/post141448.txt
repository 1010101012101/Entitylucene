Iphone reminder is different <body> I have IOS 7, and I use the default reminders app.  One of my reminders is different than the others in a good way.  It shows a due date as well as an alert time; and the task includes the name of someone in my contacts and it offers to call them when I click the reminder.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ldme7.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kAdwV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  For the life of me, I can't recreate this.  Anyone know how I did it?  <answer141449> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O0OlC.png" alt="enter image description here"  When receiving a call you can either strongDecline/strong it, strongAccept/strong it, strongRespond with a text message instead of answering/strong (by pressing the emMessage/em button) or strongRemind yourself to return the call/strong (by pressing the emRemind Me/em button).  When tapping the emRemind Me/em button, two options are displayed: emRemind me later/em or emRemind me whenever I leave this place/em.   The reminder you're referring to in your question, is one of the emRemind me later/em kind.
