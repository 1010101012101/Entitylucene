Can't set IPv6 mode on Airport Extreme <body> I have a AirPort Extreme 802.11n (5th Generation) connected to a Zyxel VMG1312-B30A modem. My ISP is Deutsche Telekom with VDSL.  For quite some time I was able to use native IPv6. But this stopped working for me and I don't know why. I am unable to set IPv6 mode on the Airport to Automatic or even Manually! I tried both Airport Utility on the Mac and iOS.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rtnql.png" alt="enter image description here"  I'm getting a IPv6 Relay Error. Strange thing, with other hardware it works just fine.  Did this change with a firmware update? What can I do to get this working again?   <answer217127> If it was working before without a tunnel, the issue is almost certainly the ISP. The AirPort extreme has fairly well-developed IPv6 support, and should work fine.  <answer218212> Did you change your contract? You get IPv6 only in newer "IP-Telefonie" contracts. Maybe you should call the hotline and ask, if it's unlocked.  <comment262455> What version of firmware are you running? What happens when you try to switch on IPv6? <comment263796> nope, didn't change anything. I have someone else with the same setup, who has the same problem. <comment264004> I do not have a VDSL modem, so I can not test it on my line. I running a Fritz!Box, wich runs IPv6 without a problem. <comment264073> I tested it, it works fine with a Speedport and Fritz!box. It worked with my Airport Extreme setup, but not any more.
