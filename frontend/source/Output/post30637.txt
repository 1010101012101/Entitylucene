Saving a Safari page as a PNG image <body> Is there some way in Safari, possibly via a third-party extension, to save the running contents of a Web page as a PNG image?  I understand I could print the page to PDF and use Preview to export it as a PNG image. However:  ol liI’d prefer not to create a temporary PDF file and then manually open Preview to export the PDF contents to PNG;/li liI’d like the contents to be running instead of paginated, i.e., no page breaks;/li liWhen the PDF file contains multiple pages, Preview seems to export the current page only to PNG./li /ol  I don’t have any experience with OS X automation but I suspect it could be used for this, though I want conditions 2 and 3 to be met.  I’m running Safari 5.1.1 on OS X Lion.  <answer30642> webkit2png should be pretty close to Safari. It also works with webarchive files saved from Safari.  precode$ webkit2png -F http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30637 -o nameprefix Fetching http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/30637 ...  ... done $ webkit2png ~/Downloads/test.webarchive Fetching ~/Downloads/test.webarchive ...  ... done $ ls 0testwebarchive-clipped.png 0testwebarchive-thumb.png 0testwebarchive-full.png    nameprefix-full.png /code/pre  Awesome Screenshot is an extension for that should support full page screenshots. I couldn't get them to work with all pages though.  <answer30664> I am using LittleSnapper, which has a feature to "Snap Web Address from Safari":     The LittleSnapper menu item and browser bookmarklet both allow you to snap webpages as you visit them - no interruption required. Alongside these tools, there's even a Safari Extension that allows you to add a Snap button to the Safari toolbar. LittleSnapper also saves the HTML behind each page for future reference.   <answer30710> File print, save as pdf  Open pdf in Preview  File save as PNG  <answer30718> Try Paparazzi! It can save the entire website to a single png file and it lets you specify the size. Once installed, you can also launch it from within Safari by adding 'paparazzi:' to the URL. For example paparazzi:http://www.nytimes.com  <comment35160> Interesting. I’d rather have a solution that could be triggered via Safari, though. <comment35168> Promising but capturing the whole page (as opposed to the current viewport) doesn’t work well. :-/ <comment35288> Quote from the OP: `I’d prefer not to create a temporary PDF file and then manually open Preview to export the PDF contents to PNG;` <comment35315> Additionally, this sets the media type to **print** instead of **screen**, which means if the site has media type specific CSS markup you will get something that looks entirely different from what the browser shows. <comment35316> This is probably the best solution for the problem. Very Mac-like UI, easy way of invoking it and lets you save the entire page length in one image (with custom width). Also, it's free (with donations welcome). <comment266755> What if the Web page requires you to log in to view the content? I tried paparazzi in this situation and it shows me the login page. Can you pass credentials to paparazzi? <comment322866> AwesomeScreenshot is widely considered to be malware. <comment346758> Little snapper is gone, the page has gone 404. <comment346877> @jorisw, LittleSnapper is no longer exists.  Its replacement, Ember, is no longer exists too.
