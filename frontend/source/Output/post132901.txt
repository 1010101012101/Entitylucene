Is there a way to extract contents from AppleScript file without using AppleScript editor? <body> I have a bunch of applescript files I need to run but some that were running yesterday are not running today. Applescript is showing me this beautiful message.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPqeO.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongWhen this message is shown, console shows this message: 04/06/14 11:32:44,079 xpcd[324]: Info.plist does not contain an XPCService dictionary: /System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/XPCServices/SecurityAgent.xpc/strong  The problem is probably with applescript editor, because I have restored several copies of the script with different dates and none opens. Some other scripts open, but not this.  Is there a way t extract the contents of this file to a TXT so I can try to recreate the script?  thanks  NOTE: I have verified now that the scripts are not corrupted by running them from command line using osascript.  <answer147438> You strongcannot/strong open a code.scpt/code file with any editor! It is a compiled version of the script, not text, and it will not open with strongany/strong editor.  Case in point, here is what happens when I try to view the file in Terminal...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iKHYM.jpg" alt="Viewing compiled applescript"  OSX comes with codeosadecompile/code that will extract the source code of a compiled script code.scpt/code file.  Here is an example...  precode$ osadecompile args2.scpt  on run argv     set argc to 0     try         set argc to (count of argv)     end try     display dialog ("Argument Count: " &amp; argc as string) end run /code/pre  <comment157449> If you have Xcode you can try opening it with that? <comment235976> That's a good tool to know about. However, this will not work with run-only compiled apps. Also, if apps aren't saved as run-only they will open right into the editor anyway. <comment299830> Textmate can open binary SCPT files â€” it uses `osadecompile` transparently.
