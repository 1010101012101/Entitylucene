Photo App won't open after I downloaded OS X El Capitan V.10.11 <body> Photo App won't open after I downloaded OS X El Capitan V.10.11.  Response: "Photos must quit because the photo library has become unavailable or its data is corrupt."  <answer209972> To bypass this, hold down the Option key as you open the Photos app. You will get a dialog box letting you choose other (i)Photo libraries, or open a new, blank library:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2r9oA.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment253386> I only have the System Photo Library; so when I click on "Choose Library" I get the same response "Photos must quit..." <comment253402> If you have a backup of this Library (Time Machine or other source) restore it to a location other than` /Users/user_name/Pictures` and use the Option key method to open it up. You should also open Photos app with the Option and Command keys down to attempt to repair the Library. <comment253436> Thank you - thank you!Option/Command keys  and my Photo Library is repaired - I hate to admit, but I would have lost 1/2 y. worth of photos. <comment255823> Thank you. Opening Photo with command + option pressed works.ht library rebuilds and you are good to go.
