Dual boot Linux Mint 17.1 with OS X Lion <body> I have a 13' MacBook (2007, hw.model: 2,1) running OS X Lion (10.7). I wish to dual-boot Linux Mint 17.1 alongside OS X.  I created a Partition for Linux, and have also installed rEFIt (0.14). I have created a LiveUSB as well as the Live DVD for installing Linux Mint.  When I use the LiveUSB and select Linux option in rEFIt, I get the following error:  precodeStarting legacy loader Using load option 'USB' Error: Not Found returned from legacy loader Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Not Found returned from LocateDevicePath Error: Load Error while (re)opening our installation volume  The firmware refused to boot from the selected volume. Note that external hard drives are not well-supported by Apple's firmware for legacy OS booting.  * Hit any key to continue * /code/pre  And when I use the LiveDVD (with and without holding down 'c'), the disk just gets ejected. I burnt 2 new DVDs, and also tested installing it on another machine, where it installed successfully.  Any suggestions on how to resolve this are welcome.  <answer213225> I have the same hardware and experienced the same problem. Booting from DVD and USB didn't work so I created a new partition on the hard drive, copied the Linux iso onto it and booted off that.  Got it installed ok but the fans were running all the time so I gave up on it in the end.   <comment234803> Support for rEFIt has been dropped. You may have better luck with [rEFInd](http://rodsbooks.com/refind/)
