How to auto-import AVCHD video? <body> I need a way to just auto-copy AVCHD from my memory card to the Mac.  The Image Capture and AutoImporter apps both work great for still photos and for MP4 video. Image Capture completely ignores AVCHD, while AutoImporter seems to hang when I plug in the memory card with some AVCHD clips:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4plPg.png" alt="enter image description here"   When manually browsing the memory card, there is on its root level a package called "PRIVATE":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/leT8T.png" alt="enter image description here"  And only 3 levels down can I find the actual MTS files that should be copied... :  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TN4u8.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I get these videos to be auto-copied when I plug in the memory card?
