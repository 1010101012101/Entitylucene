Is there a way to rename my subscriptions in Reeder? <body> Using version 1.2. I can't seem to find a way to do anything other than add subscriptions, folders and delete subscriptions. Is there any way I can just rename my existing subscriptions?  <answer86843> It isn't possible to strongedit/strong subscriptions on Reeder. You will need to login to your RSS, or news feed account to edit subscriptions.   Please go ahead and contact their support to request the ability to do that.   <answer86844> It is not possible to manage the feeds inside Reeder.app. Nevertheless it will synchronize all changes made to feeds strongwithin Google Reader/strong. So if you want to rename a feed, open the emwebpage of Google Reader/em and go to the empreferences/em.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZLkX.jpg" alt="Choose Google Reader Preferences"  In the prefs, choose the emAbonnements tab/em (at least this is the German headline) and rename the feed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4TqJo.jpg" alt="Renaming"  If you now head back to the Reeder.app and synchronize your feeds the changes will be reflected and the feed will be renamed.  emPlease remember that this workaround will only work stronguntil July 1/strong, because Google is shutting down the Reader service./em  <comment100542> Thanks, Cyphorius, that's actually why I was asking. Since Google is shutting down Reader, I was wondering how I would do this in the future. I hope the Reeder people decide to include this option in a future release.
