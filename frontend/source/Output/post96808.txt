What is the default speaking rate for the speech synthesis program? <body> I've been looking all over the internet, but I can't seem to find out the default speaking rate for the in-built speech synthesis program on Mac OS.  codesay "What to say" -r &lt;rate&gt;/code  As shown above there is a way to specify the speaking rate (wpm) but there is no where that specifies the default rate?  Anyone have an idea of what it is?  <answer96809> Not a "nice" way of doing it, but you can do some samples, maybe starting at 120 wpm, and compare them with a control recording of the "default" speed (obviously, with all recordings using the same voice and text). For more precision, you could load the files into any basic audio editing application and view the waveforms to really compare the rate of one recording and another. I can't imagine it would take too long to narrow it down. I'd do it myself if I had the time right now.  Alternatively, you could get some text samples of known lengths (say 100 words, 200 words, etc.), record the voice speaking all of them at default settings, then use the durations to calculate the average wmp of all the recordings. With enough samples I'm sure you'll get close.  emEDIT: Following the first procedure I described above, I have found the default speaking rate of Alex (the default voice) to be exactly strong175 wpm/strong./em  emAt default and 175 wpm speeds, the two waveforms match perfectly./em  <answer96817> The default speaking rates can actually be changed from System Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOHNQ.png" alt=""  The slider can be set to a different position for different voices. When I tried dragging the sliders for Alex and Mikko to the middle, the WPMs shown in the output below were 175 and 180.  precode$ defaults read com.apple.speech.voice.prefs VoiceRateDataArray (         (         1835364215,         201,         175     ),         (         1919902066,         546,         180     ) ) /code/pre  The outputs of codesay -r 175/code and codesay/code without an code-r/code option were identical for Agnes, Alex, and Bruce, and almost identical for some other voices. But for example the default speaking rate of the "Bahh" voice is much slower.  precode$ say -v ? | sed 's/  .*//' | while read l; do say -v "$l" -r 175 {1..9} -o "$l 1.aif"; say -v "$l" {1..9} -o "$l 2.aif"; done $ stat -f '%z %N' * 120136 Agnes 1.aif 120136 Agnes 2.aif 131692 Albert 1.aif 180260 Albert 2.aif 122968 Alex 1.aif 122968 Alex 2.aif 231596 Bad News 1.aif 231820 Bad News 2.aif 131692 Bahh 1.aif 180264 Bahh 2.aif 318508 Bells 1.aif 318488 Bells 2.aif 131692 Boing 1.aif 164368 Boing 2.aif 116514 Bruce 1.aif 116514 Bruce 2.aif 131692 Bubbles 1.aif 138860 Bubbles 2.aif 196652 Cellos 1.aif 197088 Cellos 2.aif 131692 Deranged 1.aif 150720 Deranged 2.aif 131692 Fred 1.aif 138860 Fred 2.aif 331052 Good News 1.aif 331492 Good News 2.aif 301932 Hysterical 1.aif 301916 Hysterical 2.aif 131692 Junior 1.aif 144676 Junior 2.aif 131692 Kathy 1.aif 144676 Kathy 2.aif 118196 Kyoko 1.aif 114440 Kyoko 2.aif 420970 Mikko 1.aif 408432 Mikko 2.aif 228012 Pipe Organ 1.aif 228448 Pipe Organ 2.aif 131692 Princess 1.aif 144676 Princess 2.aif 131692 Ralph 1.aif 144676 Ralph 2.aif 128810 Sin-Ji 1.aif 124834 Sin-Ji 2.aif 131692 Trinoids 1.aif 138860 Trinoids 2.aif 119410 Vicki 1.aif 116118 Vicki 2.aif 122742 Victoria 1.aif 119444 Victoria 2.aif 131692 Whisper 1.aif 150724 Whisper 2.aif 131692 Zarvox 1.aif 138860 Zarvox 2.aif /code/pre  <answer204691> 720 seems max for the voice I am using
