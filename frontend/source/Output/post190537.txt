Why I can't upgrade my Mac Pro OS X 10.7 to a more recent version? <body> Why I can't upgrade my Mac Pro OS X 10.7 to a more recent version?  My system specs are:  MacPro1,1 , Processor 2 x 3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon, Ram 6 GB 667 GHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMM, Graphic Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT 512 MB, Serial Number C074200V08S    System Software: OS X Lion 10.7 (11A511)  <answer190540> As indicated here, the last officially supported system software is Mac OS X 10.7.5.  Any later system (10.8-10.10) is not running on your Mac and you won't be able to upgrade.  Here (english) or here (german) you'll find a hack/workaround to get Yosemite running on your MacPro1,1, if it doesn't contain a 7300GT or X1900XT video card (which is true in your case because your Mac contains a GeForce 8800 GT).
