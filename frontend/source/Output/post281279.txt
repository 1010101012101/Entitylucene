Tell AppleScript to confirm dialog box <body> I wrote a nice script that, among other things, opens a terminal and does stuff (that cannot be done using a shell script). When it finishes I no longer need the terminal andI want to close it. However, using codetell application "Terminal" to quit/code pops up this confirmation window:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e2LkW.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I tell apple script to confirm the dialog box?  For completeness, the structure of my code is  precodeon run {input, parameters}     tell application "Terminal"         do script " "         activate         .....do all kind of things......         quit     end tell end run /code/pre  <comment353906> As I'm one that always has a few Terminal windows open I wouldn't necessarily want to tell Terminal to quit. I'd tell it to close just that window after programmatically terminating any processes started as necessary before telling it to close the window, or quit if you want. Then you do not get that dialog box that has halted your script and thus having to manually respond to. <comment353909> @user3439894 Actually I get around that because I use `iTerm` for my stuff so it's improbable that there's something important going on in `Terminal` that I don't want to kill. But still, could you please give me a hint as to how to get the details of the window and then close is programmatically? <comment353921> Since you used `activate` the active window doing your stuff is frontmost and you'd use `close window 1` in place of `quit`, that is if you just want to close that window and leave Terminal open. That said, however, you have to ensure any processes you've started in that window are terminated that don't or didn't terminate naturally in the process before closing the window or quitting Terminal. Without seeing the actual code I can't tell you specifics however I probably use something like `kill $(pgrep process)`, e.g. `kill $(pgrep vpn)` along with other code as needed.
