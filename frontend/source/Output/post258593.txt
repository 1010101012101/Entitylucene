The issue resolved when I copied the complete pack into the "Applications" folder and ran Eclipse in the path code/Applications/eclipse/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/code from Terminal.  <comment323308> This is an error message! The detailed information is hidden behind the Report... button! What do you expect us to do?

Here is system report: http://pastebin.com/fMsg5XPg <comment349765> If someone could edit a specific version of Luna and a specific version of 10.12 into the s might get better answers, especially if it a bug that gets fixed in time.
