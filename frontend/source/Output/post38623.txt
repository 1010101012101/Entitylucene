What prevents iOS and iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch from having an official screen recorder? <body> I have searched all over Apple's help and documentation I can't find any built in or app store apps that provide screen recording.   What prevents such an app to exist ? Are there any obvious technical reasons?  <answer38625> Apple limits the degree to which iOS applications can communicate and "share". I'm not a developer, but I would be surprised if a screen recorder application is allowed under the rules or possible with the iOS APIs.   If this feature is important to you, send feedback to Apple explaining what you want and why it's important to you.   <answer38626> The technical reason no store app has screen recording is simply that no official API is provided from Apple to developers to perform screen recording.   The hardware is clearly capable of snapping still frames and storing / processing a video feed of the screen's size, so it's probably not a purely technical reason why it's currently not a feature of the OS.  <comment43755> Actually, there is an API. That is how apps enabled video recording on older iPhones. The only problem is it isn't useful for screen recording because you can only record the app it is in. <comment43759> iPhone 4S Screen Mirroring via AirPlay + 3rd Party AirPlay Server = Screen Recording! <comment43776> Should I edit this to say "there is no public API for one app to record whatever is on the screen in that app or in general when switching to another app". The AirPlay screen mirroring API seems to be the way for this to happen going forward.
