MacBook Pro won't boot to OS X after Internet Recovery <body> Someone gave me a MacBook Pro 13″ A1278 2010 model. They took the hard drive and the screen was totally trashed.   I managed to order a new screen from China this other day, however I connect it to a desktop monitor using the mini DP to DVI converter.  Followed a guide that told me to use the CMD + R for recovery and it started downloading something recovery from the Internet, followed the guide, partitioning the drive and voilà all set I thought.   As I chose the startup disk and reboot, however at the reboot it kept showing me the "Mac OS X Utility" page over and over again.   Using another option were to keep the shift key inserted while booting it up I was able to setup account and finish the installation.  So I rebooted again and there was the utility page again.  What might cause the behavior?  I don't have the AirPort connected, it's online through ethernet.  Are there are any logs I can check?  Here is what dmesg says if it can help in any way?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rwa0a.jpg" alt=""  <comment236278> Sorry, that log is impossible to read (bad quality). Try booting in Verbose mode to see where it gets stuck. <comment236317> Actually this is the first time i ever touch a mac, I can get in the system by holding in shift key while booting, but it says safemode. is there a way i can pastebin the log? i can see one error message there saying: "SMC::smcInitHelper ERROR: MMIO regMap == NULL - fall back to old SMC mode"
