How do eject a SD card that is being used by Firefox? <body> I have had several occurrences where I dragged photos from my mounted SD card to upload to my codegoogle plus/code account but then after the photos were successfully update, my SD card was unable to be ejected when I tried.   It complained that the SD card could not be ejected because it was being used by a "Firefox" instance. When I opened up a terminal and did a codelsof/code on my external SD card it showed something like this:  precode➜  ~  lsof /Volumes/NO\ NAME COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME firefox 43658 lowks   77r   REG    1,7  2660487 3802 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00293.JPG firefox 43658 lowks   78r   REG    1,7  2746774 3884 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00294.JPG firefox 43658 lowks   81r   REG    1,7  2552369 3968 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00295.JPG /code/pre  When I went in and deleted the code.Trashes/code folder, and did another codelsof/code, it showed this:  precode➜  NO NAME  lsof /Volumes/NO\ NAME COMMAND   PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME firefox 43658 lowks   77r   REG    1,7  2660487 3802 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00293.JPG firefox 43658 lowks   78r   REG    1,7  2746774 3884 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00294.JPG firefox 43658 lowks   81r   REG    1,7  2552369 3968 /Volumes/NO NAME/.Trashes/501/DSC00295.JPG zsh     45093 lowks  cwd    DIR    1,7    32768    2 /Volumes/NO NAME lsof    45140 lowks  cwd    DIR    1,7    32768    2 /Volumes/NO NAME lsof    45141 lowks  cwd    DIR    1,7    32768    2 /Volumes/NO NAME /code/pre  Has anyone faced a similar situation ? What exactly is going on here ?  <comment211631> Empty the Trash. Try again. <comment211634> Did that it complained that a few items could not be permanently deleted because they were being used. <comment211638> Then try quit the apps that are using them. I'd be inclined in future to copy to a local location first, then move across to any 'off-site' folder. Looks like Firefox isn't properly letting go. <comment211640> Hmm, yeah that is what I had to do, I am going to post a bug report to them. <comment211642> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1148765 <comment211676> It looks like a bug in Firefox.
