R programming language breaks and must be reinstalled <body> Yesterday, I tried to open the R programming environment by typing "R" at the command line.  I was met with the following error message:  precodeFatal error: unable to open the base package /code/pre  I didn't know what to do about that, so I re-installed R.  That fixed the problem, so I went on with my day.  Today, I am met with the same error when I type "R" at the command line.  I am bamboozled!  <comment312246> What happened since yesterday and today? Did you install it correctly? <comment312252> Just used the Mac installer from http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/ <comment312451> Is it your computer? Is it possible something is occurring overnight that resets user-installed software? <comment331923> What OS are you using? <comment332823> Currently on OS X Sierra, haven't had this problem in a while.  Not sure which version I was on in September.
