How to disconnect from wifi on Mac OS X <body> How does one disconnect from a wifi hotspot on Mac OS X?  The only way I found how is to emTurn Wi-Fi off/em then back on and finally select a different access point...  Surely there must be a better way.  <answer156900> Hold down the option key when you click on the WiFi menu. Then next to the currently active network there will be a "Disconnect from" option. I'm on Yosemite, and so I'm not sure whether this was present on earlier versions of OS X.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jSZao.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment184538> I'm on Yosemite too so will not comment on that part. Thanks for your answer. <comment184552> The disconnect option is not available in Lion. <comment214180> FYI, the Disconnect option is not available on Mavericks either. This has to be the most stupid design I've ever seen. Ended up disabling `Remember networks this computer has joined` in the Wifi options. <comment281065> Mine immediately reconnects after selecting 'disconnect'. <comment298643> Directly hit on the bull's eye... Thanks for the answer
