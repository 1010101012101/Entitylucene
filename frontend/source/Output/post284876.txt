Launchpad errors - Xcode and GarageBand are shown twice <body> I have some problems in my Launchpad on MacOS Sierra.br The first problem is that I have Xcode icon twice on the Launchpad, and both of the icons are opening the Xcode program.  The second problem is with GarageBand. On my Launchpad, I have the GarageBand icon which opens the program, but I also have this icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dVXzr.png" alt="enter image description here"  This icon also open GarageBand from the Launchpad.  I don't see any duplicated icons of Xcode in the codeApplications/code folder, and I don't see in there this file.  What can I do to fix this, but without taking risks as losing files?  <comment359318> Try [rebuilding the Spotlight index](http://osxdaily.com/2012/01/17/rebuild-spotlight-index/). <comment359490> @IconDaemon I'm not sure it will fix this. Also, I prefer a short solution, and not a solution that can take hours... <comment359641> Sorry! I meant LaunchServices, not Spotlight. When you right-click on an Xcode or GarageBand document and select Open With do you see multiple instances of these apps in the list? If so, this is one symptom of a funky Launch Services database. Rebuilding the database is simple. Look [at this site for more information](https://mac-how-to.gadgethacks.com/how-to/remove-duplicates-customize-open-with-menu-mac-os-x-0157100/). Fixed it. Apologies @Ido Naveh!
