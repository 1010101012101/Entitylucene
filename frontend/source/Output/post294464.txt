Messages on MacBook isn't sending or receiving messages, despite being signed in to iCloud <body> My iPhone is connected to iCloud with the same account. In Messages → Preferences, under "You can be reached for Messages at:" my iPhone's number and my iCloud account are both there and checked.  I have tried restarting Messages, my MacBook, as well as turning iMessage off and on from my phone, and removing the files from code~/Library/Messages/code. Nothing so far has worked.  My computer is running El Capitan, and other applications (such as Notes) can sync over iCloud just fine.  <answer294707> The first step would be to make sure you can send iMessages to other iCloud users. If not, then you’ll want to codeSign Out/code of iCloud under strongMessages/strong → strongPreferences/strong → strongAccounts/strong. You may need to reboot your MacBook before signing back in.  If it’s regular text messages (SMS/MMS) that aren’t working, on your iPhone open strongSettings/strong → strongMessages/strong → strongText Message Forwarding/strong and make sure your MacBook is emenabled/em. If it already is, toggle it off, then back on. You will be prompted to enter a verification code sent to your MacBook.  If none of this works, you may need to reboot both devices with everything disabled, then reactivate everything only after booting back up.  <comment371709> Are you trying to send iMessages (to other iCloud users), or plain SMS/MMS messages? <comment371970> Idealing SMS/MMS messages, but I'm pretty sure it would automatically send iMessages to other users with Apple devices. <comment372238> That was it: text Message Forwarding was not turned on! I would have thought that it was automatic, considering the last time I had an iPhone it connected everything right off the bat. Thanks very much.
