How to search for iTerm windows based on their title? <body> Is there an easy way to search for iTerm windows based on their title?  At any given time I have around 10+ iTerm windows open, each of which contains around 3+ tabs. I try to manage each window by project, so for example, window A would contain a bash tab for project A, a vim screen for project A, and a language specific console for project A. And so forth.  This becomes cumbersome when I have to jump from one project to another. I have to sift through each window and figure out if that's the project I'm looking for.  Is there an easy way to just search for tabs according to its title so I don't have to flip through these windows every time? I'm thinking something like Alfred or Spotlight (but I don't think either of them supports this kind of feature...)
