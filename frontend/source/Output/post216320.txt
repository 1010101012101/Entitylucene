sleepimage manipulation <body> How can I cause Mavericks to generate the sleepimage without actually putting the computer to sleep?  How can I manually cause Mavericks to replace current contents of the memory with the sleepimage?  Same question rephrased at higher level of abstraction: how can I save arbitrary context -- open apps, windows, daemons, etc; and how can I restore an arbitrary context into memory? If you know of any other ways to implement this, such as window management app, I'd love to hear about it.  <comment261351> What are you ultimately trying to do by saving the sleepimage? Be able to force the machine into a known/fresh state? <comment261352> For example.  There are different things I do on a mac: write code, manage personal documents, edit photos.  Each of this requires a set of open windows positioned at specific location on the screen as well as certain background processes.  I call this "the context" in the original question.  Ultimately, I want to easily swap between context.  One moment I have Eclipse and Terminal on my screen, next moment I have Photoshop and iPhoto, next back to dev tools exactly where I left off.  Does this answer your question? <comment261355> Yes, understood...I'd be surprised if there's a way to do this on the fly. I think what might work is just to make multiple user accounts and toggle between them. <comment261377> Have you considered just using Spaces? Your requirements would appear to be very similar to my own, & that's been my solution ever since Spaces was introduced. Specific apps launch to specific spaces, swap with ctrl/num See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179376/what-is-an-efficient-way-for-developers-power-users-to-use-osx-window-manageme/179403#179403 <comment261420> @Tetsujin, "spaces"  (I think, they are called "desktops" these days) do not solve my problem.  There are many reasons why.  The main one is that it requires applications and services for multiple contexts to exist in memory at the same time.  That causes the computer to be brown out.  Thanks for suggestion.
