No startup / boot chime; how to bring it back? <body> I'm one of the lucky (?) guys who managed to get a new MacBook Pro 2016 (the version that introduced the Touch Bar).  This MBP model does not have a boot chime by default.    There are documented ways to enable it, specifically going to Terminal.app and typing in:  codesudo nvram BootAudio=%01/code  Unfortunately for me, this fix does not work on my own machine. Other people have noticed this as well.  My guess is that it's a firmware fix or enhancement that got rid of codeBootAudio/code as an option.  Does anyone know a different option to re-enable the startup chime?  <answer276455> Unfortunately there is no way to bring the startup chime back (although I'm happy to be corrected).  As for the codeBootAudio/code command, strongit never actually worked/strong! sup1, 2/sup  However, the codeAutoBoot/code option is still available. In case you don't know, the codeAutoBoot/code command can enable/disable the MBP from booting when the lid is opened. You can use the codeAutoBoot/code command as follows:  ul liDisable auto boot: codesudo nvram AutoBoot=%00/code/li liEnable auto boot: codesudo nvram AutoBoot=%01/code/li /ul  Personally I would leave Auto Boot on, but that's a personal preference.  sup1/sup - I've emnever/em seen it work on a single 2016 MBP since they first became available, and I've had my hands on many!  sup2/sup - See 2016 MacBook Pro: Enabling the Startup Chime... does not work. Note this was published on 18 November 2016, and remember the 2016 MBPs were launched at an Apple Event on 27 October 2016. So we have users confirming the codeBootAudio/code command isn't working within 3 weeks of the official launch. Keep in mind the MBPs did not ship for a while after the event as well. So, when did it emever/em work?
