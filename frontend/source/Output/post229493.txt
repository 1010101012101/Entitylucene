iOS 9 Screen Recording in El Capitan <body> I used to record iOS devices through QuickTime, however now it's only recording audio (not sure is this linked to OS X 10.11 or iOS 9).  How can I fix this (without third party sofrware)?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YUmFk.png" alt="screenshot"  <answer229512> You have to choose strongNew Movie Recording/strong (kbd⌥ ALT/kbd+kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbdN/kbd) instead of strongNew Screen Recording/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0uxV.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229519> Here's how I would go about solving this:  ol liMake sure you are running the latest versions of iOS 9 and OS X 10.11 (if not, update)/li liForce quit QuickTime Player and reopen it/li liRestart your Mac/li liRestart your iOS device/li liMake sure that you are using an Apple-branded cable/li liBoot into recovery and reinstall OS X/li liBackup your iPhone with iTunes, erase it, and restore the backup/li liClone your Mac's HD or SSD with Disk Utility onto an external HD or SSD, wipe the internal drive, reinstall OS X, and use Migration Assistant to restore the cloned external drive/li liReport the bugs to Apple, wait for the next updates, and hope that they fix it/li /ol  <comment279985> Can you post a few screenshots? <comment279986> I added one but was removed for some reason, anyway just added again. (PS I tried with different iPhones and computer so I assume this is an expected behavior) <comment280001> I answered it that way, but the OP said that option doesn't exist, so I deleted my answer and started again. <comment280003> @RedEagle2000 I haven't seen this. OP screenshot shows clearly Screen Recording not Movie Recording... <comment280142> Thank, I will try step 7 but I actually tried with different devices and computer, but will try anyway
