What are some tactile iPad apps to show to a graphic designer? <body> I'm looking for apps that have faux materials in them like leather, wood, paper, etc. (Apple stresses "tactile" apps when guiding developers.) I'm trying to guide a graphic designer. What are some apps that I can show that get the point across?   <answer20149> Your question didn't specify free apps so here are a few paid apps:  ul liManage - currently $2.99 in AUD. Has a faux leather look./li liCorkulous - currently $4.99 in AUD. Simulates a corkboard complete with sticky-taped labels and sticky notes./li liRuler 2 - currently $0.99 in AUD. Looks like a wooden ruler./li liABC News - this one is free. It's not tactile, but the lead stories are presented wrapped around a globe./li /ul  There is a free app called Stylapps that is a showcase for stylish apps, though not specifically for apps that look like tactile materials.
