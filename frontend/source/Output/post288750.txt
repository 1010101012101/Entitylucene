Understanding Qualcomm baseband log <body> So I have this issue where my iPhone picks up any incoming call automatically after about 1 second of ringing (96991-96994 in the log) (wrote about it on here), and in an attempt to debug it I am sifting through CoreTelephony. Anyone with experience of reading baseband logs is deeply appreciated to point out any anomalies in the dump.   I've highlighted some significant events and cut repetitions for readability, and haven't noticed anything that might be causing this behavior so far. Supposedly the issue should pop up somewhere in the earlier mentioned period between DisplayOn and CallStatus=Conversation.    Missing something or the issue is not here?  Dropbox link to log  upd1: I also got this line in the syslog.br code{WARNING:  21:53:22.130 [tid 0x371b000] VirtualAudio_PlugIn.cpp[134]: SetVoiceProcessingState(): Attempt to enable routing in support of voice processing while in or requesting an invalid route/mode pair ([ Category: 'csav'; Mode: 'imdf'}/code  upd2: looking through qmdl logs in QCAT I am also not seeing anything abnormal, either because I'm not looking where I need to, or because the issue is not in the modem.  upd3: here is the processed in QCAT log, which was dumped due to baseband crash - when an active call is in progress, another incoming call is canceled with this bug.  <comment365185> Can probably be migrated to networkengineering
