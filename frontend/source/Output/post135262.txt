Connecting iPhoto to external drive <body> Would it be possible to create iPhoto "repository" on an external USB hard drive, so that every time I would plug the drive I launch iPhoto, I could manage my photos?  <answer135269> If you mean an iPhoto library for storing masters/etc, you can create a second library by strongholding ‚å• when launching iPhoto/strong. You can create a new library and will be prompted for a location to store it.  If the library is unavailable when launching iPhoto, the original library will be used again (or one created if the original library can't be found).
