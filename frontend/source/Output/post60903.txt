Safari: stop hiding tabs <body> I can't use safari and continue using chrome only because of 1 reason: chrome doesn't hides tabs (when there are too many of them) I just want to act safari like this img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cBIdA.png" alt="Good tabs"  And not like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5vXik.png" alt="Bad tabs"  Is there some plugin or workaround to make safari better ?  <answer61094> Glims for Safari is your friend.  After installation go to Safari  Preferences  Glims  Tabs Misc.  and check "Set minimum tab labels size to favicon size".  You'll get something like thisâ€¦  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5V59u.png" alt="Lots of tabs"
