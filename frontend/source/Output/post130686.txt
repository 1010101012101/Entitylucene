How do I recalculate in Excel for Mac? <body> This is driving me a little bit crazy. In my old PC days I used to press either kbdF5/kbd or kbdF9/kbd (I can't remember) to have Excel coderecalculate/code.  What is the Mac equivalent?  PS: Perhaps this is not the place to ask. If so, please redirect me. :)  <answer130688> AFAIK it's kbdF9/kbd on Windows .  So did you try the keystrokes kbdFn/kbd+kbdF9/kbd ?   <answer184611> To recalc in Mac:  strongCommand/strong + strong=/strong  You can try also changing Excel preferences: Command  , Calculation "Manually" radio button  <comment153298> Unbelievable. I never saw that my Mac has F-keys too. _Feeling dumb._ Thanks! <comment153300> Learning something new everyday feels always great :) <comment329763> For some reason fn + f9 does not work for me. CMD + = does work, however.
