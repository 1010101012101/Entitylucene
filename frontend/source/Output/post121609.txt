How to archive email in separate file <body> I have a pop account, say Yahoo, and I'd like to archive all the email I have on the POP to my Mac. I don't necessarily want to clutter up my main Apple Mail mailbox.  What's the best way to do this? Install an open source mail program?  <comment141753> If I understand you correctly, you do not want to use the apple mail.app! Do you want to save your Yahoo as mail or as plain text files. In first case, yes you need some email program in the second case you do not need an email program. <comment141754> this might be something for you http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44764/is-there-a-command-line-mail-program-for-mac
