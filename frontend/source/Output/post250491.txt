SOME new photos from iPhone not showing up as new in Photos <body> Just returned from a trip to Niagara Falls, took about 180 photos on iPhone but when I hook into my iMac and Photos automatically opens it is only recognizing about 24 as "new" and the others are not showing up at all. I see all of them in iCloud and can download from there, I'm just frustrated it's not working the way it is supposed to (and the way that is easier). Any ideas?  <comment312493> When you say "I see them all in iCloud," can you be more specific about what you mean? If you're using iCloud Photo Library and have that turned on in Photos on your Mac and in settings on your iPhone, then all photos taken on your iPhone should automatically end up in Photos through iCloud Photo Library, though it's possible the 24 photos it sees as new didn't make it into ICL for some reason. If you mean something else, please clarify.
