MacBook Air Wi-Fi is not working -- how can I troubleshoot the problem? <body> I am trying to connect to Wi-Fi. It does get connected but there is no internet. I can't use Wi-Fi. Weird thing is that when I connect my iPad and iPhone to the same router/Wi-Fi they work perfectly fine. But my MacBook Air has some issue. How can I fix this problem?  My OS is 10.9.5.   Update  Wifi is working in safe mode.  <answer261083> Have you tried resetting your computer's System Management Controller (SMC)?  strongFor the MacBook Air, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  Also, another thing worth doing is resetting your NVRAM.   strongTo reset your NVRAM do this:/strong  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. mouse speed, time and date/timezone, etc).  strong[EDIT]/strong  Since we've established it works in Safe Mode, this means we've eliminated both the possibility of a network/router issue or a hardware issue. This is good, because it must be related to some sort of 'software' or 'data' issue. There is a remote possibility it will now work when started up normally, as booting in Safe Mode will have cleared some data.   If it doesn't, as another test, try creating another User Account and testing that. To do this, follow these steps:  ol liGo to System Preferences/li liClick on Users &amp; Groups /li liClick on the + sign at bottom left (you may need to unlock the padlock before you can make changes)/li liIn your Login Options turn off Automatic Login and also ensure you display your login window as a list of users/li liExit System Preferences/li liShutdown your computer/li liReboot your computer and then login by selecting the User you just created /li liTry connecting to WiFi/li /ol  Please report back on the outcome.  <answer261091> It sounds like that your network settings are corrupt.   strongReset your wifi settings/strong Another option could be to reset the network and wifi settings.   a) In Macintosh HD/ Library / Preferences / SystemConfiguration   precodecom.apple.airport.preferences.plist /code/pre     ul liMove those files to the trash/li liReboot your Mac/li liReconnect to your wifi/li /ul  b) Alternatively you can open SystemPreferences  Networks  select Wifi and delete it. In the second step re-add the wifi service again.  strongUpgrade to macOS/strong If possible try updating your Mac to the latest macOS version. Open the AppStore and download Mac Sierra.  strongDisable Third-Party Software/strong Do you use any kind of Firewall Apps e.g. Little Snitch. If so, temporarily disable them.  <comment326896> Open the OS X  network settings  wifi  advanced and hit  Renew DHCP Lease button. Open safari and reload the webpage you are trying to open <comment326897> Just tried it after your comment but still same issue. The thing is that it is keep getting the same ip after pressing renew dhcp lease. <comment326899> Is it any wifi you can't connect or is it a specific network you can't connect? <comment326900> Is this a one time issue, and does it persist after reboot? <comment326901> #fsb I haven't tried with other wifi yet. For that I may go to Starbucks :(. # kisa this the first time it happened. I tried restarting my MacBook several times and also the router. The problem still exist. <comment326903> Which is control button? <comment326904> It may be Ctrl on your keyboard. <comment326906> Tried both but still e same issue :( <comment326908> Have you got an iPhone or other device from which you can share a personal hotspot from? If so it'd be good to do that and see if you can connect to that from the MacBook Air. Basically we need to identify if this is a problem specific to your WiFi network/router setup or not. <comment326912> I just went to Starbucks and I had the same issue there. <comment326916> Okay, good to know.  I would try the first part of the answer from @howdytom . That is, everything but upgrading to Sierra. Another thing to try is booting into Safe Mode and seeing if that makes any difference. Do this by holding the SHIFT key down during startup and trying to connect to WiFi again. <comment326917> I couldn't find these files in that location at all. I will update once I have wifi :) <comment326918> IN safe mode wifi is working <comment326919> It was called differently in OS X Mavericks. Do you see a file called com.apple.airport.preferences.plist? If so. Delete it and reboot your Mac. <comment326920> In safe mode wifi is working. See my update in question. <comment326923> any help after finding out that wifi is fine <comment326924> I didn't find that file either <comment326925> Another option: Connect your MacBook with your router using a Ethernet cable. Than update to OS X 10.12 <comment326926> It is MacBook Air no Ethernet slot <comment326928> This is great. I've updated my answer with another test to try. <comment326930> Yes, there's also a Thunderbold Ethernet adapter available <comment326932> To help you further. What files are available in Macintosh HD/ Library / Preferences / SystemConfiguration? <comment326936> Nope after safe mode I restarted and wifi still didn't work. Created new user and shutdown and turn on still didn't work. <comment326937> There are bunch of files but the one that is related wifi is com.apple.wifi.keychain-format.plist which I already moved to trash <comment326938> any further help in this issue? <comment326940> Go to System Preferences  Network  Advanced... button - Select the problematical SSID in the list of Preferred Networks and click the minus (-) sign to delete it. Reconnect to the SSID with the proper credentials.. <comment326941> @icondaemon how can I know proper credentials of  Ssid and what do you mean by ssid? You mean network name? <comment326942> SSID = network name. If this SSID has a username/password or just a password, those are credentials. Just delete this network name and re-connect to it. <comment326944> I already tried these things before posting this question. <comment326945> Something you've installed or configured is affecting your internet connection. Some sort of 3rd party software, driver, etc is causing the problem. That's why it works fine in Safe Mode, because Safe Mode doesn't load these. Is there anything you've recently changed? Installed any new software? Bought any new hardware (printers etc)? If nothing has changed, then doing a clean install of macOS may be warranted. If so, you may or may not want to upgrade to a newer OS, but there's nothing inherently wrong with staying on OS X 10.9.5 although it's no longer technically supported since September. <comment326991> Open SystemPreferences  Networks  select Wifi and delete it. In the second step read the wifi service again. Moreover do you use any kind of Firewall Apps e.g. Little Snitch. If so, temporarily disable them. <comment326992> @ZafarSaleem - you said you tried these things before, please edit your question to show what you have attempted.
