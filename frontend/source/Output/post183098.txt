Where are the images for the Messages.app status bubbles located on filesystem? <body> I'm assuming Messages.app uses images for their status bubbles like other graphics in the app. Here are the bubbles I'm talking about:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1moG.jpg" alt="status bubbles image"  If my assumption is correct, then where are they located on the filesystem? I'm trying to find the images to use them as a resource for a local app I'm creating. I'm on 10.10.1 if that matters.   <answer183103> Path is: /Applications/Messages.app/Contents/Resources/  ol liOpen up strongApplications/strong/li liRight-click on strongMessages/strong/li liClick strongShow Package Contents/strong/li liDouble-click on strongResources/strong/li /ol  However, rather than taking Apple's graphics, you're better off creating your own. Can't be too tough to create two circles with borders. Preview will do it for you in 5 mins.  <comment218359> Thanks for the reply. However, that is the first place I looked.  I can't seem to find them in that folder. I thought it would be easier to use pre-existing graphics. But, you're right, it is taking a bit longer to find them rather than creating my own. Anyway, I'd still like to know.
