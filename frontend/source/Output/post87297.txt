Time Machine doesn't backup folders with same name as user <body> Let's say my OS X user's folder is called codeAttila/code and I have a folder with the same name in a folder, e.g. code~/Xcode/Attila//code. Now, if I do a Time Machine backup, the code~/Xcode/Attila//code folder won't be copied.  Why is it? Is there a workaround to fix this?  (OS X version: 10.8.3)  hr  h2EDIT/h2  codetmutil removeexclusion/code doesn't seem to work in this case:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x0tAf.png" alt="enter image description here"  hr  h2EDIT 2/h2  Might not be relevant, but my user account was migrated from a Time Machine backup.  <answer87303> I am assuming you have already checked in in strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongTime Machine/strong  strongOptions/strong to ensure those folders have not been excluded?  We can then use the codetmutil/code utility to find out some more information about this.  From strongTerminal/strong enter this command:  precodetmutil isexcluded ~/Xcode/Attila /code/pre  This will tell you whether it has been excluded from Time Machine backup or not. If it lists  precode[Excluded]    /Users/Attila/Xcode/Attila /code/pre  You can then remove it from the exclusions list by running   precodesudo tmutil removeexclusion -p ~/Xcode/Attila /code/pre  For more information on codetmutil/code, check out its documentation  <answer88429> Is FileVault or home folder encryption enabled?  Saw a mention of it at:  https://superuser.com/questions/53961/time-machine-no-longer-backs-up-changes-to-files-in-home-folder  If that is the case, then logging out of that account and into that of another user whose account isn't FileVault'd, you should be able to trigger TimeMachine and see the home account backed up.  <answer88661> I had a file called codeAttila.sparsebundle/code in my home directory. Renaming it to something that's not related to the username solved the issue.  <comment102035> Pre-Mountain Lion will list an excluded item as `-    /Users/Attila/Xcode/Attila ` <comment102059> After `sudo tmutil removeexclusion -p ~/Xcode/Attila` the item is still in the list marked as `[Excluded]`, even when using `/Users/Attila/Xcode/Attila`. (Btw, running 10.8.3) <comment102061> (I've added a screen capture to my question.) <comment102063> Hmm... Well at least that does help us out. We know that time machine is actively ignoring it (rather than a bug). Try without the -p flag. Also, perhaps it's the Xcode folder that is excluded? <comment102065> The Xcode folder is included. (No ignored folders are shown in System Preferences  Time Machine.). removeexclusion doesn't even work without the -p flag. <comment102634> Are there other folders in ~/Xcode which do get backuped? What happens if you rename ~/Xcode/Attila and trigger a new backup? <comment102638> Can you reproduce this in any other folder than ~/Xcode? I just tried with ~/temp/username and got `[Included] /Users/username/temp/username`. <comment102642> @patrix: Renaming doesn't help. I've tried ignoring other folders, and removeexclusion doesn't seem to take any effect on either of them. <comment102643> @lupincho: I'll give it a try when I'll be at home later today! <comment102697> @lupincho: every folder that has the prefix "username" is excluded. <comment103547> FileVault is not enabled. <comment103604> Hmm.. interesting. Going to try to simulate this on my other Mac tonight and see if I can't replicate the error. <comment103608> @AttilaH btw, which version of Mac OS X are you using? <comment103616> Mountain Lion 10.8.3 (It is included in the question...) <comment103684> Have you tried it? <comment103766> No, not yet. Strangely enough, couldn't find a blank disk I could use to test the time machine run on. <comment208736> Having a similar issue, TM is not backing up a path on an external volume named 'data'.   /Volumes/data/* is being backed up _except_ for /Volumes/data/home which isexcluded. Other than being named "home" there is nothing special about this folder or permissions compared to the other paths on the data volume. Removing the exclusion with tmutil does not change the reported state. There are no 'sparsebundle' files anywhere on the volume nor the boot volume. Yet, /Volumes/data/home is not being backedup.  Renaming the folder to e.g. 'homee' causes it to be not isexcluded.  WTF !? Yosemite 10.10.2 <comment208741> Turns out the "standard exclusions" include /home, /dev and /net on _all_ volumes, not only the boot volume. Oops.
