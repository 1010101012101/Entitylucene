How to recover corrupted HFS+ partition in external HD? <body> I've got a 1 TB SeaGate FreeAgent Drive with following partitions:  ol li700 GB ExFAT (labelled as FREEAGENT1)/li li300 GB HFS+ (labelled as FREEAGENT2)/li /ol  While moving data from 1 to 2, it got accidentally unplugged, and now, when I connect it again, FREEAGENT1 is mounted correctly, but FREEAGENT2 doesn't.  strongDisk Utility/strong recognizes it as "Untitled" and completely full. I can't use First Aid or mount it.  strongTestDisk/strong doesn't find that partition; It recognizes the disk (in my case, /dev/disk1s2), but gives the message: "No partition found or selected for recovery".  strongDiskWarrior/strong detects it as "Untitled", and rebuild option is unavailable.  I've tried even to mount it on a strongLinux (Ubuntu 15.10)/strong machine, but it gives an error when trying to mount.  Running the command strongfsck/strong, it says: "Incorrect number of thread records (emsome number/em, emsome number/em)" and "The volume  could not be repaired".  Now, when I plug it, it doesn't even initialize the HD.  Does someone know how I can fix it or, at least, recover the files I lost?  <comment268713> Please attach the Seagate, open Terminal, enter `diskutil list`, `sudo gpt -r show /dev/diskX` and `sudo fdisk /dev/diskX` with diskX= disk identifier of the Seagate found in `diskutil list` and add the outcome to your question. Do you remember how you partitioned the disk (i.e. MBR or GUID partition table)? <comment268968> Thanks @klanomath, your answer seems very useful, but I already erased the drive. I found a backup. :)
