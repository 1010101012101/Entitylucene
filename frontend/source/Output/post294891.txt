Unable to Extend Macintosh HD partition to use Free Space <body> After a failed Linux installation I'm unable to extend my Macintosh HD logical volume to recover unused space. I'm on v10.12.6 of macOS Sierra. Trying to remove the "Free space" partition in Disk Utility results in a message of     The requested size change for the target disk or a related disk is too small. Please try a different disk or partition, or make a larger change.   Since it's a ~20GB change I'm not sure that's the problem. I've tried using the Disk Utility First Aid tool on the physical disk and logical volume.  I'm nervous about using the codediskutil coreStorage resizeVolume/code command since a) it doesn't seem to use the /dev/disk0s2 identifier and b) I've read that it's unsupported (but does show up in codediskutil coreStorage/code on my version of macOS).  Attached are the Disk Utility and codediskutil list/code output for more info.  img src="https://imgur.com/S0vR6jT.png" alt="disk util window" img src="https://imgur.com/g4N3iv6.png" alt="diskutil list"
