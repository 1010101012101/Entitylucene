Yosemite OS: Turning a kext off and on -- consequences? <body> Are there consequences to turning a kext on and off repeatedly?  Also, How can I check to make sure a specific kext is already on or off?  <answer164085> I do not know how you turn kext on and off instead load and unload.  But, if you want to know current loaded kext's use Terminal.  precodekextstat &gt; ~/Desktop/kexts.txt /code/pre  This will output a text file to your Desktop of currently active kext.  <comment309800> or just type `kextstat` and read the output!
