Delete Bootcamp Partition and recover Disk Full Space <body> I have a problem with my Bootcamp partition. I decided to delete it because I don't use Windows anymore. I went through Bootcamp Assistant, tried to uninstall Windows but didn't work that way.  So I formated with Disk Utility my 40 GB Bootcamp Partition and it's now empty.  Now, I struggle in reuniting the 2 partitions and have my full 128 GB space back. -- I tried to follow this tutorial but in vain :  I deleted my Bootcamp partition but can&#39;t resize my OS X partition  I unmounted both volumes and I'm stuck at the 2nd step of the tutorial :  precodegpt add -b &lt;disk0s4 start position&gt; -t windows /dev/disk0 /code/pre  strongIt says " No space available"./strong Does anyone know what's going on here?  hr  The output of codesudo gpt -r show disk0/code:  precode    start       size  index  contents         0          1         PMBR         1          1         Pri GPT header         2         32         Pri GPT table        34          6                 40     409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B    409640  147408336      2  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 147817976    1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 149087512        744          149088256   87627736      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC 236715992     262151          236978143         32         Sec GPT table 236978175          1         Sec GPT header /code/pre  <answer285890> The linked method to create a fake Boot Camp partition doesn't work because the former partition is no empty space but an HFS volume (disk0s4). The codegpt/code command won't add partitions in allocated disk space.  To resize your main partition (disk0s2) to the full ~120 GB, boot to your main macOS volume, delete the second HFS+ volume and expand your main partition:  precodediskutil eraseVolume Free Space disk0s4 /code/pre  Try to expand the main volume:  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 R /code/pre  If the codeR/code size option fails try to use a real size like 120g or the percentage 100% (on some external disks this may fail because of some 2 TiB limit).  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 120473m /code/pre  or more exactly:  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 120473067520b /code/pre  or  precodediskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 100% /code/pre  <comment360643> Hi klano thanks for the answer.  Sorry I'm beginner in this, when should I type your command?  Thanks <comment360651> Ok I add the information on a separate answer <comment360682> DAMN IT WORKED THANKS A LOT !  Actually the full size of the disk is 121.33 GB.  diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 100% didn't work ( MediaKit reports partition (map) too small)   nor diskutil resizeVolume disk0s2 121g  ( MediaKit reports not enough space on device )   But with 120g it worked fine.  Thanks again klanomath, so quick and efficient! <comment360683> @ShqKa Full size means *full available size* here: 121.33 GB - EFI - Recovery HD - 2*40*512 Byte (partition tables + unallocated disk space to align to 4k blocks)
