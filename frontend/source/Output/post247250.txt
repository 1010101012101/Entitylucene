Install BootCamp drivers Windows 10 <body> I am looking for the exe files for BootCamp drivers for Windows 10. I installed Windows 10 on my Mac 4 months ago using the ISO and BootCamp assistant but then I reinstalled it directly on the partition which made the BootCamp drivers go away, and now some things (such as right click and two finger touchpad scrolling) don't work. I want to get the drivers without having to reinstall Windows (at the beginning Mac gives you the BootCamp installation files as an exe but I can't find them anywhere online.)   <answer247252> strongNEW SOLUTION/strong  Open Boot Camp Assistant, and click on "Action" in the menu bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NJjeZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click on Download Windows Support Software.  strongOLD SOLUTION/strong  You can download the drivers from Boot Camp Assistant.  First, uncheck "Create a Windows 7 or later install disk" and "Install Windows 7 or later version", leaving only "Download the latest Windows support software from Apple" option checked. It should look something like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/L9Elz.png" alt="Boot Camp Assistant"  Make sure you have a USB drive connected, and click continue. You should see a screen like this:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YN7tk.png" alt="Boot Camp Storage Screen".   Select your drive and click on continue. It should download it to the connected USB drive.  Reboot into Windows, and install the support software from the USB.  Edit: I found Brigadier, a software that fetches and installs the drivers for you on Windows. I'll take a look at it, when I have more time.  <comment305081> I don't see those options in BootCamp assistant :( http://imgur.com/a/64YAv (it's a large gif so give your browser some time to load it) <comment305085> Also, just tried using Brigadier.exe and it downloaded it but it failed to install because the version of BootCamp it downloaded was designed for Windows 8.1: http://i.imgur.com/jWn0VAx.png <comment305088> @kirill2485 What if you download it from Mac OS X? What is your Macbook model? I'll try downloading it for you. <comment305092> its an early 2015 MacBook Pro Retina 13 inch <comment305094> @kirill2485 Hi, I added a new solution. Can you try the new solution (top of my answer)
