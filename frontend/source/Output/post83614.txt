Where does OS X Lion save data from my iPhone backups? <body> Where does OS X Lion save all the information it copies when making backups of my iPhone 4? Specifically, I'm looking for where my contacts, photos, music are.  I can not find them in the 'Application Support' folder.   <answer83616> Information emabout/em your iPhone is in ~/Library/MobileDevice  The Backup of your iPhone (photos, documents, settings, etc.) is in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup  Neither of the above are in a form which is easily readable.  To be able to see and/or extract data from the backup you can use an application like iBackup Viewer  <answer192636> Don't forget also about the mobile apps from your phone. When you do a phone backup from iTunes it also prompts you to back up all the mobile apps from your phone.   The apps are backed up separately and stored at the following directory: code~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications/code  For Mac OS X 10.6 and earlier the location is: code~/Music/iTunes/Mobile Applications//code  <comment96463> I have looked the same path, but under Applocation Support I an not fined MobileSync/Backup.
