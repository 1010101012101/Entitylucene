Where are the commercials coming from in itunes and how to remove them? <body> I updated iTunes to v.11.0.1, and now when I play my music from my hard drive, randomly in between songs, there are commercials from 1.FM. This is very annoying!  How can I get rid of this?  <answer79822> Re-install the iTunes because it's not a normal thing to be happening   <comment92108> Wow, this is really weird. I have never encountered something like this in iTunes. Do you also listen to radio streams in iTunes?
