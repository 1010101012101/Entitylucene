Can the same credit card be used for multiple Apple ID accounts? <body> Can the same credit card be used for multiple Apple ID accounts (except for the Family plan case of course)?   Any link to official Apple statement would be much appreciated. Thanks   <answer293608> Why strongemwouldn't/em/strong you be able to associate a single credit card with multiple Apple IDs?  I've done it when I used to have a work-issued iPhone along with my personal iPhone (so I could expense work-related apps, if needed).  If you use the Family option, the same card is used for purchases on all connected accounts.   See Change or remove your Apple ID payment information.  <comment370371> Do you have a problem adding the same card to multiple accounts?  I've never heard of anyone having a problem using the same card.  My wife and I have the same card on both our Apple IDs. <comment370495> @fsb yep, iTunes is giving me weird errors saying it cannot process my request, tried several times. Don't have another card to test the assumption. <comment370579> Why wouldn't you be able to set up a European account with US credit card? But you couldn't. <comment370581> @DataGreed regions aren't part of the question <comment370582> @DataGreed :: what "weird errors" are you getting? <comment373186> @warren something like "Operation can not be completed" - I tried it for several days and it does not disappear. I can successfully registered an account with different card, though. That's why I though that maybe iTunes cannot handle the error produced when the card is used more than by one account at once without family sharing <comment373208> @DataGreed - sounds more like there is an issue with the *card*
