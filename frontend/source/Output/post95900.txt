Mac OSX Apple Script, How do I make Apple Script push keys on an application <body> What I am trying to do is make my character run up 50 steps then down 50 steps repeatedly using the up key and the down key. I know how to utilize system events to push keys and I know how to tell applications to do certain things but what I put together so far is not looking right. I am pretty much new to this, and I am trying to learn a bit, please help!!  <answer95901> precodetell application "Your App Name Here"     activate     tell application "System Events"         repeat 50 times             key code 126             -- up         end repeat         repeat 50 times             key code 125             -- down         end repeat     end tell end tell /code/pre  <answer95902> You might also add a delay somewhere in the loop to make it easier to stop the script:  precodeactivate application "TextEdit" delay 0.5 -- time to release modifier keys if the script is run with a keyboard shortcut tell application "System Events"     repeat while name of (process 1 where frontmost is true) is "TextEdit"         repeat 50 times             key code 126 -- up             delay 0.1         end repeat         repeat 50 times             key code 125 -- down             delay 0.1         end repeat         delay 0.5     end repeat end tell /code/pre  See Events.h or my website for the key codes.  <comment112550> What goes wrong when you try? It's hard to help you more without knowing what isn't working. <comment112551> Alright so my application is PokeMMO and I got an AppleScript Error <comment112552> it says PokeMMO got an error: AppleEvent timed out <comment112553> That is exactly what happens <comment112557> Alright so my application is PokeMMO and I got an AppleScript Error it says PokeMMO got an error: AppleEvent timed out <comment112559> Try adding the delay as @Lauri Ranta suggests. With the apps I've tried it with, I don't get a problem, but I've never worked with "PokeMMO". <comment112562> Alright so the delay one does not include the application in it. Also, the application requires a login at the beginning that I can do myself so is there a way I can activate the applescript program after I have already logged in so it doesn't have to activate PokeMMO it just like tells PokeMMO to press the keys? <comment112566> Alright so the delay one does not include the application in it.
