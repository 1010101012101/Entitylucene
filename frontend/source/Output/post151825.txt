Microsoft Remote Desktop local redirection? <body> I have a Windows 7 Virtual Machine setup, that I remote into using my Macbook Pro. I'm using Microsoft Remote Desktop 2014, and have Folder Redirection setup. I don't see where the redirected folders are supposed to show up on my VM? It should be a folder called Projects. Screenshot below shows no redirected folders:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KWF19.png" alt="Redirection setup" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gDnp6.png" alt="VM view"  Thank you  <answer151834> It should show up under strongDevices with Removable Storage/strong.  When you add the folder in Remote Desktop try clicking browse when adding the folder and confirm its the right path to the projects folder.  <comment178691> Oh ok! Thanks I'll check that out and follow up. <comment179270> I added the folder again, and didn't show up still on my VM. I had it correct before. Don't know what to do :( <comment281099> It's showing up now, updated permissions on a fresh VM
