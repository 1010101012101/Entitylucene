How to remove only News from Siri Suggestions <body> How do I remove emonly News/em from Siri Suggestions?  I like the quick access to frequently used apps and contacts there.  I don't like being informed of the latest murder spree, political news, or military calamity every time I'm just trying to get to the Mail app or find my wife's contact.
