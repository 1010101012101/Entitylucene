Does deleting Mac App Store apps in Launchpad delete related files in the Library folders too? <body> When I delete Mac App Store apps in Launchpad, does it delete related files in the Library folders too? I mean files like preferences, application support files etc.  <answer58960> I tried uninstalling some applications, and files in these folders or the corresponding folders in code~/Library/Containers//code were sometimes deleted and sometimes not:  ul licode~/Library/Caches//code (deleted for most applications)/li licode~/Library/Application Support//code/li /ul  Files in these folders weren't deleted for any of the applications I tested with:  ul licode~/Library/Preferences//code/li licode~/Library/Saved Application State//code/li licode/var/db/receipts//code/li licode~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports//code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/CrashReporter//code/li licode~/Library/Caches/com.plausiblelabs.crashreporter.data//code/li licode~/Library/Application Support/Growl/Tickets//code/li /ul  For example Kindle books or the database for notes in JustNotes were not deleted.  You can see what files are accessed by uninstalld with codesudo opensnoop -n uninstalld/code and search for support files with codemdfind $(osascript -e 'id of app "AppName"')/code. If you want to uninstall applications more completely, it's probably safe to just delete the whole sandbox containers in code~/Library/Containers//code.  <comment67985> Maybe Apple records which one of the two contradictions is respected by developers of an app, then `uninstalld` refers to that record when evaluating whether it's acceptable to remove application support data. It's not acceptable to remove user data. <comment68050> Thank you for this answer. This helps me understand the system better. So what gets removed is the decision of the developers? :-) <comment68056> Advice in the Mac Developer Library is somewhat contradictory. Emphasis added by me … Application Support [**CAN** include files that contain user data](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGUide/MacOSXDirectories/MacOSXDirectories.html) (2012-03-08); and [files should be app-specific but should **NEVER** store user data](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/AppRuntime/AppRuntime.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010543-CH2-SW9) (2012-07-23). <comment68070> @GrahamPerrin Sorry, I forgot to post a comment after rolling back your edit. I think "user data" can mean both documents that would normally be opened by the user and something like SQLite files. <comment68088> @Lri no problem, the content was easily replaced as a comment. As an example, I never liked Microsoft's use of `~/Documents` for *databases* of user data (for Outlook etc.); `~/Library/Application Support` seemed more appropriate. I still don't like to find databases – not human readable – amongst my readable documents. If Apple's guidance to developers is changing, I wonder about the motivation. Maybe WWDC 2012 videos, or other developer documentation, will hold clues. Meantime, my first guess is that future plans for iCloud play a part.
