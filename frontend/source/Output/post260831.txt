How to reset security questions if I forgot them <body> I've forgotten security questions to my account and I want to reset them. I've logged into my Apple ID, went to security section, and went ahead and clicked the link which says "Reset security questions?" in case I've forgotten it, which is my case.  I've entered my password, and it is asking for the answers of the  very security questions that I'm trying to reset. What is the point of asking the answers after clicking the link to reset them in the case that I've forgotten it?  Am I doing something wrong?  <answer260933> If you can't remember your answers ...
