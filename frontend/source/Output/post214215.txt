Login to OneDrive OS X with School/Company account <body> Is there a way to login and access your OneDrive account with the OneDrive application from the Mac Store with your school/company account? At the moment, my credentials are not recognized.  <answer214221> I didn't know there were two separate versions of OneDrive, one for schools/companies, that is called emOneDrive Business/em and one for normal Microsoft Accounts that is just called emOneDrive/em. According to the official homepage OneDrive for Business is not available (yet) for OS X. Although as stated here, it is coming and a preview version is available for download now. And fortunately, it works.      OneDrive for Business is also making its debut on OS X today, in the form of a sync client available as a public preview from the Microsoft Download Center.   <comment258594> Does it work if you log in from within the school? <comment258598> Unfortunately not. For example with Office 365/Office 2016 for OS X, when I enter my schools mail address in the login to One Drive form, it redirects me to the login page from my university, but the OneDrive for OS X app doesn't. <comment258601> So maybe the credentials are just wrong? <comment258602> I used the wrong version, I don't exactly know why there are separate versions of one drive, but anyhow I needed OneDrive for Business. Thanks anyhow!
