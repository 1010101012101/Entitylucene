Flash doesn't appear in my Chromium "chrome://plugins" page <body> I recently upgraded Chromium manually from http://build.chromium.org  I tried loading some Flash content and it won't load.  First I was thinking that maybe there's a problem with the plugin so I went to "codechrome://plugins/code", it wasn't there, I tried installing, still wasn't there.  Went to code/Applications/Chromium.app/Contents/Versions/42.0.2286.0/Chromium Framework.framework/Internet Plug-Ins//code, there was no PepperFlash directory.  I copied from Google Chrome, reloaded Chromium, still nothing (No content and nothing appears in codechrome://plugins/code).  Tried installing the Pepper Flash specifically from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/ (Selecting My current Mac version and the PPAPI plugin from the other list below).  Still not working.  Any additional ideas? I'm really frustrated.  <answer170673> You can try to use the system-flashplayer, but you have to enable "Enable NPAPI Mac, Windows" in about:flags first.  <answer221616> I set "Enable" to Enable Input IME API Windows, Linux in chrome://flags/ on my Win 64 Chromium and got the Flash Player in chrome://plugins/  <comment241261> It seems that Chromium no longer supports NPAPI. No NPAPI in about:flags. Also I saw this info on one ubuntu forum. <comment241262> I've found official blog http://blog.chromium.org/2013/09/saying-goodbye-to-our-old-friend-npapi.html <comment268456> I guess you wanted to comment to the thread above. :)
