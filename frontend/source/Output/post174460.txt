Spoofing app focus <body> I have a game that I want to leave running in the background to progress various in-game activities (production of units, harvesting of resources), but the game pauses whenever it loses focus.  Is there a way I can spoof this so that it thinks it's the active window when it actually isn't?  <comment205484> In Yosemite there is a power saving/multi-thread optimizing agent that sorts your CPUs priority based on what is being currently utilized by the user. Think along the lines of limiting power to apps loaded but not currently in use on an iPhone. Maybe someone knows how to whitelist your game from this functionality? <comment205488> I don't believe it's pausing due to less CPU priority.  I'm fairly certain it pauses the moment I click on something else because it's receiving some type of event from the OS. <comment205489> Isn't that the definition of pausing because of priority? Ceasing tax on the cpu when a program is no longer is the active window? <comment205491> If that were the case, wouldn't all my programs completely stop when I click to a different one (I should mention it's still visible on my second monitor - I'm not covering it up or minimizing it). <comment205492> Only if those programs also maintained the same level of background priority as the game. The parts of programs that remain running and the amount of cpu that they receive is controlled by two separate things neither of which I know more than of their existence. But I'm sure someone will come along with some sort of command line modification to remedy this for you no worries.
