What makes a "Special folder" - a bundle in the finder <body> I know applications are just folder bundles - I assume specifically formatted, and some metadata. I did a copy of my iPhoto Library from another disk - at first it was just another folder, then once I ran iPhoto, it became special again.  What makes a folder a bundle? and how do i restore that metadata on a disk recovery?  <answer67189> The extension of the folder determines if the folder is a special folder. For example, apps have the extension code.app/code, Kernel Extensions have the extensions code.kext/code, etc.  Some folders, like the iPhoto Library, have extended attributes. They can be determined by running codels -@l/code in the parent directory of your folder. The attribute codecom.apple.FinderInfo/code stores the type of the folder.   The easiest way to copy the attributes, in my personal opinion, is to use the codeditto/code Terminal command to copy the files. It works just like codecp/code, except that it also ensures that extended attributes are copied.
