Software for Mac OS X to view movies on my PS3 or Xbox 360 <body> I want to see movies that are on my Mac on the screen connected to my PS3 or Xbox 360  <answer3229> I am using Vuze for that: http://www.vuze.com/features/device Not sure if there are any alternatives for OSX.  <answer3238> I use MediaLink, which lets you use your Mac as a server which the PS3 can connect to for music, pictures, and movies.  It seems to work well enough; my only problem is that I don't like the PS3's interface for browsing through large collections of things.  For example, when sharing my entire iTunes library, I'm just about restricted to playlists or random shuffle -- pulling a particular artist/album/song out of thousands is just a pain.  For movies, it's worked just fine for me.  <answer3248> I use Rivet for streaming to my PS3. It's completely painless to set up, while I've had trouble with another solution in the past (unfortunately I can't remember the name of that one).  <answer3278> Nullriver Software:   Medialink - PS3  Connect360 - Xbox360  <answer3285> PS3mediaserver  Supposedly works with XBox 360 as well.  Supports streaming and transcoding.  <comment3007> Works for the Xbox 360 as well! <comment3017> I have used Connect360 for the last few years. Very solid and works nice, but I would recommend Rivet above it I think.
