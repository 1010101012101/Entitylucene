Show my most recently sent message on top in Mac Mail <body> In Mac Mail I'd like to see the most recently sent message - whether it is my reply or the senders email - on top in list preview and also in the detailed view window. This doesn't seem to be possible. In list view even if I were the last person to write, my message is only visible if I expand all messages. In detail view the top message which automatically loads is the last message by the sender and I have to scroll up to see my sent message even if it is newer.  I wonder how I can fix this. Thanks.

However, there are preferences that may impact on the expansion.  So, let's try the following:  ul liIn Mail, go to Mail  Preferences/li liClick on the Viewing tab/li liEnsure the emInclude related messages/em checkbox is ticked/li liEnsure the emShow most recent messages/em at the top checkbox is ticked/li liExit Preferences/li liNow within Mail go to your Inbox/li liEnsure the filter at top left is sorted strongby date/strong and that emNewest Message on Top/em is ticked/li liGo to the View menu and ensure that emOrganise by Conversation/em is ticked/li liGo to the View menu and select Expand All Conversations (Note: This won't place a tick there, it just expands them)/li /ul  After doing the above you should get something close to what you want.
