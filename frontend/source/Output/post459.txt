Can anyone recommend a decent free stop watch widget for MacOSX? <body> I would like something that is simple to use.  <answer463> I know 2 of them:  ol liStopWatchWidget/li litTimer/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fMyk.png" alt="alt text"img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uK2n1.png" alt="alt text"  <answer465> Depending on the functionalities you want :   ul liSimple &amp; Design : iChrono  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5gARc.jpg" alt="ichrono"/li liMore features &amp; like a real stopwatch : Stopwatch widget  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O22lQ.png" alt="stopwatch widget"/li /ul  <answer518> It's not a dashboard widget, but the Apimac Timer application is free (there's a paid Pro version with additional features) and functions as a stopwatch, countdown timer, and alarm clock. Nice and handy.   http://www.apimac.com/timer/ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3m83.png" alt="alt text" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0QiCV.png" alt="alt text" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLDp6.png" alt="alt text"  <answer560> Menubar Countdown is good if you just want to countdown something http://capablehands.net/menubarcountdown  License Menubar Countdown is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.  <answer565> For counting down a repeating task, Pomodoro is useful (and free): http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/  <answer43900> strongNot a widget/strong, but since there's always a browser around, the strongTimer Tab web app/strong does the trick for me.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0Ajr.png" alt="Timer-Tab.com" title="Timer-Tab.com"  Here's a selection of features:  ul listrongtimer/strong + strongalarm clock/strong + strongstopwatch/strong/li listrongworks offline/strong/li listrongfullscreen/strong countdown by clicking on the countdown/li listrongkeyboard control/strong:  ul likbd→/kbd, kbd←/kbd, kbd↑/kbd, kbd↓/kbd: control inputs, /li likbdf/kbd: toggle fullscreen, /li likbdspace/kbd: toggle pause/li /ul/li listrongcustomizable/strong:  ul liaudio alarm: any Youtube clip /li libackground: any image on the web/li /ul/li licountdown in the browser tab title and tab icon/li /ul  hr  Now, if Chrome happens to be the browser of your choice, there's also the Chrome app, providing you with some extra features:  ul lioptional sound and Chrome notification/li liuse the "tab to search" chrome feature to set the timer/li lietc./li /ul  hr  Now, it's up to you to consider if this is a reasonable emalternative to a widget/em.  <comment487> couldn't you add this to the best apps? <comment732> Why the downvote? <comment733> It claims that I can't install iChrono widget as it is not a valid widget :-( <comment734> That is a very nice solution for when I want to keep track of how much time is left, but sometimes I want to set and forget <comment735> @Casebash must asks whom voted. <comment938> @Casebash, strange. I just installed iChrono without problems on my  mac. I run 10.6.4. <comment46422> Goodness, that first one is grotesque. <comment49900> but it's not a widget, as requested by the OP. <comment49910> @DanielL agreed, and thanks for emphasizing it. I've edited my response to make it clearer that this is **not a widget**, but an *alternative*. <comment49918> Unless of course, it can be made into a web clip and retain the necessary functionality?
