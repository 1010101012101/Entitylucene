Pages: pasted images are too large <body> Whenever I drag and drop an image into Pages from (for example) my browser, the image is resized to roughly 2x the original size. This causes annoying aliassing to occur; especially when taking screenshots and copy-pasting these it causes it to look blurred.  I saw the 'Original size'-button (as suggested here) but when I click it, it just takes the image back to the 2x-size it had when pasting.  Is this something I can configure somewhere? Or should I not drag-and-drop images, but go through the hassle of importing?  <answer121172> This would be due to the difference in resolution.  You will likely need to adjust the size/resolution of your images (can use preview for this).
