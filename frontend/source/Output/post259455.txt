Black Screen on MacBook Pro A1278 <body> I have a MacBook Pro A1278 that recently had a bunch of screen flicker and then the laptop display went out completely. The system boots and I am able to connect an external monitor via a thunderbolt adapter.  Detect display doesn't show the presence of the laptop display just the external monitor.   Pretty new to Macs was wondering if there was anything to look at or test or if this seems like a clear screen replacement project.   <answer259481> h2Have you tried resetting the strongSMC/strong (System Management Controller)?/h2  With charger plugged in, hold kbdShift/kbd-kbdControl/kbd-kbdOption/kbd on the left side of the keyboard, then press the kbdPower/kbd.
