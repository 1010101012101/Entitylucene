Multitouch redirection to a socket <body> I'm on El Capitan. I am trying to boot Android Emulator. It seems to be trying to find a multitouch device on a certain socket (127.0.0.1:1970) and to establish an handshake.  I tried to open a TCP socket at that port, and got info from the kernel about the timed-out handshake.  So I would try to redirect my touchpad to that port, but I don't know how.
