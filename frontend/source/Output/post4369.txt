How can I view the full name of drop down items on iOS? <body> For a dropdown list on a website, iOS shows only the first few characters and then ellipses for items with a long name. Is it possible to somehow see the full text of each item?  <answer4374> You could try selecting the item and then viewing the dropdown list in strongview/strong mode, not strongselection/strong mode. But As far as I know there is no way, in selection mode, to change how Apple presents the choices.  <comment4213> what do you mean by "view mode"? how do you get to it? <comment4216> I mean when viewing the regular webpage. Perhaps the normal HTML view shows the full text, even if it isn't viewable in selection mode.
