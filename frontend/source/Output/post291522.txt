How can I access vanished encrypted drive after deleting EFI directory by accident <body> I had an encrypted drive with two partitions. I tried to delete reFind but ended up deleting the entire EFI directory through Recovery Mode. Now my encrypted drive doesn't display any of my partitions. I am also unable to mount or unmount any volumes. How can I restore my Mac and reach/recover my encrypted data.  <comment368064> Restore your recent Time Machine(/other backup app) backup! Else: please boot to Internet Recovery Mode, open Terminal in the menubar  Utilities and enter `diskutil list disk0` and `gpt -r show disk0`. Take a pic of the output and add it to your question. Also add your system version!
