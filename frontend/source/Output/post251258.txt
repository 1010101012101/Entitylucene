Mount Android Phone on Desktop <body> Is there a way to mount my Android phone on my Mac Air desktop in order to transfer files like images and music?  <answer251259> Use Android File Transfer, created by Google itself, and it gives you a Finder window to at least transfer files via USB connection. I noticed, however, that you have to use the Samsung cable they provide to power the phone, and not some cheap knockoff USB cable.  It would be nice to have a way for the icon to mount on the desktop via a Bluetooth connection -- but that's just not possible yet.  There is also the free Handshaker application in the Apple Store that is more full-featured and intuitive than Google's Android File Transfer. So far, it's looking like my best option and I don't see quirks except that I had to enable Android Developer Mode and then turn on USB Debugging on, as well as uninstall Android File Exchange because it conflicts with it.  <answer283564> Still, if there was another app to accomplish this, it would be much better as this official app hasn't been updated in over 5 years. Also, handshaker has recently broken. (At least for the time being)  <comment357521> Welcome to Ask Different. Please don't add comments in the _Answer_ field as this is for answers to questions.

I had to download it from their Hong Kong website I think and the chars were in another language. I think I clicked EN or something to see it in English. I then downloaded and it worked just fine. I backed up my old Android and got a new Android. That was last month (April 2017).
