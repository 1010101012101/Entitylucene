Clear Terminal command history <body> I'm trying to clear the history of commands that have been run on Terminal, I found an article which said I can do it with coderm ~/.bash_history/code  However, I am still able to see the previous commands that I've ran by pressing the up arrow  <answer282335> An easy way to accomplish this is to close all terminal windows, and then open a single new terminal window, where you run:  precoderm ~/.bash_history /code/pre  You'll need to close the terminal and open it again. Now when you press arrow up, you'll only see the rm command, and not earlier commands.  <answer282337> The correct command is codehistory -c/code, as shown in the picture below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwIlq.png" alt="history -c"  <comment355564> I have just tried it, and this doesn't work :( <comment355663> I have used this method without problems. You just need to be aware that your current session's history will be saved when you close it. So close all sessions, and create a new one that will have no history to speak off - then clear the file. You can use history -c to the same effect ofcourse, but again if you have open sessions and close them afterwards, then their previous commands would be saved to history as well.
