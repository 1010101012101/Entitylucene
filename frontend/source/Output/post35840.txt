Gamma color problem on Lion <body> I have a MBP with Lion 10.7.2 with an external monitor. When I disconnect the MBP from the external Monitor or when I reconnect it, some application show incorrect gamma color.   It is very difficult for me to explain the aspect variation, but I can solve the problem going into the Monitor preferences - Color profile and choose the profile of my monitor. This work for Finder and Mac app, but no for other application such as Chrome, that I have to close and restart.  I try to put an image with the incorrect color gamma:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8wZz7.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer35878> Try keep pressing command-option-control-comma  <comment40937> what is this command? <comment40938> ok, I found it...but it doesn't change anything (but the gamma yes). So maybe It doesn't be a problem of Gamme... <comment40940> Really?  Because that does sort of look like the contrast problem.  Try going to System Preferences - Universal Access - Seeing - Enhance contrast and check if the slide bar is at normal.  If it is and the problem is still there, I'm afraid I can't help you. <comment40942> Nope...But changing the color profile (select another one and reselect the monitor's one) solves the problem. It's very strange... <comment42207> +1 Thanks, this has fixed my problem! If you are even in London I'll buy you a beer. I've been going NUTS with this issue for weeks, maybe a few months now! Was starting to think my display was broken as I couldn't resolve it though changeling the display profile, I must have mashed command-option-control-period at some point!
