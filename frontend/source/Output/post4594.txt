I downloaded iTunes 10 but now it won't update my iPod Touch software <body> I downloaded the newest version of iTunes because it said it couldn't update the iPod Touch to 4.2 without it, but after the download I went to update my iPod Touch and iTunes said it couldn't contact the update server. This happened when I downloaded iTunes 9 and tried to update, but I never fixed it. Any help would be appreciated!  <answer4614> Is there a error number associated with this error?  Did you check to see if you have an internet connection?  Did you restart your computer?  Did you wait a while and try back later? Apple could be experiencing a downtime when you tried to access their server.  Do you have a firewall on? Is the port open for iTunes?  It could be any number of things...Let me know if this helps!  <answer4621> Would be helpful in narrowing down the cause:   ul liWin or Mac OSX?/li liCurrent version installed? (btw, the latest version is now 4.2.1. A last-minute fix caused the version number to revise)/li /ul  Things that come to mind off-hand:  ul liiTunes version you downloaded is 10.1? (the latest at this moment)/li liFirewall? Antivirus?/li /ul  Worst case: Use the links from this page, or a page like this, to download the image for the new OS manually and perform a backup-and-restore using the image. WARNING: Not for novices!  <comment4464> Can you post the exact error message?
