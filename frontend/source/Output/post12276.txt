Why isn't my MacBook running 64 bit mode? <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   My mac has 64-bit EFI, but it only boots with 32-bit kernel       Why isn't my MacBook running 64 bit mode? It's a mid-2010 model, "MacBook 7,1" , with a Core-2 Duo. why would it run in 32-bit mode? Could it be because I've only got 2GB of RAM?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/puMb6.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer12278> I don't think these machines booted into 64bit. (the new macbook pros do).  You can hold down 6 and 4 whilst rebooting for a temporary 64bit boot (if available)  If that works, you can try this in terminal and then reboot  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.Boot 'Kernel Flags' 'arch=x86_64' /code/pre  This will make the mac boot in 64bit mode by default.  <comment12812> Are there any negative side effects to booting into 64-bit mode? <comment12813> The 64-bit versions of apps take slightly more RAM because they need to hold 64-bit addresses instead of 32-bit. This is only a very minor difference. I can't think of anything else though. <comment12814> like your tip of holding down 6 and 4 key at bootup <comment12820> I don't think this will work for non-Pro MacBooks. <comment12831> Ah yes. Misread that it wasn't a pro.
