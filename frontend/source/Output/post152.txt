iPad virtual keyboard text entry: Way to type multiple capital letters without having to press SHIFT before each letter? <body> Let's say I'm typing a word in ALL-CAPS on the iPad.  Currently, the only way I know of how to do this is to press SHIFT before each of the letters.  Is there an alternative, like a sticky shift or Caps Lock function, where I can just go into a caps mode, type the letters I want as all caps, and then go back to normal text entry?  I've tried keeping my finger on the shift key as well while I type, but that doesn't work as expected.  <answer154> Tap the strongSettings/strong app. and click on the strongGeneral/strong *emmenu/em*  the strongKeyboard/strong. Then turn "Enable Caps Lock" on.  Now just strongemdouble-tap the shift/em/strong key to enable caps lock once using the keyboard.  you can see with image tutorial here.  <answer259> Holding shift ought to work, also. Perhaps that relies on the caps lock option, but it works for me.   <comment358> Works on iPhone as well
