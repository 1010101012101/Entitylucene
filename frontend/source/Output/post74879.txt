How do I get technical information on my video card? (Model, RAM, Mhz, etc) <body> I'd like to get as much technical information about my MacOSX's video card as possible... technical details, even serial number if the card has a unique identifier.  I intend to use this information do research what GPU specific commands I can run on a given laptop.  <answer74881> Look for Graphics/Displays in the output of codesystem_profiler/code.  In mac terminal, type:  system_profiler | grep -A35 Graphics/Displays  The output will show something like this with your card name and details:  precodesystem_profiler | grep -A35 Graphics/Displays  Graphics/Displays:  AMD FirePro D500:    Chipset Model: AMD FirePro D500   Type: GPU   Bus: PCIe   Slot: Slot-2   PCIe Lane Width: x16   VRAM (Total): 3072 MB   Vendor: ATI (0x1002)   Device ID: 0x679e   Revision ID: 0x0000   ROM Revision: 113-C3861J-687   gMux Version: 4.0.11 [3.2.8]   EFI Driver Version: 01.00.687   Displays:     CS230:       Resolution: 1920 x 1080       Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)       Display Serial Number: 27673034       Main Display: Yes       Mirror: Off       Online: Yes       Rotation: Supported     CS230:       Resolution: 1920 x 1080 @ 60Hz (1080p)       Pixel Depth: 32-Bit Color (ARGB8888)       Display Serial Number: 27712034       Mirror: Off       Online: Yes       Rotation: Supported       Television: Yes  AMD FirePro D500: /code/pre  <answer74882> Click on the Apple icon in the upper left hand corner of your menu bar and select codeAbout This Mac/code from the menu.  In the dialog that appears click on the codeMore Info.../code button to bring up the detailed about dialog.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O32oI.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click on the codeSystem Report.../code button and you'll get a split-window dialog that has hardware components down the left side and details on the right.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ppz4.png" alt="enter image description here"  Click on codeGraphics/Displays/code on the left. Pick a graphics card from the right side and you'll see all the details the system provides about it.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8YlVv.png" alt="enter image description here"  You can also get to the System Report by running Applications - Utilities - System Information.  <answer74883> There is a small amount of information in System Information/System Profiler - Graphics and Displays  If you want more, you will have to take apart your Mac and actually look at the graphics card.  <comment86965> Have you looked in Apple Menu - About This Mac? From there, I suspect it all depends on the vendor and model as to where to look next? <comment86966> Wow you were quick on the graphics.  Can you tell me how you did that? <comment86973> I use Skitch: http://evernote.com/skitch/ <comment86984> lol - take it apart. I suppose some learn that way, but a link to an ifixit.com takeapart might be much easier than opening your iMac - especially the newer ones where dust behind the screen is hard to clear for most DIY repairers. <comment86986> Cool. I was wondering if a command line version of System Information existed. <comment87015> A ifixit teardown wouldn't have the OP's serial number, and the OP didn't mention which model his Mac was. <comment87016> It's not clear the OP is looking to ask a general question or wants someone to do the work for a specific Mac. Both answers are of course welcome to a vague question. Luckily, we have questions and answers on how to take a serial number and determine the model of hardware for people with that question. <comment87024> `lspci -nn` or something similar from the command line would work
