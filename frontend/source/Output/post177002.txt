Show hidden files from windows PC on Mac <body> I created some hidden files in windows and copied them on pen drive. Now i want to see those files in Mac but not able to see. please tell how i can see those files ? thanks  <answer177013> This post seems like the most likely answer to your question. In Terminal, codecd/code to your drive where codels/code should list all files, including your hidden ones. To 'unhide' a file in Finder, type   precodechflags nohidden [folder name] /code/pre  Where [folder name] is obviously the name of your hidden folder.  Note I've confirmed this working on my Mac running OSX.10 Yosemite and an NTFS formatted drive from Windows XP x64 professional.  <comment209203> How did you format the pen drive? What do you see when you plug the pen drive into the Mac? <comment209209> Pen drive was formatted on windows (quick format). when i plug pen drive into mac, i see no hidden files. <comment209210> How are the files hidden (sorry I have forgotten some Windows things) <comment209211> right click the folder and then select HIDE. i hide the folder which contained my files
