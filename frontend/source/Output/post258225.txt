An error occured while trying to use graphics in minitab17 <body> A couple of days ago I managed to install Minitab 17 on my MacBook Air (macOS Sierra v. 10.12) following the steps outlined on the Daviv Baumgold site. Minitab is a statistical program. In order to open Minitab I need to use the terminal. Today, I tried to open a Minitab file, code.mtw/code and making a graphical plot (scatter plot) with the data in that file. But instead of a dialog box that let me proceed further, I'm getting the following error message:     Unable to open dialog. A necessary script component could not be   initialized.   How can I resolve this issue?  Thank you
