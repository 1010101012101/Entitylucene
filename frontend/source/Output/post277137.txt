How to set "Next Input Source" shortcut in macOS Sierra to Shift + Cmd? <body> It seems not possible to set "Next Input Source" shortcut in macOS Sierra to kbd⇧ Shift/kbd + kbd⌘ cmd/kbd with the default OS facilities at the moment.   emIt there a way to do it with any third-party applications?/em  <comment348821> That would preclude you from ever using shift/cmd/anything_else, which is presumably why the system won't let you do it. <comment348822> It makes sense, thank you for the remark! Still, I would like to use that shortcut for now, even if i brings such restrictions.
