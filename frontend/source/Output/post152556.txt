Can you place a shortcut or a link to a website in the dock in osx? <body> Is there a way you can place a shortcut or a link to a website in the dock in osx ? Similar to how you can save a website to the homescreen of ios.  Id like to do this on 2 machines - one is on osx 10.9 and one is on 10.8.  <answer152559> ol liSelect URL and drag it to your desktop./li liDrag the newly created shortcut to your Dock*. /li /ol  emOptional/em:  ol start="3" liIf you want to add a custom image, there are instructions in this Ask Different thread. /li /ol  * In Yosemite, at least, it can only be placed on the right pane of the Dock.  <answer152560> Yes. Here are the steps:  ol liCreate a Bookmark (Chrome/Firefox) or Favorite (Safari) of the sites you want linked./li liOpen up the Bookmarks/Favorites bar, and locate the bookmark you just created./li liDrag the bookmark with the mouse onto your Desktop./li liNow drag the webloc that was created from your Desktop onto the dock./li /ol  Optional: If you don't want the link to live on your desktop, you can drag it into a different Finder folder. If you want the link to have a different icon, you can simply set a different icon in Finder.  <comment179536> Nice one, with extras :) that is a + from me. FYI it also works on Mavericks (placing it in the right part of the Dock) <comment243343> The dock has a separator, left is applications, right are folder aliases.  The dock has worked this way for many versions of OS X.
