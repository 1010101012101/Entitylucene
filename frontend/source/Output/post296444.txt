Bad stdio forwarding specification '%h:%p <body> I am on macOS Sierra, and my SSH version is : codeOpenSSH_7.5p1, OpenSSL 1.0.2l  25 May 2017/code  I have this content in my code.ssh/config/code :  precodeHost db   User user   HostName 192.168.1.111   ProxyCommand ssh user@db -W %h:%p  Host website   User user   HostName 192.168.1.100   ProxyCommand ssh user@Website -W %h:%p /code/pre  I also have a server with a public IP, that has direct connection with these two servers, I want to forward my SSH connection through this public server to my private servers (db and website).  When I use this command:  precodessh user@db -W %h:%p /code/pre  I get this error:   precodeBad stdio forwarding specification '%h:%p' /code/pre  Now, what should I do to solve this problem and connect my macOS host to my private servers?  <answer296455> Your config file as well as the command are wrong.  The ProxyCommand line should contain the JumpHost's user/hostname strongbut not/strong the final destination.  Config file:  precodeHost db   User dbuser   HostName 192.168.1.111 #db host name/IP   ProxyCommand ssh user_public_server@public_server -W %h:%p  Host website   User websiteuser   HostName 192.168.1.100 #website host name/IP   ProxyCommand ssh user_public_server@public_server -W %h:%p /code/pre  The command is then simply codessh db/code or codessh website/code because the user friendly Host's name (e.g. db) as defined in the config file is expanded to the HostName/IP (e.g. 192.168.1.111).
