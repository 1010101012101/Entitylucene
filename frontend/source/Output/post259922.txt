change all wallpapers script <body> I know it's possible to change all the wallpapers for a mac at once, as I had a script to do this in the past (disclaimer: I didn't write it, but can't remember where it came from).  I've upgraded OS (now on El Capitan) since I last used it though and I think Apple must have changed something as the script no longer does it's job.  Anyone know what needs to be changed to get it working again?  precode#!/bin/bash #script to change all desktop backgrounds  echo -n “Drag and drop an image file here then press ‘return’ or press ‘control-c’ to cancel…” read -e WLPR;  function change_wallpaper { defaults write com.apple.desktop Background “{default = {ImageFilePath=’$WLPR’; };}”; killall Dock }  change_wallpaper /code/pre  <comment325325> Won't be a drag and drop... but can specify where image is. `$ osascript -e 'tell application "Finder" to set desktop picture to POSIX file "~/Desktop/cabo-san-lucas.jpg"'` <comment325330> Or if that gives a syntax error, try this... `osascript -e 'tell Application "Finder"' -e 'set the desktop picture to {"NAME OF STARTUP DRIVE:PATH:TO:PICTURE.jpg"} as alias' -e 'end tell'`
