Enabling Apple Wallet / Apple Pay on Non-US iPhone <body> I have an iPhone that I own outright from Australia (Model A1586). I have recently relocated to the US and have a US Visa card that is compatible with Apple Pay.  However, I do not have any Wallet or Pay options on my iPhone at all.  Is there any way I can add this to my phone?  <answer206069> Go to codeSettings -&gt; General -&gt; Language &amp; Region -&gt; Region/code and choose United States. After that Apple Pay should appear in the main Settings menu.
