ARD hangs on launch <body> I have purchased, downloaded and installed Apple Remote Desktop 3.7.2 from the Mac App Store (onto a computer that's running OS X Yosemite 10.10.1).  When I first open the app, I am prompted to agree to the licence.  Once I indicate my acceptance to its terms, the licence dialog disappears and the app stops responding (nothing further is displayed and the cursor turns to a spinning wheel if I try to access the unresponsive menubar; I am left with no choice but to force-quit the application).  Executing the app binary directly reveals the following messages on stderr:  precode2014-12-11 20:26:54.654 Remote Desktop[44453:2412661] *** -[__NSSetM addObject:]: object cannot be nil 2014-12-11 20:26:54.655 Remote Desktop[44453:2412661] (     0   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff85b6264c __exceptionPreprocess + 172     1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x00007fff8f1a16de objc_exception_throw + 43     2   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff85a6fcb9 -[__NSSetM addObject:] + 329     3   Remote Desktop                      0x0000000101a92fcb Remote Desktop + 1974219     4   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff85b1ecbc __CFNOTIFICATIONCENTER_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_AN_OBSERVER__ + 12     5   CoreFoundation                      0x00007fff85a101b4 _CFXNotificationPost + 3140     6   Foundation                          0x00007fff932abea1 -[NSNotificationCenter postNotificationName:object:userInfo:] + 66     7   AppKit                              0x00007fff92561187 -[NSApplication finishLaunching] + 440     8   AppKit                              0x00007fff92560c51 -[NSApplication run] + 128     9   AppKit                              0x00007fff9254c2d4 NSApplicationMain + 1832     10  Remote Desktop                      0x000000010191af23 Remote Desktop + 433955     11  Remote Desktop                      0x00000001018b3634 Remote Desktop + 9780     12  ???                                 0x0000000000000001 0x0 + 1 ) 2014-12-11 20:26:54.768 Remote Desktop[44453:2412661] *** -[NSLock lock]: deadlock (&lt;NSLock: 0x7fa01b48a830&gt; '(null)') 2014-12-11 20:26:54.768 Remote Desktop[44453:2412661] *** Break on _NSLockError() to debug. /code/pre  I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling ARD, to no avail&mdash;although it may be significant to note that, besides code/Applications/Remote Desktop.app/code and code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.RemoteDesktop/code, none of the expected file paths exist.  What's going on?  How can I get ARD to work?  <answer275803> One issue I have noted that causes a hang on launch of the Apple Remote Desktop admin app is when the ARDAgent process can't be reached.  Killing the ARDAgent process fixes the hang-on-launch.  Here is one way to kill ARDAgent:  ol liOpen /Applications/Utilities/Activity Monitor.app/li liSelect the "CPU" tab./li liIn the search box, type "ARDAgent". You should see two ARDAgent processes, one running as user 'nobody', one running as you./li liSelect the ARDAgent process belonging to user 'nobody', and choose the "X" symbol on the toolbar to kill the process. In the dialog that pops up, choose "Force Quit"./li /ol  <comment188658> There's an Apple KB article on uninstalling ARD: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201766 <comment188659> @pknz: I'm already aware of that article (indeed, I linked to it from my question!).  Are you suggesting it should solve my problem?  Have I overlooked something?  Please elaborate. <comment188661> Sorry! Skimmed over that. Have you tried opening from another user account? <comment188682> @pknz: Yesâ€”no difference. <comment364188> Quitting the one running as me was enough here.
