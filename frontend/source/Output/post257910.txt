IP Printer Setup with Sharp Printer won't work on Mac <body> I downloaded the updated print driver followed verbatim the apple instructions to installing printers using IP Addresses option but it still doesn't work. I input the ip address to the printer and it acknowledges the printer (Sharp MX-2610) but it doesn't print it when I try printing a test page. It gives me the error of being unable to find the printer but when I print anything else using the same ip address on another mac printer it works just fine. Alternative solutions please!  <comment322298> What kind of computer are you using? What operating system? We need more information to try to help you? <comment322302> Have you [reset the printer to factory settings](http://resetprinters.com) and reconfigured? <comment322322> The log files are in `/var/log/cups/`. See anything interesting in those?
