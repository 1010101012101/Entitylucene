How to socksify apps in mac os <body> Is there an analog on mac os for http://linux.die.net/man/1/socksify ? So that i can use it like on linux: socksify mongo ....  <answer107061> ProxyCap might be what you are looking for. It allows you to socksify a command line program as well as a complete app bundle.  <answer251604> I use proxychains-ng which can be configured to use a SOCKS proxy. It is available via Homebrew: codebrew install proxychains-ng/code.  Note there is a known limitation on 10.11+ that SIP prevents hooking of system binaries - see GitHub issue #78 - but it can be used with anything installed via Homebrew, as the binaries are in directories not affected by SIP. For example, to use (Homebrew installed &amp; linked) codecurl/code through a Tor SOCKS proxy, your code.proxychains/proxychains.conf/code would look like this:  precode[ProxyList] socks5  127.0.0.1   9050 /code/pre  Check codecurl/code is Homebrew, not system version:  precode$ which curl /usr/local/bin/curl /code/pre  codeproxychains4 curl http://ipinfo.io/code then does this:  precode[proxychains] config file found: /Users/me/.proxychains/proxychains.conf [proxychains] preloading /usr/local/Cellar/proxychains-ng/4.11/lib/libproxychains4.dylib [proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.11 [proxychains] Dynamic chain  ...  127.0.0.1:9050  ...  52.58.99.202:80  ...  OK {   "ip": "194.71.109.74",   "hostname": "tor.keff.org",   "city": "Stockholm",   "region": "Stockholm",   "country": "SE",   "loc": "59.3333,18.0500",   "org": "AS41281 Scaling Networks AB",   "postal": "173 11" } /code/pre  The README caveats explain why it does not work for everything, but it may be worth a try.  <comment125185> I think the Apple socks only fit iOS devices and iPods ;-) http://i.imgur.com/kjeG3T9.jpg
