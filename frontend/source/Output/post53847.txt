Has anyone found a download for a Mountain Lion resembling Dock theme? <body> Mountain Lion has a SWEET new Dock look that I'd love to replicate into my Lion install. Has anyone found a download link for any kind of fan art resembling it accurately, yet?  <answer53848> It's not quite right, but this can be installed with Dock Library and is off by a mere few pixels.  http://cl.ly/0B271a1g3Y302E0t0w41
