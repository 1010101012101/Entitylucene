OmniDazzle alternative for modern Macs? <body> Is there any tool that runs on current Macs providing a flashlight effect to highlight a portion on the screen?  In the past I've used OmniDazzle to create screen casts using this effect. On recent OS X versions it doesn't work any more, though..  Any hint appreciated!  <answer170809> Yes, I'd recommend Mouseposé. It's very similar in spirit to OmniDazzle but works with recent versions of Mac OS X.  One nice feature is that if you pause for a little bit, Mouseposé will expand the highlight from the pointer to the whole window.  <comment200887> Looks great, cheers! Though horribly expensive for a util that does pretty much one thing only ;-) <comment200888> Sometimes you can get it in a "big bundle," which is how I have my copy. :-)
