Safari homepage hijacked and I can't change back <body> imac 2011 10.10.5  Safari had homepage hijacked and I can't change it back to google.com.  When I go to Safari preferences and try and change, it just immediately goes to www.rack-search.com/....  I tried deleting all the com.apple.safari.plists in library.  Can you help?  <answer290544> Seems you appear to have adware.  There's a free program the Apple Store and Apple Phone support even recommends called MalwareBytes. The website is adwaremedic.com.  Once you run it, you'll probably need to reboot and again reset your browser home page.    <answer290617> Maybe you have a modified codehosts/code file which redirects google to rack-search.br * Check your code/etc/hosts/code with codecat /etc/hosts/code from the terminal or,br * open it in a text editor (in Finder select Go - Go to Folder, and enter /etc/ in the dialog. The folder /etc should be visible in the Finder. From there select the hosts file &amp; control click on it. Select Open With and choose your editor.)    An unmodified hosts file looks like this:  precode## ## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting. Do not change this entry. ## 127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1 localhost fe80::1%lo0 localhost /code/pre  If you have any other entries below these lines, delete those and save the hosts file.br MacOS' default text editor TextEdit will not let you save this file, so use one like BBedit, TextMate, Sublime Text, or use a terminal based editor like vim, nano or emacs.  <comment366747> I installed and ran MBAM.  I also trashed some malware programs that were installed.  Anything else I can do to get my homepage back? <comment366748> What page is your browser redirecting you to? <comment366750> www.rack-search.com/.... <comment367039> Just checked the Host Database and there was nothing extra in it.        Any other ideas? <comment367054> You could try to flush your DNS cache. See: [How to Flush DNS Cache in Mac OS X](http://osxdaily.com/2008/03/21/how-to-flush-your-dns-cache-in-mac-os-x/)
