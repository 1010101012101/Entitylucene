Video card issues or Software Issue? <body> Purchased an MBP in 2010, very happy with it. Just recently I started using and external monitor(closed the lid on the MBP) and now I get screen issues like the ones in the picture below. Is having it connected to a non apple monitor causing this? anyone got a clue as to what could be happening? (first apple product so any info is greatly appreciated)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zwYCN.jpg" alt="This the daily setup" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K0PbI.jpg" alt="A tasted of the issue I get" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a3lcC.jpg" alt="a closer look"  <comment95794> My google searches point to it being a logic board issue: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3629505?start=0&tstart=0 <comment95797> "Flashing checkerboard pattern" - why did I not think of that search query!. It appears that you are correct @MichaelPryor. Thank you for your assistance.
