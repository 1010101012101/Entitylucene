"A descriptive string set at run-time. Don't localize."? <body> When I open Safari, in my Bookmarks tab it shows me a pop-up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zpmZc.png" alt="A descriptive string set at run-time. Don&#39;t localize."  What does this mean?  <answer152540> It appears to be an internal testing message for localization. Are you using a beta version of Safari? or have you in the past? It may be a case of resetting safari content if so.  <comment179516> Yosemite just showed me a notification to try out the new Safari, so I clicked it and that showed up at the bottom. I just tried to click Keep and Don't Keep, and neither button does anything, so it seems to just be a bug.
