How can I access iCloud documents/files from an iOS device? <body> I completed a Numbers document on my Mac, saved to iCloud and now tried to open/read it on my iPhone 4S.  I can see it listed in emSettings &#x2192; Manage Storage/em, but how do I retrieve it?  <answer63221> You can do so from the Numbers app on iOS. You donâ€™t open it from manage storage. You open the app in which the document was created, on the iPhone.  <comment76962> Same thing goes for other file types such as Pages and Keynote.
