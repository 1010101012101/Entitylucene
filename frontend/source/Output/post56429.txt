How to create a hidden partition on a hard drive? <body> I have created 3 partitions on a hard drive.  I've tried renaming the partition with a dot in front, however it seems that the OS doesn't allow that.  How to make one of the 3 partitions hidden to the user?  <answer56440> My previous answer is preserved below.  You can use the codechflags/code command to apply the codehidden/code attribute:  precodechflags hidden /Volumes/Hide_this_disk /code/pre  And to unhide:  precodechflags nohidden /Volumes/Hide_this_disk /code/pre  These commands should take effect immediately.  hr  You need to have the Apple Developer strongCommand Line Tools/strong installed. You can either get them from inside of Xcode (in strongPreferences/strong under strongDownloads/strong) or you can download them from Apple's Developer website (free registration required).  After it's installed you'll have the codeSetFile/code command:  precodeSetFile -a V /Volumes/Hide_this_disk /code/pre  This needs to be executed as coderoot/code, and it won't vanish right away. But after remounting it, it won't be displayed in the Finder any more. You'll need to use strongDisk Utility/strong (or codediskutil/code) to mount and unmount the disk afterward since it won't be visible to unmount and it will still be available under code/Volumes/code normally.  If it's an internal disk then I embelieve/em that it will auto-mount at boot, but I don't know for certain.  To make it visible again just run the same thing, but with a small codev/code:  precodeSetFile -a v /Volumes/Hide_this_disk /code/pre  Again, you'll need to remount it.  <comment64783> Hidden in what way? Not mounted by default? Mounted but not displayed as a volume? Something else? <comment64785> Mounted but not displayed on the desktop <comment64788> Thanks, though I just realized that an easier way to do this is to use chflags instead.  I think it does the same thing, but it doesn't require the command line tools installed. <comment64790> Ah, that's right. I couldn't remember the name of the other command. Updating my answer to include that.
