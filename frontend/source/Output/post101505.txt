Screen Sharing from windows to mac with no software on the windows computer <body> My issue: I have a computer at home that is a mac. I am able to open ports and anything of the sort. I currently have setup my mac so that I can VNC from any computer, but the problem:  There is a PC that I would like to screen share to my mac from. On this PC there are parental controls preventing me from installing any applications.  My idea was to use a rdp server on mac, but I was unable to find one that would compile on OS X 10.6
