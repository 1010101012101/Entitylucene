Migrating Local Folders from Thunderbird to Mail.app <body> I am moving from Thunderbird to Mac mail on my iMac running OSX. If I uninstall Thunderbird will the local folders I created in Thunderbird remain on my computer for importing later?  I don't want to bring all of them over now, but would like to have the option of doing so at a later date.  I don't want to uninstall Tbird and then have the local folders disappear.  <answer63091> All your Thunderbird data, including the local mail data is stored in the Profile folder, located either at code~/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;/,/code or "code~/Library/Application Support/Thunderbird/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;//code.  Deleting the Thunderbird app won't delete any of the data there, unless you use a 3rd party uninstalled app like AppZapper. You can of course make a manual backup of those folders for added safety.  <comment72807> How will you uninstall Thunderbird?
