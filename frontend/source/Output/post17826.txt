Why won't my iPad sync photos ("not enough memory") when it's half empty? <body> When I try to sync my iPad, it aborts on the last step, indicating that it can't be synced, becuase "not enough memory is available":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HQGLK.png" alt="enter image description here"  But I have LOTS of room:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q8qCj.png" alt="enter image description here"  And it all fit before - I actually have about 8GB of photos that all fit with  ~20GB to spare until today.   The above image is after I set it to only sync the last 20 photo projects (I'm using aperture) to see if space was really an issue, and it's clearly not.  However, photos emdo/em seem to be a part of the problem:   strongif i turn off photo sync, it works, but if I reduce the photos being synced (sunk? syunk?) to a de minimis number, it doesn't./strong  The catalyst for the problem is pretty likely either the new version of itunes or of OSX, as both were upgraded just before the problem manifested.  Any help?  I miss my pictures.   <answer17838> I have had iTunes go off the deep end thinking there were far too many photos.  I have had luck with several tacks so I presume there are a few bugs - one of which you may have run into:  ol liTake the device to another computer (or another iTunes library on a shell account) and let it sync and erase all photos on iOS. Taking it back to the main iTunes library which has the correct photos sometimes works. I presume the error was an accounting one on the iPad when this works./li liChange photo sync to a simple folder with a jpeg or two, sync it, and then change back to the settings I prefer. (rarely works)/li liRebuild the affected library in Aperture or iPhoto - this seems to force new data into the media browser so iTunes is forced to take a better look at the sizes for your albums and photos as organized./li /ol  Sorry I don't have a sure fire answer - but maybe you haven't tried all of these or it sparks an idea of something else you can try.  <answer202775> Okay I Had the same problem when I tried syncing my music on my Iphone I did some messing around with my itunes and I finally found the way to fix it and what I did was unselected evrything that I wanted to sync to my phone basically did a blank sync between my phone and computer which I guess let itunes know what was on my phone and what was on the computer because after I had done that I resulected what I wanted to sync and it worked perfect. Hopes this helps because I spent hours trying to find a solution on the internet and nothing worked.  <comment19491> There is a bug in 10.3 and lower where if you select "compress songs" to save space on the iOS device - it makes bad guesses on the free space. I don't think it's the cause with such a HUGE gap - but worth a shot. <comment19492> @bmike, I'm assuming the toggle you're referencing is "convert higher bit rate songs to 128 kbps AAC"?  If so, that's not it - I've never had it on. <comment19497> Bummer. That's the switch that drives me nuts on my 14G iPhone. I'm ready to move my music to the cloud :-) <comment19915> save your sorry - #3 did the trick.   The key was repairing the library and permissions in Aperture.  If #1 and #2 never caused *this* error for you, you may want to edit your response to focus on #3 and explain how to do it, for folks who don't know:  In Aperture, you open the app while holding option and command down to bring up the repair menu.  (I don't know the iphoto equivalent.) <comment19944> Oh - 1 and 2 have hit me on many occasions (but mostly when running beta OS or iTunes come to think of it). I added them first since they can be faster and have helped others often. I'm happy now!
