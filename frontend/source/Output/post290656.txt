How to force backup through Time Machine in terminal <body> I am trying to force strongTime Machine/strong to do backup with terminal, to backup one virtual machine while it is saved and stopped, but till now I am unable to do that,  precodetmutil startbackup --auto /code/pre  and then, to check if that backup has been made,  precodetmutil listbackup /code/pre  but there is no new entry in the list after.  <answer290665> After check Time Machine GUI I notice that it was working as expected, but it was tacking a while because after backup there was also a cleaning part. There is no need for higher privileges to use this command.  <comment366940> When I run 'tmutil listbackup' I get an 'unrecognized verb' message?  Can you help? <comment366941> I found problem. Should be listbackups   Need to make that plural.  Sorry
