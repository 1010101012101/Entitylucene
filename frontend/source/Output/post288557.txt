Why I'm getting "macOS can't repair the disk" <body> I'm using Macbook Pro Mid 2012 on Sierra. It has two partitions without OS partition. Four times those 2 partitions getting corrupted(can't copy files). And I tried to repair disk, And got this message  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lcgMh.png" alt="enter image description here"  After I restart my MBP got this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kzESk.png" alt="enter image description here"  So as they said I copied the data and reformat it to "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)". Again in 2 days one partition got corrupted. So then I realize File system was "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)" and now it shows only "Mac OS Extended".  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5kL18.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodeRashs-MacBook-Pro:~ rashmendis$ sudo gpt -r show disk0 Password:        start        size  index  contents            0           1         PMBR            1           1         Pri GPT header            2          32         Pri GPT table           34           6                    40      409600      1  GPT part - C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B       409640   781975184      2  GPT part - 53746F72-6167-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    782384824     1269536      3  GPT part - 426F6F74-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC    783654360   715947032      4  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1499601392      262144            1499863536   453399448      5  GPT part - 48465300-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC   1953262984      262151            1953525135          32         Sec GPT table   1953525167           1         Sec GPT header  Rashs-MacBook-Pro:~ rashmendis$ diskutil list /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:          Apple_CoreStorage MacOS                   400.4 GB   disk0s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk0s3    4:                  Apple_HFS Backup                  366.6 GB   disk0s4    5:                  Apple_HFS Data                    232.1 GB   disk0s5  /dev/disk1 (internal, virtual):    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:                            MacOS                  +400.0 GB   disk1                                  Logical Volume on disk0s2                                  6E77AA56-7B2E-4388-9640-F34D7E92164C                                  Unencrypted /code/pre  Issues having with codedisk0s4 and disk0s5/code.   strongI need to know is this a problem of my HDD drive or a issue with the OS./strong  <comment364417> Please give us more data as to how these got corrupted. Has there been any physical damage? <comment364422> No some times MBP stucked. And sometimes it stuck when Time Machine backup preparing Then I restart by pressing Power Button. Then it got corrupted. Again when Time Machine backuping I restarted. Those two are the known instances. <comment364511> hmmm this is pretty puzzling. Have you tried running first aid from recovery? <comment364513> Yes that also same <comment371047> Answer is here! https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/287973/242369
