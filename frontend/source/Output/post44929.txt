Restoring one system file from Time Machine backup <body> I have this file that I want to restore, that is a system file, normally stored on /tmp.  If I open Finder, and select GO  GO TO FOLDER  I type /tmp on the window and it opens /private/tmp  (???? why ?)  Anyway, the file is not there, but the file was there 5 days ago. I open time machine and it shows me an empty window If I go back in type, but if I type the name of the file on the finder search box, I see several versions of the file (one day ago, two days ago, etc.). I select one of them, but the RESTORE BUTTON is disabled. I right click on a file and select RESTORE TO, but nothing happens...  How do I select a system file from days ago from a time machine backup?  Yes, I am sure the file is there.  thanks.  <answer44936> because /tmp is a symbolic link to /private/tmp  aka /tmp does not really exist  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiWYU.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer44940> Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to recover that file using emTime Machine/em. There are a number of files and directories that Time Machine does not back up—primarily cache and temporary files. This includes the files in the code/tmp/code directory. The directory itself (minus contents) strongis/strong backed up, because it is necessary for a reinstall.  The complete list of exclusions can be found in code/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oBRqX.png" alt="image of StdExclusions.plist in Property List Editor"  ᔥ Devin Lane: Time Machine Exclusions  <comment51112> What is the full file name? <comment51141> It's worth noting that /tmp is specifically for *temporary* files.  There's a good reason it isn't backed up. <comment51187> I forgot that... thanks
