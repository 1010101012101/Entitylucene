Sort by Favorites in Photos 1.01 for Yosemite <body> I have Photos 1.01 in Yosemite and I can't sort by favorited photos.  I always used this to sort out the ones I want to share.  It seems that they removed all sorting capabilities except in order by date. I also like to sort in reverse by date to get most current at top. Did Apple remove these useful options? Why? Too simple is not useful Apple! Love you but bring back my sort options.
