Mac OS word delimiter character settings <body> I seem to remember seeing a tip once where there was a setting in System Preferences where you can define "programming" as a language or something so that double-clicking on a hyphenated word selects the entire word, hyphen and all.  I did this on my older MBP and now can't remember how to do it for my new one (10.9.1)  <answer236009> There's a setting that might be what you're referring to:  OS X Preferences  Language &amp; Region  Region  Americas  strongUnited States (Computer)/strong   <comment140687> what do you mean by define "programming" as a language or something <comment140689> there was a way to set in as a variant of English.  Unless I'm hallucinating... <comment140690> The only thing I can see that sounds like that is the Format language in language & region's Advance section <comment288701> We are looking for more than a short answer.
