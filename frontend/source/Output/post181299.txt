Fusion Drive seems to be messed up <body> I felt that my iMac late 2012 became pretty slow, above all after login. Now when I look into disk utility, it seems that my disk doesn't behave as Fusion Drive any more:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DNsw.png" alt="enter image description here"  An output from terminal:  precode➜  ~  diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *121.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Untitled                121.0 GB   disk0s2 /dev/disk1    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *3.0 TB     disk1    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk1s1    2:                  Apple_HFS Macintosh HD            3.0 TB     disk1s2    3:                 Apple_Boot Recovery HD             650.0 MB   disk1s3  ➜  ~  diskutil cs list No CoreStorage logical volume groups found /code/pre  How can I repair this?  <answer181435> To rebuild your Fusion Drive almost non-destructively you have to convert your main volume (the HDD) to a Core Storage Volume Group first, then add the SSD as a physical volume and expand the Logical Volume to the full size of the now expanded Volume Group. All data on the SSD (volume: Untitled) will be erased, so back it up.  ol liBackup your main volume and if necessary the volume "Untitled" on your SSD to an external backup drive./li liDetach the backup drive and all other external drives/li liBoot to Recovery Mode by entering kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd immediately after the boot chime./li liOpen Disk Utility and check all volumes and disks for errors and repair them.br strongemBut don't repair/rebuild the Fusion Drive without a backup, if you are asked to.

Though it was not intended in my answer to repair the Fusion drive this way. If you wouldn't have had a backup all your data would have been lost. To keep a general-purpose answer I added a warning and the possibility to repair the Fusion Drive in step 4 (instead of drives and volumes) and restore a backup. <comment216346> I know - the tool warns you twice that the data will be lost; but your first step is to make a backup, so I had a time machine backup and therefore I used that :) Thanks again! <comment308966> thank you for this answer Klanomath. Other guides I found didn't work unless you booted off a USB - and even then I had issue with El Capitan but this method still works.
