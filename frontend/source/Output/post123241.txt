How can I set a web server in a specific directory in OSX Mavericks? <body> I am running a web server in OSX Mavericks using the default directory location (code$HOME/Sites/code). How can I add sites from distinct arbitrary directories ?  I have found instructions about how to change the root folder of the apache server, but I do not want to override the default location (I have things there) but to add new folders.  <answer123247> This might be overkill, or answering a slightly different question than you asked, but if you have npm, you can   codenpm install http-server/code  and then just   codehttp-server/code  from the directory you want to host. http-server will reply with the path hosted and the port it is hosted on e.g.:  codeStarting up http-server, serving ./foo on port: 8080 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server/code   If you launch multiple instances it will increment the port.   <answer123395> The easy way (python):  precode$ cd some/dir $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer /code/pre  The slightly less easy way (apache):  Use apache virtual hosts. Here is a guide http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/set-virtual-hosts-apache-mac-osx-10-9-mavericks-osx-10-8-mountain-lion/. Basically, it allows you to point apache to multiple directories (they can be located anywhere).   It goes something like this:  precode$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/httpd.conf /code/pre  Uncomment this line  precodeInclude /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  Edit the vhosts  precode$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf /code/pre  There should be an example in the file, you can just edit that to fit your needs. Here is an example.  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;   ServerAdmin me@example.com   DocumentRoot "/Users/USER_NAME/Sites/test.com"   ServerName test.com   ErrorLog "/Users/USER_NAME/Sites/test.com/error.log"   CustomLog "/Users/USER_NAME/Sites/test.com/access.log" common &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  When you want to add another site, copy those lines and append them to the bottom of the file (changing the settings for your new site)  Lastly, edit your /etc/hosts file so you can access your new site.  precode$ sudo emacs /etc/hosts /code/pre  Add this line  precode127.0.0.1 local.test.com /code/pre  Restart apache for the changes to take effect.  precode$ sudo apachectl restart /code/pre  Since you said that you wanted to keep the default site, add an entry into the vhosts file that looks like this  precode&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;   ServerName localhost   DocumentRoot /Users/USER_NAME/Sites &lt;/VirtualHost&gt; /code/pre  Then restart apache.  <comment143908> I had not thought about using something else than Apache (already installed). Maybe I should give it a try to npm. Could you please expand a bit your answer ? How can I access the server at that location ? (I already have the apache server running in port 80). Is it easy to shutdown the server for the directory where I started ? <comment143910> yep. I added a bit. It tells you the port to use and how to shutdown. Just leave that terminal window open and you can quit it whenever you are ready. <comment144075> You will need to modify the /etc/apache2/http.conf file - <comment168529> You can install node (which includes npm) using homebrew, if desired, via "brew install node".
