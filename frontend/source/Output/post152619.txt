Terminal commands not found: <body> strongShort explanation./strong  After I've created .bash_profile file and added the line strongexport PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH/strong into it, my terminal stopped working properly. Could you please help me to fix the problem? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxT1C.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongLong explanation./strong All I wanted and still want is to install Scala. I followed this instruction:     Mac OS X If you use the homebrew package manager, simply type brew   update and then brew install sbt in a Terminal prompt.      Otherwise, install sbt by following these steps:      ul   liDownload sbt from here: http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.12.4/sbt.tgz/li   liUnpack the archive to a directory of your choice/li   liAdd the bin/ directory to the PATH environment variable. Open the file ~/.bash_profile in an editor (create it if it doesn't exist) and   add the following line export PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH/li   /ul      Verify that sbt is installed correctly: Open a new terminal (to apply   the changed .bash_profile) using the Terminal application in   /Applications/Utilities/ and type sbt -h, you should see a help   message from sbt.   First, I tried it with Homebrew and followed this instructions. It didn't work well, so I decided to go through the steps above. After I created the .bash_profile file and added the line strongexport PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH/strong (with the valid path, of course), terminal went crazy. Your help is more than welcome!   strongEDIT:/strong   Ina:sbt ps1$ echo $PATH  //Users/ps1/Documents/PS  <answer152623> If the path includes spaces, you're going to need to quote it.  Your line codeexport PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH/code causes Bash to interpret the codePATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS/code part as the full first argument to your PATH—telling codeexport/code to set the PATH to only the section before the space. If you use codeexport "PATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH"/code, it will interpret the entire codePATH=/Users/ps1/Documents/PS 1/whatever-else/:$PATH/code as part of the first argument. By convention, most people only quote the right side of the equals sign, because it looks nicer, it's the only thing that needs quoted, and bash automatically concatenates strings with no spaces between them.  <comment179628> Are you sure you don't have a typo somewhere? Can you run `echo $PATH` and paste the output of that. <comment179630> I get //Users/ps1/Documents/PS <comment179631> I don't have PS in Documents, only PS 1. <comment179632> Have you looked at: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66931/terminal-path-error <comment179642> I see.. I managed to open the .bash_profile file and added the quotation marks. Unfortunately, I still see the following message when I open the terminal:   Last login: Fri Oct 24 00:15:50 on ttys000 -bash: export: `“PATH=//Users/ps1/Documents/PS': not a valid identifier -bash: export: `1/sbt/bin:??': not a valid identifier <comment179644> echo $PATH prints now /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/X11/bin:/usr/texbin <comment179645> @Ina You have smart quotes. That does not work. You can just copy and paste from my post or use another editor like `nano` or `emacs`. <comment179646> You are right. The problem is solved. THANK YOU! Now I just have to figure out why the command sbt -h prints a wrong message out. <comment179647> This might be helpful for those who encounter the same problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18819124/how-to-run-bash-profile-in-mac-terminal
