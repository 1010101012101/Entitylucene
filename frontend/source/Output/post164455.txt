Save buffered video in Safari <body> Where does Safari 8 store buffered videos? I want to save a buffered video permanently to my drive for later viewing.  <comment192844> Video from what source? Buffers are, well, buffers, and the contents are continually flushed depending on the source and playback plugin. <comment192905> Video from a streaming website like YouTube. The video is on my computer. I can awaken the computer after sleep and the video is still there. I can skip within the video. Surely the video is on my machine and Safari knows where to look for it in order to play it. The video remains available until I close the tab. <comment192977> AFAIK, there's only a small cache file that is used for the buffer. The entire video is not downloaded and held in a cache buffer. There are some utilities that will download or capture YouTube videos but I have never tried any of them. <comment193035> I have experience with videos up to 60 minutes long from various sites that seem to be completely in memory. Once the video is fully buffered, I can skip arbitrarily and the video response is immediate. Skipping would not be so fluid if parts were being re-downloaded.
