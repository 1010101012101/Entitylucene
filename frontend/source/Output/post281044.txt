Automator action and workflow downloads page <body> I'm reading an AppleScript/Automator tutorial book from 2010, where it says (the emphasis is mine):     by going to strongwww.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/strong [...] you’ll find a growing list of Automator actions provided by other developers [...] You’ll find Automator workflows and actions for specific applications (such as Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and others), general workflows for specific tasks (adding Google Analytics code to your iWeb sites, for instance) and other handy tools that activate screen savers, convert text to different audio formats, and more.   (p. 72 of Myer, Thomas. emApple Automator with AppleScript Bible/em. Wiley, 2010)  The URL no longer works, and a Google search has not yielded an alternative URL. Where is the Automator action and workflow downloads page nowadays?
