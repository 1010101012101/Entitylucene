When in Fullscreen OSX Yosemite won't hide the dock <body> I dont have "auto hide" enable for dock. but in all previous version dock will hide if I enter in full screen mode for vlc player or for chrome. Now its no longer the case. If I enbale "auto hide" then its hide it but that's not what I am looking for as I like to see dock all the time except full screen mode.  <answer235038> When facing this kind of problem (it occurs for me especially when I'm playing), I usually kbd Cmd /kbd + kbd Tab /kbd to emswitch to another/em application, then emswitch back/em to my full-screened one through the same command. It does the trick and makes the Dock disappear.  <answer295241> Open Terminal and type:  precode$ killall Dock /code/pre  This will restart the process.   <comment201122> Does the dock not hide for just some  of your apps or all of them. I dod not have VLC on this Mac but all my app including Chrome hide the dock when in FS. <comment201416> None of the app. Even for chrome it doesn't hide. <comment201576> It works now after restart! thanks <comment348697> Same thing happens for me as well, it's irritating, and usually it's when I can't restart because I'm in a webex or goto meeting or doing something for work that needs to be done. <comment354547> I tried that. The Dock is still there. <comment372723> Huh? Some has down-voted this? Am I dealing with goblins? Or insecure teenage boys? <comment372724> Bit weird, seeing as the answer is actually correct.
