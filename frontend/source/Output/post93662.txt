Mirroring two displays with different screen sizes <body> I have an iMac 20" mid-2007 and an external 23.6" 16:9 aspect display, I would like to mirror displays keeping a 16:9 aspect on the external display, eventually stretching the image of the built-in 8:5 aspect display.  Is it possible?  Thanks  <answer94075> AFAIK Apple will not distort a display.  Instead it will preserve square pixels by letter-boxing or pillar-boxing one or both of the displays as necessary.   <answer94107> It is not possible. Apple explains well what happens when you mirror displays:  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5019?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US  "Your Mac will attempt to match the closest resolution between the primary (or built-in) and secondary displays. The usable resolution is the closest matching resolution for both primary and secondary display. If you choose a resolution that is not supported on both displays, the resolution will return to the closest matching resolution."  What are you doing that your only choice is to mirror the displays?
