Mail freezes with initial migration after upgrading to Mountain Lion <body> I recently upgraded Mac os 10.5.6 to the new 10.8.1 (Mountain Lion).  So far, everything seems to work fine except Mail.app.  When I open the application for the first time, it begins migrating and then freezes. How can I solve this?  <answer63206> Try deleting the three files which name start with emEnvelope/em, in strong~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/strong .  <comment72871> FYI) My old OS was 10.6.8... <comment72986> So, its 10.5.6 or 10.6.8? <comment116230> This is a common problem. The directories you need to delete are cache files and it is safe to delete them. However, if I recall, they are in hidden directories, so you need to know how to enable invisible directories and files in the Finder to find them and delete them.
