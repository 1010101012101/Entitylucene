Should I use homebrew or the official downloader to install nodejs? <body> I recently bought a mac, and I need to know what the difference between installing nodejs (or any application for that matter) through homebrew and official downloader is? What's the recommended method?  <answer254105> No problem with .pkg installer downloaded from official website. Seems to be the same with brew. Don't forget to update Homebrew.
