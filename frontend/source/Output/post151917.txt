coreaudiod and launchd are taking up 80% and 40% processor respectively <body> I've just upgraded from mavericks to yosemite, the download was sluggish but eventually worked so I don't think any of the files were corrupted. There was no hitch with the installation as far as I know either. All I know is that when I woke up after leaving my MacBook Pro (15 inch, mid-2010) its fan was spinning out of control at the login screen.  When I restarted and looked at the activity monitor I saw that core audio and launchd were the culprits. I've tried the following to fix my problem:  ul liClearing the PRAM./li liClearing the SMC./li liDeleting the plist for the audio preference pane./li liVerifying disk permissions./li liRepairing disk permissions./li /ul  Additional info: I've run etreCheck a few times and have fixed most of the things it pointed out, all that is left is:  System launch daemons with problems :     [fail]  com.apple.systemstatsd.plist  Launch daemons with problems :     [invalid?]  com.adobe.SwitchBoard.plist Aide  I've searched and haven't found any answers that worked yet. Anything else I can do apart from a reinstall?  Also I've noticed that bluetooth can't be turned off anymore although it doesn't actually seem to be on, any fixes for that would be appreciated too.  <answer161379> Just had the exact same issue after restarting. I had previously unloaded a bunch of services.  The bluetooth issue was due to unloading the bluetooth service, but I had a bluetooth mouse plugged in via USB, I guess there was some override in the IO or something.   Loading the service again fixed the issue.     sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.blued.plist   The core audio issue seems to have been fixed by loading the video assistant again     sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.cmio.IIDCVideoAssistant.plist   Hope this helps someone as there shouldn't be the need for a full system restore because of one or two service issues.  <comment178741> since as you say there were many install hick-ups how about cmd-r to restore it. <comment223729> This solved it for me, greatly appreciated!
