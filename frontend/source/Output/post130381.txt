Which application/command catches a keyboard shortcut? <body> Is there a way to find out which application or command catches a global hotkey in osx?  <comment152823> I doubt you can catch this, as the application which consumes the key listens to that specific command and does not log back to OSX it has used it. <comment325651> Possible duplicate of [How do I determine which application handles a global shortcut?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64086/how-do-i-determine-which-application-handles-a-global-shortcut)
