Detect fn and function key simultaneously pressed <body> I am using ControllerMate to try to change what my volume buttons do.  Unfortunately, I haven't figured out how I can detect that the kbdF11/kbd or kbdF12/kbd keys are being pressed at the same time as the kbdfn/kbd key.  Originally I'd planned to combine an kbdF11/kbd keypress detector and an AppleScript that checks for the kbdfn/kbd key.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rs768.png" alt="enter image description here"  I haven't been able to find a way in AppleScript to detect the kbdfn/kbd key. Research led me to possible solutions, such as  precodedo shell script "/usr/bin/python -c 'import Cocoa; print Cocoa.NSEvent.modifierFlags()'" /code/pre  But this can't distinguish between the different function keys or kbdfn/kbd.  After almost a week trying to figure this out myself I ask you; is there a way to detect in ControllerMate a simultaneous kbdfn/kbd and function key press?  <comment373627> If I remember correctly, Fn is *not* a typical modifier key - it's not captured by the OS; it's "local" to the keyboard so to speak.  As such, there's nothing to capture.  One way to test, is to "sniff" the packets - look at this program on [GitHub](https://github.com/objective-see/sniffMK).  Try running it and pressing the Fn key.  If it's not recognized, then you can't capture it with anything. <comment373628> @allan karabiner elements manages to do it, so it must be possible somehow. I'll have a look over that link.
