I can't get calendar.app from the app store. <body> I can't download / get calendar app from the app store. I just updated to iOS10 and when I finished I noticed that something was missing in my home screen. I took me a while to realize that I lost my calendar app.   When I tried to get it from the app store I just couldn't. I can push the "get" button that transform into a install button. When I tried to push install I just can't. I can get any other apps from the app store. Buy or just get it.   Is this a normal behavior?   Thanks!   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4KYC1.png" alt="app store screenshot"  <answer254763> Try to restart your device whit:  ul liOn an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus: Press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons for at least ten seconds, until you see the Apple logo./li liOn an iPhone 6s and earlier, iPad, or iPod touch: Press and hold both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons for at least ten seconds, until you see the Apple logo./li /ul  If the problem persists, make sure you make all system updates.  Try an alternative to load a Backup of your device from iTunes to restore the calendar App.  <comment317199> I've already restarted several times. I've noticed that the data for calendar and reminders are still in the phone. Perhaps I'll try restore the iPhone from backup <comment317201> @Ipuerto - ok let me know if it works. <comment317223> returned after I restore the iPhone.... it was a bad installation. Walled was also missing.
