How to move individual apps & files from old to new macbook pro <body> I have an old 09 macbookpro running 10.8.6, &amp; have just bought a refurbed mid-2012 one running 10.11.5. I want to transfer some of my old files &amp; apps from old to new, but not all of them. I'm looking for a simple way to do this; I'm not a techie, just an end user.  <answer242072> ul liTurn off the 10.8.6 computer./li liConnect it to the new computer with either a Firewire or Thunderbolt cable./li liHold T down on the 10.8.6 computer.This will boot it into  Target Disk Mode /li liThe 10.8.6 computer's disk should now be mounted on the new computer. You can transfer just the files that you want and then unmount the older computer./li /ul  Transferring the files with a USB flash drive would work as well.  <comment297010> Can you try the application preinsralled on your new Mac called Migration assistant? <comment297243> Migration Assistant transfers everything.  I want to move files & apps selectively. <comment297245> I've been told I don't want to use Migration Asst because I won't be able to move files & Apps selectively. <comment297259> I strongly recommend you try it. Near the bottom of this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350 it shows you being able to choose which data gets copied. <comment297595> OP probably doesn't have a firewire or thunderbolt cable, which is why I was going to say to use a flash drive, but you mentioned that for me. Good advice right here.
