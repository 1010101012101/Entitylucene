Can't figure out what is taking up so much space <body> When I codecd /; du sudo du -h -d1/code I get a total of about 160 GB (this is on a 256 GB drive). However, when I look at Disk Utility or About this Mac - More Info - Storage it looks like I'm using a solid 230 GB.  This is on a late 2013 Macbook Pro Retina, OS X 10.9.2.  I suspect the problem may be with mobile backups (I'm not hooked up to an external hard disk for backups).  I've tried, several times, running codesudo tmutil disablelocal/code but that doesn't appear to fix the problem.  Here is the output of codedf -h/code after disabling local backups  code/dev/disk1      233G  212G   21G  92% //code  After re-enabling:  code/dev/disk1                         233G  212G   21G  92% / localhost:/ebh4eOBPvo122KL1TUyqlO  233G  233G     0 100% /Volumes/MobileBackups/code  Output of codels -l /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/MyComputerName/code  codetotal 1 drwxr-xr-x 3 root wheel 102 Jul 16 17:55 2014-07-16-175518 lrwxrwxrwx 0 root wheel   0 Jul 16 17:55 Latest -&gt; 2014-07-16-175518/code  Output of codesudo tmutil delete 2014-07-16-175518/code  codeDeleting: /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/MyComputerName/2014-07-16-175518 Error (-36) deleting: /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/MyComputerName/2014-07-16-175518 Error (642) re-linking Latest for machine directory: /Volumes/MobileBackups/Backups.backupdb/MyComputerName Total deleted: 237.4K/code  Any ideas?  I know very little about Macs, if that's not obvious.    <answer139123> To try and locate which files and directories are consuming the most disk space on your Mac, I'd recommend running OmniDiskSweeper. You can run it off of the DMG just fine. Select your hard drive and let it run and it'll list in descending order where the greatest disk usage is.  OmniDiskSweeper: https://www.omnigroup.com/download/latest/OmniDiskSweeper  From there you should hopefully be able to free up some space.  Hope this helps you!
