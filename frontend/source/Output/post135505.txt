Disable swapfile encryption on Maverics <body> does anyone know how to disable the default encryption of the swap file ?  i tried this by setting the default preferences   precode$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.virtualMemory DisableEncryptedSwap -boolean yes /code/pre  but this doesn't work :(  precode$ sysctl vm.swapusage vm.swapusage: total = 1024.00M  used = 0.00M  free = 1024.00M  (encrypted) /code/pre  any ideas ?  <answer135526> OS X Mavericks uses dynamic_pager to manage the swap file. The key name is codeUseEncryptedSwap/code not DisableEncryptedSwap.  So try  precode$ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.virtualMemory UseEncryptedSwap -boolean NO /code/pre  <answer180093> As you can see in dynamic_pager.c (source code of dynamic_pager) the key is called strongDisableEncryptedSwap/strong and has to be located inside strong/Library/Preferences/com.apple.virtualMemory.plist/strong.  I tried this with 10.9.5:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.virtualMemory DisableEncryptedSwap -boolean YES /code/pre  After reboot codesysctl vm.swapusage/code shows no longer any encryption.  <comment160627> nop... swap file is still encrypted after boot. i guess there must be an new key or preset somewhere else <comment217059> Unfortunately today (still at 10.9.5 and with all Security patches applied) this tip doesn't work. After reboot, `sysctl vm.swapusage` still shows "(encrypted)" even after deleting **/var/vm/swapfile** prior to rebooting... Please can you confirm on your Mac and revert to us?
