How can I "go to page" in preview via toolbar? <body> I would like to select the page directly from the window, but it is not accessible :img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4gT6I.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer104672> Control click on the toolbar and add the page control field.  It looks blank and has page for the help text in english.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1820I.png" alt="Page control in the toolbar for Preview"  Then you can type whatever page you wish directly into the toolbar without needing to use the Command-Option-G keyboard shortcut to go to a specific page.
