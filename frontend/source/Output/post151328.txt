Restoring a Time Machine backup on Yosemite's clean install <body> If I want to perform a clean install of OS X Yosemite, can I restore my Mac with a Mavericks Time Machine backup after the Yosemite installer finishes?  <answer151350> Restoring an entire Time Machine backup is certainly possible after cleanly installing Yosemite. Just boot to the Recovery HD and choose restore from backup.  <comment178030> Sorry if this might be a duplicate question, but I was unable to find something that answered this particular question. <comment178045> Do you want to restore the OS or just your data? <comment178046> Just the data and my preferences if possible. <comment178047> There should be no problem doing that. <comment178048> Thanks. I just wanted to make sure I don't run into some message of sorts saying hey this time machine back up is from Mavericks and you can't restore it on Yosemite or something... <comment178049> One would assume Apple has considered that the 10.9 and 10.10 are compatible :) <comment183044> Can you select a speceific time to restore to? <comment192053> I just completed a clean install of OS X Yosemite and plugged in my usb backup drive that had my system backed up from Mavericks. I can see the mounted disk on the desktop and can browse the files, but when trying to restore from the disk it says that no complete backup could be found. I did some searching and it looks like others are having a similar problem. Looks like I may have to manually fish out my files (music, photos, et cetera) from the drive instead of a 'one push button' approach.
