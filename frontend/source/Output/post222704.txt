How to increment the font size of the Xcode UI? <body> I googled and saw only how to increment the editor font size (code size).  But how do I enlarge the UI font size?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wdeW8.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer222755> I believe it is system-wide question, rather then Xcode one. What IS under Xcode control is editor fontsize.  But what you are asking is to change system fonts that are being used for Xcode main menu, files treeView, etc.  AFAIK - zoom under accessibility is only available option in this case. "Apple main menu"  "System Preferences..."  "Accessibility"  "Zoom"   <answer286034> https://www.tekrevue.com/tip/hidpi-mode-os-x/  It took me a while to find this but I didn't give up because I felt my eyes were being strained too much!  How to Enable HiDPI Mode in Mac OS X  ul licopy this into terminal /li lisudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true/li liNext, reboot your Mac and, upon logging back in, head to System Preferences  Displays./li /ul  Here, you’ll see the familiar preference window where you can set your resolution and refresh rate. Most users will likely have the “Default for Display” option checked, which is typically your display’s native resolution. Click Scaled to reveal additional resolutions and you’ll see one or more options at the bottom of the list with “(HiDPI)” appended to their resolutions. Click on one of the HiDPI modes to enable it on your desired display.  Note: If you’re not seeing the HiDPI resolutions listed in System Preferences after using the Terminal command above, try clicking on the “Scaled” radio button while holding the Alt/Option key on your keyboard. This trick reveals additional resolutions for all displays, and should list the HiDPI resolutions if they weren’t already visible.  <answer286044> you can change your screen resolution to a lower value.  You lose screen real estate but fonts get larger.  <comment318266> http://stackoverflow.com/a/18930077/6557621 <comment320391> @MCCCS No, that is about how to change the editor font size, not the UI such as the project navigator or other parts of the Xcode. I think Apple really is unthoughtful in font size. Not only Xcode, other applications such as the App Store do not have font size settings, making it really difficult to read app reviews in tiny fonts. <comment320392> This is frustrating. Other famous IDE's such as Microsoft's Visual Studio or Google's Android Studio all provide far more UI customisation. I can increase the UI font size, change layout, etc. With Xcode, it is just 'take it or leave it'. <comment357668> Unfortunately, as I observed all these years, Apple despises developers and they give us the minimum they can. They sell excellency to their customers and give us crappy tools and documentations. Think about the time you probably fight the documentation and Xcode. <comment360839> Welcome to Ask Different!
