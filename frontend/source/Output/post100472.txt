Creating screenshots of iOS devices from OSX without Xcode <body> Is there a way to create screenshots of iOS devices from OSX without using Xcode? I am looking for a fast way to do that.  I know 2 methods:  ol liUsing Xcode/li liTaking a screenshot on the device and sharing it using message/mail whatever/li /ol  but both these methods are cumbersome and slow. I want to be able to create those screenhots fast.  Any suggestions?   <answer100506> You could use airplay mirroring to an Apple TV or your Mac and take screenshots from those output displays  Edit: Also, just enable photo stream on iPhoto and your phone and it'll automatically upload any screenshots you take with the power and home buttons. I can't think of a faster method than that  <answer100559> The quickest way that i've found is just using the iOS Simulator and then kbdCommand âŒ˜/kbd+kbdS/kbd, which takes screenshots really quickly.   If you don't want to open Xcode to open the iOS Simulator, here's a useful answer telling you how to open the iOS Simulator directly or create a shortcut (or even from Terminal): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10379622/how-to-run-iphone-emulator-without-starting-xcode  <comment118279> I wouldn't consider the standard method (#2) to be slow per se, so I wonder a bit which problem you are trying to solve here. Why do these screenshots need to be fast? Someone may find better ways here if you share some context. <comment118280> You won't get much faster than method #2 (home + power button takes  1 sec.), so I'm with Patrix on this one. What needs to be fast about your process?
