iPhone/iMessage question <body> If I lost my iPhone and suspended the number but iMessage from my laptop, do the iMessages I send from the laptop continue to be sent to my phone?   The people I iMessage are getting the messages as my number--which I suspended. I'm confused because I don't want someone to find my iPhone and have all of my messages and information along with my apple ID.  I have not tried to contact Apple yet but that will be my next step.  <answer154438> iMessage is connected with your iCloud E-Mail-Address as well. So if somebody unlocks your iPhone, this person will see all of your messages.  This Apple Support document describes the ways necessary to stop iMessage on your lost phone:     strongIf you didn't turn off or deactivate iMessage before switching to a   non-Apple phone, other iOS devices will still try to use iMessage/strong to   send text messages to your phone number.      If you still have your iPhone, follow these steps to turn off iMessage   and deregister your phone number:      ol   liIf you transferred your SIM card from the iPhone to a non-Apple   phone, put it back in the iPhone./li   liMake sure that you're connected to the cellular data network. /li   liTap Settings  Messages and turn iMessage off./li   /ol      If you don't have access to your iPhone, or if you can't deactivate   iMessage from your iPhone, please contact Apple Support.
