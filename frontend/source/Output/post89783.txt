how to thin out adobe CS 5.5 <body> I wan't to get rid of unnecessary files on my SSD HD.  Although I only checked Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat and Photoshop (and something iOs-related) while installing, Adobe has still installed a bunch of other folders/applications. Which of the following folders can I safely delete?  ol liAdobe/li liAdobe After Effects CS5.5/li liAdobe Bridge CS5.1/li liAdobe Device Central CS5.5/li liAdobe Extension Manager CS5.5/li liAdobe Flash Builder 4.5/li liAdobe Flash CS5.5/li liAdobe Media Encoder CS5.5/li liAdobe OnLocation CS5.1/li /ol  <answer89802> You could follow the instructions on this page at Adobe and uninstall the CS5 packages you don't need.  If you want to get rid of emeven more/em useless space, you could try Monolingual, which removes unneeded language resources.  <comment105467> Practically, I've not had good luck taking away parts that the system things is installed when update time arrives. Are you open to uninstalling everything and re-running the installer to just install the pieces you feel you need? <comment105498> Thanks, but I already tried Adobes uninstaller, and it leaves things unclear. It only shows me the applications I intentionally installed. It doesn't give me an option to get rid of applications like Bridge and so on. (there's almost 2Gb of folders I don't know why to keep)  Monolingual was a great tip, it saved me 1,8 Gb! <comment105502> I only chose to install Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat and Photoshop (and something iOs-related). Those other folders are automatically installed as well. I don't want to mess things up, i just want to know whether I can safely delete parts, and which. <comment105513> Those would be great details to edit into the question. Perhaps the installer isn't clear about how to selectively install parts of the suite.
