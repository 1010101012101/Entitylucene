Enable SSH access for AD admin accounts <body> I have the need to configure SSH access for a AD service account on a fleet of Macs. I can't make the account a local account as the password for the service account cycles often. The end goal is to allow all accounts in a restricted AD security group ssh access to our Macs, but I'd like to start with just a single AD account.   Any ideas? Thank you!  <answer86988> Within System Preferences - Sharing, the Remote Login option should have a spot for "Only these users".  If you've properly joined the machine to the domain (good luck), you should be able to select the group from the "+" sign.  <answer96227> Point taken via strongGUI/strong for AD security groups, but in the case where you also have a common local admin account on every Mac--and you hide user via UID &lt; 500, the GUI does not see such accounts, hence you cannot add the accounts to ssh restriction.  That's the whole point of hiding via lower UID: hide accounts from GUI.  You might be able to add local admin accounts to ssh restriction PRIOR to running the command below...  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow Hide500Users -bool YES /code/pre  ...then run the command above after excluding/confirming via GUI? Pretty sure the codedscl/code method allows you to exclude the account--regardless of hiding 500 users, but you can't confirm via GUI; only via CLI.    Again, working as designed, but might not be obvious at-a-glance.  <comment101923> Great suggestion. I live in terminal so much I forget to check the GUI every now and again. <comment101927> you can add AD groups to access_ssh by adding the group GUID to the NestedGroups dictionary:  dscl . create /Groups/com.apple.access_ssh NestedGroups [GUID]  restart SSH and your good to go:  launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
