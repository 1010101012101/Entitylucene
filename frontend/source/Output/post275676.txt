Notification widgets in Sierra not working at all <body> I have found out that my notification widgets don't show any content (No playback controls, no calendar entries etc.). I tried to restart my machine, kill notification center and start again, remove and add widgets back and also reset notification widgets. My privacy settings should be OK. But this is all I get:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DBNLd.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongEDIT/strong  I tried to disable and enable SIP as well as to remove the notificationcontrolui from LaunchAgents - but it's not working.  However, the Today and Tomorrow section refreshes.  <answer278131> It seems that I have found a solution which worked for me (Mac OS Sierra):  ol liReboot in Recovery Mode by holding down "Command + R"/li liDisable SIP by going to Utilities - Terminal and executing the following command: "csrutil disable"./li liReboot check the notification center. Everything should work now./li liReboot in Recover mode again by holding down "Command + R"/li liEnable SIP by going to Utilities - Terminal and executing the following command: "csrutil enable"./li liReboot and check notification center again. /li /ol  Hope this helps  <comment346819> I often have Notification widgets stop working every few weeks and I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it.
