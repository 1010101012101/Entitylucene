How to disable background blur effect on macOS Sierra login screen <body> I've replaced /Library/Desktop Pictures/Sierra.jpg with a custom background image. Now, macOS Sierra applies the blur effect on my custom background image as well. I am looking for a reliable solution to turn it off e.g. overwriting a plist preference file or any non-hacking workaround?  How can I completely disable the login screen background blur and show a crystal clear login image?  <answer261147> Do this:  ol liGo to /Library/Caches/ /li liRename the original com.apple.desktop.admin.png file to com.apple.desktop.admin1.png /li liAdd a new image in its place with the original emcom.apple.desktop.admin.png/em name /li /ol  This will replace the blurred original image with the new one unblurred.  <answer261156> Turn on "Reduce Transparency" in Accessibility and it will remove the blur effect.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACT3Q.png" alt="enter image description here"  This used to be called "Translucency" before, but for some reason they changed it to "Transparency".  I just tested it and my blurred login screen went to a simple grey screen.  <answer261162> i've found this somewhere :  The file in /System/Library/CoreServices/DefaultDesktop.jpg is an alias that points to /Library/Desktop Pictures/Sierra.jpg.  so i changed the picture called "Sierra.jpg" by mine &amp; i get this picture in login window. but it still blur effect.  i do not know how to remove it !  another page here, but i can not understand anything ! https://onemoreadmin.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/apples-efi-logonui-managing-macos-sierras-wallpaper/  <comment327010> yeah, this workflow applies to El Capitan and Yosemite. It doesn't work with macOS Sierra. I've replaced /Library/Caches/com.apple.desktop.admin.png. As soon as restart or logout the image is still blurred. <comment327012> Did you rename the original file and then add a new one? Or did you just replace the original? <comment327013> a) I have renamed com.apple.desktop.admin.png to com.apple.desktop.admin1.png. b) Than I copied my custom image and replace it with com.apple.desktop.admin.png. c) Logout + System reboot <comment327038> Unfortunately "Reduce Transparency" doesn't remove the blurred background image. The Background image with our company logo is still blurred. With solid plain color backgrounds you might not see any difference. <comment327040> I don't any have solid color backgrounds... I will look a bit more into it. <comment327043> Making modifications to the System folder is not recommended! As I mentioned above, replacing the desktop image is working just fine. however I would like to disable the background blur. <comment327134> That's interesting. I know these steps worked in macOS Sierra. I wonder if the actual image itself has an effect somehow? When I get a chance I will try a few different ones and test the results. <comment327197> same for me,, i've just mentioned this because it could be a way of investigation... <comment327198> if anybody could help further,, thankxx
