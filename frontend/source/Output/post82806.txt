How to cleanly remove MacPorts <body> I'd like to cleanly remove all changes made by MacPorts as well as MacPorts itself, to try my luck with homebrew. How can I do that?  <answer82810> The MacPort documentation advises to use your Terminal and type:br codesudo port -fp uninstall installed/code  and with this command, all remaining items will be deleted:  precodesudo rm -rf /opt/local sudo rm -rf /Applications/DarwinPorts sudo rm -rf /Applications/MacPorts sudo rm -rf /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg sudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg sudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 sudo rm -rf /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 sudo rm -rf ~/.macports /code/pre  strongWarning/strong: Don't run a codesudo/code command, especially a coderm -rf/code one, unless you know what it's doing.  <comment95695> Just make absolutely sure the first line ends in a *backslash* and not a forward slash! <comment95705> True that. I'll add it in my answer. <comment145584> I got this error `Error: No ports matched the given expression` when used `sudo port -fp uninstall installed`. What might be the possible reason? <comment280217> thnaks for the answer, what I was looking for, I got from here. Great!!! <comment356431> Is `/opt/local` used for anything besides MacPorts? If so, this seems dangerous....
