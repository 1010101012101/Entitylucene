How to drawn power from a lightning connector? <body> I'm working on an iPhone accessory that needs to grab power from a lightning connector.  Something like the lightning-to-USB cable, but I'd like to do that on a DIY way :)  The problem is that, connecting the lightning-USB cable I can get up to 150mA, and I need more :O Any way to grab more than 150mA? Is it an hard limit?  I'm mainly an iOS developer, so do you know if there's some function/library/framework that can help manage outgoing current? Or is this a private thing - or even worse, managed only by the OS.
