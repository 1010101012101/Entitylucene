"Advanced" App Store search <body> I would like to search the iPhone app store in such a way that I only see results that emdon't/em offer an in-app purchase. I know that Apple offers a data feed of all the App Store's data, so in principle a service could exist that would allow this. However, having tried all the App Store search engines I know of (uQurey, AppShopper, AppAdvice, 148apps), it seems that none of them offer this kind of specific customised search.  So my question is whether there is an App Store search service that allows such specific queries as this.  <answer120302> In short: No, there's currently no query for that. At least, none of them are published. I doubt Apple want to display those without in-App purchases, as they make them money when people buy it.  I seriously hope someone will proof me wrong in the nearby-future, but currently there's no option available for this. I've been searching around for a while for those filter-criteria.  <answer215409> There is a way now: https://appapp.io/us/has_iap=false/search  (Full disclosure - I made it)  <comment140413> You're probably right. (I'll leave the question open though, just in case.) I'm not sure it really is in Apple's interests, though. If the problem of apps (and games in particular) that appear free/cheap but actually aren't gets too bad, I'll just buy my way out of the iOS ecosystem, and eventually I'm sure others will too. But I guess that's Apple's choice to make... <comment146524> Please consider accepting the answer, if it helped you out. I'm sorry there's no better solution. <comment146534> @Rob I upvoted it, but my experience on Stack Exchange is that accepting an answer tends to discourage further answers, so I prefer to keep it open. It may be that there's no currently published query for this purpose now, but in the future there might be, and if someone posts an answer about it I'll accept that one.
