How to render only first page in PDF as image and then resize? <body> I've really stuck on how to do this, I thought it would be easy, but maybe not!  I want to create a small thumbnail image from the first page of a pdf in automator so I can batch convert a load of them at once. Is that possible? If so, what actions do I need to set up?  <answer69328> The following Automator workflow creates thumbnails for every page:  ol listrongGet Specified Finder Items/strong/li listrongRender PDF Pages as Images/strong/li listrongScale Images/strong/li listrongMove Finder Items/strong/li /ol  With the thumbnails created, you can then delete all but the first page images. You may be able to automate this step as well; consider adding a strongFilter Finder Items/strong Action before the strongMove Finder Items/strong.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2taLh.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer69761> Since there is no way to extract a single page from a PDF in Automator, you can try with this Python script. It will extract the first page of each passed pdf in a temporary pdf file:  precode#! /usr/bin/python # import sys import os import tempfile from Quartz.CoreGraphics import * from os.path import splitext from os.path import basename from os.path import join   def createPDFDocumentWithPath(path):     return CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, path, len(path), False))  def main(argv):      for input_pdf_filename in argv:         doc = createPDFDocumentWithPath(input_pdf_filename)         page_one = CGPDFDocumentGetPage(doc, 1)         mediaBox = CGPDFPageGetBoxRect(page_one, kCGPDFMediaBox)         if CGRectIsEmpty(mediaBox):             mediaBox = None          file_name, extension = splitext(basename(input_pdf_filename))         output_path = join(tempfile.gettempdir(), file_name + "_page1" + extension)         writeContext = CGPDFContextCreateWithURL(CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation(kCFAllocatorDefault, output_path, len(output_path), False), None, None)         CGContextBeginPage(writeContext, mediaBox)         CGContextDrawPDFPage(writeContext, page_one)         CGContextEndPage(writeContext)         CGPDFContextClose(writeContext)         del writeContext          print output_path   if __name__ == "__main__":     main(sys.argv[1:]) /code/pre  You can put it as a codeRun Shell Script/code step in an Automator workflow, similar to what @Graham Miln suggested:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnYZQ.png" alt="enter image description here"  Be sure to set codePass Input/code to codeas arguments/code, not to codeto stdin/code in the codeRun Shell Script/code step.  <comment81034> That is so incredibly inspired - thanks for taking the time to do that, works absolutely perfectly! <comment81035> Thanks Graham, this looks like a good option too.
