How to keep 2 Macs in sync completely <body> I got 2 Macs at home, one for main usage and one for project-working at school.  Is it possible to keep 2 Macs in sync completely? (Wirelessly) For example: Documents and Data, Applications, Movies, Music and other stuff that is on my home folder.  Can I do it through Terminal or other apps?  Thanks!  <comment157770> Thanks! Sorry for the duplicate, i've read that post before creating this post, i've heard something like rsync, which is built right into OS X. Can someone explain how that works? Thanks! <comment157773> That'd definitely be worth editing this question to be specific to rsync, with details about exactly how you'd like the sync to happen (e.g. when you modify each file or when you log out).
