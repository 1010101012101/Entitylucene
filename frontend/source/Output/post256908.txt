What is CalNCService and why does it run hot in macOS Sierra? <body> Since the upgrade to macOS Sierra I occasionally see a service CalNCService running hot (i.e. on 100% CPU).  So going from the name, this seems to be some Calendar Service. I tried disabling Calendars in Internet Accounts Preferences, but this was no help.  One can kill the service or restart the computer, but the problem persists.  Usually, after a few hours or so it goes back to normal.  What is this daemon doing? How can I debug this issue?  Update: In the log console I find this when calNCService starts up:  precodewarning: dynamic accessors failed to find @property implementation for 'serialNumber' for entity ABCDAddressBookSource while resolving selector 'serialNumber' on class 'ABCDAddressBookSource'.  Did you remember to declare it @dynamic or @synthesized in the @implementation ? /code/pre  Update2: The Service is connected to syncing reminders.  Disabling reminder sync under Internet Accounts makes the service go back to normal, enabling it again makes it go back to 100%.  This seems independent of the server. I have a bunch of recurring reminders and first had this problem with my account on fruux.com. Then I migrated all to iCloud and now its the same there.  Update3: Still very present in 10.12.1. and no reply on Apple Support Communities.  Update4: Another morning, another calNCService.  I have also manually checked the exported .ics of the offending reminder list.  It looks totally harmless.  About 40 Reminders with nothing special in them. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dq1et.png" alt="calNCService after some uptime"  Update 5: Still all the same in 10.12.2  Update 6: Confirmed in 10.12.4. Iterating: This seems to be some housekeeping task. When I activated the reminders after the upgrade the problem was not triggered for more than 24h. But now it is back. As before, it can be simply stopped by deactivating reminder sync under "Internet Accounts"  <answer277091> I had same problem (fans at full throttle, CalNCService at 122% of CPU) and have made 2 visits to Apple store and 3rd visit I checked in the Mac for a warranty repair (replaced both fans)...  Yet the problem continues.  I went into notifications  edit and disabled all notifications, badges, sounds, etc, except for iMessage, Slack and Outlook.    About 3 minutes later, I noticed.... silence.  Fans are normal.  I'll watch it for a while, but it seems this issue is definitely related to something in notifications.  I won't miss being pinged all day long.   <answer283929> I had this problem as well. I tried the above suggestions without success. Here's what finally worked for me:  ol liOpen codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet Accounts/code  /li liSelect the iCloud account and uncheck codeCalendar &amp; Reminders/code  /li liSelect any Google accounts that you have and remove them (Click the "-" button, bottom left)  /li liRestart the computer  /li liOpen codeSystem Preferences &gt; Internet Accounts/code and re-enable codeCalendar &amp; Reminders for iCloud/code /li liAdd your Google accounts/li /ol  Hope this works for you too!  <answer285626> I had to also ditch preferences &amp; related files.  There's an article that walked me through this, and my computer is quiet &amp; cool-to-the-touch for the first time in weeks. Looks by the blog date like this predates Sierra:   https://robert.accettura.com/blog/2012/08/19/how-to-stop-calendaragent-from-eating-cpu/   <answer294267> Definitely works, even before restarting:     On your own risk! Do a Time Machine backup first.      Open codeSystem Preferences/code, codeInternet accounts/code and untick codeCalendar/code for each account.      Open codeActivity Monitor/code, search codecalendar/code and quit calendar processes.      Open codeFinder/code  codeGo to Folder/code  (⇧⌘G) code/Library/Caches/code and drag contents to trash.      Open codeFinder/code  codeGo to Folder/code code~/Library/Caches/code and drag contents to trash.      Again, open codeFinder/code  codeGo to Folder/code code~/Library/Caches/code and drag contents to trash.      Open codeFinder/code  codeGo to Folder/code code~/Library/Containers/code select codecom.apple.CalendarAgent/code, codecom.apple.CalendarAgent.CalNCService/code, codecom.apple.CalendarFileHandler/code and codecom.apple.CalendarNotification.CalNCService/code and drag to trash.      Open codeFinder/code  codeGo to Folder/code code~/Library/Calendars/code and drag contents of the folder to trash.      Restart your computer.      Empty trash.      Open codeSystem Preferences/code, codeInternet accounts/code and tick codeCalendar/code for each account.      Open codeCalendar/code and wait for Calendars to sync.      Affected OS: macOS Sierra 10.12      Unconfirmed affected OS: Mac OS Yosemite 10.10 and El Capitan 10.11     From: https://support.itsolver.net/hc/en-au/articles/214098206-macOS-Sierra-CalNCService-high-CPU-usage  <comment321698> Do you have any other apps that have access to Reminders? Check under System Preferences  Security & Privacy  Reminders. If so could you tell me which? Unchecking those might also stop the 100% CPU problem. <comment321814> @iMaddin Yes, launchbar and fantastical2. I tried disabling fantastical2 in the beginning when the problem occurred. That is unrelated. I also think that it has its own sync mechanism, as it needs the passwords separately from "Internet Accounts". Launchbar does no sync really. It reads and writes to the task lists, though. <comment321822> But since Launchbar does write & read, it should cause Reminders to sync to the server when there are changes. Could you perhaps try disabling all apps from accessing reminders the next time this problem occurs? I'd really like to know if that changes anything. <comment321875> The process is currently running hot and I disabled both (including quitting the applications) - No change, still running hot. <comment321900> I had someone report that disabling apps from accessing Reminders while leaving sync on under Internet Accounts fixed the exact same issue you described. Very strange. <comment321974> Whenever you see “NC” in the name of the service, this refers to the **Notification Center** part of it. Does this problem go away if you **remove Calendar and/or Reminders from the Notification Center**? In the past, any issues I’ve experienced with Reminders in the Notification Center were resolved by deleting all my **Completed** reminders (several thousand of them). <comment322074> @Phong Oh. This is very helpful information. I'm trying it out. Although clearing my about 3600 done reminders did *not* help with this issue.  I've tried that. <comment322076> @Phong Alas, it does not help. Emptied my entire notification center (it did have "Reminders"), but no change. <comment323617> I could solve the same problem by removing every item in the Family-section (from Family Sharing). <comment323758> @K.Biermann Which settings do you mean? Which items? Do you speak of members of the family under iCloud Family settings? Or something under Internet Accounts / Reminders? <comment324750> Did anyone attempt to completely disable Notification Center from their computer? NC is cute, but prefer actually having a usable battery and not needing to stay plugged in the whole time. <comment325817> Out of the blue my own CalNCService started stampeding, and after trying everything I found online (i.e. disabling/re-enabling calendars and reminders, removing access by apps, restarting etc., more here: https://support.itsolver.net/hc/en-gb/articles/214098206-macOS-Sierra-CalNCService-high-CPU-usage), the last thing I did before CalNCService went back to normal was to remove ALL _widgets_ from Notifications Center's Today tab (i.e still leave notifications in place). Couple minutes later, while I was doing spindump on CalNCService process, I realized it'd gone back to normal already. <comment336505> After disabling Notification Center, iCloud Calendar, and Reminders do I need to quite the process? Not having any luck. <comment336626> @kyleplattner I did not have to quit anything. As soon as I enable Reminders in my cloud calender it goes to 100% CPU and as soon as I disbable it the process goes to zero. <comment348803> The fan replacement is preposterous. What kind of Apple store was that?? It's clearly a software problem. It's visible in activity monitor.
