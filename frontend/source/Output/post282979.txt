How can I fix unable to download pop up for said scenario <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VlKS4.png" alt="enter image description here"  My iPhone 5 can't download the app although  previously it downloaded. I had to delete it. There's a warning message that says "couldn't download the app at this time" and "done" and "retry". What can I do?  Every time I try to download this pops up. Picture. And it's really anoying I've already tried a bunch of stuff like with my wifi and I don't think that's the problem.   <comment356694> Perhaps [this page](http://www.iosemulatorspot.com/yalu-102-jailbreak-ios-10-2-1-0/) will help?
