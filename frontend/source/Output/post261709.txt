Fixed device names for multiple USB2Serial devices <body> I have a MacBook Pro, Early 2015, running macOS 10.12.1.  I have two USB to Serial adapters with the following properties:  ul liProduct ID: 0xea60/li liVendor ID: 0x10c4  (Silicon Laboratories, Inc.)/li liVersion: 1.00/li liSerial Number: 0001/li liSpeed: Up to 12 Mb/sec/li liManufacturer: Silicon Labs/li liLocation ID: 0x14240000 / 21/li liCurrent Available (mA): 500/li liCurrent Required (mA): 100/li liExtra Operating Current (mA): 0/li /ul  My serial adapters get connected and disconnected once in a while. Whenever I connect the first USB2Serial adapter it always gets the device name emcu.SLAB_USBtoUART/em. However, whenever I connect the second USB2Serial adapter it gets the same name but with a number as suffix, so something like cu.SLAB_USBtoUARTx where x can be anything between 1 and, the highest I have seen so far, 18.  This causes me to have to reconfigure any software that uses the second USB2Serial adapter to use the adapter with the correct number.  Is there a way to fix the interface numbers to cu..SLAB_USBtoUART and cu..SLAB_USBtoUART1 for the two USB2Serial adapters?
