Why can't my jailbroken iPhone connect to a wifi network? <body> I have an iPhone 3G 16GB with iOS 4.0.2 and my wifi is not working, I tried to fix it with reset network settings and other quick fixes like that but it still doesn't work. Sometimes it sees wifi networks but I can't connect. I don't think is a hardware problem because I can see the wifi MAC address on the device.  bVersion:/b 4.0.2 (8A400) (jailbreak with redsnow)br / bModem Firmware:/b 05.13.04  PS: On 3.1.2 the same thing. (jailbreak with blackrain)  strongDowngraded at 3.1.2, again...still nothing (jailbreak with redsnow)/strong  <answer1961> Try a stock (un-jailbroken) ipsw file from scratch. Use this procedure to downgrade properly.  I think that when you restore using your jailbroken image, you're just putting the problem back onto to the device. I've noticed that even after a brick, when I restore with redsn0w, it's not a clean install, as my previous applications and settings are still there. I think a fresh install of stock firmware may help. Jailbreak it only after you find out if original firmware works.   <answer1962> It may still be a hardware issue -- I had a similar problem last year. But since you say that your phone sometimes does emsee/em a wifi network, there's hope that the hardware is okay.  First, follow the comments posted here to make sure you're running a completely normal OS without any hacks or modifications.    Then, here's Apple's description of how to reset the network settings.  Lastly, if it still won't work, check my link above.  <answer1963> It seems that many users of 3G experienced the same problem with WIFI when uphgraded to iOS 4  Perhaps some of the solutions listed here would help. In you case you are probably left with the the last option     strongRestore, but not from a backup./strong One less-than-ideal fix for this issue   involves restoring the iPhone as a new   device rather than from a backup. It   appears that bad holdover data from   iPhone backups can cause loss of data   access. Restoring as a new phone will   delete contacts and other data, but   generally resolves this problem.      To do so, connect your iPhone or iPod   touch to your computer, click   “Restore” in iTunes, then choose   “setup as new phone.”   <answer220603> What worked for me is going to settings / General / reset / reset all settings  Good luck, mine jumped back to what it was like about a month ago then it worked fine from there!  <comment1681> Have you ever been able to connect to a WLAN at all? Or did you never succeed? <comment1682> And what are the specs on the WiFi network you want to connect to? (i.e security) <comment1683> Yes, I`ve been able to connect before but now it can't find any network (not from home or office, sometimes it does but it says something like "unable to connect") I had 3.1.2 before, 2 hours ago 4.0.2 now I have 3.1.2 again jailbreak with redsnow same thing. I can see the wifi mac address so I guess is not a hardware problem (once again sometimes sees the networks but it can't connect)  @Thomas is not the security, I disabled it nothing, with WPA nothing, router reset, iphone network reset still nothing... <comment1684> Was the iPhone already jailbroken when you successfully connected to your router? <comment1685> Yes it was, with blackrain and after 5 days or so, dead. <comment1686> So currently, you're on 3.1.2, correct? When you downgraded, did you use a stock firmware, or did you just put the redsn0w image on there right away? <comment1687> I restored with original (stock). <comment1688> Hmm.....I'll keep researching and let you know if I find anything new <comment1689> Yesterday when I tried again to see if it finds any network, it did (my home wifi) but guess what my internet did not work lol, but the device successfully connected 3 times, when I tried the 4th time it did not work anymore... This is some weird... <comment1690> It seems there is something, something that you wont believe... Here's the solution: You need one ****ed up iphone, one refrigerator. Take the iphone put it in the refrigerator (a/c) leave it for 5 minutes, and wow...it works. And I'm not making any jokes.  But there`s a problem, when the iphone get's some heat again...boom no wifi (again) So is a heating issue, if you guys know any permanent fixes to that let me know. (like making some small holes in the back of the device, i'm kidding now). <comment1691> LOL! Man, take it to the Apple Store <comment1692> It worked, I mean it. We don't have something like that in Romania... Just resellers and they suck. It seems that the wireless chip is fried... The a/c "fix" works only till the device get's heat again. (I just wanted to test the heat possibility and I was right.) <comment1693> Resent wont work. I already did a network reset, then a full reset same thing... <comment1694> I already did that, nothing. I downgraded from 4.0.2 to 3.1.2 same thing.
