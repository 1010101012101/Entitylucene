Permanently allow apps downloaded from "anywhere" <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nfJnh.png" alt="Screenshot of &quot;Choosing &#39;Anywhere&#39; makes your Mac less secure.&quot; popup"  I want to trust unidentified developers' applications. I've gone to System Preferences  Security &amp; Privacy and tried to enable "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere", but OS X claims it will reset my "Anywhere" selection after 30 days of inactivity. Actually, I don't want OS X to make it unusually difficult for me to use my software, ever. Is it possible to make this selection permanent?  <answer198123> It took me some time to figure this out but you can disable it through a global preference using the terminal:  precodesudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security GKAutoRearm -bool NO /code/pre  This will disable the auto rearming of the Gatekeeper in OS X. Tested on both Yosemite and Mavericks  <answer247055> Not enough to get the password, you need to change a new one (password) to allow apps downloaded from a particular source can run.  <comment235074> Not on Yosemite but on Mavericks, you can ctrl+click -open on the app to allow download <comment237164> Looking forward to this working in a month; for now I'll take your word for it! <comment304809> What do passwords have to do with Gatekeeper here?
