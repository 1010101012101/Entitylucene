How to add some additional DNS search domains without ignoring the DHCP ones? <body> I just want to add my own list of Search Domains but without overriding the ones returned by the DHCP?  As anyone would imagine I already tried to add them to Network  Advanced  DNS but adding them there it will override the ones from DHCP, which is not my intend.  It would be perfect if I could add them after the ones form DHCP, but I would also accept a solution that adds them after.   2nd try would be code/etc/resolv.conf/code but the message from the file is as clear as it can be:  precode# This file is not used by the host name and address resolution # or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by most processes on # this Mac OS X system. # # This file is automatically generated. /code/pre  Personally, I would send the guy who wrote this message to do some phone support for two months. So, he would learn to add some hints next time he documents things: where are you supposed to tune the settings? or include a link to a knowledge base article.  Still, I don't want something that is lost on minor OS X update.  How can I do this for OS X 10.7 ?  <answer51098> Add them to System Preferences  Network  Advanced  | DNS |   (Any particular reason for this being down-voted?  It does exactly what the requester is asking for and doesn't require the use of a Terminal.)  <answer51114> Perhaps try adding/appending them to code/etc/resolv.conf/code? You cannot add them to the end of the list manually, delimiting with a comma in Lion? It seems to work in 10.6, it adds it in addition to the DHCP supplied ones, and the entire lot of them show up in resolv.conf instantly.   Perhaps this won't work for your purposes, but why not just manually add the ones DHCP supplied and the ones you want to add and save them in System Preferences?  Then you won't need to worry about overwriting anything as you will be manually adding them.  I don't suppose your domain is going to change names very frequently.    I can tell you as of Snow Leopard mDNSResponder (Bonjour) handles all the DNS (not just Multicast DNS).    <answer72442> You could use the codenetworksetup/code command, and add the additional search domains in an array on the comand line: From the man page:  precode-setsearchdomains networkservice domain1 [domain2] [...]  Use this command to designate the search domain for the specified &lt;networkservice&gt;. You can list any number of search domains (replace domain1, domain2, and so on with the name of a local domain). If you want to clear all search domain entries for the specified network service, type aemptya in place of the domain /code/pre  So:  precodesudo networksetup -setsearchdomains Wi-Fi legacydomain.com secondlegacydomain.com additionaldomain.org evenmoresearchdomain.net /code/pre  this invocation should have the proper order.  <answer253026> Just put a file in /etc/resolver/ with a name such as "searchappend" with these contents:  precodesearch example.com /code/pre  Just don't name the file "com" or some other valid TLD. This works because of OSX's resolver magic.  For more info, read through https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/resolver.5.html  I have a file there called "consul" that looks like this:  precodenameserver 127.0.0.1 port 8600 search consul /code/pre  That magically makes it so .consul is appended to the search path, and any resolving for .consul TLDs uses my local nameserver.  <answer253035> Assuming your router provides its set of DNS servers, add its IP address (your routerâ€™s) to your strongDNS Servers/strong list. Add your own DNS servers below it.  Your computer will query your router first, then cycle through the ones you defined manually.  <comment58449> You might explain a bit more what you've tried and why entering search domains in the normal place isn't what you want. Specifically - do you want your search domains to be searched before the DHCP ones or after the supplied ones? <comment63134> Because he wrote that he didn't want to override the DHCP DNS entries.  Plus you would have to add them to every interface. <comment206847> `resolve.conf` usage is deprecated, being documented inside the file. <comment206848> While I love the command line approach I have to say that running this does override the DNS domains received from the DHCP server, so is not a proper solution. I still want to be able able to used them, just to add mine on top of bottom of the list. Need an automated solution.
