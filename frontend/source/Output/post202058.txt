get link to iCloud file from finder without having to go to iCloud website? <body> Is it possible to get a remote link to a file via finder? I want to be able to share my screenshots really quickly which are now saved to an iCloud folder. Thanks, D.  <answer202191> I don't believe this is possible as of Yosemite 10.10.5. The sharing menu would be a sensible place for this, but it doesn't have an option to send or copy a link to the file, choosing Mail or Messages will attach the full file:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/VUTHY7b.jpg" alt="Current share options"  Personally I use Dragshare to quickly get a remote link to a file, or if you save your files to Dropbox you can just alt-click and choose Share Dropbox Link.   <comment243899> Thanks but really want this to be an apple solution. iCloud is such a major part of apple devices i don't want to pay for the space required for dropbox. The free space i have is already nearly full. As a short term solution i've created an applescript that adds images in a folder to a Photos album. I'll then have to create a shared album per project.
