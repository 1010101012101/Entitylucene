Is there anything like NVELO Dataplex (hybrid SSD/HDD software) for OS X? <body> I'm interested in upgrading my old MacBook to using an SSD and moving the data drive to where the DVD drive is using an optibay.  Often SSDs come with a licence for NVELO Dataplex software (which is windows only). This software is basically a windows driver that keeps track of commonly used files and moves then to the SSD, thereby giving you a hybrid SSD.  strongIs there anything like NVELO Dataplex for OS X/strong or should I just put OS X and applications on the SSD, and put home folders on the HDD using symbolic links?  <answer59816> I have been thinking the same since I learned about Nvelo Dataplex and recently I stumbled upon ssdcache  It looks like they are working on versions for Mac, Linux and Windows.  <answer146595> This is an old question, but for the benefit of anyone who comes across it: Apple introduced this capability under the name strongFusion Drive/strong in late 2012. Officially you can only get a Fusion Drive as a build-to-order option on a new Mac, but many people have reported success with configuring their own using the codediskutil/code Terminal command in OS X 10.8.2 or later.  <comment69385> Looks like what I'm looking for. I'm thinking about participating in the beta <comment200188> This answer is obsolete now, the linked site in the answer is no longer available.
