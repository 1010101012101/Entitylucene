Lion not getting installed properly <body> I bought a used Mac that only had Windows 7 installed. The seller didn't have the original OS DVD, and the hard drive only had a single NTFS partition. I downloaded Lion from a torrent, burned it to a DVD and attempted to install it. When I create a user, it errors out and continues to ask me to create a user again and again.  How do I get past the user creation step?  <answer65387> One solution would be to not download a copy of OS X from a torrent, you never know what you are getting.   ol liObtain a legal, trusted copy of OS X. If your Mac supports it you can get Mountain Lion for $19.99 USD from the App Store, if not you can order OS X Lion from apple for probably around $29.99.  ul liBorrow a friends Mac, visit a Mac at an Apple Store, etc., log in to Mac App Store using your Apple ID./li liBuy and download OS X./li liMake a boot-able USB OS X installer/li liLog out of app store/li liDelete the installer you downloaded. /li /ul/li liBoot from that copy, by holding down the option key while booting your mac./li liRun Disk Utility from the OS X install media, erase the entire hard drive./li liInstall OS X/li liEnjoy.../li /ol  <comment76819> Which mac do you have? <comment76917> And what OS did it ship with?
