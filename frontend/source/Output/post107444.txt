Preview is not responding since OS X Mavericks update <body> Preview is not responding for me since the OS X Mavericks update. I cannot open JPEG images. If I try to go to full screen view, I just get the beachball and have to hard reboot. I am a photographer and use this feature extensively to check images. This worked fine before upgrade to OS X Mavericks.  Is there anything I can do to resolve this issue?  <answer107452> The first thing to try when encountering something like this is to move the preferences files to a new folder. I usually put them on the Desktop.  First, Quit Preview and then go to the Finder and move these files to the Desktop:  ul licode/Users/&lt;short user name&gt;/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview/code/li licode/Users/&lt;short user name&gt;/Library/com.apple.preview.*/code/li /ul  Run Preview and see if it is fixed.  In the case of Preview, there probably isn't any information in these files that you will really miss, It should be stuff like the previously viewed files, and whatever is in the "Preferences" dialog.  <answer117498> Another thing to try is to repair disk permissions (advisable after a system update). A third option is to download and manually reinstall the same combo update as the last update.  <answer189999> Delete: ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Preview.LSSharedFileList.plist   <comment137279> I was having a different problem which, elsewhere, the solution was "reinstall OS X." I tried this, and it solved my crashing-Preview problem. Thanks! <comment137283> Welcome to Ask Different. Glad I could help. <comment222478> I was also having a similar problem, and though I had not ~/Library/com.apple.preview.* directory, removing the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.Preview was sufficient to fix my problem. Thanks!
