Remotely control MacBook Pro Retina <body> The rMBP dropped the infrared receiver making Apple Remote useless with it. It's a shame, since Airplay + Apple TV + Apple Remote would have worked as a perfect combo.  So, while playing a movie with Quicktime / VLC and streaming it to the TV, how can I control the playing (pause, skip, rewind...) remotely? Is the iPhone or an iPad of any help? Is there any remote-control app?  <answer57961> Are you trying to remote control the Apple TV? Or are you trying to remote control the MacBook Pro? (both will work!)  There's the Remote app (emby Apple, not affiliated/em) which can control the Apple TV, and there are probably lots of 'VLC Remote' apps if you are trying to control VLC itself.  ul liVLC Remote Free for iOS here/li liVLC Remote (paid) for iOS here/li /ul  These work directly with the VLC client and allow for the full control experience - media selection, play, pause, rewind, forward etc.  <answer62288> Check out Rowmote, Hippo Remote. They will let you control any mac and application for media purposes or just for using a wireless keyboard and mouse from your iOS device.  <answer65799> The remote app for iPhone will let you control any Mac or PC running iTunes. Remember, though, it controls iTunes, not the whole Mac. There is also a Keynote Remote app that will supposedly let you remote control that app, but I've not tried it, though.
