You can’t change the startup disk to the selected disk? <body> I am booting my macbook through an external usb drive. At system preferences - startup disk when I try to select my internal harddisk it says:  precodeYou can’t change the startup disk to the selected disk. The bless tool was unable to set the current boot disk. /code/pre  What could be the issue with the internal drive or how can I fix it?  <answer181138> The first thing I'd try is resetting the NVRAM:  ol liShut down your Mac./li liLocate the following keys on the keyboard: Command (⌘), Option, P, and R.  Turn on your Mac./li liPress and hold the kbd⌘/kbd+kbdOption/kbd+kbdP/kbd+kbdR/kbd keys immediately after you hear the startup sound./li liHold these keys until the computer restarts and you hear the startup sound strongfor a second time/strong./li liRelease the keys./li /ol  ...and see if that solves your problem. If it doesn't, I'd start worrying about a hardware fault.  <answer250812> I had the same issue when I was adding a new external HD to boot from.  My original boot drive started giving me this error.  It was still usable, and I could boot from it if I held the option key down during startup and selected it, but could not select it from Sys Prefs without getting an error.  I tried all the Disk Utility things to no avail.  It was only when I reset the NVRAM with the cmd, option, p &amp; r solution that everything went back to normal.    <comment215350> This, combined with your earlier question, tells me the HD is dead or dying. Concentrate on recovery of any data not yet backed up & then get a new drive <comment215364> it restarts but then in the startup apple logo screen there are some error messages: can't perform kext scan : no kext summary <comment215365> Does this happen after you've heard the second chime and released the keys, or before? <comment215366> After the second time <comment215373> Can you access the files on that internal HD when booting from the USB stick? <comment215374> I can open it in the finder but won't let me reinstall/unmount it <comment215378> Can you boot into safe mode? (CMD + R at startup) <comment215380> No not possible <comment215385> I'm not sure there's even a point in trying an SMC, so I'd concentrate on recovery as Tetsujin suggested earlier. You have plenty of reaons to do that by now. <comment317249> This could be caused by the drive not having a GUID partition scheme.
