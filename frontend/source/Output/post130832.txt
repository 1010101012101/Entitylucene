How do I jailbreak an iphone 3gs without activating it? <body> I have been given an old iphone 3gs that has a bug: It cannot be activated, neither through WiFi nor iTunes.  Over WiFi it sais, that the activation server is not availiable and over iTunes, iTunes complains, that there is no SIM card in the device (which is not true, and this SIM card works fine in other devices)  Is there a way to jailbreak it before activating it?  Or what should I do?
