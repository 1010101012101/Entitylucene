How do I sort the photos on my iPhone by timestamp? <body> I have a lot of photos on my iphone from a recent trip.  The filenames are all similar (Nikon irritatingly only counting up to 1000, and I took 5000 photos), and while I've ensured there is no collision the filenames are not sorted in time order.   However, the time the photo was taken in the metadata is of course correct.  How can I sort the photos by that?  Thanks, /YGA
