Using `say` to create my own audiobooks <body> I like the idea of being able to select a bunch of text and have it saved as an audio file and/or simply read back to me using OS X's default codesay/code functionality. It's almost like I can create my own instant personal audiobooks anytime I like. The problem is; the default voices, and more specifically, the robotic speech patterns, can get become quite unbearable to listen to. Is there a solution or an alternative available to overcome this problem? Thanks in advance.  <answer215035> ul liRead Me a Book/li liTell Me A Story/li liTextSpeech Pro for Mac OS X/li /ul  And you can write own program:  ul liUse speak/li liUse own voice, but so hard because need voice for all words and need some tones :)/li /ul  <answer215039> h1Optional Voices in OS X/h1  OS X includes support for numerous languages, take a look at the strongOther Languages/strong section of Speaking with a French accent – OS X say.

Though that would only enable you to lengthen a pause between words, not shorten one. Still, that enables you to make the rhythm more natural. You can probably adjust the volume using applescript too, but im not sure. If you can you could make the volume louder for things in caps, and/or titles/headings. You could probably even make a script to take some text and make replace different things with various delays (i.e., replace commas with a certain length of delay), volume adjustments (if thats possible to begin with) and similar stuff.  precodesay "you're right" delay 0.6 say "she breathed very loudly" delay 0.4 say "even back then" delay 0.7 say "but she made up for it in other ways, " delay 0.3 say "that" delay 0.6 say "is why i married your mother." delay 0.5 say "and if all goes well tonight" delay 0.2 say "i'l find a new mother for you and you can meet her in the morning." delay 0.6 say "barring that" delay 0.5 say "i'd would say youll have her before the end of the we" delay 0.7 say "well" delay 0.5 say "if i was a betting man" delay 1.5 say "i'd say two weeks max" delay 1.3 say "maybe a month" delay 0.3 say "no more thanthat" delay 1 say "i think." /code/pre  <comment259688> Have You tried all the voices? In System Preferences - Dictation & Speech there's a possibility to download additional voices. Some of them are not so "robotic". <comment259702> @MateuszSzlosek I have done, yeah. The problem is not so much the ***timbre or dialect***. It's more; the ***unnatural rhythm & inappropriate tone*** (or lack thereof) that make it difficult to follow. <comment265656> Wow, that seems time consuming. The whole idea is to save time. Very interesting though, thank-you :) . So where does this `delay` command come from, anyway? Is it part of a suite, with commands like `say`? Or is it something different entirely? <comment265698> i think so yes. I think theyre in the same suite but only because theyre both always available, (they might not be in the same suite),
