Is there a decent icon editor for OS X capable of editing .icns files? <body> The software for editing icons needs to run on OSX Lion.  <answer40658> I would think that the program Opacity would be a good place to start for designing icon art as well as all manner of math and code drawing options.  It was designed from the ground up to do vector drawing and output many sizes of a master drawing as needed for icons to work well. Due to both limited resolutions for small icons as well as beefy artwork scaled up for resolution independence, the layers and tools work well.  The free trial should let you know if the tutorials and help on building icons is suitable for your skill level and needs.  <answer40772> Is depends on the kind of editing you need to do. icns Editor is on the App Store. Maybe this one too?  <answer40776> Apple provides Icon Composer as part of their free developer tools.  This is the only officially sanctioned way to create icns files. Most other editors don't support all the possible features.  The idea is you create a png file for each size you want, then create an icns file in Icon Composer, and import your various png files into it.  <answer80745> In 10.5+, Apple's built-in strongPreivew.app/strong lets you do edit code.icns/code files!  (Preview used to be pretty bare-bones back in 10.2 days, but with every OS release it has gotten more and more powerful.)  After opening the file, use the up/down arrow keys to switch between the different sized icon and bitmask images contained in the .icns file.  Then with each image you can:  ul liCut/Copy/Paste/li liAnnotate (draw rectangles, add text, lines, arrows, ...)/li liChange transparency/li liScale/li liAdjust color (saturation, tint, sharpness, etc)/li /ul  <answer129944> Use web tools: 1.

Paste is never enabled. Does that still work for you? <comment278111> You can cut (clear) and paste. But before hitting cmd+X or cmd+V, you need to select an area with the rectangular selection tool, to act as a "target" of the clipboard operation. If you select an area alrger than the icon size, it will automatically clip to its bounds (e.g., 1024 x 1024). <comment286170> I strongly suggest people to look at [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13127142/1011366) (it gives information on how to access the images embedded inside an ICNS file) or [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20703594/1011366) (which is a script that generates an ICNS from a single image)
