Convert Mac to Windows paths and visa-versa for sharing with colleagues <body> Wanted to share perhaps a more thorough answer to this question: How to translate between Windows and Mac -style file locations?  But since I'm new and got no cred on this site, I'm posting as new question - sorry about that... just wanted to give back since the answer the above was helpful, but still required some hacking I wanted to save others the hassle.  strongPROBLEM/strong  From a Mac, I want to copy a file path on a network share into an email so that its clickable by poor Windows recipients. Currently, I copy/paste the path, e.g.:      smb://servername/MLS/Timbers/IrrefutableProofTimbersAreBestTeamInMLS.pdf  into an email, then manually convert it to a Windows path:      \\servername\MLS\Timbers\IrrefutableProofTimbersAreBestTeamInMLS.pdf  But that’s a stupid thing to do over and over, so I found some examples online (this forum and others) and hacked it until I got it to work a few ways (see below).  A related problem is when Windows users send me a file path and I want to quickly access it. Currently, I manually navigate to it by translating the path in my little head, which hurts. So, I reversed the hack above and added a call to open the folder to the file.  strongSOLUTION/strong  In Mac OS Automator I created three Apple scripts that run as a service. This enables me to select a path, right-click and choose the appropriate service from the “Services…” menu, which I named:  ul li“Convert Windows to Mac path and open it”/li li“Convert Windows to Mac path”/li li“Convert Mac to Windows path”/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQE7g.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongDETAILS/strong  precode **Script: “Convert Windows to Mac path and open it”**   on searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)             set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString             set newText to text items of theText             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString             set newText to newText as text             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims             return newText  end searchReplace   on run {input, parameters}             set myClip to the input             set mytext to searchReplace(myClip, "&lt;", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;.", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;", "")             set findIt to "\\"             set replaceIt to "/"             set mylocation to searchReplace(mytext, findIt, replaceIt)             set mylocation to "smb:" &amp; mylocation             tell application "Finder"                 open location mylocation             end tell             return input  end run   -- Thanks to: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/144916/how-to-change-filepath-structure-using-automator-windows-to-mac --    **Script: “Convert Windows to Mac path”**   on searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)             set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString             set newText to text items of theText             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString             set newText to newText as text             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims             return newText  end searchReplace   on run {input, parameters}             set myClip to the input             set mytext to searchReplace(myClip, "&lt;", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;.", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;", "")             set findIt to "\\"             set replaceIt to "/"             set mylocation to searchReplace(mytext, findIt, replaceIt)             set mylocation to "smb:" &amp; mylocation             return mylocation              end run    **Script: “Convert Mac to Windows path”**   on searchReplace(theText, SearchString, ReplaceString)             set OldDelims to AppleScript's text item delimiters             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to SearchString             set newText to text items of theText             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to ReplaceString             set newText to newText as text             set AppleScript's text item delimiters to OldDelims             return newText  end searchReplace   on run {input, parameters}             set myClip to the input             set mytext to searchReplace(myClip, "&lt;", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;.", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "&gt;", "")             set mytext to searchReplace(mytext, "smb://", "\\\\")             set findIt to "/"             set replaceIt to "\\"             set mylocation to searchReplace(mytext, findIt, replaceIt)             return mylocation  end run /code/pre  Screenshots of the last script:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5KnkK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment347423> Welcome to Ask Different. - please put your solution in the answer section.
