Change the background effect in Launchpad on Yosemite <body> In Mavericks I learned that the keyboard combination control+option+command+B would allow the user to cycle through the various background effects (blur, no blur, black and white, etc.). However, this keyboard combination doesn't appear to have any effect in OS X 10.10 Yosemite. Is there a way for the user to accomplish this task in Yosemite?  System: Mac mini, late 2012 running OS X 10.10 with the Apple Wireless Keyboard  <answer173756> Previous versions of OS X had ways to disable this, but starting in OS X 10.10, you can't. The launcher, login screen, and mission control all have blurry backgrounds, it looks hideous, and you are stuck with it.  <comment180043> the control+option+command+B does not work on my Mavericks? <comment180050> Buscar, does command+B work for you?
