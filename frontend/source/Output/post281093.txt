lost phone and password Apple ID <body> I have used iPhone 6s before it was stolen in December 2016. I bought an iPhone 7 Plus but cannot login into my old account. I already tried to sign in but it failed. It seems that the password has changed. I tried all my password possibilities but it still will not work.  I need to login to my Apple ID because all my applications are linked with the old iPhone. I had also tried to enter my credit card number but still not work.  <answer281094> If you are sure that you have the correct email address for the Apple ID, you could try to reset the password using the following link: appleid.apple.com  The website will ask for your birthday and possibly also your security questions.  If you don't know the answer to your security questions anymore, you can contact Apple Care.
