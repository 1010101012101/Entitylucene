I forgot the Password for WPA/WPA2 Personal where can I get it <body> I'am trying to set up a wireless connection to my HP OfficeJet printer. For this I need to enter the password to my WLAN which I forgot.  How and where can I retrieve it?  <answer75528> ol liOpen the strongKeychain Access/strong app (located in the strongUtilities/strong folder, within the strongApplications/strong folder)./li liIn the search box (upper right corner), type in the name of your Wi-Fi network./li liDouble click the corresponding entry in the main panel. If there is more than one, look for the most recent one with a type matching "AirPort network password"./li liClick the checkbox labelled emShow password/em, and enter your user account password when prompted. The password will be displayed in the text box, where you can copy it as needed./li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VAJyx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer83063> If you have Cydia on your iPhone, iPod or iPad you can download "strongWiFi Passwords/strong" from Xsellize repo. Its free and it will show you all your stored WiFi networks you've been connected to along with their associated passwords.  Is not hacking, is just reading the stored information stored in your iPhone, iPod or iPad.  <answer83064> As a last resort, you can reset your WLAN to factory settings and put in a new password of your choice...  <answer240386> take a backup of the router config file and use nirsoft tools to view the config file in order to get the password in text format.  <comment87688> Did you look in your system and log in keychain? <comment87704> If it's not stored in the keychain, you will be out of luck unless you recall somewhere else you stored that information on your Mac. <comment87705> Many (but certainly not all) routers store the password in plaintext in their web interface. But of course this requires knowing the password to thatâ€¦ <comment87706> Do you have access to your router's admin interface? Typically at `192.168.1.1` <comment95745> The question is about OS X not for iOS. <comment95773> @maseth It's still a good answer since anywhere the password is recorded will help the asker - especially if it's not in the keychain. Of course, that's a more likely answer, but I bet this helps someone at some point. <comment122481> In a sense, the router maintains the password for the WLAN and all the other answers are similar to looking for the password written on a yellow sticky note. <comment295458> Welcome to Ask Different.
