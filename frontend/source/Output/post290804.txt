Facing Pages in Pages 6.x <body> I think this question is fairly straight-forward: is there any way to get Pages 6.x (I have 6.2) to have facing pages? I typically word-process in Pages '09, however that doesn't have right-to-left support and I don't need Adobe InDesign for this project.  <answer290805> It's not possible, this question comes up frequently in the Apple forums, e.g.  here.  Word Mac 2016 is supposed to be able to do mirrored margins and RTL.  Also I think Nisus Writer.  <answer295452> I have tried to resolve this issue by opening the Pages document in OOD and there it can be formatted with mirror margins. It worked.  Negatively this process changed some fonts (from italic to normal)  issues. So, if you are aware of the pitfalls you can produce a document for printing (OOD is free) Now I am back to square 1, wondering what can be done as this is a large document and easy to miss bugs. Apache Open Office 4 was the program I used.  Marie   <comment367089> Apple really hasn't addressed that in the last four years?! <comment367090> Progress in restoring lost Pages 09 features has been glacial.  We just got back linked text boxes finally. <comment367096> Has anyone with contacts to Apple software execs tried to exert influence? <comment367097> Also, Word sucks at RTL support. I'd use Pages '09, but that also sucks at RTL support. <comment367101> @NoahM I would be interested in specific problems with word 2016 RTL if you have time .  You can email tom at bluesky dot org
