Does Growl keep a history? <body> Does strongGrowl/strong, either natively or with an extension, keep a history, possibly accessible through a graphic interface?  (something like strongJumpcut/strong, I mean)  I'm talking about OSX 10.6 (hence Growl 1.2.2), I dunno if the Lion version is different.  <answer38243> Growl 1.3 (available on the Mac App Store) supports a history of notifications, and additionally a rollup of all notifications while you are away from the computer. Unfortunately it requires Mac OS X Lion. You can get to the history right from the Growl Preferences.  Earlier versions did not have this feature.  <comment43323> Which Growl version though? <comment43325> @Gerry 1.2.2, as it is the last version available for Snow Leopard. Accepted your answer. <comment43331> I wasn't aware the MAS version is not supported under Snow Leopard, but indeed it seems to be the case.
