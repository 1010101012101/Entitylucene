Autoupdate the desktop background from an online photo webcam <body> I would like to set my desktop background to a webcam picture that updates several times an hour, for instance to this view of Tegernsee. I am looking for a way to automatically get that picture every couple of minutes from the internet and update the desktop background. How can I do that (I would prefer a bash or applescript solution)?  <answer209971> You might want to try VideoWall HD, available for US$1.99 in the App Store.  I don't use it myself, but I have a friend in Portland who likes it. She doesn't use a web-cam, but this capability is touted in the App Store splash info.  <answer210120> I have found a way to make this work with launchd. This requires two steps: First creating a script that downloads the webcam picture, and second creating a LaunchAgent plist file that will call the script every so often.  This method will update the background picture of a specific Space, but only while you are on that space (also, when logging in and maybe when waking from sleep).  h1First step: Creating a script that downloads the picture and changes the desktop background/h1  ol liCreate a folder, e.g. code~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Webcam/code./li liSelect that folder to be your desktop backgrounds folder in System Preferences → Destkop &amp; Screen Saver./li liWrite a text file with the following content:  precode#!/bin/bash shopt -s extglob # required for fancy rm # This script updates the desktop background of a specific Space to a webcam picture # while you are currently on that space. # # Choose a webcam:  remotepic=http://www.foto-webcam.org/webcam/wallberg/current/full.jpg  # Choose a desktop backgrounds pictures folder of the Space where you want to see the webcam # (you have to set this manually in System Preferences → Destkop &amp; Screen Saver):  webcampicturefolder=~/Library/Desktop\ Pictures/Webcam  # check the desktop background pictures folder of the current Space currentpicturefolder=`osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to get pictures folder of current desktop"` # only proceed if you are currently on the space where you want to see the webcam if [ "$currentpicturefolder" == "$webcampicturefolder" ] ; then   localpic="$webcampicturefolder"/$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).jpg   backup="$webcampicturefolder"/backup.jpg   #remove all but the previous backup file and txt files:   rm "$webcampicturefolder"/!(*txt|`basename "$backup"`) 2&gt;&gt;/dev/null   # get the new picture unless there is a connection failure (-f flag):   curl -fs -o "$localpic" "$remotepic"   # make a backup of the new picture:   cp "$localpic" "$backup" 2&gt;&gt;/dev/null   # if no new picture has been downloaded, copy from backup:   cp "$backup" "$localpic"   # see http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/features/system-prefs.html   osascript -e "   tell application \"System Events\"     tell current desktop       set picture rotation to 0       set picture to POSIX file \"$localpic\"     end tell   end tell   " fi /code/pre/li liSave the file, e.g. as code~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Webcam/getwebcam.sh/code/li liMake it executable by issuing the following command in the Terminal:  precodechmod u+x ~/Library/Desktop Pictures/Webcam/getwebcam.sh /code/pre/li /ol  h1Second step: Creating a LaunchAgent plist that calls the script/h1  ol liWrite a text file with the following content. You need to adapt the string code/Users/myusername/Library/Desktop Pictures/Webcam/getwebcam.sh/code so it points to the script created in the first step. You cannot use a relative path with code~/code. Change the dict elements with the "Minute" key as you see fit – you can add more of them. The integer determines at which minute of every hour the script will be called (see also codeman launchd.plist/code on your Terminal).  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt; &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt; &lt;dict&gt;   &lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;string&gt;me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;string&gt;/Users/myusername/Library/Desktop Pictures/Webcam/getwebcam.sh&lt;/string&gt;   &lt;/array&gt;   &lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;true/&gt;   &lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;   &lt;array&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;integer&gt;01&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;integer&gt;16&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;integer&gt;31&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;     &lt;dict&gt;       &lt;key&gt;Minute&lt;/key&gt;       &lt;integer&gt;46&lt;/integer&gt;     &lt;/dict&gt;   &lt;/array&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; &lt;/plist&gt; /code/pre/li liSave the text file to code~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist/code – the name should match the "Label" key in the file./li liLoad it by issuing the following command:  precodelaunchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/me.myname.update-desktop-from-webcam.plist /code/pre/li /ol  <comment253550> Many thanks for the tip. I trust it would work, though I have not tried it since I do not like the app store.
