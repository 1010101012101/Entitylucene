Factory Reset MacBook but it is in Japanese <body> I have a MacBook Air (A1466). I do not know the password for the screen lock. It has been set on Japanese (I only know English).  I can not do a Factory Reset because I don't understand Japanese. Can anyone walk me through Factory Reset, while it is in Japanese? How do I change the language of my MacBook if it is in Japanese, but I do not know the password?  <answer265563> The OS Controls language. You will need to boot a different OS to that machine and run through the set up assistant to choose a different language for the new OS or you need someone to make you a new user account on that machine to change the OS.   ul lihttps://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904/li /ul  The only thing that can foil this plan is if there's a firmware password on the Mac. That would prevent you from Internet booting to recovery or bringing another external  OS to the Mac  <answer265587> There's a nifty trick you can try and do to trick macOS into thinking it hasn't been setup yet.   ul liRestart the MacBook with strongCommand + S/strong held down to get to the Single User mode (essentially Terminal)/li liCheck the filesystem with codefsck -fy/code/li liMount the root drive as mountable with codemount -uw //code/li liCarefully type coderm /var/db/.applesetupdone/code  which removes the file the MacBook checks for when updating the software /li liType codereboot/code to reboot the MacBook and you'll be presented with the first step of setting up macOS which is Language Selection/li /ul  Hope this helps!  strongPlease be careful when fiddling with Single User mode as mistypes can cause a lot of issues with your system/strong  <comment332930> Can you boot to internet recovery?
