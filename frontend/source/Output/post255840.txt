Where has dictation and speech gone on Sierra? <body> https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202584 says      Choose Apple menu  System Preferences, then click Dictation &amp; Speech.    I'm sure it used to be there, I've set it up in the past, but now I have Sierra, I cannot find it. Apple - system preferences - View gives me this list:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vq5zT.png" alt="meun screenshot"  and I can't see dictation there. I looked under codeAccessibility/code, and there is a codedictation/code feature there, but this is all it says:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6e7hQ.png" alt="accessibility screenshot"  and that looks different. I looked under codeSiri/code, and that has settings for speech output accent (it's a really awful accent, too, I can hear the quantisation, not enough bits) but not for dictation. I looked under codeSound/code, and it's not there.  strongWhere is Dictation and Speech Preference on Sierra, please?/strong  <answer255842> It's moved to the keyboard settings. codeApple - System Preferences - Keyboard - Dictation/code.  I used the codeSearch/code feature in codeSystem Preferences/code to find it. I didn't even know there was a search feature...  <answer285553> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nBJK.png" alt="Look the picture"  As you can see the speech is in Accessibility, is the fifth option in the menu
