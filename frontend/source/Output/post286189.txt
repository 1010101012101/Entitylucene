Stuck in endless macOS Sierra installation loop <body> I am a long time Apple Mac user since the 1990s, and I have strongnever/strong come across this sort of ridiculous behaviour before.  Yesterday I decided to reinstall macOS Sierra on my iMac. I followed these steps:  ol liI used Command-R to boot into macOS Recovery./li liI selected Disk Utility from the macOS Utilities window./li liI opted to erase the HD with a 2 pass secure erase. This was successful./li liI quit Disk Utility./li liI selected Reinstall macOS from the macOS Utilities window./li liI clicked continue when it told me to click ‘continue’ to set up the installation./li liI clicked continue again when it told me to click ‘continue’ to download and restore macOS/li liAnd now I’m back at Step 6 again and get stuck in a loop between steps 6 &amp; 7./li /ol  I have tried the above steps again today with the exact same result. Below is a visual representation of this madness:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2LHFK.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Also, clicking on 'continue' instantly displays the next/previous screen - there is no indication that anything else is happening - not even the apparent eligibility check.  strongHow do I get out of this looping hell?/strong  I did read installation stuck in a loop due to damaged HD and Mac OS X Sierra installation stuck in a reboot loop but neither is about the same looping scenario as I find myself in.  <answer286194> This is the type of UX pain that really irks me, and very unlike Apple.  Since you're a long time Mac user I'm going to assume you have access to another Mac, so my suggestion would be to try reinstalling a fresh version of macOS Sierra via a USB installer.  Follow the steps below:  ol liOn another Mac, download the macOS Sierra installer via the Mac App Store /li liAfter its downloaded, the installer will launch automatically. When it does, strongquit the installer/strong./li liGrab a USB flash drive of at least 8GB in size/li liConnect the USB flash drive to the same Mac/li liRename the flash drive to emUntitled/em/li liLaunch the Terminal app /li liNow enter the following command into Terminal. It may be best to just copy it from here (try triple-clicking) and paste it in.   codesudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/code/li liYou will be prompted to enter your user password. Enter it now and press kbdreturn/kbd (note that you won’t see the cursor move or display any of the characters you enter)/li liAt the next prompt (about erasing your drive) press the kbdY/kbd key/li liWait for your USB flash drive to be erased (you’ll see the progress via % values appearing within the Terminal window)/li liOnce the erasure is complete, you will see a prompt that files are being copied to the disk. This may take a while, so be patient./li liEventually the emcopy/em process will be over and you should see a emDone/em message in Terminal. You can now quit Terminal./li liEject the USB flash drive and now connect it to your iMac (the one you want to reinstall macOS Sierra on)/li liStartup the iMac holding down the kbdoption/kbd key/li liSelect the USB flash drive you created from the list of drives and press kbdenter/kbd/li /ol  You should now be able to boot from the USB drive and install macOS Sierra from there.  Let me know if you have any questions.  <answer288877> I had same issue but after connecting to wifi I was able to continue!   <answer291619> I also had this and it was the wifi just needed reconnecting to allow verification. .   <answer294262> I just had this issue with High Sierra Beta 4 installation, after about 6-7 loops on APFS file system, I erased my hard disk from Disk Utility and made new partition with HFS+ Journaled file system, then it went through.  Funny thing is, after installation is done, it says that my file system is APFS.  <comment361135> Thank you for your answer. This works, but now I get kernel panics when I bootup. Can you help? Here is my question about it: https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/286267/240852 <comment366924> This was the (much quicker) fix for me. I totally missed the "disconnected wifi logo" in the top-right until this comment prompted me to look for it. <comment368186> Hi Ray, and welcome to Ask Different!

I was nearly ready to call out an imac doctor!! Reading these threads online are so helpful! Cheers
