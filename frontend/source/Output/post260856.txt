Slideshow IDE for programmers? <body> Is there a slideshow editor similar to Powerpoint, but for Mac, that supports codecode/code pens and maybe emmarkdown/em?  Thanks  <answer260863> I don't know if you would call it "similar" to PowerPoint as PowerPoint isn't focused on MarkDown or code, but a nice Mac app is "Deckset" 1.  Another option is to use the browser-based Remark 2. However it is not a native Mac app as such.
