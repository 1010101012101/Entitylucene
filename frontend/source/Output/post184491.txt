Oracle's Java 1.8 appears to not actually install itself <body> I have searched for answers this problem, but nobody seems to have such a basic problem as I have. I have Java 1.7 installed and tried to install 1.8 - both through the Java control panel and manually downloading 1.8 (45) and running that. Each installation method appears to work without issue, however, Java 1.8 is not to be found on my Mac.  I have looked in the following locations:  precode/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines /code/pre  I even resorted to a comprehensive search after Spotlight failed to find it:  precode% sudo find / -type d -name jdk1.\*.jdk /code/pre  That find(1) found the 1.7 installation, but not the 1.8.  So, I am puzzled, both why 1.8 did not install properly and where is it? I can mangle the links to install it manually, if somebody can point me to where I might find it, or even what I could have possible done wrong while "clicking OK" during the install.

This might help you discover if the installer is having a problem when it is trying to install Java 1.8 on your system. By default it is set to "Show Errors Only" but you can see more detail by changing it to "Show All Logs" from the drop-down in the top-left corner of the Log window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMOOT.png" alt="Example of Installer Log window"  Another way to see exactly what is happening when you are installing Java 1.8 is to use the following command in a Terminal window, replacing PATHTOINSTALLPACKAGE with the location of the "JDK 8 Update 45.pkg" file. The easy way to do this is to type (or copy and paste) the first part of the command up to "-pkg " and then drag and drop the PKG file (the one with the yellow cube emerging form the brown box icon) onto the Terminal window.  precode sudo installer -verboseR -target / -pkg PATHTOINSTALLPACKAGE /code/pre  So you should end up with something like this.  precode sudo installer -verboseR -target / -pkg /Volumes/JDK\ 8\ Update\ 45/JDK\ 8\ Update\ 45.pkg /code/pre  Then hit ENTER and enter your password.  You should get output that tells you exactly what is happening.  precodeinstaller:PHASE:Preparing for installation… installer:PHASE:Preparing the disk… installer:PHASE:Preparing JDK 8 Update 45… installer:PHASE:Waiting for other installations to complete… installer:PHASE:Configuring the installation… installer:STATUS: installer:%5.810995 installer:PHASE:Writing files… installer:%7.044070 installer:PHASE:Writing files… ... ... ... installer:%79.565404 installer:PHASE:Moving items into place… installer:%80.175556 installer:PHASE:Moving items into place… ... ... ... installer:PHASE:Running package scripts… installer:PHASE:Running package scripts… ... ... ... installer:PHASE:Validating packages… installer:%97.750000 installer:STATUS:Running installer actions… installer:STATUS: installer:PHASE:Finishing the Installation… installer:STATUS: installer:%100.000000 installer:PHASE:The software was successfully installed. installer: The upgrade was successful. /code/pre  If it is failing at some point it should tell you.

This is the reason why you only got the /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin  <comment218754> Try `/usr/libexec/java_home -V` in a Terminal and tell us what it gives you back. <comment218773> % /usr/libexec/java_home -V     Matching Java Virtual Machines (3):         1.7.0_51, x86_64: "Java SE 7" /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home         1.6.0_65-b14-462, x86_64: "Java SE 6" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home         1.6.0_65-b14-462, i386: "Java SE 6" /System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home      /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home <comment218774> The update tab of the Java control panel insists that Java 8 Update 45 is installed. <comment218776> Added the java_home output to your question. Hope you don't mind.

I just downloaded and installed Java 1.8 yesterday and installed it with all the defaults and it deposited it within that folder. <comment218845> I'm trying to install the JDK <comment222249> Alistair - Java 1.8 does not appear anywhere. Now, after repeated attempts to install it, the Java 1.8 installer is failing.  Is there any I can back out all the versions of Java and start over from scratch?  Is there anyway to  install Java 1.8 manually? <comment222250> Here is the log from the installer: <comment222251> Paste the log from the install into a http://gist.github.com and paste the link here in a comment or update your question. <comment222513> Alistair - I have updated my question with the entire log <comment314108> Alistair - I just got back to this (after more than a year). I ended up trashing the Mac to the point I had to do a complete restore from Time Machine. So I basically started from scratch and 1.8 installed. <comment343437> I'm not convinced the OP had the same issue as you: part of their install/update log reads "An error occurred while running scripts from the package “JDK 8 Update 45.pkg”. <comment343440> But the last bit ofg the log says javaappletplugin.pkg <comment343454> Both JRE and JDK will install the JavaAppletPlugin.pkg -- PackageKit: packages=("PKLeopardPackage file://localhost/Volumes/JDK 8 Update 121/JDK 8 Update 121.pkg#jdk180121.pkg", "PKLeopardPackage file://localhost/Volumes/JDK 8 Update 121/JDK 8 Update 121.pkg#javaappletplugin.pkg")
