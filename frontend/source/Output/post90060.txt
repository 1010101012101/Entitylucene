Mac Reminders App window not visible <body> Im using a Macbook Pro retina display running OS X 10.8.3  When the reminders app is launched, the app is active and it shows up on the status bar, but the window is not visible. There's only an outline, which i'm guessing is the default shadow seen for any window opened up OS wide.  When logged in using a guest user profile there's no problem. I've tried repairing permissions, cleared caches using third party softwares (CleanmyMac, OnyX) but the problem still persists. Any ideas?
