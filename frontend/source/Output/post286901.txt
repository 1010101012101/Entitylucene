Fastest way to enabling screen mirroring on Sierra with the touch strip <body> People,  The classical codeCommand + F1/code does not work to do screen mirroring macs with the touch bar running Sierra.  Also, although in the System Preferences I have "Show mirroring options..." enabled, the option still does not appear in the menu when I'm connected to an external screen with VGA.   Thus I have to every time go through: codeOpen System Preferences -&gt; Select Display -&gt; Select Arrangement -&gt; Click on Checkbox/code. This is horrible.   In the absence of the old shortcut, what's the fastest way to enable mirroring?  <answer286902> Have you tried codeCommandâ€“Brightness Down/code?  Similar question is here  <answer287110> Just for reference here.  Another thing that I tried, and which (depending on your touch-bar configuration) could be even faster than the codeCommand-Decrease Brightness/code shortcut is a menu-bar app called Display Menu:   https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/display-menu/id549083868?mt=12  <comment362300> ah. this does work. it still is a bit too tedious since the brightness down button is not always visible. so you have first to expand the action buttons, and then it works with Command-Brightness-Down. good call.
