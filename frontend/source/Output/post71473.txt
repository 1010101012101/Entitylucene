How do I do 6-key Braille input? <body> Does Mac OS X have a facility for 6 key (Perkins) Braille typing? That is using kbdF/kbd, kbdD/kbd, kbdS/kbd, kbdJ/kbd, kbdF/kbd &amp; kbdL/kbd to type in the various Braille cells (mapping respectively to kbd⠁/kbd, kbd⠂/kbd, kbd⠄/kbd, kbd⠈/kbd, kbd⠐/kbd&amp; kbd⠠/kbd) on the keyboard. I don't want to have to use the character palette as that would really slow me down. If OS X doesn't have it out of the box, what 3rd party tools are good?  An answer for 8-key input is also acceptable.  <answer73096> Just recently out I think, Braille Writer for OS X:  http://ethervision.net/blog/braille-writer-mac-apple  If you have an iOS device, you there is Braille Pad.   https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/braille-pad-pro/id544696675?mt=8  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/braille-pad-student/id551373276?mt=8  <comment83043> This blog post seems to assert that you can use ControllerMate and a custom script to get the basics to work http://janrobertmenzel.de/2008/03/keyboard-braille/
