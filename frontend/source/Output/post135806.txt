Difference between Export PDF and Print to PDF in Safari <body> What is the difference between to File  Export as PDF and File  Print  Save As PDF?  <answer135835> Export as PDF is a Safari-specific feature. The print-option is system-wide. In the case of Safari you'll also have your usual print-features that you can check or uncheck here such as printing the backgrounds as well as headers and footers  <answer135849> "Save as PDF" is essentially a digital copy of what you get if you were to print a specific page from Safari. This includes extra headers/footers that include the date, webpage, number of pages, web address, etc.  "Export as PDF" is a simple snapshot of the page as is and does not include all of those extra details.   From the few pages I've compared the differences with these two options, Export as PDF tends to retain more of the formatting details whereas the Save as PDF option can cause the page to look slightly different.   <answer171473> One difference I have noticed, and it's a big one, is the page size is different in the Export as PDF rather than going to the Print and Save as PDF option.  I didn't know about this and was surprised when this happened.  It is very annoying but this is the difference I see between the two options.  Using the Save as PDF option from the PDF pulldown menu in the Print dialogue gives an A4 sized PDF if the paper size is set to A4.  Using Export As PDF gives something different, that changes according to the website thou are exporting.  <answer244462> sub(My answer below applies to Safari 9.1.1 on Yosemite.)/sub  hr  ol liUsing strongem"Print to PDF"/em/strong will apply whatever style sheet you have activated. If you are good enough with CSS to hack your own style sheet for printing, you can get the output look as you please: you can change the page sizes (even to very custom, non-standard ones), margins, font faces, font sizes, etc.  To apply the CSS you want, go to:br emPreferences... = Advanced = Style Sheet = (&lt;Other...&gt; || &lt;existing_sheet.css&gt;)/em./li liFor using strongem"Export to PDF"/em/strong I've found no way to influence the look and feel of elements on the PDF, not even page size or margins (for me it's always A4 portrait). For example, the mono font seems always to be Courier (while with the strongem"Print to PDF"/em/strong approach I could easily change it to emMenlo/em, emMonaco/em or emSource Code Pro/em via CSS).  There strongemmay/em/strong be a way to influence the strongem"Export to PDF"/em/strong outcome by using some secret emcodedefaults write com.apple.Safari .../code/em command lines, but I've not yet explored this path./li /ol  <comment161022> In what app? On what OS? Do you detect any difference if you do both operations to the same web page? <comment161054> yes but what are the specific differences? <comment301273> There is no *"Save as PDF"* (and the OP didn't ask about it). There is a *"Print to PDF"* (and the OP did ask about it, as well as about *"Export to PDF"*).
