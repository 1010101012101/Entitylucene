iPhone 4 is not recognized by PC, nor will it reset to factory settings <body> Since today, my iPhone isn't recognized by my PC anymore. I tried putting it on my laptop which doesn't recognize it either. My iPhone strongis/strong working.  I later tried to reset it to factory settings, but after an hour it still wasn't finished so I hard reset it to get it back to work.  I think that the fact that I jailbroke my iPhone a few months back has something to do with it. The version I'm running is iOS 6.1, my PC is running on Windows 7 Home Premium and my laptop is running on Windows 7 Professional. Both 64-bit  I'm not sure if I'm missing something very obvious here, but I have no clue of what I could do. If anyone has any suggestions that would be amazing, thank you.  <comment111395> Take a look at DFU mode (google it). Try connecting your device that way, and it should definitely recognize it. If it doesn't, well, good luck to you. <comment111405> Tell us what did you do to it or laptop yesterday, to make the change. Use the @Buscar to reply to me. <comment111437> @Buscar Nothing that I'm not supposed to do with it really. One day it was fine and the next day this happened. <comment111438> Give us more info...... do you get any errors when trying to connect, anything ? Is it broadcasting wifi ? Does the Bluetooth works ? Is it in Airplane mode ? <comment111439> @HelpingHand I tried putting it in DFU, but I get the same message: "USB Device Not Recognized".  Buscar I'm not getting any errors besides the Not Recognized message. Wifi, Bluetooth, 3G etc works and airplane mode is not on. <comment111455> I asked someone to look at it, according to him the connector is broken, or atleast a few bits of it. It charges, but that's it. <comment111510> Well, I didn't know that your IPhone is currently working. You should probably clarify that in your answer. I had this problem before, but my phone wouldn't boot in the first place. DFU fixed it for me. Attempt connecting to a different USB port on your computer, and if that doesn't work, a different computer. Also, you should state your computer's operating system in your question. (windows...Mac...whatever). Good luck. <comment111514> Edited my question to state those things. Honestly, I think the dock connector is broken. <comment111546> Did you try to connect with Bluetooth ? <comment111549> No working bluetooth sticks around unfortunately, I'd need to get one.
