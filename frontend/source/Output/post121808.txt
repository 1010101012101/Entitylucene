Help with my Hypochondriac Mac <body> Recently every time I restart my Mac, I get a warning message about something that went wrong during my last session. I am quite sure I made a clean shutdown and saw no errors. I even did a full disk scan with Disk Utility and got no issues.  However, no matter how much I check things up, even after two restarts in a row, my Mac keep insisting that last time there was something wrong. How can I convince my Mac (or myself) that everything is just fine?  <comment142026> What exactly is  the message <comment142067> Lets be honest here. You love your Mac, and it keeps telling you it is hurt, but you can not find out what so now you are panicking.
