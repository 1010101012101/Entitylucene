Spotlight constantly indexes MacBook Air (Lion). Takes up 50+% of cpu <body> So I noticed my Air was running very slow. Opened Activity monitor and noticed a process codemdworker/code taking up most of the space. I googled it and it seems to be related to Spotlight.  I opened Spotlight and there appears to be a progress bar along with the message that it is indexing my MacBook Air. I've let this run for ages now but it seems to be stuck at 95%. I tried restarting but I get the same thing. Force quitting codemdworker/code does nothing as it just seems to start again.  Would anyone have any ideas on how to solve this? Thanks!  <answer93684> Try to erase the Spotlight index by either running codesudo mdutil -Ea/code or by temporarily adding your startup disk to the privacy tab in the Spotlight preference pane.  If that doesn't work, try to run:  precodesudo lsof|grep mdworker /code/pre  or   precodesudo mdutil -Ea;opensnoop -n mdworker /code/pre  to see if the indexing hangs on some specific files.
