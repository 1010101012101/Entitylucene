How do I move a contact on the iPhone from one group to another? <body> I have about 20 contacts on my iPhone that is in the wrong group. How can I move them to another group?  <answer2530> You need to use your AddressBook application for that and sync the iPhone again.  There is no Group support but for reading on iOS.  ul liyou can't create groups/li liyou can't move to and from groups/li liyou can only create a contact in a group if a group exists Ôºç Windows user can edit your group through iCloud.com/contacts/li /ul  <answer10197> There are several apps that can do this, for example VisuContacts.  <answer14541> I had the same problem. I found this page looking or a solution. I wasn't satisfied with the above. So I did the following:  ul liEmail the contacts to yourself (share contact)./li liIn the contacts app, make sure you are in the proper group (for me, my gmail account with exchange)/li liImport the contact. It should be adde to the group you selected in the previous step. /li liNow go check the contact is in the correct group, and if so, delete the one in the old group./li /ul  <answer20563> it will work to email yourself the contacts but you need to be sure to first go to the settings menu/mail,contacts,calendar/look down the menu under contacts for default account and set it to exchange.  then it will save the contacts you email yourself in exchange.  <answer23066> The [ContactMover][1] iPhone app does this. [1]: http://www.immense.net/contactmover/  <answer25037> I am using a free iPhone application to manage groups of contacts. http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/easy-group/id461469079?l=fr&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=8  <answer27926> The Speed Names app will do it. How could they have missed doing this in iOS 5? All those clever people at Infinite Loop and no one wants to move a contact from one group to another? Or perhaps they have no friends?  <answer29472> ContactMover costs $4.99 and EasyGroup crashes. Though the interface is terrible, HachiContact works and is free. Oh, and it hasn't crashed on me yet.  I've been able to add groups, remove groups, and even move contacts between groups. I still don't understand why this functionality isn't built into the iPhone OS.  <answer29738> Orbicontacts worked very well for me, and it is free  <answer54174> I have been using Copytrans Contacts - the difference between this app and I would say most of the rest is that:  ul liYou can use it to add/edit/remove contact groups on your iPhone via your computer/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8yiGG.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liYou can easily move iPhone contacts between groups via drag/drop/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k5CFe.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment2228> Will the AddressBook application also work in Windows? <comment2230> The Address Book application is Mac OS X specific. On Windows use either Outlook or the Windows Address Book depending on your setup and what you have chosen to sync your contacts with (check iTunes as it should say). <comment2264> next time, make sure to add, at least the `Windows` talk so we know that you talk from a Windows perspective, as this is Apple forum, I always assume, if not mention otherwise that it's a Mac you have. <comment18963> Jason's answer works, but you need to set your default contacts group to the desired destination before importing the vcf. It's under the mail, cal, contacts settings page at the bottom of the contact options. <comment18965> [Jason's answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2529/how-do-i-move-a-contact-on-the-iphone-from-one-group-to-another/14541#14541) didn't work for me; it saved to "All Contacts." But the strategy is a good one. So, I went into the "correct" group, added a new contact and just typed the person's last name, then "added" the emailed contact to that new "abbreviated" contact. <comment33852> unbelievable that there is no out of the box function for that. <comment36494> I just used Speed Names to copy contacts from my phone to my exchange account, it worked perfectly <comment44587> This doesn't seem to do what the question is about. That app creates groups and allows texting and emailing to that group but it doesn't let you move contacts between accounts <comment44625> It also works nicely for transferring between groups that aren't synced to the PC but over the air, like two gmail accounts. And it is free. <comment182031> It looks like this iOS app has changed to become "Orbi Tools" (https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/orbicontacts/id470885623) but is no longer free, and from the 1 review does not appear to perform this functionality any longer. :-( <comment182032> There's nothing on the iOS app store named VisuContacts. <comment182034> HachiContact did not appear to let me move contacts between my "On iPhone" address book and my Gmail address book. :-( <comment263753> This is very time consuming, but to this day actually works, unlike many other answers i have found. <comment328548> In newer macOS versions, it's the `Contacts` app. If you have a Mac, this is the easier than the highest-voted answer. You can drag-and-drop multiple contacts from one account to another.
