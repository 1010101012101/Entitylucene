Validating AppleScript input text <body> How would I validate this pattern: 2 digits followed by last name, basically any length of letters.  Apple script does not use regular expressions, correct?    I need to validate user input and all student user IDs on my campus are in that format.  precoderepeat      display dialog "Enter  user name:  (like 99smith)" default answer "" giving up after 40      set {userName, returnedButton, gaveupBoolean} to the result as list     --&gt;{"some text", "OK", false}      if userName is not "" then         set CheckName to text 1 thru 2 of userName &amp; " --test"          display dialog CheckName &amp; " -- 1"          if class of CheckName is number then              display dialog CheckName &amp; " -- 2"             exit repeat         else             display dialog "Name does not start with 2 digits  " &amp; CheckName &amp; " -- " &amp; userName         end if      end if  end repeat /code/pre  <answer135632> Can you approach it like this:  Take the first two characters:  --test to see if they are numbers.br --If not return invalid.  Take the remaining characters:  --test for minimum length?  -- if not return invalid.  --test each character to see if they are numbers.  --  If any character is a number return invalid.  strongEdit to add:/strong  Rather than checking to see if codeCheckName/code is a number try converting it to a number:  precodetry     set CheckName to CheckNameDigits as number on error     display dialog CheckName &amp; " is not a number" end try /code/pre  <comment160775> Can you show us what you have tried? <comment161134> The line CLASS of CheckName is NUMBER never seems true even when check name is 2 digits <comment161160> Please see my edit below.
