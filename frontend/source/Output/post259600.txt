Super slow and erroneous Time Machine backup of late 2013 15" MBPr to USB disk on Airport Extreme (802.11n version) after Sierra update <body> Though not officially supported, I have been using a 4TB USB disk attached to an Airport Extreme (5th Gen) as a Time Machine destination for both my MacBook Pro (Retina) 15" late 2013 and for my wife's 2015 MacBook (Retina), apparently successfully.  At least I have been able to recover files from it using Time Machine in the past.  After updating my MBP to Sierra, Time Machine decided that my MBP's disk image on the backup disk was corrupt, and after I gave it permission to delete it, it started to do another full backup.  That was two weeks ago, and it has not finished.  After each time I either stop TM or just take my MBP away from home, TM wants to re-scan the entire disk.  Today, I have been running it since yesterday late afternoon (about a day ago), and the TM log says "Copied 5.22 GB of 5.22 GB, 4636864 of 5236468 items". The 4.6M number seems to increase by about 200K each hour, so I keep hoping it will eventually complete.  Last weekend, however, as it approached that state, the log said there was an I/O error writing the index, and the next TM start, it started by re-scanning everything. Is this a Sierra problem, or does anyone have ideas on how to get past it?  The other problem I see is tons of log messages of the form 2016-11-01 15:48:52.042981-0400  localhost mtmd[29033]: (TimeMachine) [com.apple.TimeMachine.TMLogError] -[FileAttrs writeAttributesToItemAtPath:] setattrlist failed for path '/.MobileBackups/Computer/2016-11-01-154845/Volume/private/var/folders/zz/zyxvpxvq6csfxvn_n0000000000000/0' (errno 1)  No clue why these are seen as errors; I assume these are temporary files that perhaps disappear by the time the indexer gets around to trying to index them.  Thank you for any solutions/clues.  <comment324813> Have you completely erased the disk? You may need to plug it directly into your computer and use disk utility.
