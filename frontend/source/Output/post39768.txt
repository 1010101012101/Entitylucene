Will the old version of Airport Utility still be usable if I upgrade to 6.0? <body> I would like to know if, once I upgrade Airport Utility to version 6.0, the old version I had previously will disappear, and I want to know if I can use both of them (old and new) on the same Mac.  <answer39769> Yes, the old version will be removed when you download the new one.  Yes, you can download the old version and use both, side by side (according to this TUAW article).
