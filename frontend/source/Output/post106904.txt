Change the icon of an applescript-called notification <body> With OSX Mavericks we now can make notifications with applescript pretty easily. However, there doesnâ€™t seem to be a way to change the icon that appears to a custom one. Is there a way to accomplish this?  <answer108558> As of the Apple Documentation codedisplay notification/code does not have a parameter to change te icon.   codeDisplay notification/code will use the icon of your script. One of your option is to change the icon of your bundle (cf screen). img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JmQ1n.png" alt="enter image description here"
