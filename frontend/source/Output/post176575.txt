Are these harmful files that were scanned on my Mac safe to delete? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5DKed.jpg" alt="Threats Found"  The scan says the threat is blocked but for more safety I'm considering removing them. Is it safe to do so since some files seem to be system files.  <answer176576> Yes, you should remove these files.br VSearch is adware for OS X.

The adware simply places files in those locations to obfuscate the actions of the adware.
