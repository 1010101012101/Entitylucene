Fill an area selected using 'Instant Alpha' with a specific color in Photos <body> In the Photos.app I am using Markup Toolbar in conjunction with screenshot editor.  How can I fill an area I selected using Instant Alpha with a specific color?  <answer197851> The Toolbar on the Preview App is handy for embasic/em editing, but more detailed work would require a proper photo editing application.  The strongPhotos/strong app provides some basic editing such as color correction and rotation.  However it does not (correct me if I am wrong) allow for working Alpha channels or layers.  There are several third party apps available on the strongMac App Store/strong that allow for fine photo editing. Pixelmator comes to mind.  If you have strongPages/strong or strongKeynote/strong installed and you just want to make it quickly you could do this.  However, this is just a quick and dirty way to get the job done.  ul liBe sure to work with a copy of your original./li liOpen strongKeynote/strong and create a new presentation. Any of the built-in templates are fine but the white is easiest to work with./li liChange the background to your fill color./li liDrag or paste in your photo.  Alternatively you can use the strongMedia/strong browser./li liUsing the strongAlpha/strong tool, remove the unwanted color(s)./li liWhen satisfied, export the slide as an Image or simply take a screenshot using kbdâŒ˜/kbd+kbdshift/kbd+kbd4/kbd/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iBIUM.png" alt="Keynote background"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jczlt.png" alt="Add Photo"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q5l5A.png" alt="Drop Picture"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/W42uy.png" alt="Alpha"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NLd18.png" alt="End result"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vtvrr.png" alt="Green banana"  <answer261727> To fill color using instant alpha:  ul liSelect the area with instant alpha./li liPress delete. If asked to save as png click yes. This makes a picture with the instant alpha areas transparent./li liSelection all (entire picture) and copy./li liPaint a rectangle of desired color over instant alpha areas./li liClick paste. This puts back in the picture with transparent instant alpha areas over the color background./li /ul  <comment236532> Welcome to Ask Different.  Are you referring to the Markup Toolbar in Preview, or are you marking up an image in Mail?  The markup is there to allow for very basic editing. <comment236539> I'm not familiar to MacBook, that was the only place I could fine a kind of Editing option, Is there any Markup Toolbar in Photos? <comment236611> Thank you so much , great information. <comment372869> @leili if you found this useful or it answers you question please mark as answered or vote up for the benefit of others.
