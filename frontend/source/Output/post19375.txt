Open Finder window from current Terminal location? <body> If I am in a specific path in a Terminal window, how can I open that same window in a new Finder window?   Note: This is the opposite of opening a Terminal from Finder.  <answer19376> Typing codeopen ./code in Terminal will open the current working directory in a Finder window.  <answer182341> h3Stretch goal!/h3  emTo expand on the answer above (because the more appropriate related question is marked as a dupe and can't recieve new answers).../em  I've added a function to my ~/.bash_profile to handle revealing a file or directory:  precode# Reveal a file or directory in Finder # ..expects only one argument # the argument is quoted to accommodate spaces in the filename reveal () {    # if the first arg is a directory    if [[ -d "$1" ]];        then            # ..use the argument directly            basedir="$1"        else            # ..we passed a file, so use its containing directory            basedir=$(dirname "$1")    fi    # basedir is a directory in now, so open will activate Finder    open "$basedir" } /code/pre  To install the function:  ul lipaste/save it into ~/.bash_profile/li licodesource ~/.bash_profile/code or open a new terminal/tab/li /ul  The context for my use is that I'll be browsing around using codels/code with tab completion, then when I find what I'm looking for, I can codereveal/code (or codecd/code or codesubl/code) the most recent arg, like:  precodels dir/subdir&lt;tab tab&gt; subsubdir  anotherdir ls dir/subdir/anotherdir reveal !$ /code/pre  <answer217849> If you have codeautojump/code installed, you don't even have to type the full path to the directory. You can simply type codejo partialdirectoryname/code, and autojump will open a new Finder window in the specified directory.  I love this method, because you don't have to remember the entire directory name. Autojump keeps a list of most commonly used locations, and automatically knows which directory you're referring to, even if you only give it part of the name.  <answer243599> Typing codeopen ./code in Terminal will open the current working directory in a Finder window. br/ But there is also an alternative version  precodeopen `pwd` /code/pre  <answer259250> precodeopen . /code/pre  As a nice addition, add an alias in .bash_profile or .bash_aliases if you have one.  precodealias finder='open' /code/pre  Then you can use codefinder ./code which I think is more intuitive.  <comment21269> Thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for. I'd seen it before, but forgot it. <comment129775> How is this done in Mavericks? <comment129776> Looks like this is broken in 10.9 Mavericks. Any workaround? <comment129871> @WolfgangFahl It still works for me in 10.9 Mavericks. <comment129872> @WolfgangFahl the `open .` technique still works for me. <comment142122> @WolfgangFahl Was your Mavericks install a fresh install or an upgrade?  My upgraded install of Mavericks lets me use this command. <comment142188> of four Mavericks installs i did the problem only happend once for an upgrade install. All otheres were fine. The problem with the upgrade install also went away after a while. Strange ... <comment227815> +1 - thanks for handy shortcut function - I prefer to call it locate - ;) <comment244107> Also working on Yosemite 10.10.5 here. <comment253428> worth noting that the only thing that this adds to `open .` is allowing us to pass a filename and get the containing directory :) <comment324299> @Allan I'm not sure you read my suggestion or understand what a bash alias is ... <comment324302> yeah, you're right, I swapped them around. fixed. <comment324305> Upvoted for the fix...plus it's a good idea. <comment348716> I do have autojump installed but I get `jo command not found`
