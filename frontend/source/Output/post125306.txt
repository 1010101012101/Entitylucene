I have a service listening on a port, how do I open the port externally? <body> I have a service that is listening on a tcp port, and it is listed with this command:  precode&gt;netstat -atp tcp | grep -i "listen" tcp4       0      0  192.168.2.5.8070       *.*                    LISTEN           tcp4       0      0  *.postgresql           *.*                    LISTEN ...and more /code/pre  but it is not accessible from other computers on the same network, and it is not listed with this command:  precode&gt;nmap 192.168.2.5 PORT     STATE SERVICE 5432/tcp open  postgresql /code/pre  (but e.g. PostgreSQL is listed).  I can access the webserver locally on codehttp://192.168.2.5:8060/code but not from other computers on the same network. How can I open the port externally?  The Firewall on codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Firewall/code is strongTurned Off/strong.  <answer125334> On MacOS X greater than 10.8, you should allow incoming connections for this application.  Within:  precodeSystem Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Firewall &gt; Firewall Options… /code/pre  click on the kbd+/kbd, and select the application to use.  <answer126833> If the file code/etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf/code exists, then you need to either remove it or edit it so that codeipfw/code does not block the traffic. Since codeipfw/code is deprecated, probably just delete the file and reboot.  <answer126922> It turns out that this issue was cased by a network problem. The two computers couldn't reach eachother. So there was no problem with the firewalls or so.  <comment146739> I have `Firewall: Off` `This computer's firewall is currently turned off. All incoming connections to this computer are allowed.` in those preferences. <comment146817> → Jonas: thank you for adding this key detail. For me it is actually unimaginable to run any OS without a basic firewall on, logging and checked :[. <comment147764> What service is it? <comment147765> It is a home made webserver. But I get the same problem with any TCP server I code. <comment147785> The usual test would be `telnet 192.168.2.5 8060` what does this show? <comment147801> OS X has at least three firewalls; have you checked the other two? `sudo pfctl -sa` will dump the state of "pf" and `sudo ipfw show` will dump the older "ipfw" firewall. See [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81421/mac-os-x-server-ignores-remote-http-connections-but-accepts-local-ones) and my answer for some examples of what the output should look like. <comment148286> @GordonDavisson care to make that a answer ?
