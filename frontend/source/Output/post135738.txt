Missing BPM information <body> I have hundreds of songs that are missing BPM information in ITunes.  How do I force ITunes to update the BPM?  Please note that deleting and re-adding songs back is not a very good option for me.  <answer135795> iTunes wonâ€™t do this itself, but I found this tool very helpful http://www.beatunes.com/itunes-automatic-bpm-detection.html  <answer139391> I can't find a way for iTunes to do it, but i have had success with BPMer  <answer236233> I found out that iTunes will update BPM information from the file.  ul liCreate a playlist in iTunes of a few songs that do not have BPM Information/li liUse any software that evaluates BPM information and writes it to the song file (I used Virtual DJ)./li liIn iTunes go to your playlist, click to select the first song, and simply press and hold the DOWN arrow./li /ul  <comment232323> Alternatively, if you're on OS X, try [BeatGauge](http://www.tagtraum.com/beatgauge.html) by the same company (that I happen to work for).
