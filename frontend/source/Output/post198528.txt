How do I switch monitor focus with the keyboard? <body> I have 2 monitors connected to my Mac.  Each monitor has multiple spaces setup, for example - monitor 1 has Desktop 1, 2 &amp; 3 and monitor 2 has Desktop 4 &amp; 5.  kbdctrl/kbd+kbd←/kbd and kbdctrl/kbd+kbd→/kbd only move between spaces on the currently focused monitor.  However, I can't find how to switch monitor focus using the keyboard.  If focus is on monitor 1, I need to point and click my mouse on monitor 2 and only then can I switch spaces on monitor 2.  Even if I switch to an application open on monitor 2 using kbdctrl/kbd+kbdtab/kbd, the monitor focus and space switching still occurs on monitor 1.  Using Yosemite.  <answer198842> fwiw, I think this question has already been asked and answered...
