How can I add a web link to Launchpad? <body> I would like to have my web apps show in Launchpad. Is there a way to do this?   I search for something like this but only found one solution, and this is a program not available in the App Store. I think there is more than one solution.  <answer293871> You can use strongScript Editor/strong and strongAppleScript/strong to create an strongAppleScript/strong emapplication/em which opens the strongURL/strong in a emnew tab/em in strongSafari/strong, as in the following example:  precodeset theURL to "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/293859/how-can-i-add-a-web-link-in-launchpad"  tell application "Safari"     tell front window         set current tab to (make new tab with properties {URL:theURL})     end tell end tell /code/pre  Change the emvalue/em of codeset theURL to "..."/code to the appropriate strongURL/strong, and then save this as an emapplication/em to the strongApplications/strong folder.  It will then be available to strongLaunchpad/strong and strongSpotlight/strong, as well as other ways and means to open any other emapplication/em.  You can also change the icon of the app, and there are instructions on the Internet on how to do that. E.g., Change the icon of a file or folder, and while it says "OS X El Capitan" on the document, nonetheless, it should work the same in other versions too. Also, if you want to go the more technical route, have a look at: Create Your Own Custom Icons in OS X 10.7.5 or Later  hr  If you use a different Browser then strongSafari/strong, the emcode/em can be modify as necessary for that particular Browser.  For Google Chrome:  precodeset theURL to "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/293859/how-can-i-add-a-web-link-in-launchpad"  tell application "Google Chrome"     tell front window         make new tab with properties {URL:theURL}     end tell end tell /code/pre  For Firefox:  precodeset theURL to "https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/293859/how-can-i-add-a-web-link-in-launchpad"  tell application "Firefox"     open location theURL end tell /code/pre  <comment370843> And what solution did you find? <comment370869> An app called fluid. But it's out App Store. <comment370871> You said, "I would like to set my web apps in my launchpad", explicitly and specifically what are you referring to as " my web apps"? <comment370874> url links like a shortcut <comment370880> It is still not totally clear what it is you are asking for, although I assumed you wanted to be able to open a Browser, e.g. Safari, to a given URL but have this show as an application in Launchpad. If that is what you're wanting to do, then my answer address that. If this is not want you want to do, then you need to add additional information to your question and be explicit and specific about what it is you are looking to do!
