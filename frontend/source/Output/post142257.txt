iPhone calendar reminder + <body> My iPhone's calendar + icon has suddenly gone gray and will not allow me to add a reminder. I read through the answers here and it was suggested to slide on calendar in all accounts. That was already done and still nothing. Any suggestions?  Im missin my reminders!!!  <answer142265> Reminders are added in the Reminders app, not the Calendar app. Use the Reminders app to create reminders.
