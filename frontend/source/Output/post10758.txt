Decrypt Keychain with Password outside of Keychain-App <body> so here is my problem:  we all know that the osx keychain is located in ~/Library/Keychains/something.keychain  now i've got this file and i know the master password for this keychain. is there a way to browse the keys in there using a external software or something? I don't want to import this keychain into my current one (if its possible).  Any ideas?  <answer10790> I use the following script to extract a password from the Keyring:  precode $ cat get_password_from_keyring  #!/bin/bash security find-generic-password -a $1 -g 2&1 | grep password | cut -d \" -f 2  /code/pre  <comment11316> Nice tool. Here is the [manpage for *security(1)*](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/security.1.html). <comment11317> What do you mean by “external software”? Something that is not *Keychain Access*? Something from a third party (not Apple)? Something that can run on a platform other than Mac OS X?
