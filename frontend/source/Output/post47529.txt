Uninstall MySQL <body> I'm trying to get a working copy of MAMP. But I once installed the MySQL server seperately, and I can't find a way to uninstall.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DmYFx.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9VuQM.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I uninstall this version of MySQL?  <answer47530> You should check the following folders:  ul li/Applications/li li/Developer/li li/Library/li li/System/Library/li li/Users/your_user/Applications/li /ul  It's bound to be in one of them!  Once you find the app, I suggest using AppZapper to completely remove it.  strongUpdated:/strong If you still can't find it open the terminal and run:  precodesudo find / -name "mysql /code/pre  If there's emany/em mysql executable in your computer it will find it  <answer47532> The answer to this superuser question and this stackoverflow question both say approximately the same thing, that you need to perform the following actions:     If you haven't yet rebooted your computer, the process could still be   running. First, reboot.      Then if MySQL is still showing up after a reboot, from the Terminal,   issue the following commands one at a time:      ul   licodesudo rm /usr/local/mysql/code /li   licodesudo rm -rf /usr/local/mysql*/code /li   licodesudo rm -rf /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/code /li   licodesudo rm -rf /Library/PreferencePanes/My*/code/li   licoderm -rf ~/Library/PreferencePanes/My*/code /li   licodesudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/mysql*/code /li   licodesudo rm -rf /Library/Receipts/MySQL*/code/li   /ul      And using your text editor of choice:      ul   liEdit code/etc/hostconfig/code and remove the line codeMYSQLCOM=-YES-/code/li   /ul      If you still cannot install or run a different version of MySQL, you might have to   issue one last command in the Terminal:      ul   licodesudo rm -rf /var/db/receipts/com.mysql.mysql*/code/li   /ul   <comment54451> Thanks, but there is no MySQL file and or folder in either of these folders. <comment54452> Have a look at this answer on superuser:  http://superuser.com/questions/129193/how-do-i-uninstall-mysql-on-mac-os-x-snow-leopard <comment54476> I've updated the answer with an additional step, try it out. <comment54509> OK, great. I was able to install a different version of MySQL. But the icon still appears in the system preferences, any thought why? <comment54517> @Michiel So you've now got two MySQL icons in System Preferences? What happens if you right click on the old icon and select `Remove "MySQL" Preference Pane`? <comment54518> Ok, this is cool :) I didn't know it was possible to manually delete the icon. I've got another MySQL installed and the icon doesn't show up in my System Preferences anymore. So, problem solved! Thanks
