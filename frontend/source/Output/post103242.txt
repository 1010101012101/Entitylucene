No GDB in the new Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode - September 2013? <body> I've recently formatted my Mac and when I reinstalled the command line tools, I installed the new  codeCommand Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode - September 2013/code. I've just typed codegdb/code in my terminal to debug one of my programs and it told me code-bash: gdb: command not found/code. There is no stronggdb/strong in these new command line tools, is there?  If it doesn't, where can I get it? How can I install it?  Is codebrew install gdb/code one choice?  <answer103250> Apple switched to clang/lldb some times ago.  You can still install gdb from brew with codebrew install gdb/code as suggested. You'll probably want to install gcc with it (you'll have to specify the exact version of codegcc/code you want, eg. codebrew install gcc47/code).  Some privileges are needed for codegdb/code to work and you'll need to code sign the binary. See instructions given by brew.  <comment121534> You need to look at lldb - Xcode 5 does not include the GNU compiler or tools <comment121536> Why the problem? clang etc are complete C compilers etc <comment121537> I have to use it for my CS classes. <comment121539> You can get gcc etc but it is complex - if doing a class I doubt the differences between compilers will matter - unless =the class provides C++ libraries but if the class says gcc then it does not aloo Macs - best to ask the teacher <comment121540> Also the answer will depend on what you are learning as it will matter how much you know already <comment123294> In other words, you can use `lldb` instead of `gdb`.
