Unable to automount nfs volume on macOS 10.12 Sierra <body> Manually I can mount a network file system (nfs) volume from a Linux server (Fedora 26) but with macOS 10.12's codeautomount/code it fails. Apparently a firewall issue, may be port 98 via codeudp/code, but so far no success.  Any ideas on firewall setting needed? Or extra parameters in codeautomount/code command file?   <comment372426> What makes you suspect the firewall? Do you see any error messages in the `system.log` regarding the mount failing? What `mount_nfs` command and options are you using? <comment372529> [NFS Manager](https://www.bresink.com/osx/NFSManager.html) might be of assistance?
