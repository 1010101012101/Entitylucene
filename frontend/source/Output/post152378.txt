Hard disk drive problem with Macbook Pro, can't see and repair it <body> I have a problem with my MacBook Pro 13'' mid 2012.  I have an external HDD and when I insert it, it doesn't appear on the desktop. If I go into Disk Utility I can see it, but it is written in light gray and I can't do either "Verify Disk" or "Repair Disk". Connecting it to a Windows PC, I see correctly the contents of the disc so it should not be a disk problem. In recent days I have had some small problems with other hard drives or USB flash drives, but they were resolved by themselves or with a simple "Repair Disk".  Does anyone know how I could fix this annoying problem? Thanks  <comment179389> More details:  *1*  How is the drive conneced?  USB?  Firewire?  *2*  Do you have problems with other disks attached through the same port?  *3*  Is the problem reproducable on another mac using the same drive.  *4*  Can you read a windows formatted disk externally at all?  *5* Is this a new problem with this drive <comment179417> 1 the drive is connected via usb. 2 No, I haven't problem with other disks attached through the same port. 3 I don't know, because I don't have another mac. 4 I tryed with some usb flash drive from Windows and they worked fine. 5 Yes, it is a new problem. I could read and write this HDD before. <comment179427> Can you select the disk in Disk Utility and use the Mount button? <comment179496> No, I can't. If I use the Mount Button it gives me an error saying that disk can't be mount, and suggest to use S.O.S. but I can't. <comment179724> Reboot with the drive connected. See if it mounts then. If not, try booting into Recovery mode, launch Disk Utility there and see if it can affect repairs. <comment180125> Didn't work :( In recovery mode I haven't the Mount button, but the "Unmount" button. Don't know why.  But I still can't do anything, no repair disk no verify disk.
