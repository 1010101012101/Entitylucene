Possible to Recover Files from Remote Volume? <body> Is there any software that will allow you to recover files from a remote volume? I have a NAS, and one of its volumes lost all its files. I can't just plug the NAS into a computer so I need to be able to do it over the network.   <answer140065> TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.  http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk  <comment165053> Can you tell us which NAS you are using? That would help us to answer your question more definitely. <comment165065> It doesn't say it will recover files from a remote volume. <comment165066> LaCie Cloudbox.
