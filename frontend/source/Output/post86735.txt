How to avoid Mountain Lion to asking for an Java installation? <body> I uninstalled java today by using this guide.  Since then I get an dialog which asks me for installing java. This happens every time after a login to my user. How can stop this request or how I can determine why I get this requests?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/smJop.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer86739> Check your login items (strongSystem Preferences → Users &amp; Groups → Login Items/strong). If it's happening on every login, it's likely you have some process that requires Java in your login items.  <answer86771> If you can't find an explanation amongst login items then you could begin with a log in as a different user, and command:   codesudo execsnoop -v/code  Then log in as the user with the Java puzzle and note the time of appearance of the dialogue.   Switch to the first user, kbdCommand/kbd-kbdC/kbd to abort the run of codeexecsnoop/code then consider the time range before the dialogue appeared.   <answer86964> My solution was described in this answer. I had this codecom.facebook.videochat.[username].plist/code file in my code~/Library/LaunchAgenst/code folder.  <comment100264> This is the same request that you get after a clean install of Mountain Lion that is free of Java. Just so you know. <comment100268> also see [Is there a way to determine what application wants Java installed?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/57898/is-there-a-way-to-determine-what-application-wants-java-installed) <comment100554> My Login Items list contains only applications which are not needed Java!
