All the dropdown menus look the same <body> A week ago suddenly every drop-down menu (or selector menu) on every browser sort of defaulted. At first I thought this was just one browser acting up but after going to other sites and other browsers I can confirm that every browser has this issue so it's very unlikely it's just a browser setting unless somehow each and every browser was changed at the same time.  In this first image the drop down should have colors on every item but all of it is blank.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIFgj.png" alt="No colors in drop down"  This one is from the amazon homepage where I know the drop down should have at least a few bolded items but none of them are.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7UHUu.png" alt="A plain amazon drop down"  Both of them have the same font and styling.  It seems that for whatever reason all my dropdowns are forcefully being changed to the system default. What would cause this as I don't remember changing any major settings?  Edit: Issue solved see comments, was just a freak accident.  <comment347899> I can't see anything wrong with your screenshots? Combo boxes can't have colour or styling? <comment347902> The issue is that these boxes were very much styled before whatever event caused it to change. I went to my windows computer and checked the 2 websites, the first one has colors on every item, and the Amazon one is formatted. This was the same on my mac laptop until just a week ago. <comment347922> Interesting, as I just visited Amazon on multiple computers using different browsers (including a Windows PC using both FireFox and IE) and I get exactly the same as you. Maybe you previously had an extension or something installed that changed the view? But as far as I can tell, what you've got is how it's _supposed_ to be. I can't replicate seeing colours or formatting in the drop-down at all. <comment347936> That is extremely strange! I don't believe I had a plugin on my browsers but I should check. By chance if you go to this webpage and click on the color dropdowns, do they show colors behind the words? This is the most extreme change between last week and this week I can think of. http://flightrising.com/main.php?p=scrying&view=morphintime <comment347941> Turns out it was in fact some sort of freak accident with all 3 browsers at once. After completely reloading all 3 browsers everything returned back to normal. Unsure how all 3 browsers somehow got messed up all at once, considering one of them I only opened just to make sure it wasn't messed up as well, but seems that was just the case. Sorry about that! <comment347963> @AtomicSteed Please add that as an answer rather than editing your question. Also if you could provide a screenshot of how it looks now that would be helpful.
