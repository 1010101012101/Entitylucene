Any shortcut to go to user account window? <body> Is there any keyboard shortcut to go here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/INc5G.png" alt="enter image description here"  EDIT: This script does not work  precodeon run {input, parameters}      (* Login menu has to be the last! *)    tell application "System Events"     tell process "SystemUIServer"       set n to number of menu bar items of menu bar 1       tell menu bar item n of menu bar 1         click         repeat with i from 1 to 10           try             if name of menu item i of front menu contains "Login Window" then               click menu item i of front menu               exit repeat             end if           end try         end repeat       end tell     end tell   end tell    return input end run /code/pre  EDIT2: I made this Automator Script (when I execute it, it works) but when I try to assign it a keyboard shortcut it does not work.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fGra0.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer243791> You will find the user accounts system preference pane here on OS X 10.11 (El Capitan): Press kbdcmd/kbdkbdshift/kbd+ G in Finder, and paste the following path:  precode /System/Library/PreferencePanes/ /code/pre  The one you´re looking for is called "Accounts.prefPane". To make it real easy to access by keyboard shortcut, you can start strongAutomator/strong, click "New" and choose "Service". Set it to em"not receive data from a application"/em, and add the Automator action strong"Open Finder objects"/strong from the "Files and folders" category. From there, browse to the path I described above and choose the "Accounts" prefpane.  Save the service, and go to System Preferences - Keyboard. Select "shortcuts", and choose "Services". From the list on the right, scroll until you see the name of the service you just made. Select it, and click in the right field to assign a new shortcut.   Run the service once from the Finder-Services menu, and now you have just made yourself a keyboard shortcut to the user accounts area in OS X. Voilá.  You can of course also make an alias to that one, or any of the other prefpanes - and even drag it to the Finder toolbar for quick access, quite handy.  <answer243835> If you are trying to bring up the Login Window via a keyboard shortcut the answer is, there is not a default keyboard shortcut to invoke the Login Window. However one can create an Automator Service which can then have a keyboard shortcut assigned to it.  The problem with that method is finding a globally responsive keyboard shortcut that will trigger without interference and work consistently regardless of what has focus when the keyboard short is triggered. In some cases it may be advantageous to use a third-party app, e.g Karabiner, to accomplish the task.  What I'm presenting here is a emcommand/em that can be executed, a number of different ways, and incorporated into an Automator Service and or an AppleScript Application, etc.  As an Automator Service, all that is required is adding a Run Shell Script emAction/em with the emcommand/em. You might also be able to use the emcommand/em in conjunction with a third-party app that can be triggered by a keyboard shortcut.  Personally, whenever applicable, I like to use an AppleScript Application because I can trigger it using Spotlight or place it on the Dock, etc. It may be a few extra keystrokes however for me it just works better and I avoid what can be problematic with trying to assign an Automator Service a global keyboard shortcut.   The emcommand/em that will invoke the Login Window is:  As a Terminal command and or a Run Shell Script emAction/em in Automator:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend /code/pre  In AppleScript the command is:  precodedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend" /code/pre  If you'd like to switch directly to a different user you can use the following emcommand/em as an example.  As a Terminal command and or a Run Shell Script emAction/em in Automator:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -switchToUserID 502 /code/pre  In AppleScript the command is:  precodedo shell script "/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\\ Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -switchToUserID 502" /code/pre  My primary login User ID (code$UID/code) is code501/code and I have a Test Account which has a code$UID/code of code502/code. So the above emcommand/em enables me to invoke Fast User Switching to my Test Account using Spotlight (Command-Space) and the AppleScript app named TA.app. It is the top hit in Spotlight so if I type kbdCommand/kbd-kbdSpace/kbd-kbdT/kbd-kbdA/kbd-kbdEnter/kbd I get my Test Account Login Window quickly and easily.  So with the emcommands/em provided, you should be able to utilize what's appropriate to your needs/wants to emcode/em with in a much easier way then the code you've shown in your question.  Note: Make note of the double-backslash in the AppleScript codedo shell script/code command line to escape the space in the shell command line vs. the single-backslash as a normal command in Terminal.  <comment300276> You have to use "Ventana de.." instead of "Login Window" in the script <comment300278> @klanomath still not working <comment300344> This answer doesn't address the question. It's about getting to Login Window and not about opening the user prefpane.
