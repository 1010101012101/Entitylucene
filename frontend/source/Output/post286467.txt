Rename Mission Control Desktop (2017) <body> There are few cool things Apple lets us do.  ol listrongemApp fullscreen/em/strong causes 'Desktop N' in Control panel to rename mission, from 'Desktop N' to 'App-name': using Dock, easy to use that App-name app as desktop cover, to work over or hide things under (until emApp-name tag-along apps/em get their Dock icons clicked so they reappear on top of fullscreen App-name window). Nice mission-docking interaction!/li listrongemMost recent/em/strong 'Desktop N' or 'App-name' mission strongemmay/em/strong automatically move over one mission right of leftmost 'Desktop 1' mission. Except, when more than one app acquires a dedicated mission: then it still gets its own mission name, embut it no longer scoots over where it is easy to find, stays where it is in the Control panel: flakey/em. Perhaps intentional: throw up more than one Appname mission, and you are serious information worker, strongemdon't move my tags/em/strong!/li listrongemReposition desktops/em/strong in Mission Control by dragging them to any order in Control panel. Of course if you have a dozen Mail missions, they all get the same Mail mission tag name, which looks like confusion-by-design. Also that far-left 'Desktop 1' mission, even when moved far-right, remains 'Desktop 1' if there is no other 'Desktop N' to remunerate with. /li listrongemif you open more than one mission/em/strong for Finder, that first 'Finder' mission loses the bland 'Finder' tag, as all missions adopt the name of the parent Finder folder. Important, like flakey emautomatic re-sorts/em: another strongemDECENT feature enhancement/em/strong that benefits heavier workflows./li /ol  I wonder if Mission Control applet is ready for anti-confusion strongTerminal tweaks/strong. Since TotalSpaces and Hyperspaces have dived out of view post SIP, how about modern apps, or simple Mac tweaks to enhance Mission Control. For example, HyperDock app in App Store juices up mission-docking interaction, but it is a full screen height away from the heart of this matter! Those strongem4 nice Mission Control features/em/strong and strongemtwo extended features/em/strong (6 features total) are fundamental now, begging for enhancement we ask about now...   strongQuery/strong here could be answered by two related questions. Please, no SIP crashers:  precode1. **Can we rename mission without fullscreen apps?** 2. **Can we rename mission replacing an 'App-name'?** /code/pre  (just 'coding' text so letters and ideas line up)  <comment361415> I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because open ended hypothetical questions should be avoided as described in the [Help Center](https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) <comment361430> Issues are well laid out here for coders and tweakers, Allan.
