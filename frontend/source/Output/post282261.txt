Can't update iPhone 5S to the last iOS version (Verifying update) <body> I am trying to install the latest iOS version (iOS 10.3.1) on my iPhone 5S. I've already downloaded it, I just need to install it. However, when tapping on "Install Now", it keeps saying "verifying update...", and so I cannot proceed further (I need to brutally reset my phone).  Can somebody help me fixing this issue?  <comment355475> For how long have you been trying? The problem may not be at your end, so trying again later often works. Also, have you tried rebooting your phone? <comment355550> I have been having issues for longer than two weeks, but I finally solved the problem my updating via iTunes.
