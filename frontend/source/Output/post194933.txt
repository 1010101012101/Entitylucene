Macbook Pro Yosemite l Bootcamp Issue <body> So for whatever reason, I am having a difficult time strongSAVING/strong the Windows Support Software.  I tried restarting the process, but it didn't seem to go anywhere.  My bootcamp appears to be stuck on this step, and I am not sure why. Any suggestions?  <answer194939> If the Windows Support Software from the Boot Camp Assistant is not downloading and/or returns an error, you can download the software manually for the machine depending on the year/make of your Macbook, iMac, or Mac Pro.  This list can be found on the Apple KBase.  Based on you having a Mid-2012 13" MacBook, you would be looking for one of the following downloads:  Windows 7/8 64-bit (BC Support Software v5)br Windows 7 32-bit (BC Support Software v4)  Follow the instructions on the KBase article for installing the support software, and build your Win7 disk with the Support Software box unchecked in BCA.  <comment232642> What type of Macbook do you have? (Year AND model) What error messages was BCA giving you? <comment232643> It's a mid 2012 Macbook Pro  2.5Ghz Intel Core i5  8 Gigs of ram  As for the Error, there isn't one.  It just seems stuck on Saving windows support software <comment232645> Oh, and it's a 13 inch! <comment232650> Installing Windows 8 or 7? <comment232655> I'm installing Windows 7, however it shouldn't matter as I am having issues with the support software, as opposed to the OS itself.
