Multiple monitors get mixed up <body> I am on OSX Lion, with a MacBook Pro. I am using the DisplayPort for an external monitor and two USB Diamond BVU195 for two extra monitors. Each time when I turn my computer on, the two monitors get mixed up/reversed - so instead of going from left to right, like this:  precodeMBP Screen  |  BVU195 - 1  |  DisplayPort  |  BVU195 - 2 /code/pre  It shows up strongwrong/strong like this:  precodeMBP Screen  |  BVU195 - 2  |  DisplayPort  |  BVU195 - 1 /code/pre  It is easily fixable by going to System Preferences and reversing them, but next reboot, they are mixed up again.
