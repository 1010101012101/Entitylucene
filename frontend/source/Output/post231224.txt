How to have GNU's date in OS X? <body> I do codebrew search date/code unsuccessfully.  I have codecoreutils/code in my system.  I could not find GNU date anywhere.   hr  How can you have GNU date in OS X?  <answer231227> The codegdate/code binary from coreutils should be the gnu date program:  precode$ gdate --version date (GNU coreutils) 8.25 Copyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Sorry if my answer on how to get gnu date isn't really what you seek. <comment282337> @Masi It's not clear what you're trying to do. You might need to step back - do some research or hit us up in [chat] Mark, Patrix, and a good handful of others are really astute on getting to the nub and offering solutions. Hard to tell what's next from my read on the question. <comment282339> Hmm - with that PATH - if you close out all shells and log out, does a new shell on subsequent log in have the same path or are you modifying things on the go in an existing shell? Probable need to get into chat for some details on which shell, etc... <comment282341> The other problem is expanded here http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/231228/15504
