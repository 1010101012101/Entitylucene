iCloud photos don't show up in any editor <body> I am new to MacOS (Sierra). I used iOS and iCloud photos for quite a long time now but I wonder why I cannot open any photo from iCloud photo stream in an editor like Pixlr to edit it directly. I know the workaround but I wanted to know if this is intended and maybe if there is a setting that I missed so far.  I'd like to open photos from my photo stream directly in any editor and program.  <answer259279> Open up Pixlr, and when you go to 'open', in your sidebar you should have a Media / Photos option.  If you click that it'll show your albums etc.  See the screenshot...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zlK5d.jpg" alt="Media/Photos dialog"  <comment324347> (iCloud) Photo Stream and iCloud Photos/iCloud Photo Library are two totally separate things. Which are you referring to? <comment324480> I guess I am referring to the photo stream, the place where all my photos show up that I made e.g. with iPhone etc. <comment324481> That's true, didn't see that entry - just the "Pictures" folder.
