Remove 3D shadow on vertical Dock in Yosemite <body> I have an 11" Macbook Air + Yosemite with vertical dock.  The dock causes a large irritating shadow over any windows... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tnPPn.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have tried these (found on various sites - reference Mavericks):  precodedefaults write com.apple.dock hide-mirror -bool true; killall Dock defaults write com.apple.dock showshadow -bool NO; killall Dock defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES; killall Dock /code/pre  The shadow remains after running all of these.  Is it possible to remove the shadow? (I do not want to disable any other effect - only the dock shadow).  Thanks  <answer151985> Have you tried TinkerTool? It covers many such tweaks (although I have not checked for this one).  <answer154375> I'm trying out cDock, and so far it seems to do the job.  <comment178896> Thanks I downloaded it - can't see any dock shadow settings <comment181682> Thanks - it's not clear how I would remove the shadow only? I'm happy otherwise with how it looks. <comment267542> I want to do the same like the creator of this question and I downloaded cDock. First it doesn't want to do its thing unless you deactivate Apple's new "rootless" feature which prevents system changes. But apart from that, I didn't find anything in the app that would let me change that shadow? <comment267543> I want to do the same but also didn't find anything yet. Did you find a solution in the meantime? <comment267614> No but the shadow seems less heavy in El Capitan <comment268707> for me it is still too much. I hope there will be a way to change it in the future. Till then all my windows need a "safe distance" to the dock ;-)
