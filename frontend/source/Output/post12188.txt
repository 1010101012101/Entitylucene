How do I create files in Finder without Terminal? <body> On windows, when you right click then you have option to create files.  I want to do that too on Mac, how can I do that strongwithout terminal/strong?  <answer12189> I myself Always used TextEdit for this job, open TextEdit and save blank page with desire extension in desire location.  Also you can use nufile (I didn't test myself)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qf5tw.png" alt="enter image description here"  Or use some applescript.  <answer12193> This is probably a bit out of scope, but with Quicksliver you can create new text files quite easy.  Open Quicksilver with the keyboard shortcut, press period code./code, type some text (or not), switch to the actions and select "Create file...".  And Quicksilver is a very handy tool in general.  <answer12195> What is the intention of creating an empty file? To open it? Then why not simply open the app in the first place?  But, If you want to have a couple of files ready to get something started, you can make them, and then use codeGet Info/code on them and set the codeStationary Pad/code option. If you then double-click such a file, the app will start with an emuntitled copy/em of that stationary file.  If you have a few of those stationaries, you can put them in a folder or in the dock for easy access.  If you want to create empty files for another purpose, let us know...  <answer12198> There is a workaround using strongAutomator/strong and Applescript. I tried it out; it works. The only shortcoming is, that you have to click on a file in the folder in order to execute the script.  strongHow to create the service/strong  Launching Automator and select codeService/code. In the Automator main window at the top right, set the codeService Receives Selected/code drop-down to `Files or Folders. Drag the following actions into the work area:  ul liRun AppleScript (in the Utilities section of the library on the left panel). /li /ul  Copy and paste the following script into the code box and compile the code clicking the hammer icon.  precodeon run {input, parameters}   tell application "Finder"     set currentPath to insertion location as text     set x to POSIX path of currentPath   end tell   return x end run /code/pre  Below that block, insert a new object codeSet Value of a Variable/code (in the Utilities section). Click the codeVariable/code drop-down and create a new variable calling it codeCurrentFolder/code.  Then, add a codeNew Text File/code action (from the codeText/code section of the Actions library). Drag the variable you just created (CurrentFolder) from the Variable panel at the bottom of the Automator window to the codeWhere/code section of the New Text File action.  Click the New Text File's codeOptions/code button and select codeShow This Action When the Workflow Runs/code. This will allow you to specify the name of new files.  Save the service and give it a name (e.g. emCreate New File/em).   Try it out in Finder going to the folder where you want to create a new file. Control-click on an existing file within that folder and select codeCreate New File from the Services/code submenu. A dialog appears asking for a filename. Insert a name with file extension and click codeContinue/code. The new file should be there.

I don't think contextual items work in 10.6. This program didn't work for me, and I recall the Finder SVN plugin also cannot work in 10.6. <comment12714> possible duplicate of [Create new file from contextual menu](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/2589/create-new-file-from-contextual-menu) <comment323246> Spoken like someone who has never used the Terminal.  There can be plenty of reasons to make empty files. <comment323247> Or with Alfred, or with BetterTouchTool.
