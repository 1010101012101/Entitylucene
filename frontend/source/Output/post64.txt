Is there a quick way to lock my Mac? <body> On Windows you can hit the keys kbdWindows/kbd+kbdL/kbd to lock your computer if you step away.  I don't want to have to remember if sleep currently asks for a password, if there is a time out where my screen isn't locked during a short period. Even with Lion supporting resume of many apps, I don't want to log out.   I do want to be sure data is secure when stepping out for lunch or a smoke break.  <answer68> If you enable screen locking within the screen saver pref pane you can put the computer to sleep and lock at the same time by pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdF12/kbd  <answer69> kbd&#x21E7;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbdQ/kbd will perform a "quick logout."  Another option is to enable a password when waking from sleep or screen saver and adding a hot corner for one or the other. Then locking is as simple as tossing a mouse in a corner.  <answer70> Via the Expose system preferences panel you can set a "hot corner" of your monitor that activates your screen saver. Say you set the Bottom Left corner, as soon as you move your mouse there the screen saver will invoke. If you've set a password on it, bingo, done.  Yet another option is to enable Fast User Switching in the Login Options pane of the Accounts preferences panel. This puts a Users menu in the top right hand corner, from which you can quickly choose "Login Window...". This kicks you to the login screen, requiring a password to move away from, and also does not end your session/quit any running apps.  <answer77> Your Mac can ask your password after it wakes up if you set it to do so in the Preferences panel (Security). From there on, you can use kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd&#x23CF;/kbd to put your Mac to sleep. So all you have to do is hit that and walk away.  <answer80> kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⏏/kbd puts the display (only the display, not the whole computer) to sleep and will then prompt you for a password if you have enabled codeRequire password [amount of time] after sleep or screen saver begins/code under codeSystem Preferences &gt; Security/code.  If your Mac does not have an kbd&#x23CF;/kbd (eject) key, you can use kbd⇧/kbd+kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌽/kbd (power).  <answer116> From my answer in Super User.  Using Keychain Access's Lock Screen menubar.  Activate it here, in emKeychain Access.app/em's Preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGRis.png" alt="keychain preference"  Then lock.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/V2g3a.png" alt="keychain menubar"  <answer121> If you want to be able to remote control your Mac (with Synergy or something similar) even when it's locked, I'd recommend you to show the Keychain Status in the Menu Bar. You do that as follows:  ol liLaunch the application codeKeychain Access/code/li liPress code⌘,/code to open up the Preferences window/li liTick the codeShow Status in Menu Bar/code check box/li liClick the newly appeared lock icon in the menu bar/li liClick codeLock Screen/code to lock the screen/li /ol  This will lock the screen with a login window, but still make the Mac possible to remote control. If you don't need to remote control the Mac, MacLoc is a simple and effective solution.  <answer216> With the track pad, you can configure gestures for locking your mac. I do it with a four finger swipe left. To confiugre this, you need a (free) tool like the BetterTouchTool.  <answer14797> Deskshade does exactly what you are asking.

I keep Lock configured as kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd but you can specify whatever you want.  SizzlingKeys has a paid upgrade, but the Lock shortcut is configurable using the free version.  <answer25613> The Lock Screen 2 app is a great little tool to make locking and unlocking much more adaptable. It is for sale on the app store priced below $5 lately.   The promo video is quite entertaining even though it doesn't promote the ease of assigning a custom key command to engage a screen lock.  <answer28774> Another program that can allow you to quickly lock your screen is Padlock. Note that the aforelinked  Macworld review of Padlock also gives a comprehensive review of other solutions (many of which were discussed above) for locking your Mac.  <answer39941> Use a keyboard shortcut and use Automator to make a screen lock service. This will allow you to set any keyboard command you would like to lock or start a screen saver on your mac. As referenced below is a nice article on how to do the process.   Handy screen locking tips for Mac     If mousing to part of the screen isn’t your thing, you can use the keyboard to lock the screen, but it takes Automator (or a third-party application, but Automator is the better bet if you’re using OS X 10.6). Launch Automator and create a new service.      Tell the new service that it receives “no input” (rather than the default of “text”). The default is also for “any application”, make sure to keep this set. Next, drag the Start Screen Saver action from the Utilities action group to the workflow. Finally, save the service and give it a name, such as Start Screensaver. Go back to Keyboard Shortcuts in the Keyboard section of System Preferences and look in the Services group. Scroll down to the General section and you will see the newly created Start Screensaver service is enabled. Click in the whitespace to the far right of this entry and a new entry box will appear. Type the keyboard shortcut, such as CTRL-OPT-L.      Exit System Preferences.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkBbb.png" alt="Mac keyboard preferences"      You will now be able to hit CTRL-OPT-L and activate the screen saver in order to lock the screen. If you wish to return to the login window instead (you are still logged in, but the computer is locked) rather than activate the screensaver, change the Automator service to Run Shell Script instead of Start Screen Saver and have it run the following command:  precode/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu\ Extras/user.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend /code/pre   <answer52951> FTW!  A keyboard short cut to launch screen saver which you can configure with a password lock.  All free.  Follow the link for better explanation and screens.  I have been using quicksilver to launch the screensaver which works nicely as well.  http://leafraker.com/2007/09/14/start-the-screen-saver-with-quicksilver/     The only thing left to do is to define a keyboard trigger. I’m using   “Shift/Control/Command-L” as my trigger.      This key combination may sound a bit awkward at first, but I’m using   “Shift/Control/Command” for all my Quicksilver trigger. The nice thing   about this combination is that it rarely cause conflicts with other   keyboard shortcuts, and once you are used to this combination it’s   really not this bad. So in this case I combined it with the letter   “L”, for “Lock”.   <answer69285> You guys should check out QuickLock to lock your Mac with.

A nod to Windows' three finger salute - kbd⌘/kbd+kbd⌃/kbd+kbd⌫/kbd gives you quick access to screensaver (set a password on the and your done) - terminal or activity monitor.

Like this one : https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/lock-me-now/id464265594?l=en&amp;mt=12  Or this : http://www.knocktounlock.com [Lock and unlock your Mac with your iPhone bluetooth]  <answer256638> Just hit these 3 buttons at the same time and hold shortly until you're locked:  kbdControl/kbd-kbdShift/kbd-kbdPower/kbd (kbd⏏/kbd or kbd⌽/kbd)  Works in the latest macOS Sierra.  <answer263204> Beginning with OS X Mavericks, all you need to do is press the power button of your MacBook to put it to sleep. This has the advantage of preventing you from having to close the lid to get the same effect. This will put your MacBook to sleep, however.  <comment19> That command actually quits all running programs and logs the user out, which is likely not the desired behavior.  edit: in regards to Shift+Cmd+Opt+Q <comment20> @Scottie: Come on, give me more then a few seconds. <comment21> This will logout instead of locking. Although it will still require a password to return, you lose the session. <comment22> @Jacob: You're not reading "the other option" for this. <comment54> You can also create a Keyboard Shortcut for this in the Keyboard Preference Pane once the menu item is made available! <comment55> Awesome, I'd never seen this before. <comment68> That's exactly how I do it. I am surprised that their isn't something like this "out of the box". <comment89> This isn't working for me... I have a screen saver setup and the required login when waking from a screen saver.  Did I miss something? <comment93> This one looks pretty good... how do you setup the keyboard shortcut for it though? <comment170> @longda: Go to the Keyboard Preference Pane, and go to the Keyboard Shortcuts section. Add a new Application Shortcut with the menu name of Lock Screen. (http://www.macworld.com/article/49080/2006/01/lockscreen.html) <comment177> Thanks for the link... I still can't seem to get the keyboard binding to work though.  Very sad since that link walks you through how to set it up... :T <comment178> I like it!  I think this is the closest to what I was looking for. <comment785> This will piss off anyone who uses your computer that isn't used to that configuration. <comment812> This would be individually configurable between user accounts, though, I'm assuming. If you've got multiple users using the same user account, though, then yeah you'd have to take that into consideration for sure. <comment2164> Note: This invokes sleep, which is not good if you're processing stuff in the background. <comment11513> Is there a way to access this command through the terminal or an applescript? <comment11515> @Juan There you go: http://www.mikesel.info/click-lock-your-mac/ <comment12559> I've tried the various methods listed here and on the net. Shift-Ctrl-Eject gets my vote for the easiest for people coming from Windows. <comment17603> @Chealion, @longda: can't get the keyboard shortcut to work either (OS X 10.6.7) :/ Oh well, the menu bar icon is better than nothing. <comment25231> What if you have a Mac without an optical drive and no eject button?  i.e. MBA 2011 <comment29015> I really like how this avoids the whole screensaver needing to enforce a password or a log out dialog popping up slowly to allow a cancel of a "log out" event. <comment29042> @bmike I edited the answer to summarize other options (besides a shortcut for `GCSession -suspend`). <comment29045> Much appreciated. I hope you don't mind my edits and calling attention to this answer/question. (I hope you didn't feel compelled to make this into the combined answer - you're getting the bounty for the short/sweet answer once my 20 hour waiting period to award it expires.) Thanks! <comment29062> In my opinion, that's actually the best answer ! <comment29063> And it should be noted that this is not restricted to the trackpad: you can set a shortcut for your magic mouse, normal mouse, or more simply for the keyboard. You can even configure the apple remote ! <comment29068> This is wonderful, I had no idea this existed. <comment29125> You can use your trackpad to unlock. One problem. You can't set a password yet. <comment33087> @Charles Sprayberry: Third-party software. <comment40745> @KendallHopkins shouldn't anyone using your computer be in their own account? :-) <comment60535> Best answer, hands down. <comment67866> You can also set a hot corner on your screen that will send your computer to the screen saver -- if the keyboard shortcut doesn't work for you. <comment80536> If you are in any way affiliated with this app, please mention it in the answer. <comment80675> Promotion is okay, but you need to clearly state that you are affiliated. See [our FAQs](http://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#promotion) <comment81375> To me, this looks like advertising <comment89907> @cspray - CTRL + SHIFT + POWER BUTTON <comment111107> Note that you do have a few seconds to move your mouse out of the corner without getting a password prompt. So it isn't as instantly as the original poster asked. <comment119564> There is a problem with shortcut for KeyChain Access Lock Screen - it requires focus to be in menu bar (shortcut: control+F8), which means more buttons to be pressed. <comment137069> The hot corner is a great quick way to do it. There are one or two pranksters in my office; flicking to the hot corner restricts their options to the old sticky tape on the mouse sensor trick, rather than changing acceleration curves or inverting colors etc... <comment137372> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment137412> That's neat that it works for terminal... that was another question I had asked on here too! <comment137440> Now explained my answer <comment164632> Caution! Preferring any *amount of time* will leave displays **unlocked** for at least part of that time. If the wish is for an immediate lock of displays, then the Security pane of System Preferences must be set to require a password *immediately* after sleep or screen saver begins.
