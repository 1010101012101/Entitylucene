MacBook with 10.6.8 Snow Leopard freezes after Wi-Fi connection <body> I recently switched service providers and received a new router. My phone and old Windows computer connect fine, but my MacBook freezes (rainbow wheel starts going around forever after about 2 mins of being connected). MacBook connects to Wi-Fi fine at a friend's house.  Another answer describes something similar being solved by switching off IPv6. However, System Preferences  Network  Wi-Fi  Advanced  Wi-Fi  TCP/IP  IPv6 is set to Automatically and all other options are greyed out. I tried to switch it off via directly entering command into Terminal, but it stayed set to Automatically.   Any suggestions as to why I cannot turn it off? Mac is running on 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.  <answer212620> Try turning IPv6 off embefore/em connecting to the Wi-Fi.  Turn the AirPort off, go to System Preferences, Network, AirPort, Advanced, TCP/IP, Configure IPv6: Off. Then turn the AirPort on, and everything should work fine.  <comment241742> What model is your MacBook? Can it be updated past 10.6.8 "Snow Leopard"? <comment241897> Can you be more specific than "forever"?  Have you waited five minutes?  Ten? <comment241901> What is the Terminal command you used?
