accidentally deleted /var folder <body> I accidentally moved my code/var/code folder to trash and now unable to login to mac. The only solution I found until now it to recover OS X.  I have tried to move code/var/code back to code/private/code folder in single user mod, since it is Read-only and not allowing me to perform this action.  Is there any way I can move /var folder back without re-installing codeOS X/code. I am having codeMavericks/code as OS.  <answer157552> When in single user mode you must enter the command at the begininng to make it writeable.    precode/sbin/mount -uw / /code/pre  Then move the /var folder back to /private  precodemv /Path/To/var /private/ /code/pre
