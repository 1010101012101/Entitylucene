Can I record a phone call on an iPhone? <body> Nothing more to say than "Is there an app to record the current phone call ?" :-)  <answer5250> h3Beware of legal issues./h3  You can but you'll need to jailbreak, use extra hardware (plug a mic into the headphone jack), or use 3rd party SIP software. For example, Google Voice has an iPhone app, and Google Voice supports call recording. Google Voice emdoes/em announce to both parties that it is recording the call.  <answer25971> As far as I know 3rd-party, Apple-sanctioned apps - ones you'd find in the App Store, jailbroken apps notwithstanding - do not have access to the phone beyond dialing.  In other words you won't find anything in the App Store.  <comment5330> Just for completeness you might want to include your iPhone model and iOS version, just in case. <comment5331> Actually, I don't have one yet :-) But, if the answer to this question is Yes. Then, I probably consider the investment. <comment5361> More info on the jailbreak helping this, please? I could never find any app there to do it (other than 3rd parts that need to call a number). <comment5388> Possible duplicate of http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/731/is-an-iphone-call-recorder-theoretically-possible? <comment13500> @Dori dun think it's a duplicate, but it is closely related. <comment29576> If people are going to cite jailbreaking as a "cure-all", can you please include links or relevant information in your answer? Jailbreaking, in and of itself, is not a *solution*. It simply plays the groundwork. But additional software is *always* required. That additional software is the key. Thank you.
