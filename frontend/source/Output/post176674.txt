How do I regain access to Font Book? It opens, hangs, then requires Force Quit <body> I just purchased a new MacBook Pro and migrated everything over from the old one. I had imagined that it was the old one that was preventing me from being able use Font Book (codeFont Book.app/code); it’s not that.  When I attempt to open it on the new machine, looks like it is going to work for about five seconds, then becomes completely non–responsive, including the spinning wait cursor, until I use Force Quit.  So far I have tried deleting   ol licode~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.FontBook.plist/code,/li licode~/Library/Preferences/Saved Application State/com.apple.FontBook.savedState/code, and/li licode~/Library/Fonts/code,/li /ol  and then rebooting, but to no avail.  <answer186592> Make a backup of code/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/FontCollections/code, and then delete that folder. Most likely, it's a corrupt font collection. Then, recreate the folder, and add each one back if you really want to investigate.   Otherwise, just delete the collections and start over.  <answer209929> After upgrading to El Capitan Font Book crashed - EVERY time I launched it. Though I couldn't delete the Font Collections folder, I could remove all of the items in it. AND IT WORKED! Font Book is now as it should be. Oh Happy Day!  <answer224557> A variation of suggestions from Alistair and Kevin and the Lucas, the OP, worked for me.   This is exactly the problem I was having. From Lucas: Before the hang begins, the pane on the left briefly shows four items ... “All Fonts” then a subheading “Smart Collection.”   I force-quite Font Book, went to the FontCollections folder (Finder Go Menu, pasted ~/Library/FontCollections).   Sorting by date added, there were some from the day of the crash. I threw those four font collection into the trash, and was able to reboot Font Book without a hitch.    To be safe I should probably trash them all, but for a quick fix this got me back in business.  <comment208680> Do you have a lot of non-apple fonts added to your machine?  If so, try temporarily removing them. <comment208682> I’m not sure which one’s were which—I used to be kinda hasty about adding new ones every time I saw [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=651089408) in Wikipedia entries.  Based on their Last Modified dates, I’m assuming it’s probably only those in `~/Library/Fonts` (but not those in `/Library/Fonts` or in `/System/Library/Fonts`, right? Can I simply delete `~/Library/Fonts` temporarily? Sounds risky. <comment208687> Just move everything in ~/Library/Fonts to a folder on your desktop and restart and see if fontbook will work right <comment208993> I tried deleting the fonts in `~/Library/Fonts` and Font Book still opens, then hangs until I use Force Quit. The question is [edited accordingly](//apple.stackexchange.com/posts/176674/revisions). <comment209927> . . . and for what it’s worth, during the seconds right after I open it, but before the hang begins, the pane on the left briefly shows four items before quickly hiding the last one (it’s so fast that I had to try a couple times before I could make out what it said). There’s “All Fonts” then a subheading “Smart Collection” with one entry (“English”). The item that comes and goes is another subheading called “Collections”; it is empty. <comment220993> It worked! It was as simple as removing `~/Library/FontCollections`. Thank you :-) <comment221012> Happy to help. Glad you got it sorted. <comment282716> Font Book crashed on me while I was creating a new Smart Collection, and since then it would crash on launch. I could just delete the collection that caused the original crash and everything was OK again.
