iPad PDF reader app with seamless handwritting annotation experience <body> I am looking for an iPad app (Android app references will also be considered useful) which allows reading PDF files and annotating them with a stylus, resembling the experience I would have with a pen and a piece of paper as closely as possible.  This requires:  ol liNot enforcing to go through button clicking, context menus or popups every time I want to write something. (i.e. add annotation, accept annotation). It completely breaks the reading experience.  I don't even care if that kind of a step-based work-flow is better if you want to edit/delete the annotations. I would be happy even if deletion/edition was not allowed, a good old cross-out would be enough for me./li liThe writing experience should be snappy and responsive. I don't want lines to follow my stylus-tip as I write, like laggy comets in orbit. A good example of good behaviour in this regard is Wacom's emBamboo Write/em App/li /ol  Optionally it would be simply awesome if it was had handwritting calculator capabilities like MyScript Calculator. I am used to make calculations in the margins, when reading engineering or math-related books.  I have tried Goodreader and iAnnotate but neither of them comply with (1) or (2). Any suggestions?  <answer82212> I found it! Good notes does exactly (1) and (2)   You can write without accessing menus and browse the document at the same time by using two-finger gestures (to distinguish them from the writing itself). And writing is really snappy.  It also happens to have a great feedback system, so I added a suggestion to add a handwritting calculator.  The only missing features (for my taste) are margin cropping and automatic Dropbox synching.  <answer82258> You can do this with Adobe Reader by Adobe There is a version for Andriod too, and it is free as well.  <answer83459> I use my iPad all the time at work and during meeting, it's important to import, make annotation and share my files with people. To do this I use Beesy, really nice app, I can read my pdf files on iPad easier, it's very good tool for profesional: http://www.beesapps.com/management-productivity/import-and-read-pdf-files-on-ipad/ I saw they are on Trunk Evernote so I think it's can be interesting.

Please read questions carefully before answering. <comment95077> My bad. Sorry I am not perfect. <comment95080> No problem :) :) <comment136896> I don't think it complies with (1). <comment142082> I watched the demo, I couldn't see any annotation of PDF.
