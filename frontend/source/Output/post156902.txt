How to stop Mail.app from copying junk to Trash mailbox <body> In Mail.app (Yosemite version 10.10.1), when I mark a message as junk, Mail does two things:  ol limoves the message to my Junk mailbox/li licopies the message to my Trash mailbox/li /ol  I do not want that second behavior. When I mark a message as junk, I do not want Mail to put it in my Trash mailbox.  Why is it doing that? How can I persuade it to stop?  Additional details:  ul listrongOnly emmy/em action./strong When Mail.app itself detects that a message is junk, it simply moves it to the Junk mailbox, without copying it to Trash. It copies a junk message to Trash only when emI/em mark a message as junk./li listrongOnly on emmove/em./strong The problem happens only when the message is moved. If a message is already in the Junk mailbox and I mark it as junk, Mail.app does not copy it to trash. I suspect this is the key to the problem./li listrongNothing fancy./strong I use the standard "When Junk mail arrives, move it to the Junk mailbox" action. I am not using Custom Actions for junk mail (though I have tried that, with the same result). I am not using Rules other than that standard Junk action./li listrongMail server./strong My mail server is FastMail, which uses plain old IMAP. I have no rules on the FastMail server that would copy Junk to Trash. When FastMail detects spam, it moves the message to a separate mailbox (not my Junk mailbox), and the message does not appear in my Trash./li /ul  <comment184510> Could you please make sure that you are using a junk mailbox from the server… "Mailbox" menu  "Use this mailbox for" prior to last item… I am pretty sure in Mail  Preferences  Accounts settings that the both "Move & Store deleted messages to the Trash mailbox / on the server" is checked. Therefore when Mail recognize a message as Junk it is deleted directly from the server, but when you mark it's copied to a mailbox   on your Mac and moved to the server Trash mailbox. <comment184516> I do have a Junk mailbox from the server set as "Use this mailbox for Junk". I think you're right about what's happening. It appears as if, when I mark a message, the move is done not as a single move operation, but as copy+delete. If that's the case, I don't see how to solve this, given that I definitely want to store deleted messages in the server's Trash. <comment184518> If you right click on one of the server mailbox you can check that you do have the junk icon next to the junk mailbox… You may also check if the problem is not server sided by signing into the server webmail… <comment184524> The Junk mailbox does indeed have the junk icon. When I mark a message as Spam through the server's webmail, it does not copy the message to trash. <comment184528> Yeah then might be a bug :(
