How to take full-resolution screenshots on iPhone? (Getting reduced from 1242 x 2208 to 674 x 1200) <body> I've downloaded an app (that I built - I am preparing to submit) on my iPhone 6s Plus and I'm trying to prepare some screenshots for the App Store. Per documentation, the screenshots should be code1242 x 2208px/code, however when I take a screenshot and open it up on my desktop, I'm left with code674 x 1200px/code. What can I do to get the proper resolution for these screenshots?  <answer262482> strongiPhone 6s Plus/strong  Your iPhone 6s Plus has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution at 401 psi which, as you say, should produce 1242 x 2208 pixel screenshots (in portrait). I can't explain why you're getting screenshots at 674 x 1200, except that how you're transferring them to your computer may be causing the change?   If you're emailing them be sure to pick the highest quality (if prompted). Otherwise you should be able to message them to your Mac as well.   strongiOS Simulator/strong  If neither seem to work, probably the best way to generate your screenshots is to use the iOS Simulator. To do this:  ul liBuild and run your app via Xcode to the appropriate Simulator/li liEnsure the app is displayed at 100% scale (you can check this from the Window  Scale menu in Simulator)./li liTake your screenshots from within Simulator using the kbdcommand/kbdkbdS/kbd keyboard shortcut (or going to File  Save Screenshot)/li liOnce you have the screenshots you need, upload them to iTunes Connect./li /ul  NOTES:   ol liIf you're wanting to just upload one set of screenshots for the iPhone, then ensure you're using a simulator for the 5.5" iPhone./li liIf you also need to upload screenshots for the iPad and only want one set, then choose the Simulator for the 12.9" iPad./li /ol  Any questions, just ask.  <comment328828> I appreciate the detailed response, but the issue is simply that on the 5.5" model, the resolution is coming out to be `674 x 1200 px` when I open its screenshots on my computer. <comment328829> How are you taking the screenshot? <comment328832> Power+home buttons together on the device <comment328834> Hmmm, the iPhone 6s Plus has a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution at 401 ppi, so I can't explain why you're getting screenshots at 674 x 1200. How are you transferring them to your computer? Maybe something is happening through that process? <comment328853> How/where do you take the screenshots, how do you transfer them to your Mac?
