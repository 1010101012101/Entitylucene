How can I ignore conversations in Outlook 2011 for Mac? <body> Outlook for Mac 2011 does not include an "ignore conversation" feature out of the box.  Is there a way to simulate that with other functionality (e.g. categories, rules, plugins, etc)?  What I want to accomplish is to be able to flag a certain ememail/em  emsubject/em as something I'd like automatically deleted.  And to do so easily with a click or two.  Is this possible?  <answer113445> You can create rules in Outlook 2011.  You should see a rules button with purple arrows on it in the middle of your toolbar.  Or you can go to Tools-Rules...  There you can create rules (and save them to be used easily in the future) to automatically remove emails based on senders, subjects, kind, flags, etc.  Perhaps you can create a rule there that will help you delete unwanted emails.  <answer291592> After searching over the net and various forums, seems this feature is not present in the outlook on mac.  <comment133163> it takes far too many clicks to create a rule for this!  i want to easily ignore conversations right from my inbox <comment133179> @jlarson You can create a rule one time and then have it saved to apply to future emails.  I don't see another way to do it, immediately.  You could always just click delete and move on. <comment133187> "click delete and move on".  That's what I do today.  But often I'll get roped into a thread which gets a ton of back and forth and it gets very annoying to keep getting emails I don't care about.  There are several of these a day and so managing it with a custom rule is a pain.  I hope future outlook-for-mac includes ignore-conversation as a built in feature! <comment133563> In Outlook:Mac, there's a "send feedback" item under "help".  Click it and tell Microsoft that you want this feature.  Tell them why you want it and how you would use it.  Be verbose: the better of a case you make, the more likely it is that it will be considered for a future release.  "I want this feature" isn't nearly as useful as "I want this feature because â€¦". <comment161382> Not the ideal thing but you can "ignore the conversation" from webmail (Outlook via web browser), if your firm provides one. <comment303345> This needs a new rule for every conversation. Is there someway to mark any conversation as Mute/Ignore once and rest of the mails in that thread will follow the rule. <comment371779> This doesn't answer the question.
