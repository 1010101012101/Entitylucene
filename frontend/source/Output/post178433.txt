How do you disable Printer Sharing via terminal? <body> I am looking for a command/script to disable the printing sharing feature via terminal. Does anyone have any idea or know how to go about doing this?  <answer178442> Try the /usr/sbin/cupsdisable command.  precodemgagnon-mbp:~ mgagnon$ lpstat -p  printer c360 is idle.  enabled since Thu Mar 26 16:27:59 2015  mgagnon-mbp:~ mgagnon$ cupsdisable c360  mgagnon-mbp:~ mgagnon$ lpstat -p printer c360 disabled since Thu Mar 26 16:29:08 2015 -     Paused  mgagnon-mbp:~ mgagnon$ cupsenable c360  mgagnon-mbp:~ mgagnon$ lpstat -p printer c360 is idle.  enabled since Thu Mar 26 16:29:16 2015 /code/pre  <answer178488> According to codecupsctl/code's man page:  precodecupsctl --no-share-printers /code/pre  <answer272403> Use codelpstat -v/code to get the appropriate printer name, then use:  precodelpadmin -p Printer_Name -o printer-is-shared=false /code/pre  <comment211343> Doesn't that stop/start the printer entirely? Rather than just turning sharing off/on? <comment211493> Alistair, yes cupsdisable stops the printer for everyone. I should have paid closer attention to question! Thanks.
