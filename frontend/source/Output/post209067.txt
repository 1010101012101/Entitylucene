Applescript to check for the existence of a file <body> I record radio programs during the night and then run an applescript to rename the files.  I have the script working unless there is no file named that I am attempting to call and rename.  Here is my code that is working:  precodeset Yesterday to (current date) - (24 * 60 * 60) set myYesterday to (date string of Yesterday) set y to year of date myYesterday set m to month of date myYesterday set d to day of date myYesterday  set newMyYesterday to m &amp; " " &amp; d &amp; ", " &amp; y as text  set newHourOne to "Recording1 - " &amp; newMyYesterday &amp; " - Hour 1.mp3" set theFile to (POSIX file "/Users/Administrator/Recordings/Recording1.mp3") as alias  tell application "Finder"     set the name of file theFile to newHourOne end tell  set newHourTwo to "Recording2 - " &amp; newMyYesterday &amp; " - Hour 2.mp3" set theFile to (POSIX file "/Users/Administrator/Recordings/Recording2.mp3") as alias  tell application "Finder"     set the name of file theFile to newHourTwo end tell /code/pre  Can someone please show me how to check to see if the individual file ("Recording1.mp3" or "Recording2.mp3") exist before trying to rename the individual file?  Thanks!!  <answer209080> This should work:  precodeif exists file theFile then     # do stuff else     display dialog "File not found" buttons {"OK"} default button 1 end if /code/pre
