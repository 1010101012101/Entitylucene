Non-Flash Screen Recorder <body> Currently, I use Jing on my Mac OSX with my team to make a short 5 minute screen recording (with optional voice record). Unfortunately, it doesn't save it in a format that can be viewed on iPads or iPhones because it is recorded in Flash. Is there a free screen recorder out there which does the same thing but stores it in webm format?  The problem with Googling for this is that I'm finding that there's a lot of malware for Mac popping up now. Where, if you install the application, it puts adware on your Mac as well.  <answer227094> As @Tetsujin mentioned in the comment use builtin QuickTime Player. Simply choose strongFile/strong - strongNew Screen Recording.../strong or press kbd⌃ CTRL/kbd+kbd⌘ CMD/kbd+kbdn/kbd. You can record the whole screen or selected area.  <comment275839> Free screen recorder - Quicktime Player. Built-in, no ads. <comment275851> This creates a massive file and then I have to use Handbrake to convert the file, which is cumbersome to use, tedious, and slow. Got anything that uses lossy video/sound compression that reduces the file format, and makes a format that can be viewed on Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android? Would be nice if in a single tool. I'd even pay for it -- it's so important to me and my team. I just can't get something with malware/adware in it.
