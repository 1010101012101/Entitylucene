iOS MDM Monitoring Internet Search History <body> My school have asked the students to bring their iPads and use them for school purposes.  The IT technicians have installed an MDM on our iPads and I receive this message...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tSH3L.jpg" alt="General" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b9gHO.jpg" alt="MDM Profile → JAMF Manual Enrollment Payload: MDM"  Does this mean that the school can monitor my search history?  What else does it monitor?  Also, I have included some screenshots of the profiles that are installed...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K1ibb.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cwPms.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer276193> The manual enrolment payload does not by itself provide the ability to see network traffic on the device. However, that payload does provide the ability to "add/remove configuration profiles", which could add this ability. You would need to examine the contents of such profiles to find out exactly what can be viewed/controlled on the device.  <comment347541> Is there a way to see if the enrolment payload has added any configuration profiles, where do I go to see this? <comment347542> @SidS Settings → General → Profiles should list all the profiles installed on your device. <comment347555> I have included screenshots of the profile details in my original question edit... <comment347671> I would just ask the IT department at your school. My high school had basically the same program, and they said, "although we have the ability to see your personal activities, we will not because it is a violation of school policy." Note that anything you do on the school's network they CAN see. <comment347764> @NoahL so this mean outside the school network, they wouldn't be able to see?
