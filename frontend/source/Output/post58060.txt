If I save files in iCloud, where are they "really"? <body> If I save files to iCloud in apps in Mountain Lion that support such saving, where on my drive can I find these files if I want to run command line utilities on them, edit them in other programs, etc?  <answer58062> They're located at code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pap7d.png" width="451"/  Each application has its own individual folder under Mobile Documents where its documents and settings are stored.  <answer58063> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/umrpa.png" alt="enter image description here"The folder code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code seems to be the magic iCloud folder. In fact, if you open said folder in the Finder, the folder name changes to strongiCloud/strong and it gets a cloud icon rather than a standard folder icon. Pressing kbd⌘/kbdkbd↑/kbd will not return you to the code~/Library/code folder.  <comment178767> not the cleanest looking location (compared to say ~/Dropbox) :/
