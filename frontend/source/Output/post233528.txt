can't rename HD <body> My son's mac running 10.11 has the hard drive named this curie HD"""""""""""br copying and pasting reveals lots of spaces after the sequence of " characters. I can't rename the HD in Finder. Every attempt fails with "The name "Curie HD""""     " can't be used. Try using a name with fewer characters or with no punctuation marks.  Note that the applications folder also shows nothing, same with documents etc. Spotlight reveals no apps. However, Finder - Go To works.  Disk utility reports no errors.  in the shell, the HD is not visible in volumes  diskutil cs list looks like this the screen shot:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uGheX.png" alt="enter image description here"  trying as root:  precode# diskutil rename / curieHD /code/pre  get "Volume must be mounted"  I am completely stuck.   <answer233542> The FileVault volume has to be unlocked and mounted.  Then try the following:  ol liGet the device node of the falsely labeled volume:  precodediskutil list /code/pre/li liRename the device with:  precodediskutil rename /dev/diskX NewName /code/pre  with diskX: the device node found earlier (probably disk1)/li /ol  <comment285415> diskutil /dev/disk0 newname produces Volume must be mounted <comment285417> @TimRichardson The device node is with certainty **not** disk0. Depending how you booted your Mac it's probably either disk1 or disk2. Additionally you have to unlock the FileVault volume before executing `diskutil list`! You may also check `diskutil cs list`. The disk in your screenshot shows disk1 for the logical volume. This may change if you boot to Recovery Mode!
