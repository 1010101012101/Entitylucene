Can I use my iPod classic to store photos for my Canon 5D MkII? <body> I have an 80GB iPod classic. I am going on a trip and I have only the iPod, my iPhone, and my iPad. I want to use the iPod to store photos.   Is this possible?  <answer86216> Yes.  You need the discontinued "iPod" camera connector. (not to be confused with the iOS iPad camera connector)  ul lihttp://support.apple.com/kb/TA38187/li /ul  They are for sale on Amazon (and of course at local thrift shops and electronics shops worldwide).  http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Camera-Connector-iPod-White/dp/B000KIRGF4  <comment99482> I just bought one on Amazon.
