Numbers for OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 <body> I need Numbers for OS X Yosemite. When I try to install from the Apple store, it only gives the option for 4.1. I think I need 3.2.2 or around there.  When I try to install 4.1 it complains:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZThU.png" alt="enter image description here"  I cannot find any documentation or links for older versions of Numbers.  Looking for a downloadable/link for Numbers that works on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.   <answer283681> Searching Apple Support for strongiWork for OS X 10.10/strong turned up a download link for iWork 9.3 however, from what I can tell, it may just be an update installer.  But searching Apple Support is a good place to start.  In order to use the App Store version, one would have to update to OS X 10.12 or higher as noted in the OP's question.  <comment357361> Is updating your OS an option for you? <comment357382> @bjbk It is but would rather just install a compatible version of Numbers since upgrading would break a lot of things <comment357383> Understood. You may be able to find an old iWork DVD. But subsequent versions were distributed only via the App Store.
