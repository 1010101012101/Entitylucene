iCloud storage "overfull" on Mac <body> I have the free 5gb space in my iCloud storage and about 4,3gb of it was used. Then I plugged in my phone (android) and moved one 4gb file from my phone to my Mac desktop. I did not remember that the file would automatically go to iCloud when you put it to the desktop. It downloaded the file to desktop for a while but when it finished, the file was nowhere to be found but it says that iCloud storage is full and it was actually over 8gb. Where did my file go and why is the storage full even though there is no file anywhere.
