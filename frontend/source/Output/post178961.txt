How to make fullscreen app's space appear next to the current space? <body> How to make fullscreen app's space appear next to the current space?  Normally it goes to the end of the list of spaces.  <answer178974> Clicking the fullscreen icon   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3gVB.png" alt="fullscreen icon"  while pressing the alt key will put it right next to the current desktop, at least on Mavericks.  <comment212137> on 10.10(yosemite)  there  is no fullscreen icon,  and  alt clicking on the green button (which is now the fullscreen button)  does not work, I also tried cmd-clicking and shift clicking, to no effect <comment212158> I see, I didn't have Yosemite available to try at the moment.
