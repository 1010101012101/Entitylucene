Safari crash on iOS 9.2.1 <body> [Iphone 6s is what I am using]  I have already tried everything on this threat and nothing worked. Its the same problem, I open safari and whenever I try to click on the search bar on the top of the screen, the app crashes and send me back to the homepage. I am using google search engine and I have suggested search turned on and I have tried the following:  Clearing history  changing browsers  Checking for battery saving mode  tried without suggested search  restarted my iphone  None worked.....  <answer225156> It seems to be a problem these days. Did you also disable "spotlight suggestions" in Safari settings?  EDIT: Maybe a reset will do?  <answer225164> I was having the same issue. I turned off the "Search Engine Suggestion" and the "Safari Suggestions" in Settings under Safari. Try and see if that works.. It worked for me!!  <answer225165> Interesting how this seems to be affecting everybody at the same time. Just happened to me, too. Was fine 12 hours ago. Turning off spotlight suggestions fixed it.  <answer225169> The above did help temporarily however when tried switching Safari Suggestions etc back on same problem continued.  Try Settings Safari Advanced Website Data Clear all.  Once this was done I went back and turned everything else back on and Safari stopped crashing and I was able to use it as normal again.
