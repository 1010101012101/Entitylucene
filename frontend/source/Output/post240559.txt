Macbook Pro Power Consumption <body> I was wondering if it is possible first of all to get the overall power consumption for my MacBook?  And if it is possible can I get this power consumption for each peripheral running (like consumption CPU, GPU, Wifi,...)?  Have checked the activity monitor, but nothing really interesting there, except for a very vague energy impact number.  <answer240561> You can use iStat Menus to read the sensor values, which include voltage, amperage and wattage of various components in the system.                                            img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SeKSZ.png" width="288"
