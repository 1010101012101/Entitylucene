Can I remove Two-Factor Authentication Alerts from my MacBook Pro? <body> I already get two-factor authentication alerts on my iPhone and iPad. Is it possible to stop them from appearing on my MacBook Pro as well?  <comment369391> Do you want to remove 2-factor authentication from MB Pro or just the notifications? <comment369393> Just the notifications. <comment369396> Do you need them stopped or is permanently muted ok? <comment369431> If possible, I do not want to be warned on mbp.
