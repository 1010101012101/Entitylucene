Mix push/pull mail on iPhone? <body> I have an iPhone that is connected to my Exchange account (work) and Gmail account (play).  The Gmail account, sadly, does not have push functionality (boooo!).  However, the Exchange does, and that is very important to me, and so I've set the phone to "push" mail.  However, the Gmail account instead of doing the "next best thing" which would be pulling every 15m appears to now in fact never fetch mail unless I tell it to.  This is sort of annoying (it's not the end of the world, since I have the Gmail app get push notifications from Gmail, but it's annoying in that I can have zilions of undownloaded messages from gmail in my mail mail app).  So my question is: is there any way to mix push (Exchange) and pull (Gmail) methods on the iPhone? How can I get the phone to proactively download my gmail messages?  <comment124470> Have you set `Fetch` in *SettingsMail, Contacts , CalendarsFetch New DataGmail*? To set the schedule scroll down to the *Fetch* section, options are every 15 min, 30 min and hourly.
