Is it possible to access past iOS logs? <body> I know that you can get live logs from XCode, LemonJar, or codecfgutil/code, but these are all in real time.  Is there any way to access logs from before the phone was plugged into the computer?  Thanks!  <answer261489> You can redirect all logs to a file so that you can see it when needed. So you can resolve any issues come in future.

I'm looking for logs from before the phone was plugged in.
