Click track stereo mp3 file to output in stereo as well on single track <body> I have a file with metronome beat on right channel and karaoke track on left channel.  When I put it in a garageband track it plays it out mono.  The graphic clearly shows that it is in stereo form.  How do I get the channel to play it out in stereo so I can add vocal cues on another channel to pan into the right channel?
