How to check current configuration of particular keyboard shortcut? <body> macOS Sierra (but it was happening before upgrade too, so it's not Sierra specific). When I press Cmd+Up in Finder window, instead of going up one level in folder hierarchy, codeVoice Over/code kicks in and starts talking file name, column titles etc. I cannot figure out where is this configured.   Few years back I probably has configured some Voice Over feature, but I cannot find it right now. Voice Over is disabled for the system overall. I don't see Cmd+Up anywhere in the Keyboard shortcuts.   How do I check what this particular shortcut configured to right now? May be it will give me a clue how to disable this strange behavior and get back to default Finder shortcut (I have tried codeRestore Defaults/code in keyboard shortcuts btw).
