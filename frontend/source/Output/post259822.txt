Keynote - gray out previous bullets <body> In Keynote 6.6.1, how do I make the "previous" bullets become grayed-out when advancing bullets?  I know it has something to do with "Build Order" and "build out", but I don't want the bullets to completely disappear (with splashy animations) after they are no longer "current". strongRather I want them to remain visible, but in a slightly diminished form./strong  strongHow to achieve that?/strong  I used to have this nailed down, but I think the UI has changed and/or I forgot how to do this.  Kinda inverse of the animated gif found in the question here: Reveal each bullet by opacity in Keynote 6.6?  <answer259830> Ok. Found it. You just have to select "By stronghighlighted/strong bullet" instead of "By bullet" for build order.  Has nothing to do with build-strongemout/em/strong!  <comment325124> Same as http://superuser.com/questions/86185/iwork-09-keynote-is-there-is-straightforward-way-to-dim-and-highlight-each but that one is about a very old Keynote version and is on superuser instead of AskDifferent. <comment372141> nice one, +1 from me; i was in exact situation: i (thought) i had this dialed, but UI changed. your solution is essentially a keynote shortcut for a pattern that used to take quite a few manual steps.
