Ask for text, pass to terminal, in Automator <body> I am trying to create a simple Automator service to quickly change metadata on photos. I would like to be able to select x amount of files, run the service, and get a popup that asks for the f-number I want to change to:  At the moment this is set up to grab selected files in finder, and run the following terminal command:  precodeexiftool -FNumber="1.8" -overwrite_original_in_place "$@" /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Y6Ig.png" alt=""  (exiftool us an application used to edit metadata)  This command works, but the FNumber is hardcoded to 1.8. I would like to be able to dynamically specify the f-number via the "Ask for text" command. However, I don't know how I can ask for text and use the selected files as inputs at the same time. Does anyo  <answer40928> If you're not particularly bound to using Automator's "Ask for text" command, you could do this:  In your service, have the action item be "Run AppleScript" rather than "Run Shell Script"  Use this AppleScript:  precodeon run {input, parameters}     set myvar to text returned of (display dialog "What F-stop do you want to set?" default answer "1.8")     repeat with myitem in input         set myscript to "exiftool -FNumber=\"" &amp; myvar &amp; "\" -overwrite_original_in_place \"" &amp; (POSIX path of myitem) &amp; "\""         do shell script myscript     end repeat end run /code/pre  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yQttd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer40929> Oh well, I was working on doing the same thing as @Daniel.  But I was trying to only pass the exiftool command  once. So now you have a choice :-).  precode  property ExifTool : "PathTo/exiftool -FNumber=" property ExifToolOption : "-FNumber=" on run {input, parameters}     set pathList to ""     repeat with i from 1 to count of items of input         set this_item to item i of input         set pathList to pathList &amp; space &amp; "\"" &amp; (POSIX path of this_item) &amp; "\"" as string      end repeat     display dialog "Enter FNumber" default answer "" buttons {"Cancel", "OK"} default button 2     set fStop to text returned of the result     set fStop to fStop as number     do shell script ExifTool &amp; space &amp; ExifToolOption &amp; fStop &amp; space &amp; "-overwrite_original_in_place" &amp; space &amp; pathList end run /code/pre
