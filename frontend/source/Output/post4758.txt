Migration and drivers or kext programs? <body> I recently purchased a new iMac.  I used the Migration Assistant to migrate users and applications from my previous iMac to this one.  Both are x86 based, and both running Snow Leopard, so as emclose/em as possible from that perspective.  While most things came across cleanly, it seems that programs that have lower-level driver like things did not.  My ScanSnap for example did not work, and had to be reinstalled from DVD.  My PL2303-based serial port seems to need a reinstall, and I have not yet tried the blackberry software.  Is the assistant supposed to migrate kext and low-level stuff like that?  If not, is there an easy way to find out what is missing?  Should I do something different in the future with respect to migration?  <answer4761> If it was easy to find all of the system items associated with an application, Migration Assistant would've done it for you; generally, if it can't figure it out, the easiest solution is to reinstall the software that didn't come over cleanly.  There is an alternative, however: clone the entire volume with something like Carbon Copy Cloner.  This'll get all of the add-on software fine (except things like hardware-tied license keys and such), but may run into compatibility problems with the new computer.  For example, if you clone from an older system to a new one that requires a special build of the latest OS version (with new drivers &amp; such for the new hardware config), you may have to reinstall the OS (from the disc that came with the new computer) to get that to work.  Pick your poison...  <comment4663> So would that speak to installing apps by hand, and perhaps only using Migration for users? <comment4676> I'd generally say to give Migration Assistant a try, then reinstall anything that gives you trouble afterward.  While MA doesn't work for everything, it generally works well enough to be easier than just reinstalling everything.
