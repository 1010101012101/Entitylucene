User /System Permissions none.(Set to 000) <body> A previously called friend of mine (As for now, after this he is no longer called that way) was messing up with my computer without my knowledge , and ultimately he strongset the System folder permissions to be 000/strong for all files in it.  Well, as I realized everything froze and as soon as I restarted the computer it strongwon't go pass Apple screen/strong, however I'm able to run gnome on it. Is there any way I could reset the permissions for that entire folder anyhow? Or if there is not, is there any way I could extract some files on the hard drive? I'm completely desperate.  <answer127799> Boot into single user mode (hold ⌘S on boot), then enter:  precodemount -uw / chown root / chmod 1775 / exit /code/pre  This will reset the permissions for the entire drive and all its contents allowing full read and write, and may take a long time — don't interrupt it. Once you are booted back in, go to Disk Utility and do a permissions repair to set the permissions correctly per OS X.  <comment149738> Will do! I'll be back to announce how it'd go! Thanks!
