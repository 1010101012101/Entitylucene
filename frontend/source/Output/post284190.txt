Long (2m+) usb-c to usb-c cable to connect MacBook to LG Ultrafine 4K Display <body> I have a 12" MacBook and LG Ultrafine 4K Display.  It comes with a 1m cable that powers the laptop &amp; displays MacOS (at 4K) on the screen - and hooks to the USB hub.  I would like a longer version of this cable - but I can't find 4K cables that do this after a lot of searching. I'm not worried about USB data transfer speeds - but I do need power &amp; 4K display supported.  Is this technically possible and is such a cable available? If so from where?   thx
