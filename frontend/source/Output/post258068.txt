ipad2, ios 9.3.5, wrong orientation <body> My ipad 2 is in the wrong orientation. When I hold it sideways, the screen spins and thinks I'm holinding it vertically. When I spin to hold it vertically, it spins and thinks I'm holding it sideways. Toggling orientation lock to on the changing its orientation just means it's permanently sideways. I've powered it off and on again.  <comment322515> Have you not yet tried a Reset?
