Own Apple products for $1 for business? <body> I was looking for ways to save money for a small business on Apple products. While I find that Apple makes the best products, it'll be too expensive for a new business, and will most likely seek some other company.  However, I saw this... img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fR9IH.png" alt="enter image description here" ...on the Apple website.  In detail, what does "Own It" mean? I'm doubting that only $1 comes out of pocket.  <answer274448> The text indicates that you pay $1 strongat the end of the financing term/strong. So no, you pay $1 in addition to whatever agreement you sign with Apple, not $1 in total.  This is essentially a stronglease with option to buy/strong.  <comment345081> Oh, makes sense. Thanks! <comment355454> Isn't this question a shopping question? <comment355459> @William It's rather a "help me understand this financing offer from Apple" question. Which is maybe a bit unusual (as we don't get many of these) but not really off-topic per se.
