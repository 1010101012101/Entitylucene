How to remove __MACOSX folder in a list of zip files (not a single zip file)? <body> I know I can remove __MACOSX in a zip file by:  precodesudo zip -d bg1.zip "__MACOSX*" /code/pre  but I want to remove it in all zip files, I tried  precodesudo zip -d *.zip "__MACOSX*" /code/pre  but it says  precodezip warning: name not matched: __MACOSX*  zip error: Nothing to do! (bg1.zip) /code/pre  and seems stop from processing next file. How can I remove all __MACOSX in a list of zip files?  <answer242716> If all code.zip/code files are in the same directory, codecd/code to that emdirectory/em and use:  precodefor f in *.zip; do zip -d "$f" "__MACOSX*"; done /code/pre  <comment298642> Why are you using `sudo`? Is that necessary? Are all the `.zip` files in the same directory?
