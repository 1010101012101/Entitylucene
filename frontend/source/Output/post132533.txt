Bluetooth lagging when Magic Mouse and a bluetooth speaker connected <body> I'm having problems with my Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro Retina early 2013 OS X 10.9.3  It is constantly losing connection for a few seconds with my Magic Mouse and my Bluetooth speaker (Bose Soundlink Mini) occasionally even resetting the connection so I have to reconnect both.  I started having this problem just recently but it's not the speaker's fault (I've tried others) or the mouse's faultâ€”I've tried disconnecting it.  I have also tried restarting the computer, freeing some memory and so on...  Any ideas?  <answer211911> Check the battery level in your keyboard or mouse. I've found this happens consistently when the peripheral battery is running low and the device seems to start spamming the Bluetooth connection with "help I'm running out of juice" requests. Swapping out your batteries for full ones will reliably fix the issue.  <comment156956> and there are no solid walls in between, and any other BT devices that you know of trying to connect <comment208484> Hy buddy, I am with the same problem. I am 99% sure that it's the bluetooth capacity that does it. In my case, when I use only the bluetooth headphone, it's all fine, but when I connect the keyboard and mouse (bluetooth), than the sound fails/gaps/lag. A detail is that, if I change my bluetooth headphone to headset mode (which reduces the quality of sound) than I can hear the sound with no lags or gaps, but audio quality is the worst. Also, when the headset is connected, I can feel the mouse lag, a little, but can feel it. Please, if you can find some solution, share with us. Thank you. <comment349893> Thanks for your suggestion but this did not solve my issue.
