Full path to python as reported by ps <body> When I run python from the shell I for example do codepython2.7 script/code.  I later need to find this command again based on the codeps aux/code output, however this output shows a full absolute path like this:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python /code/pre  I am unsure how I can resolve codepython2.7/code to the path above. I tried to install realpath (brew install coreutils), and ran coderealpath `which python2.7`/code, however that is not giving the exact same path, it gives:  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7 /code/pre  I also tried codepython -c "import os; print os.path.realpath('/usr/bin/python2.7')"/code but that gives the same different path.  Why the difference and is there any way I can resolve to the other path ?  <answer126267> Is that what you want  ?   precode&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys &gt;&gt;&gt; sys.executable /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python /code/pre  <comment147850> How is the app started? <comment147853> @Mark From the commandline using the command I listed above: `python2.7 script` where script can be any python script. (Actually the same problem exist if I just start the python interpreter using `python2.7`) <comment147858> Thanks, this helps. I was hoping there was some non python specific solution though for going from an executable to the correct full absolute path. But your answer will probably solve my immediate issue. <comment147859> I came across the same "problem" few days back on another question : http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/125825/how-do-i-know-which-python-install-is-being-used/125829#125829 I still didn't find what exactly happens. <comment147876> @MatthieuRiegler no you issue is different - yours is a simple one of which is the first executable on the path - this is more complex as there is something internal to python <comment147878> I was talking about the "funny part", a the bottom of my answer.
