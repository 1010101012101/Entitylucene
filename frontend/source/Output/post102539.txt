Can't run postfix on Mountain Lion due to missing system_user_maps.db <body> When I start postfix, I see in code/var/log/system.log/code the following error:  codeerror: open database /etc/postfix/system_user_maps.db: No such file or directory/code  How should this file be created so that postfix can start properly?  I tried doing codetouch/code on this file, but I get the error   code postfix/cleanup[871]: warning: hash:/etc/postfix/system_user_maps is unavailable. open database /etc/postfix/system_user_maps.db: Inappropriate file type or format` /code  Is there a codepostmap/code command that sets this up?  <answer102595> I figured it out. You need to not only codetouch /etc/postfix/system_user_maps/code but also run codesudo postmap /etc/postfix/system_user_maps/code to create code/etc/postfix/system_user_maps.db/code. Then postfix will start up.  <comment120720> That's pretty much a given, considering I'm having a problem, and asking for help. <comment120734> The question is missing details (for example what have you tried), to be interesting enough for someone to spend time answering it.
