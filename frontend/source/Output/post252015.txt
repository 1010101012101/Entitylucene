Is there a way to randomize or shuffle clips in iMovie 10? <body> I've got hours of footage from a wedding reception.  I have about 100 short 5 second clips in a movie.  They are all in sequential order.  I would like to shuffle/randomize all the clips so they are in a more unexpected order.  Is there an easier way to do this than manually dragging and dropping clips around?  <answer256552> You cannot shuffle clips once added to the media library. However, you surely can shuffle the sequence in which you are adding the clips to media library.  To shuffle pics when I try to create a slideshow, I do this:  Assuming all your pics are in my_pics folder  Open Terminal, then:  precodecd my_photos  mkdir -p random  for filename in * do    cp "$filename" ./random/"$(( $RANDOM % 1000 ))_$filename" done /code/pre  This will randomize the list of photos in your mu_pics/random folder, which you can then drag into your iMovie.
