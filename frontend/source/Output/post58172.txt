Is it possible to run Mountain Lion on older hardware by using a virtualization solution? <body> I'm wondering if anyone has gotten Mountain Lion to run on any hardware in virtualization (VMware Fusion, Parallels, VirtualBox or other...). If so, it would be interesting to know how well (if at all) attempting to run the 10.8 OS on Mac hardware that normally wouldn't allow an installation of the OS.  Has anyone taken a Mountain Lion VM and run it on older hardware?  <answer60661> h110.7.x or 10.8 (Build 12A269) in VirtualBox/h1  There's an answer under How can I install Mac OS X Lion in VirtualBox, or any other type of virtual machine?.  I guess, a code.vdi/code of Mountain Lion produced in that way will be usable with at least some Macs that might not otherwise run the OS.   h2Example/h2  Physical machine:   ul liMacBookPro5,2 with 8 GB memory/li liVirtualBox 4.2.0 Beta 1./li /ul  In the VirtualBoxVM:   ul liBuild 12A269 of OS X 10.8 /li liwithout FileVault 2/li liwith Core Storage encryption of something other than the startup volume/li lidynamic_pager disabled: /li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qt1F5.png" alt="a screenshot of OS X 10.8 in VirtualBox with dynamic_pager disabled"  Alongside an answer to Why would I disable swap file in Mac OS X?, note that strongwithout/strong swap files, Activity Monitor measures both:   ul livirtual memory size/li lipage ins./li /ul  <comment67270> Would you be interested in the result of running 10.8 in a VirtualBoxVM on a 2009 Mac where the physical machine *is* capable of 10.8?

Some users might view this class of machine as old. <comment67359> Yes - ideally results for more old hardware is sought, but any information about what mix of VM and OS work - even on a new platform would be most welcome. <comment82110> Thanks for the answer. Now that I've jumped into trying Virtual Box, I'll give this a shot and let you know how things work.
