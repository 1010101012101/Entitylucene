How do you upgrade/update every package on your Mac? <body> I want a single command to update everything on my Mac command line. No more codebrew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade &amp;&amp; brew cleanup &amp;&amp; brew doctor/code and codenpm update -g/code and that complicated command to update everything in pip3. Is there an existing tool for this, or should I just use a script? Also, is this even a good idea? Is there any benefit to updating all my software individually?  For reference, this is the current function I have in my code.zshrc/code that is supposed to update everything:  precodefunction update () {   (brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade &amp;&amp; brew cleanup &amp;&amp; brew doctor) &amp;   upgrade_oh_my_zsh &amp;   npm update -g &amp;   (pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U) &amp;   (cd ~/.vim_runtime &amp;&amp; git pull --rebase) } /code/pre  <answer290723> After asking this question many places, I've refined the function to be both more comprehensive and predictable (runs the updates in serial, instead of parallel).  This is the final result in my code.zshrc/code:  precodefunction update () {   softwareupdate --install --all   (brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade &amp;&amp; brew cleanup &amp;&amp; brew doctor)   mas upgrade   npm update -g   (pip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U)   (gem update --system &amp;&amp; gem update &amp;&amp; gem cleanup)   upgrade_oh_my_zsh   (cd ~/.vim_runtime &amp;&amp; git pull --rebase) } /code/pre
