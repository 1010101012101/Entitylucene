External display not detected <body> My macbook air early 2014 (Sierra) doesn't detect my external display (Asus monitor) with the thunderbolt to HDMI adapter (my old macbook white mid-2010 can't neither). However, no problem with this adapter on a TV.  I tried wake from sleep; reset PRAM; reset SMC. I don't have a DVI or VGA adapter, so I didn't try that.  Does anyone have an idea? Thanks in advance for your help.  Here are the specifications about my Asus monitor: link  <comment329063> This might be an issue with the monitor's HDMI port.  Are you able to get any other source to display on it, such as a game console, or a DVD player? <comment329159> Hi, thanks for answering. No I don't have any other HDMI device to plug in. But the monitor is brand new...
