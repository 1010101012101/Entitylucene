iPad does not do automatic screen rotation <body> I've a problem with my iPad. After I updated to the lastest version of iOS the automatic screen rotation doesn't work anymore. I tried to restart my iPad because I supposed that it was only a system bug but it was not like I thought. How can I fix this?  <answer284006> Is rotation lock on? Open Control Center by swiping from the bottom of the screen, then tap the rotation lock icon on the top row.     If you see img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9hc13.png" width="20" in the status bar, Orientation Lock is on. To turn it off, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open the Control Center, then tap img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aeg3X.png" width="20".      If you have an iPad with a Side Switch and don't see the Rotation Lock icon in Control Center, make sure that the Side Switch is off.   If the screen doesnâ€˜t rotate on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch
