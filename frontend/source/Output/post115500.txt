Homebrew issues error while calling 'brew update' <body> I don't have much knowledge of all this so please forgive my incompetence. When I run codebrew update/code, it shows:  precodefatal: Unable to create '/usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew-science/.git/index.lock': Permission denied Error: Failed to update tap: homebrew/science Already up-to-date. /code/pre  But, when I do codesudo brew update/code, it says:  precodebash-3.2$ sudo brew update Password: Already up-to-date. /code/pre  Why does it flag the fatal warning when I run the command without codesudo/code? FYI, to provide some context I am trying to install strongOctave/strong regarding which I need to run codebrew tap homebrew/science/code.    Please let me know how should I fix this. If possible, kindly provide a link to a page/article where I can understand the reason for the warning.  <answer115508> The codeindex.lock/code file which is located in a directory which might need root permission to modify it or its files. You can change the permission of a directory using the codechmod/code command.   This is what you can do: codesudo chmod -R +w /path/to/directory/code  A good choice for codedirectory/code in this case might be code'/usr/local/Library/Taps/'/code  The -R option will recursively execute the command on sub directories and files.  The +w option will add write permission to the mentioned directory or file for everyone.  Good Luck. ;)
