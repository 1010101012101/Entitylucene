What is com.DesignScience.DSMTTool <body> Among my list of scheduled tasks is something called "com.DesignScience.DSMTTool" located at  precode/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.DesignScience.DSMTTool /code/pre  What is this? Do I need it?  <answer81685> DesignScience are the ones making MathType â€“ an application used by Microsoft Word to be able to type out complex math formulas and display them easily. If you have Microsoft Word installed on your Mac, I think that's what it is. I can't confirm this though, as I don't have MathType installed.  Edit: I'm trying to get someone from Mathematics to confirm it.br Edit 2: I was unable to get a confirmation for this, but I'm still pretty certain it belongs to MathType. Check in Word if you have MathType installed!  <comment95271> Sure enough, that's it! Some of these archaic (Windows legacy) apps leave a lot of junk around.
