Help, I can't search from the App Launcher anymore <body> I used to be able to start typing an application name in the App Launcher (codeF4/code) to filter the list. But at some point, this stopped working for some reason. I can't click the search box, nor does typing produce any characters into the search box.

Any new applications you purchase through the Mac App Store will be automatically added to Launchpad.  Be sure to back up the database file before you alter it by copying it to your Desktop or another safe location.

To do this, press the Option key and choose Library from the Go menu in the Finder, and then navigate to the /Application Support/Dock/ folder and remove the ".db" file (it will have a long string of letters and numbers as its name).
