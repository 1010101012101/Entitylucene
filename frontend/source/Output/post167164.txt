how to use Logitech Anywhere MX back/forward button on OSX Finder? <body> is there a way to use Logitech Anywhere MX's back/forward button on OSX Finder? I can use these buttons on Chrome or any other browsers succesfully, but cannot find a way to do so on Finder?  <answer213110> In the Logitech Control Center, change the assigned action for emThumb Back Button/em and emThumb Forward Button/em to Keystrokes instead of Back and Forward.  For emThumb Back Button/em, set the keystroke to strongcode⌘[/code/strong (codeCommand-[/code) and for emThumb Forward Button/em, set it to strongcode⌘]/code/strong (codeCommand-]/code).  (This keystroke combination can be seen in the Firefox emKeyboard Shortcuts/em page (currently at codeHelp &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts/code), and in the Chrome emKeyboard shortcuts/em page as well (codeHelp &gt; Keyboard shortcuts/code).  <comment195997> should be the same key command... Cmd [ or Cmd ] <comment195999> what exactly do you mean? back/forward buttons are already working as they should be on browsers, but not on Finder. How could i find a way to make these buttons work like i use them on browsers? <comment196007> so you mean you didn't set them up to be a key command in the first place, they just 'accidentally' work with browsers. I have a different Logitech mouse, btw - mine is set to key commands. <comment196078> as i install Logitech's drivers, it comes with predefined back/forward actions. I was hoping it worked in the same way for Finder, but it didn't :( <comment196230> I don't actually use Logitech's own CP - their Mac support was very poor when I first moved this mouse over to the Mac. I use [Steermouse](http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/) instead, but it's not free. <comment196427> apperantly Steermouse can be configured to work on both browsers and Finder. I also found the way of assigning keystrokes on Logitech Control Center. It should work by default as it's indicated though. Btw LCC still doesn't have driver for OSX Yosemite 10.10 <comment196487> Steer mouse can be set to 'default' or 'per app' for any app you need. I've used it for years, it's very solid. As there was no LCC when i started with this mouse & Mac, I've never used the Logitech one at all
