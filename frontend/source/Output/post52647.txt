Enter "vertical bar" (or "pipe symbol") in Windows <body> I have my MacBook late 2008 sometimes running Windows 7 via BootCamp. The keyboard has a German layout. Pretty much like the Wikimedia image below except that the blue symbols in the lowest line are not accessible.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YFAr1.png" alt="enter image description here"  emHow could I enter the vertical bar code|/code via my keyboard?/em  Unfortunately kbdRight Alt/kbd + kbd&lt;/kbd does not seem to work. (However, I can enter code@/code with kbdRight Alt/kbd + kbdQ/kbd et al. as I can do on external keyboards.)  strongUpdate2:/strong From what I can tell from the languages settings, the Windows layout is missing the kbd&lt;/kbd-key between kbdLeft Shift/kbd and kbdY/kbd. What layout would provide it?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WIqNk.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUpdate 3:/strong On a co-workers current MacBook Pro its working as expected.  I'd also be happy with some comments suggesting ways to have it entered. I'm tiered of copying it from Wikipedia every time.  <answer52651> My US English Qwerty keyboard has it as kbdShift/kbd-kbd\/kbd, with the \ key right above the Return key.   <answer52655> Try  kbdcmd/kbd + kbdShift/kbd + kbd&lt;/kbd  Re-reading your question, I looked at some standard German Keyboard layouts and you have the kbd&lt;|/kbd key in the bottom left hand corner of the layout.  The only issue you have is the right hand Alt (cmd) doesn't do anything different than the left one!  See the image to show where the keyboard is defined in Windows 7: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/45aVq.png" alt="enter image description here" Edit: added screenshot of which keyboard layout (in English unfortuantely)  <answer53389> You can get the code|/code symbol by pressing kbdalt/kbd+kbd7/kbd on a german keyboard layout.  <answer86348> I just had a similar problem with VirtualBox running Ubuntu and strongRight/strong kbdAlt/kbd+kbd7/kbd worked - whereas strongLeft/strong kbdAlt/kbd+kbd7/kbd didn't.  <answer138715> I had the same problem with the German keyboard. Press the key kbd&lt;|/kbd and kbdAlt/kbd and kbdStrg/kbd key together. It works!  You see, there is already the vertical line sign on the double arrow key if you notice clearly.  <answer179558> I have a HP laptop from the UK, after trying several combinations I finally found that kbdalt gr/kbd + kbdshift/kbd + kbd|/kbd (pipe) worked. No idea why it won't work normally in Linux!  <answer206050> I was working on Linux Mint Live on a USB I found out that its default keyboard was different when piping commands in terminal. I could guess that the tilde sign on UK qwerty keyboard is alternative for that (shift and hash sign next to ENTER key)  <answer257520> On my QWERTZ keyboard, it's the combo alt gr + w to get the |  <answer258722> my answer is alt+186 code or shift+(press key)  <answer276942> Try this in Windows:  kbdAlt/kbd + kbd1/kbdkbd2/kbdkbd4/kbd.  To clarify, press and hold the kbdAlt/kbd key and then in turn press the kbd1/kbd, kbd2/kbd and kbd4/kbd keys one by one. This should produce the | (pipe symbol) you're after.  <comment60219> What keyboard layout are you using? <comment60226> I assume you are German from your location, which keyboard exactly from the 4 keyboard layouts in the German (Germany) setup are you using in Windows? <comment61076> Unfortunately I have a German keyboard which does not this key. <comment61077> [CMD] does not change anything and so far I did not find another modifier that modified [  ] the way I wanted. <comment61078> I changed my keyboard within Parallels to a german layout, and tested this and it works, however I am using a UK Apple keyboard.  If you can please edit your question with the details asked (which exact keyboard layout you have selected in Windows) and which physical Apple Keyboard you are using <comment61079> That yields a `{` for me. <comment61082> Where is this defined in Windows? (Also see update...) <comment61083> Mh thats strange. I'll look into it when i boot bootcamp later .. <comment61084> added a screenshot to show where in Windows 7 the keyboard layouts are. <comment61086> I look there after your previous comment. When I select any layout and check the "Preview" button, the `` button between `Shift` and `Y` is always missing. Thank you anyway. <comment212879> Does it have a key next to shift that isn't Z? <comment248441> What do you recommend the OP to do to solve the problem stated in the question? <comment321616> Whats `gr` referring to here? The keys g and r? Or some meta key? <comment321719> @Ian AltGr, shown next to the right Win button on the keyboard in the question. <comment348651> Welcome to Ask Different and thank you for your answer. :) Unfortunately, short answers such as this don't really provide enough detail or context to help many users. If possible, it'd be good if you could add some more info in this answer. For example, I could interpret your answer as meaning I hold down the Alt key and then simultaneously press the 1, 2 and 4 keys? Or, I could interpret it as holding down the Alt key and then pressing in turn the 1, 2 and 4 keys? It would be good if you could edit your answer (there's an _edit_ link below it) so that it provides enough detail.
