What specifications does my iPhone 5c require to charge? <body> I'm looking into portable battery packs and I was looking into the electrical specifications of the pack. This got be thinking what current and voltage does my 5c need to charge?  <answer188695> It does not matter. As long as it is 5 Volts DC. The iPhone will choose the current by itself. I use generic 5V buck converters, like this one, to charge from my solar system.  <answer188703> Here or the specifications used by Apple's official charging cords.   5 volts  1.0 amps If your interested in making one for iPads you can use 5.1 Volts and 2.1 Amps  Source  <comment223415> most portable battery packs will say if they work for iphones <comment223416> Thanks. But I was looking for the amps and volts required as some day may build my own solar charger pack
