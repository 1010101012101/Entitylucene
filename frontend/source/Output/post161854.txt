What's netbiosd? I must block netbiosd? <body> I was asked to block netbiosd, but do not know what is. I must to block all connections from netbiosd?  <answer161856> From Apple's netbiosd man page:     netbiosd is responsible for interacting with NetBIOS networks.  netbiosd registers and defends one or more NetBIOS name, depending on the set of configured services. It also browses and scavenges names from the NetBIOS network, making them available to the system through mDNSResponder.   Simply put, no, codenetbiosd/code is a perfectly safe daemon included in OS X by Apple.  <comment189078> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81751/should-i-block-incoming-connections-from-netbiosd
