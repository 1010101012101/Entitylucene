Get components (path and filename) of POSIX filepath <body> Given:  ~/Desktop/Foo.scpt contains:  precode(POSIX path of (path to me)) as text /code/pre  Which returns:     /Users/[username]/Desktop/Foo.scpt   How do I get path code/users/[username]/Desktop//code and the file name codeFoo.scpt/code as individual pieces?  <answer101262> Just ask Finder he knows how to do it :)   precodetell application "Finder"      set parentpath to POSIX path of (parent of (path to me) as string)      set filename to name of (path to me)       display dialog parentpath      display dialog filename  end tell /code/pre  <answer101268> This should work:  precode-- This script returns the full path to the directory that this script is running in  -- get the full path to be split set pathToMe to POSIX path of (path to me as text)  -- get the path to the directory set script1 to "dirname '" &amp; pathToMe &amp; "'" set dirPath to do shell script script1  -- get the file name set script2 to "basename '" &amp; pathToMe &amp; "'" set fileName to do shell script script2  -- display the results display dialog "Directory Path: " &amp; dirPath &amp; return &amp; return &amp; "File Name: " &amp; fileName /code/pre  <answer101298> Another option is to use text item delimiters:  precodeset text item delimiters to "/" POSIX path of (path to me) text item -1 of result -- "Untitled.scpt" /code/pre  If the path can end with a slash, you can use a handler like this:  precodeon basename(x)     if x is "/" then return "/"     if item -1 of x is "/" then set x to text 1 thru -2 of x     set text item delimiters to "/"     text item -1 of x end basename  basename("/dir1/dir2/file.txt") -- "file.txt" basename("/dir1/") -- "dir1" basename("/dir1/dir2/") -- "dir2" basename("/dir1/dir2") -- "dir2" basename("/") -- "/" /code/pre  Note that codetext item delimiters/code is a property of the AppleScript object (not local to the function), but as far as I know, you don't have to restore the text item delimiters property if you don't rely on it later in the script.  <comment119249> How do you know that Finder is a "He" ? <comment166580> From his name Matthieu Riegler is French.
