It can take some to re-index.  Or you may need to force a re-indexing.  You can do this in terminal by deleting the index and rebuilding it.  This may take a while.  Go to Terminal in Utilities folder and cut/paste this into the command line:    precodesudo mdutil -E / /code/pre  <comment242508> I actually never unchecked that option. Still, I did rebuild the index (waited for the indexing to finish) but the problem is still there.
