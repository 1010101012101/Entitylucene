Macbook uses phone's mobile network when connected despite wifi <body> something quite strange happened to me yesterday evening and I'm asking other users to confirm my suspicion.  While abroad, I connected my iphone 6s via cable to my macbook. Both devices were connected to a wifi network (I'm sure it was working). After 20min of streaming a film, I received a text from my provider informing me that I'm out of romaing data volume (which was about 1GB). A look at my phone's roaming data usage reveals that I've apparently been using 20mb several times per minute.  My suspicion is that streaming a film on the macbook used the phone's 3g connection. To add further evidence to that, the Netflix offer corresponded to the one in my home country, not the one I was at using the wifi.  What do you say, is that plausible? If so, this is quite a problem that needs to be addressed by Apple.  <comment373339> Except that it shouldn't kick in when you're on roaming, i'd have said it was [WiFi Assist](https://support.apple.com/HT205296) <comment373343> Is it plausible?  Yes.  Is it an answer to what's really your question?  No.  Without knowing how you configured your networking on your Mac and how/whether tethering was configured, everything will be a guess.
