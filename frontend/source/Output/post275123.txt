Is there a way to duplicate/mirror a specific space? <body> I'm running a dual-monitor setup, and I currently put Spotify (on its own) in my right-most space on my left monitor, so that it's easy to pull up when I need to. I'd like to be able to put Spotify in the right-most space on my emother/em monitor, too. Some sort of mirroring would probably have to be involved.  Any ideas?
