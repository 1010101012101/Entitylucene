Can I rotate presentations on Keynote on my iPhone? <body> I'm prototyping an app — including custom animations, etc — on Keynote for the Mac using a custom vertical template. I want to be able to see what this feels like underneath the thumb by opening up the document on my iPhone. But the presentation is squished in landscape mode and won't open in vertical. Any tricks to solve this problem?  <comment150424> The latest version of Keynote for iOS supposedly supports portrait mode but noone can figure out how to set it.
