Sandboxing prl_disp_service to prevent disk waking <body> So there is prl_disp_service, a Parallels 7 background service that periodically wakes the internal hard drive in my Macbook Pro although it`s unmounted most of the time since I boot from an SSD I replaced the DVD drive with.  For reference: http://forum.parallels.com/showthread.php?t=114974  Is there a way to apply some sandbox-exec profile to this process so it will continue functioning normally but wonÂ´t see /dev/disk1* and do stat or something else on it that causes it to wake up?  <answer54236> Yay, I managed to sandbox prl_disp_service \o/  I put a file named prl_disp_service.sb into /Library/Sandbox/Profiles denying ioctl on disk1 (the harddisk I wanted to prevent from waking):  precode(version 1) (allow default) (debug deny) (import "system.sb") (deny file-read* file-ioctl     (regex "/dev/disk1*")) /code/pre  And edited /Library/Parallels/Parallels Service.app/Contents/Resources/ParallelsDispatcherService:    precodesandbox-exec -f /Library/Sandbox/Profiles/prl_disp_service.sb "${ParallelsDispatcherService}" -e --logfile "${LogFile}" --pidfile "${PidFile}" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;   /code/pre  <comment61446> When I'm not using Parallels, I'm stopping all it's services.
