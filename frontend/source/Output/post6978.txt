Wi-Fi auto-disconnect for iPhone? <body> Is there an app to disconnect an iPhone from a Wi-Fi router at a specific time, other than just turning off Wi-Fi?  <answer6979> You may be able to configure the router to only allow WiFi access to the iPhone during certain times of day.  This isn't a connection timeout so much as a parental control over the time of day WiFi is allowed.  The setting is located in your routers admin interface.  <comment7447> What are you trying to achieve by doing this? As Chris says,  a lot of routers have this kind of setting, so that may be your best bet.
