Dual Monitor support without external video card <body> I'm thinking about buying a MBP Retina 13".  Now I want to work at home on 2 Monitors, so the MBP will be somewhere under the table. Is it possible to connect first Monitor via HDMI and the other one via Thunderbolt/MiniDP Adapter to DVI.  <answer113752> I believe so.  See this MacRumors forum post for a user with a similar need.  Sadly, I don't have a 13" Retina MacBook to test with.  <comment133470> I'm pretty sure there are some people here at my office that are doing just that.
