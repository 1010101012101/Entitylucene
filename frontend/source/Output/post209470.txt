iMessages Compression for message history <body> Is there some way to compress messages for iMessage? My friend and I talk a lot and at the moment between all of the attachments and messages my iMessages is taking 2.5G of space on my phone.  What can I do to compress this data or back it up or something?  Thanks.  <answer209472> I think that the best way is to extract your messages and back it up manually.  strongFor example :/strong https://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/tutorials/how-to-transfer-and-backup-sms-and-imessages  After that, you can zip it :)  <comment252679> If you're jailbroken, yes, otherwise, not really.
