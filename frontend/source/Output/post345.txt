Is there an easy way to remove a URL from Safari's address bar history? <body> So, I love the new, awesomebar-style address bar in Safari 5 - with it's history search, I've gotten to the point where I no longer use bookmarks for most sites, I just remember the 2-4 letter strings that will bring what I want to the top of the search results.  This is great, except for when I screw up and add things to the history that screw with it. For example, one of my most used shortcuts was to get to a site I frequent by typing "bl" and hitting enter. Somehow, at one point, I did this without a search coming up, and now, the "Top Hit" for "bl" is "http://bl/", which is obviously, not an actual site.  Is there any way to remove a single entry from the history without clearing the history entirely?  strongBonus points if it can be done from the address bar without navigating around in prefs or anything./strong While the answers currently given work, I'd love to find an emeasier/em way to do it.  <answer346> click on show all bookmark (open book) on top-left of your safari. then search the site you want to remove (e.g: http://bl) after that delete it from history when you delete the singe site you never find http://bl when press bl in address bar.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bHq4w.png" alt="alt text"  search here:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/BTbAc.png" alt="alt text"  <answer347> Go in bookmarks menu and select show bookmarks, then search the url you want to delete with the search field on the top right (under the search engine bar), select the url to remove in the bottom part on hit delete key  <answer194657> In strongSafari 8/strong the accepted answer no longer seems to work as history isn't within the bookmarks any more. Instead, there are options in the codeHistory/code menu to show and edit history.   As pointed out in a comment above by Loïc Wolff you can use the keyboard combination codeOpt+Cmd+2/code to show history and a search field is available at the bottom right.  <comment308> +1 Would love to find a fix for this - especially when clearing the history does nothing to resolve it. (Just shows as "Top Hit"). <comment309> This worked perfectly, going to leave this open for a day or so to see if there's a faster way to do this on the fly from the address bar though. Thanks! <comment310> It's fast enough I think :P and also your welcome. <comment311> @LessPop_MoreFizz: Does this fix it for you? <comment313> Just came to the site to ask the exact same question! <comment316> @less if you don't want to click, you can always use `Opt+Cmd+2` to access History <comment319> @Chealion: Yes it does. <comment320> @LessPop_MoreFizz: Good to hear. <comment232256> @LoïcWolff With Safari 8.0.6 I couldn't find history in the bookmarks as described above, but your keyboard combination shows a searchable list that includes favourites and history. Thanks.
