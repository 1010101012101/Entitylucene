Creating Project Templates in XCode? <body> I might be using the wrong words when searching but can't seem to find anything on this.  I want to be able to create a project template, i.e a starting point for some new projects. One Example would be:  I create a New Single View Application and add the required code for slide out menus on the left and right. Now when I create a new project, I want to be able to just start from my project with the slide out menus etc and not have to recode/copy paste that every time.  Is something like this possible?  Thanks
