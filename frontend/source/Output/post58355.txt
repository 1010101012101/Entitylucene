How can I bring a window to frontmost without focusing it using Applescript in OS X 10.8 <body> I want to bring a window (QuickTime for example) to frontmost, strongwithout focusing it/strong. I can do it in OS X 10.7 using the following code in Applescript.  precodetell application "System Events"     set visible of process "QuickTime Player" to true end tell /code/pre  This is a Python equivalent.  precodefrom ScriptingBridge import * process = SBApplication.applicationWithBundleIdentifier_('com.apple.systemevents').processes().objectWithName_('QuickTime Player') process.setVisible_(True) /code/pre  But it does not work after I upgraded to OS X 10.8. Is there any way to make it work?  <answer58394> So, from what I gather from your post, you are trying to bring an application into view using Applescript? If so, the code for this in Mountain Lion is actually fairly simple! Here it is:   precodetell application "Quicktime Player" activate end tell /code/pre  I hope this works! If it's not what you wanted, let me know and I'll update it for you. :)  <answer58663> If an application has open windows, this should raise them above windows from other applications, but keep them below ones from the current application.  precodetell application "System Events"     perform action "AXRaise" of window 1 of process "QuickTime Player" end tell /code/pre  <comment67190> Well, activate will focus Quicktime, so it is not what I want. I mean, if you open Applescript application, type your code and run it, window focus will be moved to Quicktime. As a result, you cannot type any code before you click the Applescript window for example. <comment67578> That's what I want. Thanks. By the way, where can I find the documentations of the actions? <comment67580> [Accessibility Roles and Attributes Reference: Actions](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/Accessibility_RoleAttribute_Ref/Actions.html). You can see what actions UI elements support with `actions of` or by using Accessibility Inspector. <comment257346> AXRaise is not permitted in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and 10.11 (El-Capitan) unless you added the calling application (the one that executes the AppleScript) to the "Accessibility" section of the "Privacy" tab of the "Security & Privacy" System Preferences panel. This means that the first time you'll try to do it - you'll be presented with system UI that will suggest to take you to the preferences. I can't use it because of the detour in user-experience. Is there another way to raise the window without using AX (accessibility API's) ???
