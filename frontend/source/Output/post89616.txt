OSX won't automatically connect to WiFi <body> About a week ago, my OSX machine stopped connecting to any WiFi networks automatically. If I open the WiFi menu from the top bar and select the desired network, it connects OK. Also, if I enable "Ask to join new networks" from the Network preferences, it shows the "No preferred networks found" dialog, even though the network is both in the list shown in that window AND in the preferred networks list in Network preferences - WiFi - Advanced...`.  The issue is repeatable both in my work and home networks. As far as I know, I've done no configuration changes or updates or such since the 10.8.3 update.  UPDATE: This may be hackintosh-related, since I get an error message from the bootloader saying codeUnable to handle key preferred-networks/code. I'm not sure what this site's stance on hackintoshes is so I posted this on the bootloader's forum as well. UPDATE 2: Not an issue of the bootloader.  Edit: In reference to Buscar's comment, this is my view of the network preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gOhrS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer89625> Sometimes network locations get messed up, but you can start fresh: go into the Location menu and create a new network location. Click on Apply, and check again and the WiFi situation improves.  <answer89723> Reading this question reminded me that I had dealt with the same problem with my Mac awhile ago.  I fixed it by writing a shell script which was automatically called via codelaunchd/code whenever code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration//code changes.  You'll have to configure a few things, mainly create a list of known SSIDs and passwords for the networks that you join.

I'm glad to hear it was useful to someone else, especially after I re-wrote it :-)  If you pull it apart and try some of the commands on the command-line, you might get a better error message than what System Preferences shows you.
