Kernel panic waking up from deep sleep <body> I have an Early 2015 13" rMBP that was recently re-imaged with El Cap 10.11.4 (corporate image, McAffe, JAMF, etc).  Every time my machine goes to sleep for more than a few hours, it boots up saying it was "shut down because of an error".  I've done the standard steps of resetting the SMC and clearing NVRAM to no avail.  While I do have VMWare Fusion on here, it happens even when no VMs are running.  Two other strange things: 1) The crashdump has pretty much nothing in it, just the CPU flags. 2) I have an identical rMBP with the same installation image and it does not have any issues.  Attached are the console logs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WEc5R.png" alt="enter image description here"
