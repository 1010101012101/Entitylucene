MBA Randomly Powering Off - mostly during start-up <body> My mid-2014 MacBook Air has been randomly powering off since yesterday.  Seems to be stable right now whilst on AC. Since yesterday, I've been able to get it 'stable' by being still, and having it survive after the boot screen and being post start-up for at least 5 minutes. This is usually after being on AC, so I don't yet know if it's:  ul lishort-circuiting (being still)/li liboot related, start-up item related/li libattery misreporting/li /ul  I've tried:  ul liPRAM twice/li liSMC a few times/li liDisk Util. First Aid from recovery/li /ul  Disk Util. First Aid reported that there was "corruption" in Sierra (likely due to a dozen power-offs), but the Recovery Partition reported that it was fixed (false reporting of free space less than was available).  Seems to be OS unrelated as it will very frequently die seconds from pressing the power (I'll hear half of the chime and then it dies).   Chime is always present. OS X battery status is "Normal". Cycle count is 450, mA = 3377, 85% currently. (according to emsystem_profiler SPPowerDataType/em)  What's possibly wrong? I'm thinking it's the battery...
