Appstore multiple update of the same application <body> When I open up the AppStore, under updates, the application thinks that I need to update the same application several times. In this case Command Line Tools is listed several times in a row. How do I remove these multiple entries from the app store.  <answer151578> The log of your updates are available in:  precode~/Library/Application Support/App Store/updatejournal.plist /code/pre  The simple solution is to clear the update logs by deleting the mentioned file.   Here is the guide to remove duplicate if you want to keep the update logs.  ol liOpen Terminal./li liConvert the codeupdatejournal.plist/code by entering this line codeplutil -convert xml1/code then drag the codeupdatejournal.plist/code from Finder into Terminal to expand the path, then press kbdReturn/kbd. Mine is the following:  precodeplutil -convert xml1 ~/Library/Application\ Support/App\ Store/updatejournal.plist  /code/pre/li liOpen code~/Library/Application\ Support/App\ Store/updatejournal.plist/code with your favorite text editor (TextEdit works fine)./li liFind the duplicate update logs. For example, mine is strongCommand Line Tools (OS X 10.10)/strong. The point is to delete that entry which is inside the scope of code&lt;dict&gt;/code. So you should delete the content between code&lt;dict&gt;/code and code&lt;/dict&gt;/code. Here is line I need to delete. Save the file.  precode&lt;dict&gt;     &lt;key&gt;__isSoftwareUpdate&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;true/&gt;     &lt;key&gt;installDate&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;date&gt;2014-10-17T09:55:17Z&lt;/date&gt;     &lt;key&gt;productKey&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;031-08844&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;release-notes&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Command Line Developer Tools for OS X 10.10&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;title&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;Command Line Tools (OS X 10.10)&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;key&gt;version&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;string&gt;6.1&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/dict&gt; /code/pre/li liConvert the file back to binary1 by entering this line codeplutil -convert binary1/code and drag the codeupdatejournal.plist/code from Finder, and press kbdReturn/kbd. Here is mine in Terminal:  precodeplutil -convert binary1 ~/Library/Application\ Support/App\ Store/updatejournal.plist  /code/pre/li liOpen Mac App Store and refresh the strongUpdates/strong section. The duplicate line should disappear. Remember to only delete one entry of duplicate file. Imagine that codeplist/code as a spreadsheet with duplicate lines. Just delete one./li /ol  Feel free to leave question in comment if the tutorial is vague.  <answer152149> Try to clear App Store cache, reboot your Mac and check the App Store.   To clear the cache, open Terminal and copy and paste following command:  codeopen $TMPDIR../C//code   In the Finder window that will open, locate the codecom.apple.appstore/code folder and move it to Trash.   Reboot your Mac.  <answer212345> Just reboot your mac before updating.  <answer216078> I experienced the same problem but did not resolve it even by editing 'updatejournal.plist.'  A website which was written in Japanese provided a solution and it resolved the issue at last.  I hope your problem will be resolved by this method.  http://qiita.com/hshimo/items/5bbc85bb98530c4ac591 (written in Japanese)  Please allow me to copy the essential points here.  He said it was due to a Spotlight behavior (when Spotlight is disabled).  To resolve this, we once need to re-enable Spotlight:  pre$ sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist $ sudo mdutil -E //pre  and re-disable it (if you need), after rebooted OS in my case, by:  pre$ sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist/pre  I hope it helps.
