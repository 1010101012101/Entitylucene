Can I create a formula to provide a value depending on when a timestamp falls in the day? <body> In column A, I have timestamp values. In a second column, I'd like to have a formula that would return words or strings like "early morning" or "Late afternoon", so that I may count and chart these responses.  What formula am I looking for in Apple's Numbers?  <answer227105> Assuming you have a normal Numbers Date/Time code2/11/2016 12:00:00 AM/code, then a simple codeIF()/code statement can be used combined with the codeHOUR/code function.  code=IF( HOUR ( A2 ) &lt; 12, "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon")/code  To add more than just 2 options, nest your codeIF/code statement.  code=IF(HOUR(A3) &lt; 5,"Early",IF(HOUR(A3) &lt; 12,"Morning",IF(HOUR(A3) &lt; 17,"afternoon",IF(HOUR(A3) &lt; 20,"evening","night"))))/code  Numbers will return the first TRUE value.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gs9pT.png" alt="Formula Sample"  <comment275788> It's a good idea to provide sample of your timestamp values. <comment275853> Is it a UNIX timestamp?  Or just the standard date and time from Numbers insert date?  How are the timestamp values generated? <comment275857> So I'm generating these time stamps with a text expander snippet, which I imagine means that it is really being converted via Numbers' standard insert date. <comment275858> 2/11/2016 12:00:00 AM  Like that? <comment275874> @bjbk yes, that's right
