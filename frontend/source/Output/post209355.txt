How can I force Chrome to open links with specific profile? <body> I'm using user profile switching in Chrome, which works perfectly fine. Except for when I'm clicking links, that are depending on one of the profiles being logged in. By default Chrome just opens the link in this profile, which was used last.   How can I force Chrome to use specific profile?  <answer245151> With the current version of Chrome (51.0.2704.106 (64-bit)) you can just right-click an url and then open it with the fourth menu choice from top: "Open Link as codePROFILE/code" (your configured Chrome profile). I hope this helps.  <comment311659> not working any more :( <comment337253> This does work, however, not when opening links from any other app, which is where I most often run into this annoying problem. Furthermore, it would be great to have a default app and not need to remember and go through this menu process for each link.
