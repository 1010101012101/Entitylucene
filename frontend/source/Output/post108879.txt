Troubleshooting spontaneous logout (window server crash?) <body> After upgrading to Mavericks while running GoTo Meeting (v5.*) I'm suddenly logged out and sent to the login screen.  The behavior is very erratic, and when it happens, it happens repeatedly, enough that I have to stop using GoTo Meeting.  I've searched around for issues on this, but none seem to apply to my scenario.  In the past I've been able to troubleshoot crashes with the kernel dump you get after the restart, but since it's a successful logout I'm not getting any info.  Where else can I look to try and identify the source of this issue?  h2Update/h2  After some extensive console scanning it appears I do have some crash reports which I've uploaded as a gist.  I'm trying googling random portions of it, but no luck so far.  There isn't anything exception in there that seems to jump out at me as to what the issue might be.

Any event, GTM has specific info, see my answer. <comment130160> For others it might be interesting you indicate in your initial description which version caused the problem you are talking of. <comment140044> I filed a bug report describing this issue and (impotant!) attaching the WindowServer crash report: https://bugreport.apple.com  My ticket has already been marked as a duplicate. I encourage everybody having this issue to file a ticket since the amount of dupes for an issue will (hopefully) increase the priority in Apple resolving it.
