Faulty power button on an iphone 3g and upgrade to 4.1 <body> I have a jailbroken 3.1.3 iPhone 3G with a faulty power button. I would like to upgrade it to the newest version of iOS possible, but obviously it needs to be done without using said power button - can it be done? And if so, what would be the best way to approach it?  <answer74096> I'm not sure of the details of your question - but you can use 'Activatior' to give another button all the funcationality of the power button. (one of the volume switches perhaps)   <comment69246> Faulty how? And why would you need the power button?
