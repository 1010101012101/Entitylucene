Disable Little Snitch in guest account? <body> It's annoying as hell to let others use your computer on a guest account with Little Snitch installed, all the consecutive popups one after another...it's really ridiculous.  Also in the event my Macbook is stolen, a user logs into guest, all the dialogs will clearly let him know to disable connections.  So little luck there using "Find my Mac."  Anyway to just disable this or set a rule to allow everything?  Of course any rules created in LS within the guest account do not save after logout.  <answer83628> ol liLogin to the Guest Account./li liDisable Little Snitch Network Filter/li liOpen Library  Preferences,  copy at.obdev.LittleSnitch... to a shared folder/li liLogout and Login to Main Account/li liOpen Terminal and run sudo su/li liOpen Library/username/Library/Preferences and overwrite file with copied file./li liLogout and Login to Guest Account.  LS is Disabled./li /ol  <answer98274> @user43855's steps work correctly (except for step 6 which is missing a crucial bit), but they also assume the user is very familiar with what is being done. I have expanded to include step-by-step details for disabling Little Snitch automatically in the Guest account.  This process creates a Little Snitch preferences file where Little Snitch is disabled, and then copies that file to the codeUser Template/code folder that is copied every time the Guest account is recreated. (Note the User Template folder is also used for the creation of new accounts, so if you want Little Snitch on in a new account, you will have to enable it after the account is created.)  ol liLogin to the Guest account./li liDisable Little Snitch Network Filter in Little Snitch's settings./li liOpen Finder, and press kbd⌘/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdG/kbd./li liIn the box labeled "Go to the folder", enter code~/Library/Preferences/code and press kbdEnter/kbd./li liFind the file named codeat.obdev.LittleSnitch.plist/code and right-click on it.

Do you use fast user switching and expect LS to run on one account and leave the other alone or will the main user log out before guest logs in <comment96202> Although if the point of using Little Snitch is to stop programs contacting unknown sites doesn't allowing the guest account defeat this object? <comment96242> I'm not interested in fast user switching.  I just want it on in the main account and off in the guest.  Or, I would like to set rules in guest that are different than those in the main. <comment96249> Perhaps I could save the Guest rules to a shared folder and they would always engage? <comment96273> Boom, just like that. <comment114969> Is there any way you could expand on your answer please? I tried following the steps but I can't find the file mentioned in step 3 where it's suggested that I should be seeing it... <comment114970> You may have to Option-Click on the Go To menu in Finder to access the Library folder in Mountain Lion. <comment115370> Any new accounts created on the Mac when this process is complete will also have Little Snitch disabled. The User Template is used to create new accounts. <comment115409> @pknz good call, I edited to note that. <comment178647> I just tried following this tutorial and I can't find the at.obdev.LittleSnitch.plist file. There are at.obdev.LittleSnitchConfiguration.plist and two others but no sign of the file you mention. I wonder if this because I upgraded to Yosemite. Would you know a solution for this? <comment178658> Use at.obdev.LittleSnitchConfiguration.plist. They likely changed the name of the file since this was last updated.
