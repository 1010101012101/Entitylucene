Is there a terminal emulator for Mac OS X that supports binding Ctrl+(Shift)+Tab? <body> I want to bind kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to code\033[27;5;9~/code and kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to code\033[27;6;9~/code. Unless I am missing something, the default Mac OS X terminal emulator will not let you bind these key sequences to custom escape sequences like it does with the "F" keys (kbdF1/kbd, kbdF2/kbd, etc.) and most other keys.  Is there another terminal emulator I can use on Mac OS X that does support rebinding those keys?  <answer229159> Yes.  There is a product called iTerm2.  The best part is that it's FOSS  One of the features of iTerm2 is that you can remap any of the keys including the ones you asked about.  For instance, I remapped kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd to send the text code"blah"/code it it worked perfectly.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Asn28.png" alt="enter image description here"  After hitting kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdTab/kbd, it sends the keystroke:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1scn2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment279493> I just installed iTerm2 and was able to remap Ctrl+(Shift)+Tab to the desired escape sequences. Thanks!
