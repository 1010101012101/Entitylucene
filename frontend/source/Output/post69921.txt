How to transfer my apps, home, and OS X setup from an external Lion disk to an internal Mountain Lion SSD <body> I installed an SSD (Samsung 830) as the internal drive of a Mid 2009 MacBook Pro, then attempted several times to clone the (now external) bootable OS X Lion drive using either SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner to this new SSD. All attempts failed with disk writes failures (I tried two different SSDs with the same result: write failures). So installed Lion onto the new SSD using the OS X DVD installer and all went fine; then upgraded from Lion to Mountain Lion from the App Store. Again, all went great.  Which folders should I copy from the external Lion disk to the internal Mountain Lion SSD to get back all my apps, the MySQL server, PostgreSQL, ImageMagick, XCode installation, etc.? I would like to make the new Mountain Lion SSD contain all my useful apps so that I donâ€™t have to reinstall from scratch.  <answer69923> The easiest way is to use strongMigration Assistant/strong, which you can find in strongcode/Applications/Utilities//code/strong.  It can copy your apps, data and settings from your old disk if it's connected via USB, Firewire or Thunderbolt. You should end up with a mirror image of your old set up.  Start Migration Assistant, select emFrom another Mac, PC, Time Machine backup, or other disk/em on the first screen, and emFrom a Time Machine backup or other disk/em on the second screen, then follow the prompts.  If you need more detailed instructions, consult Apple's Migration Assistant Guide (you want the emTime Machine or other disk migration/em section).
