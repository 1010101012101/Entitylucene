Can I connect an iPad to a monitor with with an Apple Digital AV Adapter converted to DVI? <body> I need to connect my 3rd-generation iPad to an older monitor. I already own an Apple Digital AV Adapter. Other than the need to purchase an HDMI to DVI cable is there anything preventing me from hooking my iPad up this way?  <answer53836> I went ahead and ordered an HDMI to DVI adapter cable from Amazon. Using this cable and the most recent Apple Digital AV Adapter I was able to mirror my iPad on my old monitor.  <comment61282> I don't see why not. Given the dearth of answers, though, it might be best for you to try it out and answer your own question. <comment61283> @CajunLuke thats my line of thinking as well. Off to mono price to order the cable.
