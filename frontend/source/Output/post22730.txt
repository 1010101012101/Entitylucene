Is it possible to enable "Focus follows Scrolling"? <body> I tried out Focus follows mouse and found too many occasions when it really annoys me. Thinking about the cases when I would need focus follows mouse, I realized that it's only necessary when I'm scrolling in a non-active window.   So: Is there the possibility of having the focus switch to a window in that I scroll? Either via some setting or external application?  <answer23939> I find that many applications already behave this way.  At least with a trackpad.  If I am working in this window, responding to your comment, and I hover over another Safari window, OR over my iTunes window, I can scroll without clicking on the other window.  My computer is emnot/em set to Focus follows mouse.  It may well be that some applications do not support this...   Do you have a specific set of apps in mind?  <comment26745> Please re-read my question: Is there the possibility of having the *focus switch to a window in that I scroll*? I do want to have the focus changed if I scroll in some other window. <comment27535> Sorry about that...  I see what you are looking for now.   I don't know if you can do that. <comment27586> I'm just looking into doing that programatically now and have posted an appropriate question on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7316105/system-wide-recognition-of-scroll-events-on-mac-osx-and-setting-focus-to-a-differ
