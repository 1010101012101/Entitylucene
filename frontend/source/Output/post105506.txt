How do I tell iOS 7 which address is my “home” address? <body> In iOS 7, if you bring up the Notification Center in some circumstances it will tell you, “Right now, it would take you 18 minutes to drive home.” I recently moved and the address that iOS 7 has set as “home” is now incorrect, but I still want to include the old address in my contact card. How do I inform Siri (and the rest of the system) that my “home” address has changed?  <answer105524> This should do the trick:  ul liEdit your contact card on your phone (in the Contacts application);/li liChange the label of your old address to anything you want;/li liSet the label of your new address to "home"/li /ul  <comment124094> That seems to have done the trick. Thanks!
