Can I oblige Mail.app to (ask to) send via BCC when sending to a large group? <body> I just made the (classical) stupid mistake to strongnot BCC-send/strong a mailing to Â± 100 people.  br:( brIs there an extension or application or script for mail.app to prevent this failure and e.g. intelligently ask me how I want my mail to be send (normal, CC or BCC), when sending to, say, more than 5 people? :)  <answer90728> Mail is notoriously difficult to script effectively - particularly when it comes to outgoing messages not created by the running script.  pre tell application "Mail"   set _title to name of front window   set mList to messages of drafts mailbox whose subject is _title   if length of mList = 1 then     set _msg to item 1 of mList     if length of (get _msg's to recipients)  5 then       beep       error "Too many To-Recipients!  Do you want to send BCC?"     else       return "Send_Normal"     end if   end if end tell /pre  Something like this can be used in conjunction with Keyboard Maestro or a similar macro utility to have the utility select the send-menu-item.  While you can use System Events to do this I find that it sometimes takes 3 or more seconds to launch on my machine if it's not already running, and you start wondering why your macro isn't working when it finally takes off.  Other caveats to this approach are that the message must have been saved at least once to be detected.  So what you want to do is possible but very hackish.  -ccs
