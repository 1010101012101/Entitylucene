Banners when Do Not Disturb is on <body> I just got a new iPhone 5s and I've been trying to adapt it to my needs.  I do remember that on my 4s, I only switched between silent (with vibrate) and Do Not Disturb modes. When I was using the phone on strongdo not disturb/strong, it did not vibrate but a banner appeared when I received a new SMS or WhatsApp.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to reproduce this on my new phone. Now it seems that I have to choose, when in Do Not Disturb mode, between a completely silent phone (no vibrate and no banners) or a vibrating phone + banners when I receive new messages.  How can I resolve this?  <comment187892> Check your settings for Do Not Disturb. There is an option that allows you to have it enabled while the phone is open, which should disable vibration. <comment187985> Yup, but when I do this DND also disables notification banners... So when I receive a message I don't even know I did :(
