If I buy Pages from the Mac OS app store, do I then have to buy it again in the iOS store? <body> I'd like to not have to buy it twice.   <answer63670> Yes, you do. They are two entirely separate apps for two radically different devices.    <answer101226> OS X and iOS are two different operating systems so it doesn't work. The one for the iPad is a simpler (smaller file) than the one for the mac. So yes you need to buy a copy for your mac and another for your iPhone/ipad.  <comment77093> What a scam. I'll stick with open source. <comment77094> It's not a scam. Do you expect the vendor of a Windows app to give you the Mac version for free or vice-versa? <comment352558> @CajunLuke As it happens, Microsoft and Adobe _do_ give you both Mac and Windows versions of their flagship software for the same subscription price. <comment352560> And Apple also happens to give away Pages for free with the purchase of a new Mac or iOS device. Individual examples don't mean that it's something we should expect all the time from everybody.
