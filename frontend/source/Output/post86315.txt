Prevent iTunes from opening when connecting bluetooth headset <body> Every time I connect my bluetooth headset to my Mac, iTunes decides it's time to launch.  Is there a way I can prevent this behavior?  I found this thread, but there is no solution: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2570254?start=0&amp;tstart=0  ul liOS X 10.8.3/li liiTunes 11.0.2 (26)/li liUsing Beats Wireless/li /ul  hr  h3Update/h3  Even after removing iTunes from my computer, it stills prompts me to "find iTunes" whenever a bluetooth audio device is connected.  <answer88235> It is completely stupid and seemingly unrelated but it works:  In the CDs and DVDs preference pane disable iTunes to launch inserted for Audio CDs  your headset is an audio cd you know ;-)  <answer92209> Remove iTunes (you can reinstall later, but who would want to do that)  precodesudo rm -rf /Applications/iTunes /code/pre  Create a "do nothing" application using Automator.  Just open Automator, create an empty application, and save it.  Connect your device.  You will be prompted to find iTunes.  Click kbdbrowse/kbd and select your "do nothing" application.  <answer98462> Extending Steve's answer, plus some tips from this apple discussion, here's what I did that finally solved this.  1) Create a "Do Nothing App": open Automator, create an empty application, and save it as DoNothingApp.app  2) Rename iTunes (manually in the Applications directory, or using this terminal command):  codesudo mv /Applications/iTunes.app /Applications/iTunesBACK.app/code  3) Make a copy of DoNothingApp.app as iTunes.app (manually, or using this terminal command):  codesudo cp -R /Applications/DoNothingApp.app /Applications/iTunes.app/code  That's it. Of course, your iTunes is now called iTunesBACK.   <answer125119> Solution explained by imp68 worked for me  Short version:  ul liRemove iTunesHelper from your user's Login items/li /ul  Step by step version:  ul liOpen "strongSystem Preferences/strong"/li liClick "strongUsers &amp; Groups/strong"/li liSelect your user/li liClick "strongLogin Items/strong" in right panel/li liRemove strongiTunesHelper/strong/li liLog off and back in (strongMUST DO/strong)/li /ul  and voil√† !  <answer129565> I'm on a MBP with osx 10.9.2. Disabling iTunes in "CD and DVD" preferences does not help. Just renaming iTunes to something else does not work.   The service "Remote Control Daemon", rdc, is responsible for delivering commands to (for example) iTunes. Use this script, iTunesPatch. This script modifies the actual binary for rdc to inhibit the command it sends to start iTunes, which means that all other functions of rdc still works as expected.   <answer145394> I've got this figured out.  On OSX, the "RCD" (remote control daemon) is responsible for the naughtiness. It has hard-coded list of actions to do when it detects certain "events" - one of them being connecting to a bluetooth headset.  To disable this behaviour (minimal loss of functionality, possibly your apple remote won't work), use the following two commands:     launchctl stop com.apple.rcd       launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist   This should stop rcd from being launched by OSX. No rcd - no auto-magic multimedia. Your volume keys should continue working, but things like play key (or bluetooth) auto-starting iTunes should stop. With code-w/code option the change should be persistent.  PS: The following is the nuclear option. In Terminal, enter:     sudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd      sudo pkill -9 rcd   To stop rcd from even being started by any app. To restore your rcd, use:     sudo chmod 755 /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd      launchctl start com.apple.rcd   <answer205014> I've had the same issues with mine... but there is  ol lian app to route BT events to media keys /li lian app to redirect media keys to specific apps: Media Keys by "Gear player" creator./li /ol  <answer222598> I was also being driven mad with a new Plantronics Backbeat Pro headset, just a slight movement of the earpiece started iTunes.  I found I could disable the sensors on the headset.     Go to plantronics.com/myheadset-updater. You can download a program called MyHeadset Updater. It allows you to disable the sensors. You can also download the latest firmware.  <answer226265> so i was having this issue with my macbook where it was launching Itunes as soon as my headphone jack was plugged in.....i called Apple and they helped me disable it... here is how.  ol liOPEN FINDER/li liGO TO APPLICATIONS/li liHIGHLIGHT ITUNES/li liRIGHT CLICK ITUNES AND CLICK "GET INFO"/li liUNLOCK SHARING PERMISSIONS BY CLICKING ON THE "LOCK ICON" BOTTOM RIGHT AND PUTTING IN YOUR LOG IN PASSWORD/li liWHERE IT SAYS "EVERYONE", SELECT THE DROP DOWN BOX AND SELECT "NO ACCESS"/li liLOCK THE "LOCK ICON"/li liRESTART (not necessary)AND PROBLEM SOLVED (FOR ME)./li /ol  P.S. you will not be able to open itunes until you undo this process, hopes this help.  <answer273341> WORKING FIX, simplest and most effective solution (per mritunjai at https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2570254?start=75&amp;tstart=0):  ol liOpen Terminal/li liEnter (these are two separate commands    launchctl stop com.apple.rcdbr launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.rcd.plist  /li /ol  <answer273634> I just did this (Yes, I know this can be done in a single command, but it is clearer as two):  precodecd /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS sudo chmod 0 iTunes /code/pre  And problem solved - no muss, no fuss (i.e., no prompts for "finding iTunes").  I'm guessing that this (just codechmod/codeing the actual executable) is slightly sneakier than codechmod/codeing the top level directory (code/Applications/iTunes.app/code).  I'm guessing that that prevents it from thinking you've just moved it somewhere else.  <comment99684> check iTunes preference settings! <comment99704> If you list your headset's Bluetooth profile or just the exact model, there might be an answer by disabling the play/pause functionality that could be built into the device. <comment99705> Please be more specific, and provide more detailed information. Computer type, operatings system, iTune version,... <comment99737> Updated with my info <comment103266> Didn't work for me. <comment108242> Instead of removing iTunes a simple `sudo chmod 000 /Applications/iTunes.app` should be enough (and avoid the reinstall later on). To revert run `sudo chmod 755 /Applications/iTunes.app` <comment134444> I found an an app that disables the play/pause media key. This might work for the bluetooth issue as well, and if so, it's a better solution than the one I propose above. http://redth.info/itunes-media-hotkey-disabler/ <comment148794> The workaround to disable Itunes helper does not work. Ituneshelper will re appear after login even if removed. I have actually gone and found the ituneshelper.app file and renamed it and itunes continues to start when my headset is turned on! As to the workaround with terminal and renaming files that completely disabled my keyboard on my macbook air! Be very careful using this! Luckily i was able to reset the computer using a bluetooth keyboard to recover. There is really no help in this thread for OSX 10.9 using itunes. <comment152193> I do not see iTunesHelper in my Login Items on mavericks <comment168639> This didn't work for me in Mavericks <comment187016> Finally!  Something that works on Yosemite <comment200128> None of these options worked for me on 10.9.5 using Beats Wireless. <comment200129> +1 for chmod. This worked for me on 10.9.5 using Beats Wireless. <comment219443> Worked on 10.10.3 using Apple EarPods. <comment219533> Won't this break updates that include iTunes? <comment222589> On a MacBook Air with OS X 10.9.5, this worked (while the accepted answer of renaming the ITunes app did not, as the system would just launch the renamed app). THANK YOU. <comment234304> Didn't work for me on OS X 10.9.5 with a Bose headset. <comment234422> @Paul, I'd bet 99% that it will break the update or something. I really don't care, iTunes is breaking my workflow with this stupid behavior. Bounty on its way, Joe, thanks! <comment235788> That worked for me on Yosemite <comment241712> It is there in Yosemite, but need some time to see if disabling this really works <comment267863> This no longer works for me on 10.11, but @mritun's solution below does. <comment273178> What are the side effects of this workaround? Does it just prevent iTunes from opening when a bluetooth headset is affected? Also when you mean the play key, is that the play key on the keyboard or the bluetooth device? <comment277929> This is sooo weird, but using this fix causes my logitech wireless mouse to stop working. The clicking still works, but the mouse no longer moves. When I reload (e.g. `launchctl load -w ...`, `launchctl start ...`, unplug the logitech dongle, plug it back in), my mouse starts working again. I tried it 3 times and every time my mouse stops working. <comment284569> Make sure you restart the computer after doing this. It worked for me after a restart on a MacBook Pro (Mid 2012), El Capitan 10.11.4. <comment300650> Works in El Capitan. Thanks! <comment325952> This worked great however now in OSX 10.12.1 when you type: sudo chmod 000 I get 'Operation not permitted.' Anyone know a way around that? <comment341280> Works in macOS Sierra 10.12.3. And I didn't event needed to logoff/reboot. Just unpaired the headphones and paired them again. Never happened again. <comment347226> @DavidNelson type "sudo su -" first and enter your password. This will elevate your permissions. <comment348626> It's important once you unload it to do the `sudo chmod 000 /System/Library/CoreServices/rcd.app/Contents/MacOS/rcd`  All kinds of crap manually will start RCD (sometimes the play button, sometimes headphone built in controls).  This seem also something you might need to do periodically--apple likes to undo you local changes like this during updates/os upgrades <comment357807> I don't see iTunesHelper in Sierra 10.12.4 :( <comment363164> Very simple, very easy. Worked under Sierra. Thanks.
