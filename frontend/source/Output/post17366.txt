Disable opening PDFs inline in Safari 5.1 <body> In Safari 5.0 or below it's very easy to disable opening pdfs inline, you simply say  precodedefaults write com.apple.Safari WebKitOmitPDFSupport -bool YES /code/pre  and it never bothers you again.  In Safari 5.1 this no longer works. Does anyone know an alternative to prevent Safari 5.1 opening PDFs in the browser rather than as a download and then in Preview?  <comment18930> Questions about prerelease software are off-topic. Please ask again once Lion and Safari 5.1 are released. <comment18931> wow that's lame. <comment18937> Totally lame. Apple is only a company. We pay for the equipment. We come here because we seek counsel from an independent source. Where else do you enforce Apple's restrictions? <comment18939> @Peter, @chiggsy: Discussion about Apple beta or pre-release software is not allowed because doing so is restricted by their NDA required to use it and answers are subject to change and not officially supported. I agree it is inconvenient, but there are valid reasons for not allowing discussions of pre-release software (of any company's, not just Apple's). If you wish to discuss this further, then I suggest opening a topic in Meta. <comment18948> @Philip: thanks for the details. Sounds reasonable. <comment18983> Ahh right, the NDA. Fair enough I guess. <comment18985> The other main reason that we don't allow questions about prerelease software is that they are usually too localized. Things change quickly in that world, so questions about prerelease software grow stale quickly.
