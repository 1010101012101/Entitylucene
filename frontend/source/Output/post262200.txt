In FireFox, how can I make new windows start blank with the focus in the URL bar? <body> In FireFox version 50 on OS X 10.10.5, when I create a new window (using ⌘-N), the new window opens with the FireFox logo and the input focus on the search field in the middle of the page:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HHGjw.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would really much rather prefer to start with a emblank/em page and the input focus emin the URL bar/em. How can I configure FireFox to behave that way?  In my FireFox Preferences, in the General tab, for "When Firefox starts" I have the setting "Show my windows and tabs from last time" and I want to keep that setting. Hopefully whatever is needed to change the ⌘-N behavior does not need to change the value of this preference setting.   <answer262265> To have Firefox open a new window to a blank page, you'll need to set the Home Page to codeabout:blank/code under General preferences (about:preferences#general in the Address bar).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F80lQ.png" alt="General preferences"  hr  Then when pressing kbd⌘/kbdkbdN/kbd, this is what a new window will look like when it opens:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HGJKP.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment328537> I knew about this setting and **did** have this set to blank. The only thing that makes sense at this point is that the update from v. 49 to v. 50 must have changed this setting. Grrrr. Anyway, thanks.
