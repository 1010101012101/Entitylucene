How do I add a directory to PATH when using `zsh` in Sierra <body> In macOS Sierra 10.12.x, what is the modern way to add a directory to the PATH environment variable that can work across shells or specifically work with emzsh/em shell (I switched from the default bash to zsh).   I have seen some Questions and Answers such as this one that are bash-specific. And I have seen some such as this one about launchd but it seems I've read launchd is not the right right in later versions of macOS (not sure). I could find no specific references for Sierra, so I am posting now.  I am trying to install Maven with instructions saying:     Add the bin directory of the created directory apache-maven-3.3.9 to the PATH environment variable   <answer275369> This answer (to a different question) suggests modifying code/private/etc/paths/code or adding a file to the directory code/private/etc/paths/d/code. I just tried codesudo nano /private/etc/paths/code, added code/foo/code at the end of the file, and opened a new tab in Terminal, and codeecho $PATH/code showed code/foo/code as expected, in both codebash/code and codezsh/code shells.  Assuming you've installed Maven to code/opt/apache-maven-3.3.3/code you could add code/opt/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin/code to code/private/etc/paths/code. However, and I've not tried this (it's been several years since I last did any Java development), I'd be inclined to instead add a file codeMaven/code (containing code/opt/apache-maven-3.3.3/bin/code) to code/private/etc/paths.d/code - that'll encapsulate the Maven-specific path change, making it easier to clean up if you ever delete (or upgrade) Maven.  <answer275834> h1codeexport/code/h1  To change the path within your shell session, not system-wide, you can use the bash-style codeexport/code command with zsh, as documented here.   The name of the codePATH/code variable is case-sensitive and must be all-uppercase.  precodeexport PATH=$PATH:/folder/you/want /code/pre  To verify your change, run:  precodeecho $PATH /code/pre  You will see results like this.     /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/folder/you/want   <comment346405> For maven you just need to edit the shell start files in your home directory. The more complex ways are for running guide apps
