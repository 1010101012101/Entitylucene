Use a time capsule as external tethered harddisk <body> I have a 1 TB time capsule which I no longer need as a wireless station.  I can however certainly find a use the 1 TB which already has some data on it.  I plugged it into the wall socket and tried to connect it to my 2009 iMac with an ethernet cable. I found the hard disk in the network and started to copy an old 60 GB iPhoto backup to it. It will take 3-6 days so I had another look and I assume it is copying over the wireless. I see the two networks I used to have in my wireless dropdown which surprised me since I thought I had turned off the wireless functionality when I clicked "bridge only" in my AirPort Utility.  My questions:  ol liWhy does the harddisk not show up in the device list?/li liWhy does it show in the network list?/li liHow to turn off the wireless and instead connect directly as an external hard disk?/li /ol  <comment301548> If you truly don't care about the contents or settings of the Time Capsule, you might want to do a hardware reset to clear everything.  I don't think this touches the HDD ( http://goo.gl/yeiQOH ) ; and, it should prevent it from showing up as any of your known networks. <comment301549> I truly care about the hard disk content and not at all about settings. Can I use an Ethernet cable to connect the hard disk to the iMac <comment301553> I can't find anything definitive that says the HDD is not affected by the reset. There are some sites that talk about resuming the time machine backups after a reset, but there are others which report problems in trying to do so. Better safe than sorry, I think. <comment301557> It's not in time machine mode but I made manual backups
