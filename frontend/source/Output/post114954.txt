iOS 7 Skype problems <body> Frequently I find myself in the situation when I receive push notifications of new Skype messages. I can see the text and read it. Although, when I open actual Skype app I don't see any updates. Sometimes I have to wait for 2-3 hours for messages to appear. The contact (who sent me a message) is online. And I don't even receive messages on desktop if iOS Skype was running. What's wrong?
