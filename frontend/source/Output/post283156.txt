View Comments/Metadata on Files in Finder Icon View <body> I use a Mac at work and like to add comments to some of images (like when it was published or when we're supposed to receive a product shipment) so I can get a just look at the image in the finder instead of scrolling through a spreadsheet or word document for the same information.  I was wondering if there was some way to make comments visible within the finder's icon view. Yes, I know I can just view comments by switching to list view or pressing Cmd+J —that's what I currently do— but I like icon view. Here's fake screenshot to show you what I'd like to make happen.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lUTfR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  So, is it possible to add a function like this with Automator or something else?
