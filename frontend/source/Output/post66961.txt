Video screensaver in mountain lion <body> Can I somehow have a video loop as a screensaver in mountain lion? I remember the codeSave Hollywood/code app that worked for leopard, but nothing since then. Is there any way?  <answer105903> Save Hollywood has been updated for OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and is available as freeware.  Other paid app options are Video Screensaver (on MAS) and My Living Desktop.  <comment124637> oh cool! i actually made a screensaver myself with quartz. :)
