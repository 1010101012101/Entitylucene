iPhone cannot switch from Video to Photo mode <body> I opened the Camera app, then it told me I could not take anymore time scale photos because I was out of memory. So I swiped the word to the left to get to the video option, and it says I don't have enough memory to take any video.  So now I want to switch from Video to Photo mode, and it won't let me. I've tried swiping, I've tried tapping, and it refuses. I've tried closing and restarting the app, I've tried rebooting the phone to no avail.  <comment181526> Have you deleted anything yet? <comment181527> About 200 photos.  Still giving me the same erorr and won't let me switch <comment181547> I experienced this at one point as well, but I can't remember exactly what resolved it...I'd remove a significant amount of data (e.g. remove a movie or all of your music) and see if that gets you anywhere.
