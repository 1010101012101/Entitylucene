What format does the apple notes sqlite db date use? <body> I want to extract the note texts and modification dates from an sqlite notes database extracted from an iOS device backup. But I can't figure out how to convert the date format to a readable date string.  h1How I got the data/h1  I found out which file had the note data from this page.  Relevant portion:  precodeStep 1. Find the Backup File in ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/Backup/fea….627         something like : ca3b….39c        If you have trouble seeing Library folder         defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles Yes Step 2. Copy file and rename as notes.sqlite  /code/pre  h1What I've tried so far/h1  I've opened the file up and confirmed it has the expected note body text inside it. The body text is inside a table called codeZNOTEBODY/code. Another table called codeZNOTE/code has a a codeZBODY/codecolumn which appears to contain indices into the codeZNOTEBODY/code table, and a codeZMODIFICATIONDATE/code column. Here is the crux of the matter: The codeZMODIFICATIONDATE/code column has a listed type of codeTIMESTAMP/code and it contains floating point numbers.   I looked at the sqlite docs and found this:     SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values:      ul   liTEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). /li   liREAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. /li   liINTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC./li   /ul      Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions.   So I tried using the built-in codedatetime/code function with a simple codeSELECT datetime(ZMODIFICATIONDATE) FROM ZNOTE;/code but that produced nonsense values like code1171380-13689427-18 21:08:40/code for an entry I know corresponds to 2014-08-12. The stored value in question was code429559087.38102/code.  So, does anyone know what format is being used here? Or, more importantly how to convert it to a readable date?  The following stored dates all correspond to (different points on) 2014-08-11, in order of earliest to latest.  ul licode429435093.400244/code/li licode429446655.298724/code /li licode429447111.140259/code/li licode429460783.273032/code/li licode429464301.184442/code/li /ul  (I wasn't sure where to post this, but since it seems like it might be Apple specific, this seemed like the best spot.)  <answer288321> According to this answer on Stack Overflow, it's a Unix timestamp adjusted by 31 years. This is typical of CoreData, Apple's ORM framework. The following would work:  precodeselect datetime(zmodificationdate,'unixepoch','31 years') from znote /code/pre
