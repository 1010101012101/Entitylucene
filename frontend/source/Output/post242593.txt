NSString doesn’t understand the “stringWithString_” message <body> I'm creating an AppleScript Script Library, and want to call some Cocoa methods on NSString. I created an .SCPTD file with this method:  precodeon xtrim(sourceText)     set the sourceString to current application's NSString's stringWithString:sourceText      set whitespace to {space, tab, return, linefeed}     set the adjustedString to sourceString's stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet(whitespace)      return (adjustedString as string) end xtrim /code/pre  However, I get the error codeNSString doesn’t understand the “stringWithString_” message./code. Most answers I find on the internet suggest that the AppleScript/Objective-C Library checkbox is not checked.   However, this checkbox has been removed with the Yosemite release.  What is wrong with the script; is there a fix?  <answer242846> Answer from an Apple thread:     As of Yosemite, ASObjC is available everywhere, not just libraries and applications.  Importing the desired terminology via the codeuse/code statement is now directly supported in the Script Editor - for your example, the codeNSString class/code stuff is available by adding a codeuse framework "Foundation"/code statement.
