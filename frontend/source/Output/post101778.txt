How to write AppleScript for clicking an OK button on a custom dialog? <body> I have done a script to quit program:  precodetell application "Live"     quit end tell /code/pre  â€¦but I get this prompt to click the OK button:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lyp2w.png" alt="Ableton Live"  I am running my Mac for schedule shutdown as it is running for an exhibition with unman on/off.  Could someone help me write an AppleScript to click this button?  <answer101782> You might simulate pressing command-Q and return instead:  precodedelay 0.5 -- time to release modifier keys if for example the script is run with command-R tell application "System Events"     set frontmost of process "Live" to true     keystroke "q" using command down     keystroke return end tell /code/pre  Or use codeignoring application responses/code so the codequit/code command doesn't block the script:  precodedelay 0.5 ignoring application responses     quit application "Live" end ignoring delay 1 tell application "System Events" to keystroke return /code/pre
