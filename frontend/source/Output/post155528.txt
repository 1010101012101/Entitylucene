OSX Yosemite full screen menu bar <body> Is there a way to always keep the menu bar visible in full screen mode?   When developing I like having certain applications take up the full screen but I find the delay in bringing down the menu bar slightly annoying. I'd like the menu bar to be always visible. I followed the answers from this post but changing the LSUIPresentationMode did not do anything.  If anyone has a working solution I'd be happy to try it out!  Thanks!  <answer175147> Like @james_fuller said auto-hiding the doc and maximizing the app window (use the codealt/code key when clicking maximize) will have the requested result. Some apps (Google Chrome) have custom behavior for the maximize button so Shiftit.app can be used to maximize those apps with a simple key command.  <answer192013> I use Moom and works pretty good:  http://manytricks.com/moom/  It allows you to maximize to fullscreen but keeping the menubar still visible. Different than clicking the green button on the window which enters fullscreen.  <answer223006> Alt+Click on the green full screen button does the same as that when strongDouble click/strong the app menu bar  <answer233461> Press strongshift/strong &amp; strongalt/option/strong and click on the green maximize button.  <answer242318> To add the toolbar and keep it there when maximizing the screen I used the option and taped the pad. I was surprised.  <comment182965> Not that I know of - wouldn't just maximised do instead? Or learn the key-commands? <comment185861> I guess I'd like ability to have the screen's full real estate (no dock) but the menu available. I guess I will have to compromise. Thanks! <comment205430> You could set the doc to autohide and then maximize the app window. <comment251380> That's a paid app. Just saying. <comment285295> This was one of the huge annoyances that kept me from upgrading from Mavericks for the longest while. In fact, one of the reasons why I skipped Yosemite entirely. Well, that and various bugs that had to be worked out with a major OS X version, and the fact that the Helvetica kerning / letterspacing looked completely **wrong**. So, a year and a half later of debugging and actually hiring typographers at Apple, I'm back on board again. <comment285308> This does not maximise use the other answers for that <comment285324> I don't see any difference between alt/click & shift/alt/click <comment342987> Does any of these answers keep the separate "desktop space" page when entering the maximized window state? Seems to just maximize it within the current space :(
