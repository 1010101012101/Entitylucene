In iMovie, is there any way to apply a PIP dissolve at the end but not at the beginning? <body> I am using picture-in-picture in an iMovie and it works great except that I can't seem to figure out if there is a way I can have a different transition into the PIP versus out of it at the end.  There seems to only be one selection where I can choice time and transition (like dissolve) and it applies that to strongboth/strong the beginning and end.  Is there any way to have a different transition in versus out of a picture in picture in iMovie?  <answer254475> Yes. On iMovie 10.1.2 for macOS, all you need to do is hold the kbdoption/kbd key while dragging one of the picture-in-picture fade markers. Here's a video demo:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/PBeBzqb.gif" alt="iMovie PIP"  (strongNote:/strong Press image for full size.)  <comment284345> What exact version of iMovie on which platform (OS X or iOS)? <comment284359> latest version of both <comment318009> Did my answer help? Need anything else?
