Is it possible to modify/update the Wikipedia support in older Dictionary app versions (vers. 2.2.3)? <body> I have an older Mac that can't be upgraded beyond OS X 10.7.5. As a heavy user of the Dictionary app I'm unhappy with the now messed-up display of Wikipedia content and defunct hyperlinks, the cause of which I assume to be changes made on the side of Wikipedia.   As Apple has stopped supporting OS X 10.7, I'm willing to hack it if possible. I've seen the Wikipedia JavaScript and CSS files within the Dictionary application bundle, I know how to handle TextWrangler, I have some understanding of CSS, but I'm not really versed in JavaScript.  <comment276032> Interesting question, I'm interested in hearing the answer, but you may just want to upgrade to a newer Mac, not just for a better Dictionary app, but for new features, security updates, stability enhancements, new design, and more.
