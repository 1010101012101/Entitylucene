Can I use a Mac Mini as an Airplay audio receiver? <body> I don't have an AppleTV (yet), but I do have a Mac Mini hooked up to some decent speakers.  Is there something I can run on it, so that it acts like an Airplay audio receiver?  (Video support isn't important to me.)  <answer61959> Both AirServer and Reflector allow your Mac to act as an Airplay receiver for audio or video. I'm not aware of an app that specializes in audio only Airplay, but either of those should do what you need.  <answer61960> Rogue Amoeba's Airfoil (which transmits Airplay from a Mac) is also very reliable, and includes Airfoil Speakers to receive Airplay from other sources. I recommend it highly.  <answer110307> From https://code.google.com/p/open-airplay/ (note they also support audio):  ul liAirServer: The best app for turning your Mac into an AirPlay screen ($15)   /li liReflector: Turn your Mac or PC into an AirPlay screen ($13)/li liBanana TV: Another app to turn your Mac into and AirPlay screen (&lt;= iOS 5.0)/li liCasual Share: Mac AirPlay receiever/li liAirMac: Turns you Macintosh into an Airplay receiver (Objective C)/li liAirstream Media Player: C# based AirPlay screen for windows and AirPlay server source code/li liPlay2Wifi: An AirPlay server written in Python (&lt; iOS 4.3)/li /ul  And as Christian says, AirFoil Speakers should also do the trick ($25 / 10 minute trial).  I personally had problems with AirServer (kept crapping out) and Reflector only gives you a 10 minute trial, which isn't enough.  <answer135050> Xbmc supports being an airplay receiver and runs on macs.  http://xbmc.org/  <answer190522> Proprietary:  ul liAirServer - audio and streaming, Mac/Windows, $15/li liReflector - audio and streaming, Mac/Windows/Android, $15/li liAirFoil - audio only, Mac/Windows/Linux, $30 for Mac/Win, $40 for both, free for linux/li /ul  Open Source:  ul licasualShare audio and streaming, Java + NodeJS, open source/li liAirStream (Ruby) - audio and streaming, source only/li liKodi - formerly XBMC, audio and streaming, Mac/Windows/Linux+, open source/li liShairport Sync - audio only (multi-room), source only (C/make); this is the not-dead version of Shairport/li /ul  Dead:  ul liAirPlay for Totem - audio and streaming/li liAirMac, on GitHub - audio and streaming, source only (Objective-C)/li liAirStream (C#) - audio and streaming, source only/li liShairport - audio only, source only (C/make + perl)/li liBanana TV audio and streaming, Mac, free, but emonly supports iOS 4.2 through 4.3.5/em/li /ul  <comment71549> Airfoil is for sending audio *from* the Mac, not to it. Good program though. <comment71602> @CanuckSkier But you can send audio to a Mac using Airfoil and [Airfoil Speakers](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/speakers.php) <comment71603> Cool, didn't actually know that existed, thanks! If video isn't a requirement, that's a great option. <comment146275> +1 for AirServer, it does allow you to play audio, video and mirroring. (with 7 days trial period, nice people there) <comment218301> Notice: it currently support audio only for iOS7, and also its name is changed to Kodi.
