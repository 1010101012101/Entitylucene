In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.   Generally there are no consequences of this for you. If you build your own software and it requires this formula, you'll need to add to your build variables:      LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/readline/include /code/pre  This package installs manpages:  precode&gt; brew ls -v readline | grep man /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/info/rluserman.info /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/history.3 /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/readline.3 /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/readline/fileman.c /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/readline/manexamp.c /code/pre  I can't see the manual. I get codeNo manual entry for readline/code.  Howto view the manual with codeman readline/code?  <answer263498> The code-M/code option for codeman/code allows you to specify a path. The exact command you're looking for is:  precodeman -M 3 /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/readline.3 /code/pre  Note that the number after the code-M/code specifies the "codeman/code page section", which is the last character in the file path. For example, I have two versions of codesshd/code installed and I read can both their codeman/code pages with the following commands:  precodeman -M 8 /usr/share/man/man8/sshd.8 man -M 8 /usr/local/Cellar/openssh/7.3p1/share/man/man8/sshd.8 /code/pre  I'm curious why codebrew/code didn't symlink codereadline/code, since codebrew/code's codereadline/code is the only one installed - presumably past versions (I'm on Sierra) of macOS emdid/em have codereadline/code? I'd tend to be conservative here, and honour codebrew/code's decision as far as possible - just in case Apple decide to install codereadline/code again with a future OS upgrade. That being said, you could manually symlink codereadline/code:  precodeln -s /usr/local/Cellar/readline/7.0.1/share/man/man3/readline.3 /usr/local/share/man/man3/readline.3 /code/pre  The risk with this is that - if Apple do install codereadline/code in the future - you'll end up with Apple's codereadline/code in your $PATH (and not codebrew/code's, since it's keg-only and hasn't been linked), but codebrew/code's codereadline/code will occur first in your $MANPATH, before the codeman/code page for Apple's codereadline/code.
