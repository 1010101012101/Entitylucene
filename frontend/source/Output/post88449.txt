Can I share my iMac's internet access to iPhone via USB? <body> I have an iMac, connected to the Internet via Ethernet, and an iPhone 4. I would like to share the iMac's Internet connection to my iPhone via the USB Cable (because my wife dreams of a wifi-less household).  I've set up Internet Sharing, specifying "sharing from: Ethernet  via: USB IPhone", but when I test, the iPhone cannot connect to the Internet. Is there something I need to activate on the iPhone?   iMac, mac os x version: Mountain Lion, 10.8.4 iPhone 4, IOS Version: 6.1  <answer88450> I do not know of any method that exists at this point in time. It would only be possible with a jailbroken device as Apple doesn't offer this feature.  <answer100357> Apple does offer this feature, otherwise it will not allow us to set it up in the first place. Came on here with the same problem...   <answer100363> From the iPhone / iOS perspective, USB tethering only works in one direction - internet service can flow out of the device but not in to the device.  A cellular data device is capable of turning on tethering whereby it will serve as a router for one device that connects over USB. Even though Mac OS will offer to do the same, iOS will not listen for an active Internet connection over USB and only will tether to a computer over Wi-Fi.  On a technical level, USB is an asymmetrical protocol with one host that communicates to all downstream endpoints. Just like you can connect a USB hard drive to a computer but not reverse that flow and get the hard drive to act as the host and the computer to act as the drive (even though many hard drives now have computers in them and your computer could work as a hard drive and just store data - this is exactly how Target Disk mode sharing works over Firewire and Thunderbolt and other symmetrical protocols like ethernet, Wi-Fi and potentially Bluetooth).  Practically - your Mac will tether to an iPhone/iPad and can receive internet service over USB, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. In the reverse direction for the software you list, only Wi-Fi is viable for the Mac to share it's internet to the iPhone (or iOS device).  <answer125313> You used to be able to do Bluetooth PAN sharing to all iDevices. Now, it appears it works sporadically for iPad device only. Most iPhones are reported as not working. It was working at one point, and Genius Bar verified that it is no longer supported. Apple may view their icloud functionality as trumping and making computer-to-iDevice connections unnecessary.  <answer158237> You may have to reboot your Mac.  Share Ethernet via Wifi (do not tell your wife) When it works, the wifi icon on the Mac is a fan with an exclamation mark on it.  <answer216191> Yes you can share your ethernet, usb dongle internet with your iphone/ipad devices. Just came across this how-to: How to share a Wi-Fi connection from a Mac to an iPhone. Hope this helps for you and other folks who are facing this issue.  <answer232937> strongIt is possible/strong by using Apple's development tool what is usually used to intercept app's traffic, but it also do iPhone→Mac→Internet tethering.  Remote Packet Capture for iOS devices is about sniffing apps' traffic, but there is also easy step-by-step guide how to send traffic throught Mac. Just follow paragraphs between "Remote Virtual Interfaces" and "Using tcpdump" headers.  If command codervictl/code is missing in your computer, you probably need to install the command line tools included in Xcode.  <answer263427> you can also share IMac Ethernet to Ipad/Iphone over an addtional Ethernet cable, but it requires second Ethernet port /Ethernet Switch, a powered USB Hub and an additional Ethernet Adapter, plus a standard micro/usb cable, as shown here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKp02y4JXVs Not very elegant, but functional. Blutooth Tethering works also, but mainly with Ipads and Android Devices.  <answer284442> The method you described will share your internet connection to your iPhone on recent Mac and iPhones. Specifically, on macOS Sierra, follow the instructions on https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25327?locale=en_US but choose to share your internet to computers using "iPhone USB".  ol liOpen System Preferences, click Sharing/li liEnable Internet Sharing by clicking the checkbox/li liIn the “Share your connection from” pop-up menu select Ethernet (or Thunderbolt Ethernet on MacBooks using the Thunderbolt-Ethernet adapter)/li liIn the “To computers using” list select iPhone USB./li /ol  <comment103554> How did you set up that Internet Connection Sharing? Which OS are you using? Could you upload a screen capture? <comment103629> Settings  Sharing  Share Internet Connection. <comment103644> That way you're sharing the internet connection of your iPhone into your Computer, not the other way round. <comment103822> so you mean i should set it up as "sharing from: USB Iphone via: Ethernet" ? <comment118116> This might need some more explanation, since plainly it doesn't work. iOS hardware has never accepted an Internet connection coming in over USB even though it is happy to send an Internet connection out from USB. <comment265017> That link was for sharing a non-wifi connection with an iPhone using the Mac as a wifi router.  Not quite an answer to the original question, as the Author wanted a "wifi-less household". <comment265554> Wife unhappy with most-voted being Wi-Fi via Mac. <comment298329> @pixeline : not work for "iPhone USB". Only Wi-Fi or Bluetooth <comment310029> 52000 views and Apple still doesn't care to enable this feature. Sometimes cellular and WiFi both aren't decent options. I know it is theoretically possible though, my old Pocket PC used to have internet from USB. <comment330024> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment350930> There is no technical limitation. With the right program installed on a jailbroken iPhone you could easily do such a reverse-tether through USB. <comment358699> This does not provide an answer to the question.

This is helpful to know for anybody coming across this question in 2017. <comment359126> @Allan Since my answer was not of high quality, I attempted to improve it and hope you take my comments into account as to why this contributes to this question, especially as this is one of the first hits on Google searching for internet sharing to iPhone <comment359127> If the goal is to not have WiFi, it does look like there are ethernet adaptors for iOS devices. You would just need a wired router instead of a WiFi router, or a WiFi router with some extra ethernet ports that allow you to turn off the WiFi signal. (Not an answer as it doesn't involve USB) <comment359646> +1, This worked for me, MacBook Air (early 2015), Mac OS Sierra 10.12.5, shared wifi connection (GoGoInflight) to USB-tethered iPhone 6s running iOS 10.3.2.  Thanks for the tip! <comment363715> This actually works!!
