The keyboard and trackpad on my MacBook Pro 3,1 stopped working. How to solve this problem? <body> The keyboard and trackpad on my macbook pro 3.1 stopped working after having frozen the operating system and reboot.  On my Mac I have Windows installed BootCamp and neither does the keyboard and trackpad.  However, I work a keyboard and mouse connect via USB external. You do not know if it really is a problem hardware or software.  <answer69972> For some possible solutions check out:  strongSolution 1/strong  http://gigaom.com/apple/the-curious-case-of-the-missing-macbook-pro-keyboard-and-trackpad/     If the warranty on your MacBook Pro is no longer valid, like mine,   don’t worry. Simply take a small piece of paper, such as a Post-It,   and fold it in half. Stick it over the spot on the ribbon cable. Then   reinstall the removable battery. The battery should exert enough   pressure on the piece of paper to keep the ribbon cable working.      If your MacBook Pro is still under warranty, take it to an Apple   service center. While Apple has not officially acknowledged that this   is a widespread problem, it’s afflicted the machines of many owners,   so surely it’s not unknown to them. Demonstrate the steps described   above to whomever is helping you as letting him or her see the problem   as it happens eliminates the guesswork and may help expedite the time   needed for repairs.   strongSolution 2/strong  http://jasonrobb.com/v2/2008/11/24/macbook-pro-unresponsive-keyboard-trackpad-solution/     THE FIX? I rolled up a sticky note and placed it on top of the cable.   When the battery is locked in place, it puts pressure on the cable,   and makes the keyboard and trackpad functional.   strongSolution 3 (Apple)/strong  Apple support forum dedicated solely to this issue: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1365569?start=270&amp;tstart=0     strongTHE SOLUTION:/strong      This is a HARDWARE problem!      After playing around with removing the battery and noticing that this   often returned functionality to the keyboard I surmised that this had   some sort of physical aspect. Sure enough, there is a section of   copper colored tape/wiring exposed in the batter slot that is slightly   bowed where it's smallest. When I depressed this with my finger tip on   this portion to basically flatten it out flush against the housing; I   found that all functionality was restored!   <comment47562> Does the power button work? <comment47734> Yes, the power button work. The only is not working is the keyborad and trackpad of my MacBook Pro. The USB ports is working too. <comment47745> What happens when you press the power button and hold the alt/option button? <comment47829> Any key on the keyboard is freze. The power button is the only button that work in the keyboard. <comment81311> Hello, and welcome to Ask Different!
