permanently changing MTU size on utun interface <body> I identified a problem of my OpenVPN client often disconnecting to be the size of MTU defaultly set at 1500. I can't figure out how to change it permanently as codesudo ifconfig utun1 mtu xxxx/code only sets the value until the interface is disconnected. Is there a way to change it permanently?  Also, since I am using OpenVPN client app, there are no .conf/.ovpn files to edit, or at least not that I am aware of.  Thank you for any suggestions.
