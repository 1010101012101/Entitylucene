Install automator service via command line <body> I would like to automate my Mac installation flow for services. The following is my script:  precode#!/bin/sh rm -rf ./tempWorkflows mkdir tempWorkflows for filename in ./*.workflow; do     cp -R "$filename" ./tempWorkflows/"$filename" done for filename in ./tempWorkflows/*.workflow; do     open $filename done rm -rf ./tempWorkflows /code/pre  It basically copy all my code*.workflow/code and open it. However, for codeopen $filename/code, it prompts and asking for a confirmation:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pggnI.png" alt="popup"  Is there a way to add code--no-prompt/code or similar flag for the open command?  EDIT:  I am using El Capitan 10.11.3  <answer227013> If strongAutomator/strong is closed then open strongAutomator/strong and select strongApplication/strong under strongChoose a type for your document/strong, then click the strongChoose/strong button. If it's already open the choose strongFile/strong  strongNew/strong and select strongApplication/strong under strongChoose a type for your document/strong.  Add a strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em to it.  Copy and paste the emshell code/em you presently have into the strongRun Shell Script/strong emAction/em.  Add the following lines of emcode/em after: codeopen $filename/code  precodesleep 1 osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to click button "Install" of window "Service Installer" of process "Automator"' sleep 1 osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to click button "Done" of window "Service Installer" of process "Automator"' /code/pre  Note: You should also add an appropriate codecd/code line above the coderm -rf ./tempWorkflows/code line you presently have in your emcode/em, e.g. codecd /some/directory/path/code where it's the empathname/em of the location your code.workflow/code files are located for processing by your emscript/em.   Save the strongAutomator Application/strong as strongInstall Automator Service/strong. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uDLqT.png" alt="Install Automator Service" strongNext:/strong  Open strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongSecurity &amp; Privacy/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  strongPrivacy/strong  Click the strongLock/strong icon to make changes and type in your password, then click the strongUnlock/strong button.  User the strong[+]/strong to add the strongInstall Automator Service/strong or drag and drop the application bundle into the window. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Op2oR.png" alt="Accessibility" This will now allow the strongInstall Automator Service/strong application to run your emshell code/em and use the AppleScript emcode/em to click the strongInstall/strong button and subsequent strongDone/strong button on the strongService Installer/strong dialog box in the process of installing your emServices/em.  <comment275700> It's doable however depending on the version of OS X you're running will have bearing on the implementation of the method. <comment275701> Updated Mac OS info. I am using 10.11.3, thanks <comment275705> This can be done using either AppleScript or Automator creating an application bundle as this will be necessary to allow the App to control your computer by clicking the Install and Done buttons on the Service Installer dialog box.  Doing an Automator app probably would be easiest, using a Run Shell Script _Action_ and a couple lines of AppleScript _code_ using `osascript` by adding a few lines after the `open $filename` line. If your interested I'll create an answer for it however I do not have OS X 10.11 although this does work in OS X 10.10 it should also work in OS X 10.11. Let me know. <comment275751> BTW You should have quotes around `$filename` in `open "$filename"` in case any of your Automator Services `.workflow` files have spaces in the names.
