How to restore bash history function in macOS Sierra <body> I installed Sierra OS on my iMac without any troubles. But, when I open Terminal, I can't scroll through the bash history when pressing the up arrow.  <answer257085> Have a look at code/etc/bashrc_Apple_Terminal/code. The file contains comments that explain how to disable bash_sessions:  precode# The save/restore mechanism is disabled if the following file exists: # # ~/.bash_sessions_disable /code/pre  or just disable their shell history mechanism  precode# You may disable this behavior and share a single history by setting # SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 0. There are some common user customizations # that arrange to share new commands among running shells by # manipulating the history at each prompt, and they typically include # 'shopt -s histappend'; therefore, if the histappend shell option is # enabled, per-session history is disabled by default. You may # explicitly enable it by setting SHELL_SESSION_HISTORY to 1. /code/pre  <answer257127> You can perhaps also restore the (hidden) em.bash_history/em  file from the TimeMachine backup Found in the HomeFolder.  <comment320809> I am assuming you mean, "scroll through the bash history when pressing the up arrow."  Is that correct?
