Best Note Application Integrated With Exchange For IPad 2 <body> I am looking for a note taking application that needs to be integrated with MS Exchange, because i am using an iPad, a notebook running Windows 7 and MacBook Pro.   ul liI want to be able to take notes, create tasks and access them from all devices./li /ul  Is there any program that meets these requirements?  <answer64010> Why does it have to be integrated with Exchange? Would a third-party service work?  Like SimpleNote. It has a web interface - so you can access it from any computer-, strongan universal app/strong (iPhone + iPad) and many other strongthird party app/strong for Windows and OS X.  <answer64019> I've seen posts that say if you are synced to Exchange, the built-in Reminders app will sync your tasks; there is a slider for it in the Exchange setup. As far as a third-party app, try IMExchange2, it appears to sync tasks and notes.  <comment74149> This seems Ok for me. Thanks
