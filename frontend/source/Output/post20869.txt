What does the new command on the f4-key do? <body> I used to have a dashboard icon, which opened the dashboard when clicked on my keyboard.  But now there is another image, which does nothing when clicked.  What is it supposed to do?  How to I fix it?  How do I alternative assign it to dashboard again?

If it doesn't do anything, see if Show Launchpad is checked in the Keyboard preference pane:  img src="https://i.imgur.com/PLHip.jpg" alt=""  It doesn't have to be assigned to any regular shortcut though.  <comment22891> I have lion, f4 not working anyway <comment22892> What does clear do? <comment22893> disabled in the keyboard shortcut preference setting? <comment22894> Nope, and I have found the solution: `rm ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.symbolichotkeys.plist` <comment22899> give it a try in the calculator application where it will perform the function of the C key. <comment22906> @Tyilo Why not post the solution as an answer here? :) <comment22922> need 100 repo or wait 8 hour after this question was posted
