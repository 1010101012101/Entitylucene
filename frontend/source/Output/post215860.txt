List failed login attempts on Yosemite <body> I want to see if somebody has tried to log in on my computer, which is running Yosemite. I am primarily interested in tracking ssh log in attempts, as well as tracking people physically typing passwords on my keyboard to try to log in.  strongClosely related/strong  List failed login attempts on Mavericks  <answer215861> emThis answer is based on this one, but that answer does not list ssh attempts on Yosemite/em  Here is a start  precodegrep "authentication error for" /private/var/log/system.log /code/pre  This probably lists all failed login attempts via ssh. The answer in the linked answer still works; you can use  precodegrep "Failed to authenticate user" /private/var/log/system.log /code/pre  to see failed local login attempts. This does not include login attempts from a terminal window. It does include failed attempts to "switch user".  <answer238177> sshd logging is determined in code/etc/asl/com.openssh.sshd/code.  In short, you need to touch a file and then send syslogd a HUP signal:br codetouch /var/run/com.openssh.sshd-asl-enabled/codebr codekill -HUP $(ps -ef | grep [s]yslogd | awk '{print $2}')/code  After that, you will find the logs in code/var/log/sshd.log/code
