Connect to my mac from my Ubuntu failed! <body> I have turned on the remote login in system-preference, but I got this when I try to connect my mac from from my ubuntu. Any ideas?  precode$ ssh -vvv lakeat@129.74.164.130 OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012 debug1: Reading configuration data /home/danny/.ssh/config debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 19: Applying options for * debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0 debug1: Connecting to 129.74.164.130 [129.74.164.130] port 22. debug1: Connection established. debug3: Incorrect RSA1 identifier debug3: Could not load "/home/danny/.ssh/id_rsa" as a RSA1 public key debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 debug1: Checking blacklist file /usr/share/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048 debug1: Checking blacklist file /etc/ssh/blacklist.RSA-2048 debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_ecdsa type -1 debug1: identity file /home/danny/.ssh/id_ecdsa-cert type -1 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.9 debug1: match: OpenSSH_5.9 pat OpenSSH* debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1 debug2: fd 3 setting O_NONBLOCK debug3: load_hostkeys: loading entries for host "129.74.164.130" from file "/home/danny/.ssh/known_hosts" debug3: load_hostkeys: loaded 0 keys debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent Connection closed by 129.74.164.130 /code/pre  <answer105247> Looking at the output there seems to be some problem with your RSA keys. I did look up this and read a comment over at Superuser: https://superuser.com/questions/408565/i-am-getting-this-error-ssh-exchange-identification where they talk about, that you have to allow your user to log-in, inside the sshd_config file on the computer you are connecting to (in your case your OSX computer):  precodesudo nano /etc/sshd_config AllowUsers yourname@* /code/pre  I've never encountered this problem myself but it's worth a shot in my opinion.  <comment123751> On my mac or my Ubuntu? <comment123754> It's on the OSX one (the one you connect to). Clarification edit done in answer. <comment123756> I tried, but to no avail. Same error msg as before <comment123757> You could try the first comment on the post by switching to type 2 RSA key with adding -2 to the ssh call : `ssh -2 ...` <comment123761> I end up with the same message with "ssh -2 -vvv lakeat@129.74.164.130" <comment123773> Are both machines on the same network? No firewalls in between?
