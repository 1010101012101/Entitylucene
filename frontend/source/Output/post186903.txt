Is there a Terminal command that will list the current admin account? <body> Does anyone know of a terminal command which lists the current administrator account?  <answer186909> Users who have administrative privileges on OS X belong to the group codeadmin/code. There's no straight forward way to list members of a group as OS X uses Open Directory to manage these things and it's a bit convoluted as a result.  Here is a shell function that will give you all the members of a group. It was taken from this SuperUser.com Q&amp;A:  precodemembers () {   dscl . -list /Users | while read user; do     printf "$user "     dsmemberutil checkmembership -U "$user" -G "$*"   done | grep "is a member" | cut -d " " -f 1; }; /code/pre  Save that in your ~/.bash_profile or just cut and paste it to a bash or zsh prompt and then you can run:  precodemembers admin /code/pre  and you'll get a list of accounts that have administrator privileges on the machine.  <comment220786> Now, I’m confused. I was under the impression that a `User` who is an `admin` belongs to the group `staff` <comment220788> @njboot this is incorrect. You can inspect the sudo setup on an OS X machine to convince yourself of this. If you do `sudo visudo` you will see that elevated privs are available to accounts in the `%admin` group, not `%staff`. That makes the `admin` group the group you need to be in to administer an OS X machine. <comment220793> @njboot for an explanation of the `staff` group see: http://superuser.com/a/20430/26633 <comment220794> Thanks for the clarification. Reading the explanation now. Regards. <comment220802> I deleted my answer, hence leaving this comment here -- the explanation you gave (as comment, on my said deleted answer) makes perfect sense. It’s assumed that because I can `su` to `root` I belong to the group `admin`. However, one not need belong to the group `admin` to execute `root` privileges — (this should probably be deleted, just responding to your comment. Thanks again. Cheers). <comment220830> Spectacular! thanks a lot
