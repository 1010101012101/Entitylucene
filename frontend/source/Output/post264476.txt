A strange border at macOS Preview <body> When I'm opening a PDF-file in macOS Preview I got some annoying white borders in full-screen mode. Does anybody know how I can get rid of this annoying borders?  It's about the borders you see at the bottom and on the right, there's no scrolling needed they're still there.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYvmR.png" alt="Preview Bug"  <answer264748> I found the solution by myself. I disabled scrollbars under System Preferences  General  Scrollbars and set it to 'When scrolling' instead of 'Always'.
