trouble with apple mac pro 13" retina display <body> I just bought an apple mac pro retina display 13", I set up my apple account but changed my password on my phone, I came to log back in on my laptop and it wouldn't let me with my new password, I tired my old password but it still didn't work. I did a factory restore on it and It seemed to work, but I then noticed it deleted apps that where already installed on the computer such as iMovie, when I go on to the app store it now askes me to pay for these. im not sure what I should do, any advice?   <answer178936> For apps that were included with your Mac, launch the App store and login with your Apple ID. Check under the "Updates" section and see if the apps appear there, with "Accept" appearing where the "Update" button normally would be (to the right).  If you cannot access them that way, check your purchases by going to the "Purchases" section in the Mac App store. They may have already been accepted under your Apple ID.  If both options above fail, open a case with Apple Support. They can verify your ownership of the computer and can issue download codes and/or reset the purchase to your AppleID and you will be able to retrieve them that way.  <comment211998> If you log in with your Apple ID on the App Store there's a Purchased section where you should be able to download iMovie, iPhoto and so on
