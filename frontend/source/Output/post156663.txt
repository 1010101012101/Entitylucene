iPhone 4 requires previous Apple ID <body> I bought a used iPhone 4, got the carrier to unlock to use, but I still can't use because I don't have the previous owner's Apple ID or password. Is there any way to unlock to use?  <answer156680> I am sorry, but you cannot use your iPhone without entering the code correctly.
