How can I simply and quickly upload just 1 photo from my iPhone to a PC or Mac? <body> This is really frustrating. Occasionally, my work requires me to upload a photo from my iPhone (ios7) to a clients PC or Mac. I used to simply email it to my Gmail account and download it from the web but for whatever reason I can no longer do this (seems I can no longer email something to my self via Mac mail).  I've got Photostream set up but I cant access it via iCloud - theres just no photo option.  Obviously my clients PCs dont always have iPhoto (which is a huge pain to use anyway).  Why isnt there a simple way to transfer a photo from my phone to a computer via Bluetooth or USB?  Is there just a simple, non-proprietry software solution for transferring just 1 photo between devices?  <answer141709> I would recommend Pushbullet. You can send just about any message or file between a phone and a computer extremely simply. The catch is that the receiver of the pushbullet must have the Pushbullet chrome extension installed.  <answer141710> The most efficient way would be to use Box or Dropbox. If you're looking for a "just works" solution, iCloud drive in iOS 8 and OS X 10.10 Yosemite would also work.  <answer141734> You can email it as an attachment to another email address. For emailing single photos, I got around this problem by setting up a secondary email account and emailing it to myself there. Then I checked the email account from my laptop. For multiple pictures, I had to use a windows machine (Windows 7). I just plugged the iphone into the PC's USB and it worked, reading it as a data drive.  It may also work to save it as an attachment in a draft message. Then synch accounts and look in the drafts folder of your computer.
