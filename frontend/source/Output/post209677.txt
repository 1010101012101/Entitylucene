Kill Apps Using Too Much RAM <body> I have unfortunately been saddled with a developer laptop that isn't fast enough. Is there any app which can flag apps which use up too much RAM and prompt me so I can kill them ?  For eg: Xcode , iOS Simulator can end up using upto 10 GB RAM in some cases. So I want to kill them and start over in those cases.  <comment252916> Do you want an automatic process or something that alerts you to the increased memory use? Are you familiar with any scripting languages? <comment252951> There is a free app called memory clean that allows you to free most of the mac's inactive memory, I use it all the time on my developper laptop. It doesn't kill apps for that you can use the 'Force an app to close' by clicking (command+option+esc) or use the activity monitor. <comment253032> @maetsoh - if I'm reading the OP correctly, the memory wouldn't be inactive. Having said that, I'm not sure of killing any app that starts to use a bit of RAM is going to really be productive - think about if you killed Final Cut Pro for using all your RAM when transcoding your output video... you'd never get finished, as that's what it does by design.
