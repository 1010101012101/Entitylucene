iPod touch (iOS4) doesn't sync AddressBook after moving to iCloud <body> I moved from MobileMe to iCloud. So my iPod2gn blocked in iOS4 is not part of the sync anymore. Well, it's a technical and commercial shame, but well, ok, enough said.  I wanted to be able to have my Calendar and Address book sync by iTunes when I plug my iPod to my iMac.  It works for emails, photos, calendars BUT not the AddressBook.  Is this a known issue or am I missing some basic stuff here?  <answer52034> Apparently, after moving to iCloud, iTunes won't sync Address Book with an iOS4 device, as there is some sort of emissue/em with folder paths.   This is the only thing I could find addressing your problem.  <answer59443> This isn't directly what you asked for, but it might help:  You can sync your Address Book and Calendar to a GMail account. Google's instructions for this are fine, so I won't repeat them here. If you sync your Mac/PC to the GMail contacts as well, this will give you similar functionality to iCloud, even on iOS4.
