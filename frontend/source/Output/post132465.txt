My project has disappeared from iMovie -- can you help me get it back? <body> I have been working on a project on iMovie and yesterday I opened iMovie to continue working on it but I can't find it.  It says I have two projects but it only shows me one project and I am freaking out because I am suppose to show this video at my graduation for my whole school and every things gone but I don't know where it went.  Can you please help me find out where it went and get it back?  <answer132487> This is truly SPF event.  OK, Using Finder look in this folders for your file.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9EQmT.png" alt="Klass 6B-9B"  To modify the side bar click on Finder- preferences and then select Movie Folder like this  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nepQS.png" alt="finder"  This could be also a case of mistaken identity.  For example I have 2 versions of the iMovie application. the version 9 and the version 10.  See if you have that as well, since the movies/projects are not saved in same location.  <answer132498> Open Finder, on the far left of your Dock, then click "Applications" on the sidebar, then double-click "Utilities", then "Terminal". In the window that shows up, paste this in:  precodeterm="$(osascript -e 'text returned of (display dialog "What do you want to find?" default answer "rcproject")')"; d=0; for x in $(find ~ -iregex ".*$term.*" | sed 's/ /\ /g'); do let d++; osascript -e 'on run argv' -e 'tell app "Finder" to reveal (POSIX file (item 1 of argv) as string)' -e end "$x" &gt;/dev/null; if [[ d -gt 10 ]]; then echo "Press Control-C to quit."; fi done; if [[ $d -ne 0 ]]; then open -a Finder; else v="$(osascript -e 'button returned of (display dialog "No files were found. Try again looking everywhere?")')"; if [[ $v = OK ]]; then for x in $(find / -iregex ".*$term.*" 2&gt;/dev/null | sed 's/ /\ /g'); do let d++; osascript -e 'on run argv' -e 'tell app "Finder" to reveal (POSIX file (item 1 of argv) as string)' -e end "$x" &gt;/dev/null; done; open -a Finder; fi; fi; open ~/Movies/ #END /code/pre  supIf you're having trouble selecting it all, double-click the first word ("term"), then scroll all the way to the right, then hold shift and click on where it says "END"./sup  Press kbdreturn ↩/kbd if another window doesn't show up.  Then, the window should ask what you want to find. Leave what's in there at first, because codercproject/code should match all iMovie files. If it says it couldn't find any files, click OK. If it emstill/em couldn't find any files (it might take a long time to look), then repeat the above with something else (like Klass 6B-9B). I doubt you will find anything else, unfortunately.  A Finder window will pop up with your Movies folder. If any others show up behind it, try dragging those things (only code.rcproject/codes will work for this) into the iMovie Projects folder in that window.  I don't know where it says you have two projects, but if this doesn't work, it's possible that the file got corrupted somehow…  <answer236920> I just found my project! imovie quit unexpectedly and then I opened it back up, selected "all projects" in the left column and when I clicked on the thumbnail for the video i got back to the editing screen with all my edits! SOOOOO happy right now, hope this works for someone else too!! xo Krissy  <comment156853> "SPF event" -- what's that? <comment156860> [I made a chat room for you](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14836/discussion-with-buscar-and-user79432). Please use it to discuss your problem and not the comment feature of the site. Thanks. <comment156865> @Buscar웃 i did what you said i am suppose to do but i didn't find it all it says in the movie folder is imovie library,imovie theater and motion templates <comment156869> This might be stupid but do you have 2 iMovie applications. Look under applications. <comment156889> @user79432 you *should* be able to join that [chat room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/14836/discussion-with-buscar-and-user79432) now. Sorry that took so long to sort out.
