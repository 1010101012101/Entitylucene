External monitor has no signal on first boot — Mac must be rebooted <body> I'm on a Mac Pro running OS X 10.9 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 512 MB, and I'm using a BenQ E2420HD as a monitor.  The Problem: Every day I start my Mac in the morning, and every day the monitor has no signal the first time I start the computer. The only thing that works is to shut the Mac Pro off by holding the power button down for a few seconds. As I start it for the second time, the monitor gets a signal and everything works. That happens every day and it's very bothering, and probably also bad for the Mac Pro.  ul liI tried plugging the monitor cable out and in again and manually setting the input in the monitor menu — not working./li liI also reset the SMC and NVRAM — nothing changed./li liI had the monitor connected via DVI-DVI and then changed to HDMI-MiniDisplayPort because I thought that might help — nope./li /ul  This problem occurred in OS X 10.8 as well as it does now in 10.9. It's very frustrating!  <comment331251> Did you ever resolve this? I'm having the same issue with my late 2014 mac mini.
