Default From address in iOS Mail <body> I have multiple e-mail addresses associated with My Contact on my iPhone (6S, iOS 10.0.2). Some of those e-mail addresses are for accounts on the phone and some are for accounts not on the phone.  If I set the default mail account in iOS using codeSettings-&gt;Mail-&gt;Default Account/code, this does not directly control the codeFrom/code address selection of the outgoing mail. Probably this makes sense, because the codeFrom/code address can be set independently of the account used to send. Most advice I find in other questions/Web search only centres on this setting, which doesn't appear to be the only thing which is relevant.  When I compose a new e-mail, the selected codeFrom/code address is by default one which is a) not for the default account in Settings; b) not even an account which is setup on the phone. This is very undesirable.  As I enter the recipient name, the codeFrom/code address sometimes changes. It can change to at least 3 other values (all from My Contact, all from accounts on the phone). This could possibly be learning behaviour based on previously sent e-mails. These choices are often not ideal but better than the default choice.  How is the codeFrom/code address selection controlled? Can I at least control the default, even if the "intelligent" behaviour cannot be controlled? The default is almost always a poor choice for me, and I have to remember to manually check the choice and switch it every time.
