How can I know which MySQL install is started with the PrefPane in the System Preferences? <body> I forgot that I installed several MySQL (or MariaDB) packages on my Mac, such as rpm or source code packages.  You know the Mac's System Preference has a MySQL quick start/stop panel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oCWos.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  How do I know which MySQL install it is using?  <comment373066> The PrefPane is "hard wired" to /usr/local/mysql which is a symlink to /usr/local/mysql-version-macos-version... (usually the Oracle MySQL installer). <comment373068> @klanomath Thank you, I got it. <comment373266> @klanomath This is an answer. <comment373549> @klanomath If you get a chance, you should turn your comment into an answer. It seems to have answered the question for the OP and may help others. :)
