How do delete selective iCloud book copy? <body> I dont want few icloud book copies to be occupying my screen space. Is there anyway possible, going to the folder directly on Mac, to delete the copy of the ibooks?  I can see numerous answers of hiding and some answering that it is not possible. Are there any hacks around?  Is it possible to COMPLETELY delete a Book from my purchased books?  <answer186477> Right Click  Deletebr "Are you sure you want to delete this book from your Mac?"br Delete.  It's in the Trash.
