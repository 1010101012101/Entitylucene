Mac wakes on scheduled power event that recreates itself every day <body> At 2:14 every morning, my Mac wakes. Looking at the logs, I see it's a scheduled event, but nothing shows up in System Preferences  Power. When I go to terminal, and run pmset -g sched, I see  precodeScheduled power events: [0]  wake at 03/31/13 02:14:00 /code/pre  Only one, for the next event. I can delete it through pmset, and it won't wake that night (morning). The next day, there's a new event. So for instance, after that one went, now I see  precodeScheduled power events:  [0]  wake at 04/01/13 02:14:00 /code/pre  I've locked the Power Management preferences, I've even set the com.apple.AutoWake.plist file to remove all write access through chmod, and the next day... a new entry appears.  Taking Lauri's suggestion, I ran opensnoop on the Autowake.plist, and at 2:15, this happened, inserting that power event:  precode2013 Apr  4 02:15:00     0     20 powerd         4 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist  2013 Apr  4 02:15:00     0     20 powerd         5 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist  2013 Apr  4 02:15:00    89  15241 mdworker       4 /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist  /code/pre  I didn't see anything in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or /Library/LaunchAgents/ that seemed relevant. Execsnoop returned  precode2013 Apr  4 02:15:00    89  15241  14058 mdworker 2013 Apr  5 02:15:00    89  24165  19851 mdworker /code/pre  What the heck is going on, and how do I stop this from happening? Or what's the next step to troubleshoot this? Thanks.  Vitals: it's a Mac Mini, 10.8.3, but it's done this for ages (including when migrated from a previous Mac Mini via Time Machine).  <answer87385> The article posted here may help you. It details some plist files to delete that will be recreated on the next power up.  http://tancredi.co.uk/2007/12/9/solving-macbook-wake-from-sleep-issue  <answer87408> Run syslog |grep -i "Wake reason" from the terminal.  Reference this article: http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/17/why-mac-wakes-from-sleep/  <comment102146> Done -- all I see are normal wake-on-keyboard events, like  `$ syslog | grep -i "Wake reason"` `Mar 30 14:12:45 Dereks-Mac-mini kernel[0] Debug: Wake reason: ?` `Mar 31 10:59:36 Dereks-Mac-mini kernel[0] Debug: Wake reason: ?` <comment102148> Thanks. I'll report back and edit this when results are in. Initially, there was no reference to a 02:14 wake event in either file, and after deleting and recreating, the 02:14 event still doesn't show in Power Scheduling/these files, but appears when I do pmset -g sched. <comment102168> What USB devices do you have plugged in?  For me, my unexplained wake up was caused by a usb mouse.  Once I unplugged it, no more issues. <comment102173> Keyboard, mouse. I also would expect if it's USB that it'd show in the wake reason -- was that true for you? <comment102186> Yes, it did show in the console log.  It ended up being my Razer Orochi mouse. <comment102244> This seems to not have helped: the scheduled power event is still being inserted somehow. <comment102245> Right, but did it show as Wake Reason = USB, or what I'm seeing, as Wake Reason: ?. I'm skeptical this is the cause since a USB device might wake it, but is unlikely to be creating a scheduled power event every night for 02:14. <comment102441> Have you checked everything in /Library/LaunchDaemons/ or /Library/LaunchAgents/? You could try running `sudo opensnoop -v -f /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.AutoWake.plist` and `sudo execsnoop -v  exec` in two shells. Or just run `sudo crontab -e` and add something like `*/10 * * * * pmset repeat cancel`. <comment102701> Done, and watching the file offered some new information, thanks. <comment102765> powerd is what modifies the file when you use pmset. The execsnoop command redirects output to a file named `exec`, which might show what other processes start before powerd. <comment103277> Thanks. Done, and added the excerpt from the output. There's nothing around the 02:15 entries that seems consistent (a lot of coreservicesd, mdworker, but not at the same timestamps every night...)
