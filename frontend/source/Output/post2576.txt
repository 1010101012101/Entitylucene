Is there anywhere I can get a complete list of historical Safari release notes? <body> I’ve done a bit of searching for specific Safari version numbers in support.apple.com. Quite a few versions have specific change notes, but it seems like often the versions bundled with major OS X releases aren’t given their own change notes.  ul li1.0: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2964  ul li1.2: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL612 (Dave Hyatt also provided some more detailed notes on the old WebKit blog: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2004_02.html#004874)/li li1.3.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL445/li li1.3.2: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL403/li /ul/li li2.0.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL444/li li3.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25197?viewlocale=en_US  ul li3.1.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL78/li li3.2.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL723/li li3.2.3: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL820/li /ul/li li4.0.5: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL877  ul li4.1: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1045/li li4.1.2: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1069/li /ul/li li5.0: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1046  ul li5.0.2: http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1070/li /ul/li /ul  Also, sometimes Apple’s release notes can be a bit... terse.  I’m trying to figure out which versions of Safari introduced support for HTML5/CSS features.  Wikipedia’s got a great table of releases, but it is a bit vague on CSS improvements (e.g. “improved CSS support”).  <answer2581> This website may help you:  http://caniuse.com/  <answer2618> The Wapedia table you point to appears to just be a less clear version of the Safari version history page on Wikipedia.  This particular search on "When can I use…" appears to display much of what you're looking for.  This page at findmebyip.com also has a good breakdown, although it's not as specific about particular browser versions.  <answer2648> Safari uses Webkit as it's rendering engine. If you're specifically looking for when it began to support HTML5/CSS3, it as a fully open-source repository where you can review changes commit by commit. As such, you can see the full comprehensive, intricately detailed history here: http://trac.webkit.org/timeline  <comment2307> Kind of — I’m more looking for a per-version list of every HTML/CSS feature for which support was added, for each released version of Safari. So something like Safari 2: `video` tag; Safari 3: `` tag and CSS Transforms. Bit hard to reverse-engineer that from caniuse.com. <comment2329> Ah yes, I thought the Wapedia stuff felt a bit Wikipedia-y, I hadn’t noticed the separate Wikipedia page for Safari history. Question updated. <comment2330> When Can I Use and Find Me By IP are getting there, but the former only goes back to 3.2, and the latter only appears to have information on 4 and 5. I’m looking to find out when support for features was introduced, so this only covers stuff that was introduced recently. <comment2364> The problem with that approach is that commits don't say when they each made it into which shipping version of Safari. <comment2377> @Dori - Ah yes, fair point. Hadn't considered that small but important issue! <comment2383> @Dori @Chops: That said, [the Wikipedia Safari version history page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history) gives WebKit version numbers for each Safari release, and some of the commit messages in Trac seem to refer to tags for these WebKit version numbers (see e.g. http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/9369). So it might be possible to retrospectively construct CSS-focused release notes from that.
