Time Machine don't show my old backups after recovery in Mac OS Lion <body> I am using Time Machine.  Then I started Lion in recovery mode with kbdCMD/kbd+ kbdR/kbd and choose "Restore from Time Machine Backup". All worked fined and my Mac started.  But now when I want to use Time Machine again :   ul liI got a message "Time Machine can not complete a backup" : backup is too large for backup disk (it's a partition)./li liI checked the Backup disk and see there are used 200GB and 104GB is free. But for my current Backup I need about 200GB./li liI do not see my old Backups in the Backups.backupdb (also checked with codetmutil listbackups/code)/li /ul  Questions:  ol liHow can I access my old backups which I think they are still on the backup drive but not visible?/li liCan I set the current Backup to use previous (I hope) existing backups to avoid a full backup?/li liIs the only solution is to clean the Backup drive (partition) for upcoming backups and delete previous backups?/li /ol
