Remote not working on new iMac <body> My shiny new late 2012 iMac arrived, but I can't seem to get it to respond to my Apple Remote.   I tried searching the System Preferences to see if out if the box it was paired to another remote, but I can't find that option any more.   I love using my Remote with iTunes and Plex. What can I do?  <answer85242> The new iMac does not have an infrared receiver. You will not be able to use your Apple Remote. For controlling iTunes, I recommend Remote from the App Store. For Plex, I recommend Plex from the App Store.  Whereas in the past Apple promoted the idea of using your Mac as a media hub (hence the inclusion of the Front Row app), I think Apple is now promoting the idea of using an Apple TV instead. It seems like every new hardware refresh is having the infrared capabilities removed.
