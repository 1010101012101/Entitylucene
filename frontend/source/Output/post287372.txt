Newly installed/updated apps crashing on jailbroken 8.3 <body> Using an 8.3 iPhone 6 here.  Two days ago, I found out that any app I've newly installed or updated through the App Store has been crashing immediately upon opening.  If relevant, I picked up AppSync 7.0+ as I was trying to install an ipa file, but it ended up not working (the app). I installed an app from the App Store afterwards and I discovered the problem. I removed AppSync but that didn't affect the crashing. I still have AppSync Unified if relevant.  <comment365111> It's been a while since I've used AppSync variants, but as far as I know, AppSync Unified is the only one that actually works anymore. You could have broken something with AppSync 7.0+. It's quite likely you might have to just restore and lose your jailbreak.
