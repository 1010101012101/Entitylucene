How to hit "right-control" in VirtualBox on a remote Linux system over RDP via CoRD? <body> I'm connecting using CoRD to a remote Linux system running xrdp.  On that Linux system, I'm running VirtualBox.  To escape from Virtualbox, I need to hit a "right control" key.  Trouble is... I don't know how.  Anyone have experience with this kind of arrangement?  Suggestions?  <answer59527> I was able to reprogram the VirtualBox Host Key.  It seems to think my right-command key is a left alt, but the end result is the same, it works now.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5FhYW.png" alt="Virutalbox Host Key"  <comment68585> how is this Apple related? <comment68598> CoRD is a MacOS Application.  Microsoft Terminal Services Client on Windows sends the ctrl without a problem.
