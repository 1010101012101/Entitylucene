Useless Eject key on Apple Wireless Keyboard <body> I have an Apple Wireless Keyboard that has an eject key on the top right. It is useless because my Retina MacBook Pro does not have a CD-ROM.   My MacBook is running OS X Mavericks and I expected eject key to do some power operations, just like the power key on the top-right of MacBook keyboard.  This key is useless now. How can I get it mapped?  <answer118044> The wireless keyboard emcan/em be used with systems that emdo/em still have an optical drive, and if you had an external USB SuperDrive for your MacBook Pro, it would function for that.  Your power operations have always been on the eject key using modifier keys; only recently was the power key introduced as part of the keyboard itself.  ul likbdcontrol/kbdkbdeject/kbd will give you a dialog box where you can choose to go to sleep, restart or shut down./li likbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdeject/kbd will go straight to sleep./li likbdcontrol/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdeject/kbd will restart./li likbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdeject/kbd will shut down./li likbdcontrol/kbdkbdshift/kbdkbdeject/kbd will sleep your display only./li /ul  <answer118141> You can use Karabiner (formerly KeyRemap4MacBook) to remap the eject key. Short presses of eject won't get registered unless you also install NoEjectDelay though.  This private.xml maps the eject key to a power button or key:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::EJECT, KeyCode::VK_IOHIDPOSTEVENT_NX_POWER_KEY&lt;/autogen&gt;  &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  This makes pressing eject open Finder:        precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;Eject to Open Finder&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;Eject to Open Finder&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__ConsumerToKey__ ConsumerKeyCode::EJECT, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/autogen&gt;  &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  <comment137974> Great answer, thanks. <comment169770> Note that this won't help you turn on your computer. <comment174053> Asking why Apple make the decisions they make is rarely a constructive question here. This could be  edited so it is about solving a problem, but as it is written, it's really just a rant. <comment174057> Definitely use the application Karabiner, as Daniel recommended. There are so many useful ways to repurpose an unused key when using that app. On my old Macbook Pro, I remapped the eject button so that it makes windows full screen. I really miss having that full screen button . . . time to remap the Launchpad key.
