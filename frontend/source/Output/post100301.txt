Once you remove an app from iOS notification center, can you add it back? <body> I exited out of my snapchat notifications in the notification center (I clicked the "x" on the right hand side) and now I can't see anything and I want to get it back.  I don't know what to do.  <answer100314> Nope you can't get it back once you dismissed the notification.   <answer146631> I did this to a couple apps, and then realised my mistake. So far, I have only been able to restore the application to the notification screen by completely removing it and all its configurations (through General  Usage  emapp name/em), but that is far from ideal.  I'm very interested in a better solution.  <comment118059> Is this about Notification Center on Mac or something on an iPod touch? Your question sounds like a Mac question (what with clicking an x), but you have it tagged ipod-touch. <comment118060> It's about an ipod touch... the "x" being the little close-out button... because there's an "x" on it <comment172741> Note that this is not about the notification itself, but about _all_ notifications of the specific app. <comment172742> Note that this does not remove the specific notification, but removes the entire app from Notification Center.
