Combine/merge two separate image files of the same thing(newspaper page) taken in half <body> Is there a way of combining two photos of the same thing taken in half?   For example, i have two images of the same newspaper page taken in two halves in order to keep the focus and quality of the text to an acceptable level. Now, how do i merge these two photos into one seamless photo?   <answer285141> There are a number of applications which will stitch images together, provided there is sufficient overlap. Calico is one I have used. Partly this depends on how the images are taken.  For simple tasks like this a manual process is probably better.  I use codeGIMP/code, importing the images into 2 layers and manually moving them until the match is "adequate".  <comment359551> Welcome to Ask Different.
