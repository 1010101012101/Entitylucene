Time Machine exclusions I can't remove <body> I have a problem in that any sparsebundle I create in my home folder tree is not getting backed up to time machine.  It is like an 'exclude by path' but I can't remove it or see where it is defined  precodeorion:~ root# whoami root orion:~ root# tmutil isexcluded /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle /Users/Administrator/atest.sparsebundle [Excluded]  /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle [Included]  /Users/Administrator/atest.sparsebundle orion:~ root# defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist ExcludeByPath (     "//Users/Shared/adi",     "/Users/Shared/adi",     "/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/PlayReady" ) /code/pre  Any ideas?  <answer151343> Have you tried removing the exclusion with the codetmutil/code command?     tmutil removeexclusion /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle   <comment178056> Yes I have tried that many times.  I think it is an exclusion with a named path somewhere because the `tmutil isexcluded` shows that any name (a file that doesn't even exist) is excluded if the name matches *.sparsebundle There is one file I have that matches that search that does get backed up, but any new ones I create don't <comment178057> Is it perhaps intentional? Is the system perhaps designed to only backup the contents of a sparsebundle when it is mounted? <comment178058> Just stumbled on this. There is another list of standard Exclusions in `/System/Library/CoreServices/backupd.bundle/Contents/Resources/StdExclusions.plist`. Mine doesn't mention sparsebundle files though. Might be worth checking that file on your machine. <comment178059> Could you try running `ls -l@ /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle` for me? <comment178067> codeorion:~ root# touch /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle  orion:~ root# ls -l@ /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle  -rw-r--r--  1 root  staff  0 18 Oct 20:54 /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle orion:~ root# xattr -l /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle  orion:~ root# rm /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle  orion:~ root# tmutil isexcluded /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle  [Excluded] /Users/andy/atest.sparsebundle orion:~ root#/code <comment178068> sorry don't know how to do the code thing.   but see if you can unwrap the lines
