Shortcut for jumping between words in Sublime Text 2 wanted <body> I want to jump between words in a text editor (e.g. Sublime Text 2). In Windows, I can use Ctrl-Left or Ctrl-Right. What is the shortcut on Mac?  <answer235030> I use Sublime Text 2 (version 2.0.2, Build 2221) under OS X 10.8.5 and I move from word to word by pressing the option key and left or right arrow key.  kbdoption/kbd+kbd←/kbd  kbdoption/kbd+kbd→/kbd  These are the OS X standard shortcuts so most apps that use the standard SDK behave similarly.   <comment287403> Works also on OS X 10.11.4 and Sublime Text 2.0.2, tested with Build 2221. <comment287404> @bmike, Thanks for making it a hyperlink not just an URL! :-)
