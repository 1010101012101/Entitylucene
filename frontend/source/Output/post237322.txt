Can't update my mail password on Macbook Air <body> I recently changed my Gmail password, and as expected, the mail app can't log in to that account anymore. It says "Login Failed" in the top right.   The problem is, I can't figure out how to update the password so it works again. When I go to "accounts" in "preferences", there's literally no password field. It lists Description, Alias, Email Address, Full Name, Incoming Mail Server, User Name, Outgoing Mail Server, TLS Certificate. That's it.  When I try to "add account" in the file menu, I type in my info and it of course says that account has already been added.   Is there any way to just wipe out the account and start over? Or is there some other way to update the password?  Edit: Added picture. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gEPwC.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer237340> You should be able to reconfigure your password by doing that through emSystem Preferences  Internet Accounts/em and select your Google account there.   If you recently changed your Google password, a Google login popup should appear.  <comment290599> Can you post a picture of what you see? [with details blanked out, of course] For me the password field is right there, unmissable, so I can't imagine what you are seeing. Post it to imgur or similar & add the link in comments & someone can inline it for you, if you're not sure how. <comment290604> Added to the post! <comment290606> ahh, IMAP I just realised doesn't have the password there, it's in 'Outgoing Mail Server, then edit the correct one from the list & Advanced tab. Mine for iCloud is empty there, so I might not be on the right lines - but worth a look <comment290812> There was no way to change my email password there, either. However, it did allow me to delete the account and start over, so I got it working that way.
