What side effects, if any, are there from issuing scutil --set HostName 'Fred'? <body> I have read that you can change all of the three "computer names" associated with a Mac using the codescutil/code utility.  The three names in question are codeComputerName/code (the "friendly" name), codeLocalHostName/code (used only by Bonjour) and codeHostName/code (which is subsequently returned by code/bin/hostname/code).  I understand that there are very few side effects from setting the first two.  Obviously if Bonjour clients are out there looking for the old codeLocalHostName/code then changing it will be a drag from their perspective, but otherwise this seems pretty side effect free.  I am no networking guru so the idea of changing what is reported by code/bin/hostname/code is a bit spooky to me.  Should I be concerned?  For more background, what is reported by code/bin/hostname/code changes, it seems, currently, with the weather.  Suppose, for example, my codeComputerName/code is codeChuggid/code (don't ask).  Suppose my codeLocalHostName/code is also codeChuggid/code.  I've found that when I connect to some wifi hotspots, codehostname/code returns codechuggid.linksys/code.  When I am connected to my workplace's VPN, codehostname/code returns things like codexyz-abc.vpnpool.yoyodyne.com/code.  So my worry stems from the fact that I'm concerned that since I didn't come up with either of these names, when I arbitrarily decide to set my codeHostName/code to codechuggid/code that this will cause all sorts of problems.  Is it "safe" to change all three Mac "computer names" to whatever I want?  <answer178018> If you haven't already set the codeHostName/code yourself using codescutil/code, code/bin/hostname/code is probably reporting the result of a reverse DNS lookup on your computer's IP address. Both the IP address and the result of the reverse DNS lookup will likely differ based on the network you're connected to, and can easily change over time on the same network, too.  codescutil --set HostName foo/code is a persistent setting, and unlike codeLocalHostName/code and codeComputerName/code, codeHostName/code cannot be set in the GUI. For that reason, some advise against setting codeHostName/code. In my opinion, as long as you don't get confused if you try to make changes through the GUI later, setting your codeHostName/code is unlikely to cause any negative side effects for you. However, if you do run into issues, it's easy to undo with codescutil --set HostName ''/code.
