iTunes App displays no content and Open iTunes U App message <body> I'm facing the problem as per subject. The iTunes app will open and instead of showing all the content I get a white page showing codeOpen iTunes U App/code and a iTunes U icon on the footer of the application. If I click on this I get a message saying codeCannot Connect to iTunes Store/code.  Surfing the web I have found various solutions which I have tried:  ol liReset Date/Time settings/li liSign out and in from iTunes /li liReboot the phone/li /ol  None of these have worked.  The phone is an iPhone 6s with iOS 10.1.1
