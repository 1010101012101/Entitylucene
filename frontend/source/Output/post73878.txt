"The iTunes library file cannot be saved. A folder was specified instead of a file." ...what? <body> I just updated to iTunes 11.  Now I get this error: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Oov4V.png" alt="The iTunes library file cannot be saved. A folder was specified instead of a file."  Huh? Some Googling turns up people with this problem in iTunes 7 &amp; 8. That was a while ago. They suggested various things, including rebuilding the library (which I am NOT going to do unless it's the only option).  However, my search prompted me to look in my iTunes folder. Yikes: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XWTjR.png" alt="iTunes folder is full of temp files!" Most of those temp files appeared on 11/18/12, so this must have been happening before today when I upgraded.  So, is there a good solution? Why might this happen? Is re-building the library the only way? I'd rather not lose my date-added and play-count data.  <answer83718> This is a possible solution that I came across and (initially) it seems to have worked for me:  Quoted from Apple Support Communities:     I assume the problem is gone now and here's what I did to get rid of it:      ul   listop iTunes/li   lialt-start iTunes, so it offers 'Create Library' and 'Choose Library'/li   lichoose 'Create Library' to create a new library (iTunes 1)/li   listop iTunes/li   lialt-start iTunes, so it offers 'Create Library' and 'Choose Library'/li   lichoose 'Choose Library' and chose my main library, which caused me so much pain /li   /ul      since then no more tmp files are left over in the iTunes folder and I hope it stays like this
