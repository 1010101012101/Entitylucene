Is there something like "Mac OS X manager" to control all Macs in one network? <body> It's needed to control from a Mac (turn off, install software, etc.), all another Macs connected to the same network (in the same classroom). Is there a software for it?  <answer233654> Apple Remote Desktop http://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/ might be what you are looking for.  <comment285654> Thanks! I'm going to prove it. After that, I vote. <comment285896> It's not free. Is there free alternatives?
