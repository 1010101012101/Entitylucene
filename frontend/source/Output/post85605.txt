How to see which CPU is on the current macine? <body> I'm looking on the Safe Cflags on the Gentoo Wiki, and I want to figure out how to see which CPU is on a specific machine.   On Gentoo I see you can get this with   precodecat /proc/cpuinfo /code/pre  but on Mac I get      No such file or directory   What is the equivalent for OS X?  <answer85608> From terminal, you'll want to start with codesystem_profiler/code  precode system_profiler SPHardwareDataType /code/pre  Also, much more data is available from codeioreg/code but you'll need to parse the output (which can arrive as XML if you prefer) to get things like actual bus and clock frequency of each core.  <answer85621> On the other hand, if you don't want processor name, speed, the number of processors, etc but you're interested in the model number, you might want to give codesysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string/code a try, eg.  precode$ sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E7600  @ 3.06GHz /code/pre  <comment98673> Nice example of sysctl! <comment98674> Thanks @bmike, and nice example of speeding up and filtering through `system_profiler`, I might add! :)
