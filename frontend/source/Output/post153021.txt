Annoying sound on bootcamp Win7 when adjusting sound on Apple Keyboard <body> I just installed Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro 15" (Mid 2012) with Bootcamp Assistand. I am very happy until now. The only thing that bothers me is that when I turn down/up the sound with the keys on the MacBook Keyboard (F11 &amp; F12 keys), it makes weird quack sounds. Is there a deactivation for that sound?  <comment180166> I found out the solution myself. You have to click on the sound symbol in the right corner, then you click on Mixer. There you have to scroll down Boot Camp Manager to Zero. Bingo, no annoying sound anymore. <comment180169> Add that as an Answer, mark it as correct, earn yourself some points ;-)
