How to trash VLC <body> When I try to trash VLC it says it can't be deleted. Does anyone know how to do this. Also I can no longer see any of my other things on finder.  <answer215872> I have no problem sending VLC.app ( the .app extension is hidden by default) to the Trash and then emptying the Trash.  Works just as intended.  You can try using AppCleaner to remove it or use the Terminal.  Open up a Terminal (/Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and type the following followed by a space:  coderm -drf/code  Then drag and drop the VLC application bundle onto the Terminal window.  The command line should look as follows:  coderm -drf /Applications/VLC.app/code  Now press Enter and the VLC application bundle should be removed.  If it persists then preface the command with codesudo/code as in the following example:  codesudo rm -drf /Applications/VLC.app/code  When you press Enter then enter your password and press Enter again.  (This is assuming your Account is an Admin Account.)  strongNote: Be extremely careful when using coderm/code as removed files/folders are permanently deleted and not placed in the Trash./strong  Additionally, using codesudo/code should be used with caution as well.  The primary thing to look for is that there are no typos in the command line and it's targeting only what is relevant as used.  <comment260810> If I click the finder again, my original finder shows up but I still can't trash the VLC. I did empty my trash can.
