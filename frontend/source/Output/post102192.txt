How can I swap the primary display automatically in a dual-monitor setup? <body> I have a MacBook Pro and two Thunderbolt displays at work. I work with the MacBook lid-closed because it's overkill and I don't have enough desk space anyway.  Every morning I show up to work and plug in a Thunderbolt cable and power cord, but my primary screen (the one in front) and secondary (one off to the side) are swapped. I have to this stupid song and dance in the Displays / Arrangement system preference and it's getting annoying:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/e6OLy.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l3mWz.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to do this automatically? With a setting? An AppleScript? Is there a reason that the screens are always flipped?  <answer102915> It should remember the external setttings.  Did you try to swap the cables behind the monitor in order to invert the connection order? Maybe could do the trick.  A very easy solution is waiting one months and upgrade to OS X Mavericks, where you will have the possibility of having the menu bar and dock on both screen  <answer103830> strongUpdate:/strong I think I got it.  There's a utility called cscreen which lets you control the display settings. Running it shows all displays:  precode$ cscreen DisplayID  Index     Depth     Width     Height  Refresh  4249fef       1        32      2560       1440     0  4248344       2        32      2560       1440     0 use -h to display all usage options /code/pre  Sure enough, you can force one of them to be primary (with menu bar):  precode$ cscreen -i 4248344 -p /code/pre  You can script setting the second screen as the primary like this:  precode$ cscreen -l | perl -lane 'print $F[0] if $F[1] == 2' | xargs -I id cscreen -i id -p /code/pre  Now, to bind to a key, I first created an AppleScript script, SwapScreen.scpt:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hhXk4.png" alt="swapscreen"  Then I used QuickSilver to bind the script to a F13:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4fkmq.png" alt="quicksilver"  Now, when I plug in my MacBook, if the screens are messed up, I simply hit F13. Sweet!  <answer110932> Been there, done that, with Mac Pro and 4 monitors. ;0  There is an odd bug/feature in OSX that makes default display settings privileged.  This behavior has not changed with 10.9 and I believe is what is causing your problem.  It is very poorly-documented and discussed on the web.    strongA permanent solution:/strong  ol liLog on as the root user (you will have to temporarily enable it). /li liSet the Display arrangement to what you want (as you show above)/li liLog back on as whatever you like/li /ol  It is somewhat non-obvious how to enable the Root User for interactive login, though not hard.  Here is the official Apple guide:  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH113311  I would disable it when done for security reasons.    <comment121235> Yes, displays have been swapped repeatedly. I have hesitation toward upgrading to a dot-zero revision of Mac OS X, though. <comment130591> BTW I also worked around this with a small app for a while... <comment133637> Any chance you could share said app, please? <comment139138> But using cscreen doesn't solve the arrangement problem for me. My 23" monitor is on the left, and my 13"MBP on the right. However, using cscreen, will reverse that, so I have to move the cursor the opposite direction to move from one display to the other. Even when switching back (ie.using cscreen to toggle) the arrangement is reversed. What's needed is a way to programmatically fix the arrangement in the same way as when you drag one to the left/right of the other. Setting the arrangement in the root user as suggested by DKMN here did not work in my case. <comment263542> Agreed, would be nice if the author (pyehouse) open sourced cscreen so others could enhance it.
