Do applications preserve xattrs when saving? <body> Do applications on Mac OS X (specifically the MS Office applications, but interested in others as well) generally preserve xattrs (Extended Attributes) on documents when saving them?  For example, if I add an xattr to a file:  precodexattr -w test "test attribute" mydocument.docx /code/pre  Then open this in MS Word, make a change, and save, is the attribute maintained? What does  precodexattr -l mydocument.docx /code/pre  print after saving?  <answer237736> Found a Mac running OS X 10.9.5. When saving through a terminal editor (vim) and GUI programs (TextEdit, MS Word), xattrs are preserved.  <comment289672> Why can't you test this yourself? <comment289818> No mac handy atm.
