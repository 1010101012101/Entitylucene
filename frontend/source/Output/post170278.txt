tmux hangs when re-attaching session after logout <body> Since Yosemite, my tmux, which I installed via MacPorts, "hangs" when I re-attach it after my user has logged out and logged in again. I.e. it cannot start new processes, like a new command line. The logs in console do not show anything.   I do not even know how I start to figure out what's happening here.  <answer170290> I think the use of code__DARWIN_VERS_1050/code in the emtmux/em Portfile may be causing this.  If you are able, try a clean compile from source (i.e. without that CPPFLAGS addition). Be sure to completely restart your emtmux/em server using your fresh-built binary (the difference happens in the daemon(3) call made when the server first starts up—so using a “clean” binary to connect to a server started with the MacPorts-built binary would not help).  hr  Tangentially, since you use emtmux/em on OS X, you might also use my emreattach-to-user-namespace/em wrapper program. It seems like the wrapper program may not actually be necessary on Yosemite for pasteboard access inside emtmux/em. If you are using the wrapper (and you do not mind testing a bit), try removing it from your configuration on your Yosemite system. I would appreciate hearing whether things (continue) to work without use of the wrapper (or whether you still lose pasteboard access at some point).  <comment200234> Great. I will try it out. I already found your wrapper program, but was unsure what I would need it for. <comment200291> @Arne: You can probably ignore the wrapper since it looks like you may not need it under Yosemite. Good luck with the cleanly built *tmux*. <comment200690> Johnson: It works. I have successfully rebuilt tmux with the augmented Portfile. I will file a ticket with MacPorts, and be happy for the time being.
