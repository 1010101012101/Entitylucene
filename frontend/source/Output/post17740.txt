How can I capture video of my iPad, while making touches visible? <body> I want to capture some video of my iPad.  Doing this via VNC on a PC seems like a good choice.  However is there a possibility to make my touches visible?  <answer20623> Display Recorder from the same author does exactly that.  Thanks to Vaccano.  <comment22671> If your iPad has been jailbreaked then the "DisplayOut" app shows touches. <comment22706> thanks for pointing me to it. Display Recorder from the same author is the answer to all of my problems.
