Installing Xcode with iOS 4.3 device simulator? <body> I installed Xcode 4.3.1 two days ago. I need to access the iOS 4.3 device simulator, but it is not available in the new Xcode. So I went to Xcode  Preferences  Download (tab) and downloaded the Xcode 4.3.1 developer library and the iOS 5.1 library, hoping I could add the 4.3 simulator.   But, this hasn't worked. So far I haven't got the 4.3 simulator installed on my Xcode. What is the solution for this?  <answer47324> The iOS Simulator app can be found here if it’s installed correctly:  precode/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app /code/pre  Or here:  precode/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications/iPhone Simulator.app /code/pre  Try a Spotlight search for “Simulator” to make sure the installation actually failed, before you try anything else.  <answer47334> In the iPhone Simulator, select required iOS version (4.3.2) from Hardware  Version menu.  <answer47373> The option to download iOS 4.3 simulator is available from within Xcode. You can find it under codePreferences &gt; Downloads/code. Just click on code"Install"/code and you might have to enter your Apple ID credentials.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cebky.png" alt="enter image description here"  If you don't see this option, you could try removing your older versions of Xcode and installing the latest one from the Appstore. My version is 4.3.2.  <comment54189> See http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/43309/4408 <comment54191> Well in mine, when i click on downloads, it doesn;t show iOS 4.3 Stimulator <comment54194> How can i navigate to the above paths. I tried spotlight but i was unable to find Simulator there <comment54201> In Hardware--Version there's only 5.1 (98176). I need 4.3 :S <comment54211> Try upgrading Xcode to 4.3.2 and check Preferences-Downloads again <comment54219> Open Terminal.app and enter `open /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications; open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications`. <comment54409> I have xcode 4.3.1.
