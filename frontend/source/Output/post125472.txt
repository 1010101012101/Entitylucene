When exporting from Keynote to Html, some animations (flip and orbital) don't work <body> I'm using Keynote 09 (version 5.1.1) and the latest Safari. Is there a way to make the "flip" and "orbital" show up in the html slides? (During the export process they were changed to "dissolve").  <answer125517> Most 'advanced' animations don't work in the exported HTML presentations from Keynote&nbsp;'09. This is a known limitation of the software and does not appear to be a bugsup1/sup since the animations are replaced with the Dissolve animation.  Keynote&nbsp;6 has much better HTML export using iCloud with support for most of the animations in the latest browsers. If you need such animations, consider updating to Keynote&nbsp;6 or use Keynote for iCloud.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UKneD.jpg" alt=""     Choose beautifully designed slide transitions ranging from smooth fades to elaborate animations so engaging you may forget youâ€™re working in your browser.   supsup1/sup I'm sure I remember reading somewhere a list of animations which weren't supported in HTML exports from Keynote&nbsp;'09, but I can't find it now./sup
