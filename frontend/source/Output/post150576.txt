Dock icon not refreshing when icns file is changed on Yosemite <body> I'm experiencing an issue where the Dock won't reload an icon I changed for one of my applications. I changed the icon by replacing the code.icns/code file within the application package. The version I replaced it with is currently still there, but even after rebooting and killing the dock process multiple times, the old icon won't budge.  Strangely enough, I managed to change the icon for another app with no issue, following the same procedure and rebooting.  Are there any new gotchas with the way this works change in Yosemite? How can this be achieved?  <answer151558> Try to delete the icon cache:  precoderm /var/folders/*/*/*/com.apple.dock.iconcache;killall Dock /code/pre  <answer151573> Although it doesn’t answer your question directly, there is a method to change the icon without modifying the codeicns/code file in the app bundle.  ol liDownload CandyBar from Panic (it’s great for managing custom icons)./li liImport the codeicns/code or any supported image formats into the sidebar./li liSelect the icon and press kbdCommand/kbd kbdI/kbd to show the information panel./li liSelect the icon in information panel and press kbdCommand/kbd kbdC/kbd — it’ll copy the icon to your clipboard./li liVisit code/Applications//code and find the app icon you want to replace. Again, press kbdCommand/kbd kbdI/kbd to show the information panel./li liSelect the icon and press kbdCommand/kbd kbdV/kbd to replace the icon./li liHold kbdCommand/kbd and select the affected icon in Dock. This’ll update the icon immediately./li /ol  This method is safer because it doesn’t modify the app bundle content which sometimes can cause codesigning issue, however, the drawback is dialog box inside the app will still use old icon. That shouldn’t be a problem if you rarely encounter the dialog box.  <comment179491> This seems to work!
