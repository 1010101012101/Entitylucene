Problem with FaceTime from iPhone to iPad <body> I have never used FaceTime, my friend just got an iPad and we were trying to make a FaceTime call.    I am on Wi-Fi and I have the iPhone.  When he calls, I guess through his iPad (which is email), I get the "I'm getting a Facetime phone call; do you accept?"  When I accept, nothing happens on my machine, and his says that his call failed.  If I press call back it makes a ringing sound, but disconnects.  How can I fix this, what is going wrong?
