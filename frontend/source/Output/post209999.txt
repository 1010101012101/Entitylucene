Wifi hangs on early 2015 MacBook Pro? <body> It happens regardless of what network I'm connected to. Every hour or so, the internet connection will just load forever. Nothing else changes as far as I can tell, the wifi menu still says "connected" and "internet reachable" but webpages will not load. Reconnecting to the network / turning wifi off and on will always fix it. Early 2015 13" MacBook Pro Retina.  <answer211709> You can try this site http://osxdaily.com/2015/10/16/fix-wi-fi-problems-mac-os-x-el-capitan/  . For me it doesn't work:(.   <comment253421> When your mac is taking forever to load pages, have you looked in the network preferences? It will give the current status of the connection. Connected or self-assigned ip or disconnected. What version of OS X are you running? <comment255576> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference. Link-only answers can become invalid if the linked page changes. <comment287658> Just to check if this is a connectivity problem or just Safari or other browser, make a ping to google.com (8.8.8.8) and register the milliseconds it takes, then, when the internet gets slow again, make another ping, register it and update the ping results to your question.
