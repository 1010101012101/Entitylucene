Mac OSX Account Lock Out & Auto Disabled <body> strongSitutation:/strong   I have an old iMac running 10.10.x and I primarily use it as an external display for a Macbook Pro. I tried to login to the account and got a message saying my password was incorrect. Checked the caps lock and hint and I was using the correct password.  I tried another account on the computer and it was incorrect password too. After a couple of attempts all accounts were disabled and I was asked to contact an admin. This is a personal computer so I guess that's me. I'm not a novice so I attempted to get to the bottom of it and seem to have some way bigger issue.  strongThe Problem:/strong  Process to reset passwords as follows. Reset password for the primary Admin account (all accounts but 2 are admin) using iCloud but then the new password was marked as incorrect. I reset computer using codecommand + R/code and it loaded Utilities and I changed password using Terminal coderesetpassword/code. I changed all accounts passwords to code1/code so that I couldn't miss type.    I reset computer and successfully logged into 2 accounts. I migrated some files and then turned off the screen. After some time, it went to the lock screen. I tried logging in with my password of code1/code and the account was automatically disabled after single attempt.   strongWhat could the problem be?/strong  emReset Password using Utilities/em:  https://www.cnet.com/how-to/reset-bypass-password-mac-macbook/  <comment330858> Try creating a brand new non-iCloud account and see if the problem persists. If so: make a backup and wipe+reinstall the machine. <comment332101> @JohnKeates thanks! I am backing up data now. It seems to have stopped disabling the accounts. But it seems so weird that its just easier to wipe and restart from scratch. I really appreciate you answering my question.
