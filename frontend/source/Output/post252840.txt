Connect to Bluetooth device via terminal <body> I am struggling to find some (elegant) way to connect my Mac to a (previously paired) Bluetooth device via terminal.  hr  There is a solution using Applescript simulating mouse clicks, but it has some major issues:   ul liBluetooth menu needs to be visible in the Menu bar/li liTerminal needs access to the Accessibility Controls/li liDoes not work reliably/li liIt is slow as hell/li liWhen you use the mouse while the script is running, it fails./li /ul  So, this is more or less a no-go..  hr  I don't need to switch Bluetooth on and off in general, I don't need any pairing mechanism, I just need some way to trigger the connection to known devices via terminal.  My use case is a Bluetooth Sound Module - for example I called it "NoiseBox". What I want is this:   precode./magic-script.sh connect NoiseBox /code/pre  or   precode./magic-script.sh disconnect NoiseBox  /code/pre  Can you help me?  PS: Is it possible to write some small Application in Swift or ObjC which does this?
