Xcode 7 develop for iOS without developer account <body> I have updated my iPod to iOS 9 and want to make my own apps for it, however, I do not want to pay for a developer account because of how much it costs. I read that in Xcode 7 that you can develop apps for iOS without a developer account, this does not seem the case for me, instead when I try and build my test application (a blank single view application) I get an error saying 'no code signing identities found' and requires me to 'join a program'.  Is there a way I can develop applications without paying for a developers account (is there a 'free' option in the program options or not? Don't want to go through the steps and find out I was charged $99!)  <answer206124> You can develop apps for your own iOS device be registering on https://developer.apple.com/resources/.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PXljT.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  Enrollment to any specific developer programs is a separate steps which you don't have to do. Happy coding.  <answer206130> You don't want to sign in on Apple's developer site unless you want to pay the $99 for a store certificate.  Instead, delete all Xcode copies you might have installed earlier - whether they are from the Mac App Store or downloaded and then install Xcode 7 from the Mac App store:  ul lihttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12/li /ul  Once it downloads, run the app and go to the settings:  ul liclick Accounts/li liclick the + in the lower left and add an Apple ID/li lienter a personal Apple ID, the one you use for the App Store is fine to reuse/li liyou're done/li /ul  When you build an app for iOS, connect the iOS device and choose that AppleID to sign the app when asked.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gWcnS.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer229692> The solution that has been marked works. But instead of re-downloading it, you can remove temporary files that Xcode creates on first start. It can be done using apps like CleanMyMac.   ol liSelect Xcode, then it will find relative files/li liselect all other than actual Xcode.app binary file/li liUninstall them/li /ol  And you are ready to go with fresh install of Xcode  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dc3hT.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer244801> please follow the below steps :-   strongRequirements:/strong You must be running iOS 9 on your  devices (iPhone or iPad), latest Xcode 7  and you’ll need a free developer account, which lets you “test on device”.  strongStep 1:/strong Launch your application which you want to run  on device.  strongStep 2:/strong Connect your iOS device via USB.  strongStep 3:/strong In the drop down device selection menu, select your device (not a simulator).  strongStep 4:/strong Wait as Xcode 7 indexes and processes symbol files. This may take a while as well, so be patient. Once complete, the status will say Ready.  strongStep 5:/strong Click the Play button (Run application). You’ll likely get an error that says “failed to code sign”. That’s okay. Click Fix Issue and click Add to log in with your developer account. Remember, you don’t need a paid developer account, but you will need a free developer account (Apple ID). If you don’t have a developer account, create one by clicking Join a Program instead.  strongStep 6:/strong Once you log in, click the Play button again to proceed with the compile. You may receive another error that says An App ID with Identifier…is not available. Please enter a different string. To fix this, click the General tab, and give the Bundle Identifier a unique name (delete the name between the two dots and add your own name. Leave the prefix and suffix as it is).  strongStep 7:/strong Click the Play button once more. The compile should complete, and you’ll see the app that you compiled appear on your iOS device’s Home screen.  strongStep 8:/strong You’ll need to enable access to the app by trusting the developer on your iOS device. This can be done by going to Settings → General → Profile and tapping on the Developer app and granting access.  strongStep 9:/strong Launch the app on your device Home screen, and iOS should allow you to use it. Happy code signing :).   strongNote:/strong you cannot test Push Notification and In-App purchase on Free Membership Account.  <comment248504> I don't think any of this is needed anymore. See my answer... <comment248517> The reasons to choose android over iOS are slowly crumbling - I would have liked to see this sooner, but it's a welcome step forward to let people run code on their devices. <comment248518> Thanks. That worked. I have another issue however. http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/206143/ios-untrusted-developer-error-when-testing-app <comment248519> @bmike It would be good to one day be able to 'sideload' applications without Xcode. <comment288668> Sorry, but this didn't work for me. I think you need to be aware of the configuration around provisioning profiles here, as I continue getting this error:  "No non–expired provisioning profiles were found."  Also, according to the documentation, a development certificate is required for a provisioning profile to be created. "For example, Xcode automatically registers your device and requests your development certificate, both of which are needed to create a team provisioning profile." <comment288678> You might have to clean out old signing identities. You can test that by making a new user account and try Xcode without the old keychain if you want to avoid cleaning certs, @AlxVallejo <comment301776> Welcome to Ask Different!

Please take a look on my Ans now am edited. :) <comment302266> Thanks.  It's ok to have links in an answer, it's just preferred to add the 'meat' of the info to the answer, too. Also, you state 'please follow the below links' but the link isn't there.  Either remove the sentence or add the link(s) to the answer. <comment306365> huge help! thanks <comment325915> I think you can only use three devices for development when you're not paying for a developer account.
