Terminal has gone weird after screen sharing <body> I used screen sharing on my Macbook Pro to remote control my friend's iMac.  Unfortunately, now my Terminal now says:  precodekellys-iphone-2:~ James$  /code/pre  Why is it now saying this all of a sudden? Where has codekellys-iphone-2/code come from? Should I be worried?  Thanks.  <answer92519> The default prompt in Mac OS X is derived from codeSystem Preferences/code - codeSharing/code - codeComputer Name/code. If that is set correctly and you still see codekellys-iphone/code in new terminal prompts, your terminal environment variable codePS1/code has been set in either code.bashrc/code, code.bash_profile/code or some other local file.  You can check which files set PS1 like so: codegrep PS1 ~/.*/code  Side note: If you see a line like this:    precode[ -z "$PS1" ] &amp;&amp; return   /code/pre  which just means "if this is not an interactive shell, disregard the rest of this file" - so that's not the droids you're looking for.  That should reveal a file that has a line akin to this:  precodeexport PS1="\u@\h\w$ " /code/pre  Or, if I'm right:  precodeexport PS1="kellys-iphone-2:\w " /code/pre  Edit that file/line to reflect what you really want.

How the hell is this even happening? <comment108519> Next to "computer name", under sys pref - sharing, is a button marked "Edit...". Click it, and verify what the local host name is. (computer name, and local host name are different settings) <comment108530> It doesn't say kellys-iphone-2... <comment108531> And my Mac seems to have fixed itself 0_o <comment108533> My Mac seems to have fixed it itself 0_o <comment108563> At work, our DHCP server will sometimes "recycle" old names for IPs.  The "kellys-iphone-2" name is 99% certainly coming from somewhere similar. <comment108936> It seemed to be fixed as soon as I left work with my Mac so you could be right
