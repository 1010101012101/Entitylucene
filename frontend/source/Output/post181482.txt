App-specific sound output devices <body> I am looking for a control / app for sound output control which has function that allows me to have selective sound output for any app that plays sound or music.  Examples:  ul liI am playing music in iTunes and I want it use my AirPort Output for the sound. The rest of sound / voice / music from my MacBook can use the internal speak or headset to play it./li liAt the same time, I can play my Spotify on my living room AirPort, my iTunes to my bedroom and watch YouTube on my MacBook./li /ul  <comment269903> Best I've ever been able to tell, the application has to request a separate audio output device.  The only app I've seen that can do it is VLC.
