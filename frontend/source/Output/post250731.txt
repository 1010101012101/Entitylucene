Preview: How to edit the color of only the selected area? <body> I have an image of a hand that I want to change the color of only the sleeve for:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0nfsl.png" alt="enter image description here"  I used the magic wand and it highlighted the area I wanted. However, when I open up the "Adjust Color" tool and slide the sliders, the adjustments affect the whole image and not just the highlighted / selected area.  I want to make changes only to the sleeve. Is this possible in preview?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yVdyO.gif" alt="enter image description here"  <comment311465> I would doubt it. that's a pretty advanced trick for what is essentially a 'viewer' only. <comment311466> @Tetsujin do you know of any alternative websites that could do this? <comment311467> Websites? No. Photoshop could do it, fairly easily - maybe Gimp [freeware] could too <comment311485> You can use Preview to crop. If you crop that selection, it should ask you if you want to convert the file to a PNG because the new background will be transparent. You could then change the coloring on the newly cropped material. Here's the catch - you would then have to figure out how to merge the original file and the cropped & edited one. Without Photoshop, I'm not sure how to do that.
