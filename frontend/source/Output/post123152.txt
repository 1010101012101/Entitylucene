AppleScript, Automator workflow, or shell script? <comment143845> This question appears to be off-topic because it is about shell scripting and not specific to Apple software or hardware. This question would be better answered on superuser or another Stack Exchange site. <comment143849> I'd say its fine here whatever script is called for. Our users might be more likely to answer with other options but we'd only migrate if the op asked.
