Get Keychain statistics <body> Is it possible to get Apple Keychain statistics as they are there for Chrome's smart lock?  I'm looking for something similar to what is available at this page (if you use Chrome): https://www.google.com/settings/chrome/sync  <answer276269> In Keychain Access (available from /Applications/Utilities/), select a keychain, choose a category and observe the number of items shown in the status bar.                      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RAfsw.png" width="448"  You can't obtain any statistics about your keychain on iOS.  <comment347641> Do you mean 'Keychain'? <comment347649> I've presumed you meant Keychain — feel free to [edit]. <comment347787> Sad that it's not working from inside ios... but thanks for the solution
