MacBook Pro 13" 2011 not booting -- question mark folder <body> My MacBook Pro is not booting. It only shows me a question mark folder. If I try to manually boot, it doesn't give me any options than to go into recovery. And if I go into recovery and then disk utility, it looks like the drive isn't even connected. Has anyone experienced this before? Could it be that the hdd cable is faulty and should be changed? I doubt this is a software problem.  <answer187963> Folder showing code?/code means, that there is no bootable system found on your hard disk.
