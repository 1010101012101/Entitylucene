How can I burn my iPhoto slideshow to DVD (to play in DVD player)? <body> I can't figure out the way to burn my iPhoto slideshow to a DVD so I can play in a DVD player.  I am pretty sure this works out of the box but after googling, I only find paid software.  I am happy to pay but just want to make sure that I am not missing some out of the box solution.  <comment111691> did you try the Share  Burn <comment111707> @Buscar - yes, i did and that doesn't create video DVDs so it doesn't solve my problem <comment123716> As you found, "out of the box" is no longer true (unless you are still keeping an old copy of iDVD).
