QuickTime browser plug-in hotkeys <body> Question is kinda nooby, but I haven't find any hotkeys for quicktime browser plugin. Space, arrows, youtube keys (J,K,L) don't work either.br Does plug-in even have them?br ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––br MacOS Sierra 10.12.4, Safari 10.1br A site I use to watch video suddenly started to use quicktime.  <comment359800> First, we need to know precisely what OS & what browser. The Quicktime plugin is barely used any more & some browsers will no longer even allow it to be added. Most sites, YouTube etc use HTML5 these days. As Quicktime for Windows has been abandoned, it's become as bad to use as Flash, security-wise. See https://support.apple.com/HT205081 <comment359802> @Tetsujin added browser and mac version. <comment359806> I'd definitely query why in this day & age they switched to a format which has a government security advisory to be removed from all Windows machines & is even disabled by default on Macs. Did you test the plugin is installed & enabled? After that, it may simply be down to the site itself to recognise the hotkeys. <comment359808> @Tetsujin HTML 5 always worked for me and I have recently reinstalled Flash. Checked a couple of websites and no quicktime appeared. So yes, it's site and I have no idea why though.
