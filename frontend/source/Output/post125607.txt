Is Mac deployment controlled like the Apple iOS Developer Program does? <body> I am beginner Apple developer.  I want to develop Mac and iOS software, but not for sale.  Only for personal use.  As I see to deploy my iOS program to my iPhone and my iPad I need to get iOS Developer Account.  Do I need a Mac Developer Account if I am not planning to deploy my software to Mac Application Store and if I am planning to use it only in my Macbook?  <answer125609> Without a Mac/iOS Developer account you won't:  ul liget access to OS X betas/li libe able to publish your apps on the Mac App Store/li libe able to code sign your OS X / iOS apps. /li /ul  Code signing is needed if you want to run apps with Gate Keeper enabled.  There is no discount if you enroll in both developer programs.   <answer125610> To develop for OSX you just need Xcode which is free from the app store.  There is also a free developers account which gives access to some more documentation - but I think that a paid for iOS account will get the same info.  As for iOS you could jailbreak you devices as an alternative to the account see   <answer125611> Apple's developer accounts have zero overlap at the moment.   If you are an iOS developer, nothing that you do on the iOS side changes if/when you subsequently enroll for Mac development.   The only foreseeable conflict is one it's unlikely to happen in practice. If you were running a beta version of Xcode for iOS and want to run a different beta version of Xcode for an unsupported beta version of Mac OS X, you might have to have two machines (or a dual boot setup) to do the beta builds simultaneously.   You should start with free: download Xcode and make an app for the shipping OS using the free SDK. You don't need to pay for a Mac developer account until you need to sign code or access pre-release SDK. Pay the money only when you hit a roadblock. Same goes for iOS, start free and only pay when you need to do something that the paid account allows.   <comment146973> Thanks. Is it possible to run my application on my macbook without code signing ? <comment146974> Yes if you disable GateKeeper. <comment146975> Can you please give more info about free developers accounts ?  As I see it is free only for universities. <comment146976> By free he means simple dev accounts without any enrolement. They give you acces to pretty much nothing special. The docs are public, the sample codes too. <comment146978> @demas I've edited out the three or so follow on questions from your main question. Why not ask a new question asking where apple provides this info or explain what part of the public explanation of the programs has you confused? <comment146979> You don't need a developer account if you don't plan on publishing your app around. You can do it freely indeed. Voted up as I don't add a fourth answer. <comment146981> Thanks.  Your last paragraph is the best advice <comment147009> You do not need to disable Gatekeeper if you want to run unsigned programs. With the default setting, you can right-click on the app and pick "Open", and that will allow you to run an unsigned program. Once you open it once in this way, you will be able to run it normally in the future. <comment147087> @demas You can sign-up at Apple's developer site without paying money; this gets you access to released-version (i.e. currently iOS 7 and OS X 10.9) SDKs and a few other things, like WWDC videos. Once you want to sign Mac code, run on an iOS device, sell in the App Stores, access betas, etc. you need to join the relevant _Developer Program_. The former is termed "registered developer" while the latter is termed "Mac/iOS Developer Program member". Each program is USD$99/year (or your local equivalent).
