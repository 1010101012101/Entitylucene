Is there a way to prevent apps from staying in Dock after quitting? <body> Certain OSX apps seem to have a tendency to stick around in the Dock, even though there's no user-facing setting to prevent this behavior. Is there a codedefaults/code command that prevents apps from enabling "Keep in Dock?"   I know about codedefaults write com.apple.dock persistent-apps -array/code (intentionally empty), but this has to be run manually, and repeatedly. Any ideas?  <answer224242> Either the app needs to be quit with kbdcommand/kbd+kbdq/kbd, or you need to just drag the icon out of the dock, and it'll be gone.  <comment271922> How do You quit an app? If it was not kept in Dock before opening, hitting âŒ˜CMD + Q to close an app should remove icon form the Dock. <comment271929> No, there is a right click, "Remove from dock" item. I'm asking for preventing this from even being kept in the dock to begin with. <comment271930> @KevinSuttle it's not supposed to be. The only way it would happen is if the app's dock icon gets moved, or you right click on it and tell it to stay there. <comment271941> Aha, the "if the app's dock icon gets moved" is the trigger. I wonder if that behavior can be prevented.
