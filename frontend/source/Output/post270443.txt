Fancy merging of PDFs <body> I have 6 PDF files being the result of splitting multiple presentations in PDFs (which had 6 slides on each page). So essentially, now I have top-left pages of all the presentations in one file, top-right in another, middle-left in a file and so on...  That's basically how every initial presentation looked like:  precodepage 1  ___________________ |  ______   ______  | | |slide1| |slide2| | | |______| |______| | |  ______   ______  | | |slide3| |slide4| | | |______| |______| | |  ______   ______  | | |slide5| |slide6| | | |______| |______| | |___________________|  page 2  ___________________ |  ______   ______  | | |slide7| |slide8| | | |______| |______| | ..................... /code/pre  strongQ: How can I merge them together to maintain the order of the initial presentations?/strong  I kind of have to do the following:  precodefor index in range(number_of_pages_in_each_pdf):    final_pdf.append(pdf1[index])    final_pdf.append(pdf2[index])    final_pdf.append(pdf3[index])    final_pdf.append(pdf4[index])    final_pdf.append(pdf5[index])    final_pdf.append(pdf6[index]) /code/pre  There is around a hundred pages in each of those six PDFs, so strongrearraging by hand is out of question/strong.  <answer271127> Eventually, I'm answering my own question, because I finally found a way and I want to leave the complete solution here, in case someone struggles with a similar problem in the future.  The solution involves an amazing program called Poppler available through Homebrew, by codebrew install poppler/code. Poppler comes with a variety of pdf management tools, like codepdfseparate/code and codepdfunite/code featured in the script.  Without further ado, here's the script that I wrote:  precode#!/bin/bash  mkdir ~/Desktop/merging  # number of pdf files containing pages nr 1/2/3/... n=6  for i in $(seq 1 $n); do     # ${i}.pdf being a file containing pages nr i     pdfseparate ~/Desktop/${i}.pdf ~/Desktop/merging/${i}_%d.pdf done  number_of_pages=$(cd ~/Desktop/merging/; ls | wc -l) number_of_pages_each=$((number_of_pages/n))  command="pdfunite"  for i in $(seq 1 ${number_of_pages_each}); do     for j in $(seq 1 $n); do         command="$command ~/Desktop/merging/${j}_${i}.pdf"     done done  command="$command ~/Desktop/output.pdf"  eval $command  # cleanup rm -rf ~/Desktop/merging /code/pre
