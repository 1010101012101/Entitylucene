Problem loading php56 instead of php5 under MacPorts <body> I am running MacOS X Mavericks, where I manually created a MAMP stack by installing codemysql5-server/code, codephp5/code, etc., under MacPorts.  I was recently forced to upgrade this configuration to codemysql56-server/code and codephp56/code (due to installing the Cherry Framework of WordPress).  I did so by following the instructions provided in the following link.  https://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/MAMP  Note that I have still kept my old MAMP configuration.  That is, I have kept codemysql5-server/code, codephp5/code, etc., under MacPorts but, instead of using the ‘old’ commands to start up the Apache2 and MySQL servers, I now use the following commands.  precodesudo port load apache2 sudo port load mysql56-server /code/pre  All was working fine with the new configuration up until last week when, after changing some of the default parameters in the code/opt/local/etc/php56/php.ini/code file, I lost connection to my database.  The parameters I changed were  precode&lt; max_time_input = 60 ; (from) &gt; max_time_input = -1  ; (to)  &lt; upload_max_filesize = 2M ; (from) &gt; upload_max_filesize = 8M ; (to) /code/pre  N.B. The default socket values for codepdo_mysql/code, codemysql/code and codemysqli/code (in the code/opt/local/etc/php56/php.ini/code file) are set to the following values respectively,  precodepdo_mysql.default_socket=/opt/local/var/run/mysql56/mysqld.sock mysql.default_socket=/opt/local/var/run/mysql56/mysqld.sock mysqli.default_socket=/opt/local/var/run/mysql56/mysqld.sock /code/pre  I solved the database connection problem by first removing the codeskip-networking/code option under code[mysqld]/code and adding the following line to code/opt/local/etc/mysql56/my.cnf/code.  precode[mysqld] &lt; skip-networking ; (removed) &gt; socket = /opt/local/var/run/mysql56/mysqld.sock ; (added) /code/pre  Also, I changed all references of codelocalhost/code to code127.0.0.1/code in my WordPress configuration files.  While this solved my database problem, I noticed that my configuration has reverted back to the ‘old’ MAMP stack (running codephp5/code instead of codephp56/code, and codemysql5-server/code instead of codemysql56-server/code).  I have confirmed this by executing the function codephpinfo()/code in a PHP script.  Note that all attempts to reconfigure my MAMP stack back to the new configuration have failed.  That is, I have tried repeating the instructions provided by the above link to no avail.  Also, when I try to manually load the Apache2 Server using the following command,  precodesudo /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start /code/pre  I receive the following errors,  precode(48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address [::]:80 (48)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80 no listening sockets available, shutting down /code/pre  Not sure if I did something to corrupt my configuration, but I do not believe a change in PHP parameters would cause such a behaviour.  Furthermore, I suspect the reason I lost connection to the database server is because codemysql/code is pointing to codemysql5-server/code (which relies on a network socket being present) instead of codemysql56-server/code.  I have confirmed this via the output that was generated by the codephpinfo()/code function noted earlier.  Any help/advice on how to fix this issue, short of re-installing MacPorts, would be appreciated.  <comment246952> Just to let you know that I have solved the problem.  The reason `phpinfo()` showed the old MAMP configuration is because (for some unknown reason) the 'old' Apache2 server was running in the background, which is probably why I could not manually start the Apache2 server by executing `sudo /opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start` at the command prompt.  This issue was resolved by stopping the Apache2 server of the 'old' MAMP configuration, then loading the Apache2 server via the Mac `port` command.
