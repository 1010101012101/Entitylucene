Why do I always have a 4 seconds audio delay in every video stream on my Apple TV 4 but Apple TV 3 works perfect? <body> When I start a video stream on my Apple TV 4 it takes always 4 seconds until the audio stream is there. So the first four seconds the video is always muted. Does not matter which video streaming app I am using. I tested Netflix, YouTube and Sport1.  Using my old Apple TV 3 every video stream works fine. Here I have tested YouTube successfully.  I am not talking about streaming from an iOS device via Airplay, I am using the installed tvOS apps.  On my Apple TV 4 I am using the latest tvOS version 10 and already tried reset it completely, without any success. I had this issue with tvOS 9, too.  Any ideas whats causing this?
