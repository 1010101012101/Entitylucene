How to transfer an App Store app after developer enrolment ended? <body> I want to transfer an app from iTunes Connect. App was previously approved for Apple and was on sale. Now my developer license has expired. And now I can not find codeTransfer App/code and even codeDelete App/code button. Is there a way to transfer an app in this case?   <answer201162> You can't do it until you renew your developer account.  But, I know a couple of cases where calling Apple and explaining the case, Apple renew the account for 10 days to let users delete apps (don't know about transferring, but you could try).  <comment242495> Thanks. I'll try contacting Apple.
