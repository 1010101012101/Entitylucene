Unable to install software using brew install <body> I am unable to install software using codebrew install/code. I have tried codebrew cleanup/code &amp; codebrew update/code, and deleting the file, but it just does not work!  This is the error message:  precode==&gt; Downloading http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/automake/automake-1.14.tar.gz ######################################################################## 100.0% Error: SHA1 mismatch Expected: 648f7a3cf8473ff6aa433c7721cab1c7fae8d06c Actual: 3432ee773dd67c6333bdeda956bd364497630fab Archive: /Library/Caches/Homebrew/automake-1.14.tar.gz (To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.) /code/pre  <answer99117> The problem is that gnu have moved the file so you do not get the source of automake when homebrew downloads it.  If you download the file codettp://ftpmirror.gnu.org/automake/automake-1.14.tar.gz/code you get  precode&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"&gt; &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;302 Found&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Found&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The document has moved &lt;a href="http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/gnu/automake/automake-1.14.tar.gz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;address&gt;Apache/2.2.16 (Debian) Server at ftpmirror.gnu.org Port 80&lt;/address&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; /code/pre  <comment116481> As you have already followed the advice in http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/77081 let's keep it separate from http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/76733/unable-to-install-softwares-using-home-brew for the moment. What else did you try to resolve it (besides cleanup/update)? <comment116498> What should the asker do to install `automake` anyway? <comment116513> @patrix Homebrew need to update their brew for automaker. You might be able to change it locally or set up a local repository but I don't know enough about home-brew <comment116596> Remove the files.  I have tried it yesterday,but the problem is still here. <comment116597> Thanks.I will try another way to get automake. <comment140150> It's been a while ... Did it work?
