Provisioning profiles invalid. Can I develop without requiring an iPhone? <body> I'm just trying to get my app distributed. I create provisioning profiles on the developer store but when I try to install them they just become invalid to Xcode.  That feels like such a dumb question to ask but I'm not figuring this out after much Googling. I have a developer account for iOS. I have my project on Xcode which can't be archived it because there are no 'registered devices' in the member center, and I don't have an iPhone to test with. I just wanted to get my app distributed.  I've tested it and I'd like to at least get other limited testers through the Apple sandbox beta program, but I can't seem to get my code signed at all.   <comment230471> How have you tested it? If no iPhone? <comment230548> The simulator only <comment230559> There are differences between the simulator and an iPhone(perhaps this is one of them) - as a buyer I expect anything I have bought to be tested on the device
