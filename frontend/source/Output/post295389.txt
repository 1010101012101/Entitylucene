How do I stop Messages from my iPhone 6s from appearing on my Mac? <body> How do I prevent messages from my iPhone 6s from appearing on my MacBook? I’ve tried everything obvious and various solution that haven’t worked.  My MacBook is running macOS Sierra.  <answer295390> On your MacBook, open strongMessages/strong, then go into the menu bar Messages → Preferences → Accounts. Select your account labeled emiMessage/em, and under strongSettings/strong, either emuncheck/em codeEnable this account/code or click codeSign Out/code. You could also uncheck your phone number and every email address under strongYou can be reached for messages at/strong.  This will stop your Mac from being able to both send and receive iMessages. If you had strongText Message Forwarding/strong enabled for your Mac, this will stop it also.  <comment372955> Tried that.  No effect and I dont know why.  All I need do is open a conversation on my iphone and my Mac notifies me and opens messages.  Any other ideas? <comment372956> @LaurenceKayson Under **You can be reached for messages at** have you tried unchecking your phone number and all email addresses? <comment372958> What I've now done is to sign out from icloud on my iphone in settings, messages, send & receive, and that seems to have stopped it.  Your suggestion led the way. <comment372959> Ha ha, but now I can't imessage from my iphone.  Giving up for a while, unless any ideas come my way <comment372962> Okay I went into settings, general, hands off and that has worked.  Doesn't seem logical for that to be in General, but maybe that will bring it's own unintended consequences!  let's see. <comment372963> This is a more general feature that allows you to continue whatever you’re doing on one device on another. **Messages** supports **Handoff**, but many other apps do a well.
