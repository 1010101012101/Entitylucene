Sending a "show next" command to multiple computers <body> I am trying to sync the advancement of Keynote slides on two matching computers. I am running into a delay on the second machine. ( I have switched the tell blocks and the second machine is always delayed) Is there a way to have applescript process two tell commands at the same time instead of one after the other. The script with the delay is as follows  using terms from application "Keynote"     tell application "Keynote" of machine remoteMac1         show next     end tell     tell application "keynote" of machine remoteMac2         show next     end tell end using terms from  Any ideas?  <comment38823> I dont know applescript very well, but could you tell them to both do it at a specific time?
