Making a program use a specific network interface <body> I would like my IRC client to only use a WiFi connection and all other programs to use WiFi or wired connections. This is because every time I plug in my Ethernet cable my IRC client automatically reconnects over wired, and then when I disconnect the cable it reconnects me on wireless.   So now I have multiple users logged into IRC.  Can I force an app to use a certain connection over the others? I like having the wired connection as the primary connection over wireless, because I do a lot of uploading and downloading and the NIC card gets hot sometimes. I guess I should of stated I'm using a MacBook Pro.   <answer59571> Add a static route for your irc server. For example I have 2 interfaces: wired (en0) and WiFi (en1) of which the wired one is the default. So if I get a route to a server, it will go through the default interface (see eminterface/em line in output) :  precodeMacMini:~ root# netstat -rn | grep -i default default            10.0.0.1           UGSc          198       10     en0 default            172.20.10.1        UGScI           0        0     en1  MacMini:~ root# route get tyr.be    route to: squarespace.com destination: squarespace.com     gateway: 10.0.0.1   interface: en0       flags: &lt;UP,GATEWAY,HOST,DONE,WASCLONED,IFSCOPE,IFREF&gt;  recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire        0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0 /code/pre  But if I add a static route through the WiFi interface en1 however :  precodeMacMini:~ root# route add 65.39.205.54/32 172.20.10.1 add net 65.39.205.54: gateway 172.20.10.1  MacMini:~ root# netstat -rn | grep -i 65.39.205.54 65.39.205.54/32    172.20.10.1        UGSc            1        0     en1  MacMini:~ root# route get tyr.be    route to: squarespace.com destination: squarespace.com   interface: en1       flags: &lt;UP,HOST,DONE,LLINFO,STATIC&gt;  recvpipe  sendpipe  ssthresh  rtt,msec    rttvar  hopcount      mtu     expire        0         0         0         0         0         0      1500         0 /code/pre  The route will disappear every time you reboot. To make it permanent you would have to create a script launched as a startup item or a custom launchd script.  <comment68591> The NIC does get hot? How did you determine (this is a problem)? Can that information be edited out or is that part of your question? <comment68610> it's not a problem. it's just the laptop get a little warm when maxing out wireless data transfer to my server for an hour or two (video editing.) that is why i use a wired connection for the transfer. but when i plug in the laptop IRC disconnects and then reconnects
