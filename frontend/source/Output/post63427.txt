In Quicksilver, for iTunes, can't make "Show playing track" enabled while keeping "Play/Pause" disabled <body> In Quicksilver, in the Catalog for the iTunes plugin, under "iTunes Controls" I want to enable "Show playing track" while disabling "Play/Pause". However, even after checking "Show playing track" and unchecking "Play/Pause", they both still appear in my catalog (even after refreshing the catalog). If I completely uncheck "iTunes Controls" then both actions are removed from the catalog.   What can I do to disable "Play/Pause" while keeping "Show playing track" enabled?
