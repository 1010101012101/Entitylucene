How can I send an iMessage from a different Apple ID than the one the device is registered to? <body> We have a family iPad that is registered to my Mom's Apple ID. I'd like to be able to use iMessage, but with emmy/em Apple ID, not her Apple ID. Is there a way to do this without deregistering the iPad?  <answer40807> iOS devices allow you to use different Apple IDs for different purposes. You can set the Apple ID to be associated with Messages in strongSettings  Messages/strong.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pl3RA.png" alt="image of settings - messages: click on receive at"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fLVd8.png" alt="image of settings - messages apple id info"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9p5QR.png" alt="image of settings - messages apple id sign out"   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oWsPt.png" alt="image of settings - messages apple id sign in"
