I want to save my photos from iPad OS9.3.2 to PC Windows <body> I am planning on giving my iPad to son.  I want to reset it for him but, first, I want to offload the photos and contacts onto my PC. I have found that if I use the iCloud, as soon as I shut iCloud off, all the photos and contacts are gone from PC. This is a pain.
