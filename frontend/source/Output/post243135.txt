How to erase DVD-RW in Disk Utility <body> I have a MacBook Pro Mid 2012 with built-in SuperDrive. MacBook Pro is running OS X 10.11. I am trying to erase a DVD-RW disc that is filled with some images. But the erase option is greyed out:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SldC9.png" alt="Greyed out erase button"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Mr7w.png" alt="Greyed out erase button 2"  Note that I do can select a disk image and press codeBurn "Disk Image.dmg" to disc/code and erase the disc and write new things to it. But creating a disk image is very slow in my case and I would just like it to simply erase my rewritable DVD disc. Is there a way to use Disk Utility or a 3rd party app to erase my disc? Thanks.  <answer243137> Go into Finder and right click on the DVD, there should be an option "Erase rewritable disk". Apparently that's how to erase disks in El Capitan.
