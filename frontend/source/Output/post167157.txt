Powerpoint can't close a file <body> Powerpoint has a file open that I simply can't close. If I try to, I get a white screen - and the Powerpoint Title Line - but I cannot switch windows to a different pptx. I've tried saving it with a different name, closing and reopening Powerpoint, etc. - but when I do re-open the application, there is the wretched file.   <answer167159> With Powerpoint quit, go tobr code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Powerpoint.savedState//codebr &amp; delete the folder &amp;/or contents.  Quick way to get there, if you're not sure…  ul liFrom Finder, hit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd for New Window/li liHit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd for Go…/li liPaste code~/Library/Saved Application State/com.microsoft.Powerpoint.savedState//code including the tilde ~/li liDelete the files you find in there, data.data, window_1.plist etc, everything, or delete the entire powerpoint.savedState folder itself./li /ul  Launch Powerpoint again.  <comment195983> Are you running Yosemite? <comment195987> you said "Word" in second line, it's typo? <comment195989> oops, yes - fixing <comment195990> I didn't have a powerpoint saved state to start with, so I used the path to word ;)
