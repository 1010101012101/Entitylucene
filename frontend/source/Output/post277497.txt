Encrypted external drive won't mount anymore <body> I have a 1 TB external drive I use for Time Machine, and as manual backup external drive. It is encrypted.  I started to convert it back to normal. I was able to mount it correctly several times while the conversion was in progress, but now it is not working anymore. Can't be mounted.  precodediskutil corestorage list  CoreStorage logical volume groups (1 found) | +-- Logical Volume Group 390B29FA-501C-4A34-BCE9-A2249F1FA2A3     =========================================================     Name:         HDEXT1TB     Status:       Online     Size:         999860912128 B (999.9 GB)     Free Space:   5943296 B (5.9 MB)     |     +-&lt; Physical Volume FB6151D3-4BEA-4C69-A744-A17B9AE18262     |   ----------------------------------------------------     |   Index:    0     |   Disk:     disk2s2     |   Status:   Online     |   Size:     999860912128 B (999.9 GB)     |     +-&gt; Logical Volume Family 21CF48F7-8D6D-4990-A2E6-C21680852F03         ----------------------------------------------------------         Encryption Type:         AES-XTS         Encryption Status:       Unlocked         Conversion Status:       Converting (backward)         Reversion State:         Decrypting         High Level Queries:      Not Fully Secure         |                        Has Visible Users         |                        Has Volume Key         |         +-&gt; Logical Volume 45E49F43-C577-415F-B606-3295EB25FAB3             ---------------------------------------------------             Disk:                  disk3             Status:                Online             Size (Total):          999502643200 B (999.5 GB)             Conversion Progress:   57%             Revertible:            No             LV Name:               HDEXT1TB             Volume Name:           HDEXT1TB             Content Hint:          Apple_HFSX   diskutil mount readOnly 45E49F43-C577-415F-B606-3295EB25FAB3 disk3 is a CoreStorage Logical Volume which failed to mount  diskutil corestorage decryptvolume 45E49F43-C577-415F-B606-3295EB25FAB3 Started CoreStorage operation on disk3 HDEXT1TB Error: -69649: This Core Storage logical volume is already decrypting /code/pre  Is there any way to mount it again? It seems to be still decrypting, do you think I can simply leave it attached to the Mac even if not mounted?  <answer277516> solution:  ps aux |grep disk3  this reported a fsck_hfs -y on disk 3, consuming either a lot of cpu as well as keeping the drive like as locked.  killed the related PID  then the disk mounted itself immediately. the conversion is still in progress, 60% now, but at least I can access files.  thanks.  <comment349257> Assuming conversion rate is 20 MB/s and making and drinking a coffee takes 5 minutes, drink another 71.6 cups. Then check back!
