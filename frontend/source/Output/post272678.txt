Safari 10.0.3 web inspector fail <body> Since web inspector was first invented if you right click an item and "inspect", the item is found in the web inspector and the CSS styles are listed. That is kind of the main point of web inspector.  Alas since upgrading to 10.0.3 this doesn't happen. Every single time the page is refreshed inspecting an element opens only the top level HTML nodes i.e it doesn't find the element and also the CSS drawer need so to be revealed.   This can't be intentional, is anyone else experiencing this?
