Printing a html file to PDF loses HTML formatting <body> I have this standalone report in html. CSS styles are all embedded within the html itself.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VCd0Z.png" alt="enter image description here"  When I tried to print to a pdf file, the pdf output becomes  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G9vkJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I basically lost all the formatting in the html. Both chrome or safari produce the same result.  How can I get a PDF that preserves the format?  <answer200863> The default setting for printing webpages is to try not printing extra images and colors to waste ink etc. Theres an option to print everything, see image below:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LL9qh.png" alt="Printer settings"  Let us know if this worked for you.
