Any key board shortcut to move application to another workspace in MacOS sierra? <body> I want my applications to be moved between workspaces with strongonly keyboard/strong in MAC OS SIERRA  Is it possible to move application to next workspace by   ul liany open source free tools ?/li liany alfred workflows?/li liusing bettertouch tool/li /ul  This is possible in ubuntu via compiz-plugins-manager software or just using awesome unity hud :) more information  As there are possible duplicates of this question mentioned below in the comment section and none of them have answers which works with only key board.  My question is whether the software utilities mentioned above alfredapp, bettertouchtool can be extended somehow to move applications between workspaces ?  <comment360181> It's unclear from your question exactly what you're trying to achieve - whether you want to move one window temporarily to another Space, whether you want that app to always open in that Space, whether you need to do this frequently & programmatically, or simply as a one-off arrangement that you will then stick to. <comment360182> Potential duplicates are therefore - https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/179376/what-is-an-efficient-way-for-developers-power-users-to-use-osx-window-manageme or https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28569/is-there-a-keyboard-shortcut-to-move-a-window-from-one-monitor-to-another?rq=1 so right now I'm voting to close as 'unclear' rather than a duplicate. <comment360185> @Tetsujin I want to move app to the another space :) I have edited the question and regarding the duplicates , I have specified what exactly I need.
