Autocorrect undo by delete <body> Is there an option in system settings that will undo the auto-corrected word by just pressing delete key? When we type fast we don't check for auto-correct pop up but we check for spelling mistake. If we find the word misspelled we are inclined to press delete key rather escape.  I recently bought mac. This auto correct feature is annoying. But I don want to disable it but want to use it effectively.  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch,Early 2015), OS X El Capitan (10.11)
