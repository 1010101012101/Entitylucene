Cannot remove iOS simulator receipt files from Trash <body> I was trying to use the iOS7 simulator in El Capitan in Xcode 6.4, deleted it, reinstalled it etc. Part of that was dragging codeiOS 7.1.simruntime/code from code/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/code to Trash. Now I want to empty the Trash and it does not work.  ol liOpen Trash, click "Empty": "The operation can’t be completed because the item “iOS 7.1.simruntime” is in use"/li liTerminal: /li /ol  pre mba7:.Trash fsc$ rm -rf iOS\ 7.1.simruntime rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.iPhoneSimulatorSDK7_1.bom: Operation not permitted rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime/System/Library/Receipts/com.apple.pkg.iPhoneSimulatorSDK7_1.plist: Operation not permitted rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime/System/Library/Receipts: Operation not permitted rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime/System/Library: Directory not empty rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime/System: Directory not empty rm: iOS 7.1.simruntime: Directory not empty mba7:.Trash fsc$  /pre  ol start="3" liTerminal: "sudo"/li /ol  pre mba7:.Trash fsc$ sudo rm -rf iOS\ 7.1.simruntime ... same error /pre  ol start="4" li"lsof" (output manually wrapped)/li /ol  pre mba7:.Trash fsc$ sudo lsof | grep "simruntime" com.apple 743            root  txt       REG                1,4      58608            21307311 /Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Profiles/Runtimes/ iOS 8.4.simruntime/Contents/Resources/RuntimeRoot /usr/lib/system/host/liblaunch_sim.dylib /pre  I already restarted several times, tried to change permissions etc.  What other steps can I take to get rid of the files?  <answer216245> You need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP).  ul liReboot the Mac in Recovery mode : Hold down Command + R after you hear the startup chime/li liLaunch the terminal (Utilities  Terminal)/li licsrutil disable/li liReboot/li liEmpty your trash/li liReboot again in Recovery mode/li liLaunch the terminal/li licsrutil enable/li liReboot/li /ul  <comment261237> Xcode or simulator are running when your a trying to delete ? Did you tried to " $ sudo rm -rf ~/.Trash/* " ? <comment261241> @MrMojoRisin No Xcode and no simulator is running. Yes, I tried sudo rm - same error. <comment261301> Please make sure you file a radar, capturing as much state as you can, before doing this.  This is likely a bug in SIP as you should be able to remove those receipts.
