iOS - Free consumable <body> I'm not sure how to read the terms of the developer program's marketing guidelines on in app purchase of consumable items.  Is it possible to create a codeConsumable/code item for my iOS App which is Free for user's to consume? Or does a Consumable emhave/em to have a price?  <comment361365> No that is not possible... consumable IAP must have a price... Why would you want a free consumable IAP?
