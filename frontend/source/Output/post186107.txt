Applications in ~/Applications not shown in Applications folder in dock <body> I just noticed that codebrew cask install/code symlinks to code~/Applications/code. This works fine, but the application item in my dock does not show apps from that folder. Is it supposed to work this way? I expected to have an aggregated view of code/Applications/code and code~/Applications/code in my dock.  <answer186109> Each item in the dock is a single folder.   OS X does not have merged folder views except in Finder where there are Smart folders  However you could create a smart folder in Finder of Kind is Application and drag that to the Dock  <answer186151> Another way is to force codebrew cask install/code to create the links in the root Applications directory.     ul   licode--appdir=/my/path/code changes the path where the symlinks to the applications (above) will be generated. This is commonly used to   create the links in the root Applications directory instead of the   home Applications directory by specifying code--appdir=/Applications/code.   Default is code~/Applications/code./li   /ul      To make these settings persistent, you might want to add the following   line to your code.bash_profile/code or code.zshenv/code:  precode# Specify your defaults in this environment variable export HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS="--appdir=/Applications --caskroom=/etc/Caskroom" /code/pre   Source: How to Use Homebrew-cask  <comment219643> Mh that's what I guessed. I will just symlink to /Applications then by myself.
