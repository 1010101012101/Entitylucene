OS X Server MailBox size expand <body> I'm running OS X Server app version 5.1. I have mail configured for all my users. I have a default value of 200 MB for each mail box, as the server is only 256 GB. Is there any way to change the mail box location to my attached external NAS so I can locate more then 50 GB mail space to each user.  <answer234689> You two options to change the mail box location:  ol liYou can either change the Server Data location to an external volume or a share:  Open Server.app. In the left pane choose Server - emserver_name/em - Settings - Service Data. Hit the button emChange Location/em and choose another volume. This will copy strongall/strong service data to a new location.
