OS X Yosemite Hard Disk Errors even after Repairing them <body> Basically, I do a lot of C programming (for class) so I use codegcc/code a lot on my mac. Recently since two days, whenever I ran it, the entire computer is getting frozen, and a force restart is necessary to get it working again.  So I suspected what might be the error, so I ran disk-utility and checked Yosemite partition for errors. Apparently there are a lot of errors, so I booted into single user mode, and ran the following commands.  precode$ fsck -fy $ fsck -fy $ reboot /code/pre  Upon reboot, my disk is now repaired, but the computer still froze when I ran codegcc/code So this time, I ran a permissions verification in the disk utility. It said the following.  precodeVerifying permissions for “Yosemite” Open error 22: “Invalid argument” on usr/bin/gatherheaderdoc Open error 22: “Invalid argument” on usr/bin/gcc Open error 22: “Invalid argument” on usr/bin/gcov Open error 22: “Invalid argument” on usr/bin/git /code/pre  I tried to repair the permissions, but these persist. I even tried repairing the permissions multiple times, even from codeRecoveryHD/code and also from single user mode, but these errors persist.  What do these mean? What should I do to fix it?  strongEdit:/strong  Here's the output of codels -l usr/bin/gcc/code  precodeHarshas-Mac-Pro:~ sriharshachilakapati$ ls -l /usr/bin/gcc -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  14160 Sep 27 07:36 /usr/bin/gcc Harshas-Mac-Pro:~ sriharshachilakapati$  /code/pre  strongEdit:/strong  My partition is again damaged.

Why?  <answer158535> error 22 is the EINVAL in libc error codes. Maybe your glibc is corrupted? I think you can reinstall it from Xcode based on this question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9353444/how-to-use-install-gcc-on-mac-os-x-10-8-xcode-4-4  <comment186367> Can you add the output of `ls -l /usr/bin/gcc`? <comment186372> @patrix Edited the question. <comment186379> I don't use Xcode, I use GCC through Command Line Developer tools package for Yosemite. Are you saying me to re-install them? <comment186381> Yes your method to install gcc/libc. <comment186487> That didn't help. Edited the question. <comment186496> Perhaps try manually deleting the files that got "Open Error 22" when you did a permissions repair, then reinstalling the CLI developer tools. I'd suggest checking the filesystem between the deletion and reinstalling, too. <comment186500> @andonuts I'm not sure of this, tomorrow, I'm going to take this to Apple Store. Perhaps, they may gimme a replacement atleast, I still have warranty. <comment197275> I'm experiencing the same, or a very similar issue. Would be very interested in learning what your solution was. <comment197278> @thomax I took the computer to the Apple store, and they replaced the hard disk.
