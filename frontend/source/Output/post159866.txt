Project file can't be build error you don't have permission to view it <body> Hello may be this is silly question and may be asked before it but i am not getting proper solution for this. I have downloaded one project from the internet and when i am trying to run it/build it the xcode says :  The file “PROJECT NAME” couldn’t be opened because you don’t have permission to view it..  Can anybody have idea why this is happen ? Please help me to resolve this issue  <answer160158> I have resolve the issue by following way. The project i have download from the internet don't have the executable file in info.plist which should be there and its value should be this ${EXECUTABLE_NAME}. Instead of this value it consist some different value. So i have changed it ${EXECUTABLE_NAME} this value then clean-build-run successfully.  See the below link also   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27355361/error-while-build-project-xcode-says-you-dont-have-permission#  <answer171963> That's because you may using the repository cloned from the git or svn. Try to clone another new version and run it.  <answer210532> I just had same error, I had number 2015 in executable name. When I removed it, build start working. I tried to add some digit to any part of executable name but this stops build from working. Very odd really.  EDIT:  EXECUTABLE_NAME is generated from [PRODUCT_NAME][EXECUTABLE_PREFIX][EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX]. Details here  <comment187936> Did you check the permissions on the project files and folders in Finder? <comment187938> No i didn't check the permission.... Do i have to check xcodeproj file permission? It is read and write ? What it should be? <comment187952> All files (and folders) of the project should have read/write. <comment188275> I have resolve the issue by following way.
