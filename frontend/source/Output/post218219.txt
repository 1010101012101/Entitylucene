Keyboard shortcut to mute audio in OS X El Capitan? <body> I can't find the default keybinding to mute the sound in OS X El Capitan. I just want the whole OS to be muted.  Running codeosascript -e "set Volume X"/code from the terminal is not what I want to do. Because I need to store the current volume somewhere and launch a script on a specific key. It just seems like wrong approach.  F10 and any combinations of it with Command or Control did not help.  <answer218220> Try toggling the F-key functionality in System Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard  If your generic keyboard has no Mac-compliant kbd Fn /kbd key, it may be your only solution. The hardware keys don't transmit in the same way as 'regular' keys.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hl6S.png" alt="enter image description here"  This script works for Yosemite, but not El Capitan…  precodeset myVolume to get volume settings if output muted of myVolume is false then     set volume with output muted else     set volume without output muted end if /code/pre  An additional possibility could be to switch to another Sound output, one that is currently silenced, like, for example, Digital Out.

They are meant for different situations an for different types of keyboards.  hr  Might not be necessary in your case, but just so you know. You can also make custom settings with the private.xml file. Here's more documentation on that.  hr  I personally use this setting with my keyboard (codeLogitech G710+/code)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a4mjt.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer240680>    set volume with output muted   will mute without changing volume, so unmute returns you back to the prior volume.  Search for "volume" in StandardAdditions  <comment263784> Why not just F10? <comment263785> @Arc676 as I've mentioned in my question. `F10 and combinations of it with command or control didnt help.` <comment263786> Yes but F10 _by itself_ (or depending on preferences Fn+F10) is by default the mute button. Are you having keyboard issues? <comment263794> What is your Mac model (MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac etc.) and what model is your keyboard (you don't have to answer this if you use the keyboard that is attached to a MacBook Original/Pro/Air)? I require this for clarification. <comment263795> If F10 doesn't work, does Fn-F10 instead? <comment263797> I use a generic USB keyboard on a desktop iMac <comment263798> You should include that kind of information directly in your post to avoid this kind of confusion. <comment263804> El Capitan doesn't have this checkbox. I've already looked as per http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/143609/is-cmdf10-that-mute-the-mac-a-built-in-os-x-keyboard-shortcut this question <comment263809> I just took that picture on El Capitan. Maybe it doesn't have it if your keyboard has no recognisable Fn key? I also added a script which works up to Mavericks, but not on el cap. <comment263810> Up to Yosemite, sorry. Just tested on both OSes. <comment263812> An additional solution based on something I found whilst researching this one - added to answer. <comment263815> I know G710+ has dedicated volume wheel and mute button, plus you can set the "G" keys to control those via the Logitech Gaming Software, but I sometimes try to use F10-F12 to control these things by accident, which is why I used karabiner to place them to the familiar keys. <comment296995> The title of your question is incorrect, and a key detail is missing from the problem description (comment from @Arc676). May I suggest "How to emulate F10 key on a generic keyboard?"
