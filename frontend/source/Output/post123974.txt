Why is iphoto creating un-deletable albums? <body> When I sync all my photos to my mac mini iphoto then goes and creates albums on my iPhone like: strongEvents/strong, strongLast 12 Months/strong and strongLast Import/strong among others. I do not want these albums on my iPhone at all....  How do I get rid of them  <answer123977> These 'albums' aren't real albums and can't be deleted. If you're desperate to remove them, stop syncing with iPhoto.  You can provide feedback to Apple regarding this at the following page:  ul lihttp://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html/li /ul  <answer123993> If you go to iTunes and select your device there is a tab called "Photos"  If you check and uncheck the boxes as shown: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/acDwq.png" alt="enter image description here"  ul liCheck "Sync Photos" /li liChose "Selected albums, Events..." radio button/li liUn-check "Last 12 Months" and "Last Import" and any you don't want/li liThen check any albums you do want/li /ul  You should be set.  <comment279076> Are these last inport photo album taking up storage
