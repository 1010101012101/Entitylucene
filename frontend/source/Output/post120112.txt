Need to install SL on Mavericks external drive <body> I have a 2012 iMac 21" with the latest Mavericks.  I also have a need for a bootable Snow Leopard external drive so I can run Boot Camp with XP.  I purchased a Snow Leopard Retail install disk only to find the iMac refuses to boot from it and instead I get a blue screen with Black insert showing unix style error messages.  Sorry, but unable to capture these.   I have no doubt I am missing something here, but at a loss for what it is.  <answer120114> Newer Macs can't run older OSX.   A 2012 iMac will run a Mountain Lion and upward.   <comment140101> All this just to run windows only medical info program!  Damn LifeScan... <comment140102> Why would you need Snow Leopard to run Windows ? You can do a Bootcamp partion or use a Virtual Machine. Both solution are available on Mavericks ! <comment140116> Nothing forward of SL allows for XP which is the last Windows I invested in.  I refuse to buy any more of their disks.  VirtualBox works but LifeScan software doesn't connect from within.
