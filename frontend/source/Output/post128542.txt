Mouse cursor sporadically stuttering, "IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending." revisited <body> this is a new (improved? ;)) version of this post, which never got an answer.  I've been having the same issue off and on for a while on different hardware and OSes.  First: 2008 Mac Pro Dual 2.8Ghz, Mac OS 10.7. Same problem as the post cited above:  precode4/13/14 11:44:38.000 PM kernel[0]: IOHIDSystem cursor update overdue. Resending. /code/pre  When this appears in the log, my mouse stutters and seems to skip until it settles down after a second or two. I saw a post about resetting the SMC, and that seemed to fix it (on the 2008 Mac Pro), even through an update to 10.8.5.  All was well on my old Mac Pro.  But then...  I got a brand-spanking new machine, a 2012 12-core Mac Pro 2.4 Ghz. I put the boot drive from the old machine into the new machine, and everything worked just fine. Note that these are the same boot drive bits on the same drive moved from the 2008 to the 2012 machine. After a month or so, the same cursor jitter with the above message is happening a lot on the 2012 machine. Resetting the SMC hasn't helped. Resetting the NVRAM didn't help Clearing all the system caches didn't help.  If it means anything, the mouse is a Logitech MX 1100 cordless mouse, using Steer Mouse, not the Logitech Control Center.  When this first happened on my old system, I wrote to the Steer Mouse people, but the SMC reset helped at the time, and they had no explanation.  The Apple support forums haven't been of much help. Anyone have any suggestions?  This is kind of driving me nuts, especially when trying use the mouse for any fine cursor movements.  Even writing this has become an ordeal, since when I try to select text the mouse lags then jumps ahead.  Maybe it's possessed...?   Any thoughts...?
