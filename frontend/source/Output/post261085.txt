Connect to Exchange server if iOS access is restricted <body> I am trying to access an Exchange server, but it is blocked on iOS devices. I tried using both Exchange and IMAP options. The settings are correct because I get an automated email telling me I tried using an unauthorized device when I try to connect. Everything works fine on a Mac.  Additionally, I am able to use the Newton mail app that fetches mail on the backend (so it is not being recognized as an iOS device). Unfortunately, I cannot access calendar this way. I also tried Outlook app, since it has both mail and calendar, but that one fails for both. I guess it queries the Exchange server directly.  Is there any way to get around that?  At first, I thought there might be a way to somehow sync with the Mac and use that as a sort of a proxy, but couldn't find anything about that.
