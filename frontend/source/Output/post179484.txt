iPhone 6 causes Bose Mie2i to skip tracks <body> I purchased Bose MiE2i in ear headphones today and as I am walking the track skips forward every 5-10 seconds or so. If I stand still there is no issue.  I performed a hard reset and verified I was running iOS 8.2 with no change. I duplicated at a table moving only the phone and not the cable to rule out a short (it still skipped).  I tried my wifes iPhone 6 and had the same results.  I used a regular iPod shuffle and it works fine.  I am thinking it has something to so with the step monitor in the health app but there is no way to switch it off to verify.  Any ideas?

If not, I'd seek out Bose for advice. <comment212758> It does it over the internal speaker.  Headphones are fine.  Now to assess why it's doing it over the internal speaker.
