Headphone audio with Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable <body> I'm thinking of buying a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable so I can connect my MacBook Air to my PC monitor for watching iTunes movies.  However, the monitor has no audio capabilities so I wondered if anyone could tell me if I would still be able to listen to the audio via the headphone jack on the MacBook?  <answer269017> Yes you can, by going into the system preferences - Sound. Then select the tab: Output and select your output there.  As a shortcut you can ALT-click the volume icon in your top bar to quickly switch between outputs.  <comment337914> Excellent. Thanks for the quick reply.
