How to run a command on open terminal via shortcut <body> I am developing using electron on macOS. After making changes we need to run the terminal command codenpm start/code to run the app.  I would like to create a shortcut on macOS so that it simply switches focus on the terminal and runs the command.  Currently I'm using this, but it loads a new terminal window:  precodeon run {input, parameters}      tell application "Terminal"         reopen         activate         do script "npm start"     end tell  end run /code/pre  I can't initiate a new terminal for this as the command has to be run from the current project folder to start it.  Any help in right direction would be appreciated.  <answer274991> Found the answer to this query so wanted to share.  The problem with the code in question was that it was opening the new temrinal window.   The solution was th prevent it from doing that by running the code in already open window, by mentioning the codewindow 1/code in it like this:  precodetell application "Terminal"     do script "npm start" in window 1 end tell /code/pre  We can also use codekeycode/code and codekeystroke/code technique discussed here: https://stackoverflow.com/q/1870270/953566 too, however that was too lengthy and complicated, but can be useful in someones situation.  <comment345838> This might be useful - http://stackoverflow.com/a/23975628/4381356 - 'do script' will open a new window anyway.
