Vim 7.4 hybrid line numbers not working (installed via Homebrew) <body> I recently discovered that Vim 7.4 enables a hybrid number mode, such that if you do codeset nu/code and codeset rnu/code, you'll see the absolute line number of the current line and relative line numbers everywhere else (see here and here). I set this up on a Linux machine and it works great. Unfortunately it's not working on my Mac (El Capitan). If I type code:set rnu/code I'll get relative numbers with 0 at the cursor line, and if I then type code:set nu/code it will switch to only absolute line numbers, unlike what I see on the Linux machine. I have Vim 7.4 installed via Homebrew. How do I get this to work? Do I need to reinstall with some particular setting?  <answer233984> It turns out the problem was not with Vim 7.4, Homebrew, Macs, or any combination of the 3. Just my brain. I was used to codevi/code pointing to the codevim/code that I want, but in my case codevim/code points to the Homebrewed version and codevi/code points to the version originally on my Mac, which was Vim 7.3. I usually use codevi/code and codevim/code interchangeably and that shot me in the foot here. I have codevi/code aliased to the Homebrewed Vim now and everything is dandy.  <comment285903> Strange. It works fine for me. Also using the brew-installed 7.4 version of `vim`. I didn't install `vim` in any particular way or with any particular flags. Have you tried cleaning out your plugins and `.vimrc` to see if you maybe have a conflicting setting? <comment285904> Oh. FWIW I already had `:set number` in my `.vimrc` so I was doing `:set relativenumber` -- maybe it's order-dependent? <comment285906> @Ian C. Yeah I'll try cleaning out the plugins. I don't think it's order dependent. Either order works fine on my Linux machine and I tried both ways on my Mac <comment285955> @IanC. Unfortunately, even changing the names of my .vimrc file and whole .vim folder (where all my plugins are) didn't change the behavior. Really not sure what to check from here. The output of `vim --version` is VIM - Vi IMproved 7.4 (2013 Aug 10, compiled Apr  5 2016 22:32:58) MacOS X (unix) version Included patches: 1-1707 Compiled by Homebrew ...etc etc... <comment286017> Ha. Well, thanks for putting me on to `:set relativenumber` -- that's now in my `vimrc` and I'm digging it. <comment286018> Good, I'm glad something useful came out of my blinding stupidity :)
