chown to remote folder: Operation not permitted <body> I'm making a script sync a local folder with a remote one from a NAS, the folder has been mounted into OS X with the NAS administrator name and password.  The script is:  precode#!/bin/bash  /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/rsync -rav --delete --exclude=".*" /path-to-origin/ /Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/ /code/pre  The script must be executed by a user called codeAuser/code so I call the script from the command line this way:  precodesudo -u Auser script-to-rsync.sh /code/pre  And the reply I get in Terminal is:  precodebuilding file list ... done ./ rsync: chgrp "/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/." failed: Operation not permitted (1) rsync: chgrp "/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/file.ext" failed: Operation not permitted (1) rsync: chgrp "/Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/." failed: Operation not permitted (1)  sent 311 bytes  received 62 bytes  746.00 bytes/sec total size is 53864490174  speedup is 144408820.84 rsync error: some files could not be transferred (code 23) at /BuildRoot/Library/Caches/com.apple.xbs/Sources/rsync/rsync-47/rsync/main.c(992) [sender=2.6.9] /code/pre  I'm sure it's a permissions issue, so I've tried to change the owner of the destination folder to codeAuser/code without success:  precodesudo chown fmserver /Volumes/NAS/path-to-destination/ /code/pre  And I get:  precodechown: /Volumes/ombacap/om15/copies/: Operation not permitted /code/pre  <answer258132> Many foreign file systems (such as the Windows-native ones like FAT16/FAT32 etc) do not have a concept of file ownership on the filesystem level, and so the system call to change the owner is blocked with an error message.  <comment320881> What version of macOS are you using? <comment320882> @tubedogg El Capitan <comment320923> Does your NAS offer rsync services?  An NAS has it's own operating system that shares files with other computers. You can't `chown` or `chmod` from a connected computer unless the NAS allows you to. <comment322617> Right, thanks for catching that!
