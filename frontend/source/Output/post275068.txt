Drag and drop in Pages reverts original cell to default font <body> When working with tables in Pages, as I drag and drop content from, say from cell A to cell B, the font in the now empty cell A reverts to the default font.  How do I stop this from happening? Ideally I'd like to maintain the font in the cell.  I know I could press codeOption/code while dragging to "copy" it, then delete the original cell to maintain the font, but I'm hoping for something better.
