What is a good http benchmark program for Mac OS X? <body> What is a good http benchmark program for Mac OS X?  I have Apache's 'ab' installed, but it's buggy and there doesn't seem to be a Mac OS X package for Apache as an upgrade. I don't like compiling and installing from source because it's unmanaged. I use Homebrew as well.  <answer43556> You could try Seige: http://freecode.com/projects/siege  <comment49513> This works well and is also in the Homebrew system
