Remove Quicklook Syntax Highlighting with TextMate2? <body> I recently installed TextMate2 Alpha and it comes with a Syntax Highlighting plugin for the OS X QuickLook. Can it be disabled without removing TextMate?  <answer128679> You can run  precoderm -r /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/Library/QuickLook/TextMateQL.qlgenerator /code/pre  but you'll have to do that again every time TextMate is updated.
