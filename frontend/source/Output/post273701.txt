Run a script based on sunset and sunrise info? <body> What is the best way to run an Applescript when my current location's status changes from night to day and day to night?  Thanks!  <answer273702> Never used this, but it looks like Power Manager should be able to do it. You can make sun based actions similar to automator.   It doesn't seem like it has a feature built in to figure out your location automatically though. So if you're like flying from country to another and want it to automatically figure it out, you probably can't do that.  They have a tutorial: How to Power On Your Mac at Sunrise .  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1lfTv.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer273709> First of all, to get your current location on the command line, download "LocateMe" from here. Unpack the zip file and find the executable codeLocateMe/code inside, which you can either move to e.g. code/usr/local/bin//code to make it globally accessible, or put it anywhere else.   To get your local sunrise/sunset times, you can use the free api from sunrise-sunset.org/api together with the codeLocateMe/code format option code-f/code to generate your api url:  code/path/to/LocateMe -f "http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&amp;lng={LON}"/code  which should return something like codehttp://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=52.068545&amp;lng=12.126213/code  As the sunrise-sunset api returns json data, you can use codepython/code to parse it. Simply create two small shell scripts with the following contents:  precode#!/bin/bash curl -s $(/path/to/LocateMe -f "http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&amp;lng={LON}") | python -c "import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['results']['sunrise']" /code/pre  for the sunrise and   precode#!/bin/bash curl -s $(/path/to/LocateMe -f "http://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat={LAT}&amp;lng={LON}") | python -c "import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['results']['sunset']" /code/pre  for the sunset times.  Now you can simply call them from AppleScript via:  precodeset sunrise to do shell script "/path/to/sunrise_script.sh" set sunset to do shell script "/path/to/sunset_script.sh" /code/pre  and you have the sunset time as a variable inside AppleScript, where you can use them, for example, by comparing them with code(time string of (current date))/code.  <comment344104> If you already have it, or if you don't mind installing another cmdline tool, you can use [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) instead of python: `... | jq .results.sunrise`.
