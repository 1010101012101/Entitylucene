Why is my phone treating my home network as a public hotspot? <body> When I go out to the shopping center, there are various free hotspots hosted by companies, such as MacDonalds and even the shopping center itself, and when you log in, it prompts you to accept T&amp;C(s) and other various things on a landing page.  But when I am at home and when I login (obviously with the network keycode), the same prompt comes up... It brings up the Apple test page, and when I press 'Cancel', it immediately disconnects.  I've tried resetting my Network Configuration, but nothing seems to be happening. How do I connect to my home network?br I've emalso/em tried disconnecting-and-reconnecting (obvious solution) but it does not work.  strongNote:/strong Connecting to public hotspots works fine.  strongUpdate:/strong This problem persists across all networks. (Public or not)  <comment215140> Did you try forgetting the network? <comment215194> @Tetsujin I have tried forgetting the network; also keeps repeating. <comment215326> What kind of wireless router do you have? And if it has a control interface, have you checked the settings and/or tried resetting it? <comment215336> @ajkblue, I use a [Thomson TG782T](http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/bc/hardware/?action=h_view&model_id=897).  As for control interfaces, it simply uses a simple HTTP interface at [10.0.0.138](http://bigpond.bigpond). As for resetting - Numerous times. Still no avail. <comment215337> Okay, network reset didn't do it. Did you try the general solution of "backup to iTunes, restore iOS, restore backup and try again"? I had a network issue where my phone absolutely would not connect to my home WiFi even after reset network. It took the whole cycle. <comment215338> Nope; I have nowhere to back my phone up to. <comment215406> You can use any computer that has iTunes on it for that <comment215407> @KevinGrabher I meant: I **don't** have a computer with iTunes installed. Or a computer that I can install iTunes onto.
