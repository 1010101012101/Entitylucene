Left/right arrow keys in Safari PDF viewer? <body> I'm testing out a switch from Chrome to Safari, and there's a little thing that I could do in Chrome which I can't figure out the equivalent of in Safari. When I'm reading PDFs in browser (which I do a lot of for work), in Chrome I could jump to the top of the next page by pressing the right arrow key, and to the top of the current or previous page with the left arrow key. This doesn't seem to be working in Safari's integrated PDF viewer. Is there any keyboard shortcut to do the same behavior? All I can find is space bar, but that's less than ideal because it just brings me down one view (which often isn't very useful for actually reading).
