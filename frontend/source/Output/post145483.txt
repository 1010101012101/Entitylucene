Where does homebrew download software from? <body> I love how homebrew makes my life easier! Though, I just realized that I don't really know who is "signing off" the stuff I get installed through it. So, I ask:   ul liIs there a central repo (like Linux distro PPAs)? /li liOr is it all decentralized (ie. code gets downloaded simultaneously from Github, Source Forge, etc)?/li liWhat mechanisms are in place to prevent trojan horses from being installed through brew?/li /ul  <answer145486> If you look at the details of a homebrew package (e.g. on http://braumeister.org), you'll find the address of the source code in the ruby script. So it is not stored in a centralized manner but directly on GitHub etc.
