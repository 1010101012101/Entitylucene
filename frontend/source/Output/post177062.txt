Accidentally deleted iPhoto and lost all of my photos, how can I get the photos back? <body> Not sure how I did it, but iPhoto is gone from my computer, along with all of my 800+ photos. How can I get my photos back? I reinstalled iPhoto and signed in, but it is empty.  <answer177082> Assuming you didn’t delete your iPhoto Library, but just iPhoto  ol liReinstall iPhoto from the Mac App Store [you did this, go to 2]/li listrongHold down the kbdoption/kbd key while opening iPhoto/strong to select a different default library. The current default is the empty library. We want to track down your original library. /li liClick strong“Choose library...”/strong/li liBy default, your iPhoto Library is located in code/Volumes/&lt;HDNAME&gt;/Users/&lt;USERNAME&gt;/Pictures//code. Assuming you haven’t deleted the library itself, or moved it to a different location, your original iPhoto Library emwill be/em located in your pictures folder. It will be labeled codeiPhoto Library_2.iphotolibrary/code, codeiPhoto Library.iphotolibrary~old/code or something of that nature. I don’t know what the exact name will be. You will be able to tell the new from the old simply by examining the size (800 photos will be atleast a couple GB’s). strongSelect the old library./strong /li liWhen iPhoto opens, your original library should be present and intact. If it’s not, you’ve just selected the current default library. Repeat steps 2-4 in this case. /li liOnce you have identified the correct original library - using step 5 - you can now safely delete the empty (false) iPhoto Library from your pictures folder. Your original iPhoto library is now your default. /li /ol  <comment209306> Deleting the iPhoto.app should not have removed your pictures.  They should still be in the "/Users/$USER/Pictures/iPhoto Library" bundle. <comment209309> If you are able to find your old iPhoto Library bundle using the finder, then restoring that is very easy. I suggest performing a search for "iPhoto Library". You should see two results. The larger will likely have all of your photos b
