TextEdit does not show recent documents in Yosemite <body> I am new to Mac OS X Yosemite. How do I make TextEdit show recent documents? When I go to File and select Recent Documents, it does not show the last few documents like it used to.  <answer175543> You probably have the Recent items setting in System Preferences  General set to None:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxaFx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment207060> 1 up for a simple answer <comment225297> I still have this problem with Adobe Reader application and several others. There are only a few applications that indeed show recents, like Xcode. Should this be a separate question?
