Using AppleScript to click radio buttons <body> I think this is a bug in Mac OS X: with a dual monitor setup, the Dock switches to the 2nd (not main) monitor from time to time.  To fix this issue, I open the Dock, and click both the "Left" and "Bottom" radio buttons for the "Position on Screen" item.  I need to automate this with AppleScript. I could open the Dock using this script, but I'm not sure how to click the Left and then Bottom radio button in AppleScript.  precodetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.dock"     activate end tell /code/pre  I tried to add some code in the script, but it does not work.  precodeclick radiobutton "Left" /code/pre  hr  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sXN1P.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer255693> You can click the emradio buttons/em in more then one way.  After the codetell application "System Preferences"/code emblock/em use a codetell application "System Events"/code emblock/em, e.g.:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.dock"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"    click radio button 1 of radio group 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  In this first usage, emradio button/em 1 is strongLeft/strong, emradio button/em 2 is strongBottom/strong and emradio button/em 3 is strongRight/strong.  Or:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.dock"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"    click radio button "Left" of radio group 1 of window "Dock" of process "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  In this second usage, use strongLeft/strong, strongBottom/strong or strongRight/strong directly and you can also use strongDock/strong in place of strongwindow 1/strong. (The latter of which you could do in any of these examples.)  Or:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Preferences"     set the current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.dock"     activate end tell  tell application "System Events"     click (every radio button whose value of attribute "AXTitle" is "Left") of radio group 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences" end tell /code/pre  In this third usage, use strongLeft/strong, strongBottom/strong or strongRight/strong for the value of code(every radio button whose value of attribute "AXTitle" is "?")/code where the code?/code is one of these values.  Note: These examples have been tested under OS X 10.11.6 and work as now edited. I addedbr codeof radio group 1/code between emradio button/em and emwindow/em. For use in OS X 10.8.5 remove codeof radio group 1/code from the emcode/em.  <answer266629> Rather than clicking buttons, something that is slower and more error-prone, it's better to change the settings directly using AppleScript.  To change set screen edge setting, run  precodetell application "System Events"     tell dock preferences         set properties to {screen edge:bottom}     end tell end tell /code/pre  if you want it to go on the left, just exchange 'bottom' for 'left' above.  To get all possible settings, 'get properties' instead of set.  <comment318497> I'd suggest you use the Record button in Script Editor to have it generate code for you as you click the button you want. This will do two things: first, it will generate a working script, and second, you can learn from that script. <comment318500> @tubedogg, the Record feature in the AppleScript Editor doesn't work at all in most cases and incompletely in other cases. Finder is one of the few apps it works with. Frankly, I've found it to be a useless feature. <comment318504> None of the three code works for me (Mac OS X 10.11.6). The first example: Invalid index." number -1719 from radio button 1 of window 1 of process "System Preferences". The second example: Canâ€™t get radio button \"Left\" of window \"Dock\" of process \"System Preferences\"." number -1728 from radio button "Left" of window "Dock" of process "System Preferences". The last example: missing value. <comment318515> @prosseek, These all work for me in OS X 10.8.5, which it want I'm using at the moment. I'll spin up an OS X 10.11.6 after lunch and see what's changed. <comment318518> @prosseek, I've updated my answer to work with OS X 10.11.6, as explained in the "Note:" at the bottom of my answer. <comment318519> I just tested these under macOS sierra 10.12 and they work as written.
