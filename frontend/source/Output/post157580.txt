Mastering Categories in Numbers <body> I have a budget with a Column for "Categories" and for "Amount". Within the Column for categories, as one might expect, is a category for "Groceries". Groceries is column "C" and Amount is column D.    In a separate column I typed the following formula: =SUMIF(Category); "=Groceries); Amount  Where have I gone wrong?  <answer157582> What exactly are you trying to accomplish? Are you testing for the presence of the codeGroceries/code category label before adding the amount into your calculation? Are codeCategory/code and codeAmount/code named collections/ranges?  The format for codeSUMIF/code is:  precodeSUMIF(collection_to_test, "test condition", optional_collection_of_values_to_sum) /code/pre  So assuming codeCategory/code and codeAmount/code are named ranges, your formula should be:  precode=SUMIF(Category, "=Groceries", Amount) /code/pre  If they are not named ranges, it would look like this:  precode=SUMIF(C2:C10, "=Groceries", D2:D10) /code/pre  Naturally, substitute your own particular cell ranges for the first and last parameters.
