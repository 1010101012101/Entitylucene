iphone not recognized by USB (and itunes) by macbook pro <body> From following the steps in the official apple support page, it seems my computer is not able to recognize my iphone.   Other similar questions show an "unknown device" of some sort, which in my case isn't there. The phone is charging, so it's somehow connected and the USB port works with my mouse for example.   I've tried what's mentioned here but it didn't work.  Latest itunes version: 12.4.0.119 Latest IOS version: 9.3.2  strongEDIT/strong  After connecting an ipad, the connection worked via itunes.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F5TiK.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment295391> Have you tried: plugging a different iPhone or iPad into the MacBook? <comment295394> Just tried with an ipad. After plugging it, there are no changes in the system information <comment295396> If able, can you try using another computer <comment295397> I don't have another one here.
