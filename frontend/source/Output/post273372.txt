Automator ignores `email` <body> I am attempting to write an Automator Service to get information from Contacts.  codeGet Contact Information/code Action has options for codeHome Email/code and codeWork Email/code, but the bulk of my contacts just have an entry codeemail/code and this seems to be ignored.  Is there any way of convincing Automator to get codeemail/code?  A codevcard/code export contains entries like:-  precodeitem1.EMAIL;type=INTERNET;type=pref:******e@hotmail.com item1.X-ABLabel:email /code/pre  The original contacts would have been imported into Contacts (or its predecessor) 5 years ago from Windows or Palm export.
