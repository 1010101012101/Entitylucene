Photostream screensaver on apple tv3 and ios 10.x? <body> I have always had whatever photos I take with my iphone, automagically in my photostream, and those then making up the screensaver of my apple tv 3. I guess with whatever is different with apple photos/photostream now, this connection doesn't work any longer.  Any suggestions?  The iphone and apple tv are signed in to the same icloud account.  <answer267848> So, at some point, codeSettings/code-codeiCloud/code-codeiCloud Photos Settings/code got a new option: codeiCloud Photo Sharing/code. I'm pretty sure enabling this is what allowed me to select my photos as before.
