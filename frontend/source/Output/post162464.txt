Time Machine progress from the command line <body> The emTime Machine/em control panel gives information on in-progress backups. For example  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UMmBE.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to get the information from the command line?  <answer162515> While the backup is running, detailed information gan be gained by   precodetmutil status /code/pre  which should return something like this:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeBackup session status: {     BackupPhase = Copying;     ClientID = "com.apple.backupd";     DateOfStateChange = "2014-12-18 14:14:21 +0000";     DestinationID = "B4AF88-5AD5-49BE-B254-650B44E20499";     DestinationMountPoint = "/Volumes/TimeMachine";     Percent = "0.852581430477103";     Progress =     {         TimeRemaining = 0;         "_raw_totalBytes" = 38596759;         bytes = 36563200;         files = 480;         totalBytes = 42456434;         totalFiles = 480;     };     Running = 1;     Stopping = 0;     "_raw_Percent" = "0.9473127005301144"; } /code/pre  If you only care for the percentage, try the following (looks ugly, works only if there is a percentage to display):  precodetmutil status | awk '/_raw_Percent/ {print $3}' | grep -o '[0-9].[0-9]\+' | awk '{print $1*100}' /code/pre  <comment330792> I couldn't find this in the manpage. Where did you glean this verb for `tmutil`? <comment330996> @jsejcksn To be honest, I don't remember where I found out about `status`, running `tmutil help status` now returns `*** status is a private verb. ***`; why this is the case and especially *if* this was the case two years ago, I don't know :D
