How do I know if my mac's Terminal has been hacked? <body> I was using Terminal just now and realized that I was seeing something different on the screen than I have in the past. I can't remember what it used to be, but I know for a FACT that I have never seen "integrativeasheville:~" in Terminal. What is going on?  precodeLast login: Thu Aug  7 23:25:09 on ttys000 integrativeasheville:~ pbishop$ pwd /Users/pbishop integrativeasheville:~ pbishop$ whoami pbishop integrativeasheville:~ pbishop$ hostname integrativeasheville.us8.list /code/pre  <answer141319> This:  precode integrativeasheville:~ /code/pre  is called the shell prompt. It's presented to you when you open a shell in a Terminal window and it can be customized. Some people like their prompts to show lots of information like the hostname their currently logged in to, the user they're running as, the current directory they're, etc. For example, I like:  precode/Users/ian/code/packer-config |ruby-2.1.1@vanilla| [git::master] &gt; /code/pre  That's a two-line prompt that shows me the directory, the version of Ruby loaded by RVM and the gem bundle as well as the git branch I'm working on and the clean/dirty state of the local repository.  The prompt is completely customizable via codePS1/code environment variable in codebash/code (the default shell in OS X). Out of the box, OS X has codePS1/code set to:  precodePS1="\h:\W \u\$" /code/pre  This says: "display the host name, followed by a colon, then the current working directory followed by a space and then the name of the user and the default prompt character."  For a standard user this evaluates to something like:  precode&gt; bash bash-3.2$ PS1="\h:\W \u\$" ianchesalsimac:~ ian$ /code/pre  As you can see, my prompt looks an awful lot like your prompt when I use codebash/code (I use codezsh/code by default in my environment so I had to switch to codebash/code to show this to you).  That is to say, in a very long winded way: strongyour prompt looks exactly like the default OS X codebash/code prompt. Nothing odd about it all./strong  The codeintegrativeasheville/code part is your machine's host name. the code:/code is just a separator. And the code~/code means you're in your home directory -- code~/code is shorthand for "my home directory" in shell path language.  <comment292562> `integrativeasheville` is simply the hostname of your machine. It can be changed in System Preferences  Sharing.
