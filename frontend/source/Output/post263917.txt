What and how beacon (from WAP) attributes are involved in association process with other Wireless Access Point (WAP) on Apple Devices? <body> Some story: I have a MacBook, which keeps on jumping around two Wireless Access Points (WAP). I am guessing my MacBook is at coverage overlap point. So to decide which WAP to associate with, I know MacBook does checks with certain beacon (from WAP) attributes like RSSI, Noise, SNR etc.  My Questions:  ol liWhat are those beacon attributes considered while making decision to connect to other WAP?/li liHow these attributes are considered? I assume this thing is vendor specific. so in this case Apple. I observed that MacBooks are being sticky clients, does not associate to better signal until it reaches -80 or below RSSI. I am expecting answers something like this if possible: if RSSI -65 and Noise is some_value then associates to other WAP/li /ol
