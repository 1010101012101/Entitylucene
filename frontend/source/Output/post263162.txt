Is it possible to change display resolution with a keyboard shortcut? <body> I use different screen resolutions based on the activity I'm doing during the day.br For example when I'm coding I prefer to have more space available.br Is it possible to associate a keyboard shortcut to change the scaled display resolution ? br (see the attached screenshot) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hclKZ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer263164> You can use this app called SwitcherResX (http://www.madrau.com/srx_download/download.html) where they have option to change resolution with Keyboard shortcut or based on application you use. They have a trial to try.img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vlOz1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer263365> Yes you totally can achieve this without running additional apps.  On my system I created two different scripts.  One script for adjusting the display resolution higher and one adjusting display resolution lower. On my system I just enabled both scripts as dictation commands but if you create a new Service through Automator, you can assign keyboard shortcuts to those services..    First, here are the two scripts I started with.  strongThis one is for making the display resolution higher: if my display resolution is already at the default position/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WsWsk.png" alt="enter image description here"  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "Built-in Retina Display"     click radio button "Scaled" of radio group 1 of tab group 1     click radio button 4 of radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  strongRunning that script will result in this:/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jsuax.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongThis next script is for making the display resolution lower: if my display resolution is not set at the default setting/strong  precodetell application "System Preferences"     reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays" end tell tell application "System Events" to tell process "System Preferences" to tell window "Built-in Retina Display"     click radio button "Scaled" of radio group 1 of tab group 1     click radio button 3 of radio group 1 of group 1 of tab group 1 end tell quit application "System Preferences" /code/pre  strongOnce I made sure both scripts work correctly, I then opened up Automator and created a new service for the display resolution higher and added the appropriate script as shown in the following image.  I saved this file as rez_higher.workflow/strong   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fNqfp.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongFrom here, I opened up system preferences/keyboard/shortcuts/services. I located that new service I created and assigned it a keyboard shortcut/strong  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gmu1L.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongAfter this, just follow the same procedures to create a new workflow and service for the display resolution lower/strong  <comment329773> Thanks. I was looking for something at system level without running additional apps. But I will keep your suggestion in consideration as alternative solution! <comment329982> Thanks, this worked as I wanted. I've also found a workflow where you can toggle the resolution change in the same script [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5298775?tstart=0)
