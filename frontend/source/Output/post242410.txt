Why can't I remove Windows from my MacBook Air? <body> I try to remove windows from my Mac. When I open Boot Camp Assistant and click continue, a notification appears.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoPCw.png" alt="Bootcamp Assistant"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i58M0.png" alt="Notification"  <comment298174> Are you able to translate these messages? They very likely explain the cause and what you need to do. <comment298176> Setting the Mac into English language will help us help you. Also, do you use time machine? If you have a backup of the Mac, erase install doesn't take long at all if your partitions are such that Bootcamp assistant  won't touch them <comment298281> Answer plz. I need it now.
