Restart airport router via command line <body> Is there any way to restart an apple router via the commandline?    Problem: My airport express starts to "give out" every day or so. I usually have to unplug it for a couple of seconds and then plug it back in. By "give out" I mean it isn't connected to the network and is flashing a yellow light. So, I'm looking for an automatic way to restart the express. I've looked into codesnmp/code and it doesn't seem like there's a way to send commands, it's only for stats it seems.   To clarify:   I do not care using Command line, or any other means of remotely resetting the router.  <answer102340> It's not possible to access the Airport Express from the command line.  If you want to dig into codeSNMP/code and are comfortable with codeJava/code, you can look at the code for the latest version of the Linux version of Airport Utility on Ubuntu Launchpad.  <answer102554> If this is the current AppleTV-styled revision, it should most certainly be under warranty, and the best solution is probably replacing it, not rebooting it.  If it's the old 802.11g brick-style model, you'll want to try an earlier firmware unless you absolutely cannot live without multi-speaker AirPlay. The last firmware update for the 802.11g models has an issue with some (generally earlier) units and will crash after some time. Rolling back to firmware 6.1.1 resolves the issue.  <comment120536> I don't care what it is. I just don't want to go and unplug it every time. I'm not set on using command line. IF there's another way I'd be happy to give it a try. Also, when the router is undiscoverable on my network (like the problem mentioned) I can't restart it. I can only "forget" the router from Airport Utility. <comment120537> I wish I was comfortable with Java, but I'm not at this moment. Thanks <comment120605> I've never been able to access the apple routers via webpage. Is that possible? <comment120609> read this it might help you  http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-find-out-router-mac-address/ <comment120918> So. evidently Cory Mahler has a download where you can run ariport utility 5.6.1 without downgrading your higher version. Check it out [here](http://coreyjmahler.com/2013/03/08/airport-utility-5-6-on-os-x-v10-8-mountain-lion/). So, I'm getting logs right now via airport utility v5.6.1 and will post them later here or as another question.
