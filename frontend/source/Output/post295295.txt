Disable Left/Right Scrolling on Magic Mouse with Google Calendar <body> I am a first time Magic Mouse user.  I emlove/em the vertical scrolling on web pages.  However, on Google Calendar, scrolling left-to-right makes the calendar move forward and back between months.  I'm emconstantly/em accidentally scrolling my calendar with the Magic Mouse.   Is there I way I can tell the Magic Mouse to strongnot do/strong the left/right scroll/swipe thing, but to still do the up/down scroll/swipe thing?  One a per application basis?  Or some other solution I'm not thinking of?  This uber complaint thread makes it seem like it's not possible to disable this feature in Google Calendar (although I'm happy to be corrected there).  10.12.5, if it matters.
