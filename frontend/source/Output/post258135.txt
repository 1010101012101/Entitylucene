Access to "Documents" folder missed after update to iOS 10 (ipad mini 2 retina) <body> I used iExplorer to access "Documents" folder and everything was fine until iOS 10 update. I saw similar topic regarding iOS 8.3, but everything worked fine for me on iOS 9.3.* devices. Looks like that happens only for application with enterprise signature, for apps from Apple store I still have access (example is on the attached screenshot). Maybe anyone know how can I get "Documents" from enterprise app on iOS 10 device?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k8dMv.png" alt="?Loading instead app folders"
