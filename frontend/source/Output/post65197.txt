Download free app updates without prompting to enter Apple ID password on iOS 6 <body> I read somewhere in iOS 6 you don't need to enter your Apple ID password for downloading free apps and updates to already installed apps. However I see that I am still being prompted for my Apple ID password. Is there any solution for this? Is this expected behavior?  <answer65216> No password is required for app updates in iOS 6, but you still have to enter your password to buy apps, even free ones.  <answer81911> If you don't need an ID or password, anyone could download anything anywhere.br I would be worried if no password was required  <comment76600> I believe this only applies to updates.  Installing an app still requires you to enter your password. <comment76618> Do you have any restrictions turned on? I get prompted for my password with updates in iOS6 as well, and assumed it was because of restrictions I've enabled. <comment76682> No, I don't have any restrictions turned on. <comment104414> Yet, I still need to enter the password to update when the app was downloaded with a different Apple ID.
