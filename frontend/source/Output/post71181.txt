Where does a Fusion Drive store Time Machine local backups? Should I disable local backups? <body> Time Machine in OS X does store local backups (snapshots) on the local harddrive if you have Time Machine enabled.  Even if you backup regularly, the size of the local backups increases steadily. In a SSD-only setup I therefore disable local backups to decrease the write activity and used space of my SSD using:  precodesudo tmutil disablelocal /code/pre  strongShould I do this in a fusion drive as well?/strong
