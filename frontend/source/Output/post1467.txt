Dvorak on iPad? <body> Is there any way to enable Dvorak on iPad for apps like Pages or Notes?  <answer1477> Kind of a yes, no - the software keyboard can only ever be QWERTY, AZERTY, or QWERTZ. However a hardware keyboard hooked up via Bluetooth, or dock connector (or USB with the camera connector) can be set to use DVORAK:  ol liOpen up Settings App/li liGo to General/li liSelect International Keyboards/li liSelect your English Keyboard/li liUnder the Choose a Hardware Keyboard Layout you can select DVORAK./li /ol  <comment54341> Good luck finding a hardware Dvorak keyboard that you would want to interface to an iPad. There are no acceptable products on the market. I've searched for a long time. <comment54410> @WheatWilliams The above should allow you to use any hardware keyboard as a DVORAK keyboard. <comment54418> I am sorry, but you are completely wrong. See my answer. <comment54562> @WheatWilliams I simply meant any hardware keyboard; as in a QWERTY keyboard you found acceptable and were willing to ignore the fact that the actual lettering on the keys doesn't correspond to DVORAK. Doesn't diminish the fact that hardware DVORAK keyboards are few and far between.
