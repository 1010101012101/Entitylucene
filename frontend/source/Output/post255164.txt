Restore from Time Machine which has newer OS version <body> I'm trying to restore my MacBook Pro from a Time Machine backup which has been made on El Capitan.  After I wiped my MacBook it reinstalled the OS it came with when I bought it (Mavericks). But after I try to restore from my Time Machine backup, it won't work. After it's done it simply does not boot. What am I doing wrong?  Do I need to upgrade to El Capitan before I can restore successfully?  <comment317737> Have you tried resetting the NVRAM? https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204063 <comment317738> @NoahL I didn't, I'm trying to restore a second time now, will do after. I'm wondering if I need to upgrade to El Capitan first to make the restore work? <comment317740> unless I am mistaken, you shouldn't have to. I regularly use time machine backups to do downgrade restores (from 10.12 to 10.11.6 for example). So I'd assume you could go both ways (I am not positive that that's true). <comment317741> @NoahL good to know that it works at least downgrade wise. I need to see and wait, hopefully it works both ways. <comment317744> @NoahL http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/176990/restoring-time-machine-backup-made-on-a-previous-os-x-version damn :( <comment317745> yes you need to make the upgrade, but it should be free and easy to do. It will just take a little bit of time. <comment317746> @NoahL he's talking about the Migration Assistent though. Maybe it is different for restoring? <comment317747> maybe. But you've already spent so much time, I'd suggest updating to El Capitan or Sierra and then restoring from there
