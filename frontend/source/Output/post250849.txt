What is the equivalent of ipconfig/displaydns (and flushdns) in OS X? <body> I need to find how to display my DNS cache on the mac. I have tried  multi Google searches but failed to come up with a good solution.  The best I found was how to remove the cache with the command  codesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder/code which is great but I need to see the cache to see if the change works.  <answer250856> To see the DNS cache, you can use the following command in Terminal to dump a snapshot summary of the internal state of mDNSResponder to code/var/log/system.log/code:  precodesudo killall -INFO mDNSResponder /code/pre  Then to review, you can either use Console and filter using mDNSResponder or since Terminal is already handy just use:  precodegrep mDNSResponder /var/log/system.log /code/pre  To flush the DNS cache, use the following command:  precodesudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder /code/pre
