Why won't Special Characters display certain characters? <body> When I access Special Characters (⌘+⌥+T), many groups of characters will not display any characters. Coptic, Glagolithic, Runic, Gothic, etc. (Mostly more obscure characters) I'm running OS X Lion.  <answer22343> First, you may need to enable these groups by clicking the button in the upper left and choosing "Customize List…":  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/49h4x.png" alt=""  Then find the desired list and check the checkbox:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/u3MTT.png" alt=""  If you have done this and you see boxes instead of characters, it just means you don't have a font that supports those characters. If you download and install an appropriate font you should start seeing the characters.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3QbWv.png" alt=""  <answer22347> There are many characters for which you need to add fonts in order to display them on your Mac.  These sites will help you find any you might want:    http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/fontsbyrange.html   http://www.wazu.jp/   <comment24788> Thanks. I guess my font doesn't support them then.
