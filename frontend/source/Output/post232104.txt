Can't log in to iTunes Connect : blank square? <body> I haven't been able to connect to iTunes Connect for a few weeks... I have used Chrome on Linux and on a Mac. On Linux I see a white square on the login page after I log in, and on my mac the wheel keeps spinning for ever. Any idea?  <answer232320> Trying on Safari and a slightly bigger screen : my password expired and the blank screen was on Safari a screen asking to update the password.
