POSIX path returns strange path? <body> I was writing some AppleScript code when I came to the following result :   precodetell application "QuickTime Player" set paths to file of document of windows get paths repeat with theItem in paths     display dialog POSIX path of theItem end repeat end tell /code/pre  Basically it get the path of movies open in a QuickTimeX window.   The AppleScript path is OK : codeMacintosh HD:Users:MyUser:Downloads:aMovie#.mp4/code  But in one posix output I got :  code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Downloads/aMovie2.mp4/code  Any idea why this (and what code~/Library/Containers//code actually is ?), since the AppleScript was ok ? In the path above codeDownloads/code is a link to ~/Downloads.   Edit : code~/Library/Containers/code seems to be used for sandboxing (sandboxing on dev.apple.com).  But why do I have 2 differents POSIX path for the same AppleScript paths ?   <answer103559> The sandbox container directories contain symlinks to files the application is allowed read and write access to. For example code~/Library/Containers/com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX/Data/Downloads//code is a symlink to code~/Downloads//code.  You'll get the sandboxed directory path when you open the file and QuickTime is already open and the "normal" path when you open the file and QuickTime is not already open yet.
