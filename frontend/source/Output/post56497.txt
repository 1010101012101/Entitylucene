Mac App Store update issues after migrating to Retina MBP <body> I had a 2011 MBP and I just purchased the new RMBP. I used the startup migration assistant to port all my data, easy.  But I'm getting weird issues, when I opened programs for the first time I was prompted to put in my password.  Now, I am unable to update my apps (so far IMovie and IPhoto) through the mac app store, I get this error:img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVv1S.png" alt="enter image description here"  I only have one account and I am logged in to that account.  I've followed the instructions regarding repairing disk permissions and re-indexing spotlight found here   <answer56502> I had this same issue when moving to my new iMac.  Unfortunately, I contacted Apple Support and even they could not solve the issue.  Eventually, they just gave me promo codes to purchase and re-download (for free) the iLife suite.  I would use this Mac App Store support form to contact them.  <comment64875> Ugh... Okay, ill call them. If it works out ill accept this <comment64924> @MrJD Best of luck to you.  It took me a few days with back and forth emails to get my problem resolved, so hopefully they'll take care of your issue as well.
