How to split a movie into many movie files, split by chapters? <body> I'm trying to take a movie that I need to analyze for an essay and split it into 18 movie files, one for each chapter (as defined by pre-existing chapter markers), for ease of watching one scene at a time and then stopping to write about it. How do I accomplish this?  <answer211130> I solved this by using Handbrake.  ol liSelect the movie as the source file./li liNear the upper right of the Handbrake window, there's an option to select a range of chapters. Tell it to go from 1 to 1./li liName the destination file 1.mp4, so that it can be distinguished from the other files that are soon to be created./li liStart the encoding./li liRepeat this process for every chapter of the movie, clicking Add to Queue so that the files will be lined up to be created immediately after 1 is finished./li /ol  Sure enough, now I've got 18 movie files that together make up an entire film!  To my knowledge, no one has asked this question online before, so I figured I'd share my answer with the world. Hope it helps someone!
