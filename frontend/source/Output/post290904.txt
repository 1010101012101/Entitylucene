Apple Map Link: Zoom not working <body> I have discovered that you can open an Apple map using the following URL scheme:  precodehttp://maps.apple.com/?sll=-33.853863889,151.227555556&amp;z=5&amp;t=s /code/pre  According to the documentation, the codez=/code parameter is:     The zoom level. You can use the z parameter only when you also use the sll parameter; â€¦.   and its value is:     A floating point value between 2 and 21 that defines the area around the center point that should be displayed.   The URL works for the most part, but I cannot get the zoom factor to work with any value. I always get maximum zoom.  What do I need to get the URL to show a less zoomed map?
