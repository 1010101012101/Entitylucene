SSD formating trouble and mysterious disks <body> Two days ago suddenly Apple services started to fail on my Mavericks machine. I couldn't shut down (codelogind/code - or something like that - crashed but could not be force-quit). I shut down twice from terminal. Then I wanted to repair whatever is happening from recovery mode. I don't remember the message but the next thing I know it won't boot anymore.  Now when I use the (internet recovery/DVD) disk utility I usually can't format the SSD (Samsung Evo 840). In these cases sometimes the drive disappears from the Disk Utility (also from Terminal, there's just no /dev/disk0 anymore). Restarting helps, though. Sometimes I can format but then my Time Machine hangs at deleting the disk when restoring. I also took the SSD out and did a long (not the short one) exFAT format on a windows machine. Afterwards I could format it back in the mac to HFS+, but no luck again with the Time Machine. I tried codedd if=/dev/zero/code but still the same.  Here's what diskutil gives me right after deleting and creating a new partition with HFS+ and GUID (codedisk0/code is the SSD, I have no idea what codedisk3-12/code are but they are multiplying slowly but not consistently during my repair troubles):  precode-bash-3.2# diskutil list /dev/disk0    #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:

cables/adaptors being used? Are they all fine? http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1702474  But also, before you spend too much time having trouble with a virtually unusable SSD: Hence they have a 3 years warranty, let Samsung give you a new one.  <comment198085> They are RAM disks to save temporary data and keep OS X running. You are in recovery mode, running from a read-only disk image. Running `mount` command in recovery mode you can see it.
