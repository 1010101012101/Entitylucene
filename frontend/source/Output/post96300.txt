I.e. such that data type, special functions, header files have a different colour.  <answer96303> Run code:syntax on/code inside vim or add codesyntax on/code to your .vimrc.  <answer96327> You might want to consider iTerm 2 as well - it's a great terminal emulator and it will let you go full screen and will let you have a greater number of colors.
