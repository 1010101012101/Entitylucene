System volume not being used <body> When I have my wireless headphones plugged adjusting the volume in the volume menu tray or using the volume key has no effect on the actual volume heard in the headphone. I can however still manually adjust volume in particular apps like Spotify or YouTube.  Running OSX - 10.12.5 (Sierra)  <comment362013> Possible duplicate of https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/124476/unable-to-modify-the-volume-with-the-keyboard <comment362021> my difference is that the volume bar in my case isn't disabled and adjusting the volume shows the volume going up or down, the volume just isn't reflective of the audio being output.
