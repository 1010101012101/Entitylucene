First Gen Apple TV - would it make a good server? <body> I have a first gen ATV and I'm thinking of upgrading to the latest model - which leaves me with a first gen ATV with no purpose :)  I have no interest in XBMC or using it as a media server - I had just thought about using it as a normal server. Has anyone done this, and do they make a reasonable server machine?  Cheers  <comment144552> What sort is server exactly what can be ran on the Appletv is extremely small subset of applications
