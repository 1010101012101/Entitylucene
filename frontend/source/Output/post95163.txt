How can I recover iCloud Calendar backup to iPhone 4? <body> My calendar entries in my iPhone 4 have disappeared. I have no total backup - just calendar and contacts backup in iCloud. I only want to restore the calendar back to my iPhone 4. I already extracted the iCloud calendar backup into my PC.  Most websites only have instructions on how to restore the whole iCloud backup to the iPhone. What should I do?  <answer95529> If you previously synced your iPhone calendar with iCloud, you do not need to restore your iPhone. Just make sure you enable iCloud calendar sync by going to Settings → iCloud → Calendars → ON.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/isKEE.jpg" height="300"  Always make sure to keep a safe backup of iPhone calendars and other data too in case you need to restore it later.
