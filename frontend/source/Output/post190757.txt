What tools read SMART data and can run on USB bootable media? <body> I'm looking for a bootable tool that provide SMART values from my HDD if there is such a thing.  So far I'm only able to get into the recovery mode of my MacBook Pro and I need to confirm a malfunctioning HDD.  As far as I know I can't install any software in Recovery Mode? I have SMART utility but I can't think of any way on how to use it like this.  Any good recommendations for a USB or CD bootable solution to check my HDD SMART values?  <answer190765> The process to make your own test rig is quite easy:  ol liInstall OS X onto a USB hard drive. A partition with 20 GB should be just fine./li liUse the Startup Disk preference pane to reboot to that new OS and create an admin user./li liInstall homebrew - https://brew.sh/li liInstall smartmontools - codebrew install smartmontools/code /li liGet a USB drive or SD card if you don't want to boot from the hard drive/partition./li liThin out files if your image won't fit on the chosen media (or buy larger media)/li liUse Disk Utility to strongRestore/strong the OS from the partition to the media chosen/li /ol  Now you have a UDB/SD card that can boot your Mac and run one of the best free SMART tools.  <comment226526> OS X boots on any media and you can thin an install greatly if you use a tool to delocalize and look at folder sizes. Are you open to any tool that reads SMART data so you can cook up your own OS X minimal installation if you can't live with the ~8 GB needed for a full OS install? Sadly, my recent Mac's don't show SMART data in Disk Utility.
