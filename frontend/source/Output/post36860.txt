How do I retrieve stats about my iTunes Match account? <body> I wonder how I can get details on my iTunes Match account. Especially I am interested in how many songs were uploaded to the cloud. Even better: which songs are uploaded, wich ones were matched with iTune songs.  EDIT: I just found out that a smart playlist would help for that. But then I noticed that I really am interested in "how many songs can I still add to my iCloud until I reach the 25,000 songs limit"?  <answer37641> You could create a smartlist that only includes songs with the status Matched, Uploaded and Purchased.
