Use Shift+F12 in an application <body> I am using an application which has a shortcut that uses codeShift + F12/code. But when I do that on my mac, it goes to the dashboard. Which is very irritating. How can I quickly bypass that feature and send the shortcut to the app?  <answer132156> Go to strongSystem Preferences/strong → strongMission Control/strong and change the strongShow Dashboard/strong shortcut to something else.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A8Zaf.png" width="324"  <comment155317> have you tried holding the fn button at the same time? <comment155318> Wow, it's quite lame that you have to do that.. But thank you anyway <comment155321> Shift+F12 was probably a poor choice for the app developer to have made. What app? <comment155322> @samh Afaik, ⇧F12 is not default for showing the dashboard (I changed it for my screenshot) so it's not that bad <comment155324> On my Mac, F12 is show dashboard which means ⇧F12 will be the slowed-animation version of show dashboard. <comment155325> @samh Ah, fair enough. I presume that's on a full keyboard with no FN rather than MacBook? <comment155328> Macbook Pro with Retina Display. "F12" meaning, then, Fn + Volume Up/F12 key.
