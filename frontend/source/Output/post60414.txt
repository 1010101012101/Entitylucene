How can I make an Apple script for iCal event? <body> I'm trying to find a script to create a specefic type of event with iCal. Actions that I'm looking for in the script are:  ul liCreate an event /li liChoose a time and date/li liChoose an alarm /li liChoose a specific calendar/li /ul  And this is most important action:  ul liwhen an event is created the text of event is to be automatically pasted into the note section of event./li /ul  This may sound like a strange question but when I create an appointment in iCal I include my clients' phone number and manually paste it into the note section. This is so that when iCal syncs with my iPhone, I can: open the event hit the number in the note section and it calls without me having to punch it in.
