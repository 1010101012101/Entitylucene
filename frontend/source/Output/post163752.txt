MBP not detecting external monitor <body> I have 2 MBP. A private (late-2013) and a work (mid-2012). My private MBP can detect the external monitors instantly without any issues. My work MBP can only detect one of the monitors..  The monitors are exactly the same (Fujitsu Thor) and I use a mini-DP - DP cable.  I've tried resetting PRAM and SMC.  <answer163754> Turns out there seems to be something wrong with the cable.  I tried using the cable that I use to the monitor that was being detected and it works now... Is this a faulty cable or is the cable simply just not compatible or something?
