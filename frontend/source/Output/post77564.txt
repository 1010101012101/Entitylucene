Split an Apple-supplied Fusion Drive back into two separate volumes? <body> Is it possible to take an Apple factory-created Fusion Drive and downgrade it into two separate volumes?  I understand this would also necessitate reinstalling the OS and Recovery Partition etc.  The reason to do so is that the company-mandated Sophos SafeGuard disk encryption software won't work on a Fusion Drive (unsurprisingly), and FileVault 2 is prohibited (for now).  <answer79225> Yes, you can split up a Fusion drive:  http://www.macworld.com/article/2015664/how-to-split-up-a-fusion-drive.html  <comment91598> Had missed that article, thanks.
