How to provide a default value to the "Ask For Text" automator function? <body> I'm working on an Automator app that receives folders. So far it looks like this:  ul liSet Value of Variable (var1)/li liAsk For Text (default answer set to "00000 Sample Job Name")/li liSet Value of Variable (var2)/li liexecute bash script/li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysD4X.png" alt="Automator screengrab" Right now one issue that is bothering me is that when I run the app, the dialog that appears for "Ask for text" does not offer "00000 Sample Job Name" as the default, but rather the file path that was passed to the app and assigned to var1.  Why the heck would that be?   Automator 2.5, Mac OS X 10.10.5  <answer214967> Enable "Ignore this action's input" for the "Ask for Text" action to retain the default value you have specified.  <comment259621> I think you need to shoe us the code <comment259622> I agree with Mark - can you specify a version of OS X / Automator and show a [minimal version of your code](http://i.stack.imgur.com/vDaS9.png) to provide a clear statement of what you have coded and what the results you want are? My guess is you want "foo" to be entered if the user clicks OK and it's not being set? <comment259624> Thanks guys, I tried to address your questions in the edit. Basically just wondering why "foo" is not offered to the user at all in the dialog. I don't really intend for "foo" to carry through, I just think it's messy that they are shown var1 instead, for no reason I can discern. <comment259629> Thanks, that's obviously it, feel a little sheepish I didn't try that!
