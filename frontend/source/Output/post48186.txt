Bootcamp/Parallels - how to use the the line-out on my MacPro <body> I have a 2010 MacPro which I'm multi-booting (OS X, Win 7) using Parallels and Bootcamp depending on what I'm doing.  I can't see how to change the audio setting so that the line-out on the back of the 'Pro can be used as the default output. Do I need a new driver or something? I've tried using Windows Update but it tells me I already have the best available driver ...  <answer48187> I don't have an answer for you for Boot Camp, but for Parallels you should be able to (if you're in Coherence mode):   ol liClick on the strongParallels/strong menu (Just the Devices menu if you're not in Coherence)/li liGo to the strongDevices/strong &rarr; strongSound/strong &rarr; strongInput Device/strong menu/li liChoose Built-in Input device or Line in Input Device depending on what shows up./li /ol  Example: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDXcd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment55193> D'oh - how did I miss that?!
