How do I stop a freezing Chrome? <body> I tried Esc+Opt+Cmd, then selected Chrome and Force stop. The name of the application dissapeared from that menu, but it was still freezed. After 10 minutes I tried to reboot, but the computer were waiting for the application to close. In the end I pressed the power button for a couple of seconds to force the shutdown. Can I kill a lazy app without force-shutting down the mac?  <answer101579> In the terminal type :   precodekillall -9 Google\ Chrome /code/pre  Since Google Chrome uses multiple process it will kill all the process of the app with that command.
