Is there a key command to shift Apple Mail focus to top? <body> This one drives me crazy...  If you search in Apple Mail, you likely end up way back in time in your list of emails. When I am ready to read new email I have to scroll, scroll, scroll to the top of the list again.  There HAS to be a key command or something I am missing to instantly jump to the top of the list.  Is there?  <answer50872> You should be able to press the kbdHome/kbd key (kbdFn/kbd + kbd← left arrow key/kbd on a laptop) to go to the top.  Alternatively, if you have a multi touch trackpad, you can use BetterTouchTool to set a gesture for kbdHome/kbd and kbdEnd/kbd. I personally think this is the best way, and I set a three fingered swipe down to kbdHome/kbd and a three fingered swipe up to kbdEnd/kbd  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtSIk.jpg" alt="BTT three fingered swipe home and end"  <answer216345> On my MacBook Pro: kbdCmd/kbd-kbdOpt/kbd-kbd↑/kbd to go to top of messages list. Drove me nuts till I found it.    <answer239819> On an iOS device tapping the top of the screen where the time is displayed will scroll a window back to the top instantly. Works in Mail, Safari, Messages, Settings, Contacts- everything I tried it on except for the Readerware Books app.  <comment279647> Only Ctrl-Opt-↑ worked for me. <comment294455> What about on an iPad?
