How to clone an entire disk with Lion (+Rescue) & Bootcamp Partitions <body> I have a faulty (hardware-wise) drive in my 2011 macbook pro and will probably get a replacement drive from the vendor, but I was wondering whether there is (by now) a way (tool) to clone the disk completely, including the (main) lion-, its rescue- and finally the windows7 bootcamp partition without having to completely re-install both systems?  <answer27234> I know this is not a fully integrated solution, but you can use the tools available on Mac OS X and on the Mac OS install DVD/FlashDrive. You will have to restore both systems separately, but it will save you from having to reinstall everything in Windows and OS X.  hr  strongNote/strong: If your drive is phisically damaged you might end up with corrupted data or being unable to clone your partitions.  hr  There is a thread here explaining how you can save and restore your Bootcamp partition using only Disk utility and BootCamp: http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=997823  It goes along the lines of (parts are just copied):  ul liUse Disk Utility to backup your bootcamp partition to an external drive./li liYou can also use Disk Utility to backup your Mac OS partition if you didn't use Time Machine./li liInstall/Restore Mac OS to a new Hard Drive/li liUse Bootcamp to setup your drive for windows and to allocate the new space./li liUse Disk Utility to restore your .dmg image to the new Boot Camp partition you just created. Be sure to run IMAGES -- SCAN IMAGE FOR RESTORE in Disk Utility before restoring. You may need to unmount the Boot Camp partition in Disk Utility before it begins to restore./li liUse fdisk in Terminal to mark the Boot Camp partition active. First, enter the fdisk MBR edit mode by running the following:  $sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk0/li /ul  Ignore the error "could not open MBR file /usr/standalone/i386/boot0: No such file or directory". Then, determine which partition number to mark active by running the following (emin bold/em):  precodefdisk: 1&gt; show /code/pre  Your windows partition should be #3 labeled "Win95 FAT-32". Now, mark the partition active:  precodefdisk: 1&gt; flag 3 Partition 3 marked active. fdisk:*1&gt; write Device could not be accessed exclusively. A reboot will be needed for changes to take effect. OK? [n] y Writing MBR at offset 0. fdisk: 1&gt; exit /code/pre  Now, reboot and hold the OPTION key and Windows should be listed as a bootable option."  <comment31214> Thanks! However my Windows 7 installation is on a NTFS drive.. does this (making a .dm image) work for ntfs ones, too? <comment31243> For me, it didn't work with NTFS. Sorry.
