Character encoding in Safari Mobile <body> I've developped a website using JSF, which is accessed by Safari mobile running on Iphone 5C.br/ Most of the Iphones behave correctly, send the text encoded as it should, but on one of them, text is badly encoded.br/ Exemple: "Début" is written "DÃ©but" (it's french)br/ I suspect one of the user changed the settings on the Iphone.br/ What setting could it be, and how can you change it back ?  EDIT: The website is rendered correctly, the problem arise when the user type text in a textbox and submit it to the server.  <answer182391> You could set the header to display UTF-8. The user might have his location settings set differently.  HTML:  precode&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt; /code/pre  PHP:  precodeheader('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); /code/pre  <comment217063> I have never heard of any way for users to change encodings in iOS (unless perhaps switching the system language might do that in some cases). <comment217088> Where exactly are you seeing the Ã©?  This is just correct UTF-8 é being read as if it were iso-8859-1 or Win 1252. <comment217097> I see it that way on the website after encoding, and also in the database with a client like Toad
