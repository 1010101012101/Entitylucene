$RECYCLE.BIN Showing up on desktop <body> I just wiped my hard drive and used internet recover mode to install Mac OS 10.12 "Sierra."  As soon as I logged in, I noticed a new folder on my desktop called "$RECYCLE.BIN". This folder was not here when I was previously running Sierra (at least I do not think it was).  I am a little afraid to just delete it as I do not know what that will do.  Is it alright to delete this folder or is there another way I need to go about removing it from my desktop?  I already tried hiding hidden folders, but I am guessing this is not a hidden folder as that did not work.  <comment327704> This folder is generated from Windows. Could it be because you installed Windows on it before? <comment327705> I did have a boot camp partition but I wiped the entire drive before running internet recovery mode (windows became corrupt and I didn't really know what else to do so I just wiped everything). I do plan on installing boot camp again. What do you suggest I do? Is it safe to just delete it? <comment327706> This should be safe to delete. <comment327707> Similar question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/115414/what-is-recycle-bin-in-mac <comment327708> You do not think deleting it will have any impact on future boot camp installations? <comment327709> I saw that similar question, I just did not fully understand the answers so I figured I'd ask again and hope somebody else could chime in. <comment327710> Any idea why this still showed up when I completed erased the drive using disk utility before installing the new OS?
