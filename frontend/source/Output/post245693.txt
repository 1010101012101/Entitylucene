How to always show a Bcc field in Mail <body> I'm trying to send a message in Mail, but I don't have a Bcc field.  How can I show a Bcc field? Is there a way to set it as default, i.e. always show a Bcc field?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/00Z2K.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer245697> For the version of Mail.app included in El Capitan (checked 10.11.5), there is a very nice button dropdown close by:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2EYb.png" alt="enter image description here"  The setting is maintained across emails and restarts.  <comment302945> Beautiful, thanks.
