Is there any reason not to enable Error Correction in iTunes? <body> When importing CDs in iTunes you have the option to enable error correction. With the exception of the obvious potential for slower import speeds... is there any reason emnot/em to have this enabled?  <answer107951> The only reason why you would disable error correction is if you are looking for the strongfastest possible import/strong, have a strongvery old computer/strong, or want iTunes to use as stronglittle CPU as possible/strong.  Enabling error correction allows iTunes to read the error correction data on the disc, and use this to verify the read audio data. Disabling the error correction makes iTunes ignore this information and presume that the data that is read is correct.  Error correction data is basically a summary of the last few bytes of data on the disc. If the total size of the data matches the size reported by the error correction data then the data is approved and iTunes continues importing. If not, iTunes re-reads the area of the disc, and as a last resort 'guesses' the content of the malformed data. subMore Info./sub  This additional verification causes an increase in import time. On an older computer, this difference is pretty noticeable, however in newer computers the difference is negligible.  The only reasons why you would disable it on a newer computer is if you care about reducing CPU usage as much as possible. Error correction does use extra CPU to do the processing, and so disabling it will reduce the CPU usage of iTunes whilst importing.  <comment126615> Ok, good. So it's not like an experimental last resort which potentially could mess up imports for healthy CDs. <comment126617> @Svish Indeed - added info about how it works.
