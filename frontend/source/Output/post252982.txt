Use "Command + C" to copy local images to Photos on OS X? <body> I'd like to copy some images (e.g., located in codeDownloads//code) to Photos. So, these images can be downloaded to my iPhone via iCloud. I can make it with the following opertations: strongRight click -- Share -- Add to Photos/strong.  Is it possible to copy them to Photos just using kbdCommand/kbd+kbdC/kbd?   PS: I have checked the option 'Copy items to the Photos library' as shown below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Jt5D.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment314835> Try just dragging the image files directly into photos. It is the same as CMD+C CMD+V, it just allows you to use the GUI more effectively. Never had a problem just dragging them over.
