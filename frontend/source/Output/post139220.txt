How to cancel a season pass in itunes <body> I have moved overseas and need to change my apple ID country.  How can I cancel passes I still have open?  <answer214171> Think twice before you do this.  All your purchases, music, movies, TV shows, etc, will disappear from your purchases.  I did that when moving from the UK to Australia. Now I'm trying to go back to the UK store and its also near impossible due to another subscription.
