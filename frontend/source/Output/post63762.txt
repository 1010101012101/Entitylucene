Can't find my Automator service action in the Keyboard Shortcuts list <body> I've made a very simple Automator service (moves some selected files into a new folder). It works fine via the Services - menu.   So now I'd like to add a keyboard shortcut to launch this action from Finder, but I'm unable to. According to every person on the internet, I can go into System Preferences - Keyboard Shortcuts, select 'Services' on left panel, then scroll to bottom of right hand list and my service will be listed in the 'General' section. But it's not listed; I only see three items relating to unarchiving.  I've searched the web for people with this same issue but can't find any advice.  <answer63782> If it receives files or folders as input, it should be in the files and folders section and not the general section.  Was the service saved to ~/Library/Services/?  <comment73794> Argh! It is indeed in Files and Folders, I thought I checked the whole list earlier on -- maybe I did that before re-launching the Keyboard prefs pane. Thanks!
