How to setup a default program opening an unknown file extension? <body> I tried to open a file with an extension name of adb in Finder (to be precise, PathFinder). When I clicked the file, vi editor is activated to open the adb file. I didn't do anything with the adb file, so my guess is that vi editor changed the system setup to open it whenever unknown file format is opened.  How can I change this behavior? I want to open TextMate as a default.  <answer6388> strongFinder Directions:/strong brClick a file of that type. Press codecmd-i/code. Reveal the Open With: tab of the Get Info window that appears. Select the app you want. Click the Change All button below that menu.  Now, all files of the type you opened will open with the application you selected.  <answer6390> Check this answer which points you to RCDefaultApp so you can toy with extensions and default apps.   <comment6666> I wanted to know how to open TextMate even though I **don't** have the setup. I guess there should be some system level configuration necessary. <comment6667> What do you mean exactly when you say that you don't have the setup? <comment6668> I elaborate the question. Thanks. <comment6669> So, you should be able to use the process I described to restore TextMate as the default. You could also check in vi editor's prefs to see if it's got an option for this.
