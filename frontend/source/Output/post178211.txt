Best tools and add-ons to integrate OS X to a domain's Active Directory? <body> Someone here at the office is getting an Apple machine and I need to integrate it into Active Directory.  I need to map shared drives, apply group policies such as disabling the firewall, distribute updates thru WSUS, and install software/certificates that involve creating VPN connections.  What is a good add-on or tool to do all this simplifing my life as a Windows administrator?  <comment211068> Binding it to an Active Directory works out of the box afaik. Regarding updates etc. you'll probably have to depend on another mac to run os x server or at last apple remote desktop. <comment211226> I know binding it to Active Directory works......what worries me is shared drives, group policy, updates distribuation, and VPN certificate/configuration. <comment211234> If you're talking about software update, you won't be able to do that via windows server. <comment212448> Is there any legal free way to do it?
