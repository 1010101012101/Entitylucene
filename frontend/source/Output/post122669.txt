Connecting a 2009 Macbook to a TV with video and sound output <body> I would like to connect my late 2009 white Macbook to my TV, with support for video and sound.  I thought I could use the Mini DisplayPort for that purpose, but unfortunately, Apple's website says that:     These Apple computers supply only video signals over Mini DisplayPort:      (...)   MacBook (Late 2009)   I found this product from another question on Stack, but considering the price and the negative comments of that product, I'm wondering if there are cheaper/better solutions?  My TV is a recent Samsung TV with classic ports (USB, HDMI...).  <answer122671> The product you are considering retails for $69.99, Amazon is showing me one for $50 + shipping. This type of equipment is generally very sensitive to movement, easy to damage and easy to get annoyed with. Consider the manufacturing cost of that product, against how much you will pay. It seems the markup outweighs the value.  Have you considered Apple TV? You get a dedicated, more reliable, better device for $100, and it takes up less room than a MacBook combined with a cable adapter that looks like a homemade incendiary device.  Verdict: Buy an Apple TV.  <comment143200> Thanks for your answer. Well, I'm not particularly fond of spending $100 just to watch movies from my computer. I already do that with my external drive. I was just wondering if there was some sort of $15 cable which could just do that. <comment143204> The cheapest solution is to use external speakers, or the Macbook's speakers, in combination with a simple Mini DisplayPort cable hooked up to the tv.  A cheap $15 cable that combines DisplayPort with audio is likely to be even less reliable than the $70 cable you have identified. <comment143235> Thanks! This is indeed the cheapest solution
