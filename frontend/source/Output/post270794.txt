How to change 'date added' to 'date modified' for a bunch of mp3 files? <body> Straight to the business. Recently I bought new Mac and unfortunately I didn't correctly import my old music library to iTunes. I always sort my music by 'Date Added' in iTunes, but since I imported the library wrong the date is now the same for all 2000+ files. 'Date Modified' is pretty much correct though.  The question is: Is there a way to replace 'Date Added' with 'Date Modified'?  <comment340390> Can you not import your library again, but correctly? That'd be the best option, if possible. <comment340392> That would be the best option, but I do not have the old Mac anymore. Nor Time Machine backup.
