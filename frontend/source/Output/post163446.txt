How to install the 2014 NTP security fix on 10.6.8 Snow Leopard <body> For 10.6.8 would it work to open the 10.8 NTP update.dmg with pacifist and put in the new versions of the following 6 files?:  precode/usr/bin/sntp   /usr/bin/ntp-keygen   /usr/bin/ntpq   /usr/sbin/ntpdc   /usr/sbin/ntpdate   /usr/sbin/ntpd /code/pre  I am not sure about including the codentptrace/code file that was in the 10.8 codesbin/code directory. What does it do? Also what would the appropriate codechown/code command be to get these files properly recognized?  <answer163516>    For 10.6.8 would it work to open the 10.8 NTP update.dmg with pacifist and put in the new versions of the following 6 files?   No it would not work. You will probably get a segmentation fault due to major changes that happened between 10.6 and 10.8 (I don't think you could even make 10.8 binaries work on 10.7). You can easily try it, however, to convince yourself. Extract them with Pacifist to some temp directory and just run them (eg. extract ntpd and do a code./ntpd --version/code ). If you don't get a segmentation fault and you get a printout of the version, you might be fine. However, there's a better option.  Instead of using Apple's binaries, you should compile NTP yourself. It's not difficult at all and it requires Xcode (which is free anyway).  See my answer to a similar question that was posted the other day on how to compile NTP: Disabling NTP on OS X Lion or older  <answer163542> As MelB mentioned installing the 10.8 NTP update.dmg in Snow Leopard will not work.  But compiling it yourself is easy:  Prerequisites: XCode 3.2.6  ul liGet XCode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3    To get XCode 3.2.6 register at Apple Developer. You may sign in with an Apple ID and after hitting a lot of radio buttons you are in. Go to the downloads section and search for 'XCode 3.2.6' in the downloads section.br Download 'xcode_3.2.6_and_ios_sdk_4.3.dmg' (4.14 GB) and install it.

You would need versions compiled on 10.6.   Other answers mentioned how to compile them.  It requires downloading the source code, the patch, and having Xcode installed.  If you want to save a few steps, compiled patched versions of the files for 10.6.8 can be found here: https://github.com/MacMiniVault/NTPUpdateSnowLeopard/tree/master/usr  If you want a quick installer, they're packaged up for an easy install here: https://github.com/MacMiniVault/NTPUpdateSnowLeopard/releases
