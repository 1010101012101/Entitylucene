Case sensitive file system and app compatibility <body> Is there a list of applications and dev tools that do not work with journaled case sensitive file system?   My personal preference is to have case sensitive file system but I just found out that some stuff mighty not work on it. Adobe software might have issues, Steam, etc. Things that I am most worried about are Git, Homebrew, Nodejs, Bower, ZSH, etc.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. I failed at searching for anything that even mentions it.
