RSS reader with adblock <body> Is there any RSS reader with a built-in adblock or a plugin to an RSS reader?  I would also be preferable if it had Google Reader integration.  <answer54396> I've added this rule to the end of code/Applications/Reeder.app/Contents/Resources/article.css/code:  precodeiframe[src*="feedads"], iframe[src*="doubleclick"], iframe[src*="plusone.google"], a[href*=".ads."], a[href*="feedads"], a[href*="feedburner"], a[href*="doubleclick"], a[href*="//ads."], a[href*="api.tweetmeme"], a[href*="delicious.com/post?"], a[href*="digg.com/submit?"], a[href*="google.com/bookmarks/mark?"], a[href*="posterous.com/share?"], a[href*="tumblr.com/share?"], a[href*="linkedin.com/shareArticle?"], a[href*="facebook.com/share.php?"], a[href*="http://twitter.com/home?"], a[href*="addtoany.com/share_save"], a[href*="twitter.com/share?"], a[href*="pheedcontent.com/"], a[href*="feeds.wordpress.com/"], img[src*=".ads."], img[src*="//ads."], img[src*="doubleclick"], img[src*="feedads"], img[src*="feedburner"], img[src*="share-buttons"], img[src*="pheedo.com/"] {     display: none !important; } /code/pre  Most of the selectors were taken from a CSS file posted by the original developer of NetNewsWire.  You could also block domains that serve ads in /etc/hosts.  <comment62260> Does this works when viewing the full article or just the preview? <comment62261> It doesn't affect the combined view that shows articles inline or the built in browser. (But at least I've never needed to use either of them.) <comment62285> I need it to work with the built in browser <comment78184> Here's the path to the mentioned css file: /Applications/Reeder.app/Contents/Resources/article.css. Just add to the end. <comment168271> For a more thorough list of elements to hide, see the "General element hiding rules" section in EasyList's ad block rules: https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt
