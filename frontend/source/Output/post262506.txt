How to clean system space <body> My system space takes up to 40gb. It used to gobble up 20 gb and it was nice.  How to clean this space? How do I diagnose which program takes much space? I prefer to do it via terminal, not some expensive tools.   <comment328900> I don't know, but I think this may be a radical new concept, but here goes, delete something maybe? are you running Sierra? if so, go to the apple logo in the top left, click it scroll down to about my mac, storage tab, give it a moment, and then click on manage, you should be able to address the issue there. Optimise storage, enable that if you've not already.
