After Yosemite upgrade I can't use Bootcamp partition <body> Apple tech at store installed Yosemite upgrade on my dual-boot MBP.  After I got home I discovered that when holding down Option key during bootup my Bootcamp Windows partition is no longer displayed as an option.  When in OSX I can see Bootcamp (Windows 8.1) partition in Disk Utility, and I can see its contents in Finder. When I set Startup Disk to default to Bootcamp Windows Partition and then rebooted I eventually got a "no boot device found" error.  I'm hoping there's a way to repair this.   Have Gdisk, will follow instructions.  Thanks.  <comment248755> 'Genius ' is an iTunes song-matching algorithm... I'm not sure how it may have any interaction with an OS upgrade. <comment248762> @Tetsujin I think that he means an Apple employee at a Genius Bar in an Apple Store. <comment248782> Okay, an Apple Employee at the _Genius Bar_.  Now to the actual problem at hand... <comment248854> There is a lengthy discussion on the Apple discussion boards about this https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6607272
