MacBook Air sleep with external monitor attached <body> I would like my MacBook Air running Yosemite to sleep once I close the lid, even if an external monitor is attached.  Before Yosemite this could be achieved with codesudo nvram boot-args=iog=0x0/code. This has stopped working after the upgrade.  Is there another or a new way to achieve the effect I want?  <answer163444> You have to disconnect it from power. Then it will sleep. Seems like no other solution is found yet.  And your question seems to be a duplicate â€” How to disable Clamshell mode in Yosemite?
