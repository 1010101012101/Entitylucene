Getting rid of the special photo albums on iOS, e.g., People <body> In the Photos app on my iOS devices, there is the "People" album in addition to the "People From My Mac" album. It seems silly to have both. How can I get rid of the former?  I'd also like to get rid of the "Selfies" and "Panoramas" albums.  FYI: on my Mac on iTunes  iPhone  Photos  Albums, none of "All albums," "Favorites," "Videos," "Last Import," "Selfies," "Panoramas," nor "Screenshots" are checked; only "Albums" and all the albums therein are checked. Additionally, under People, "All people" is checked. Lastly, under "Sync Photos," only "Selected albums" is selected.
