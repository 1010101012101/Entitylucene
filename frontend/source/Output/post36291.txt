How to mail link from mobile Safari to an Exchange address book entry? <body> When selecting Mail Link to this Page from mobile Safari, no Exchange address groups are available when attempting to insert a recipient ("Choose a contact to mail").  Also, Outlook Personal Contacts are listed as part of the displayed All Contacts view, but not the Global Address List group. Contrast this with the mail-link case with Photos (native app) or Mercury browser.   Thank you.

You'll have to browse All Contacts for the contacts you wish to share the page with.   <comment41523> Thanks, but the Global Address List is not shown in the Groups list view, nor is it queried from the All Contacts view. Try selecting an Exchange address group in a compose from Safari vs the same case using Photos or Mercury or Maps.
