MacBook Pro replacment battery recommendations <body> I need to replace the battery in my MacBook Pro early 2011. Since my Mac is quite old I am looking for less expensive non-original replacement battery. I only need it to get me through one more year.  Do you have any experience with 3rd-party MacBook Pro batteries? Which brand is the best alternative?  <answer229196> In looking at this MacRumors thread, replacement Apple batteries are not much more expensive than third-party replacements. For a 2011 MacBook Pro, Apple quoted this person $130 for a replacement battery. With iFixit's replacement costing $99, I would definitely have it replaced through Apple. The work is warrantied, you wouldn't be responsible in case something goes wrong, and you will have a much more reliable battery (good for ~1000 charge cycles). Before I made any decision, I would schedule a Genius Bar appointment to get an exact quote, but I think getting it done professionally through Apple will be your best bet.
