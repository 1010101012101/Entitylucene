Mac book Pro [2011 model] - Screen bit distorted and greenish tint and does not boot completely after the apple logo and progress bar loads <body> My Macbook Pro hung so I forced restarted it but on restart the screen was bit distorted and had greenish tint (Picture below) also it never goes past the Apple logo and progress bar to boot completely. I tried to launch the recovery mode but I couldn't find a way to do it with reFind installed. Has anybody here faced this issue or know how to fix this?  reFind Boot menu img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cy0ht.jpg" alt="Mac book - reFind boot loader menu"  Apple logo with progress bar (Progress bar distorted) img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U3sxh.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  After this screen I see blank gray screen then Mac shuts down abruptly on its own. Macbook is running OS X Yosemite and is 2011 model.  <answer221504> Since your MBP is a 2011 model, the chance is that it is affected by faulty descrete AMD GPU. Almost all the Early and Late 2011 MBPs with descrete GPU are affected by this. I too had the same issue with my MBP and was fixed by Apple for free. It has been 9 months since the fix and it seems to be ok.  Apple has already issued a free replacement program for faulty logicboards in February 2015 till February 2016. Better you hurry and go to nearest Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Center. Find more details in the link below.  Apple MacBook Pro video issues
