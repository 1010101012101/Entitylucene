adding my phone number to my mac w/out another apple device <body> I accidentally signed out of my imessage account on my mac a while back. I have now lost my iphone so I have logged back in so I can use my mac to communicate meanwhile I get a new phone. When I signed back on my phone number was not listed next to my icloud email. All i find on the web to fix my problem through an iphone or an ipad. I do not have either. I do have an apple watch but I doubt it'll be any help. Is there another way to add my phone number????? Help
