How do I open images in Preview at full size? <body> Is there a way I can get Preview to open images in Actual Size by default and not have it fit to screen? I vaguely remember this as an option in previous versions of Preview, but am unable to find anything in the current version. System is 10.7.3 with Preview Version 5.5.1 (719.11).  <answer39869> ViewActual Size or kbdCommand/kbd + kbd0 (zero)/kbd:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KPLnz.png" alt="View&gt;Actual Size"  <comment45155> Thanks, but I know how to do that. I am asking about having it default to opening at full size. Not opening, then changing size. <comment57565> I think the most bothersome issue is when you Command + 0 (zero) and turn to the next page, it reverts to Fit to Screen and then you have to change it again; very annoying for reading many pages.
