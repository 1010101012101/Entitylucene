Remove On-screen volume display from ipad <body> I want to stop the onscreen volume display from popping up when I change the volume.   The icon is too big and blocks the center of my screen, and stays there for a second or two. I know I'm changing the volume - I'm pressing the buttons!  Is there a way to disable this icon?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i3KRg.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer231280> I would suspect your volume button might be stuck.  I have an iPad with a similar problem, and what I do is use AssistiveTouch's Device  Volume Control (tap a few times) to dismiss the popup.  <answer231493> As far as I know, no there's not. The indicator isn't there to tell you you changed the volume as much as its there to tell you what you've changed the volume to.  <answer271866> If you jailbreak, there's some tweaks that remove this or move it to the status bar.  <comment282400> Have you restarted your iPad to attempt to resolve ? <comment282506> @Tyson I believe he doesnt want it to show up when changing the volume. <comment341719> We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and context. Don't just give a one-line answer; explain why your answer is right, ideally with citations. Answers that don't include explanations may be removed. <comment342192> Thank you. I've been using this for a while now. I wish there was a neater way... though once I got used to it it's not bad. <comment362064> And I switched to a new case and the volume stopped changing at random intervals.
