How to monitor iphone bandwidth for app testing? <body> I'm testing an iphone app someone has developed for me. It seems that some of the files the app downloads are too large.   Is there an app that monitors the network to allow me how much data my app consumes?  <answer48779> If your developer has given you the source code you could use Instruments.app which can be used to monitor network activity.  ol liOpen the project in Xcode/li liSelect Product-Profile from the menu/li liWhen Instruments opens select 'Activity Monitor' and then hit record/li /ol  <answer48788> Assuming the app uses HTTP(S) to download its file, use A HREF="http://mitmproxy.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"mitmproxy/A. It alows you to follow live all the GET requests done by the app, even when it uses https. It requires Python.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bFv6k.png" alt="enter image description here"  Instructions on how to use (from the guy who nabbed Path's addressbook upload):  ol liDownload the mitmproxy tool and set it up by going to the folder of mitmproxy and running sudo python setup.py install. If all goes well, mitmproxy must be available in your $PATH./li liStart mitmproxy by running mitmproxy./li liObtain the IP address of your computer by running ifconfig en1 (or whatever is the interface that you are using)./li liSet the proxy on your iPhone by going to your wireless settings, setting the proxy to be “Manual”, and set the IP to be your computer’s IP and the port as 8080./li /ol  <comment55798> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=iphone+bandwidth+monitor. Or better, connect the iPhone to a WiFi router that you control and check the bandwidth there. <comment55851> thanks. Those bandwidth monitors are not as detailed, looks like MB is the smallest increment they report on. I'm looking for something that reports kbytes. <comment55856> sorry, don't have Xcode or the source code, just the app. <comment55857> the try to put the iphone behind a router that has can measure the bandwidth <comment55873> very cool! thanks!
