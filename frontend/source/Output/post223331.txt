How to disable Game Center process (gamed) on OS X 10.11 El Capitan? <body> It seems i can't edit the plist file from LaunchAgents—even if I sudo, I'm prevented from any deletion/alteration.  Do I have to necessarily disable SIP to do this?  <answer223334> what about codesudo launchctl unload /System/Library/Launch\ Daemons/com.apple.gamed.plist/code ?  <answer223340> Disable the LaunchAgent (not LaunchDaemons) and reboot your machine (strongwithout/strong sudo):  precode$ launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist /code/pre  In case you want to enable it again at one point:  precode$ launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist /code/pre  <answer226925> You have to first enter codecsrutil disable/code in Terminal when in Recovery Mode, then restart make changes, restart again in Recovery Mode and do codecsrutil enable/code, restart.  But I do not know which processes when modified will compromise boot in El Capitan  <answer242697> According to this thread you can also do something like:  precodedefaults write com.apple.gamed Disabled -bool true /code/pre  And to check the current state of the daemon use:  precodedefaults read com.apple.gamed Disabled /code/pre  <answer283803> on OS Sierra go to System Settings, Internet Accounts and delete (with the minus) the Game Center on the list (left side).  <answer292714> The answer from user169708 is in fact on the right track, but is poorly explained.  The problem is that the accepted answer given above:  precodelaunchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist /code/pre  no longer works. I have also seen it using the -w flag. In any case, in recent updates, I think around El Capitan or Yosemite, you instead get a message "Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged." System Integrity Protection is also known by the acronym SIP.  The command "csrutil disable" given by user169708 is needed to disable SIP. It must be executed from the Recovery OS.  I have done this sequence in previous releases and it did lead to being able to disable gamed via the launchctl command.  I am not sure at this point if this a all such a good idea, and what the downsides might be. It would be better for Apple to make such unwanted and unimportant functions more easily disabled.  I suppose that after gamed is disabled, one could re-enable SIP. Maybe that would be the best of both worlds, although it is a tedious process all in all.  <answer294643> One solution is to create a bash script to stop the gamed service after you login. Use Automator in OS X to create a bash script then add it as a Login Item to your OS X account. The next time you login you should receive a prompt to execute the script. Normally I wait until I see an alert from Little Snitch that gamed is phoning home then I click 'Continue' to run the script. This has not been perfected and you may encounter issues if you run it immediately after you login to OS X.  I prefer to stay away from the solutions that disable the service as those require disabling/overriding SIP which I advise against.  Here is the bash script I use. Any suggestions on improving it are welcome.  precode    #!/bin/bash         chkService=gamed         chkCount=10         chkStatus=$(ps ax | grep "$chkService" | grep -v grep | grep " T " | wc -l)         while [ $chkStatus -ne 1 ]; do             chkProcess=$(ps ax | grep -v grep | grep "$chkService" | wc -l)             if [ $chkProcess -ne 0 ];             then                 KILLALL -STOP "$chkService"                 chkCount=0                 chkStatus=$(ps ax | grep gamed | grep -v grep | grep " T " | wc -l)             else                 SLEEP=1                 chkCount=$((chkCount-1))             fi         done /code/pre  <comment270763> Did you try it & see what happens? <comment270767> /System/Library/Launch Daemons/com.apple.gamed.plist: No such file or directory --- I'm on 10.11.2 (thanks for the suggestion) <comment270774> my bad, it's a LaunchAgent : sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/Launch\ Agents/com.apple.gamed.plist <comment270775> it says: /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.gamed.plist: Could not find specified service I'm on 10.11.2; thanks for the suggestion! <comment270776> I just tried it on my machine and it worked fine. Same OS (10.11.2). Did you copy and paste the command from my answer? Edit: make sure to _not_ use `sudo` <comment270777> yep I did; check also inside the directory and the plist file is there… did you remove SIP/rootless by any chance in the past? <comment270778> thanks; the directory is LaunchAgents on my machine; upon using the right path i got a "Could not find specified service" that makes me sad <comment270779> No, I haven't: http://paste.frd.mn/loyon - Do you see the service in `launchctl list`? <comment270780> after rebooting, it disappeared from the list and little snitch is now quiet with gamed process—thanks! <comment270781> You're very welcome! <comment300030> This enables root login. What does it have to do with gamed? <comment313829> This is a really really bad idea from a security standpoint, and it doesn't address the question. <comment357887> This just deletes the Game Center account and doesn't disable the gamed process.  Also, this question is about El Capitan and not Sierra.  Please see [answer] for tips on how to provide good answers to questions. - From Review <comment364034> When trying this I get “Operation not permitted while System Integrity Protection is engaged” (and disabling SIP sounds like a *really* bad idea).
