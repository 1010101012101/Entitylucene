OS X Harddrive locking me out <body> I am trying to log into my mac (OS X Yosemite) but it keeps showing me this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2vVw.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I can't even go to recovery mode because when I hold option after rebooting, the only thing that comes up is "Macintosh HD" (My partition name).   So I installed El Capitan on a USB (from another computer) and used the recovery thing in there and it doesn't even show the Macintosh HD in there even though it's there when I hold the option key.   My Mac installation has to be there because when it boots up, I can see my background and my profile picture to login. I don't understand what's going on, please help me. I don't want to lose all my files.  <comment257482> That icon is called the **prohibitory sign**. When running from the USB, what does it show in Disk Utility? <comment257485> @IronCraftMan It shows this: http://i.imgur.com/7OlhMPw.jpg <comment257486> Under internal  disk0s4, what does it say? <comment257487> disk0s4 is just an empty partition, doesn't say anything. I verified the disk and it says no problems found. <comment257489> how big is it? It might be your Macintosh HD. <comment257490> It's only 50GB. My mac was 200gb. <comment257651> why is there a 50GB partition on your hard drive? Is it for Boot Camp? Additional storage? <comment257654> It was for Ubuntu. I erased it though, I think that might have had something to do with this problem but I don't understand how or why. <comment257680> please include those details in your question. How did you erase it and when?
