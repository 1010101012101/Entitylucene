Can't access recovery mode because i delete everything from HD <body> My Macbook PRO 13 inch of 2011 is booting to a black screen, i was trying to recovery it but the original HD was failing to install the OS, so i installed in a pen drive, then i erased everything in the HD, and then i accidentally erased everything in the pen drive, so i don't have anything in the pen drive and anything in the HD. I also have a fresh SSD, but when i try to startup with this new SSD, i only see a black screen.  I already try things like:  Remove the battery cable Press Command + Option + R + P Press Command + OPtion + R Press the power button 10 seconds Press the power button 30 seconds  Also, before the black screen, i see this lines like old television, it is fast, but they always appear. Perhaps the problem could be the screen?  Thank you.  <answer285327> As mentioned by NoahL - use internet recovery mode.     First, check this: Computers that can be upgraded to use OS X   Internet Recovery. If you can use Network Recovery, then do the   following:        strongInstall OS X Using Internet Recovery/strong   Be sure you backup your files to an external drive or second internal drive because the   following procedure will remove everything from the hard drive.        strongBoot to the Internet Recovery HD:/strong   Restart the computer and after the chime press and hold down the COMMAND-OPTION- R keys until a globe   appears on the screen. Wait patiently - 15-20 minutes - until the   Recovery main menu appears.        strongPartition and Format the hard drive:/strong   Select Disk Utility from the main menu and click on the Continue button. After DU loads select   your newly installed hard drive (this is the entry with the mfgr.'s ID   and size) from the left side list. Click on the Partition tab in the   DU main window.      Under the Volume Scheme heading set the number of partitions from the   drop down menu to one. Click on the Options button, set the partition   scheme to GUID then click on the OK button. Set the format type to Mac   OS Extended (Journaled.) Click on the Partition button and wait until   the process has completed. Quit DU and return to the main menu.       strongReinstall OS X:/strong Select Reinstall OS X and click on the Continue button. Be sure to select the SSD.   Note: You will need an active   Internet connection. I suggest using Ethernet if possible because it   is three times faster than wireless.         This should restore the version   of OS X originally pre-installed on the computer.   <comment359792> Have you tried booting into internet recovery mode?
