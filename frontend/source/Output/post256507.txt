Really confused about how to reset SMC and PRAM and NVRAM on my Macs and iPad and iPhone? <body> Sometimes I find from searching Google that I can reset the SMC, PRAM and NVRAM. But different sources provide different instructions on how to do this.  I have a MacBook Pro and iMac. I also have an iPad Mini and an iPhone 5c and wonder how these can also be reset if needed.  Can someone please clear this up for me, or send me links to some info I can trust.   <answer256508> From Apple KB: Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) on your Mac     strongReset the SMC on Mac notebook computers/strong      First determine whether the battery is removable. Mac notebook   computers that have a nonremovable battery include MacBook Pro (Early   2009) and later, all models of MacBook Air, MacBook (Late 2009), and   MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015).

If the battery is nonremovable       ol   liShut down the Mac./li   liPlug in the MagSafe or USB-C power adapter to a power source and to your Mac./li   liUsing the built-in keyboard, press Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the keyboard, then press the power button at the same time./li   liRelease all keys, then press the power button again to turn on your Mac/li   /ol      If the battery is removable      ol   liShut down the Mac./li   liDisconnect the MagSafe power adapter from the Mac./li   liRemove the battery.

You can also shut down by   pressing and holding the power button for 5 seconds.   iOS devices don't have an SMC.  <answer256509> Sorry to hear you’re having problems. I hope the following clarifies things for you, but if these instructions do not help, you can always post specific questions about any problems you’re having.  strongSMC/strong  The reason for your confusion is that the instructions for resetting the System Management Controller (SMC) will differ depending on whether your device:  ul liruns from a built-in battery?/li liruns from a removable battery? /li lican only run from power off a wall socket?/li /ul  Below I will provide the instructions for all three possibilities.  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liKeep the MagSafe adapter (or power cable) strongplugged in/strong./li liPress at the same time kbdshift/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdcontrol/kbd (on the left side of the keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liLet go/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button./li /ol  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBooks etc that you can remove the battery from, here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li listrongDisconnect/strong the MagSafe plug (power cable) from the computer/li liRemove the battery/li liPress the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds and release/li liPut the battery back in/li liReconnect the MagSafe cord (or power cable)/li liTurn your computer back on with the power button/li /ol  strongFor iMacs, Mac Pros, Mac Minis, etc that only run from a power point in the wall/strong  ol liShut down your computer/li liUnplug it from power/li liPress and hold the kbdpower button/kbd for 5 seconds/li liPlug it back in and turn it on./li /ol  strongPRAM/NVRAM/strong  Now, the reason for your confusion about PRAM and NVRAM is that older Macs had what's called Parameter RAM (PRAM), newer Macs use Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory (NVRAM).   Until recently, the instructions for resetting this were the same regardless of your Mac model. However, the Late-2016 MacBook Pro models use a different process. Below are the steps for both scenarios.  strongResetting the PRAM/NVRAM on all models EXCEPT for Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong You have to make sure you press these keys before the gray screen appears or it won’t work./li listrongHold those keys down/strong until your Mac reboots again and you here the startup chime./li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongResetting the NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models/strong  For all Late-2016 MacBook Pro models (with and without Touch Bar) follow these steps:  ol listrongShut down your machine./strong Yes, a full shut down, not just logging out./li listrongPress the kbdpower button/kbd emand then/em immediately press the kbdcommand/kbdkbdoption/kbdkbdp/kbdkbdr/kbd keys./strong /li listrongKeep these keys pressed down for at least 20 seconds!/strong/li listrongLet go of the keys and let your Mac reboot normally./strong/li /ol  strongNote:/strong When you log back in you strongemmay/em/strong need to readjust some of your system preferences (e.g. speaker volume, screen resolution, startup disk selection, time zone information, etc).  strongiPods, iPhones, iPads/strong  Devices running iOS do not have an SMC or PRAM/NVRAM that you can reset like you do on Apple Macs.  However, most random issues can be resolved by rebooting your device. To do this, hold down the Power button and Home button simultaneously for about 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo appear. After your device reboots you may need to enter your passcode.  In more serious cases, you can also access a range of reset options from Settings  General  Reset. Be careful though when deciding if/which option to select.  <comment320055> Thank you! This really helps. thank you for also including how to reset my iPad and iPhone. <comment320056> Don't see a need to look for a problem behind the problem. The OP asks for instructions on how to reset the SMC etc. This is (and already has been) answerable easily. <comment335229> Just wanted to let you know I've just updated my answer to include the **new process for resetting NVRAM on Late-2016 MacBook Pro models**. <comment335240> Great! And thank you!
