You cannot sign with that identity and test it on your own Mac before submitting it to the Mac App Store - it won't pass GateKeeper validation.  If you want to create an installer for distribution outside the Mac App Store, you'll need to use a signing identity prefixed "Developer ID Installer".  <comment352816> What does `spctl --assess --type install -vvvvv Jâ€¦.pkg` return? The verbose flags should provide more information. <comment352817> @GrahamMiln - just added a screenshot with spctl verbose flagged
