Read files from Apple hard drive on PC <body> My MacBook Pro 2011 (with 10.10 Yosemite installed) has shuffled off its mortal coil. Unfortunately it contains import data to me.  I have removed the HDD from my MacBook and installed it internally to my PC running Windows 10. The HDD shows up on device manager, however It does not allow me to create a drive for it. And I have used HFSExplorer, however it cannot find the HDD.  <comment326673> Please add the OS X and the Windows/Linux operating system version. Did you enable FileVault in OS X or is your main OS X volume "corestoraged"? <comment326705> hello, the hdd was the main drive of the MacBook. the MacBook we running Yosemite and my PC is running windows 10 <comment326707> We also need the GUID partition type of the main OS X volume! I'm unsure wether diskpart can determine this, at least other tools like [gdisk](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gptfdisk/files/gptfdisk/1.0.1/gdisk-binaries/) do. <comment326826> @Joshua of X, You did not answer "_Did you enable FileVault in OS X or is your main OS X volume "corestoraged"?_" asked by klanomath in the first comment. Please answer all the questions that have been asked. <comment326889> No I do not even know what fileVault is sorry
