How do I edit PDF Annotation Text Properties after creation? <body> When I have a form that I don't want to print out and write on, I can simply use Preview.app's PDF Annotations feature in order to fill in the necessary fields, and print out the final result.  I have now done this and completely filled out a PDF file, but I'm making a few last minute changes and have run into a problem. The first couple of fields have an annotated text size that is nearly double that of the rest of the fields, and I wish to shrink them to be closer, if not exactly the same size.  But I am unable to do so;  If I click on the text field, as if to resize or move it, then open the Text Properties field and begin changing properties, they do not take effect. If I select text within the text field and again attempt to change properties, they still do not take effect.  Shy of deleting the field and re-typing it with the text properties adjusted prior to doing so, why am I unable to edit text color, size, etc.?  <answer35259> It does work in Lion, the way you tried it.    In Snow-Leopard you have to select the text itself to change the font(size) by first clicking/selecting the text-field to get the selection rectangle (for re-sizing or moving - as you described) and then click a second time on your text to select all the characters. Now your text should be selected (visible by the highlighting) and you will be able to change the font-size in the Text Properties field.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JsUko.png" alt="click_me"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8VxpF.png" alt="change_font"  Edit 2012-01-04:    I could reproduce the problem described and also found a simple solution. If you open your pdf and re-arrange pages or rotate them and then try to change the formating of existing text fields it (sometimes) fails.    The solution/fix is to click the window (menu-)bar of the "Fonts" window, then click on your text field again and finally chose the new font variant → and it will be applied :D  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/czMva.png" alt="click fonts window bar"  <answer35300> To investigate the state of your annotations you could try this Automator workflow:    ul liAsk for Finder Items/li liGet Selected Finder Items/li liExtract PDF Annotations/li /ul  Maybe this gives you a hint why some of the annotations are locked for editing.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GK042.png" alt="pdf_annotations_workflow"  <comment40184> Ok, this is just weird. You're right, it does work exactly as I would have expected. But I obviously wrote this question for a reason, so what was I doing differently or wrong in the first place that made me write this up?! (That's a rhetorical question, btw.) <comment40202> Ok, I think I didn't read the question thoroughly enough. Does this occur only with a certain file ? Maybe the pdf is corrupt, or the part with the annotations. Or can you reproduce the behavior ? Does it occur after saving the first time or after re-opening ? What OS version are you using ? <comment40223> Nonono. That was the 'rhetorical' part of the comment. All I'm saying is, I had this problem, I did exactly what you said in Lion (which I've used since the day it came out, and used when I had the problem that caused me to write this up), but now it works. I'm perplexed as to what I was doing differently before. <comment40235> A wild guess: sometimes (Apple-)applications lose the track of of pop-up windows and the settings are no longer applied (like the font-settings from the "Fonts" window). Most times it is sufficient to close and re-open the pop-up window to make it work again. In rare cases one has to restart the application. Happens to me in Pages and Numbers from time to time. <comment40367> I think I've narrowed down a specific flow in order to do this. Pretty much you have to open a file, open the annotations toolbar (Shift+Command+a, and then select an element, call up the Fonts picker from the Annotations Toolbar, or do whatever change you're going to make. Doing *anything else in Preview* first seems to blow the whole process out of the water. Could you (1) prove my inability to edit a document if something else is done and (2) prove my startup actions are true? (I'm mostly talking to Nathan, but iolsmit you're welcome to help.) <comment40469> I could reproduce that behavior and also found a fix: Click the window (menu-)bar of the "Fonts" window, then click on your text field again and finally chose the new font variant → and it will be applied. I updated my answer as well. Hope it works for you too. <comment40474> That's good enough for me. I'm glad we could figure this out, thank you so much!
