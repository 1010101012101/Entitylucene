How to make MacBook automatically connect to different wifi networks as desired? <body> My main router is located in the living room and creates a wifi hotspot, call it X. I've created an additional wifi hotspot in my bedroom, call it Y, using two powerline adaptors.  How do I make my MacBook automatically connect to X while I'm in the living room and to Y while I'm in the bedroom. Thanks.  <answer132042> OS X will connect to the Wi-Fi network with the strongest signal, although it won't switch immediately between networks to avoid disruption to the connection.  You can alleviate this by stronghaving the same SSID for both networks/strong, which will cause OS X to see them as a single network and switch between them automatically.  <comment263252> This answer is not correct. OSX is notoriously bad for sticking with a network until the bitter end.
