New iPhone SE won't add contacts <body> My new iPhone SE will not save new contacts, either by Airdrop, text, email or direct entry.  It acts normal throughout the saving process but the new contact does not show up when I open Contacts.  <comment297427> What do you see when you open Contacts and press Groups on the top left. Is everything checked? When you go to iCloud.com and add a contact, does it show up there?
