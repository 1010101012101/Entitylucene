How do I restore the default folder icon? <body> I build web sites on a Mac and after the recent upgrade to Mavericks, the icon for all of my web template folders have changed from the standard Mac folder icon to the Parallels icon. I can change it using Get Info, but this has to be done one folder at a time and is unnecessarily tedious.  Has anyone else encountered this, and more importantly does anyone know how to reset the default to display the standard blue Mac folder icon?
