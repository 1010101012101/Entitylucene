How to get UTF-8 locale when connecting via SSH to MacOSX from PuTTY (Windows) <body> I have the following problem. When I connect to the server via ssh (client is PuTTY under Windows), I don't get UTF-8 locale. Here is what I see on MacOSX (Yosemite) after ssh connection:  precode$ locale LANG= LC_COLLATE="C" LC_CTYPE="C" LC_MESSAGES="C" LC_MONETARY="C" LC_NUMERIC="C" LC_TIME="C" LC_ALL= /code/pre  The thing is that I use the same settings for my Linux connections and on Linux I don't have these problems with locale. So, this might be a problem on the MacOSX side, not on the PuTTY's side.  Any ideas how to have UTF-8?  <answer158675> Solved my problem using Stack Overflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7165108/in-osx-lion-lang-is-not-set-to-utf8-how-fix  The most important part of the answer:     Try adding or editing the code~/.profile/code file for it to correctly export   your locale settings upon initiating a new session.  precodeexport LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 /code/pre
