Simple 3 line applescript - Error -128 <body> I have a scenario where I'd like 2 separate applescripts.  The idea is super simple. 2 Applications, but only one runs at a time.  Example: Close application 1, launch application 2 (and vise versa)  Here are the 2 scripts I have:  A.) OpenSteam  precodetell application "Plex Home Theater" to quit delay 5 tell application "Steam" to activate /code/pre  B.) OpenPlex:  precodetell application "Steam" to quit delay 5 tell application "Plex Home Theater" to activate /code/pre  The script "OpenSteam" works perfectly fine. It does exactly what I want it to do. However, the same script in reverse (OpenPlex) does not seem to work.  Steam closes, but my script then gives me the following error *Note, Plex is not launched:  precodeerror "Steam got an error: User canceled." number -128 /code/pre  I have no idea what this means, and was hoping someone could help me out.  --  I got my initial information from here: https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/27945-harmony-one-custom-command/#entry179765 I have revised the example scripts to fit my needs.  <answer176144> Have you tried...  precodelaunch application "Plex Home Theater" /code/pre  <answer180732> Your headache lays with how Steam handles its exit status. Steam probably doesn't have applescript integration, so it considers a codequit/code command from applescript an unclean exit. It would still quit, but it will let you know about it. What you need is a way to ignore the error message and execute the rest of the script nevertheless.  precodetry     tell application "Steam" to quit     on error error_message number error_number         if error_number is equal to -128 then         --Keep Calm and Carry On         else             display dialog error_message         end if end try delay 5 tell application "Plex Home Theater" to activate /code/pre  You can combine the two scripts into one toggle/switch:  precodeset steamRunning to false set plexRunning to false  try     do shell script "pgrep -l -f 'Steam.app'"     set steamRunning to true end try  try     do shell script "pgrep -l -f 'Plex Home Theater'"     set plexRunning to true end try  if steamRunning is true and plexRunning is false then      try         tell application "Steam" to quit     on error error_message number error_number         if error_number is equal to 128 then             --Keep Calm and Carry On         else             display dialog error_message         end if     end try     delay 5     tell application "Plex Home Theater" to activate  end if   if steamRunning is false and plexRunning is true then      tell application "Plex Home Theater" to quit     delay 5     tell application "Steam" to activate  end if /code/pre  I don't have either app so I cannot debug. There could be multiple processes named "steam", given its game-thing, so I used "Steam.app", assuming that's the app name under code/Applications//code.  <comment207880> tell application "Plex Home Theater" to activate does work, if I re-run the script "OpenPlex", after Steam has been closed, then Plex will open. The script is halting upon closing Steam, which is the issue. <comment214942> Wow, thanks for these suggestions. When I get a chance I will test this out and see how it goes. <comment214949> So, I had to make it " if error_number is equal to -128 then", otherwise, the script would halt and give me a "display dialog error_message". Otherwise the script seems to work great now! I have to keep the scripts separate, because when I add them to my Harmony Remote, they will be separate tasks.
