Large ping times in normal mode, okay ping times in safe mode <body> I pinged google.com to see that ping times ranged from 54 ms to over 2000 ms on my MBA. After a quick isolation and testing, I figured that it was my MBA only issue. I log into safe mode on my MBA with Mountain Lion and I suddenly get ping times of around 15 to 30 ms, which I think are normal from my place and thus okay.   Now that I know ping times are okay in safe mode, how do I hunt down, what might be the issue with my MBA in normal mode? Any clear procedure you advise?   <answer69524> This issue affected several people after upgrading to Mountain Lion. For many, reducing their MTU size solved the issue:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongNetwork/strong./li liSelect your connection and choose strongAdvanced.../strong/li liSelect strongHardware/strong./li liChange strongConfiguration/strong to strongManually/strong/li liReduce the MTU size to 1300. Most people had good experiences with this value./li liObserve how codeping/code behaves over time. You can further reduce the MTU size in steps of 4./li /ol  However, there seems to be another issue: Proxies. The solution suggested here is:  ol liOpen strongSystem Preferences/strong./li liSelect strongNetwork/strong./li liSelect your connection and choose strongAdvanced.../strong/li liSelect strongProxies/strong./li liTurn off strongAuto Discovery Proxies/strong./li listrongApply/strong the settings./li /ol  But this should be fixed with an upgrade to OS X 10.8.1 (not sure if an upgrade to Mountain Lion directly brings you to the latest upgrade, or to 10.8.0).  Actually, I would first try the upgrade to 10.8.1. If this does not work, try the proxy solution. If this does not work, try the MTU size reduction.  <comment80601> What DNS server are you using? Do you have any networking extensions installed? <comment80893> The latest Mountain Lion update fixed it! Thanks.
