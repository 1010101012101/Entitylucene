Confused about Compressed option in Disk Utility? <body> When I use Disk Utility to create an image, it gives me five options:   ul liRead only/li liCompressed/li liRead/Write/li liDVD/CD Master/li liHybrid Image/li /ul  Most of these make sense to me why someone would prefer one option over another option, except for Compressed.  I tested it out and the Compressed option made my image nearly half the size of the uncompressed version, which is great.    Now, I don't know for sure by I am assuming that this Compressed format is either Read only or Read/Write and if this is the case, strongwhy would you ever choose one of those formats over Compressed?/strong    I did not experience any loss of data when I did the Compressed and given the significantly smaller file size it seems like a no-brainer to always choose Compressed. Maybe I am making some wrong assumptions here...  <answer240405> When you create an image and you select Compressed, you are doing so at the sake of speed and read/write capability  To access the data on a compressed image, you have to uncompress it first; that takes cycles (cpu time).  Secondly, per Apple, the image is read only, not read/write so you will lose that capability as well.  The "Compressed" format is great for archival of data, not for daily access.  <comment295702> perfect, thank you for clearing that up :)
