How to recover files on USB stick <body> I used my USB stick on a PC as usual, than I put it in a Mac at work. Now I put it again in my PC and I can't see any of the files on it. How can I fix it and see the files again?  <comment250397> Please add some fundamental informations like system versions of the Mac and the PC to your question. Did you format the thumb drive while it was attached to the Mac? What kind of file system does the thumb drive have etc.? <comment250406> To get a lot of useful information for analysis quickly, plug the stick into your Mac again, open Terminal and run `diskutil info /Volumes/NAME-OF-STICK`. Then paste the output into the question.
