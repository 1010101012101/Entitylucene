Can I import my S/MIME cert in OSX 10.11.1 <body> I try to create own CA and sign created certificates according to procedure described here: serverfault: Can I Create My Own S/MIME Certificate for Email Encryption?  It works perfectly on my Linux machine. I can import certificates to Thunderbird, sign and encrypt emails.  But I have a problem in AppleMail on Mac OS X 10.11.1. It is possible to import to keychain ca.crt but individual certs .p12 are impossible to import.  Any idea what to do?
