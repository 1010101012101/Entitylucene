iPhone setting to turn off auto-detection of phone numbers? <body> In Safari and the Notes app on iPhone, wherever there are strings of numbers they get linked and treated as phone numbers.  I'm sure there was a setting to turn this off but I cannot find it. Where is it?  (Note: I'm not asking for how to prevent this happening on web pages as in this question, just a setting for my phone.)  <answer141188> It is currently strongnot/strong possible to disable the automatic linking for phone numbers, web addresses, and email addresses on iOS 7, and it never has been possible on previous iOS versions.
