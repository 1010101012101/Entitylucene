Options for playing music wirelessly from iPod touch and iPhone? <body> What are the options for playing music from an iPod touch over speakers in multiple rooms, preferably with the ability to turn speakers off in a specific room using a remote? I currently have a basic stereo system but it's about 5 years old, only has two speakers, and doesn't support Bluetooth so I'm not sure if it's worth trying to use with the iPod for this type of setup. Cost isnâ€™t an issue at least until I figure out what the options are.  <answer1008> Well, if your stereo has an audio in port, you can go with an Airport Express and send the music wirelessly from iTunes/Front Row on your computer.  http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/features/airtunes.html  You could use your iPhone/iPod as a remote using Apple's free Remote app.  I hope this helps.  <answer1009> Today Apple announced that the upcoming iOS 4.2 update coming in November will contain a feature called AirPlay where you can stream music, video, and photos directly from your iOS device to a new Apple TV (and presumably the Airport Express).  <answer71349> Since my speaker system is hooked up to my desktop computer I use Shairport4w to airplay music and podcasts from my iphone to my desktop.  <comment27531> To add to this answer, I'd just like to say you can buy a BlackBerry Stereo Gateway, which Bluetooths to your device and then sends all sound to the attached speaker. I use it at school for playing our Drama play's music and it works well. <comment81974> It's really never too late to accept an answer or edit a question to help someone get you the answer you seek...
