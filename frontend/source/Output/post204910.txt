How to save emailed video into Photos program? <body> I'm just now getting used to Photos. When someone emails me a video, I can't just drag it into my photos library like I could with iPhoto. How do I add it to my existing library?  <answer204913> strongSave Attachment/strong  ol liRight click the video in Mail./li liSelect "Save Attachment"./li liGo to where you saved it in Finder. /li liDrag it into Photos./li /ol  It may take it a while, depending on the age of your Mac, how big the video is, etc.  <comment247432> OK, that seems like a clunky way of doing things, unlike previously where you could just select "import to iphotos" directly from the mail program...so there is no short cut any longer? <comment247433> @Meg No, there's nothing like that.
