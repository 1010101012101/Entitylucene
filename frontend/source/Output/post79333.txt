SSD OEM Exact Model, Part Number and Manufacturer in MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) <body> Does anyone know the exact manufacturer, Apple part number or model number of a 512GB SSD drive in a BTO MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)?   I cannot find any teardown photos or System Information screenshots online. This would really help inform my decision on what SSD to purchase.   Note: I am asking for information about specific hardware specs that I can not find anywhere online and are not publicly available from Apple. I am not asking how to use System Information.  <answer79360> Try this:  ol liApple menu/li liAbout this Mac/li liMore Info.../li liSystem Report/li liSerial ATA/li /ol  I don't know how many vendors produce this size SSD for Apple but I have a 15" early 2011 MacBook Pro with a 512GB SSD in it from Apple and the model is APPLE SSD TS512C.  A search online for "APPLE SSD TS512C" gives me a discussion on this very site:  What brand of SSD does apple use for their LATE 2011 MacBook Pros?  Looks like they were using Toshiba and Samsung back then. That may have changed in a year but I doubt it.  <answer79704> It is a Samsung 830 (SM512E) for both the Retina and non-Retina Mid-2012 Macbook Pro.

I do not own one of these machines, so I have no access to the System Report. I am looking for the information on the mid-2012 model newer SSD drives. <comment92079> Thanks, the Apple Forums and MacRumors links nailed it. <comment92080> Also, the Anandtech link is a teardown of the Retina model. It is answered at Apple Forums link in the (as of today) last response.
