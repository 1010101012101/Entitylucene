Using automator, sort objects by type into type folders, inside subfolders <body> long time no ask! Anyway, I've been tasked with a project that involves sorting folders into new folders based on type. I've been working on an Automator action, but I haven't had much success. What I'd like to have the folder structure look like is:     Main Folder       precode           -Movie  /code/pre           precode               -Project name           -Photo                -Project name           -Document                 -Project name           -Audio                -Project name /code/pre           I can sort my folder into the audio/photo/movie/document folders, but I cannot make new subfolders and move my items into them, I simply lack the knowledge. Any suggestions would be really helpful. Thanks!  EDIT: here is what I have so far: https://mega.co.nz/#!HQN1GK6C!WvBvDOAt_5116hAoIAIhXTWIfg9fNKjxZxIgG-AHWRk  <comment202200> you tagged applescript, but want to use automator. It can be done with both. share what you've done so far so there isn't wasted time on anyones behalf <comment202201> @soulshined I tagged it as both, not knowing what would be better to use. I'll upload the workflow. <comment202203> upload it as a workflow not as an app <comment202204> @soulshined in Yosemite, (for me) it saves workflows as apps, you should be able to open it in Workflow (drag the app on the Automator icon) <comment202205> you can elect to save it as a workflow when you save it. <comment202206> disregard...the first download was corrupted
