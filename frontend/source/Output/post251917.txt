I only see the "Other" account option on log in screen <body> So i start up my macbook air after about 3 months of not using it, and i don't see any accounts on the log in screen, except for "Other," and I try to type in my old information, that doesn't work, and there's no option to create an account, so how can i create a new account?  <answer252120> Starting with 10.10 you can use the codesysadminctl/code command to create users, assuming you're able to ssh in or something:  precodesudo sysadminctl -addUser username -fullName "User Name" -password - -admin /code/pre  <comment313305> This feels like an [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info) to me. Why not ask for the solution to your problem rather than for a method to achieve something else?
