Web fonts look worse after deleting MS Office <body> I recently deleted my MS Office 2011 and decided to use only iWork or Libre Office or LaTeX. The problem is, now fonts on all browsers look worse than before. I have no idea why this is so, it only started after I deleted Office and its fonts, and I don't even remember how they looked like before I installed Office.  Is there any way to enhance the fonts used for web browsers? Fonts in all other applications look fine.  <answer47831> Your font are probably corrupt. But no worries, you can restore them with almost no effort :)  ol liOpen fontbook/li liSelect all the fonts/li liRight click and select validate. All the fonts Office installed that are bad will show warnings. /li liRemove those, and you'll be good as new without a reinstall of anything./li /ol  Let me know if this helps you out!  <answer47840> I suppose that Office substituted system fonts when installed, and the uninstaller had them removed or disabled. You could try restoring the standard (system) fonts by opening strongFont Book/strong and choosing strongRestore Standard Fonts.../strong from the File menu.  <comment54963> I don’t know why, but there was a folder called Fonts (Disabled) next to the /Library/Fonts folder. I had tried both solutions but they didn’t work. Then I moved the Fonts (Disabled) fonts (Times New Roman and Arial and Verdana etc.) to the /Library/Fonts folder, and it’s all normal again. But the tips were useful — they solved other problems I didn’t know I had.
