MacBook Air Running Yosemite - Merge Two User Accounts? <body> I am brand new to Mac.  I very recently migrated all of my files from my Windows PC.  When setting up my MacBook Air initially, I was instructed to create a user account.  When I migrated my files from the Windows PC, it created an entirely separate account.  Is there a process to combine the two together or possibly migrate files from one to the other and delete one account?  Thank you very much.  <answer227943> ul liFrom your main account open Finder and locate the user account for your pc files. (Macintosh HD/users/pcfiles)/li liRight or control click on that folder and select Get Info./li liUnder Sharing and Permissions click on the lock icon to unlock permissions.  Give admin password when asked./li liOnce unlocked, click on the + button and add your main ID to the user names/li liSet your permissions to Read &amp; Write./li liClick on the gear icon and make your main ID the "owner" of the folder./li liClick on the gear again and apply to enclosed items./li liClick on the lock icon to re-lock the folder./li /ul  Your main ID now owns the pc files.  You should be able to move files or folders to your main id file structure (no need to copy) or just access them as is.  You could import directly into iTunes or iPhoto etc.  <comment243455> How did you migrate from Windows PC? <comment243456> Ahh - I did the same thing recently. Given the offer of Migrating now or later, I chose later... I ended up trashing one account & just using the other. (Won't make that mistake again ;)  Would be interested to hear of a way, but I don't think there is one, other than manually copying data from one to the other. <comment243491> tetsujin is correct (as he usually is) Combining two user accounts is nothing more than copying the files you want from one to the other. Having never used the Apple migration tool (Windows to Mac) I'm not sure how, exactly, it works, but I do believe it creates a new user profile based on the one(s) you copied from the PC.
