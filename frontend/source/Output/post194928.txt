No iMessage since 8.4 update <body> I downloaded iOS 8.4 on my iPad and now I can't open Message nor can i open them in the setting menu. In addition, I can't scroll through the settings menu once it's opened. I have rebooted and reset network settings. Any suggestions?  <answer194931> The settings menu issue happens to my iPad when it is critically short on disk space. In those cases, I have to delete something (an app, or a video) and reboot the iPad to get it to work.
