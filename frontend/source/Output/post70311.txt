Ip blocked since I updated my Mac to Mountain Lion <body> Since I've upgraded my mac from lion to mountain lion, the ip 5.9.31.48 (api.shellycloud.com) appear to be down (ping said that "Host is down"). So I think that there is somewhere a firewall rule that block all request from this ip or hostname.  I use Little snwitch, so to be sure I've clossed it, same for the mountain lion build-in firewall. But nothing change, still down. I've checked my /etc/hosts to.  Does someone have any idea ?
