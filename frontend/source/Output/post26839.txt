I am using snow leopard  <answer26840> In Lion, there's a setting in System Preferences under Security &amp; Privacy asking how long after sleep or the screen saver begins is the password required.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YVqjX.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer121426> If anyone gets this problem you wont solve it with the above. You will need to go to system preferences and then energy saving and then set the time-out for battery and plug-in use. Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and enter Energy Saving. Once you're in you'll find it :)  <answer121442> Use this helpful app for easy toggling between locking or not: https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/caffeine/id411246225?mt=12  <answer268547> In macOS Sierra,   Click on apple icon Left top corner - System Preferences..

Perhaps this is a custom change in my office provided laptop? <comment238435> The question was how to delay the locking (i.e. requirement of username + password).  What you've described is how to change the delay before the screen turns off.  That's something else entirely.  The accepted answer is correct.
