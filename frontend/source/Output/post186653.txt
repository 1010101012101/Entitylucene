Reset screen saver settings on timer or on load <body> My company changes my screensaver settings to some default they want. I want to keep my settings, so I would like to change the settings either on a timer or on login back to the settings I have chosen.  Can someone suggest the best method for doing this? Every day I come in my screen saver settings have been reset  I run OS X Yosemite.  When i set it in screensaver settings I get the following from  codedefaults -currentHost read com.apple.screensaver/code  precode{     CleanExit = YES;     PrefsVersion = 100;     idleTime = 600;     moduleDict =     {         moduleName = Shell;         path = "/System/Library/Screen Savers/Shell.qtz";         type = 1;     };     moduleName = XXXXXX;     modulePath = "/System/Library/Screen Savers/Flurry.saver"; } /code/pre  I XXXXX'ed out the moduleName because it's set by the company  <answer186659> To automate the changing of the ScreenSaver one can use the Automator and a script command.  Open the Automator and create a workflow. Now drag the Calendar new event to the right and choose date/time. (you can change the Date/Time and the repeating occurrence later in the calendar app.  Next drag the "Run AppleScript" to the right and paste following in it between the * *  precodetell application "System Events" to set current screen saver to screen saver "Shell" /code/pre  Save your workflow:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DxbFg.jpg" alt="screensaver"  Replace "Shell" with one of following options of your choosing:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kguqA.jpg" alt="options"  Open calendar and adjust that event, and make it repeating, so from now on you will have a automatic screen saver change.  <answer186668> If you want to change screen saver with applescript:  precodetell application "System Events" to set current screen saver to screen saver "Flurry" /code/pre  Replace code"Flurry"/code with the screen saver you prefer.
