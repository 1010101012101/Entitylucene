Where May I (legally) get a Mac OS X .iso File to Virtualize OS X? <body> I want to virtualize a Mac (the latest, 10.9) on my Mac (MacBook Air). I prefer to use VirtualBox. After setting up the OS X guest, I need to provide a .iso file from which VirtualBox will install OS X. Where can I (legally) get such a .iso file? My Mac didn't come with installation media so I can't just create one from a disc.  <answer145179> These steps assume that you already have purchased OS X 10.9 through the Mac App Store.    ol liOpen the Mac App Store  /li liPress the kbdAlt/kbd Key and hold it during the following steps  /li liClick at the purchased tab  /li liScroll to OS X Mavericks  /li liClick at the Download button  /li liIf you already have OS X Mavericks installed, you will be asked if you want to continue  /li liClick continue  /li liNow, you can release the kbdAlt/kbd Key/li /ol  To get the dmg file:br 1. Go to the downloaded install application in the applications folderbr 2. kbdControl/kbd+click on the installer, and choose emShow Package Contents/em, and choose emShow Package Contents/em.br 3. Navigate to codeContents &gt; Shared Support/codebr 4. The file you are looking for is called codeInstallESD.dmg/code  If you need a code.iso/code file, you have to convert it using Disk Utility  <comment171065> Sorry about the duplicate. I did a search but it was not specific enough. <comment171080> Sadly, even after all that, I doubt the ISO will work with VirtualBox. From [this page](http://www.macbreaker.com/2014/05/os-x-mavericks-in-virtualbox-with-niresh.html): *Unfortunately, the standard "Unibeast" method for installing OS X Mavericks on PCs (which uses an official copy of the Mavericks installer) doesn't work with Virtualbox. Instead, you'll have to pirated "distros" of Mac OS X such as Niresh, which is now the most popular distro for Mavericks.* <comment336828> For install info see http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/106840/5231  VirtualBox supports a Mac-style EFI boot when using the Mac OS X type choices with "Enable EFI" selected, so you can boot an unaltered OS install. However, as noted in the answer I linked, the InstallESD.dmg from the Mavericks App is just plain not a bootable disk image even on a real Mac, so workarounds are necessary.
