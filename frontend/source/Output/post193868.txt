Disable notifications during a call on iPhone 5 iOS 8.3 <body> While I am talking on the phone, I often receive messages on Telegram or WhatsApp, or other notifications. And when I receive them they arrive in bursts, which is really annoying.  Is there a way to disable this behaviour? strongHow do I disable notifications only when Iâ€™m talking?/strong  iPhone 5 with iOS 8.3  <answer193875> This is not possible (at least on a non-jailbroken phone).  You can use Do Not Disturb, but you have to set it ahead of time so that it applies even while the phone is unlocked, and then toggle it on at the start of the call, and toggle it off at the end.
