Why coreservicesd keep going high? <body> Recently everything I do in finder is slow. If I go to activity monitor I see  coreservicesd 63% finder 37%  What's going one?  Some says I got to clear settings. I think all these happened after ccleaner or something.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PLRVd.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment97176> More detail. What OS version, etc.  Console log saying anything interesting? <comment97177> how to get all those information? <comment97178> Look for an app called Console. It came with your Mac.  The OS version is under System Information in the Apple menu (top left of screen.) <comment122578> I am still looking for better answers here. Basically go to disk utility and repair permission. Somehow it works. Not sure why.
