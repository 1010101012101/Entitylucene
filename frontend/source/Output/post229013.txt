How can I forward all my iCloud emails to a Gmail address? <body> As the title of the question states, I would like to forward my iCloud email to my Gmail address. Specifically, I have an iCloud email that I made with my Apple ID as well as a Gmail address I made back in 2012 or something. Most of my emails go to my Gmail address, but I would still like to use my iCloud address for a few specific things. I know the easy answer is "go into your mail app and set up a filter to forward everything to your Gmail address," but the only Apple device I have is an iPhone and (as far as I can tell) you can't make filters from there.   emGiven this information, how can I forward all my iCloud email to my Gmail address?/em  <answer229014> In iCloud Mail, click the Action pop-up menu in the sidebar (as in the picture), then choose Preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QkM4h.png" alt="enter image description here"  In the General pane, select codeForward my email to,/code then type the forwarding address in the text field.  If you donâ€™t want to store a copy of each forwarded message in iCloud, you can select: codeDelete messages after forwarding./code  Keep in mind that storing copies of forwarded messages decreases your available iCloud storage space.  At the end clink: codeDone/code.
