Can I receive messages sent and received from another iphone on my account? <body> Is there any way that I can make it to where I can receive the messages that are sent and received from another phone on my account? And will the other phone be notified somehow?  <answer131878> Yes, with iMessage signed into the same Apple ID, messages both sent and received appear on both devices. This will not include any SMS, only iMessages. Go to Settings  Messages  Send &amp; Receive to sign in with an Apple ID.  <comment215339> It includes SMS if you have the SMS relay feature enabled. I text from my iPad more than my iPhone.
