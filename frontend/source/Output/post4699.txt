How to set to open folder with enter in finder? <body> I want to set to open a folder in finder with kbdEnter/kbd.  I know it's possible to open a folder with kbd⌘ Command/kbd + kbd↓ Down Arrow/kbd but I don't like it and I never use it because it's easier to use the trackpad, but enter would be the easiest way.  I tried to set it trough the keyboard shortcuts but I can't do it.  <answer4700> As I know you can not set it to kbdenter/kbd in a normal way (but maybe exist some tricky way)  but you can change open shortcut by going to codeSystem Preferences/code  codeKeyboard/code  codeKeyboard  Shortcuts tab/code  from the left window choose codeApplication Shortcuts/code and press code+/code to add new shortcut then find codeFinder/code in Application and choose strongcodeOpen/code/strong in codeMenu Title/code and press any desired shortcut in textbox.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ULdwU.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer5799> PresButan (Mac OS X 10.4.x-10.7.x): An idiotically named solution to a spectacular UI oversight (rather apropos, eh?).br It also lets you use either the backspace or delete key to delete files.  I can confirm it works (just installed it). Apparently it leverages the accessibility system and uses a daemon to catch the return events.  If you are on 10.3-10.5, you also have the option of using ReturnOpen.  <answer65717> You could also use KeyRemap4MacBook, but it would make pressing return open items even in rename mode. And there are a lot of other places besides Finder where return renames items and other key combinations open them.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dDULq.png" alt=""  If you don't use a QWERTY keyboard layout, change codeKeyCode::O/code to codeKeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN/code:  precode&lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;Use Return as Open&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;private.app_finder_return2commandO&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;only&gt;FINDER&lt;/only&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::RETURN, ModifierFlag::FN, KeyCode::RETURN&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;--KeyToKey-- KeyCode::RETURN, KeyCode::CURSOR_DOWN, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  <answer140733> Any person new to Apple and Mac would find lot of things un-intuitive or just strongforced/strong on the user, w/o any options to change it. Or it might be that just many of us had their first experiences on Win/Linux systems.  But just found this plugin to finder XtraFinder which among lot of other options allows you to strongENTER/RETURN/strong to open a file.  Feeling a lot relieved now! Hope it helps.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pS4w2.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer295819> Edit: Well crud, got halfway through typing this up and then found that strongKarabiner doesn't work on Mac OS 10.12+/strong. They are working on Karabiner-Elements but it's still pre-alpha.   These instructions still work for 10.11 and lower though:   Karabiner was easier than the top answer here because you don't have to make a System Integrity Protection exception (El Cap).  ol liInstall app from here: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner//li liOpen Karabiner with Spotlight Search (Cmd+Space)/li liIn Karabiner search menu (upper left): "use return as open"/li liCheck the box/li liOption-click on Finder in taskbar, Relaunch it. /li /ol  <comment4576> thanks very much, howerver I cannot choose enter as the shortcut because it puts nothing as shortcut instead. I need to add something + enter but I wan just enter alone. What should I do? <comment4579> and in your screeshot there is `Finder.app` , when I select Finder fro the Application dropdown ads `Finder` <comment4580> @CIRK I set that My OS X show the Index so in my screen shot you see Finder.app but if you don't set it just show Finder. and also I said that you can not use enter in normal way (also can't use enter + something else it didn't work for me) I just want to show you a way to change system shortcut. <comment4853> Cmd+O works too btw :-) (not really answer to your question, I know). <comment4907> I would also add make the "Delete" key delete the selected item in finder. <comment6370> Don't think it's possible.  Up for "go up one level," down for "go down one level." Just get used to it.  You'll be fine, I'm sure. <comment6376> Furthermore, this actually *was* possible, until apple broke it, intentionally or not, in OS X 10.6. See  http://www.returnopen.com/ <comment17728> I'm pretty sure it's not a UI oversight as it was done deliberately. <comment17754> Ok, so it was deliberate. Then the inability to **change** the setting is a UI oversight. In either case, it's idiotic. <comment17767> I disagree. Not *everyone* expects or wants enter to open folders in the finder. Renaming folders is convenient with enter; using command + arrows for navigation makes sense and is easy. In list view, what's the "opposite" of enter? How do I get out of the folder? With command-up: open parent, command-down: open folder, it makes sense and is symmetrical. People who insist that it is "wrong" or "idiotic" are simply used to another OS. <comment17768> @Fake Name Using just the delete key to move an item to the trash is a bad idea. I'm editing a file name, I hit delete to delete characters. Oops, there it goes. Ah, you say, but the Finder checks what mode you're in. What if I forgot what mode I was in? Shortcuts need to be consistent. How hard is it to hold down command + delete? <comment17803> @ghoppe - Christ, did you read my comment? I additionally specified that the **inability to change the setting** is the really stupid thing. Also, the inverse of enter is backspace, as it has been since long ago. Apple is the one who decided we needed two delete keys, which still doesn't make much sense to me. <comment17804> @ghoppe - That's because OS X has that nutty "Two Delete keys" thing. The button above backslash is the backspace button. The button in near "Home" and "End" is the delete key. It's a hell of a lot harder to accidentally press when typing. <comment17805> @ghoppe - At best, the button above backspace should be "Backwards Delete". Apple decided to change key names on their own. As it is, they have "Delete", which is a backwards operation, and "Forward Delete", which is just delete everywhere else (And the key I am referring to). <comment17845> @Fake Name Sorry, I guess you have a non-standard usage of the phrase **in either case** which I am unfamiliar with.  Mac conventions (in the Finder) are that command *shortcuts* use the command key. This is in my view a good thing, it allows you to edit names without modal worries. Not allowing non-command key shortcuts seems to me to be a pretty minor shortcoming. Having multiple options to use other OS conventions is a big can of worms to open. I'm fine with third-party utilities for this. <comment17846> @Fake Name As for the two delete key thing, I'm not sure why Apple decided to go against ISO standards on that. Maybe because the backspace key on typewriters only moves the carriage and doesn't delete things and they wanted to be explicit? Regardless, it's a trivial difference. <comment77308> You could usually do something like `defaults write com.apple.finder NSUserKeyEquivalents '{Open="\r";}'; osascript -e 'quit app "Finder"'`, but it doesn't seem to work either. <comment253153> @ghoppe When you rename you're merely editing the text. Is OSX that much not contextual to just delete the text NOT file? <comment253359> @mahemadhi Read my comment closely. It does delete just the text *if you are in text editing mode*. But humans are not perfect, and I may have the file selected but not the text of the filename. <comment253445> @ghoppe You have undo anyway. Otherwise you could have confirmation dialog before file delete. It's a common UI pattern to show confirmation dialog before doing any operation results in data loss. <comment253446> @ghoppe Speaking of original question.. How frequent you rename than opening a folder? <comment253532> @mahemadhi There is no confirmation dialog since the file isn't immediately deleted, it goes to the trash. I generally don't open folders with the keyboard, when I do I'm in column or list view (I'm not an animal) so therefore I'm using arrow keys for navigation. Right Arrow opens folders. What could be easier? <comment261251> Ha, I didn't know about `⌘↓` Came to buy apples, getting some oranges instead. Enter would be nice, but I'm not installing an app to do it. <comment267784> XtraFinder is a great app, but it no longer works on El Capitan unless you disable System Integrity Protection. A solution that does work on El Capitan is **[Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)** (formerly known as KeyRemap4MacBook). Simply install Karabiner and then scroll down in its settings window to **For Applications** / **Enable at only Finder** / **Windows Explorer Navigation for Finder** and turn on **Use Return as Open**. There are a few different options there to set another key to Rename. I like **Use F2 to Rename** to make Finder consistent with Windows Explorer. <comment298260> @MichaelGeary Why not make this an answer? <comment363678> I disabled SIP gladly and installed XtraFinder.
