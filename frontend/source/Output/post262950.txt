osascript changes case in OSX10.12.1 <body> osascript is behaving weird after upgrading to 10.12.1. Prior to this version, the command works as below:  In 10.12, the output is in whatever case the input is:  precodedeppfx : ~ $ osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"Hello\"" deppfx : ~ $ Hello /code/pre  In 10.12.1, the output is forced to uppercase:  precodedeppfx : ~ $ osascript -e "tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"Hello\"" deppfx : ~ $ HELLO /code/pre  Does anyone know what's going on here?  <answer263700> Caps-lock is probably on. This inputs the text as if you typed it yourself, so it's affected by holding shift down, or having caps-lock on.  <comment330453> A direct caps-lock-on answer? No, it's not caps-lock. Thanks for trying to help though. <comment330492> Well, it doesn't do that for me, except for when caps-lock is on, or I'm holding shift down.
