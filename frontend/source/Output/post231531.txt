Unable to access certain sites in mac <body> I have just moved from a Windows laptop to a macbook air and I am facing an issue that certain web-sites are not loading in my mac - both Safari and Chrome browsers. In chrome I am getting the error as ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED and in Safari it shows as Server is not responding  Again reiterating, its only for a few sites I am getting this message and others are working fine. Any idea what I need to check?   P.S - On initial googling I have added both the browsers to the firewall exception list. Also please note that I am completely new to a mac and so need explicit instructions to follow (sorry for that - but till now I havent used anything else except Windows!!)  Let me know if I need to provide any other info!  <answer231539> This post from the Apple Support Communities might help: Link  Things to try according to this post:  ul liSettings/Networks/Advanced/Proxys, Discover new proxys/li liCheck the ignored domains for blocked domains/li liSafari/Preferences/Advanced - enable the Develop menu, then empty caches/li liSafari/History/Show History - delete all history items/li liRestart your router (obvious one, but often works well)/li /ul  One other thing to try:  - Change the DNS server to Google: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4  <comment282773> Thanks for the options. The other steps didnt resolve anything but changing DNS to Google helped!
