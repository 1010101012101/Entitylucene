Keyboard shortcut for Downloads folder? <body> I use kbd&#x2318;/kbd + kbdD/kbd whenever I go the the Desktop folder.

That used to be the key combination for the downloads window in Safari, and it now got moved to Finder. :P <comment27052> @neoneye I've updated this answer to reveal an alternative method that should work for you. Let me know if it works!
