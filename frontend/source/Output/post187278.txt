21:9 2560x1080 on Mini late 2012 <body> I just bought an LG 21:9 monitor, with a native resolution of 2560x1080p at 60 Hz.  Now, my mac mini late 2012 (HD4000) allow me to select resolutions up to 1920x1080p and no more.  The monitor is connected via HDMI, but the HDMI on the mini should be able to output up to 2560x1440p@60Hz...  Any advice?  <answer187281> According to MacTracker.app:  ul liDisplay Connection    1 - HDMI port or Thunderbolt digital video output/li liDisplay Support   Supports an HDMI-compatible device while using one Thunderbolt display or support for two Thunderbolt displays/li liDisplay Modes Dual display extended, video mirroring, and AirPlay Mirroring/li liExternal Resolution   Up to 2560 by 1600 (Thunderbolt) or strong1920 by 1200 (HDMI)/strong/li /ul  Concluding: You need a Thunderbolt display adapter for your new display  <comment221301> What the heck, ok.

I suppose I'll have to put the mac on DP and buy some adaptor for the ws
