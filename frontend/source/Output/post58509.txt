How can I open a single app by an unidentified developer without allowing all <body> I know to secure safety it is now not allowed anymore to open apps that were not downloaded from the mac app store.  But surely there is a workaround for this to open an app that you know is 'good' but just isn't in the app store. Preferably allowing only that app and not allowing all downloaded apps to be opened.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHECi.jpg" alt="screenshot"  How do I open an app that is not downloaded from the app store in mountain lion?  <answer58511> To enable a single unsigned app that you know to be safe, follow these steps:  ol liGo to strongSystem Preferences/strong, then strongSecurity and Privacy/strong, then click "Anywhere"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/B6Gsq.png" alt="enter image description here"/li liLaunch the app. This will remove the "unsigned download" warning status from the app./li liReturn to strongSystem Preferences/strong and return the Gatekeeper settings to the level you want (default is "Mac App Store and identified developers")/li /ol  Your app should launch as desired, but future downloaded apps will be subject to Gatekeeper scrutiny.  <answer58514> To enable the execution of an app against the policy that you have set in System Preferences, then you can simply right click on the app in question, and click open.  This will produce a further "Are you sure?" check, but will allow you to open an app and over-rule your app signature settings without you needing to go into System Preferences each time.    <answer58520> You can ignore the gatekeeper restrictions on a per-app basis by right/control-clicking and selecting "Open". And because the check is done only on the first open, you can run it normally afterwards.

They key to fix it is open codeTerminal.app/code (under code/Applications/Utilities/code) and type in  precodexattr -d com.apple.quarantine /code/pre  then at the end press space and drag the application you are trying to open in there, so it should look like this (this is an example for Google Chrome):  precodexattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Users/username/Desktop/Google\ Chrome.app /code/pre  (here emusername/em refers to the user account name)  <comment67329> hmm yes I see now... but I was looking to add the specific application to the 'white list'. But I guess this will have to do +1 for now if no one comes up with A better answer I'll accept this one. <comment67330> @FLY I didn't realize you were looking to whitelist only a single app. See edits. <comment67335> Good point! I wish that there were an option to manually allow a single app and not tear down the whole wall at once. <comment67337> An this has a permanent effect, right? If yes, that would be superb. <comment67338> Apparently, once you have run an app, regardless of what method you use to authenticate it, it's signature get's added to the permitted list and you are able to run it again without requiring to re-authenticate/confirm etc. <comment67341> This method is actually Apple's official way of doing it. <comment67342> I can confirm that this will always allow the app to run: [link](http://www.evernote.com/shard/s35/sh/c11836ba-a3a9-4274-8a06-c8ce954e810c/865df24bc168f7e1fdeeacb7d0e51f9a) <comment67343> The edits make the question much more clear. Great work! <comment67348> @cksum do you have a link to the official apple way would be nice to include that in the answer. <comment67351> @gentmatt if you wish to make an allowance or exception without changing what's in System Preferences, try http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/58522/8546 … should we have a separate question? <comment67358> @GrahamPerrin According to the accepted answer it's not necessary to change what we have in the System Preferences. I think the right-click option is very convient. Why do you want to post a separate question? <comment67364> I had [a brief discussion](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/5566746#5566746) with @gentmatt <comment67433> I deleted my answer – on closer inspection, reviewing past and present test results, it's probably applicable to a different aspect of Gatekeeper. Not for this question. <comment67485> @FLY Unfortunately not. The matter was discussed in a private testing area and as such, is still under Apple's NDA. But, I'm sure Apple will document the feature soon enough. <comment130525> @FLY, open Help Center, search for "open an app from an unidentified developer". This method is listed there.
