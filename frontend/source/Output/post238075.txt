FileVault won't login <body> The login password is entered correctly. The progress bar starts to load and gets all the way to the end, but nothing happens.  I did not turn on FileVault, just turned on my MacBook one day and this happened.   I'm using a 17" Macbook Pro.  <comment291823> Welcome to Ask Different. Did you ever enable FileVault in System Preferences? <comment291826> No, turn on laptop one day and needing to login to FileVault. <comment291835> Restart your computer and try your Apple ID password. Sometimes, FileVault uses the same password that your iCloud account uses by default.
