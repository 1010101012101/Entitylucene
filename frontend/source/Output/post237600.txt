OpenSSL encryption method doesn't work on El Capitan <body> The following file encryption method works on OS X Yosemite:    Encrypt: codeopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.zip -out file.zip.enc/code  Decrypt: codeopenssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file.zip.enc -out file.zip/code  However, when on OS X El Capitan I get this error:  precodeunknown option '-aes-256-cbc -in file.enc' /code/pre  Any solutions?  <answer237617> You likely have a shell quoting problem. The command works just fine for me in 10.11.4:  precode&gt; which openssl /usr/bin/openssl  &gt; openssl version OpenSSL 0.9.8zh 14 Jan 2016  &gt; openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in file.zip -out file.zip.enc; echo $? enter aes-256-cbc encryption password: Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password: 0  &gt; openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in file.zip.enc -out file.zip; echo $? enter aes-256-cbc decryption password: 0 /code/pre  Check to make sure that your calling program is treating code-aes-256-cbc/code as a single option and isn't quoting it when sending it in to the shell. It looks like it's calling the program with option cluster code"-aes-256-cbc -in file.enc"/code which actually isn't a valid, single option for codeopenssl/code.  If you can provide more details about how you're calling codeopenssl/code I can give you more specific guidance.  <comment291730> It worked. You are right. There is nothing inherently wrong with the method, except that my program was treating "-aes-256-cbc -in file.enc" as a single option for some unbeknown reason.  Thanks. Cheers. :)
