Run Python Script on any Mac computer <body> Is there a way to create an executable Python script that will be able to run on any Mac via terminal, similar to a Bash script. I need any user to be able to just double click the file, and it should run. I want it to be able to run without the user having Python installed, but it has to be a Python script as it has to interact with an HTML button.  <answer244101> You can use PyInstaller, which is a free program that does the exact thing you want. As the official website says:     PyInstaller is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX. Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with Python 2.7 and 3.3â€”3.5, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.   I should also mention that you can make a .py file executable just like other Linux(Unix) executable file, like this:  This command lets the file to be executed(see this)  precodeuser@linux~&gt;chmod 0755 myProg.py /code/pre  and then run it like this:  precode user@linux~&gt;./myProg.py /code/pre  <comment300753> But generally any Mac computer comes with OS X and has Python pre-installed. And isn't the requirement for CLI in Terminal a bit contradictory to "just double click"? Either is easily doable though. But you need to ask a more specific question.
