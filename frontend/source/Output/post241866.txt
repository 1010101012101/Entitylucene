How can I send emails with Mail.app as text/markdown explicitly? <body> I write all my emails in plain text, not rich text or HTML, but I do use punctuation markup as has been popularized by Markdown and others (which were inspired by prior customs in plain-text email). There’s RFC 7763 now, which registers the codetext/markdown/code media type with mandatory codecharset/code and optional codevariant/code parameters.  Can I change Apple Mail to always send a respective MIME header?  precodeContent-Type: text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=pandoc; extensions=-raw_html /code/pre  I hope for some codedefaults write/code magic since there doesn’t seem to be a respective plugin available (yet).  <answer271765> Would Brett Terpstra’s Markdown Service Tools provide what you need? Here's a nice blog-post explaining how to it up and running, also en Mail.  <comment299413> Are you aware of any mail client which does this already?  Or any mail client which renders rich text when it receives a message with such a header? <comment299575> @TomGewecke Not really. [MailMate](https://blog.freron.com/category/feature/) and [Groups.io](http://groups.io) support `Content-Type: text/plain; markup=markdown"`, though, which would need the same kind of hackery in Mail.app. I’ve filed a [feature request to Apple](http://www.apple.com/feedback/mail.html) and will do so for Thunderbird. <comment341614> No, not at all. These macros are helful for writing and converting Markdown, but do nothing to alter the format Mail is using. <comment341650> My bad. Guess I misunderstood your question.
