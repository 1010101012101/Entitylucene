DMG password protection under Mavericks <body> Under Snow Leopard I applied password protection to some archives on a Flash drive. Upgrading to Lion and later Mountain Lion did not affect that protection, but Mavericks strips it from some (not all) of these images. Plus, the Images menu in Disk Utility no longer includes the "Change Passwordâ€¦" item. Any suggestions, please?  <answer120729> Under Mavericks, if you want to change the password, you need to convert the volume.   Your problem with the passwords is probably that they might stored in your keychain, therefore it won't ask you for it on your computer.   You can remove the stored password in the codeKeychain Access.app/code.   <answer146025> In Mavericks:  ol liOpen Disk Utility (normally found under Applications - Utilities)/li liSelect the appropriate disk image from the left-hand menu/li liGo to File - Change Password/li liCreate a new password/li /ol
