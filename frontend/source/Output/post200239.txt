How to rename (main) hard disk back to default? And is the disk default really LVG? <body> I recently reinstalled OS X, when it asked me to erase the disk I just left it Untitled, since there's no instruction to rename it to whatever on this Apple support page, after restoring with Time Machine the disk name became Untitled, same with the partitioned name, which I easily rename to Macintosh HD.  Here are screenshots of the Untitled HD  img src="https://i.imgur.com/GL6B2JYh.jpg" alt="1" img src="https://i.imgur.com/I4G0S0vh.jpg" alt="2"   specs: MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014) - 256GB  AFAIR the original name has something to do with the capacity and SSD brand. Now I can't remember the original disk name and I don't know how to (safely) rename it,   To add up, I think my old disk is GUID, not LVG, did I do something wrong? strongHow can I revert back everything to the default state/strong, I'm quite anal about these things since it might results in problems in the future etc.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!  <answer200253> The naming scheme for non-CoreStorage devices/volumes looks like this:  ul li(hard-coded) name of the disk device  ul liEFI (invisible in non-tweaked Disk Utility)/li liVolume 1 (usually Macintosh HD)/li liVolume 2 (optional)/li li... (optional further volumes)/li liRecovery HD (invisible)/li /ul/li /ul  And the naming scheme for CoreStorage devices/volumes looks like this (a Fusion-disk has an additional invisible EFI partition, an invisible Boot OS X volume and a second invisible Physical Volume):  ul liname of the Logical Volume Group  ul liEFI (invisible)/li liname of Logical Volume 1 (usually Macintosh HD)/li liname of Logical Volume 2 (optional)/li li... (optional further volumes)/li liname of the Physical Volume (invisible)/li liRecovery HD (invisible)/li /ul/li /ul  The names of the Logical Volume Group and the Logical Volumes usually derive from former volume names or is just "Untitled" for Physical Volume(s) but the hard-coded physical device name is rarely used (I have seen it only once, probably the owner renamed it).  strongRenaming the Logical Volume Group:/strong  To rename the Logical Volume Group use:  precodediskutil cs rename lvgUUID|lvgName newName /code/pre  To get the lvgUUID just enter codediskutil cs list/code. It's the first UUID listed. Alternatively you may use the Logical Volume Name. I don't know whether this works if you have several equally named LVGs or PVs. Therefore I always prefer the UUID.  To get the previous visible disk device name open "About your Mac" - System Report - Hardware - SATA/SATA Express and search for your device.  strongReverting CoreStorage to non-CoreStorage:/strong  To revert the CoreStorage strongnon-destructively/strong to a traditional non-CoreStorage volume boot to Recovery Mode/Internet Recovery Mode or an OS X thumb drive.  Open Term√≠nal.app and enter:  precodediskutil cs list /code/pre  to get the Logical Volume UUID (usually it's the last listed) and enter:  precodediskutil cs revert lvUUID /code/pre  to convert your CoreStorage device to non-CoreStorage.  Though the command converts CS to non-CS non-destructively it's always a good advice to have a current backup of your main volume.  strongemYou mustn't do this with Fusion drives or you will destroy all your data./em/strong  <comment241231> Please add a proper link to the screenshot <comment241237> Added proper link. <comment241247> Got it, so which is prefered now; CoreStorage or a traditional non-CoreStorage? Also I saw this and this confuses me https://support.apple.com/en-ph/HT201723, do I need to make my disk GUID? Or using LVG is the new norm? I could swear my disk looks much like this before: https://i.imgur.com/oO4KTKg.jpg <comment241255> @AnotherHay You don't have to GUID your disk because it is already whether you use CS or not. GUID partition table is just a partition table standard replacing older ones. CoreStorage is some kind of LVM (Logical Volume Manager) ~ two layers above. You may use it or not. On a single disk without encryption it's almost useless. But your disk will automatically converted to CS if you enable FileVault.
