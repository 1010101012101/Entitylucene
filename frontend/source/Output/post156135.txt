Yosemite and FCP7? Compatability? <body> I wanted to know, how compatible is FCP7 with Yosemite? FCP7 is the mainstay of my business and wanted to know if I should upgrade.  Thanks,   <answer156161> RoaringApps might be the place to look.  This is the FCP7 page - http://roaringapps.com/app/final-cut-pro-7  Not enough reports to be truly certain as yet, I'd say.  I'd wait for at least 10.10.1 before moving mission-critical machines to it. I'm in pro-audio &amp; I'm letting others iron out all the bugs before I make the leap.
