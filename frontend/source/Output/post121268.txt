iPhone 4s stuck at apple logo in boot <body> My iPhone 4s 64GB was recently updated to iOS7.   The battery was completely empty so I had to charge it. However, the iPhone does not boot anymore and it's stuck at the Apple Logo.  I went to a service center and they say it's on recovery mode and I have to re-install the software, but data will be lost.  I have a lot of important data, how can I save these?  <answer129828> If it doesn't boot and the device isn't jailbroken, you can't get the data off it.  Hopefully you have an iCloud backup that you can restore to after restoring iOS (using recovery/DFU mode).  <comment141337> Didn't you ever make a backup before? <comment141431> If the iPhone won't show up in iTunes on your own machine your data is gone. However did you tried a hard reset by holding power + home?
