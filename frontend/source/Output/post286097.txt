Unable to change decimal seperator <body> I have an annoying issue with an ipad where a decimal value in my web app is automatically being formatted with a comma (code,/code) rather than a full stop (code./code).  I tried following this answer, but when I check under emRegion and Language Settings/em, there is no emAdvanced/em option available.  I checked here after googling what happened to this area, but looks like I need to enter something in a terminal, which this ipad does not seem to have.  Apologies if I'm missing something - I don't have much experience with Apple products. Any help is much appreciated!  strongNote/strong I am able to change this by changing my entire region to (e.g.) emUnited Kingdom/em, but this also changes other things (like adds a comma thousand seperator where I don't want one).
