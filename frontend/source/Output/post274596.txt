Is it safe to delete weird partitions on a used 2010 Mac Mini? <body> I bought a used 2010 Mac Mini Server (4,1 - intel Core 2 Duo - A1347) off ebay, and I wanted to completely wipe it and install afresh.  I upgraded from 10.6.8 Snow Leopard to 10.11.6 El Capitan first, so that I could use the internet recovery stuff etc.  when I went into Disk Utility, it showed me 2 disks and 2 volumes under the 'internal' pane.  My questions are:  ol liAre all of these partitions legit?/li liWhy do all of the tiny ones exist?/li liHow can there be 2 partitions, each 500GB, when the disk is only 500GB in size?/li liHow many of these partitions can I safely delete?/li /ol  I couldn't find any answers on the internet after an hour's research..!  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Hztz.jpg" alt="diskutil list" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DIsCt.jpg" alt="partition names"  <comment345293> I think all these extra partitions are mounted disk images. If you eject these disk images, the extra small partitions should disappear. You can do this from Terminal with `diskutil unmount /dev/disk15`, etc. The system should tell you if the images are in use. <comment345308> Your answer to question number 3: You don't have 1 500GB drive, you have 2. Look at the list closely. The first set is /dev/disk0 (internal, physical, 500GB), the second disk is /dev/disk1 (internal, physical, 500GB).
