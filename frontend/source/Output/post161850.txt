How can I connect to ftp server in terminal? <body> How can I connect to ftp server in terminal? What is the command? For example for the ssh server:  precodessh admin@ip.of.the.site /code/pre  <answer161853> pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeftp open ftp://username:password@hostname /code/pre  These are two separate commands. The open command is run within ftp.  <answer162043> precodeftp hostname /code/pre  or  precodeftp://username:password@hostname /code/pre  Now, once connected the 5 most common options are:  precodecd foldername      #e.g. cd /downloads/recent get filename       #e.g. get thisisthefileiwant.text put filename       #e.g. put sendthistotheserver.txt mget filenameregex #e.g mget * to get every file in a directory mput filemameregex #e.g. mput *.txt to upload every txt file to the server /code/pre  The only trickery is sometimes you might need to put it into binary mode by typing binary  To exit, type bye  The difference between mine and @grgarside 's solution is his forks it to the Finder using open, while mine uses Terminal  <comment189076> @blackcornail Edited to clarify <comment189077> User = name of one user of cp, password = passwd of this user, and hostname = ip address of computer where I would like to connect? <comment189101> @blackcornail Yes, this is true <comment318383> Where it downloaded the file when we use `get` command? <comment318697> @Omer It will download to wherever the command.is invoced from, so generally cd to where you want to put it first.  There is also a command lcd which may work...lcd changes the local directory path vs cd which changes the remote directory.  lcd depending on the ftp version is sometimes flakey, so, the best bet is to cd to where you'd like it first, then use ftp <comment318704> Thanks .... can I put a whole folder from local to remote ? <comment320189> @Omer Yes, and no..you'll have to do a mkdir, cd  to the directory, then mput * -- ftp is limited in that way.  See the related questions using curl (and maybe wget, but, don't quote me on it), if you'd want to do it in one step.  Note: mput * will try to move every file in the directory, if you want to be more selective, you can do *.suffix or a file name <comment320190> Also, if you're going to try to transfer lots of files, set the options so you don't need to confirm every transfer
