Buying AppleCare for a macbook from a country where it is not officially supported <body> A number of sources confirm that AppleCare can be bought any time during warranty and even in a different country. In my country (South Africa) apple care is not officially supported, the resellers here say that you have to buy emtheir/em warranty that only covers you locally. However, I plan to travel with my macbook.  Would an istore elsewhere in the world would turn down my request to buy apple care or refuse to honour it specifically because I bought my macbook in a country that does not "have" applecare? I even hear of people buying applecare on Amazon, could I buy online while I'm still in my own country?
