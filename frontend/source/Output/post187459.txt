How to delete an iOS app you can't find in springboard? <body> I have way too many apps on my phone, so many that I can't find any given app in the folders and pages of the springboard home screen any more.   If I can't find it, how do I delete it?  I don't want to use iTunes for this if there's any way at all to avoid it.   <answer187606> Oops, found it.  Settings / General / Usage / Manage Storage / app / Delete App.
