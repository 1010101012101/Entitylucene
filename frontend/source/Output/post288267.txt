Stoping the iCloud attack <body> I never thought I would say this but I am starting to hate this company. In the past year I have an attack from Apple on my iCloud.  First I had the basic plan, then they bothered me everyday to strongupgrade/strong, I did. Now, I exceeded the amount of space , and this is what happens:  ol liEvery morning, my Mac starts with a message to strongupgrade/strong the iCloud, and force me to go into a window to do so or manage my space. Leave my mac alone !/li liI get 2 emails a week from iCloud to strongupgrade/strong, emwithout/em subscription option./li liI get messages on my iPhone to strongupgrade/strong once a week./li liI get message on my iPad twice a week to strongupgrade/strong./li /ol  strongHow do I cancel these messages?/strong  Is it legal to garbage me everyday with these messages?  <answer288283> To answer both of your questions:     How do I cancel this attack?   and      Is it legal to garbage me everyday with these messages?   strongIt's not an "attack" and it's perfectly legal since you agreed to it./strong  Apple is fully within their rights to send you emcommunications/em letting you know (generally speaking) the status of your account.    When you completed the service activation for your iCloud account, you electronically agreed to the Terms and Conditions (you know that "legal" box nobody reads and just reflexively says "yes" to just so they can continue on with the installation?) you gave Apple the emlegal/em authority to contact you about your service if/when you exceed your storage limit; which you did.  From the iCloud Terms and Conditions page     We may contact you via email regarding your account, for reasons   including, strongwithout limitation, reaching or exceeding your storage   limit./strong   (emphasis mine)  Right there, it says that if Apple wanted to send you an email every minute of every day, they could and would be legally indemnified from doing so because you agreed to this condition.  strongYour options/strong  ul liDeactive your iCloud Account/li liBuy more storage/li liDelete some files/li /ul  Short of that advice, there's no circumventing this.  <comment364032> [Manage your iCloud storage](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204247): If you reach or exceed your iCloud storage limit, **learn how to manage your storage** and where you can buy more. <comment364065> I've cleared out most of the comments.
