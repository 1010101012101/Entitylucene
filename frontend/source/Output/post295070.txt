Macro software on iPad <body> I wanna have a background software than can press a certain spot when the notification appears immediately. Is there any app that can do that? Or can I manually write an app and execute it on my iPad?  <answer295536> No it is not possible. Due to sandbox restrictions built in iOS.   Even if you develop your own app you can only press a certain spot in your own app. You don't have any access to other apps or the system itself.  <comment372467> You might want to try softwarerecs.stackexchange.com
