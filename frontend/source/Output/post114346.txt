How to run an AppleScript whenever a VNC connection is established? <body> I want to run a script whenever any user connects remotely to my Mac.  I've Googled a bit about it but no perfect tutorial is there. I am less comfortable working with OS X.  <comment134009> If some file is changed on login (is there a VNC log file ?) It could be watch be the LaunchAgents and when change it could run the script ! <comment134013> I think [this question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15945/application-to-notify-user-of-active-vnc-connection) is quite similar and has already been answered.
