How to set the iphone mail app to send email only <body> I use my gmail as my primary email address and use the gmail app on my iphone.  However, whenever I want to send a picture quickly from my camera roll it uses the default mail app and then proceeds to download all the emails it perceives as unread.  All this mail is already in my gmail app,filed to read as I like.  Is there any way to set the ios mail to send only?  Thanks   <answer146048> You can setup iOS to send only, you just have to fool it :)  Here is how I did it on iOS 7...  ul liIf you have an existing GMail account setup in iPhone Mail, delete it./li liGo to Settings  Mail, Contacts...  Add Account/li liFrom the list of choices, select strongOther/strong/li liSelect strongAdd Mail Account/strong/li liFill in your details for your mail account, press strongNext/strong/li liChoose strongPOP/strong instead of IMAP/li liFor Incoming Mail Server I used dummy info like ul liServer: blah.gmail.com/li liUser Name: blah/li /ul/li liFor Outgoing Mail Server I used the proper settings ul liHost Name: smtp.gmail.com/li liUser Name: /li liPassword: /li /ul/li liPress strongSave/strong ul liIf it asks to save without SSL answer with NO/li /ul/li liPress strongSave/strong again! ul liIt will warn you that it may not work. Confirm save./li /ul/li liGo to Settings  Mail,Contacts,...  'your account'  SMTP  Primary Server/li liVerify SSL is on/li liChange Server Port to 587/li liPress strongDone/strong and exit to Accounts./li /ul  That is it! You can now send emails and if you open the mail app it will complain because of the dummy Incoming Server.  Also check that you have the Settings  Mail,Contacts.... Fetch New Data settings to off/manual.  Hope that helped.  <answer267425> The good answer by Vic above almost did it for me, but it made me realize there is this method too, which disables incoming mail by using the disallowed non-ssl:  ol liAdd your gmail account as per normal if needed./li liGo to Mail in Settings, to your Account, then Advanced and finally switch strongoff/strong codeUse SSL/code under INCOMING SETTINGS./li /ol  This cancels the ability for normal mail fetching to happen. You will have to press Done/Save again after the error pops up about imap not working etc  <comment235272> Smart tip. Although I find iOS Mail alerts (when it can't connect to a mail server) simply maddening. I wish you could turn them off. <comment335542> For it to work for me, I had to go to my gmail settings and then set it to allow insecure clients: "Google will continue to block sign-in attempts from the app you're using because it has known security problems or is out of date. You can continue to use this app by allowing access to less secure apps, but this may leave your account vulnerable." at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
