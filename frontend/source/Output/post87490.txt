How to "not reject" an incoming call during do not disturb? <body> The emDo Not Disturb/em feature in iOS 6 is great but i really dont like the part where it rejects the incoming call. Is it possible to just let it ring (without notification or sound)?  Is there a tweak in cydia that can change the way emDo Not Disturb/em behaves? I have suspended using this feature because many people confuse this with me not wanting to pick up their call (rejecting).  <answer87502> No jailbreak needed, just set the option found in strongPreferences/Notifications/Do Not Disturb/Allow calls from/strong to strongEveryone/strong.  <answer290991> You can already silence incoming calls without rejecting them by turning on the strongMute/strong switch on the side of your iPhone. Then go into strongSettings/strong → strongSounds &amp; Haptics/strong and emDisable/em codeVibrate on Silent/code.  You can combine this with strongDo Not Disturb/strong by allowing calls from codeEveryone/code under strongSettings/strong → strongDo Not Disturb/strong.  You will still get the Incoming Call screen, as the only way to make it go away is to either accept or reject the call (from a UI perspective, there’s no reason to have a call ring that you cannot accept). However if you’re not using your iPhone at that time then this achieves your purpose of letting your callers go to voicemail “naturally,” rather than after one ring.  <comment102257> This may be a workaround. Perhaps the OP wants to not hear calls (the way it is normally with DND - no vibration or audible alerts), but, like he said, let them ring? <comment102310> Thanks bassplayer, you hit the nail on the head. I exactly want that ! <comment102389> It appears that RingerX VIP has a feature that, although not exactly fitting your request, might be helpful: http://cydiablog.gdnainc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/RingerX-VIP-2.png <comment102727> Would you kindly mark Ryccardo's post as an answer since you have accepted his response?
