How can I eject a Time Machine drive quickly? <body> I have a Time Machine drive for my laptop...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M8reR.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I bring the machine to work. Every morning I right-click "Eject" the drive, and it takes forever or just doesn't eject.  I'm in a hurry, so I either codesudo /sbin/shutdown -h now/code or if I'm really in a rush just yank the drive (then get scolded by the OS when I log back in later).  What would be a better way?  hr  MacBook Pro mid 2012 ; OS 10.12.1 (Sierra)  <answer264455> Maybe too much data to backup. reduce your time machine backup to an interval smaller than 4 hours, if the unmount is slow it is because the backup has too much to backup, or that your antivirus slows it a lot. therefore, if there is less to backup before ejection the unmounting should be quicker. Do not also forget to check monthly if your disk transfert rate become too slow, (copy a big file and count the time) . very long disk access are a sign for a forthcoming disk failure...  <comment331203> Does `diskutil unmount "/Volumes/NameOfDisk"` work? <comment331402> http://osxdaily.com/2012/02/02/change-the-time-machine-backup-schedule/
