Unable to disconnect from iPhone Personal Hotspot <body> I can connect to my iPhone hotspot through Wi-Fi on my MacBook Air, but when I then click strong"Disconnect from my iPhone"/strong in the strongWi-Fi/strong menu, nothing happens.  The only method I could use disconnect is to disable Personal Hotspot on the iPhone itself.   Disconnecting on my MacBook used to work prior to upgrading to OS X 10.11, El Capitan. Any idea of a fix?  <answer213113> I solved my problem following bmike's instructions: I rebooted my computer!  <answer245006> My solution is to "Turn Wi-Fi off" and the enable it again, on the MacBook. Kinda hassle but it solved my issue.  <comment257221> Hmm - sounds like a temporary block. Is this reproducible after you reboot your Mac? <comment257224> I have this same problem, although I'm not sure how to fix it beside disconnecting the hotspot from the source. (i.e. iphone,etc.) <comment257307> Thanks bmike, rebooting the Mac solved the problem. <comment302008> Welcome to Ask Different.  We like answers to be more than just a single line.

So I always turn off wifi for a while on my mac. So far I have not found a better solution <comment302053> Actually, this did not help on the long term. I ended up turning off wifi on my mac for a while when I want to disconnect. <comment303771> following this answer clearly resolves the problem.
