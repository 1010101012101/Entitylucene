Using my Dads music on my iPhone? <body> When my Dad died last year we put his iphone away in a drawer for safe keeping, because his music was very important to him and obviously we didn't want to lose it.  The phone is getting hard to hold a charge now and I'm wondering if there is a way to put his music into my iPhone? I bought a 64gig iPhone to have enough room to fit it all on but now I've realised it isn't as easy as I first thought.  Is there a way to do this or do I just have to hope the battery never completely fails on his phone?  <answer224615> There is no 'official' way to pull music from any iDevice back to a computer, but there are many unofficial apps that can do it.  The basic idea is that you get the music off the iDevice &amp; into iTunes, from where you can then keep it or re-sync it to your own device.  I know of no way to do this directly from phone to phone, you must have a computer as an intermediary.  Googling "copy music from iPhone to computer" will give you more variants on applications than you would know what to do with - &amp; also I don't know what computer platform you have, so I'm linking to a LifeHacker article explaining how to do it on Windows, Mac &amp; Linux.
