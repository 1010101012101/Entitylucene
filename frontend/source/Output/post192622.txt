problems installing homebrew on mavericks <body> I tried to install homebrew (OSX 10.9.5) using the recommended  precoderuby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" /code/pre  but got  precodeIllegal variable name. /code/pre  I do have macports installed, so perhaps some commands do not what they are meant to?? But note that ruby is /usr/bin/ruby and curl is /usr/bin/curl.  How can I overcome this problem?  <answer192624> The problem lies with usage of codetcsh/code as underlying shell. codetcsh/code does not support code$()/code as a syntax for command substituion. When using codebash/code instead, it works just fine.  <answer219223> in terminal preferences, change /bin/tcsh to /bin/bash  <comment331001> Presumably the OP is using `tcsh` because they want to use it in preference to `bash`! They don't need to (semi)permanently change their shell - just drop into `bash` to install `brew`, then exit `bash` and return to `tcsh`. And that'll work even if they're using iTerm2, or another terminal emulator, not just Terminal.app.
