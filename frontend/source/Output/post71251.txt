Apple Aperture Tutorial <body> I am looking for a good Aperture tutorial and would appreciate some recommendations.  Which tutorials can you recommend?  <answer71255> You could start with Apple's free training videos at Aperture 3 video tutorials. Also see the list of Aperture training resources and general Aperture resources (including downloads, extras and training).  There are other paid video tutorials from VTC, Lynda, Kelby Training, etc.
