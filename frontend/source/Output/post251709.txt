Error when creating OS X installer on USB drive via Terminal <body> Hi I'm getting this error when I paste into the Terminal  precodesudo: /Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia: command not found /code/pre  What am I doing wrong?  <answer251710> It means that the path "/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia" doesn't exist. emcreateinstallmedia/em is an executable to create bootable El Capitan installer media. You either moved/renamed "Install OS X El Capitan.app" (or the file createinstallmedia) or it doesn't exist at all.  <answer251743> It would be easier to use DiskMaker X, a free app, with which you create a bootable USB stick from the installer file without having to use Terminal. I've used it since Mac OS X Lion 10.7, when Apple first went to a download-only model and never had a problem with it.  <comment312928> sudo: & createinstallmedia: with colons... Is that OK? <comment313002> @Tetsujin He's pasting the error message, which is coming from sudo ("sudo:" meaning "sudo returned") and the second colon meaning, "the following relates to the text before the colon". He didn't type it in that way.
