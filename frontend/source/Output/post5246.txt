iPhone app to point me back to a waypoint (like a computer game) <body> I'm looking for an app which I can use to find my camper in the desert after going for a walk, or find the b&amp;b i left my bags in after exploring a new city. I'm hoping for something really simple which just points in the right direction and perhaps tells me a distance, like your next target on a computer game. I'm imagining opening a compass and clicking a button to record a place then having a needle pointing north and another arrow point back to the waypoint.  Does this exist?  <answer5248> Motion-X GPS Lite is free, and lets you set waypoints and navigate back to them.  Reviewed here.  ol liTap Menu  Waypoints to save or select a waypoint /li liTap Menu  Compass to see the heading/li /ol  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/exjIw.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer5249> Beacon does exactly this and is free.  <comment5419> That's funny because I had the EXACT same idea, and I started developing an app just like that, which doesn't have the bloated features of a full-fledged GPS app like MotionX GPS. <comment272758> This is no longer free. <comment272759> This no longer exists.
