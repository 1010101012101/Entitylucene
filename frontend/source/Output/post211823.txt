How can I force my iPhone to download optimized size photos (not just thumbnails) <body> I have plenty of free space on my iPhone but not enough to download all originals of my entire iCloud photo library. Therefore I chose "Optimise iPhone Storage". However, instead of using the free space on the iPhone and downloading all photos in optimized size, it downloads the low resolution thumbnails. It only downloads a higher resolution photo (appropriate to the size of the iPhone display) when I individually click the thumbnail.  Is there a way to force the iPhone to download (at once, when connected through Wifi) all my iCloud library photos in optimized size? (instead of the orginals, for which I do not have enough space, or the thumbnails, which do not have sufficient quality for normal viewing on the iPhone)  Thanks.
