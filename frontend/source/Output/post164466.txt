How to synchronize contents of two external drives? <body> I have two external hard drives (ExFAT formatted) which I need to keep in sync.  Specifically, drive B must mirror the contents of drive A and drive A must not be modified.  How can I do this without having to do a emfull/em copy of drive contents every time?  I'm on OS X 10.10.  This is simply for periodically backing up the contents of drive A.  <answer164482> You could use codersync/code like this:  precodersync -av --delete /Volumes/DiskA/ /Volumes/DiskB /code/pre  code--delete/code option is for delete files in DiskB that was previously deleted on DiskA.  If you want to schedule it to execute periodically, I suggest you to read How can I run/stop/relaunch an application automatically, at boot/login/some other time?.  <answer164484> codersync/code is certainly one way to go. The other is to use something like SuperDuper or CarbonCopyCloner which can do drive cloning/mirroring. Also, ChronoSync might be an option as well, if you need to keep track of deleted contents for any reason.  <answer164516> I use DropSync and have done for ages - does what you need and more and costs $16 from the developer or $19.99 from the Mac App Store.  http://www.mudflatsoftware.com/  <comment192805> Not sure if you want to invest in a nas, but I use a synology DS214+ nas with 2 drives in it. One drive is a backup of the other. Raid. <comment192806> @Jules - a RAID is not a backup <comment192807> @Jules Thanks, but I'm only looking for software solutions now. <comment192820> @Szabolcs Do you already use Time Machine to backup your Mac? <comment192845> I was under the impression that rsync can't delete files.  It seem that's not correct then.  I don't need (or want) to schedule it, as the disks are not always connected.  I can run it manually. <comment192847> Easier, just execute the command when you need to, and you are done. <comment192851> Shouldn't that be `/Volumes/DiskA/` instead of `/Volumes/DiskA`?  I tested it on a small folder and it creates the folder name of the source in the destination otherwise. <comment192852> You are right. My mistake. <comment192895> $8 is much more reasonable than the price of the other tools mentioned and I do prefer a graphical tool to typing in rsync commands (which carry a risk of making a typo as small as leaving off a `/` and completely messing up the harddrives).  Does it support deleting files in the destination directory? <comment193049> @Szabolcs Yes it does, I use it to keep an exact copy of folders from my hard drive over an ethernet connection to my wife's computer. If I delete files then sync they are deleted on her computer as well. You also get a preview of what files will be copied and which ones will be deleted before you commit to it.
