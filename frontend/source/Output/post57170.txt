Launch Final Cut Pro, make a new project and name it with Automator <body> I want to make an Automator app that will do a couple of things for me with Final Cut Pro:  ol liI want it to ask me to name a the new project (we will call it emtest1/em)/li liThen I want it to make a new folder and name it emtest1/em/li liThen I want it to launch Final Cut Pro and make a new project and name it emtest1/em/li /ol  This is what I have accomplished so far:  ol liRun AppleScript  precodeon run {foldername, parameters}     display dialog "Please choose name" default answer "untitled"     set foldername to text returned of result     return foldername end run /code/pre/li liSet Value of Variable foldername/li liNew Folder foldername/li liRun AppleScript  precodeon run {input, parameters} application "Final Cut Pro" end run /code/pre/li /ol  I just canâ€™t find any script on how to create a new project, let alone name it.  <answer57185> I don't have any version of Final Cut, but from the MacScripter search results it appears like at least the older versions weren't scriptable. Anyway, have you looked at its AppleScript dictionary (by e.g. dropping its icon on AppleScript Editor)?  Would it be possible to just copy a template file instead of creating a new project? If so, if you saved a script like this as code/usr/bin/fcpp/code and ran codechmod +x /usr/bin/fcpp/code, you could create a new project with codefcpp Project name/code.  precode#!/bin/bash  mkdir -p ~/Projects/"$*" cp -r ~/Documents/Test.fcpx ~/"Projects/$*/$*.fcpx" open ~/"Projects/$*/$*.fcpx" /code/pre  <answer98665> I'm no coder, but maybe you could do it at the finder level. Duplicate a blank project file, and rename it the input of your dialog box before opening it?
