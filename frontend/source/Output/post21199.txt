Desktop clean up function - Control, Command 1 – is not working after I installed Lion? Other keyboard shortcuts are working, as far as I can tell <body> What I thought was a universal keyboard shortcut (kbdctrl/kbd+kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd1/kbd) to cleanup and arrange my desktop, no longer works after I installed Lion. I can go up to the view drop down menu and click on it and it works but I like to use my commands. What can I do about this?  <answer21237> The keyboard command appears to be kbd⌘/kbd+kbd&#x2325;/kbd+kbd1/kbd to clean up by name now.
