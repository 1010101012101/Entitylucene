How can I tell Firewall to allow incoming connections for Python.app running Django <body> Each time I run my Django development server, I get a dialog to allow incoming connections.  No matter what I do :  ul liClick Allow in the dialog box/li liAdd to the Firewall via the OS X GUI (both real and venv python executables are allowed, and also the Python.app/li liSelf-sign the executable (see http://darklaunch.com/2014/02/02/fix-do-you-want-the-application-python-to-accept-incoming-network-connections)/li /ul  OS X still systematically ask me to allow incoming connection.  It's not just annoying, it's impossible to work with my IDE which restart the dev server after each code change.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EOIXJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  I have to either turn off the firewall, or change my IDE configuration, both are bad solutions.  strongHow can I permanently add the script in my firewall allowed apps?/strong  I'm running Maverick 10.9.4  <answer142037> You can manually configure the firewall to unblock a port (i.e. 8080).  You'll need to open code/etc/pf.conf/code in a text editor and add:  codepass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080/code  to the end of the file (for port 8080, adjust to suit your needs).  Then restart your computer.  If that doesn't work run:  $ codesudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf/code  to see if you get an error. If so fix.  Then restart again.  Should work.  <answer171354> Signing the python application, using the instruction in the answer to this question, worked for me.  <comment169804> I added `pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8000` to  `/etc/pf.conf` and restarted. Nothing changed. I don't see any error when using `pfctl`. <comment169829> What IDE are you using? It seems from you original message that it is play an integral part of this equation. <comment169907> I am using `PyCharm Professional Edition`
