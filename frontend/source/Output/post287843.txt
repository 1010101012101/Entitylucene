How to raise the brightness on a computer using terminal <body> How would I raise the brightness on my computer using terminal? Ideally, it would be done without executing an apple script or downloading external software, but whatever works. Thanks!  <answer287845> Install strongHomebrew/strong. (Bonus points for already having it installed)  Once that's all well and good, enter codebrew install brightness/code  Now, all you have to do is type in codebrightness &lt;level&gt;/code to change your laptop's brightness. Change codelevel/code to your desired brightness on a scale of 0 to 1.  (example: enter codebrightness .27/code for 27% brightness)  hr  Some bonus tips:  ul lientering codebrightness -lv/code will print some detailed info about your display, as well as your brightness level./li licodebrightness -l/code will give you emsome/em information about your display, but considerably less than code-lv/code. It still prints your current brightness./li liThe project is strongopen-source on GitHub/strong. Kudos to @nriley for making this project./li /ul  <comment363457> My MacBook is currently not working, so I can't look up the name of the setting, but it can be done with 'defaults write'. Homebrew is nice, but not necessary. <comment363459> @WGroleau it's simply the easiest and cleanest way to do this. <comment363505> Perhaps.  But "Ideally â€¦ without downloading" implies the OP would disagree.  I would think that identifying the correct keyword for something that comes with the O.S. would be no more difficult than installing homebrew then running it to install brightness.  I've used brew to install other things, and at least once it made me do something else first. <comment363519> @WGroleau oops, missed that. home brew shouldn't require anything else for this script, it runs on my mac.
