Hidden files taking up hard disc space? <body> I’ve used DaisyDisk to analyse my file usage on my MacBook Pro (mid–2012), but the numbers aren’t adding up. Of 500GB, it shows ~425GB used, but the breakdown only adds up to 280GB. The diagram itself shows a big gap, so what’s going on? What else can I use to track down this drive usage? I’ve attached a screen grab of my DaisyDisk analysis.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o6Dg9.png" alt="Screengrab of DaisyDisk analysis"  Using the Disk utility and the Storage tab from emAbout this Mac/em doesn’t reveal anything useful either, see following screen grabs:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y5Wsy.png" alt="Screen grab from About this Mac"  <comment271642> One of these answer might help you: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/44877/gigabytes-of-disk-space-shown-as-hidden-space-in-daisydisk <comment271658> Are you running DaisyDisk as an admin user? If not, see if the results are different when you do. <comment271691> The existence of the `lost+found` directory indicates an issue with your file system. Back-up your hard drive and run disk utility from the Recovery partition or run fsck in single user mode. <comment271735> Thanks everyone, @Joonas’ lead got me to the right place. Doing a scan as an admin helped, but it wasn’t apparent that was possible as I was using a version of the app downloaded from the Mac App Store. For anyone reading this later, the developers have made it easy to switch to a version from their own site that permits scanning the entire Mac HD as an admin.
