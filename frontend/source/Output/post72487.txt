I accidentally moved a locked file out of it's proper place. [Macbook] <body> I accidentally moved this picture file called "048AE10.png" (it's a picture of a 'X') into my Directory in Finder. I forgot how I moved it there, or where did I find it... I cant remove it from my directory now since it's locked, and even if I could, I dont know where to return it. :/ [I believe this is the reason my my minecraft mods wont work]  <comment84285> I couldn't find that file on my Mac (OS X 10.8.2), maybe because I don't have Minecraft installed... Let's wait for another Minecraft fan to chime in, in the meanwhile you may add it as a tag or edit the title of the question to mention it (if that's possible).
