How can I make my iChat to connect again to chat server when I wake my Mac? <body> Currently, my iChat does not recover my status when Mac is waken from sleeping. It keeps being offline. How can I make it connect to server automatically when my Mac waken?  <answer11588> What version of iChat do you have? When I close my computer (thus putting it to sleep), and then reopen it, after 15 seconds or so, it reconnects. I have v5.0.3.  Check to see if you have that version, or whatever the newest version is. If that doesn't help, try reinstalling the program.  <answer13697> The iChat plugin Chax will let you do this.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ebGOp.png" alt="Chax preferences"  <comment12132> Mine is also `Version 5.0.3 (745)`. How can I reinstall iChat? Should I reinstall whole OS again?
