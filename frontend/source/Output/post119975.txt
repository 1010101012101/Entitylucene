Keep wi-fi connection while asleep? <body> Right now my MacBook Pro is set to go to sleep after 1 hour and then when I wake it back up, I have to wait for it to find/connect to Wi-Fi again.  How can I maintain the Wi-Fi connection so when I wake the computer, it's already connected?  I'm running OS X 10.9.1 on a Retina MacBook Pro.  Here are my Energy Saver preferences:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8E27.png" alt="Energy Saver Preferences"  <answer119979> If your Mac enters its full sleep state, then your network connections will be disconnected. Your Mac can not be connected to a WiFi network and be asleep at the same time.  You can avoid full sleep by setting your strongComputer Sleep/strong to strongNever/strong. Your MacBook will then sleep all the sub-systems possible when idle, but will remain awake enough to maintain a WiFi network connection.  PowerNap is not the same as full sleep. This is a special state controlled by Apple and, for now, available only to Apple's chosen processes.  <answer126956> See where System Preferences - Energy Saver says:  Wake for Network Access?  If your mac is asleep it can still be accessed via Wi-Fi, and woken up.  Power Nap wakes up and connects to services and then disconnects, going into  Bonjour Sleep Proxy mode for being woken up again via Wi-Fi.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5963  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3774  One thing to note tho, when Power Nap "wakes up" for the brief moment, the screen does not wake up...  <comment148729> This doesn't sound like a solid answer, if you "believe" it. <comment148881> I got rid of the, I believe, pause, because I don't know everything that goes on, but really a -1? wow, so yeah kinda from what I read I could seriously say "I believe" but I don't understand how can with 100% certainty give a guarantee of anything, anything dude... oh well "The sun will come out tomorrow, tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow will be there, what if you die? Bye <comment148883> that -1 was not mine. <comment148886> My bad, I just need to learn to not use slang, or sargon I guess, but I don't know... seems like quick speech, quick chat, or shortcuts are everywhere, who draws these lines in the sand? <comment148887> I would say, SE is not a slang-location if I may call it that way. This is kinda a knowledge base and help for others, thus readability is important. <comment331958> I don't find *Computer Sleep* in El Capitan. <comment331970> @Volatil3 see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/188682/sleep-timeout-missing-from-the-energy-saver-preferences for more about the changed Energy Saver interface.
