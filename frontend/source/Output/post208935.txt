How to make Kindle Preview run on El Capitain <body> Installed Kindle Previewer v2.94 but it doesn't open, just crashes without even an error message.  tried to solve using this blog's instructions  but it didn't worked out.  <answer219184> I found this works  (from Apple's Java support note )  1) Download and install X11 https://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac  2) Download and install Java for OSX https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US  3) finderapplications(right click) kindle previewer.appshow package contentscontentsmacos (Right click) Launcheropen with other, choose textedit, then enter the following and save  precode#!/bin/sh  export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home"  dir=`dirname "$0"` cd "$dir" classpath=./:./lib/touchLibs/etc/fonts/fonts  for i in `ls ./lib` do classpath=$classpath:./lib/$i done  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.  # start the previewer fileExtT=`echo $1 | awk -F.

I would have thought OSX Java programs cannot use X11 (has someone just copied Linux instructions?) <comment288674> @Mark not sure, but I am following along trying to get the previewer to work on El Capitan.  I have Java 6 and Xquartz installed, then as soon as I added the JAVA_HOME bits to the first script the Amazon Kindle Previewer launched.  (I had previously tried starting it but it appeared to silently crash), so this answer seems to solve the problem. <comment288694> I suspect it just needs Java 6 and the rest is unnecessary also even crash is recorded in the logs <comment288695> I would also read the comments top the article - one says just need to use java 6 and I suspect there are easier ways - a later pone gives an Amazon released patch but no other info tho could be malware
