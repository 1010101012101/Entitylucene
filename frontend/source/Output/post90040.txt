look up a word in Dictionary.app in Terminal <body> Is there a bash or applescript to look up a word in code/Applications/Dictionary.app/code from a Terminal window ?  precodeopen -a /Applications/Dictionary.app/ --args word /code/pre  ignores --args, says "type a word to look up"  Mac Dictionary improvements suggests kbd⌃ Control/kbd kbd⌘ Command/kbd kbdD/kbd however I'm looking to launch the full app, not just the small popover.  <answer90044> You can use...  precodeopen dict://my_word /code/pre  ...which will open the Dictionary application and lookup the string codemy_word/code. If you want to use multiple words use something like codeopen dict://"Big Bang Theory"/code.  There's no output in the Terminal though.  <answer90045> I was also going to suggest codeopen dict://word/code, but Google's dictionary API also uses the New Oxford American Dictionary:  precode#!/usr/bin/env ruby  require "open-uri" require "json" require "cgi"  ARGV.each { |word|   response = open("http://www.google.com/dictionary/json?callback=dict_api.callbacks.id100&amp;q=#{CGI.escape(word)}&amp;sl=en&amp;tl=en&amp;restrict=pr,de").read   results = JSON.parse(response.sub(/dict_api.callbacks.id100\(/, "").sub(/,200,null\)$/, ""))   next unless results["primaries"]   results["primaries"][0]["entries"].select { |e| e["type"] == "meaning" }.each { |entry|     puts word + ": " + entry["terms"][0]["text"].gsub(/x3c\/?(em|i|b)x3e/, "").gsub("x27", "'")   } } /code/pre  <answer90050> Using the Python Objective-C bindings, you could create just a small python script to get it from the built in OS X Dictionary. Here's a post that details this script"  precode#!/usr/bin/python  import sys from DictionaryServices import *  def main():     try:         searchword = sys.argv[1].decode('utf-8')     except IndexError:         errmsg = 'You did not enter any terms to look up in the Dictionary.'         print errmsg         sys.exit()     wordrange = (0, len(searchword))     dictresult = DCSCopyTextDefinition(None, searchword, wordrange)     if not dictresult:         errmsg = "'%s' not found in Dictionary." % (searchword)         print errmsg.encode('utf-8')     else:         print dictresult.encode('utf-8')  if __name__ == '__main__':     main() /code/pre  Save that to codedict.py/code, and then just run codepython dict.py dictation/code  img src="https://i.imgur.com/TU7NVGx.png" alt="enter image description here"  Check out the post for more instructions on making it accessable all across your terminal.  <answer181696> I came across this post looking for a similar thing. Wasn't happy with the options available so made simple script. Its a terminal based thesaurus with text to speech.

It uses the definitions from codeDictionary.app/code.   precodedictionary cat # cat 1 |kat| ▶noun 1 a small domesticated carnivorous mammal with soft fur... /code/pre  It uses DictionaryKit, a wrapper for the private Dictionary Services available on OSX. There's interesting background information about how this works on NSHipster.  <comment105705> Instead of the "more" button you just click the dictionary's name in the pop-up to open the search in the dictionary application. <comment105707> Thanks. Is there a list of open magicprefix:... someplace  ? <comment105710> @Denis I don't know of a source that specifically collects undocumented command options for `open`. But generally speaking, http://hints.macworld.com/ is a well known source for hidden gems. I also used to know a different source which collects undocumented `defaults write` commands, but I can't remember it just know and Google did not help me either... <comment105715> Thanks everybody, [there's_more_than_one_way_to_skin_a_cat](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there's_more_than_one_way_to_skin_a_cat) <comment105800> I made a brief summary of `open` on SuperUser a while ago http://superuser.com/questions/4368/os-x-equivalent-of-windows-run-box/4383#4383 <comment106264> @denis the system maintains a database of all the prefixes that all the apps installed have told it how to handle. If you can think of a practical use for knowing that tidbit, asking a full question would be awesome. <comment210709> I used this script, but there is no line break in the output, it looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/ooAwQCA.png (on an OS X 10.9). <comment248814> I also get no newline in the output. Checking ```print repr(dictresult.encode('utf-8'))``` shows me this: ```'dictation |d\xc9\xaak\xcb\x88te\xc9\xaa\xca\x83(\xc9\x99)n| \xe2\x96\xb6noun [ mass noun ] 1 the action of dictating words to be typed, written down, or recorded on tape: the dictation of letters. \xe2\x80\xa2 the activity of taking down a passage that is dictated by a teacher as a test of spelling, writing, or language skills: passages for dictation. \xe2\x80\xa2 words that are dictated: the job will involve taking dictation, drafting ...'``` <comment259285> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment260120> I've added some string replacements to simulate line breaks.. seems to work ok although I haven't tested it extensively: https://gist.github.com/lambdamusic/bdd56b25a5f547599f7f <comment284346> This doesn't seem to work anymore. <comment286646> That Google API is deprecated and returns 404. Looks like http://www.dictionaryapi.com/ could work, just have to make a login.
