How do I add space to the logical volume group? <body> So my computer has been incredibly slow and keeps hanging whenever I try to access files the last couple days. I think I have finally tracked down the problem to my hard drive not having enough space to efficiently function.   As you can see in the screenshot it only has 19mb of free space. Could this explain why my computer is so slow? How would I go about fixing this? img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qzHEm.png" alt="enter image description here"  Info: Running OS X Yosemite 10.10.2; Mid 2012 macbook pro; my mounted hard drive is encrypted, this might have something to do with it?  <comment331376> The free space is really too small! It will help if free up some space! MacOS need disk space to operate.
