Build Mavericks-Compatible NAS for Scheduled, Wireless, Bootable Backups and Storing & Accessing Media across Local Devices <body> I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro running Mavericks (10.9.1) and an early 2008 MacBook Pro running 10.8.5.   I want to build an NAS that allows me to wirelessly and automatically backup both machines on a regular schedule, store media, have media available for watching via iPad and PS3 on my TV, and redundancy.   I am considering two options.  ol liTurning a Power Mac G4 or G5 into an NAS, by adding drives and a PCI card (which I believe is necessary)./li liUsing an old PC, adding drives and running unRAID or FreeNas. (I believe FreeNas is more Mac-friendly than unRAID, but I am still sorting this out)./li /ol  Which option would be the easiest, most Apple-friendly, allow for best future expansion, and least expensive?  <comment136734> You have several questions in here. This site works better when there is only one question per question. That way, it's easier for other people to find solutions if they have the same problem. Can you please limit down the scope of your question, you can always add additional questions separately later.
