unmounted smb disk asking for password iMac 5K, late 2014 running El capitan <body> My company as a network drive (smb) containing various application that I dont often use (MATLAB, Mathmatica, and others).  I mounted the disk without a problem, used an application (MATLAB if it matters) unmounted the disk, went home happy.  The next day and ever since, a window asking me for my credentials is waiting for me.  If I hit cancel, it comes back after a few minutes.  If I enter my password, the disk doesn't mount (though If I try, I can mount the disk without adding my password again).  I have looked under system preferences/Users and Groups the disk is not automatically mounted at login (although I should have known better, I dont logout at night). It is not in /etc/auto*.     Any ideas how to stop the pop-up?   iMac retina 5k late 2014, OS X El Capitan  <comment363953> updated to MacOS sierra.  Still a problem.  It's driving me crazy  every 5 minutes it steals my focus in mid sentence trying to get me to enter a password.
