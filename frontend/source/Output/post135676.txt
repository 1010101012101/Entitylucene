Does a good GPU increase the quality of Quicktime screen captures <body> I am on a MacBook Pro Early 2010 (Core 2 Duo, NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB) and I don't have access to a more powerful Mac to test this. I have been wondering if Quicktime screen capture supports hardware acceleration.  To make it a bit more clear: does Quicktime record to the CPU, GPU, or both.  <comment160843> You have 3 questions in here. We prefer one question one answer. <comment160916> I don't know where the third question is from but yes, I can fix that if it is absolutely necessary although both questions are highly related and I think anyone who would want this question answered would find it useful. <comment160925> Does a good GPU increase the quality of Quicktime screen captures? wondering if Quicktime screen capture supports hardware acceleration? does Quicktime record to the CPU, GPU, or both.
