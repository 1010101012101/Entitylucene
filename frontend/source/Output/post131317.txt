iTunes, even when not playing, keeping my computer from sleeping automatically <body> I'm using the default Energy Save preferences on a MBPro running Mavericks. If iTunes is running, my computer will not go to sleep automatically even if iTunes is not playing (e.g., if I stop it by pressing Command-.). I've tried all of the following without success:  ul liResetting the NVRAM as recommended here/li liResetting the SMC as recommended here/li lisudo pmset touch/li lisudo mv /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist ~kuzzooroo/Desktop/li lisudo mv /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration ~kuzzooroo/Desktop//li liReinstalling iTunes/li liRunning Disk Utility's Repair Disk Permissions feature/li /ul  Here's some codepmset/code output from while iTunes is running:  precode$ pmset -g | grep " sleep"  sleep                1 (sleep prevented by coreaudiod) $ pmset -g assertions | tail    ExternalMedia                  0    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1    NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process:    pid 198(coreaudiod): [0x0000000100000159] 00:04:37 NoIdleSleepAssertion named: "com.apple.audio.'AppleHDAEngineOutput:1B,0,1,1:0'.noidlesleep"    pid 74(hidd): [0x0000000a00000167] 00:04:23 UserIsActive named: "com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle"     Timeout will fire in 110 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease Kernel Assertions: 0xc=USB,BT-HID    id=501  level=255 0x4=USB mod=5/19/14, 21:55 description=XHC1 owner=AppleUSBXHCI    id=502  level=255 0x8=BT-HID mod=12/31/69, 19:00 description=com.apple.driver.IOBluetoothHIDDriver owner=BNBTrackpadDevice /code/pre  And here's what I see after quitting iTunes:  precode$ pmset -g | grep " sleep"  sleep                1 $ pmset -g assertions | tail    PreventSystemSleep             0    ExternalMedia                  0    PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     0    NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process:    pid 74(hidd): [0x0000000a00000167] 00:06:25 UserIsActive named: "com.apple.iohideventsystem.queue.tickle"     Timeout will fire in 104 secs Action=TimeoutActionRelease Kernel Assertions: 0xc=USB,BT-HID    id=501  level=255 0x4=USB mod=5/19/14, 21:55 description=XHC1 owner=AppleUSBXHCI    id=502  level=255 0x8=BT-HID mod=12/31/69, 19:00 description=com.apple.driver.IOBluetoothHIDDriver owner=BNBTrackpadDevice /code/pre  I usually have iTunes running and would prefer that the computer sleep even if I forget to quit iTunes (and forget to put the computer to sleep manually).  What is the next thing I should try? Thanks!  <answer135057> I called Apple and interestingly the stuff they advised me to do was nothing I'd found anywhere online. They said the issues with coreaudiod are generally caused by iTunes extensions. They had me open up Activity Monitor and advised me to kill a process called AccuBeatMix, and that made the issue go away. I've got an e-mail out to the maker of AccuBeatMix to see if there's a workaround and will post here if there is. Until then I've just got it uninstalled (moved it out of code/Library/iTunes/iTunes Plug-ins/code).  <comment154256> you have done a lots of good work already. doing the disk utility permissions repair would not harm. <comment154668> Thank you @Buscarì›ƒ. I tried Repair Permissions and unfortunately it did not solve the problem. I've updated the question to reflect that. Is there anything left to try?
