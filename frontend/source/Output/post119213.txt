How can I launch a GUI app in Applications folder from command line? <body> I would like to launch a GUI app that is in the codeApplications/code folder from the command line as opposed to clicking the icon in the codeFinder/code or in the codeDock/code.  The reason I want that is to be able to launch it as coderoot/code using codesudo/code as opposed to launching it as my default user.    When I went into the Applications, this is what it looked like:  precode/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 13 CE.app@16:16:42&gt;ls -la total 40 drwxr-xr-x@ 10 myuser  admin    340 Dec 17 14:07 . drwxrwxr-x+ 68 root           admin   2312 Jan 20 18:00 .. drwxr-xr-x@  6 myuser  admin    204 Dec 17 14:08 Contents -rw-r--r--@  1 myuser  admin  11358 Dec 17 14:06 LICENSE.txt -rw-r--r--@  1 myuser  admin    127 Dec 17 14:06 NOTICE.txt drwxr-xr-x@ 14 myuser  admin    476 Dec 17 14:09 bin -rw-r--r--@  1 myuser  admin     10 Dec 17 14:01 build.txt drwxr-xr-x@ 85 myuser  admin   2890 Dec 17 14:06 lib drwxr-xr-x@ 29 myuser  admin    986 Dec 17 14:06 license drwxr-xr-x@ 30 myuser  admin   1020 Dec 17 14:06 plugins /code/pre  Funny thing is, in the codeFinder/code, codeIntelliJ IDEA 13 CE/code shows as a clickable icon which launches the app.  But at the terminal level, it is actually a directory with contents I do not know how to navigate and manipulate to emulate a GUI click.  <answer119217> Just 'cd' into the application bundle, then into the codeContents/code folder, and then into the codeMacOS/code folder. There should be an executable file in there which you can run normally. If there are multiple executable files in there, you could look at the codeContents/Info.plist/code file inside the application bundle, and look for the entry codeCFBundleExecutable/code, which indicates the executable file that is launched when you double-click the application bundle in Finder.  <answer119218> Simply use codeopen/code:  precodeopen "/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA 13 CE.app" /code/pre    precodeopen -a "IntelliJ IDEA 13 CE" /code/pre  hr  However, prepending codesudo/code isn't enough to run as root. You'll need to run the actual binary:  precodesudo /Applications/ApplicationName.app/Contents/MacOS/ApplicationName /code/pre  <comment139047> If you use the -a flag for the `open` command you don't need the path. <comment139049> Yes, but giving the full path will always work regardless of where the app is located. Either way, I've added it. <comment139051> I didn't have to use open. <comment139052> I've never had the -a flag fail. Apps don't have to be located in /Applications for it to work. I can open stuff I've written that is buried somewhere in ~/Library/ without a problem. The only issue is if there is more than one copy of an app then I'm not sure which one will open. <comment139053> @Mark I've had trouble with -a for apps on network drives, although I suppose that is an edge case. <comment139054> I can see that, but it's not something I've ever tried. <comment139068> Just a warning that some apps don't like their executable run directly without passing them some options on the command line. Isn't there a plist somewhere that defines the options that get passed to the executable when it is run as an app? <comment139079> The Info.plist file inside the Contents directory of the App may define, e.g., environment variables that should be set. Running the executable directly will bypass this. <comment140023> Related: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/4240
