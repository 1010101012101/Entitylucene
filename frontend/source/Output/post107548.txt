Upgrade from Lion to Mountain Lion but not Mavericks <body> I have to downgrade from Mavericks to Mountain Lion due to some software required for work. I used the Internet Recovery method to downgrade, but it is not Lion. I would like to upgrade to Mountain Lion, but there is only Mavericks available in the Mac App Store.  <answer107556> You can purchase OS X Mountain Lion still via Apple online:  Buy OS X Mountain Lion  Once you buy it for $19.99 they will send you an App Store link.  <comment126126> Had you upgraded that machine from Lion to Mountain Lion previously? <comment126144> @peisee See my answer to this question http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106282/is-it-possible-to-still-upgrade-to-os-x-10-8-mountain-lion
