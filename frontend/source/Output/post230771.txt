Installing El Capitan on a new SSD <body> So a week ago I was told on this website that if I wanted to make my Mac (MacBook Pro early 2011, 13") really faster, I should replace my HDD with an SSD. And I'm about to buy this Samsung SSD. But one question went threw my mind.  After I physically install the SSD in the computer, how do I install the OS? I want to do a fresh install, but will there be a menu that asks me what I want to do with this new SSD, whether I want to import data from my old hard drive, or completely reinstall an OS?  I think I will need a USB stick with the El Capitan installer, but how will I proceed next?  <answer230774> If your HDD is still mounted you can download El Capitan from the Apple App Store and create a USB installer thumb drive:  ol liDownload the OS X installer from the Mac App Store. Quit the installer if it opens automatically after downloading. The installer will be in your Applications folder./li liMount your USB flash drive or other volume. You could also use a secondary internal partition. Partition the thumb drive with emDisk Utility/em: one partition, Mac OS X Extended Journaled and GUID partition table and rename it (e.g. MyVolume)./li liOpen the Terminal app, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder./li liUse the codecreateinstallmedia/code command in Terminal to create the bootable installer. Examples of this command are in the next section. For detailed usage instructions, make sure that the appropriate Install OS X app is in your Applications folder, then enter one of the following paths in Terminal:  precode#with MyVolume: the name of your USB thumb drive volume sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app /code/pre/li liShutdown your Mac and replace the hard drive./li liBoot your Mac - you may have to hold the kbdalt/opt/kbd and choose the installer thumb drive as boot volume. Sometimes this doesn't work on the first attempt. Just reboot again!/li liPartition the SSD with Disk Utility which is included in the installer thumb drive(AFAIR in the menubar - Utilities): one partition, Mac OS X Extended Journaled and GUID partition table and rename it (e.g. Macintosh HD). Quit Disk Utility and install El Capitan./li /ol  If you already attached the SSD you can use Internet Recovery Mode (hold kbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd or kbdalt/kbdkbdcmd/kbdkbdR/kbd while booting) to first partition the new internal drive and then restore the original system (10.7 Lion). Then - after configuring Lion - you can to upgrade to El Capitan. This is not recommended because it takes at least twice the time/download.  <comment281728> In step 7, you said I had to partition the SSD. Is it what you do when you have to make a Hard drive/Solid state drive "compatible" with the rest of the computer ? How do you do that ? <comment281730> So that means Disk Utility will already be on the SSD when I buy it ? <comment281732> Ah ok ! One last little question : after step 6 (where I select the installer), when I boot my Mac for the first time with the SSD, after holding the `alt` key, will there be a menu showing up or a strange terminal/console ? Oh yeah, and which format will I have to choose for the partition ? <comment281734> Ok, thank you very much !
