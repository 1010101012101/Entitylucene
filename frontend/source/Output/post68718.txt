Time Capsule hangs on restart when multiple USB devices attached <body> I've got a time capsule with 2 printers and a hard drive connected via a powered USB hub. When the unit is restarted, The indicator light on the front of the device remains yellow and never turns green.  I can't connect to the device via the airport utility.    I've found that I have to unplug the hub from the drive until the unit boots up and the indicator light shows green and then reconnect the hub. All the devices seem to be operating fine and I can do networked printing and access the hard drive normally when it's reconnected.  Has anyone else experienced this issue and found a way around unplugging my devices during restart?  Are there any logs I can check to diagnose this issue?  <comment79835> What happens when each USB device is plugged into the Time Capsule individually instead of through the hub and the TC restarted
