Cursor jerking even when mouse connected and trackpad disabled <body> My MacBook's mouse cursor started jerking yesterday. I assumed it was due to trackpad damage, so plugged in my mouse when I got home and selected "disable trackpad when mouse present". However the cursor is still jerking. Anything I can do? I'm still under AppleCare.  (I tried fixing the trackpad issue by placing my whole palm on it several times to reset it - sometimes works - and shutting down for a while with the computer upside down to help remove any dampness. There was no obvious water exposure immediately prior to the problem.)
