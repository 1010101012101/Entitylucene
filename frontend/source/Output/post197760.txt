Mac Air iMessage problems <body> I recently plugged my iPhone to my Mac. Ever since I did that, every time that I text on my iPhone it shows an icon pop up on the Mac screen, however I am not set up through messaging on my Mac. I am wondering if there is a way to stop the computer from showing that I am typing and showing who I am texting. It does not show conversation or any details, just who I am texting. It is pretty annoying.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjDto.png" alt="enter image description here"br img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/k0Cbp.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer197763> You have codeHandoff/code turned on under codeSettings/codecodeGeneral/codecodeHandoff &amp; Suggested Apps/code on your iPhone.  Switch off codeHandoff/code and you shouldn't see it anymore.  Though I would be more concerned with the message to "ransom"....  <comment236474> Can you attach the screenshot with this issue? <comment236475> i added them to the previous post. the second picture is when i tap the icon. It shows a conversation wanted to be started with the person I was texting on my iPhone. <comment236521> that is a last name for someone lol but thank you so much for the help!!!
