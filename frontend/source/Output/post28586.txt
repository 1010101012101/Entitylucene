Does the iPhone 4 still vibrate in your ear if you receive a text message during a call? <body> With iOS 5 upon us, does the iPhone 4 still vibrate in your ear if you receive a text message (or any kind of notification) during a call?  <answer28596> I don't know for sure if it vibrates (if silent), but it most certainly plays notification sounds for text messages.  <answer28599> Haven't tried with text messages, but with Whatsapp and emails it does, unfortunately :(  So to answer the second part of your question, yes notifications vibrates during call.  <comment32876> If the answer is no, that's definitely something to be added to [this list](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27761/what-tiny-thing-in-ios-5-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard). <comment33354> I'm assuming the same would apply to text messages then. :(
