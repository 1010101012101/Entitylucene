Automate/wrap a few SH scripts in one - Deploystudio <body> Right now I have a few .sh scripts that are being deployed via Deploystudio. I've created seperate scripts and tasks for each command. Though, it doesn't really function. The logs tell me that I need to specify each location for each script.  I want to know: Isn't it possible to execute all these scripts at the same time in either one scripts or package/automator. So that it looks like these scripts are running like in terminal.  Here you can see how it is set up:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lXYbX.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b3AJ0.png" alt=""
