How do I stop getting password notifications from iCloud? <body> I have been having this weird issue where my phone keeps asking for my iCloud password.  I enter the password but then it says the password is locked.  Is there a way I can fix this or get rid of all the nonfictions it keeps giving me?    My iPhone has been doing this way more often since the iOS 10.0.2 update.   <answer258286> From Apple KB : If your Apple ID is locked     h1If your Apple ID is locked/h1      If you or someone else enters your password, security questions, or   other account information incorrectly too many times, your Apple ID   automatically locks to protect your security and you can't sign in to   any Apple services. You can unlock your Apple ID after you verify your   identity.      If your Apple ID is locked for security reasons, you might see one of   these alerts:      ul   li“This Apple ID has been disabled for security reasons”/li   li"You can't sign in because your account was disabled for security reasons"/li   li"This Apple ID has been locked for security reasons"/li   /ul      When you see one of these alerts, you can go to iforgot.apple.com   to unlock your account with your existing password or to reset your   password. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to unlock your   account, your Apple ID will remain locked and you can try again the   next day.      If you use two-step verification, you need to use your recovery   key and a trusted device. And if you use two-factor   authentication, you need a trusted device or trusted phone number   to unlock your Apple ID.      If you see a message that is different from the alerts above and you   can't reset your password, contact Apple for help.   <comment322937> Possible duplicate of [Why does my iPad keep asking for my iCloud password?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128868/why-does-my-ipad-keep-asking-for-my-icloud-password)
