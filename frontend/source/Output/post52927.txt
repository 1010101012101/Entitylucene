Time machine stuck on cleaning up/ Error -47 <body> I have been using time machine with the same disk for a year or so and until now it was fine. But since yesterday, it gets stuck at "cleaning up" and if I say "stop backing up" nothing happens. I tried repairing the disk with the disk utility and it seemed to be ok. I also tried a "full reset" (http://pondini.org/TM/A4.html), to no avail. Time machine buddy shows me the following:   precodeStarting standard backup Backing up to: /Volumes/LaCie 1/Backups.backupdb Event store UUIDs don't match for volume: Macintosh HD Node requires deep traversal:/ reason:must scan subdirs|new event db| No pre-backup thinning needed: 71.44 GB requested (including padding), 243.73 GB available Stopping backup.

Does anyone know what Error: (-47) means? What can I do to fix this?  <answer63694> h1-47/h1  This almost certainly indicates that the file is busy.

I did everything but to no avail.  If you are on the same boat as me, I fixed it upgrading to Mountain Lion.  <comment73684> Please: which operating system? What model is the LaCie, and how is it connected?
