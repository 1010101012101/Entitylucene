My calendar won't work on my iPhone 4 since upgrading to iOS8. I am unable to save events <body> All my history and future events (except birthdays attached to my contacts) are gone and I can't save new events.  When I view my calendar in iCloud from my computer they are all there.  They're just not syncing with my phone!  I don't have my calendar in my phone synced to any other calendar either. How can I resolve this?  <answer108534> To save new events to your Calendar go to strongSettings  Mail, Contacts, Calendars/strong.  I clicked on Hotmail and then turned on strongCalendars/strong. After that the gray code+/code went red and I can now save events again.  <answer127306> I struggled with this for quite a while. Out of nowhere, I could not add any events or reminders to my calendar, and the (+) in the corner of my calendar was grey. Super frustrating!  Go under strongsettings./strong Select strongMail, Contacts, Calendars./strong  You must click on individual accounts, and move the slider for strongcalendar/strong to the "on" position. For instance, I have an iCloud account, and multiple gmail accounts listed. I clicked on each account, and turned on all of the calendar sliders.  This fixed the problem, and I am now able to add events, and view birthdays and events.  <comment123451> Have you maybe accidently turned of syncing for iCloud? If not then try to disable and then enable it again. <comment177082> Are you sure it's an iPhone 4 and not a 4S? The oldest device that iOS 8 supports is the iPhone 4S. <comment177089> I'm having his problem with my iPhone 4s. The add button is not greyed out, I can add things to the calendar but it won't save. It shows up on the other calendars that I have synced, but not to my iphone, which it one of the more important places. Any ideas? I've rebooted my phone and checked the cloud settings. Thank you!
