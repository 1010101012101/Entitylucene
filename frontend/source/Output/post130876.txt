Get contact photo iOS <body> I took a photo using the contact app on my iPhone 5.  I would like to copy that photo, but there doesnt appear to be an easy way to get it.  I did some googling, but all the answers were several years old - and all of them said you could not do it.    There was emone/em answer that required programming that the poster said "emsupposedly/em could do it", but I dont have the development tools (or working Mac) to even try.  Anyone know of a way to extract the contact photos?  <answer130883> You can hold down on the contact photo to copy it:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ctnye.png" width="320"  <answer266133> Paste in a text message to yourself. Send it. Then you can copy it to photos.   <comment153603> ok... did that... where can i paste it? <comment153604> @Keltari "*I would like to copy that photo*" :) It's up to you â€” what do you want to do with it? <comment153605> i just want to save it to photos or somewhere i can move it to a pc <comment153606> @Keltari Paste it in an email and send it to yourself? <comment153607> you are my hero
