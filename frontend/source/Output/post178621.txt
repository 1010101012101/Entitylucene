Homebrew says my Python installation could cause issues and I'm not sure what to do <body> I'm just getting started with web development and I'm trying to set up my environment, and I can't do that until Dr Homebrew has discharged me from N00bcake Hospital. This is what I'm getting:  precodeWarning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories. `./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when compiling and linking.  Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python-config   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2-config   /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7-config  Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework  Homebrew only supports building against the System-provided Python or a brewed Python. In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can interfere with other software installs. /code/pre  I'm worried because I already have a working installation of Python which is a good enough algorithm playground, and I don't want to leave my framework worse than it was before, but I reckon I should do what Homebrew says if I want to continue. Should I just run code$ rm -f /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/code and call it a day or is there something else I must do? code$ python --version &amp;&amp; python3 --version/code returns  precodePython 2.7.6 Python 3.3.2 /code/pre  and code$ brew --config/code returns  precodeHOMEBREW_VERSION: 0.9.5 ORIGIN: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew.git HEAD: 1304a2b29a3de5da2b31e1656bf772eea2a78dc1 Last commit: 5 hours ago HOMEBREW_PREFIX: /usr/local HOMEBREW_CELLAR: /usr/local/Cellar CPU: dual-core 64-bit core2 OS X: 10.6.8-i386 Xcode: 4.2 CLT: N/A GCC-4.2: build 5666 LLVM-GCC: build 2336 Clang: 3.0 build 211 X11: 2.7.7 =&gt; /opt/X11 System Ruby: 1.8.7-p249 Perl: /usr/bin/perl Python: /usr/local/bin/python =&gt; /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7 Ruby: /usr/bin/ruby =&gt; /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby Java: 1.6.0_65 /code/pre  which brings up another odd thing: I was certain my processor was a 32 bit Intel Core Duo and that's why I couldn't update my OS, but this says codedual-core 64-bit core2/code. What is going on?  <answer178801> When I run codebrew doctor/code the first bit of output says this:  precodePlease note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks! /code/pre  Followed by a warning similar to yours about config files that codebrew/code can see which are part of an Anaconda Python install.  So, if you're not having any problems, you shouldn't feel too bad about taking their advice and just ignoring the warning.  However, the reason that you're getting the warnings is because the MacPython install process added a symlink in code/usr/local/bin//code to it's Python directory under code/Library/Frameworks/.../code.  There's nothing wrong with this emper se/em, but, as you've found, it's always possible that it could conflict with assumptions made by other stuff that uses code/usr/local/bin//code (e.g., Homebrew).  You might want to look into virtualenv as a way of managing your Python development environments in general.  I haven't given this much thought, but I'd be tempted to remove those links that MacPython put in code/usr/local/bin//code and create a virtualenv that points to whichever MacPython version you want to use for a particular project.  <comment211844> Oe use another package manager that does not install in /usr/local - that directory is for code you manage
