iPhone is displaying weird time 9:41 <body> My iPhone 5S with 9.1 is displaying code09:41/code when it's actually 18:29 local time.   It doesn't seems to be a time channel problem 9:12 is a weird difference (I'm currently in GMT+1).   <answer214111> EHHHH was connected to my Mac with the video stream launched in QuickTime (my iPhone was the input).   9:41 is the "famous" time displayed during the keynotes :)   Quitting the video stream solves the problem.   <comment258461> Nice find! 09:40 is 'one more thing' time! <comment280243> I've noticed this also happens when using Quicktime to play iDevice audio through the computer, per http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/192910/5029. The time at the top of the displays changes to 9:41, and the phone service provider's logo changes to a wifi symbol.
