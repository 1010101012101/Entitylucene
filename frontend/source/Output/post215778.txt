How can I eject my external Time Machine hard disk attached to a MacBook Pro? <body> I used the external hard disk with Time Machine for the first time. After that when I tried to eject the disk, I got a message saying that it can't be ejected because it is being used by some processes. I downloaded an app called "What's keeping me?" which tells what processes are using some disk or file. I got these results:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hy2pE.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZLYf3.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D7uyp.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aiz9I.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OeNWa.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MsCes.png" alt=""  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ApAjd.png" alt=""  What can I do?  <comment260675> Is "/Volumes/ammar" an external disk? <comment260685> @klanomath Yes. It's the external disk that I am using with Time Machine <comment260697> What if I shutdown the computer? Will this cause problems? <comment260705> It shouldn't cause any problems
