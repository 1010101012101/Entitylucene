Can I get less(1) to display the final line, without selecting it? <body> When less(1) is looking at a file with a long name, pressing code=/code updates only the final line on screen.  For example, with the Terminal window at 80 columns and 27 rows (the default, I think), if I do:  precodeless /Library/Updates/ProductMetadata.plist /code/pre  and then press code=/code, the bottom line says:  precodess RETURN) /code/pre  and the rest of the window doesn't change at all.  I know it knows that the other lines have different text now, though, because if I select the text with the mouse, the last two lines become:  precode/Library/Updates/ProductMetadata.plist lines 1-22/14295 byte 649/917106 0%  (pre ss RETURN) /code/pre  Is there any way to set up less(1) or Terminal.app so it doesn't require me to fiddle with it in order to see longer filenames?  <comment192484> Can't reproduce this for now, Terminal 2.5. What version of OS X/Terminal are you using? <comment192486> OS X 10.9.5, Terminal 2.4.  Is it fixed in Yosemite, perhaps? <comment192487> No, I can reproduce this in Terminal v2.5, OS X 10.10.2. It appears to occur if the Terminal width is 90 (which is the width of the text that appears when hitting `=` <comment192491> @Scot and Ken: Which version of less are you using? I am using version 418 (which is pretty old actually). <comment192492> I am also using v418 (the stock version installed on my Mac). However, I can reproduce the issue using v444 as well (on a non OS X machine). <comment192510> I was using 418 (came installed with OS X 10.9), but I tried it with 458 (latest version, installed through Homebrew) just now and got exactly the same result.
