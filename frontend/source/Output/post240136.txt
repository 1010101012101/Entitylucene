How to adjust the left margin in Pages' Business Resume template <body> In the screenshot below, can someone tell me please how to shift the main text area to the left?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8jUUi.png" alt="How do you reduce the left margin in Pages&#39; Business Resume template?"  From the ruler, one can see the text begins at about 6.7 cm.  Changing Document Margins from the default 2.12 cm to 0 cm helps, but still a long way from 2 cm.  No adjustment of text columns, tabs and indents proved fruitful.  Similar in nature to How to move &quot;section&quot;/change &quot;section&quot; margin in Pages but this one is tougher â€” not even an Apple Support rep knew how to get around it other than to use "Convert to Page Layout" which removes body text altogether.  Thanks to anyone's efforts to solve the mystery.  <answer240156> Click on "Document" menu item at top right, then "Document" in the right tab view, then you can control the placement under "Document margins" at the bottom.  <comment295028> Does moving the blue thing at the top not work? <comment295041> @JMY1000 No, it refuses to move any further left than that. <comment295042> @grgarside How'd you figure that out? <comment295043> @JMY1000 Opened the template myself and tried. <comment295044> @grgarside Ah. Silly me. <comment295048> *"Changing Document Margins from the default 2.12 cm to 0 cm helps, but still a long way from 2 cm."* <comment295259> Thanks for your efforts, but that is one of the first things I tried.
