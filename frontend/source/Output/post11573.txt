Chrome: Keyboard shortcut to go to Address Bar? <body> I just recently switched from Windows and *nix to OS X, and I miss being able to hit F6 to go straight to my Address Bar. What's the OS X equivalent?  <answer11574> To switch quickly to the Address Bar use:  ul liMac/OS X:     kbd⌘/kbd+kbdL/kbd/li liWin/Linux:     kbdCtrl/kbd+kbdL/kbd/li /ul  <comment12127> see also: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1054/keyboard-shortcut-for-accessing-address-bar-in-firefox <comment12206> IIRC cmd+L works also in Safari, Firefox and Opera; and ctrl+L does the same magic in Windows' versions of the browsers — though not in the same manner in IE: it opens up an `Open URL` dialog.
