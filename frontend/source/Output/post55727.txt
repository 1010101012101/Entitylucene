Where can I find the unicode symbols for Mac functional keys? (Command, Shift, etc.) <body> Is there a list of key-symbols that I could reference?  <answer55729> If you are talking about something like this: code&amp;#8984;/code (the &#8984; key), then you are looking for this chart:  precodeHTML Entity     GLYPH  NAME &amp;#63743;              Apple &amp;#8984;         ⌘      Command, Cmd, Clover, (formerly) Apple &amp;#8963;         ⌃      Control, Ctl, Ctrl &amp;#8997;         ⌥      Option, Opt, (Windows) Alt &amp;#8679;         ⇧      Shift &amp;#8682;         ⇪      Caps lock &amp;#9167;         ⏏      Eject &amp;#8617;         ↩      Return, Carriage Return &amp;#8629; &amp;crarr; ↵      Return, Carriage Return &amp;#9166;         ⏎      Return, Carriage Return &amp;#8996;         ⌤      Enter &amp;#9003;         ⌫      Delete, Backspace &amp;#8998;         ⌦      Forward Delete &amp;#9099;         ⎋      Escape, Esc &amp;#8594; &amp;rarr;  →      Right arrow &amp;#8592; &amp;larr;  ←      Left arrow &amp;#8593; &amp;uarr;  ↑      Up arrow &amp;#8595; &amp;darr;  ↓      Down arrow &amp;#8670;         ⇞      Page Up, PgUp &amp;#8671;         ⇟      Page Down, PgDn &amp;#8598;         ↖      Home &amp;#8600;         ↘      End &amp;#8999;         ⌧      Clear &amp;#8677;         ⇥      Tab, Tab Right, Horizontal Tab &amp;#8676;         ⇤      Shift Tab, Tab Left, Back-tab &amp;#9250;         ␢      Space, Blank &amp;#9251;         **␣**  Space, Blank /code/pre  <answer55743> I like to use the widget...  h1CharacterPal/h1  ul liWhen you hover over a symbol, you can see its coding./li liCopy a symbol to the clipboard by clicking on it.

It's only $45. ), you can just import the "Keyboard" snippet group from Dr. Dang (see the second part of the post) and get the symbols you're likely looking for:  precodeTo insert   Type    Key name       ⌘       ;cmd    Command       ⌥       ;opt    Option       ⇧       ;shift  Shift       ⌃       ;ctl    Control       ⇥       ;tab    Tab       ⌫       ;bs     Backspace       ⌦       ;del    Forward Delete       ⌅       ;enter  Enter       ↩       ;return     Return       ⎋       ;esc    Escape              ;apple  Apple       ←       ;left   Left Arrow       →       ;right  Right Arrow       ↑       ;up     Up Arrow       ↓       ;down   Down Arrow       ␣       ;space  Space /code/pre  He also has a few other interesting "set of snippets" you might want to have a look at:  ul liCurrency icons and Fractions - See here for info./li liMiscellaneous Symbols - see here for info./li /ul  Hope this helps!  <answer293486> Just press CTR+SHIFT+Space to bring up the built-in strongCharacters/strong popup and use the search field to type the unicode name of the character, i.e. codeplace of interest/code for kbd⌘/kbd, codeoption/code for kbd⌥/kbd, etc.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DAjuo.png" alt="osx Characters popup for unicode special characters"     ✔️ You can also use it to insert emojis.

Is it what you were looking for? If so, I can make then copyable. <comment63977> @daviesgeek I made them copyable, but I couldn't come up with a good format. <comment63981> @CajunLuke How'd you do that? Thanks BTW. <comment63987> @daviesgeek I typed them out by hand once, then used a regex find/replace to make two columns so I didn't have to type twice. <comment63988> @pcperini You might also be interested in [this awesome tip](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/a/1282/13414) by user stuffe. <comment64286> @CajunLuke Nice! Thanks so much for all that work!!!! I appreciate it!!!!! <comment64376> The reason I rolled back your answer was primarily formatting-related. CSV isn't real useful on a webpage. I added the characters you said we missed. (Which we did miss, as I used the screenshot that had been there as a reference.) If I got the number wrong or you want to add the HTML 5 named references, please edit those parts. <comment64377> Also, what's better about the hexadecimal versions? (TBH, I didn't know you could do HTML literal references in hex.) <comment64409> @CajunLuke Decimal code points are less common in other contexts; for example you can't search for them in Character Viewer. CSV is easier to parse for use in temporary scripts, easier to output, and easier to convert to an HTML table. <comment64557> I made http://mackeys.info/ years ago for that. Enjoy! :) If you need these symbols often, you may want to [create a custom keyboard layout so you can just type them](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/45402/4408). <comment234288> I would also update this with the `control+command+space` shortcut added in OS X also has a "technical" symbols added <comment252093> @MathiasBynens Broken link. <comment267558> link is broken :(
