How to move all pictures from 'photos' to a hard disk? <body> I know that all pictures from 'photos' are stored in the photos library. I want to move the whole library to my hard disk due to space constraints. I know that they are located in the masters folder.   The problem is, pictures are located according to the date of import in many separate folders. Is there any method to get all of them into a single folder? It would be easier to browse if they were all in one big folder/fewer folders.  <answer266498>    Is there any method to get all of them into a single folder?

You can use Finder to search for all files.  ul liOpen code~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/Masters/code in Finder*/li liPress kbd⌘/kbd+kbdF/kbd/li liSelect emSearch/em: em“Masters”/em in the toolbar/li liSelect emType/em: emImage/em as a search criterion, or/li liUse the strong+/strong button to add more search criteria as required/li /ul  This will show all photos as a flat list. (Thus, copying them will copy the individual files without the folder structure.)  For easy access, you can use the emSmart Folder/em feature to store this search for later. Just press the strongsave/strong button.  hr  * subIf you're using Mac OS in a language other than English, the folder may be named in your language, like code~/Pictures/Fotos-Mediathek.photoslibrary/Masters/code or code~/Pictures/Phototèque.photoslibrary/Masters/code. The easiest way is to type codeopen ~/Pictures/*.photoslibrary/Masters/code from a terminal./sub  <comment334084> If you just want to move the library, don't attempt to pick apart its format, just move it - see http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259941/how-to-back-up-photos-library-to-an-external-hard-drive/259945#259945 for a method <comment334088> Thanks. I guess my library is already consolidated. Is that why it shows in grey (I'm not able to click on it). So I can't separate folders right? <comment334089> If 'Copy items to Photos Library' has always been checked, then there's nothing to consolidate & the entire PhotosLibrary can be copied/moved as one entity. For safety, I'd copy it, check the copy is good before deleting the old. You can dictate which Lib to use if you hold opt straight after you launch Photos <comment334181> Nice solution, and a great note regarding other languages!
