How to search file name that contains asterisk (*)? <body> I want to search file name that contains asterisk (*), e.g.  precode*abc.jpg xy*z.pdf 123*.txt /code/pre  How can I do that in Finder?  <answer275975> Well, just type code*/code. It isn't treated any different than other characters:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/egde5.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H8WcO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment347251> I just realized that I need to use advanced search with name contains *, so that any * inside documents will be filtered out. Your answer is correct. <comment347252> I tested that as well, and it seems to work as well when using the 'Name matches' option.
