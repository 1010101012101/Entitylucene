Replacing El Capitan with Mavericks <body> I'm trying to install Mavericks from a bootable USB.  I'm using this guide; http://macpaw.com/how-to/clean-install-os-x-mavericks-on-my-mac  I delete El Capitan in disk utility, but there is no 'Install OS X', merely 'Reinstall OS X', which asks me to reinstall El Capitan.   Where is the option to roll back to previous operating systems?  EDIT: This is on an early 2015 model Apple Air.  <answer235995> You have not written what your MAC, ie, it is unclear whether the installation it is possible Mavericks.  Minimum Supported Operating System for your computer can be viewed using Mactracker or MachineProfile  Additionally:     Back in February, Apple's Worldwide Developer Certificate, designed to   verify third-party apps and services, expired, requiring Apple to   issue a new certificate for developers to use. OS X installation files   downloaded from the Mac App Store before February 14, 2016 and stored   on a computer or USB drive are no longer functional. This includes   installation files for OS X El Capitan and older versions of OS X like   Mavericks and Mountain Lion. Users who keep OS X installers on hand or   have created USB install disks in case of emergencies should replace   their files with new versions by re-downloading them through the Mac   App Store using purchased history.      Users who can't replace an expired certificate can still use older   installers by changing the dates on their machines.      ol   liIn the OS X Installer, choose Utilities  Terminal./li   liEnter codedate 0201010116/code and press Return./li   liQuit Terminal and continue the install./li   /ol   OS X Installers Downloaded Prior to February 14 No Longer Work After Certificate Update  <comment288691> Did you download Mavericks from the App Store? <comment288753> General rule is, you cannot install any OS older than the machine itself. That machine came with Yosemite, so won't accept Mavericks.
