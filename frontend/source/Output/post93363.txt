XCode repeatedly hangs on launch <body> I'm new to OSX and running Mountain Lion in a Virtual Box VM. Xcode was running fine and I managed to create a simple Hello World App. I restarted the VM and when I tried to reopen my project Xcode crashed. I didn't think anything of this at the time but every time that I have relaunched Xcode since, it has frozen at this stage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fcYki.png" alt="enter image description here"  The CPU goes up to 95%ish usage and I have to force quit Xcode.

What type of Mac is the host? <comment109554> [Is Mac OS X in a VirtualBox VM suitable for iOS development?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/63147/8546)
