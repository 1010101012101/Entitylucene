Cannot move dock icons in Mountain Lion <body> When I drag an existing icon from one place to another in Mountain Lion I cannot click to release it. It just remains 'stuck' to the mouse pointer.  Anyone know how to fix this?  <answer58382> Have you restarted your machine? Sometimes when I get working on lots of tasks on my Mac, it takes awhile to get any response from the dock. I save and close out of all my apps and restart the machine.  <answer58421> Sometimes with everything running on your Mac it can get clustered and not be as responsive, Try and go to Applications-Utilities-Activity Monitor and Find Dock PID 167. Then click it and Quit process, This will close the dock and reopen it. And that should fix it.  <comment67174> yes of course. several times before I posted.
