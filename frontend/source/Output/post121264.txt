How can you mark every item in Safari's reading list as "read"? <body> I just want to mark every item in my Reading List as read. All 200+ of them. Is there a CLI solution, or a way to edit the code~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist/code file to mark them as  read?  <answer121981> The XML tag that determines whether the article has been read is codeDateLastViewed/code.  I think the simplest, most user friendly way to do it (for most people, anyway) is with TextEdit find-and-replace.  First, though, you're going to have to convert the plist file from binary to XML with this command (Enter it at the prompt in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app): codeplutil -convert xml1 'Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist'; open 'Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist' -a TextEdit/code Don't worry if it gives you an error; that just means it has already been converted. The command will also open up the newly converted file in TextEdit.  Find-and-replace  pre &lt;key&gt;DateAdded&lt;/key&gt; /pre with pre &lt;key&gt;DateLastFetched&lt;/key&gt;&lt;date&gt;2012-10-13T12:15:04Z&lt;/date&gt;&lt;key&gt;DateLastViewed&lt;/key&gt;&lt;date&gt;2012-10-13T12:15:04Z&lt;/date&gt;&lt;key&gt;DateAdded&lt;/key&gt; /pre What this does is puts the DateLastViewed (and DateLastFetched, just to be safe) before every time it finds a DateAdded. I don't know if it actually uses the dates for anything, but you can change them if you want.
