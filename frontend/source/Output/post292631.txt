Spotlight completely broken <body> My spotlight index is completely broken. It can't find anything at all, every single thing I search for just returns 'no results'. Here's what I've tried:  ul liRe-indexing spotlight through System Preferences. I added the Applications folder to the Privacy filter and then deleted it, but it didn't seem to help. Same with other folders that I tried./li liFixing disk permissions. Permissions weren't broken, so there was nothing to fix./li liRe-installing Sierra. I was ready to lose all my data, I've got it backed up, but it kept all the data I had when I re-installed the OS. And spotlight is still broken./li /ul  I'm really confused, not sure where to go from here.  <answer292905> For anyone who needs the solution, run  precodesudo mdutil -i off / sudo mdutil -i on / /code/pre  This forces a reindex.  <comment369193> Have you tried killing `SystemUIServer` or manually rebuilt Spotlight with `sudo mdutil-U /`? <comment369546> @haykam, thanks, I looked up mdutil, and the -i flag did the trick! <comment369563> Good to know! :)
