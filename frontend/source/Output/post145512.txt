Can I tell if a device has an active Activation Lock before inserting a SIM card? <body> I got an iPhone 5c off of eBay and I can't tell if it's iCloud locked (Activation Lock) or not because I don't have a SIM card for it yet. It was restored by iTunes with no problems. The phone asks me for my language, country, WiFi, then tells me to insert a SIM. Is it going to tell me I need the previous owners password after I get the SIM card and insert it?  <answer145520> emIf you are referring to "Find my iPhone" with "if it's icloud locked":/em  No, "Find my iPhone" must be turned off on your new iPhone. iTunes doesn't let you restore an iDevice with turned on "Find my iPhone" (on iOS 7 and greater)   <answer148055> Yes, Apple has a very easy page that lets you look up devices by IMEI or Serial Number:  ul lihttps://www.icloud.com/activationlock//li /ul  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3Kg9.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment171510> is the WiFi working? if yes use it to access iCloud. <comment171536> @Buscar Could you expand what you mean? OP does not have a SIM card to 'access iCloud'â€¦?
