Why does a find field value in one application show up in a the find field of another application? <body> On my MacBook Pro I have found that several applications seem to share the value for a find.  For example, I searched 'applestackexchange' in Safari's unified address bar, then I switch to Xcode and click into a Find field.  The first word of my search in Safari then appears there.  iTerm2 and Sublime Text 2 also seem to participate in this sharing.  Running latest Mountain Lion on  a 2012 MBP.  <comment93946> I noticed that too. It's probably a bug and the reason for that must be that they use the same buffer for the search text.
