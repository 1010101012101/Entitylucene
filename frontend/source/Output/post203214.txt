How do I split a large Pages document into multiple Pages documents <body> I have a rather large Pages document that has many sections.  I need to break each of those sections out into their own Pages documents.   I am using codePages 5.5.3/code.  Can this be done easily? Right now I'm in cut and paste mode.   <answer204987> Although you could script this in AppleScript since Pages is scriptable, I've never had enough sections to make the time spent crafting a script worth the time needed to figure out the syntax.  I simply duplicate the document as many times as needed in finder, batch rename them using Finder.  If you had 64 sections, I would use a "binary search" approach.  ul lisplit the document in 2/li lisplit in 4/li lisplit by 8/li lisplit by half/li /ul  I've never liked copy/paste since things get odd sometimes. Chopping out the unneeded parts always seems to work better for me, but your manual copy/paste method also will work.  <comment248135> That's an interesting approach to the problem. <comment248136> @dennis.hempler Sorry to offer a brute force approach. The zip file and xml  structure of a pages document makes the tools I would normally use poor choices.
