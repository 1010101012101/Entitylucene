PreventUserIdleSystemSleep == 1, but mac still sleeps (sometimes) <body> I noticed that my iMac was not going to sleep automatically after idle; nor was it going in to screensaver mode. In activity monitor, I saw that a custom applet of mine was preventing sleep. pmset gives similar info:  precode$ pmset -g assertions 2016-12-08 10:54:00 -0500  Assertion status system-wide:     ...     PreventUserIdleSystemSleep     1     NetworkClientActive            0 Listed by owning process: pid 927(applet): [0x000002800001024a] 00:00:04 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: "handling Apple event"  pid 899(applet): [0x000001bd00010245] 00:03:19 PreventUserIdleSystemSleep named: "handling Apple event"  /code/pre  What puzzles me is that after rebooting the machine, the mac will go into sleep mode despite those same applets running and despite pmset giving the same output. In other words, from the information I've gleaned from pmset, or from Activity Monitor, those applets should emstill/em be preventing idle initiating sleep mode, but it doesn't. It also goes into Screensaver mode if I idle.  So... is emPreventIdleSystemSleep/em interpreted as a granted permission the process might (but might not) implement, or as an active lock preventing default behavior?
