Create a symbolic link on OSX to a Windows path <body> I'm trying to create a symbolic link on my new MacBook that references a shared folder -- similar to dropbox, but on Box. Everyone on my team has created the symbolic link to be "C:/Bsync". On my Windows PC I used the following code:  precodemklink /D "C:\Bsync" "C:\Users\ns1954\Box Sync" /code/pre  but how do I do it so that my Box Sync folder on my mac (path: /Users/Nina/Box Sync) refers to codeC:\Bsync/code?  I tried this in terminal but it didn't work:     ln -s "Users/Nina/Box Sync" "C:\Bsync"   <comment374155> `C:\ ` is a Windows convention and won't work on macOS.   Where do you want your symlink to be exactly? This is the "root directory" on Windows which isn't a good place to put shared files (on Mac or Windows for that matter)
