Adding to "Open with" list <body> [OSX 10.9.2]  My Mac doesn't think Audacity can open mp4 files, so when I want to do so using "Open with", I have to switch from "Recommended Applications" to "All Applications" so as to select Audacity.  This is only for when I want to extract the audio; I do not want to make Audacity the default app. I am fine with Quicktime being the default.    The question is, can I identify Audacity as being capable of opening an mp4 so I don't always have to switch to "All applications"?  <answer195143> You need to edit Audacity's Info.plist file and add mp4 to the list of files it handles.  Using a text editor, open /Applications/Audacity.app/Contents/Info.plist (this is assuming Audacity is installed as Audacity.app, it might be slightly different).  Then, find the section for CFBundleDocumentTypes which should list the supported types like:  code&lt;key&gt;CFBundleTypeExtensions&lt;/key&gt;     &lt;array&gt;         &lt;string&gt;...&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;...&lt;/string&gt;         &lt;string&gt;...&lt;/string&gt;     &lt;/array&gt;/code  Then just add a new line for mp4: code&lt;string&gt;mp4&lt;/string&gt;/code and save the file.  To get the LaunchService to pick up your change, you have to run (in Terminal):  code/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain system -domain user/code  After that, Audacity should show as a Recommended Application for mp4 files.
