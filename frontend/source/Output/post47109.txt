Removed Facetime - how to recover? <body> So I got this weird situation probably because of my own stupidity. But here goes: I am on Lion (10.7.3) and decided to install FaceTime from the App Store. When trying to install the App Store app says that I need to move current FaceTime.app to trash. When trying to do so the OS says that I cannot remove FaceTime app since it's required by OS. Being confused I open the terminal and go all codesudo rm -fr/code on FaceTime.app. Getting back to App Store I try to install the FaceTime again, but this time I get message saying that MAS version of FaceTime is too old for my OS.  So basically my question boils down to - how do I get my FaceTime app back?  <answer47110> Presume your Trash doesn't have a copy?  There's not a lot you can do without having access to the Lion media.    You should be able to download the whole installer again (Go into the Mac App store, and codeOption-Click/code on Purchases tab to get the option back), extract the DMG from the installer package (Right click and codeShow Package Contents/code), and then hunt down the bits for Facetime.  I'm curious why you did what you did, but it's interesting that it let you get that far.  <answer47111> Getting the FaceTime.app file from your backup or another machine with the same OS version should work.  <answer47112> strongFaceTime/strong is part of the Mac OS since Lion. You should not have had to install this in the first place.  ul liThe version of FaceTime in the Mac App Store is 1.0.2 and for Snow Leopard (since 10.6.6)./li liThe version of FaceTime in Lion is 1.1.1./li /ul  (as of march 2012)  This explains the warning "FaceTime is too old for my OS".  Try to copy the codeFaceTime.app/code package from another Mac.  <comment53948> Yes, I'm not sure why I did what I did. The `rm -fr` doesn't move stuff to trash, so it's gone for good. Will need to check out the dmg thing. <comment53952> My first response would be *recover the app from your own backup.* If you don't have a backup, or access to another copy, you can reinstall Lion which doesn't overwrite your user account. (You *might* also be able to locate and recover the app within a copy of the install image, but I haven't explored that fully.) <comment53954> **Mac Rule of Thumb**if *sudo* is required, you're (in all likelihood) *doing it wrong*, particularly for installing an Apple provided software package. At the very least, it should trigger your *Spidey sense* and a thorough examination of the situation. <comment114895> Don't reinstall for just a single file! If anything, you can just ask kindly for some one here to upload the file for you
