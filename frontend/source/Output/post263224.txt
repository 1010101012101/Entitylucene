External keyboard not working correctly <body> I just bought Genius Scorpion K9 and I just cant get it working properly.  Computer spec:  - MacBook Pro Mid 2014  - MacOs Sierra  Problem: Shift, "super/windows" key not working. Shift (for uppercase is replaced by left ctrl key). I tried Karabiner EventView and those key like they are not pressed.   Another funny thing is, that 'Shift' seems to work on Login page. (password contains uppercase letter).  I tried:  - Reset the PRAM  - Reset the SMC  Any ideas?  <comment329778> The Genius Scorpion K9 site says minimum MS Windows 7/8 is a requirement.  It doesn't say it works on Mac.
