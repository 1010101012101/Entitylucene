iPad calculator app <body> I need a scientific calculator for the iPad; preferably it shows the functions like a real scientific calculator i.e. when you press sin you get sin( on your "display" &amp; not just the result  <answer26602> h1TouchCalc/h1  My favourite calculator app for iOS for some time. Functional, clean interface gets it done. The bit mode is great for algorithm writing with bit manipulations. I think this was one of the first apps I purchased when I got my first iPhone. Still use it daily.  It doesn't do quite what you want when  you hit codesin/code but it does show you, below the answer, that the operation used to compute the answer was codesin/code.  It's available via the App Store. And if it's not free, it's close to it.  <answer26605> I suggest strongPCalc/strong (the lite version is free) or strongi41CX/strong (really good for hard-core fans of HP calculators)  <answer26612> SciCal; it looks and feels like a real scientific calculator, it also plots graphs and has a lot of other features like calculation history and more. This video gives a good overview of this app.  <answer26653> Wolfram Alpha has an iPad app. It is admittedly $1.99 from the App Store, but not only will you get basic calculator features, but some pretty serious math and data reference chops in a small package.  <answer33968> It may be overkill for your needs, but the granddaddy of scientific calculation on the iPad is MathStudio, formerly known as SpaceTime. Not just a scientific/graphing calculator, it's a very complete CAS (computer algebra system). And it does use the infix notation you prefer.  <comment30334> With the whole sin thing I mean that I want the calculator for the iPad to work like a normal scientific calculator i.e. you press sine first & then enter the angle & not the other way round <comment30340> Ah. You want infix style entry. No, TouchCalc does not have that. It's immediate execution style. sine(30) is entered as: `3` `0` `sin` <comment30685> I really like Pcalc.
