How to get Siri to not call you by name <body> Prior to setting a name in Siri, it does not call you by a name. For example ("I'm not sure what you said" rather than "I'm not sure what you said, eminsert name here/em"). So how do I revert to the behavior of not getting called a name after I have set one. There is no option to do that in Settings  General  Siri except changing to a different contact.  <answer248157> It's easy to make Siri forget your name by creating a sacrificial contact:  ol liOpen Contacts and tap the plus sign to create a new entry. Enter any text you like for the name. Tap 'Done'./li liOpen the Settings app and go to Siri's options under the 'General' tab. Tap on "My Info" and change the contact from you to the one you just created./li liGo back to the Contacts app. Select the new contact, tap on 'Edit', scroll down until you see 'Delete Contact', and tap on it./li /ol  That's itâ€”you're done. Siri's settings will now show "None" next to "My Info".  <answer248371> Give yourself a nickname. She will call you by your nick name. Make it "Sir" or "Ma'am" or something like that.
