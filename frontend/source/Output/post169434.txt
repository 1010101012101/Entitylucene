Apple Thunderbolt display not turning on when connected to ASUS Z87 motherboard <body> I recently purchased custom build PC with Asus Z87 Expert Thunderbolt motherboard, Intel i7-4790K processor, Sapphire R9 270X 2 GB graphics card, etc.  It's not working with my Apple Thunderbolt display 27â€³. I have installed Intel Thunderbolt driver as well.  When I connect this PC to the Apple Thunderbolt display, the display won't turn on. I am very disappointed now. Does anybody know how to make it work?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/h1L4H.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/urdlU.jpg" alt=""  <answer169568> strongOkay,/strong I have figured it out myself :) Feeling extremely happy.  strongSteps:/strong    ol liEnter BIOS setting.

Sapphire R9 270X has only HDMI and DP/DV port. No thunderbolt port <comment240252> you can buy a adapter tbdp/dv port or tbhdmi you won't be able to utilise the camera or usb hub on the display though <comment240272> I searched for this kind of cable ( female tb to male hdmi/dp), but could not find anywhere.  Can you suggest any online shopping link? Thanks a lot. <comment240290> a simple amazon search for thunderbolt to hdmi gives 321 pages of hits, note that a mini displayport to hdmi cable is exactly the same and can be used too
