How do I remove purchased GarageBand content? <body> I recently purchased GarageBand's additional content (the $4.99 for everything one) specifically to acquire the drummers. Now I've got around 10GB of unused content eating up a significant portion of my hard drive. How do I remove the sounds and loops installed by GarageBand?  <answer149206> You should look for it in the following place, copy following and paste it in to the Go to Folder in the Finder.  precode/Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand /code/pre  Know-how:  *If you are wondering how I did it, since I do not use the Garageband:  I used the codemdfind -name Garageband/code in Terminal that showed me all locations for it. After that it was easy.*  <comment175809> Check your /Library/Audio/Apple Loops/Apple/Apple Loops for GarageBand <comment175811> Ah yes, there it is. My mistake was looking in ~/Library. Thanks! <comment175812> make it an answer for posterity/google <comment176814> Thanks @Tetsujin will do, was just preoccupied with other stuff to make it a real answer :) <comment176851> it's slightly more complicated than that, if you have/had old versions of Garage Band or Logic - http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1045
