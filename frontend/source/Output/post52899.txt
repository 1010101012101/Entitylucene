Disk Utility Disk Verification <body> I ran the "Verify Disk" tool in disk utility on my main disk called Macintosh HD, and it came up with this log:   precodeVerifying volume “Macintosh HD” Checking storage systemChecking volume. disk0s2: Scan for Volume Headers disk0s2: Scan for Disk Labels Logical Volume Group 4D3DFAA4-7124-4F3F-A19D-D06A1784AB17 spans 1 device Logical Volume Group has a 16 MB Metadata Volume with double redundancy Start scanning metadata for a valid checkpoint Load and verify Segment Headers Load and verify Checkpoint Payload Load and verify Transaction Segment Load and verify Transaction Segment Incorporate 1 newer non-checkpoint transactions Load and verify Virtual Address Table Load and verify Segment Usage Table Load and verify Metadata Superblock Load and verify Logical Volumes B-Trees Logical Volume Group contains 1 Logical Volumes Load and verify E7324686-925A-48BF-8150-A982F1572F20 Load and verify 82E44F05-FEF5-49A9-B3C6-1911EE30BB49 Load and verify Freespace Summary Load and verify Block Accounting Load and verify Segment Cleaning Newest transaction commit checkpoint is valid The volume 4D3DFAA4-7124-4F3F-A19D-D06A1784AB17 appears to be OK.

Thanks  <answer52901> It's not absolutely required, but I'd say it's strongly recommended.  The type of volume corruption it reported isn't as serious as most other types, but my recommendation is the same: don't mess around, fix it emnow/em.  <answer88043> h1File system corruption/h1  In an edge case (say, a hard disk drive with a strongdefective sector/strong used by a critical part of the file system structure (extents overflow B-tree, catalog B-tree, attributes B-tree and more)):   ul lia repair by codefsck_hfs/code might do more harm than good, because drive-controlled reallocation of blocks may result in dataloss. /li /ul  If you're lucky – strongmost people are/strong – then codefsck_hfs/code without attention to media is the simplest and most appropriate course of action. So at the file system level (HFS Plus, in this case JHFS+) the recommended action is almost indisputable.   h1Storage system corruption/h1  As Core Storage is closed source with too little information published by Apple, it's less clear what should be done about emnewer non-checkpoint transactions/em:   ul liWhat's the significance of non-checkpoint transactions in Core Storage?/li /ul  Hint: with Disk Utility, emapparently/em OK is not always OK.   <comment60505> Okay. I'll do that. Thanks.
