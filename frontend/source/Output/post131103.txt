Maybe that breaks internet access? Edit: Seems to be the case. Have a look here: Sophos Website  <comment153884> that does not show the Chrome doing it? <comment153885> if you disable extensions/plugins one by one that could  show who is doing it <comment153888> Re-install chrome and disable plugins in addition to @Buscar웃 <comment153894> Look in the Console for the tab called "CrashReporter" yes it is one word.. and publish it here <comment153923> How exactly does the computer crash? <comment153955> The only way to solve this crash is to press power button and reboot it. <comment153958> but it happens no matter how many tabs I opened <comment153960> I don't have CrashReporter on sidebar. <comment153996> So it was not a Crash, the system locked up. Next time that happens note the time before reboot. After reboot go to Console to the time stamp and copy 30 lines before it happened, and 10 lines after. <comment154034> How to call it? This situation only occur when I use chrome. <comment154035> May 17 16:26:02 localhost bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1400315162 0 <comment154036> May 17 16:26:03 localhost syslogd[18]: Configuration Notice:  ASL Module "com.apple.appstore" claims selected messages.

It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment233946> A friend's 15" MBP is having the same issue: When Google Chrome is opened, the screen will either go black, or be covered in hash lines as if the graphics card is dying or the monitor cable is frayed. OP: Is this the same thing you experience? <comment242786> @user3467070 Maybe you're out of memory/disk? <comment242793> I had similar issue and reported [here](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=523559), but I'm not sure if related.
