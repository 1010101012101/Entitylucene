How do I enable automatic capitalization in OS X? <body> Can I turn on automatic capitalization on my iMac running OS X 10.9, Mavericks? It is selectable in iOS on my iPad but I can't find a similar switch in Mavericks.  <answer116542> It's not available yet on Mavericks as such.  You can ask Apple to add it via  http://www.apple.com/feedback  Some apps might have it internally (but Pages 5 does not, only Pages 4).  <answer178114> You can use a third party such as TextExpander ($35) for this. Paired with the right third party dictionary (TidBITS Autocorrect Dictionary), which is downloadable from within TextExpander, it corrects most of my typos that Mac OS X misses, as well as providing shortcuts for frequently typed snippets.  Using TextExpander just for sentence capitalization is a bit of overkill, but if you embrace it, you wind up with an excellent tool that you can easily adapt to your needs.  <comment136331> Are you perchance meaning the menu item under Edit  Transformations  Capitalize ? Or you looking for a different solution? If different how?
