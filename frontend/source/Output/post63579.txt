Deleted over 4TB on Promise VTrak, still shows as full <body> This is not a duplicate of Why is my hard drive still full after deleting files?  I have of course attempted all methods mentioned there. Via the terminal I can see nothing listed on the drive. I was able to list all the hidden (.named) folders using codels -a | egrep '^\.'/code which then showed me the expected hidden folders, all of which I codesudo rm -rd/code I've ran a Verify/Repair with Disk Utility (not sure of the effectiveness on an external RAID) but it had no effect.  I know a solution is just reformat, but what if I had a 10TB RAID and still had multiple terabytes of data? Formatting would not be an option.  This is not a locked files issue, not a trash issue, what seams to be the problem?  How can I free up the (4TB, claimed to still be taken up) space on the empty 5TB Promise VTrak E610f media RAID?  <answer63965> This was a production server so I couldn't be too forceful.   Inevitably, after hours, a reboot resolved the issue. Not my favorite solution by any means.  <comment73583> Why can’t you erase the disk? I did not understand the reason for that. <comment73654> @duci9y what do you mean by erase? <comment73736> Erase the disk with Disk Utility. <comment73799> @duci9y Can you erase only particular data with Disk Utility? I thought it was only entire volumes...which isn't a solution. Like I said, what if I had 10TB of data on the RAID? I just need to clear up mysterious space being taken up. <comment73800> Unless, are you referring to "Erase free space"? Unfortunately, that did not work either. Thanks for the suggestion. <comment73869> No, I didn’t mean that. I am asking, why can’t you erase the entire volume and start over? <comment74013> "I know a solution is just reformat, but what if I had a 10TB RAID and still had multiple terabytes of data? Formatting would not be an option." <comment74017> I don’t understand what you mean by that, but you have solved your issue, so it doesn’t matter anymore. <comment78243> @duci9y Format == erase. You're talking at cross purposes about the same thing.
