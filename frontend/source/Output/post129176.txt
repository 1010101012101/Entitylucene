How is swap on mid-2013 MacBook Air w/ PCIe SSD? <body> There appears to be confusing and incomplete information about the PCIe SSDs in mid-2013 MacBook Air 11" and 13" (especially the 128GB models), where a different strongqueue depth/strong may result in different speed test results. http://www.anandtech.com/show/7085/the-2013-macbook-air-review-13inch/8  In simple terms, stronghow how much slower is swap on the 128GB PCIe SSD compared to the main memory on the 4GB LDDR3 in the mid-2013 MacBook Air 11" and 13"?/strong  strongWhat about 256GB?/strong  I cannot really find any comprehensive comparison on the topic specific to the proprietary SSDs used by Apple in mid-2013 MacBook Air, especially comparison between 128GB and 256GB models.  A good answer would include methodology through which it's derived.  <comment151213> what is the purpose of your question other then wanting to know? <comment151238> @Buscarì›ƒ, to make a decision whether 8GB of LPDDR3 is worth it, or if 4GB would suffice; to see if upgrading to 256GB drive would make sense instead etc. <comment151243> Going from the 256 and 8 is the best, now it is a question of budget. The only measurable difference (to us humans) is when the SWAP has to be used. The size does matter! so a larger SSD is better if you have a lots of stuff. (but that is purely personal decision). Your first bottleneck is your RAM.
