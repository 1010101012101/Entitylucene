MacBook Pro Retina 13": change resolution to 1920x1200 pixels <body> How can I change the resolution of my MacBook Pro 13" Retina (Late 2013) to 1920x1200 pixels?  The MacBook is able to use this resolution! It's e.g. using it, when connecting a second display which uses 1920x1200 pixels and checking the 'mirror displays' option.  <answer119211> You can use Retina DisplayMenu, QuickRes or SwitchResX.   <answer155129> Although you could do that, I would not recommend to do that. The font and everything else will be very small and it will be hard to read. It also could cause high temperatures on your macbook.
