Mac OS X 10.4 - Thunderbird 3 to Thunderbird 13 <body> I'm working with an ancient PowerPC Mac running Tiger. I managed to migrate the POP email from Apple Mail 2 to Thunderbird 3, but I now need to migrate it to a newer machine with Thunderbird 13. How would I go about doing this?  Does Thunderbird 13 store email in the same format as Thunderbird 3?  Can I just copy over files? What should I do?  <answer54940> It seems that installing Thunderbird 3 on a newer Mac--non PowerPC--is the correct way to go about it.  I'll refer to the older Mac as "machine 1," and the newer Mac as "machine 2."  ol liFind an archived installer for Thunderbird 3./li liInstall Thunderbird 3 on machine 2, and launch it.

TenFourBird is a community port of Thunderbird which requires 10.4 or later and is based on the efforts of TenFourFox. The current stable version of TenFourBird is equivalent to Thunderbird 17. TenFourBird targets only ESR versions of Thunderbird, so version 24 is currently in beta.  <comment63034> But is that necessary? This would be a good chance to upgrade to the latest Thunderbird. <comment63066> Was what necessary?  I can't upgrade to the latest Thunderbird on PPC, Mozilla doesn't support it.  I needed to get it off that computer and onto a newer one. <comment63122> "installing Thunderbird 3 on a newer Mac--non PowerPC": On the new computer, you should be aiming to use Thunderbird 13. It should not be necessary to continue to use the old version on the new machine.
