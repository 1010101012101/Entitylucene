13" Macbook Pro display issues with Mavericks <body> I just installed Mavericks on my 13" Macbook Pro.  I have two external 27" Apple Displays connected to it.  After upgrading, I can only get one of the two external monitors to work in conjunction with the internal Macbook's monitor.  Is there a way to have the two external monitors working and the internal monitor to be disabled?  (This is what happened under Mountain Lion and it was the perfect situation for me)
