Installed mpv with Brew, but nothing in Applications <body> I'm trying to play anime with mpv. I have heard that it's the best player for anime.  https://mpv.io/installation/  I go to the website and I see that there's homebrew.  I run codebrew install mpv/code. It seems to complete successfully. Now what?  There doesn't seem to be an mpv app I can use to open my video files in my /Applications.  <answer288690> If you want to have the application linked to ~/Applications, have homebrew do that.  precodebrew linkapps mpv /code/pre  Since "linkapps" is being removed (for reasons) across all brew recipes, you might instead tap the cask which drops a functioning codempv/code into Applications and runs more like an app than a command line tool.  precodebrew cask install mpv /code/pre  <answer288692> Actually an .mpv file is nothing more than a specific format of MPEG2 video. There is nothing specific to Anime in an .MPV file. In fact you can find Anime in a multitude of video formats all over the internet.   Deciding on what is the "best" player for MPV files is more opinion than anything else and Ask Different discourages opinion based questions.  The specific player you have chosen will work fine but would not be emmy/em (ahem...) first choice as it involves a lot of stuff that is totally unnecessary for playing videos, specifically the installation of Homebrew. Homebrew is very nice but is basically an environment designed for installing Unix-style executables quickly and easily without invoking the use of compilers, shell scripts or other things that many people have no interest in. A bit of overhead for a simple media player.  If all you want to do is play an .mpv file your best bet might be the insanely popular and excellent quality VLC player. It's a direct (web browser link)  download and install and requires nothing more than running the installer in the download. Works a treat and I have been using it successfully for years.  <comment364564> Did you try alternate download link (OS X builds by stolendata): https://laboratory.stolendata.net/~djinn/mpv_osx/mpv-latest.tar.gz <comment364566> Brew prints warning for this option: `Warning: 'brew linkapps' has been deprecated and will eventually be removed!` <comment364567> Good pointer @toma - I believe the goal is to get all of the packages to self-install when it makes sense. Not sure if `mpv` is fundamentally against that or no one has done that work or if the work is problematic for whatever reason. My guess is a cask would be more appropriate for this tool instead of the two step install and then link. <comment364569> As I understand, `brew cask install mpv` is a replacement for `linkapps`. At least I got .app file in my /Applications <comment364571> If `brew install mpv` is complete, run `brew cask install mpv`. .app file should appear in /Applications <comment364572> Thanks brew cask install mpv worked for me. <comment364573> Nah vlc is garbage. I also already have homebrew as I installed mpv successfully. <comment364574> Good points steve - I almost advocated for QuickTime Player in my answer, but I try to presume an OP has good reasons for wanting the specific tool they chose. The cask installs on homebrew are really getting good in my opinion and the fidgety parts where it breaks are getting redesigned so that "it just works" for people not steeped in the shell. +1 in my book for the VLC and discussion on options. <comment364575> @toma If you want to put an answer, I'd rather you for the checkmark and reputation. You got to the answer faster than I and just had it in the comments. <comment364577> @bmike no need, it is not a competition :) <comment364579> I love collaborating - especially when everyone sees the credit as shared (via edits or via a tag on the post) - you honed this one down quickly, @toma
