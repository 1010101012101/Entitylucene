MBP won’t wake up from sleep <body> I have this strange problem with my early-2011 MacBook Pro, running on OS X 10.6.8: as of a month or so, sometimes it does’t wake up from sleep unless I press the power button for a longer period (5-10 seconds). However, when I do that, it starts waking from hibernation (the grey screen with the progress bar appears) and then it restarts. Usually the battery shows half full, so theoretically it shouldn’t go into hibernation.  Anybody else running into this problem? How did you solved it? (I should mention that upgrading to Lion or Mountain Lion is not an option, so please don’t suggest that.)  <answer68293> It sounds like your battery is in bad shape. Your MBP goes to sleep and when it runs out of juice it simply dies.  If that's not the case - meaning the battery got's juice after a hard reset (holding power button for 5+ secs) without hanging to power supply then: First check if there are any Firmware updates. Then try the following:  Open up a Terminal in strong/Applications/Utilities/Terminal/strong and to disable hibernation type:  codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0/code  then remove any trace of previous hibernations:  coderm /private/var/vm/sleepimage/code  After that reset the strongSMC/strong aka System Management Controller:  strongMBP with removable battery:/strong  ul liShut down the computer./li liDisconnect the power adapter /li liRemove the battery./li liPress and hold the power for at least for 5 seconds./li liRelease the power button./li liReconnect the battery /li liTurn on the computer./li /ul  strongMBP with non removable battery:/strong  ul liShut down the computer./li liPlug in the MagSafe power adapter if not already connected./li liPress the Shift-Control-Option strongleft side/strong keys and the power button at the same time./li liRelease all the keys and the power button at the same time./li liTurn on the computer.  /li /ul  The LED on the MagSafe may change states - if so it means your SMC reset was successfull. To enable Safe Sleep again open Terminal and codesudo pmset -a hibernatemode 3/code. Hope that help's.  strongUpdate/strong To have total control of Sleep try this http://semaja2.net/insomniaxinfo  <comment78972> How do you do the sleep mode? only close the lid or sleep menu from mac menu? <comment78973> Sleep from Mac menu or alt + cmd + eject. Almost never put it to sleep just closing the lid. <comment79303> Is it connected to an external display when it happens? <comment79304> @SamuelE.Giddins No.
