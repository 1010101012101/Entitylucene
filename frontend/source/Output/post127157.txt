DNS name of virtual machine <body> I need to reliably access the SqlServer running on my Windows 7 VM. I've tried setting a static ip and reserving that ip for the machine in VMWare's Nat config but that cuts off WAN access from the VM. Right now I am just editing my database url every time I restart the VM. Does anyone have a complete set of instructions on how to configure an internal NAT static IP in VMWare Fusion 5.0?  <answer127199> You'll have to manually edit VMware's network preferences and add static hosts to get this working. The file necessary can be found at code/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/vmnet8/dhcpd.conf/code. The file is read-only so codechmod/code it writeable first.  For each static host you'll have to add the following and change the hostname, MAC address and IP to your VMs:  precodehost yourhosthere {     hardware ethernet 11:22:33:44:55:66;     fixed-address 192.168.87.100; } /code/pre  I'd recommend selecting the IP from outside the DHCP range, which is defined in the same file on the row starting with coderange/code.  After this you have to restart VMware services with codesudo "/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/boot.sh" --restart/code  As for the DNS name, after you have a static IP you can add it to your code/etc/hosts/code file using the following syntax:  precode192.168.87.100 yourhosthere /code/pre  <comment149443> This worked for me with yourhosthere=the host name from the operating system not the VMWare name of the machine. Some of the paths are different in Mavericks. Thanks
