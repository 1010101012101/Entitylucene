Unable to delete .Mobilebackups.trash folder <body> I've am trying to delete the code.Mobilebackups.trash/code folder on OS X 10.11.4 (15E65) by following these steps:  precodesudo mv /.MobileBackups.trash ~/Desktop/MobileBackupsTrash dragging MobileBackupsTrash to the Trash Emptying the trash /code/pre  The last operation failed saying the files are in use so I took the files out of the trash and tried to delete it from the terminal.  This is the content of one of the folder I'm trying to delete:  precode./Volume/total 0 ./Volume/drwxrwxr-x@ 2 root  admin   68 May  3 23:54 Applications ./Volume/drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 May  3 23:54 Library ./Volume/drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 May  3 23:54 private ./Volume/Library/total 0 ./Volume/Library/drwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  102 May  3 23:54 Preferences ./Volume/Library/Preferences/ total 0 ./Volume/Library/Preferences/ drwxr-xr-x  2 root  admin  68 May  3 23:54 SystemConfiguration ./Volume/private/total 0 ./Volume/private/drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel  102 May  3 23:54 var ./Volume/private/var/total 0 ./Volume/private/var/drwxr-xr-x@ 2 root  wheel  68 May  3 23:54 db /code/pre  Looking into one of the for instance subfolders (Volume/Library/Preferences) is showing the following:  precodedrwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel   102B May  3 23:54 . drwxr-xr-x@ 3 root  wheel   102B May  3 23:54 ..     com.apple.backupdelta.MoveChecked      3B     com.apple.s stem.Security     68B  0: group:everyone deny delete drwxr-xr-x  2 root  admin    68B May  3 23:54 SystemConfiguration /code/pre  Running coderm -rf SystemConfiguration//code results in:  precoderm: SystemConfiguration/: Operation not permitted /code/pre  codechflags noschg SystemConfiguration//code is showing nothing.  codechmod 777 SystemConfiguration/code returns:  precodechmod 777 SystemConfiguration chmod: Unable to change file mode on SystemConfiguration: Operation not permitted /code/pre  I'm running all the above commands as sudoer.  If I try to delete SystemConfiguration from finder I'm getting this message:     “SystemConfiguration” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by OS X.   What am I doing wrong?  <comment290344> you need to prepend `sudo` when running `rm -rf`….or `chflags`…or `chmod` for your purposes <comment290345> Do try `sudo rm -rf [path to mobilebackups directory]` <comment290398> that was the first thing I did. I doesn’t work.
