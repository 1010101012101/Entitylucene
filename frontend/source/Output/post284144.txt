MacBook Air starts to heat up when turns on <body> My MacBook air begins to heat up everytime I its tur on, after few minutes the fan starts to become noisy, what can I do to solve this problem?  This is the screenshot of my activity monitor and console img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ck3rd.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UkJaM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer284157> The first thing I would do is reset the System Management Controller.  strongFor MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs, and MacBooks where you can’t remove the battery on your own (i.e. it's a built-in battery), here’s what you do:/strong  ol liShut down your MacBook Air/li liUnplug its power cable/li liFor 10 seconds, press and hold at the same time the kbdshift/kbdkbdcontrol/kbdkbdoption/kbd keys (on the strongleft/strong side of the strongbuilt-in/strong keyboard) strongemand/em/strong the kbdpower button/kbd/li liAfter 10 seconds let go of all keys and the power button /li liPlug in the power cable/li liSwitch your MacBook Air on with the power button/li /ol  Once you've done this, test to see if the problem is still present.

On the other hand, if the issue still occurs while in Safe Mode, I strongly suggest you test your hardware. Depending on the exact model of MacBook Air, you will either use Apple Hardware Test or Apple Diagnostics.  If your MacBook Air was introduced:  ul listrongbefore June 2013/strong, use strongApple Hardware Test/strong/li listrongafter June 2013/strong, use strongApple Diagnostics/strong/li /ul  Choose the appropriate process below.  strongRun Apple Hardware Test/strong  If your MBA uses Apple Hardware Test, follow these steps:  ol liShut down your MacBook Air /li liRestart your MacBook Air/li liPress and hold the kbdD/kbd key before the gray startup screen appears./li liAfter a while, Apple Hardware Test (AHT) will start./li liWhen prompted, select your language and click the right arrow. /li liWhen the AHT console appears, you can choose to run Basic tests by clicking the Test button.

Take a note of the results and report back.   strongNote 2:/strong If pressing and holding the kbdD/kbd key at Step 3 doesn't work, start again at Step 1 and, at Step 3 press and hold both the kbdOption/kbdkbdD/kbd keys instead.

Regardless, take a note of what happens and let me know how you went.  strong[UPDATE]/strong  Now that we've established the issue doesn't occur while you're booted into Safe Mode, we know that your hardware is okay. This means the problem is essentially software related.  I would now check what you have listed in your Login Items. To do this:  ol liGo to Apple  System Preferences  Users &amp; Groups/li liMake sure your User Account is selected at top left/li liClick on the Login Items tab/li liMake a note (or take a screenshot) of what items you have listed there/li liNow remove each of the items by clicking on their name (so they're highlighted) and then clicking on the minus kbd-/kbd button/li liOnce all items are removed, exit System Preferences/li liRestart your Mac/li liTest to see if the problem still persists/li liIf the problem persists, stop here and let me know. If the problem has gone away, continue below/li liRepeat Steps 1 to 3/li liClick on the plus kbd+/kbd button to add strongone/strong of the items back/li liExit System Preferences/li liRestart your Mac/li /ol  If the problem returns, repeat Steps 1 to 3 and then remove the item again. If the problem didn't return, start again at Step 10. Continue this process until you identify the item(s) that cause the problem.  <comment358309> I have an MBA that does the same thing when I am in a very hot environment; this is normal behavior.  To better answer you question, you need to provide details like what's the ambient temperature, when do the symptoms occur - all the time or just certain times and especially,  what version of macOS you are running. <comment358401> While I would still try the options in my answer, @Allan does have an excellent point. You can refer to the [Intel Mac Temperature Database](https://www.intelmactemp.com/list) to get a sense of the various temperatures that Macs can run at. For MBAs they're typically in the range of 40º C (104º F) to 100º C (219º F). However, if you have a faulty sensor, your MBA could be triggering the fans because the system _thinks_ it's overheating when it's not. That's why testing the hardware is a good troubleshooting step if resetting the SMC doesn't change things. <comment358440> Well, it happens everytime I turns on my MBA and my average temperature is around 27° Celcius <comment358441> Nothing happen in the safe mode but after I restart my MBA the issue came back. Tried Apple Diagnostics and it said there is no issue found <comment358442> Well, that's a good thing! :) If it doesn't happen in Safe Mode that means your hardware is okay and that the problem is essentially software related. I've updated my answer with what you now need to do. <comment358554> Removed all of them but the problem still returns :(
