Can a Mac's model year be determined with a Terminal Command? <body> Does anybody know a terminal command that gives me the model of my Mac?   For example -  "MacBook Pro, Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2013" or "MacBook Pro, Late 2009" or "Mac Mini, Early 2010".  That information does not exist in the SystemProfiler (code/usr/sbin/system_profiler SPHardwareDataType/code), but in OS X 10.7 and OS X 10.8 you can see that information when you click "More Info..." in the "About This Mac" window.  <answer98083> This should do it:br  precodesystem_profiler | more sw_vers scutil --get ComputerName sw_vers | awk -F':\t' '{print $2}' | paste -d ' ' - - - sysctl -n hw.memsize | awk '{print $0/1073741824" GB RAM"}' sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string /code/pre  Other References  <answer98086> You can use the command  precodesystem_profiler | grep "Model Identifier" /code/pre  in Terminal to get the model ID of your machine.br Then you can enter that ID on this site which will list the month and year the particular model was launched.  h2Edit:/h2  As mentioned in the comments below, the following command is much faster:  precodesysctl hw.model /code/pre  <answer98089> You can indirectly get this information from a web page and the curl command.  Depending on if your serial numer is 11 or 12 characters long take the last 3 or 4 characters, respectively, and feed that to the following URL after the strong?cc=XXXX/strong part. If your serial number was 12 character and ended in DJWR, you would issue this command:  precodecurl http://support-sp.apple.com/sp/product?cc=DJWR /code/pre  To get your serial number, use the following command:  precodesystem_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/Serial/ {print $4}' /code/pre  Thus, you could have a complicated command to query the internet if you need a single command:  precodecurl http://support-sp.apple.com/sp/product?cc=`system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/Serial/ {print $4}' | cut -c 9-` /code/pre  and then run the output of that through sed to cut to the key part  precodecurl -s http://support-sp.apple.com/sp/product?cc=`system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | awk '/Serial/ {print $4}' | cut -c 9-` |     sed 's|.*&lt;configCode&gt;\(.*\)&lt;/configCode&gt;.*|\1|' /code/pre  There used to be a private library file with these mappings so you could consult it offline, but I noticed it was gone as of 10.8.3 (and perhaps earlier) so the above trick is the only one I know that works on the current OS without third party libraries.   Some nice third party libararies provide a look up of this:  ul lipython code https://github.com/MagerValp/MacModelShelf/li liJSON mapping https://github.com/krypted/swiftwarrantylookup/blob/master/src/swiftMacWarranty/model_snippets.json/li /ul  <answer98151> Download Macktracker, An app for Osx avalable for iOS.  http://mactracker.ca/  You Will get all info your need ...  <answer255897> On El Capitan and Sierra, there's a plist file in a private framework with a dict of info for each model identifier; that dict includes the marketing name (which has the model year in it).  I don't know what OS version that particular file came in with, but it's NOT on Snow Leopard (the only thing I have that's older than El Capitan).  precode#! /bin/ksh if [ -f /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ServerInformation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/SIMachineAttributes.plist ] then     marketingModel="$(modelid="$(system_profiler SPHardwareDataType 2&gt;/dev/null|awk '/Model Identifier:/ {print $NF}')"     defaults read /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/ServerInformation.framework/Versions/A/Resources/English.lproj/SIMachineAttributes.plist "MacBookPro12,1"|sed -n -e 's/\\//g' -e 's/.*marketingModel = "\(.*\)";/\1/p')"     echo "${marketingModel}" else     echo "can't use offline method to find marketing name on this OS version" fi /code/pre  So, you could use that (or other similar tricks for other OS versions after checking the OS version, if you know those tricks, which I don't), and if that wasn't applicable, you could always fall back to the approach that requires Internet access.  This is not exactly the same as what About This Mac shows, which in my case isbr MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015)br while this showsbr 13" MacBook Pro with Retina display (Early 2015)br but in human-readable terms, I think it's close enough.   <comment115092> None of the commands you've listed do what the question asker asks. <comment115093> I don't think there exists a command to identify a Mac as "Late 2009" directly. However it can be derived from the Model Identifier, see my answer for an explanation. What do you mean by the `But in OS X 10.7 and 10.8...` sentence? When I look in the About This Mac window I don't see anything that states Late 2009 or something similar. <comment115096> @BartArondson - on 10.8 the screen for About this Mac shows Mac Mini on one line then Late 2012 on the next <comment115099> Ah I see it now. It's when you click on `About This Mac` and then on `More Info...`. I have no clue on how to get that information in your terminal. <comment115105> `system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Model Identifier"` runs much faster than the full profiler, but still doesn't return the marketing name as the OP asked. See my answer for a command that works around the "look up" portion of your answer in a terminal friendly manner. <comment115106> Your answer would be spot on for http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/40243/how-can-i-find-the-serial-number-on-a-mac-programmatically-from-the-terminal however ;-) <comment115115> One more question. If I put the last option you gave me in terminal I get this: ?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?rootnameCPU Name/nameconfigCodeiMac (27-inch, Late 2009)/configCodelocaleen_US/locale/root". Is it possible to just get "(27-inch, Late 2009)"?  Tanks:P <comment115116> So, does the More Info screen (the one the OP mentions) get its information from an on-line database? Isn't the marketing name stored locally somewhere if it's displayed there? <comment115119> I think it is on a database. But in my case it's not a problem:P But if I can get it without internet it would be great of course. But if I only can get the text "(27-inch, Late 2009)" that would be great! Regards <comment115120> My guess is the system caches it during registration or there is a private internal SDK for getting the information. It used to be in the private framework ServerKit - so it's clearly undocumented and has already changed. I know Mac can show the information without an internet connection - but I don't really know if it's cached or determined at install time and hard coded. <comment115126> I boot from a external hard drive to different computers everyday. And I run different commands in geek tool that gives me information about the mac I currently work on. To have that information via a terminal command save me alot of time. :P <comment115133> @bmike the information your command (the last one) gives in terminal is what I am looking for. It gives me the information about the mac. But it would be great if the command somehow cold give only what I need. And that is (on my current computer) "(27-inch, Late 2009)". I hope you understand me:D <comment115207> Hello and welcome to Apple.SE. Could you maybe explain how this app will help the OP *use the Terminal* to determine the model number, as that is what the OP asks? <comment115234> I don't get XML when I run the command as a shell script (see https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/6171647). If you do, you can try this variant: https://gist.github.com/tjluoma/6171672 <comment115256> TJ Luoma@ You solved it! Thanks so much! I just copy your script and put it into GeekTool and it works great! thanks:D:D <comment115299> I made a slightly-less-quick-and-dirty script to accomplish this in Python, using XML parsers: https://gist.github.com/zigg/6174270 <comment169475> For the same output, `sysctl hw.model` is faster than the above command. <comment282765> What is support-sp?  An API especially for System Profiler? <comment317521> Similar to using `sysctl -n hw.model` mentioned below, `ioreg -c IOPlatformExpertDevice -d 2 | awk -F\" '/IOPlatformSerialNumber/{print $(NF-1)}'` will work faster for getting the serial number. <comment369978> Is there a way to display the EMC number as well?
