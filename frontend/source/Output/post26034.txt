Remove desktop folder which is on the desktop and contains everything on the desktop <body> I don't how this happend, but I feel like my machine is experiencing a emBeing John Malkovich/em syndrome.  There is a folder on my Desktop called Desktop which contains all the other folders on my Desktop. I want to get rid of this folder, but not the contents of my desktop.   Any advice?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2VrQA.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer26035> Open the folder. Select All. Copy. Click on the Desktop. Paste. Delete the folder.  <answer26046> You may have to check using the Terminal command ls -ld for whether you have a directory containing a soft symlink to itself.  If so, you can just delete the symlink.  <comment29802> Select then Drag is probably easier and less error prone. <comment29803> I miss targets too often when dragging. Particular with the three-finger drag gesture on my MacBook Air. But to each his own... <comment29832> You miss the **desktop**? you might want to get that checked out :) <comment29851> Seriously, yes -- sometimes I hit an open window or the Dock instead.
