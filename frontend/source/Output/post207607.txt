Java update fails every time <body> Every time I install Java updates, I get the following error after the download completes:     strongUpdate Error!/strong      An error occurred while downloading the update. Please try again later.   How can I fix this? Things I've already tried:  ul liInstalling the update from the website. The error just comes back with the next update and I do not want to install all of these manually./li liRunning codesudo /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Resources/Java Updater.app/Contents/MacOS/Java Updater/code on the command line./li /ul  img src="https://imgur.com/vMow6xT.png" alt="Screenshot"  <comment250464> What is the URL you used on the website? <comment250535> It has been a while since I did the manual install, but if my browser's internet history is accurate I used http://java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp. <comment250542> That is the JRE I suspect you want the JDK <comment250580> Why should I get the Development Kit when I only want to run - not develop - Java software? <comment250581> Because Oracle messed it up <comment353953> Same problem here.
