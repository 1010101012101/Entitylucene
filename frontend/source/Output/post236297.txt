Can I update my iPad to 9.3.1? <body> Can I update my iPad if it hasn't been done for a couple of years to 9.3.1? I haven't updated in a long time and it's currently at 7.1.2.  <answer236312> From the description of your iPad, I think it's no need to update your iPad, although you updated your iPad to latest version,  There may 2 problems:  ol liSome new feature of iOS you can't use because of your iPad hardware limited/li liThe latest version of iOS will slow down your interact with your iPad/li /ol  But you still can try it. Actually when you update your iPad the software of apple will tell you whether your device can update.  <answer236477> It's not the same as your but I have tried mine just few days back... it's iOS 8 and iPad3.  It was okay but had to be connected to iTunes (USB).  Over the air had problems. Using non-original cables will also cause issues (my previous experiences).  Just make sure you make a backup as there is a big chance it will fail and you have no choice but to restore from backup which will first update your iPad to the latest OS then re-download the software and data.  <answer272331> Yes, you can, depending upon your iPad model.
