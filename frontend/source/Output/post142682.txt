Target Display Mode: how to automate and persist on closing laptop <body> I have connected my MacBook (Early 2013, OS X 10.9.4) with my iMac (Late 2012, 27 inch, OS X 10.9.4) via a ThunderBolt cable in order to use the iMac screen with my MacBook.  I have two related questions:  (i) Is there a way to automatically mirror the screen without needing to press Command-F2?  (ii) How can I allow screen mirroring to persist when I close my MacBook?  <comment168220> When you say, "How can I allow screen mirroring to persist when I close my MacBook?", do you mean to move the desktop onto the iMac, or to automatically mirror it when you open the screen again? <comment168341> I mean the former: to move the desktop to the iMac.
