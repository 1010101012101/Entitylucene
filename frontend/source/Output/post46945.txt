Time Capsule and multiple Macs <body> Does the Time Capule support Time Machine backups from multiple macs out of the box?  <answer46946> Yes. Each Mac get's it's own sparse bundle disk image.  <answer46955> And to support gentmatt's answer, here is the official documentation of Apple:   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0g6O.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment53737> /me acting dumb. What's a sparse bundle disk image? <comment53738> @StuWilson It's an **automatically expanding** disk image which is stored and updated in little **"fragments"**. That way only updated fragments have to be backed up and not the whole image. Because it's automatically expanding, the image takes up only little space when created - it expands as files are added. <comment53745> @gentmatt - If "a little space" is ~20 GB, then you are correct. The initial backup will be the size of a complete install of OS X. <comment53747> If you create your own new sparse bundle disk image using Disk Utility, you will see that it's not that big. E.g. I've created a 1 TB sparse bundle with an initial size of less than 1GB. That's less than 0.1% of the maximum size which the bundle can hold.
