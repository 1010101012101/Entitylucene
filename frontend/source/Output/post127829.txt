How can I force Safari to Save As webpage? <body> Sometimes, you can't save the page you want (actually I don't know why this happens). How can I force the Safari to strongSave As/strong?  URL:What features of Mavericks are beneficial to you?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pLTcl.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer127863> Don't know the reason and don't reproduce the problem. But according to this question you should be able to override this by clicking on option at the same time.  <answer127879> If others are trying to save an audio or video file that is opened directly in a tab, try to focus the location bar and press option-return.  If you open an audio or video file in Safari, select Save As, and set the format to Page Source, Safari just saves an empty file.  <answer216567> This can happen when the page hasn't actually finished loading.  Try pressing command-[period] to stop it loading, then try saving the page.  <comment149778> do you have an example of a URL where you have the problem? <comment149787> @LaurentBristiel Question has been edited. <comment149791> hmm, interesting...do you have a JS setting that would prevent that ? (javaScript) <comment149816> that worked for me. Save As... was greyed out unless I held option. <comment149817> Actually you don’t have to hold `Option` in order to use `Save As`. It’s greyed out because you haven’t focused the cursor to the page. `Command+S` should probably work without using `Option` too.
