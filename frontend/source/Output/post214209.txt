How can I install Windows 10 64-bit in El Capitan Boot Camp? <body> I'm running OS X El Capitan 10.11.1 on an early 2015 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro (MacBookPro12,1) with Boot Camp Assistant 6.0.0 (519).  I have downloaded emWin10_EnglishInternational_x64.iso/em from Microsoft.   When I select this ISO and click Install in Boot Camp Assistent I am presented with the message below and I'm not able to continue.     strongNeed 64-bit Windows 8 or later ISO file./strong      Boot Camp only supports 64-bit Windows 8 or later installation on this platform. Please use an ISO file for 64-bit Windows 8 or later installation.   What do I need to do/change/download for Boot Camp Assistant to accept Microsoft's official Windows 10 ISO as a valid "64-bit Windows 8 or later ISO file"  I also tried emen_windows_10_multiple_editions_x64_dvd_6846432.iso/em that I can download from MSDN as a subscriber. This ISO file is also not accepted by Boot Camp Assistant.  <answer214210> Boot Camp Assistant accepts emWin10_SingleLang_EnglishInternational_x64.iso/em  <answer220042> I think because you download an iso and mounted it (open it) and that silly error pop out. I just unmount and it's work  <comment288749> To clarify: from the [windows download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO) under `Select Edition` you have to select the single language version. It will give you this message if you download the generic `Windows 10` edition, instead of the `Windows 10 Single Language` edition. <comment291078> This is the right answer in my case <comment293496> I don't have the cred to be able to answer on here, but you're likely using Chrome to download the ISO.  It has issues.  Download the iso with Safari and it will work. <comment293737> you rock man!!! <comment293738> unmounting the disk worked :)
