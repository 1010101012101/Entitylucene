Is it possible to "un-lose" an iPad sync configuration in iTunes? <body> This morning, when I went to sync my iPad 2, iTunes appeared to have forgotten its existence (apart from, as I discovered on examining the restore option, a couple of older backups), and wanted to set it up as a new device.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any way around that, and so now when it wants to sync, it wants to erase all apps and start from scratch, etc., etc.  Well, I've got hundreds of apps on the thing, many of them with data, and considering how long it took to get them all set up the way I like 'em, my enthusiasm for redoing all of that is, shall we say, emnot/em.  So, is there any way to persuade iTunes that the configuration on the iPad is definitive, or otherwise to avoid having to reconfigure everything, short of never syncing again?
