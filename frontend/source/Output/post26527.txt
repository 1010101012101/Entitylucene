Can you let Preview (the app) cycle through anything? <body> This is related to this question:  How to start a slideshow on the Mac super quick and easy?  Basically, I wonder why even in Snow Leopard, I double click on a photo in Finder, and Preview will show that photo, but no arrow key can let me see the next photo in the folder?   Is there a way at all?  Or will the next version of Mac OS X add it, I wonder -- is it that counter-intuitive to show the next one?  <answer26529> As more or less already answered in the question you linked to, you can get the effect you want by   ol liselecting the first file, pressing kbdSpace/kbd to open Quick Look and use the cursor key to jump to the next one/li liselecting all the relevant files (pictures) and pressing kbdSpace/kbd to enter Quick Look/li liselecting all the relevant files (pictures) and pressing kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbdO/kbd to open them in one Preview window/li licommand-doubleclicking the folder containing the pictures to open a new finder window followed by kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd4/kbd to switch the new window to Coverflow mode/li licommand-doubleclicking the folder containing the pictures to open a new finder window followed by kbd&#x2318;/kbd+kbd3/kbd to switch the new window to Column mode and just step through the files to get the content displyed in preview mode in the last column./li /ol  Given the different options already available to get the desired result, do we really need another one?  PS: Technically speaking, Preview.app is just an application able to display pictures and PDFs. It doesn't know anything about a emnext/em file in a folder.  <comment39648> 1.) is wrong. Cursor keys only work on the same line. In icon mode, they would stop working after 3-4 pics. 2 and 3) require explicit selection of all pictures. 4 and 5) are just ridiculously convoluted. Not to mention both would only show you a slightly bigger thumbnail (or maybe even smaller depending on settings) than the icon view thumbnails. So yes, another method IS necessary
