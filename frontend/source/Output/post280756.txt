Batch Process - Applescript with embedded Shell (FFMPEG) <body> I have a great little Automator App that makes use of AppleScript with an embedded shell of FFMPEG to convert files.  It's great to be able to drag and drop files and they all convert...but they all convert at the same time.  I'm having a hard time finding a solution to get the app to batch.  I'm sure it's a simple matter of AppleScript language.  I want to be able to drop a folder or a bunch of files onto the app and have them process one at a time. Right now I have:  precodeon remove_extension(this_name)     if this_name contains "." then         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string         set x to the offset of "." in this_name         set this_name to (text (x + 1) thru -1 of this_name)         set this_name to (the reverse of every character of this_name) as string     end if     return this_name end remove_extension  on run {input, parameters}     repeat with file_ in input         tell application "System Events"             set inputFilename to name of (get properties of file_)         end tell         set inputFilePath to quoted form of (POSIX path of file_)         set outputFilePath to quoted form of (my remove_extension(POSIX path of file_) &amp; "1.mov")         tell application "Terminal"             activate             do script "/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/3.2.1/bin/ffmpeg -i " &amp; inputFilePath &amp; " -acodec copy -vcodec copy " &amp; outputFilePath         end tell     end repeat     return input end run /code/pre  It works very well and I'm happy with it although I'm sure there are other ways of doing this I just need to help adapting this app to batch files.  Thank you for your help.  If it helps to know I'm running on OS X Yosemite and FFMPEG 3.2.1 (as shown above.)  <comment353160> Related: [Waiting for do shell script to finish](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20146093/waiting-for-do-shell-script-to-finish) or [Have a script wait until the last script is complete](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17216270/have-a-script-wait-until-the-last-script-is-complete) <comment353163> `do shell script` actually *should* wait until the issued command completes, see "Other Concerns" in https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2065/_index.html <comment371858> [Have a script wait until the last script is complete](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17216270/have-a-script-wait-until-the-last-script-is-complete) article helped a lot but the portion of the script that has Terminal open and run FFMPEG doesn't seem to occur. Rather is runs as the batching should but in the background. It's useful to my process to watch the progress of the file conversion. Is there a way to do both: have the batching AND watch Terminal progress?
