Open the same terminal without switching spaces <body> I'm looking for an AppleScript (or anything, really) that will do the following:  ul liIf a Terminal window is open in the current space, bring it to the front./li liIf not, open a new one in the current space./li /ul  I don't want it to switch to another space if a Terminal window happens to be open there.  Using iTerm2 instead of Terminal is fine, if that makes things easier :).  I've been looking around for scripts that do this, but the closest I could find is one that opens a new Terminal every time. I don't want that, because I probably have a session that I want to return to.  <answer231623> I've been working at this for a while, and controlling spaces–with or without GUI scripting, which I don't use since it's inelegant and breaks–is really hard. AppleScript lacks functions needed to properly control spaces. What can be hacked together through shell scripts and writing to/from files can't even do what's needed.  Here's what I could manage:  precodetell application "Terminal"     if not application "Terminal" is running then         activate     else         if (exists window 1) then             activate         else             do script ""             activate         end if     end if end tell /code/pre  This script does:  ul liIf a Terminal window is open, bring it to the front./li liIf not, open a new one in the current space./li /ul  It does not:  ul liCheck only within the current space when testing for an open window/li /ul  <comment282622> I've been working at this for a while, and controlling spaces–with or without GUI scripting, which I don't use since it's inelegant and breaks–is really hard.

Here's what I have so far:       tell application "Terminal"      if not application "Terminal" is running then       activate      else       if (exists window 1) then        activate       else        do script ""        activate       end if      end if     end tell <comment282751> So basically, once my Terminal windows are already open, it does what I want, except I have to open them myself. That's acceptable for me. If you turn this into a proper answer, I'll give you the bounty! <comment282865> Actually, it should open them as appropriate. It doesn't like spaces so much though. <comment282885> Why not assigning the Terminal to all Spaces? With this You can activate the Terminal without switching Spaces. I've assigned the shortcut to activate the Terminal and if it's already activated hide it ( like ⌘H). With this  I have some kind of Visor Window (similar to Total Terminal). <comment282888> @MateuszSzlosek I guess that would help too, but I tend to work on multiple projects simultaneously (one per space) and it's nice to jump directly into the session that belongs to that project/space without having to switch tabs or anything.
