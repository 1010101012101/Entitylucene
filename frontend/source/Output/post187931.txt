How can I add a UTC world clock to my OSX dashboard? <body> In the OSX dashboard, the world clock doesn't have a UTC option. Choosing London only works half of the year (the other half London is on Daylight Savings Time and is UTC+1).  I could choose Atlantic/Reykjavik, which is always on UTC, but it seems like a hack, and I'd rather have my clock display "UTC" instead of "Reykjavik".  <answer187932> You can edit the source of the world clock widget to add UTC (or name it whatever you prefer):  precodecd /Library/Widgets sudo vi WorldClock.js /code/pre  Then, in the Europe section, add the line:  precode{city:'UTC', offset:0, timezone:'UTC', id:"2647937"}, /code/pre  You may need to remove and recreate any existing clocks in your dashboard for UTC to show up in the list.  <answer197344> There is already a UTC clock available.  Assuming you're on Yosemite:   ol liGo to your notification center  /li liClick Edit at the bottom  /li liAdd the World Clock and click Done.  /li liHover over the World Clock you just added, and click on the (i) icon.  /li liEnter UTC when it asks for City.   /li liThat's it. You're done.  /li /ol  <comment222323> This seems like a hack too: UTC shouldn't be a "city". <comment321004> Just to update, on Mac OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan, the file `WorldClock.js` is in `/Library/Widgets/World Clock.wdgt/`. <comment322261> Just to update, on Sierra UTC already exists. No need to hack.
