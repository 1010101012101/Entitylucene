How to modify Hardware UUID of a macOS Sierra Virtual machine in VMware fusion/parallel desktop <body> I've got to have different Hardware UUID for software testing purposes. When cloning a VM in Fusion pro 8.5, the clone gets a new MAC adress but the hardware  UUID in system report in macOS doesn't change.  Any idea how I can achieve this ?
