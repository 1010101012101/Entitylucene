applescript to unlock mac works very slow <body> Hello i am using this script to unlock the mac  precodetell me to activate\n tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"PASSWORD\"\n  tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return\n  tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke return" /code/pre  the problem is it is very very slow and it take time between 3-10 seconds  randomly to unlock the MAC. i want to do it in 1-2 seconds.i have search a lot but didnt find any good script if any one know please guide me what i am doing wrong here.  <answer180358> I'm parking this here as a placeholder so I don't forget what I wrote - still needs clarification from the OP  To tidy up your existing script - you don't need to tell 'me' to activate, it already must be frontmost to work at all.  precode    tell application "System Events"         keystroke "PASSWORD"         keystroke return         keystroke return     end tell /code/pre  To do it from scratch, though idk how you would call this before login  precode    tell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow" to entire contents      tell application "System Events" to tell process "loginwindow"         tell window "Login Panel"             if name of static text 1 is "username" then                 set value of text field 1 to "password"                 keystroke return             end if         end tell     end tell /code/pre  <comment214195> The code as written does not compile!
