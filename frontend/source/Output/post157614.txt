How to send/receive iPhone messages on iPod touch after having cancelled code confirmation once? <body> I recently got an iPhone. I already had an iPod touch, and used to use iMessages on it with my Apple ID(email only). Now that I went into iMessage on the iPod today, for the first time after setting up my iPhone with the same apple ID- I got a notification asking if I'd like to send and receive text messages on the iPod using my iPhone. It then gave a confirmation code and asked to enter it on the iPhone. I cancelled it on the iPhone, thinking I don't need having my iPhone messages on the iPod.  But now, I can think of several cases where this might be useful. Can someone please point a way where I can set this up again? I tried logging in and out of iMessage on the iPod, it said "waiting for activation" for a second, and then imessage was back on. However, I didn't get any confirmation prompt(like the last time) so far.   Many thanks!  <comment185340> Check out Settings - Messages - Text Message Forwarding on your iPhone.
