Macbook Air (2011) WIFI Issue <body> After working perfectly for the past 1.5 years I have had my 13" MBA, I suddenly had WIFI issues. Let me give a few details about my experience:   I suddenly had issues connecting to the internet (I was able to connect to the wifi, but could not load a webpage in less than 2-3 minutes if/when it loaded) at my home, but had no issues when connecting directly to my modem via an ethernet cable - thus, it was not a network card issue or an issue with my internet provider.   After that, I had suddenly begun having issues connecting to the networks at my office and school...which is when I began to get frustrated.   See my answer below for how I resolved this issue.   <answer89149> After having issues with my home, office, and school networks (i.e. all networks I tried connecting to), I realized that the only thing these networks all had in common (besides my computer) was that they were all secured networks.   When I tried connecting to an open network, I had no issues at all - thus my realization that some settings on my MBA got screwed up somehow, and the security authorization was screwing things up.   Resolution: To do a hard reset on your WIFI settings, go into Macintosh HD - Library - Preferences (see screenshot below). Remove the SystemConfiguration  folder (place it on your Desktop for now). Reboot your MBA.  At this point, I had no issues connecting to any WIFI networks - I hope you have the same result.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ACXAJ.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer126489> Instead of removing the whole SystemConfiguration folder, just do the following:     ol   liTurn your Wi-Fi off/li   liOpen Finder window/li   liPress Command+Shift+G/li   liEnter "/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/" and hit enter/li   liDelete the following files (   strongcom.apple.airport.preferences.plist/strong,   strongcom.apple.network.identification.plist/strong,   strongNetworkInterfaces.plist/strong,   strongpreferences.plist/strong)/li   liEmpty the trash/li   liReboot your Mac/li   liTurn Wi-Fi back on again/li   /ol   <comment148183> Removing the whole SystemConfiguration folder is a bit heavy... Just remove the files that you needed to remove. You are "resetting" more than you need/should.
