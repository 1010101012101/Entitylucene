How can I log in to ICQ using Messages? <body> It used to be possible to log in to ICQ accounts with iChat by using your ICQ login info as an AIM account. However, that functionality seems to have been removed - if memory serves, with the introduction of Lion.  Is there any way to use ICQ with Messages under Mountain Lion?  <answer54401> Setting Server to login.icq.com and Port to 5190, unchecking SSL in Server Settings tab should help.  Add:  Enter only the first eight characters of your password, leaving off any extras.  This consistently worked for me.  I use OSX 10.9 Mavericks and Messages.  Some have had results leaving the last character off their password.  <comment62265> This used to work, but it doesn't seem to anymore under Lion. :( <comment84708> Maybe try a 3rd party app like Adium? <comment168327> I've got it working under Yosemite. :-D Thanks for the settings!
