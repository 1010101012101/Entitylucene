how to set 'arrange by' for all the folders in the finder <body> In finder, we can 'arrange by' for each folder separately, but how to set these settings for all folders.  NOTE: i have tried 'Use as defaults' in info dialog but of no use   <answer23894> Unfortunately, I don't know of any scripts that can arrange all files in EVERY folder by name, or scripts to keep the folders at the top, but you can sort your files by type (extensions, alphabetically), and by name through right clicking (Control-click) in your folder (not selecting any specific file), and select Clean up by - Kind or Name.  <answer23918> You can use TotalFinder to do this.  <answer23919> To answer your first question, this isn't a script, but it is a procedure you can follow to make all Finder windows sorted by name. Open a finder window. Press Command-J. In the Sort By box, select "Name". Click "Use as defaults"  For the second, no, "sort by" sorts everything, including folders. If there are particular files or folders you want at the top of the list, you could start their name with a space, but don't do that to folders that applications or the system expect to have particular names. It does work for folders you create within your own Documents directory, however.   <answer251483> ul liGo to a folder that should be arranged by Name. /li liOpen "View Options" with âŒ˜+J. /li liSelect "Arrange by Name"./li liSelect "Use as Defaults" to make it default to all folders./li /ul  <comment26383> +1 - I have exactly the same question. <comment26712> Does it have to be a script? <comment317540> "Use as Defaults" does not apply to "Arrange by". <comment329409> Sweet. $12 to "Arrange By" defaults!
