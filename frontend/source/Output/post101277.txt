iPad initial Set-up cannot complete activation <body> My dad has the original iPad (Model A1337) and I did a reformat because there was a lot of clutter. It takes me back to the original set-up screen but after setting up my Wi-Fi and initial settings it says Cannot complete activation.  I connected it to iTunes and it had the same problem. I put the iPad in DFU mode, did a restore to the latest public version and it still didn't seem to work. I was wondering if anyone knew what the issue might be? When I did the system restore, it connected to the Apple servers just fine to get the software update so I don't think it is a connection issue.  If anyone has any idea or solutions for this, that'd be awesome. I'll also post an answer if I get to it because I can see this being a common problem. (I saw a lot of threads on the complete activation and the solutions I tried, specifically running in DFU mode, didn't work)
