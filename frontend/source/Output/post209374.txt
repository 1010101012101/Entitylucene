What is alfUIplugin.plugin? <body> I'm cleaning old 3rd-party stuff out of my /System/* subdirectories on 10.11. And I noticed in /System/Library/UserEventPlugins/ the following file: strongalfUIplugin.plugin/strong. The file size is emzero bytes!/em And the date modified is in 2012, three years ago; surely it's not part of El Capitan. Right?  I can safely delete this...right?  <answer209405> From Apple Support :         I was chasing this down myself. It looks like this   plugin is used for ALF - Application Level Firewall. ... like the   System Preferences/security setting/firewall possibly.   _     I too am seeing those errors after updating to Mavericks on my MacBook   Pro.  And, I cannot find any info on what alfUIplugin.plugin is   either.  However, upon going to /System/Library/UserEventPlugins   folder, I noticed that the plugin file is 0KB.  On my Mac Pro, which   is still running Mountain Lion, it is 20KB and on Snow Leopard it's   like 50KB.   https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5505336  <comment252574> I guess if it's zero bytes, it can't possibly be doing any harm... weird. <comment252575> And if it's zero bytes, why do you absolutely want to delete it ? ^^ <comment252582> How can you delete something that does not exist? That's what I don't understand. Zero bytes would indicate that there are literally no sectors on disk occupied by the file. So how does the file system even know that it's there? I am reminded of the old radio plays, [The Shadow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow). <comment252583> In fact, the file name is stored by the file system ;) <comment255281> Yet another thing I hate about operating systems. Files should be self contained.
