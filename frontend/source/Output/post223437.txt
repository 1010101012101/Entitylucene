Make OS X El Capitan announce time only when screen is unlocked or during night time <body> I use the incredibly useful feature on OS X to announce time on the hour for my time management by checking the option in Date &amp; Time preferences.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ewjQn.png" alt="OS X Date &amp; Time"  However, the time announcements keep going on during the night unless I shutdown my iMac (which I don't want to). Is there a way to silence it during night time or to make it not announce time when the screen is locked?   I know there was a related question for OS X Lion but posting this to see if there is a better/different solution for El Capitan.  <answer223449> Do you have 'Do Not Distrub' mode set on? Go to System Preferences - Notifications and set up as needed.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zBdCO.png" alt="enter image description here"
