How do I add IRCTC tickets to iPhone Wallet <body> I am residing in India. I have iPhone 5s running 9.3.2 I would like to add IRCTC tickets to iPhone Wallet. How do I add them ?  <answer246861> You can either get Indian Railway PNR &amp; IRCTC Info or Rail Pass™ - IRCTC PNR status enquiry. Add Indian Railway train ticket to Passbook using RailPass.  Then book the ticket and use the PNR to generate pass [for Wallet] using these apps. Once the pass is generated, you can add it from there itself.  I personally prefer Rail Pass™, as it is slick, fast and bug free. More over it doesn't irritate us with ads.   <comment293158> Does this help? If it does, I'll make it an answer. Apparently it converts then stores the tickets into iPhone Wallet https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/rail-pass-irctc-pnr-status/id902487234?mt=8 <comment293167> From the screen shots, I believe post PNR search, ticket gets added to the wallet. PNR search doesnot work for me :(
