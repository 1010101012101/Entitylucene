How to test and debug website on older version of Safari <body> We're trying to test and debug Safari 7. I've used the Safari dev tools to connect to a physical device and use the inspector to view the page. That works fine, but I don't have access to a physical device with Safari 7. Tools like Browser stack or saucelabs I can see the issues, but I can't debug in an emulator. Does anyone have a solution to this?  <answer250616> Very easy.  Get a copy of Parallels or VMware Fusion. Set up a virtual machine and install Mavericks on it. You will then have all the benefits of running Safari 7 in the original environment without having to dust the hardware.  I have Fusion, and virtual machines back to 10.5 Leopard. Also have Windows back to W98, and DOS 6 just for Duke Nukem in all it's 8-bit glory. modern.ie has free downloads of ready-to-go virtual machines for all versions of MSIE.  Other things you should have:  ul liemlots/em of disk space. Like  250GB/li liemlots/em of memory. VMs don't share memory, they need their own. I have 24GB./li lia big monitor, or a second monitor. /li /ul
