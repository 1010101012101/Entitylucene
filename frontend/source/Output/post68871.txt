What is the function of each of the system location services in iOS 6? <body> I'd like to know what functionality I gain or lose by enabling / deactivating each of the services under Settings  Privacy  Location Services  System Services.  Some incomplete information is provided here and here and here and here, but not enough to make an informed decision regarding which services to enable (and the link that promises more info at the end of the last link is dead).
