How can I erase the data from my Macbook without losing my recent OS? <body> I'm going to sell my Macbook Pro and want to remove all of the data before doing so. I have the OS Lion installed but my machine came with Snow Leopard. How can I remove everything and restore it to basically just the OS without losing Lion? I want to sell the machine with Lion. Thanks.  <answer72815> Apple provides instructions on erasing and reinstalling OS X, so the system will be as it was when it came from the factory: http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4439  These instructions guide you through reformatting the drive and reinstalling OS X via Recovery.  <answer72843> You can reinstall like cablesm suggested and it will have Lion installed but you have to understand that you do strongNOT/strong sell Lion with it unless you have a bought Lion USB Stick cause Lion is hard bundled with strongYOUR/strong AppleID and you can not sell it or move it to another AppleID!  Therefore I would sell it with Snow Leopard preinstalled.   Here are instructions copied straight from http://support.apple.com/kb/PH6522  h3To erase and reinstall Mac OS X Snow Leopard:/h3  ul liInsert the Mac OS X installation disc into your computerâ€™s optical drive (or an optical drive connected to your computer), and then double-click the Install Mac OS X icon./li liIn the Installer, click Utilities, and then click Restart./li liWhen the Language Chooser appears, select your language, and then click the Continue button (looks like an arrow)./li liIn the Installer, choose Utilities  Disk Utility./li liSelect your startup disk from the list on the left, and then click the Erase tab./li liFrom the Format pop-up menu, select Mac OS Extended (Journaled), type a name for your disk, and then click Erase./li liAfter the disk has been erased, choose Disk Utility  Quit Disk Utility, and then follow the instructions in the Mac OS X Installer to reinstall Mac OS X./li /ul  <answer72927> You may also be able to take the Mac into the Apple store and have a Genius clean wipe and install up to the latest OS for you.  <comment84569> Will this preserve my current OS considering it wasn't what it came with from the factory? <comment84571> Yes, this will preserve Lion. The computer doesn't actually have your original OS on it any more, it just has Lion and a recovery partition to restore Lion.
