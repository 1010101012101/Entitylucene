Can I remove user's home directory folders? <body> I have the following scenario:  All of my files, documents etc. are saved on Copy.com.  I have installed copy on my MacBooc Air all my files went to the following directory:  precode/Users/username/Copy /Users/username/Copy/Documents /Users/username/Copy/Movies /Users/username/Copy/Pictures /Users/username/Copy/Music /Users/username/Copy/Workspace /code/pre  On my Mac's home folder, I want to replace the following folders with symlinks or aliases to the Copy ones:  precode/Users/username /Users/username/Documents (alias to /Users/username/Copy/Documents) /Users/username/Movies (alias to ...) /Users/username/Pictures (alias to ...) /Users/username/Music (alias to ...) /Users/username/Workspace (alias to ...) /code/pre  I have tried to delete a folder under code/Users/username/code and Mac prompts:     “Documents” can’t be modified or deleted because it’s required by OS X.   I have done this scenario on Ubuntu, that's why I want it on MacBook Air, too.  <answer144921> Finder will prevent you from deleting the default directories, but Terminal won't. You can use coderm -rf /path/to/directory/code to delete the folder then create the symlink normally.  <comment170710> That's possible, I've made something similiar on my machine. However You'll loose directory icons (for example in Finder left pane). There's also a posibility to change Your home folder location, would this be good for You? <comment170711> I found the answer to my question at:  http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/25947/90213
