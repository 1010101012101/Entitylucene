App installation stuck in paused state <body> I bought software from the App Store for my iMac and it was in the process of installing when my iMac restarted. I resumed installation of the app but it no longer shows the progress bar, it just keeps showing as paused.  How do I know if it is installing?  When I click on the item, it asks me to enter the Apple ID and password When I do that it allows me to install and it indicates installing after I click it, but previous downloads still remain paused.
