why isn't iMovie letting me save my video? <body> My sister and I have a YouTube channel, and I edited a video and wanted to save the video to my camera roll. However, I deleted it from my camera roll &amp; my recently deleted. Now I want to save it to my camera roll but iMovie won't even let me play it because it says that I'm missing files. Is there anyway I can recover these?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WV5PQ.png" alt="iMovie Screenshot"   <comment346798> Hello and welcome to Ask Different! I see that you're having a problem with iMovie... did you delete the video files that went in to the movie? (i.e. the videos that you added together) <comment346828> Yes I did!! Is there anyway I can get them back? <comment346849> Do you have a backup of your iPhone from _before_ you deleted the files? <comment346875> uhm.. How can I check that?
