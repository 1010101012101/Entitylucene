Is there an app to replace in bulk an area of a PDF with a preset image? <body> I have several PDF documents that follow the same template. In all of them there is an address that needs to be replaced with another. I'm looking for a way to do that in bulk and automagically.  <comment303154> I think something can be done with imagemagick as it supports PDF files but I'm far from knowing how to use it
