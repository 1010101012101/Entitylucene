Mac OS X 10.7 Window Shadow Params <body> I would like to create some Mac OS X 10.7 Windows "simulations" in Photoshop.   I would like to learn about the window's shadow parameters, like size, spread and distance.  Could anybody help me with this???  <answer127931> For Mac OS X standard windows use drop shadow with folowing parameters: black #000000 color with opacity 60%, angle 90º, distance 25px, size 50px, spread 0px.  <answer209480> Actually it's more of a combination of two drop shadows. These settings work well for me in direct comparison to the original shadow:  ul liDropshadow 1:  ul liOpacity: 47%/li liAngle: 90°   /li liDistance: 26px   /li liSpread: 0px   /li liSize: 43px /li /ul/li liDropshadow 2:     ul liOpacity: 44%   /li liAngle: 90°  /li liDistance: 0px   /li liSpread: 0px   /li liSize: 3px/li /ul/li /ul  The second drop shadow is for the fine darker line you notice around every window, especially when examining OS X window chrome on white background.  <comment85820> What version of Windows are you trying to simulate. <comment85849> Are you just asking about shadows? Or is there something more? <comment85958> I am not trying to simulate Windows, I am trying to simulate Mac OS shadows <comment85959> @bassplayer7 I am talking just about the shadows, I already have made the rest of the frame <comment229300> As of the latest OS X release I believe 50% opacity, 22px distance, and 45px size more closely approximate the drop shadow. For retina displays, 45px distance and 90px size.
