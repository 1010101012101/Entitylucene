Detect failed local login attempts <body> I'm using macOS Sierra and when I try to view failed login attempts, grep doesn't return any results because the keyword has probably changed or I'm looking in the wrong place. Does anyone know where/how to find these?  I've looked at similar questions but they are all out of date. The most recent post I found suggested trying these but neither produced any results.  precodegrep "Failed to authenticate user" /var/log/system.log grep "authentication error for" /var/log/system.log /code/pre  <answer274667> I found out the keyword to look for is codeAuthenticationAllowed/code.   Here is an example of a bad login:  precode2017-03-27 14:58:52.616248-0500  localhost com.apple.AccountPolicyHelper[226]: (78.701.2) AuthenticationAllowed completed: record "testuser", result: Success (0). 2017-03-27 14:58:52.616578-0500  localhost opendirectoryd[78]: Verify password result: 5000 2017-03-27 14:58:52.616620-0500  localhost opendirectoryd[78]: ODRecordVerifyPassword failed with error 'Invalid credentials' (5000) /code/pre  And this is a good login:  precode2017-03-27 15:02:33.444367-0500  localhost com.apple.AccountPolicyHelper[226]: (78.702.2) AuthenticationAllowed completed: record “otheruser", result: Success (0). 2017-03-27 15:02:33.444540-0500  localhost opendirectoryd[78]: ODRecordAuthenticationAllowed completed /code/pre  You can find these by using the codelog show —style syslog -last 5m/code command. This will show the last 5 minutes of messages.   <comment335035> Have you tested by intentionally creating a failed login attempt? <comment345408> I've tried that.
