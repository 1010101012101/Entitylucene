How do I enable Wi-Fi-only email push? <body> Is it possible to get iOS's email push feature to work only when I'm on Wi-Fi?  <answer29342> strongAs far as I know, not with the stock options/strong. You may be able to do this on a jailbroken phone if there's a jailbreak community app for that. Short of that, you'd have to make one yourself.  Otherwise, you're down to changing these settings manually when you're away from WiFi.  <comment33675> That's a terrible answer! But that's not your fault, of course. Thank you.
