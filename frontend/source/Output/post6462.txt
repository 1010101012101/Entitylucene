How do I get vim to work at 256 colors in iTerm? <body> I just got a new iMac, and installed iTerm (0.10). On my last laptop 256 color mode worked fine, but I'm having trouble getting this to work on my new Mac.  I copied over all the settings, codeset $TERM/code to codexterm-256color/code, but no dice.  I changed my code.vimrc/code to the absolute minimum to try this out:  precodeset t_Co=256 syntax on /code/pre  Tried multiple colorschemes, too.   <answer6464> OK, so...  I just started vim again, and colors where there. Since then I did make a changehowever, I installed XCode. This is the only thing I did change, so there must be something in there that fixes this.  Thanks for the effort!  <comment6726> This SO question suggests using `let t_Co=256`, not set. Any results? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3761770/iterm-vim-colorscheme-not-working <comment6727> Also might try this article: http://jimlund.org/blog/?p=130 <comment23267> Prior to Mac OS X Lion 10.7, the terminfo files for xterm-256color and some others were part of the Xcode install instead of the regular system install. In Lion, they are now part of the system install. <comment225635> iTerm2 has the advantage of developer support for these kinds of issues. http://sites.google.com/site/iterm2home/ <comment225636> I just installed iTerm2 this afternoon, and it's excellent, Much closer to Terminal.app in it's cleanness, but with the extra functionality of iTerm, plus a few extra features of it's own.  GLTerminal is also a lot of fun, but thin on extra features ;) <comment225637> FYI, in Lion, Terminal supports 256 colors and has a number of other enhancements. It may be worth taking a look to see whether iTerm2 still offers something you specifically want that Terminal doesn't.
