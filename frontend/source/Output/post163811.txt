I have an idea for an APP .. where can I search to see if it already exists? <body> I have an idea for an APP but it may already exist. I have already tried Google; using a variety of search string combinations but have so far found nothing.   Can anyone suggest a more comprehensive way? I know you can contact patent lawyers / people who can look in patent databases for you, for a fee. This I am unsure of.  Thanks a lot.  Luke  <comment191949> An "App" itself can not be patented, so searching the patent databases will not help you, though it may give you hints. However, the guys at http://startups.stackexchange.com can probably give you way more help than I ever could.
