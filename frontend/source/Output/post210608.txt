Can I have audio from my PC output to Bluetooth while my video outputs to AirPlay? <body> As it stands, my Apple TV is hooked up directly via HDMI to my television. I have 2 amazing speakers that I use bluetooth to connect to and play from when I'm NOT using AirPlay. When I switch to AirPlay, the sound comes from my TV speakers which sound terrible, instead of my higher-quality bluetooth speakers.   Can I cast my MacBook's video stream via to the TV via AirPlay, while routing the audio through Bluetooth instead of my TV Speakers?   <answer210610> Just figured it out -   ol liConnect to AirPlay, so that both video and audio streams are going to the TV/li liOpen System Preferences  Sound. Click "output" tab. /li liSelect your bluetooth speakers. /li /ol  Voila.
