Can't import m4a files to Audacity <body> I have installed the latest version of codeffmpeg/code (3.1.2) through homebrew, and I have gone to Preferences - Libraries and located the codeffmpeg/code library in Audacity (code/usr/local/Cellar/ffmpeg/3.0.2/lib/libavutil.55.17.103.dylib/code).  Nothing happens when I load an m4a. If I import it through âŒ˜ + I it says "FFmpeg not found".  <comment310010> Is ffmpeg in your path?  Type `which ffmpeg` and post the results <comment310072> @Allan yes. `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`. I told me to locate `libavutil.55.17.103.dylib`.
