How to make cmd+tab get accepted in System Preferences > App Shortcuts as Parallels Desktop "Release Input" keyboard shortcut? <body> I'm currently on Mac OSX 10.11.3 running Parallels Desktop 10.3.0.  I've been using a Windows 7 VM loaded with Visual Studio &amp; many other .NET Framework app development programs &amp; utilities that all require a myriad of keyboard shortcuts in order to get the job done.  So, I configured Parallels Desktop to send strongemALL/em/strong keypresses to the VM when it has the focus so that these "myriad" Windows shortcuts won't conflict with the Mac OSX ones (which are myriad x 4 since I'm a keyboard/productivity geek).  Everything is working fine in both the Windows &amp; Mac OSX side with one exception..br I'd really like to map the default Parallels Desktop "Release Input" keyboard shortcut from the default strongctrl+alt/strong to strongcmd+tab/strong.br This way, when I wish to rapidly switch to a Mac app I won't have to press strongctrl+alt/strong &amp; immediately following strongcmd+tab/strong to access it. A quick double strongcmd+tab/strong would make the trick (the first one to release input form the VM &amp; the second one launching the Mac app switcher).br When I'm coding this is a real break in my flow.  I tried what Parallels recommends to set the keyboard shortcut to something other that strongctrl+alt/strong in: http://kb.parallels.com/en/114781  That's to set an App Shortcut for Parallels Desktop "Release Input" in System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  App Shortcuts.  Their instructions work fine for any key combination emexcept/em using strongcmd+tab/strong unfortunately.br It looks like that OSX won't accept this keyboard shortcut since it is considered a "reserved" system shortcut.  So, trying to find a solution, I thought to set a temporary shortcut in System Preferences and then hunt around in which plist file it got saved and edit that manually.br I found that the app shortcut got saved it in: ~/Library/Preferences/com.parallels.desktop.console.plist  I tried editing the plist file manually and changing the temporary shortcut I set earlier to strongcmd+tab/strong.br But guess what.. it still doesn't work..  Please, any help would be much appreciated.br Thank you in advance!
