How do I rename app icons on my iPad home screen? <body> How do I rename the apps on my home screen?  I have tried putting the app icons in edit mode ("wiggle mode") but I cannot find a way to rename them.  <answer288601> iOS doesn't have that functionality.  Names of application icons are provided by the application.  You can only name folders.  <answer288604> You strongcan't normally/strong rename applications on your home screen(springboard). However if your device is strongjailbroken/strong i.e you have cydia you can use Icon Renamer to change names of your applications. If you are not jailbroken wait for iOS 11 jailbreak and then rename your icons using this tweak :)  <comment364366> This is not a feature that is supported by iOS; thus, barring a jailbreak, this cannot be achieved. If you are referring to web app bookmarks, delete the current bookmark from your home screen and re-create it from within Safari, giving it a different name.
