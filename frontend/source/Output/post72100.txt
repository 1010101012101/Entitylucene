What is behind these "squares" of colour appearing on my screen? <body> This problem has been with me for a while, but recently is popping up every couple of minutes.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5HylE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I've a MacBook Pro mid-2010 Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce 320M 256 MB Memory: 8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3 (which I upgraded, don't remember where I bought them)  Is it a graphic problem? RAM problem? Software problem?  <comment83739> That looks like a hardware problem - have you tried an [SMC reset](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3964)?  Does the problem occur when the laptop is under especially heavy use, or anytime?  Have you tried removing the additional RAM and seeing if it continues to happen? <comment83742> Looks like some Google search results are behind them.
