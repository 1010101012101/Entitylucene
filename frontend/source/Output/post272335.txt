What does the arrow on the bottom left of the folder icon mean? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hv5Tl.jpg" alt="Finder window"  As you see the codemysql/code and codemysql-5.7.17-macos10.12-x86_64/code under the local path.br The codemysql/code folder icon has a arrow on the bottom left.  Does the arrow mean shortcut to the codemysql-5.7.17-macos10.12-x86_64/code? Or if not, if it is a other mysql entity folder?  <answer272337> The arrow means it is an alias or link, but it could lead anywhere. To find the destination, select the alias and press ⌘I (or right-click and choose Get Info), then look at the ‘Original’ path (or just open it and see where it leads).                                                img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1YKz.png" width="265"
