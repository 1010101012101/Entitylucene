How do I change the default Space for an app in Mission Control? <body> Under Snow Leopard and Spaces you could define which Space an app should automatically launch in, including the ability to indicate that it should be visible in every space.  My apps are respecting the settings I applied before upgrading to Lion -- for example, iChat, QuickTime Player, and my Billings time tracker show up in all Spaces, Chrome always launches in space 2, etc. -- but there no longer seems to be any way to modify them or add these kinds of defaults for new apps.  Is there any way to make these assignments with Mission Control?  <answer18998> Right-click (kbdcontrol/kbd+click) on the dock icon, Options  Assign To  <answer18999> You can do this from the dock.  Switch to the space you want to pin your app to, then access the options menu from its dock icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6Kc1.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer20833> h1No longer possible with System Preferences/h1  It seems impossible to use Mission Control or any other Apple-provided preference pane to change application—space bindings, or present an overview of bindings.   h1Using Terminal to view or change bindings/h1  h2An overview of application—space bindings/h2  Command:   codedefaults read com.apple.spaces/code  Where an application is listed without the UUID of a desktop space, this seems to mean strongdesktop 1/strong.

From the defaults(1) Mac OS X Manual Page:     … Defaults can be structured in very complex ways, making it difficult for the user to enter them with this command. …   h2A relatively fresh start/h2  To delete bindings without losing spaces:  ol liquit everything other than Finder and Terminal/li liin Terminal, command:   precodedefaults delete com.apple.spaces app-bindings /code/pre/li limake no attempt to use the Dock to set a binding/li lilog out./li /ol  h3Hint/h3  If you use Dock too soon to set a binding, you may find that strongeverything/strong you deleted from preferences for Spaces is automatically rewritten to that preference file.   Information may be cached somewhere. I don't know where.   h1Dock menus accessibility/h1  My experience of VoiceOver with Dock is that whilst Dock menus are accessible, the routine for changing a binding would be not particularly user-friendly.   h1Alternatives/h1  There's scope for a third party developer to write an application, maybe a preference pane, for easier overview/management of bindings.   <comment20796> Oh sure, post after me then think you'll get more rep because of the snazzy screenshot! Well, works for me. +1 <comment20798> Ha, as I was uploading the screenshot the little banner appeared, and I said "Knew I shouldn't have wasted time on this." Thanks:P <comment20800> Awesome, thanks. As luck would have it, 90 seconds after asking the question I noticed a tweet from Matt Gemmell that had the answer, so then **I** created a screen shot for answering my question but got here too late to answer it myself! <comment20819> Right click is control+click <comment20822> Ho Ho! So you are right, brain fart fixed. <comment22840> I'd like to see an answer that does not involve Dock. A raised comment under http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard/18656#18656 notes that there's no longer an overview of all bound applications. <comment118574> I spent *so long* looking for this information. This is useful to set Space assignments for menubar applications (i.e. those without a dock icon to right-click on.) Thank you *so much*.
