How do cope with a space when setting the $PATH <body> I want to add the sublime lib to my path but it has a space in it.   I have tried the obvious like you would navigate in the terminal   precodeE.g /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents  export PATH="/Applications/Sublime\ Text\  2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH" /code/pre  But I still get the error   precode/Applications/Sublime: No such file or directory /code/pre  I could rename it but I am curious how to resolve it. I am using bash.  <answer94685> To resolve it I made a simlink in   precodeln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/sublime/bin/subl /code/pre  I then added it to my path by using vi on ~./bashrc  precodeexport PATH="/usr/local/sublime/bin/:$PATH" /code/pre  Remember to source the .bashrc to pick up your changes  precodesource ~/.bashrc /code/pre  <answer115081> Use backslash or quotes, not both. You put the sequence backslash-space in the codePATH/code value.  precodeexport PATH="/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH" /code/pre  or  precodeexport PATH=/Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH /code/pre  Be sure not to wrap the line: it has to be spaces, not newlines.  Note that if you see an error like code/Applications/Sublime: No such file or directory/code from the codeexport PATH=â€¦/code line, then you have a syntax error in that line, such as a space after the equal sign: the assignment doesn't try to look up the directory. If the error is at some later time, then it isn't due to the PATH value, or if so only very indirectly: it's perfectly ok for entries in code$PATH/code not to exist, and a non-existent directory will not lead to an error message.  <comment110977> try `export PATH='/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH`? Also, is that newline intended? <comment110979> No its not a new line just comes out that way when I pasted it in. Your suggestion didn't help and it killed my path so couldn't use vi, had to switch to a different shell to change back. <comment110980> demure's suggestion should do it, but use double quotes: `export PATH="/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl:$PATH"`, otherwise $PATH won't be expanded. <comment110985> I had it as double quotes originally but in the .bashrc it still didn't like it. <comment110994> Could you be more precise? What do you mean by "it didn't like it"? Do you get an error (which one)? Or it simply didn't work? <comment111031> The error is after adding the above path with spaces I get /Applications/Sublime: No such file or directory, so as you can see it stops at the first space. I have resolved it with creating a simlink and that works for me now. <comment113413> What does echo $PATH show after the export?
