Will I still receive push notifications if I remove an app? <body> If I download an app on my iPhone and it automatically appears on my iPad and I delete it from my iPad that means no notifications should pop up on my iPad anymore because I deleted it - even if I use it on my iPhone, correct?  <answer150492> That is strongcorrect/strongâ€”the device won't be delivered notifications if you remove the app.  <answer150536> Correct. Only the device where the device is installed will receive the updates.  <comment177101> Why don't you try it yourself ? It's not that hard... <comment177103> Fish for a man and he'll eat one day. Learn a man to fish... <comment177104> I was just wondering because I donwloaded an app on my phone - a way to send text messages and it popped up on my ipad and I didn't want app on my ipad so now if someone messaged me on my iphone it shouldn't pop up on my ipad because I already deleted the app - so that's good!
