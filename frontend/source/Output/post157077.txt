User named [Update Needed] after installing yosemite with encrypted drive <body> I clean installed Yosemite on my macbook air. Everything went ok with the install, and when I restart, there is a second user named code[Update Needed]/code . The password for this user is the same password I set for the hard drive encryption. I have tried restarting and this user is still there.  I have logged in with this user and installed all the updates, still no luck.   <answer157159> ul liLog in into the Mac as administrator./li liBackup the Mac with Time Machine (optional but recommended)/li liLaunch System Preferences selecting System Preferences from the Apple menu./li liClick the Security &amp; Privacy preference pane./li liClick the FileVault tab./li liUnlock the pane clicking on the padlock (administrator password required)/li liDisable FileVault and wait (…about 3hrs with a 250GB no SSD HD)/li liRestart the Mac (optional but recommended)/li liGo back the FileVault tab./li liEnable FileVault and wait (…about 7hrs for me!!!)/li liRestart the Mac.br The unknown user account will disappear.br This should also now allow you to set automatic login./li /ul  emSources:/em FileVault and update needed at the login screen: How to solvebr Fresh install of Yosemite adds [Update Needed] userbr Login screen shows "update needed" but no updates are available  <comment217621> I think ill just keep that user, it doesn't bother me that much....
