Why does the combination fn+⌘+delete doesn't work? <body> As a new user of MacOS - coming from the Windows world -, I'm trying to quickly learn how the Delete key works here and what are the possible combinations with other keys.  However, while listed in this article (recent, Oct. 2016): https://medium.com/productivity-freak/macos-keyboard-shortcuts-41c8184f65a6 the combination kbdfn/kbd + kbd⌘/kbd + kbddelete/kbd doesn't seem to work. I tested in Notes, as well as Google Chrome (I thought at first it was a bug in Chrome).  I'm using macOS Sierra 10.12.5 (16F73) with an AZERTY keyboard (French layout).  <answer293256> I don't know why it gives that shortcut, but try control-k.  See https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201236  <answer293278> "delete" in this article refers to the backspace key (← or ⌫) not the actual delete key (⌦).  So the combination your are searching for is strong⌘ fn ⌫/strong or alternatively (if your keyboard has a number pad) strong⌘ ⌦/strong.  Note however that although these are system wide key commands, there are some 3rd-party applications that don't support them.  hr  EDIT: The article also got some combinations wrong. It's strong⌥ ⌫/strong for deleting the last word and strong⌥ ⌦/strong or strong⌥ fn ⌫/strong for deleting the next.  hr  strongEDIT2:/strong  strongIt seems like ⌘ ⌦ and ⌘ fn ⌫ AREN'T system wide key commands (if that is a thing). They don't work in TextEdit or Pages BUT they do work in some other applications such as Apple's Xcode or TextWrangler./strong  Nonetheless you can achieve the same behaviour by using ⌘ ⇧ → (left arrow key) to select the text to the end of the line and then deleting it. This also works for words with ⌥ instead and for single characters with only ⇧.  <comment370440> Thanks but this doesn't work, either in Notes, Google Chrome, or Eclipse. <comment370442> Well, as I've got a MacBook Pro, I don't have any numpad. And btw the "delete" key is actually the backspace key (with a ←). Indeed ⌥ ⌫ does delete the previous word and ⌥ fn ⌫ the next word. But while ⌘ ⌫ deletes forward(?) to the start of the line, ⌘ fn ⌫ does nothing. <comment370446> Please be more specific. I tested it myself before posting this. I also did it on the AZERTY keyboard just now, worked fine. <comment370466> @maxxyme Yeah, naming is a bit confusing. While in my native language keyboard layout it only says "delete" on the ⌦ key, on the US layout they are both called "delete". But it seems like Apple calls ⌦ "forward delete". ⌘ ⌫ deletes backwards to the start of the line for me. For ⌘ fn ⌫ see my edited answer above. <comment370744> OK just realised I understood ⌘ instead of Ctrl. My bad. So it works in Notes and Chrome, not in Eclipse (but that's quite understandable due to the high customisability of the commands).
