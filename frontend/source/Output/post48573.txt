Printing remotly from your iPhone or IPad using an app <body> I want to print stuff from my iPhone or IPad. My printer is connected to a PC. I saw there is an app called PrintCentral that after configuration should do the trick. It is a bit pricey, so I want to know:  a) Is PrintCentral a good app? br b) Is there a free or cheaper alternative?  EDIT: My PC is running Windows XP   <answer48574> FingerPrint (OS X &amp; Windows) is a paid application that enables a printer connected to your Mac or PC to become an AirPrint printer. It is a paid application.  strongFor Windows/strong  There is also a free program for Windows. You can download the files here. One they are downloaded, unzip the zip file and run the codeAirPrint_Installer.exe/code Then run either codeAirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 32Bit.reg/code or codeAirPrint iOS 5 FIX - 64Bit.reg/code depending on if you are running a 32 or a 64 bit version of Windows. Go back to codeAirPrint_Installer.exe/code, make sure "Service Startup" is set to "Auto" and click "Start". Reboot your computer. All these instructions and troubleshooting instructions can be found in the links above.  strongFor Mac/strong  AirPrint Activator is a free application that allows you to turn any shared printer into an Airprint printer. I have used it quite a bit now, and I highly recommend it. It has a very simple and easy to use UI:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iik2U.jpg" alt="Airprint Activator"  <comment55637> Thanks.
