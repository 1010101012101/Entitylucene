iPhone search function <body> Is it possible to get the search function of iPhone (when you go at the first screen on left) to work as the spotlight works when you put in words and display a dictionary ?   If not , is the same dictionary app which is installed on OSX, available for iOS? Thanks !  <answer50219> The iPhone spotlight doesn't have the dictionary function built in.   The dictionary app isn't available for iOS as well. But you can try this free app from Dictionary.com. I use this a lot and find it quite useful.  <answer50331> If you have a jailbroken iPhone, the free tweak SpotDict adds a button to the Spotlight interface for access to looking up words in the built-in dictionary. Here's a review of it with screenshots.  <comment57552> ye got it. Too many buttons around for a dict bit annoying. guess i can live with that tho <comment57553> For some application, like Safari, or even Stanza, you can actually press and hold the word, there will be a Define pop up. Select it, and iOS will give you the definition of the word.
