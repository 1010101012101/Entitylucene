queueing notifications to give me uninterrupted focus time <body> Between instant messages, emails, and calendar invites, I probably get notified about once every 5-10 minutes during normal work hours, and the social pressure of dealing with the messages quickly overpowers my desire to be productive by working uninterrupted for longer blocks of time, even though 99% of them don't need a response until 2-4 hours later.  Is there any way to block off time during the day so that I can consume these notifications in bulk instead of piecemeal? The options I can think of that could work well are:  ul liA way to say "Only post notifications once every hour / two hours / whatever"/li liA way to make "Do not disturb" mode happen for more than one period during the day/li /ul  Ideally there would also be some way to override this for notifications that I expect to be relevant or urgent.  The only way I've thought of to do this so far is really crappy -- quit all the applications that send me notifications, and make calendar events to remind me to go check them at certain times during the day.
