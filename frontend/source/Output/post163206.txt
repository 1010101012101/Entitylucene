Sync indicates music on phone, phone says no <body> I celebrated Christmas earlier this week with some family, and recieved an iTunes gift card. I wanted to re-make an entire playlist for my phone, so I did. However, my phone won't let me sync because I don't have enough memory. However, the playlist I created is only 202 songs and would fit onto my phone. However, when I go into sync, it says there is music still on my phone, even though my phone indicates there is no music.  I attempted to that no music was synced to my phone:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1dNy.png" alt=""  But when I look "On My Phone" it says I have all of these songs, which I don't want:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZt0Q.png" alt=""  When it comes to my actual phone, it only syncs about 57 songs with me having the "don't sync music" checked.  I just want those apparently 203 songs off my phone so I can sync the new playlist.  <comment191046> Are they Purchased? Have you backed them up to your computer?
