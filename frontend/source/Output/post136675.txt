Exchange calendar listed twice <body> I have one (just one) Exchange account configured:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1oHdP.png" alt="Internet Accounts preferences"  But Calendar shows it twice:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wjwl7.png" alt="Calendars tab in Calendar"  In the emAccounts/em tab of the Calendar preferences it also listed twice:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KVA7j.png" alt="Accounts tab of the Calendar preferences"  and if I try to remove one of them I am emredirected/em to the Internet Accounts settings (where only one is listed).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XzXV9.png" alt="Calendar warning upon account removal"  Is there a fix or should I completely remove the Exchange account and add it again?  <answer139555> Following the discussion suggested in the comments I was able to find a empartial/em solution:  ol liIn the emInternet Accounts/em preferences (system-wide) uncheck the emCalendars/em option from the Exchange account/li liIn the preferences of the Calendars application choose the emAccounts/em tab and disable the only visible account/li liIn the system-wide emInternet Accounts/em preferences re-enable the exchange account/li /ol  The only drawback is that you will still see a disable Exchange account in your Calendars preferences.  <comment162210> Did a quick search for you - try the steps listed in the accepted answer here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5477854
