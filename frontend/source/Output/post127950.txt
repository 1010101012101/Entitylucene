Has anyone seen this weird floating light in iTunes before? <body> I connected my iPhone to my computer, and iTunes opened up as it always does. However, I got this weird video playing in the window. I have no videos on my phone or in my iTunes library. It wasn't interactiveâ€”clicking didn't do anything.   It's like I had a UFO on my computer :) Has anyone seen something like this? I can't recreate it for the life of me.  weird bug? http://f.cl.ly/items/1k451s3v343z2f3f0F3z/itunesgif.gif.  <answer127957> What you are seeing is the visualizer in iTunes.  Right now its just in idle mode.  It will dance if you play something.  Hold down Command and press T to turn it off.
