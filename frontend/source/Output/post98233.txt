Sync apps from computer to iPhone using iTunes <body> I am unable to transfer apps from my computer to iPhone 5 running 6.0.1. Whenever I click on the codeInstall/code button the button changes to codeWill Install/code.   Similarly, as soon as I click on the codeSync/code button. synchronization terminates without any error at the step codeDetermining apps to sync/code.  Any ideas on how I can fix this?  <answer98253> Sounds like you might need to do a factory reset on the phone (AFTER DOING A BACKUP!).  Best to backup to your computer instead of to iCloud, since there are some things that are not backed up to iCloud.  Alternatively, just used the "purchased - not on this phone" feature in the app store on the device. That will also let you install any app.
