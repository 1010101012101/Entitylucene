Using Terminal, how can I find which directory is my USB drive mounted in? <body> I am using Terminal and have looked through directories.  I just can't find where my USB drive its directory is.  Which directory is my USB drive mounted in?  <answer60232> All drives (internal, external and networked) get mounted in code/Volumes/code. You should see a folder there with the name of your USB drive as it appears on your desktop or in the Finder.  <answer70520> Some techniques to try:  precodels -a /Volumes /code/pre  or...  precodels -l /Volumes /code/pre  or...  precodels -la /Volumes /code/pre  ...may prove useful.    precodemount /code/pre  seems to give all the partitions that might be useful with Disk Utility, during formatting, etc.  you can probably reach your USB drive directly using:  precode/Volumes/&lt;NameOfYourDrive&gt; /code/pre  This applies to other types of drives as well: optical, internal and external hard drives.  All mounted volumes.  <answer189389> You could also try this command in terminal to get more hardware info on your USB devices  precodesystem_profiler SPUSBDataType /code/pre  <answer205734> In general, to find where something is mounted, you can run this command from the terminal:   precodedf -H  /code/pre  This also provides useful information about the space on the drive.  <answer270012> precodediskutil list; df -Hl /code/pre  hr  ul licodediskutil/code   /li licodedf/code/li /ul  <comment69481> More generally, you can use the `mount` command to see all the mounted volumes and where they are mounted. (Only a subset are mounted in /Volumes.) <comment81866> AFAIK both external storage devices and .dmg files are mounted in `/Volumes`, at least by default. What other subset are you referring to here? <comment177251> You can also drag&drop the usb drive from the Finder to the Terminal to get its path ;-) <comment224570> How can this command be used to solve the problem described in the question? <comment333240> This is useful to developers like myself who are trying to specifically differentiate a USB thumbdrive of unknown name from other mounted volumes.  This could happen for example, in systems that can be overridden by alternate settings stored on a thumbdrive, IF the thumbdrive is present.  In this case I want to not care what the volume is named, I just want to find whatever thumbdrive(s) is present.
