Add a hosts file entry without jailbreaking <body> I have an iPad that needs to be able to connect to a server via its short hostname, e.g. http://app instead of http://app.example.com. The network it connects to assigns it a domain name other than example.com so it doesn't work automatically.  Is there a way to add a hosts entry (/etc/hosts) for that server in iOS, or add the appropriate domain name to the resolver search list without jailbreaking?  <answer17082> h2No./h2  See this answer on stackoverflow.  <answer20542> No, but as a work-around, you could have your iPad proxy to a Mac on your home LAN and then do the DNS trickery there.  (I'm assuming that you need this ability during debugging/testing, not "everywhere.")  <answer20548> In general, editing the Hosts file is a bad solution. I only use it for temporary testing, and always remove any hosts file entry a few minutes after adding it.  You should be using a DNS server of some kind to setup your custom domain, perhaps this is possible with your wifi router, or else you can set up any mac as a DNS server.  As a nice side benefit, having your DNS server on the LAN will make your internet noticeably faster. Most people are using their router as a DNS server and they really are not fast enough to implement DNS properly. It's a good idea to use a fast remote DNS server (which one is best will depend on what city you live in), but having one on your LAN is even better.  You can google for instructions how to setup codebind/code on any mac, it's free. Or you can purchase Lion Server from Apple in the App Store, and download Server Admin Tools to configure bind with a nice GUI (with Lion, unlike Snow Leopard, you have to download Server Admin Tools separately form buying a license for Mac OS X Server. Basically they've separated the advanced server tools out into a separate download from the basic ones).  <answer136316> Use Weblock - AdBlock for iOS app to create a redirect rule from codehttp://app/code to the IP and port you like.  (Only works when on a WIFI network)  <comment18603> I found a workaround, although not ideal: you can manually add additional search domains *per network* in wifi settings: http://techinch.com/2011/02/04/change-your-dns-settings-on-iphone-ipod-touch-and-ipad/ <comment165602> Why not just connect by the IP address and save all of the other rigamarole? <comment175124> @SaxDaddy for instance there are cases where you need more than one local domain simultaneously. <comment186965> @SaxDaddy because sometimes you get into CORS issues when you access javascript from elsewhere than the domain it was meant to run from. <comment187991> Took me a little while to figure out how to make this work, but this is a great solution. Thanks! <comment261577> Perhaps if you stayed on a VPN, you could maintain that DNS trickery on the go? <comment312919> Worked for me! The only gotcha is: you need to use the wildcard syntax given, so if you would like to redirect app.myserver.local to 192.168.1.100, then the correct syntax is: Redirect URL: \*.myserver.local/\*; Proxy IP: 192.168.1.100; Proxy port: 80 (or 8080)
