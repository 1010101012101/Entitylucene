One was created as an offshoot of the other. In the Finder, the original displays a thumbnail for the icon but the offshoot copy displays the standard Excel icon with the (XLSX) "button" in the lower left corner.  I've tried:  ol li"Save As" and giving the file a different name. That didn't work./li liChecking Get Info on both and the only anomaly I see is that the offshoot is a larger file, despite containing fewer tabs and less data./li /ol  How to make the Finder show the icon thumbnail for all Excel documents?  <answer37024> The document filename doesn't matter as much as its extension.
