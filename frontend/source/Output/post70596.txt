Can arrow keys be added to an iPhone keyboard? <body> Is there a way to add arrow keys to an iPhone keyboard under iOS 6?  <answer70604> It might be possible on a jailbroken device, but not on with standard iOS. There are just no user configurable options for the keyboard, beyond adding additional languages. App developers can augment it slightly, and there are some apps with additional keys, such as Prompt and Textastic, but it's otherwise a standard system component that can't be changed.  <comment81977> Any Bluetooth keyboard lets you use arrow keys as well as many navigation shortcuts. <comment82092> If you have clumsy fingers, how are you supposed to properly navigate to a former place in a text block? A lot of deleting? <comment82095> My original question asked this but was edited out:  is there an app that offers a different system wide keyboard? Thanks for your ideas! <comment82097> Thanks for your comment. Looking for a way to change the default touchscreen keyboard, however <comment82101> @Nick_B That second question was edited out since we prefer one question per question. It's fine to ask that second question and link here in case robmathers has an idea... <comment82106> Okay. I considered it to be a subset of original question (is there a way to add arrow keys), as in maybe that is a way to solve the issue of needing arrow keys on iphone.  But whatever is best. Will follow up later. Thank you
