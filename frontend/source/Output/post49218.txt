Troubleshooting high CPU activity in the WindowServer process <body> As far as I know emWindowServer/em process is used by all apps to draw windows that we see. And a lot of people are reporting a problem when their emWindowServer/em is using a lot of CPU. Is there any way to find out what process is interacting with emWindowServer/em besides looking at the precesses at the emActivityMonitor/em, shutting them down and looking at the result?  <answer49227> Check out the man page for perfdiagnose. This tool is purpose-made for diagnosing exactly this sort of issue, where a simpler tool like Activity Monitor can only show you symptoms.  The output from perfdiagnose is not intended for end-users, but for developers and teams at Apple. If you're not able to make any sense of the logs it produces, your best bet is to attach them to a bug report submitted to Apple.  <comment56350> Awesome, I think it's just the thing I'm looking for. I'm kinda developer myself. Thank you
