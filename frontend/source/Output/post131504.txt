How to use the iPad wordpress app when blog runs iThemes Security <body> This was closed as off-topic on the Wordpress SE site, so I'm hoping it fits better here, since it's specific to using an iOS app.  I'm using iThemes Security on my site, so I have a "secret word" required to access the WP admin. So to get to wp-admin I have to visit:  domain.com/wp/secretword  I would like to be able to blog from my ipad sometimes, but the iPad wordpress app requires the URL of the site for obvious reasons, and doesn't seem able to get through the security plugin.  Has anyone managed to do this kind of setup and if so, how?  <comment168309> Any app should work tied to XML-RPC, which is not related to `domain.com/wp/secretword`. There's a specific setting for this inside the *Tweaks* section of the plugin. <comment168402> I'm afraid I don't understand your answer.  I can't even log in via the iOS app, because the app won't even connect to the blog.  How to I allow it through the "secret word" login URL? <comment168403> You should provide much more info. What exact app are you using? Snapshot of the error? Plugin configuration details? <comment168427> As stated in the question I'm using the iPad app "Wordpress".  The plugin is set to require a secret word to access the admin area.  There is no error per se, the iPad app simply does not see that there is a Wordpress installation at the address given.
