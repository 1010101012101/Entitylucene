VTDecoderXPCService taking too much macbook pro (late 2013) CPU everytime I airplay to apple TV (4th) <body> Apple tv airplay related problem. I searched online and suggested approaches barely worked, such as broken video on icloud, or specific software operating. But I actually have my own way to solve. Force stop "Airplayxpchelper", airplay then automatically closes. Click "airplay" again, this time, VTDecoderXPCService won't take up so much CPU anymore.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o7h0J.png" alt="enter image description here"
