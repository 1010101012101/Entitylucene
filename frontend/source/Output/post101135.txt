Does MBP and anti-glare MBP use the same top case? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYVCY.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I am now using a 2011 MacBook Pro with anti-glare display.  I am going to replace the palm top case (The unibody case with palm, speaker and keyboard)  But I got noticed that the anti-glare display uses different top case from the regular glossy display, so I have to pay attention while buying the new top case, it that true?  I have contacted some eBay sellers, they seems not sure about this.  Thanks.  <answer101157> The single difference between the Glossy and the anti glare MBP is the presence of a glass panel on the glossy one.   So yes they use the same body.   <comment119073> There is no top case on the unibody Mac line. The unibody is the last piece left on the workbench when you tear down a MacBook Pro.  Might you link to iFixit.com to indicate the exact part nuber you are proposing to "swap"? <comment119091> Hello, thanks for your response, I have attached a picture on my question.
