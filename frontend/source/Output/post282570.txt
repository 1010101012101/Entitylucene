How to erase my iPhone photos completely? <body> I decided to delete all of my iPhone's photos so I copied everything to iPhoto and deleted everything on my phone. But I still worry if somebody could recover my deleted photos from my iPhone? Does this method completely erase my photos on iPhone?   <answer282575> Open strongAlbums/strong view in strongPhotos/strong by tapping the icon in the lower-right corner. Now find the album called strongRecently Deleted/strong (it will have an icon with a circled trash can).  Open it, tap strongSelect/strong in the upper-right corner, then strongDelete All/strong in the lower-left corner. Your photos will be permanently deleted from your iPhone.
