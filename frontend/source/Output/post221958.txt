Is it possible to add an app to your wishlist in the desktop version of the App Store <body> I love adding apps to my wishlist on the iPhone or iPad.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kYaZ2.png" alt="enter image description here"  I would only find it normal that the same thing can be done with the Mac OS X version of the AppStore.  Obviously, this feature should be located under the little arrow of the price tag, right under the app's icon:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9QsJJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  But it's not the case:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XtYy.png" alt="enter image description here"  It seems that gifting an app from the Mac OS X version of the App Store isn't there either.  As we can see in the 3rd image, it isn't on the right-hand side either.  So, am I missing something, or is the desktop version of the App Store a diminished version of the iOS's?  <answer288892> You're not missing anything, it is as you suggest. Make a feature request since the feature doesn't exist.
