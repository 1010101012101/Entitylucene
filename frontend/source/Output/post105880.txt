Is there a way to recognise active applications that are not being used so a script could shut them down? <body> Is there a way to recognise active applications that are not being used so a script could shut the down? I'd like to recognise an application that is running but has not accepted keystrokes recently and either shut it down or ask the user if they want shut it down. I'm particularly looking for an App that could do this or if it is possible via Applescript, how to do this.  (Ideally, it would have a white list and blacklist for whether to shutdown and/or inform the user.)  <comment124507> Recent versions of OS X do this for you: "Automatic termination eliminates the need for users to quit an app. Instead, the system manages app termination transparently behind the scenes, terminating apps that are not in use to reclaim needed resources such as memory." ([Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/MOSXAppProgrammingGuide/CoreAppDesign/CoreAppDesign.html)) But perhaps you're talking about a specific app? <comment124582> Yep, I know that this is coming in Mavericks but I the main scenario is that I want to shut down Skype in the daytime if I have not used it for 15 minutes.
