Partial spell check with PowerPoint 2016 for Mac <body> I am often showing some code examples on slides. So I would like to disable spell check for that particular slides ore boxes.  I have a slide template for code examples and it would be great if I could disable spell checks on that slide template. I have also a textBox for code where it would be possible to disable spell check. I also use the same font type for code examples.  Researching  the net revealed that you can partially disable spell check for word is there something similar for powerpoint?
