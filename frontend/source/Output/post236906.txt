How many MB can I send on iMessage? <body> I was wondering if anyone could tell me how many MB I can send over iMessage? And when and why messages get compressed sometimes seemingly by random. I find it very awkward that Apple made this very important information secret and nowhere to be found on the net.   iPhone 6, iOS 9.x  <answer236909> This is from the iPhone user guide:     strongShare photos, videos, your location, and more/strongbr    With iMessage or MMS,   you can send and receive photos and videos, and send locations,   contact info, and voice memos. The size limit of attachments is   determined by your service providerâ€” iPhone may compress photo and   video attachments when necessary.   You didn't indicate if you needed an answer for emwifi/em or emcellular/em.    <comment290036> Check this out http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/70645/is-there-a-limit-for-the-attachment-size-in-messages <comment290265> Well an answer for each would be good. And I can't see an answer for either on the text you provided, but thanks anyway. <comment290267> Thanks! it answered it but didn't explain why some messages sometimes get compressed (that is not 100MB). I was just abroad and got a movie from home and that video should be under 100MB. And yes, iMessage was on. Odd! <comment290299> @MacProGirl, This a clear answer for cellular: it's up to your carrier.  Therefore, Apple doesn't put a limit on it, your cell carrier does. <comment290309> That's not correct. See the other correct answer. 100 MB is the limit.
