Is it possible to use an Apple Time Capsule just as a network attached backup drive and not a router? <body> strongShort Question :/strong  Is it possible to use an Apple Time Capsule just as a network attached backup drive and not a router?   strongBackground :/strong  We want to use a separate router to manage a more complex network. We where looking at not using an Apple Time Capsule and instead a 3rd party NAS (probably Synology) for Time Machine to backup to but as I've read in multiple places that backing up to a 3rd party NAS can cause the Time Machine backups to become corrupt / miss files due to the fact the HDD in a 3rd party NAS is ext4/NTFS/... and can't be OS X journaled (or what ever Time Machine prefers)  We've got a network as follows :   ul liTP-Link Gigabit Load Balance Router with VPN (we will also set VLANs, static IPs etc on here)/li li48 port Netgear gigabit network switch/li limultiple in wall RJ45 ports /li li4x Ubiquity UAP Wi-Fi access points (some indoor some outdoor)/li /ul  <answer256406> Yes, you can simply disable routing on TimeCapsule and set it as DHCP client.  img src="https://www.macobserver.com/imgs/tmo_articles/20140224-mgga-timecapsule-bridgemode-3.jpg" alt="timecapsule bridge"  <answer265394> Yes, this is possible and actually quite simple. To prevent the Time Capsule from acting as a WiFi access point or router, and use it only as a backup disk, just open the AirPort Utility app on a Mac (Applications - Utilities - AirPort Utility) and do the following:  ul liSelect your Time Capsule and hit codeEdit/code./li liGo to the tab labeled codeWireless/code (not codeNetwork/code as zhovner suggests, as putting it in bridge mode only stops it from being a router but does not stop it from being a network access point that your devices will connect to)/li liFrom the codeNetwork Mode/code pop-up menu, choose codeOff/code./li liClick codeUpdate/code, and the base station will restart and load the new settings./li /ul  The result will be a Time Capsule you can still wirelessly backup your Macs to, but does not function as a router or access points, so none of your devices will connect to it.  This is the setup that I use; I have 3 eero routers and thus needed the Time Capsule to not be an access point, and these steps stopped it from being that but let me keep backing up to it as usual.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZL3XE.png" alt="enter image description here" emFrom this wireless tab, just choose codeoff/code in the codeNetwork mode/code pop-up and hit codeupdate/code./em  Source is a Macworld article on the topic.  <comment319760> Never set a server-like device (like a NAS) as DHCP-client... <comment332730> posted an answer, let me know whether it helps or not or if you have any questions <comment332731> -1 this isn't what the OP Sam wants: putting it in bridge mode only stops it from being a router but does not stop it from being a network access point that other devices will connect to. <comment333978> Thanks @Owlswipe , couple of questions :   - after config as above, does the time machine now act as a wired network device and any wireless backups to it are done via 3rd party acess point -- router -- time machine. Or does the time machine still create its own wireless for backups ? <comment333979> - Bit confused by your first line "To prevent the Time Capsule from acting as a WiFi access point or router, and use it only as a router". The last part "and use it only as a router" is that a typo ? Im trying to configure it as neither an access point, or router. <comment333991> @Sam 1. backups are done on the local network through the router, the Time Capsule won't make its own network after this. 2. yep, typo, edited. <comment334000> @klanomath what is the problem with that setting? <comment334007> Thanks @owlswipe, ive recently been playing around with time machine on my macbook pro backing up to a Synology NAS, my laptop has a wireless N wifi card, and the Access points are limited at 300mbps throughput. Which equates to 37.5MB per second under best conditions. But when i backup im getting somthing much much lower than this. It takes about 4hrs to do a 10gb backup wirelessly. 10Gb zip files saved to the NAS takes about 45 mins in comparison. Do you get the same very slow speeds backing up to a time capsule over wifi (as per your config above) ? or is it quicker ? <comment334027> @sam Backups for me are really slow, this is because of the max write speed of a [hard drive](http://bit.ly/2i4qelw) (HDD). While a [solid state drive](http://bit.ly/2i4rCVn) (SSD) like those in newish macs can write data really fast (like 3 GB per second in the case of the new 15-inch MBP), hard drives (like those in the Time Capsule) max out at write speeds of around 40 MB per second ([source](https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3395)). And that speed is if your device is wired to the Time Capsule: it'll be much slower in practice over WiFi. 2.5 GB an hour is slow but not ridiculously so. <comment334030> @sam Your WiFi is 37.5 mega*bits* per second, so that means 4.6875 mega*bytes* per second ([conversion](http://bit.ly/2i4uodf)). You'll get something less than that in practice, given the time it takes to write to the Time Capsule's comparatively slow hard drive, so expect the progress of your backups to go up by 1-4 MB per second if everything's working properly. If it's slower than that, you might have a problem (maybe your WiFi's dropping out, or your TC's HDD is struggling). Your fancy Synology NAS is probably an SSD or faster HDD, and thus is getting close to actually 4 megabytes per sec. <comment334142> sorry my bad, i mean we have 300mbps through put on our wifi access points = 37.5 megabytes per second. (roughly 30 megabytes is achived on a read / write test to the NAS. The Synology NAS is an entry level unit with 512ram, and fitted with a 3TB WD red NAS HDD capable of 6gb/s (although the best speed ive ever been able to achieve is 100 megabytes ps over a wired connection when doing a read / write test (not a time machine test as time machine backups seem to be significantly slower)). Sounds like the TM / TC backups are going to be slow regardless then. <comment334155> @sam Oh, I see. Well have no worries, I think the TC will probably be slow regardless (could be sped up by turning off the encryption of backups in System Prefs, if you have that on).
