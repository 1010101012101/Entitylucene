How can I setup Transmit along with Sidestep? <body> I'm using Sidestep to securely connect the Internet from everywhere I am. I have my own server as an SSH proxy.  But I'm facing trouble with Transmit which doesn't seem to use the proxy settings defined by Sitestep.  I know there are some options available in Transmit to configure a proxy server, but since I really don't know much about proxy, SOCKS and stuff. I didn't succeed.  From all my tests, Transmit always seems to use the direct connection without going through the proxy.  Any hints?
