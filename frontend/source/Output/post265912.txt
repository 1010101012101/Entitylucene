Manually adjust custom auto-correction dictionary? <body> I'm using iOS 9.3.5. One of the very handy features is that if I type, it auto-corrects, and it even has picked up on words that I uniquely use so it can suggest those to me.  Here's the problem: I type a lot on it, and I've done so many typos that the phone auto-corrects to my typos and if I misspell a word it suggests the typo version of words along with the correct spelling (which is hugely annoying and makes it hard for me to get it to the right spelling sometimes). I would hope that there would be some place in Settings that is populated with all the automatically added custom words that I could go through and manually remove the mistaken additions. Is there a way to do this?
