How do I enable A5/3 cellular encryption on an iPhone or iPad? <body> I want to only connect to A5/3 networks to prevent MITM attacks on my cellular data.  I'm not concerned if the attacker is the mobile operator themselves.. (assuming that mobile operator can't be spoofed).  ul liHow do I enable and force A5/3 encryption on an Apple device?/li /ul  I'm interested in this because I bridge my laptop to my iPad and need to ensure my laptop data can't be intercepted by an eavesdropper within radio reach of my device(s).  The risk I'm trying to prevent is the GPRS version of the Wifi pineapple.     <comment144623> Even if there were a native switch (there isn't), even if a jailbreak did this (your best bet for accomplishing this) I would still use a VPN on the Mac to make it hard for those that might collect your data to then make use of it. You can't prevent interception of radio signals, so you might reword the call to action to be more precise about what risk you want to control here. <comment144628> If I use a VPN on my ipad/iphone, does that mean that traffic from my tethered mac is safe? @bmike
