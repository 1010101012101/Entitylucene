None of my shell command is working for me like ls, java, php etc Please help  <answer24570> Show hidden files in Finder. Then you can either fix the problem in TextEdit, or simply remove/rename the file. There is no default code~/.profile/code on Mac OS X, only a global code/etc/profile/code (and you may also have a code~/.bash_profile/code).  <answer28792> If you still get to the shell prompt, you can use code: &gt; ~/.profile/code to create a new and empty file. Afterwards open a new shell in Terminal (by opening a new tab or window) and your environment should work again.   In addition: When editing .profile (or .bash_profile) it is always helpful to open a shell (terminal window) embefore/em you start editing. So even if you mess up the edit, you still have a working shell to fix issues (because .profile is only read once at start so further edits don't impact a running shell unless you source .profile again). And as usual: strongmake backups/strong.  <comment27588> Get it from your backup ? If on Lion what editor did you use as Versions might have it. (For original .profile just delete it)
