Writing current date to plist file using the command line <body> I'm trying to use this command to do so:  precodedefaults write test.plist LatestDate date "+%y-%m-%d" /code/pre  where codeLatestDate/code is the key I'm modifying. The problem is, it doesn't recognize codedate "+%y-%m-%d"/code as what I'm trying to write to the key, and when I put it in quotes it simply writes that text, not the date to the key.  How should I go about doing this?  <answer255635> In defaults, date is just an option, not the actual date command. You need to actually pass the date.  precodedefaults write test.plist LatestDate $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %l:%M:%S +0000") /code/pre  <comment318405> I'm kind of confused as to what this is doing: the normal command gives me an `unexpected argument` error, and using `-date $(date +"%Y")` gives me  `2016-10-03T10:00:00Z`. I'm fine with the Date T Time Z format, but the actual time seems kind of strange... at 10 AM it gave that and I changed the system time to 11 AM, but it still gives that <comment318407> The edit I issued seemed to fix the problem <comment318408> @SkeletonBow Yep, oops sorry, cheers for the edit.
