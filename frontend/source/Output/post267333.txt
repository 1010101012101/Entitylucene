How to make KEXT files open with Finder <body> I frequently edit files inside of kernel extension (.KEXT) files on OS X.  To do this, I have to right-click and "Show Package Contents".  To save time, I would like to simply double-click the package and have it open with Finder.br Ideally, Finder would show the full folder hierarchy in column view.  Currently, when I show the package contents, the folder hierarchy is "reset" with the package as root.  As you can see in this screenshot, there is no horizontal scrollbar, so I can't quickly traverse up the hierarchy as I could in a normal directory tree.  I'm working in Sierra, but this question could apply to any recent version of OS X.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/exAOy.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer267350> As far as I'm aware, there is no way to make packages simply behave like regular folders in macOS. However, to make your life a bit easier, you may want to take a look at this similar question â€” there you can find instructions for adding a keyboard shortcut to Show Package Contents, and if you're willing to do a bit more work, creating an Automator action to determine which to do automatically.  <answer267352> Create an Automator Service using the setting in the image below.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRgcp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Then assign it a keyboard shortcut in: System Preferences  Keyboard  Shortcuts  Services  I assigned it: kbdoption/kbdkbdcommand/kbdkbdK/kbd  strongCode for Run Shell Script:/strong  precodefor f in "$@" do     fn="$(basename "$f")"     ext="${fn##*.}"     if [[ $ext == kext ]]; then         open "$f/Contents"     fi done /code/pre  <comment335453> Thank you. Do you know of a way to do it with a mouse double-click instead of keyboard shortcut? <comment335506> @Elliott, I would not do it because, in order for that to happen the `.kext` extension would have to be registered with Launch Services as to what App is to open it and by default **Open with:** for the `.kext` extension is **Not applicable** and IMO shouldn't be changed as it may have unintended consequences in doing so. I'd use the method in my answer or do nothing at all. BTW, By making this a Service, you can right-click the KEXT and select Open KEXT from the Services section of the Context Menu in Finder. Continued in next comment... <comment335507> It's not as easy as a double-click but it all mouse movements and doesn't have the unintended consequences jeopardy associated with registering the extension to respond to a double-click.
