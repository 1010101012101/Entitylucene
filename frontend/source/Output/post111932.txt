Mac App mysteriously remembers deleted settings <body> After evaluating several its demo version, I decided to buy Linkinus from the Mac App Store.¹ As I had played with the settings a bit, I wanted to do a clean reset before seriously using it.  So I deleted all preference files and folders containing with the app's or its developers's name from my home directory, which were:  precode~/Library/Application Support/Linkinus 2 ~/Library/Caches/net.conceited.Linkinus ~/Library/Preferences/net.conceited.Linkinus.plist ~/Library/Preferences/net.conceited.LinkinusSysInfoPlugIn.plist /code/pre  To my surprise, Linkinus still remembered at least a part of its preferences after relaunch.  So I dug deeper, reinstalled the app and also deleted:  precode/private/var/db/BootCaches/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/app.net.conceited.Linkinus.playlist /code/pre  As that didn't help as well, I tried to deactivate iCloud – also without success. I even used fseventer to take a look at the files read and written while using Linkinus, but that also didn't give any additional insights.  Can anybody solve that mystery?  hr  ¹ Yeah I know, the developers appear to have disappeared for a while, but I still like the app.  <answer111992> The app is pefectly innocent, this is an issue with preference caching on Mavericks.  What finally worked was running codedefaults delete $app_id/code, so in my case:  precodedefaults delete net.conceited.Linkinus /code/pre  strongSource:/strong Deleting plist file does not reset app on Mac OS 10.9 Mavericks on StackOverflow  <comment131508> Linkinus doesn't appear to create any containers. In fact, I used `find ~ -iname '*linkinus*'` to find the above directories, which also should have caught containers.
