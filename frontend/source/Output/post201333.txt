Importing citation style to Zotero from Citavi <body> I am a Mac user so I can't use Citavi.  My institute has its own citation style but they only provide a Citavi citation file. I don't know a way to import a Citavi citation file into Endnote, Zotero or Mendeley so I don't have to use Windows....  Do you have a tip for me?  <answer202213> I'm sorry to say that there is no way to do that. Citavi citation styles are in their own format and there is no conversion tool. There is a tool for Zotero/Mendeley styles that let's you find close matches that you may found useful.
