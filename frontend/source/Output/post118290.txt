`LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -1712 for the file </path/to/folder>` when I attempt `open .` <body> I suddenly came across this error when I attempted to do codeopen ./code to open the current directory in Finder, a command that I use quite frequently:  precodeysim:~/Downloads$ open . LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -1712 for the file /Users/ysim/Downloads. /code/pre  It persisted for a few minutes and went away by itself. I tried googling it but the only two hits I saw had to do with ImageMagick and Automator, neither of which I use. Does anyone know why it happens and how to prevent it?   <answer118293> That error means an Apple Event timed out.  precodeerror -1712 errAETimeout: the AppleEvent timed out  /code/pre  You can either open Activity Monitor and look to see if you notice an Application or process that states codeNot responding/code or hit kbdoption/kbd kbdcommand/kbd kbdesc/kbd then codeforce quit/code any non-responding application.  It's possible the application or process was already open and by using codeopen ./code it tried to launch it for whatever reason. Often it's an Automator or AppleScript that is waiting for user interaction and "times out" waiting.  <comment182496> Since i updated to yosemite ( osx 10.10 )  i get this always when opening more than 6 urls simultaneously <comment299174> Perfect. Thank you!
