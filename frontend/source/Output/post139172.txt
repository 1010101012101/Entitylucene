OS X Mavericks system-wide VPN settings doesn't work for particular applications <body> I'm using OS X Mavericks and I have a systemwide VPN setting that web browsers like Safari work well. However, I also want the LINE instant message software to use this VPN setting, but LINE seems to neither apply the systemwide VPN setting nor provide options about it.  As you may know, LINE is blocked in China, but I want to use it to contact foreign friends. Do you know there's any way for it to use the VPN?
