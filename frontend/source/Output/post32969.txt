How do I change my TimeMachine volume in a script <body> I have a TM volume on my desk at work and I also have one at home. That way, I have a better shot of my data surviving a disaster. Right noow I have to manually change the TM volume based on where I am.  I'd like to use some location aware software (like Marco Polo) and have it just switch the volume. I tried using Applescript and Automator to make the switch but I haven't been able to be consistently successful.   I'm looking for a more terminal/shellscript based way to switch the TM volume.  Any ideas?  <answer32986> What I'd do is the following. You need to create a copy of code/Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist/code. Put it somewhere (example: code~/somewhere/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist.diskA/code). Then change from System Preferences the disk to which you want to back up. Create another copy and put it to code~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB/code). Then do something like this  precodeln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB sudo rm /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist sudo ln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk /Library/Preferences/com.apple.TimeMachine.plist /code/pre  Then the script when using disk A would be  precoderm ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk  ln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskA ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk  /code/pre  and when using disk B would be     rm ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk      ln -s ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.diskB ~/somewhere/com.apple.com.TimeMachine.plist.disk   This way you don't have to use codesudo/code with MarcoPolo (BTW you should really use ControlPlane which picks up where MarcoPolo left).  EDIT: emREMEMBER/em to have your original file back'd up when you do this.  <answer55910> Time Machine supports multiple backup volumes on Mountain Lion.     h3Backup to multiple locations/h3      Time Machine allows you to choose multiple backup locations and seamlessly switch between them. Now you can have a backup of your data at work and at home.   <comment37688> Which OSX version (Snow Leopard or Lion) are you using? <comment37741> What I'd really like is the ability to have more than one TM volume "active" at the same time. It works great with manual switching, but why is that necessary? <comment48373> You might want to have a look at the 'tmutil' command, especially at 'tmutil associatedisk'.
