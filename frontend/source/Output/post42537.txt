Why must I source .bashrc every time I open terminal for aliases to work? <body> I added this line into my code~/.bashrc/code file.  precodealias myserver='ssh davidfaux@davidfaux.com' /code/pre  However, when I open terminal and run codemyserver/code, terminal complains that  precode-bash: myserver: command not found /code/pre  When I source my .bashrc file, however, (code. .bashrc/code), the alias works.   Nonetheless, I do not want to source the file every time I open terminal for the alias to work. How do I make that happen?  <answer42709> In short you are putting your aliases in the wrong file .bashrc, that is why you need to keep running source to get the aliases working in any new login terminal instances.          By default, Terminal starts the shell via /usr/bin/login, which makes the shell a login shell. On every platform (not just Mac OS X) bash does not use .bashrc for login shells (only /etc/profile and the first of .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile that exists and is readable). This is why “put source ~/.bashrc in your .bash_profile” is standard advice. – Chris Johnsen      For More information see the manual page for bash. Then look under the INVOCATION section.  precodeman bash /code/pre  <answer146690> You can always put   precodeif [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ] &amp;&amp; [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ];then     source $HOME/.bashrc fi /code/pre  into the file code~/.profile/code or code~/.bash_profile/code on mac I think.  Oooor, you could just put your stuff in code.profile/code or code.bash_profile/code.  <comment48342> [This comment](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12993/why-doesnt-bashrc-run-automatically#comment13715_13019) explains the reason for this. That question tells you how to fix it. <comment48343> Thanks a lot! I did not know that starting the shell executes those files in order. Indeed, adding `. .bashrc` into `.bash_profile` works. <comment48401> @ughoavgfhw can/should you change your comment to an answer? That way it can be marked as an answer. <comment136004> Do I need to reboot in order to get things working? Because I added `source ~/.bashrc` to my .bash_profile, but I'm still facing the same issue... <comment136274> No in most cases you just need to open a new terminal window for the changes to take effect, the changes will only take effect in the newly opened window. <comment172824> This is noted in the other answer - why are you unsure about these things? <comment172889> Please read this very similar question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/12993/22003 and add there any improvment. <comment173426> @danielAzuelos Wait; do you want me to comment on the other page or update my answer based on the other question? <comment173428> @Mark I was just thinking in a very hypothetical sense - like what if someone's terminal process didn't know to source .profile? Their terminal probably would not start in the first place, but it is still possible.... like if someone was hacking around at their /usr/bin/login or something. <comment173441> → Dylan: please read this very similar question: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/12993/22003 and you'll find an answer to your "maybe?". <comment173443> Oh; ok. While there's probably a 99.9999999999% chance that profile will be source it hypothetically could not be. I could take it out if you want me to.
