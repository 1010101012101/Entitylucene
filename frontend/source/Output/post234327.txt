Unhide invisible files from the command line <body> By default, a number of system directories (such as ~/Library) are hidden in OS X (ie. they don't appear in Finder):  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fDUyr.png" alt="Library Folder"  I know I can do this through the GUI but I would like to add a script to my dotfiles that does this automatically for certain system directories.  Is it possible to remove the hidden flag for a file/directory from the command line?  <answer234328> h2For files hidden by prepended code./code/h2  To show:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder /code/pre  To hide:  precodedefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder /code/pre  emedit: as per RikerW's advice, to shorten these long strings into some shorter strings, add the following line to code~/.bash_profile/code from your favorite text editor:/em  precodealias showall='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES; killall Finder' alias hideall='defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles NO; killall Finder' /code/pre  emdo note that you will have to do codesource ~/.bash_profile/code to update your shell with the new aliases./em  hr  h2For files hidden from the GUI:/h2  To show:  precodesudo chflags nohidden /path/to/file /code/pre  To hide:  precodesudo chflags hidden /path/to/file /code/pre  Do bear in mind that this completely removes the codehidden/code flag.  <comment286464> Excellent, I was looking for the latter, but the first option is also good to know. Not sure if the ```sudo``` is strictly necessary though. <comment286465> It depends, really. `chflags` works if you're the owner of the file, and if you're not, then `sudo` is necessary. <comment286475> Would have accepted anyway, just needed to wait for the 10 minute lag to pass. Don't have enough reputation to upvote yet. <comment286526> Also note, adding a alias to `.bash_profile` is generally a good idea.  I have `showall` and `hideall` set to hide/show dotfiles.
