How would I connect the thunderbolt 3 Macbook pro with a Thunderbolt 2 monitor? <body> Yesterday Apple launched the new Macbook Pro with USB-C 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 ports, which I ordered already. At home I still have a fairly recent LG 34UC97s thunderbolt 2 display of a whopping â‚¬900. I only have to figure out how I'd connect them both?  So my question is: what are the current possibilities to connect a USB-C 3.1/Thunderbolt 3 port to a thunderbolt-2 monitor?  -  I already found this question, but the bottom-line of that topic is that a year ago there was no solution. One year later, what are the differences?  <answer259038> You could use something like the also newly-launched Apple Thunderbolt 3 USB-C to Thunderbolt 2 adapter. Apple's 12" MacBook has a USB-C port but does not integrate Thunderbolt into it, so Apple did not make a product which needed a Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter until now.
