Computer doesn't recognize hard drive for Time Machine <body> Using Macbook Pro with Yosemite 10.11.3.  For more than a year I have used a WD My Passport external hard drive (1 TB) for Time Machine.  Beginning two weeks ago when I plug in to get a Time Machine backup, the computer does not see the Passport.  I know the connection is good, because the light on the Passport comes on.  What gives?  <comment275664> You said, "Using Macbook Pro with Yosemite 10.11.3" and 10.11 is El Capitan, so is that what you're running? Just because the light comes on doesn't necessarily mean the WD My Passport is functioning properly.  Reboot the system with the drive attached and then when back at the Desktop run the following command in a Terminal and edit your question adding the output to it: `diskutil list` <comment275679> I concur.  A "light" just means that the WD Passport is getting power, not that your drive functions.  You can see if it gets mounted by running the command listed above or you can take a capture of what you see in *Disk Utility* by pressing Shift-Command-4 and selecting the area you want to capture.  Upload that picture to the question. <comment275685> It's necessary that we verify that the disk is indeed being seen by the computer. Open Disk Utility and see if it recognizes it: if not, run `diskutil list` in terminal and see if it shows up. If not, open System Profiler and see if it shows up under the USB device tree.
