OS X Server Wiki - unable to download attachments in Chrome <body> We've been using the wiki (currently running os x mountain lion) for a while now and most people seem to like it.  The attachments, however, don't seem to be downloadable or even "quick-view-able" in Chrome.    I checked in the chrome console and no JavaScript errors are being thrown.  Apple support told me to look through the Chrome support pages, but I haven't found much in the way of people talking about this.  I noticed that sprockets.js is saying that the log level is set to "error".  I have no idea how to change this to debug.  So, is there some other form of debugging that I'm missing here? Any suggestions welcome.  [UPDATE DATE=12-12-12]br I did some digging into Webkit and Safari to see if I could identify a simple fix.  In the end I just used a different wiki software.  It's too bad because people gave great reviews of the OS X wiki system right up until they tried to upload a file.  Also, it was really well integrated into the server, and very easy to admin.  Anyhoo, I'll leave this question unanswered in case someone else figures this out.br [/UPDATE]  <comment86736> Use Safari...:)
