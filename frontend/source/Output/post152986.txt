Restore new iPhone from jailbreak backup <body> In iTunes I have backups of my current jailbroken iPhone (iOS 7).  Can I setup new iPhone (from store, iOS 8, not jailbroken) from this backup? I don't care about Cydia and Cydia apps.  <answer152994> Yes, but a backup of a jailbroken device will restore all jailbreak data such as preference files and other data which will take up storage space on the device.
