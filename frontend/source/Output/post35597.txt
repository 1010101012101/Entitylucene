Quick switching to maximized application on Lion <body> I used to use spaces for quick switching between applications (I had a space with a browser, another with a terminal and yet another with an editor). For spaces I could have a keyboard shortcut. This way, I had a quick way to switch using a keyboard shortcut.  Lion introduced maximized applications. I find this a great feature, however, after maximization the application it is on its own space for which I do not know how to define a keyboard shortcut.  Could you give me a hint how to quickly, using a keyboard shortcut, access a maximized application on Lion?  Thank you!  <answer35615> Use Ctrl + the arrow keys:  strongCtrl + Right/strong: switch to next space / maximized app to the right.  strongCtrl + Left/strong: switch to next space / maximized app to the left  strongCtrl + Up/strong: Exposé / Mission control showing everything  strongCtrl + Down/strong: Exposé for just the windows of the current app  <answer42687> System Preferences:  Keyboard: Keyboard Shortcuts:  Select "Mission Control" on the left.  Scroll down to the "Mission Control" section on the right.  Turn on the check boxes next to the "Switch to Desktop x" entries.  <comment40549> I assume you don't have a multitouch trackpad, right? Isn't the application switcher Cmd+Tab fast enough? Otherwise you can create a shortcut to go left/right in Mission Control like in Snow Leopard. <comment40551> Cmd+Tab needs hitting the Tab more times. There applications like the browser, terminal and editor. I'd like to get to these in one step. I do not have a multitouch trackpad. <comment40552> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4788565/keyboard-shortcut-to-focus-on-an-app-in-mac-os
