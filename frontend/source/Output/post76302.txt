What software can find close duplicates from 2TB worth of pictures? <body> I have collected all of my photographs onto one hard drive. I'm looking for software that runs on Mountain Lion to assist in finding similar photos so I can review and eliminate redundant files.  My picture store is currently 2 TB, so batch and/or efficient software would be ideal. I emknow/em for certain that there are a lot of duplicates, and there are lots of programs out there which can find exact duplicates.  What I am looking for is something which will find:  ol lipictures which are identical except for rotation/li lipictures which are identical except for size (i.e. an original vs a thumbnail from iPhoto, or an original vs a downsized version for the web, etc)/li lipictures which are similar/li /ol  I assume #1 is possible, but I am not sure about #2 or #3. What software can do any or all of these tasks?  <answer76324> It's not exactly what you're looking for but it will help you easily find those duplicates :  http://macpaw.com/gemini  <answer76330> The best that I could find and have used is Duplicate Annihilator, which works with iPhoto, and is upgraded for 10.8.  You can download and do a run and hopefully get rid and clean your folders the first time through.  For what you need you might need a few passes to get the obvious dups, then find the harder to get ones.  http://www.brattoo.com/propaganda/  I am not exactly sure it will find your #2 and #3 right out of the gate, but since photos are marked with unique timestamps and other meta data, it should find them even if rotated.  The similar part is a bit harder as the criteria for similar could be many things.  Run through a few times first checking my filename, then maybe dimensions, creation date, etc.  KEY FEATURES  ul liDetects duplicates/li liDetects imported thumbnails/li liDetects missing images/li liEasily find and annihilate duplicates created internally by iPhoto or during import./li liCompare images using different algorithms to detect and understand differences./li liDetect duplicates using effective algorithms using electronic checksums like MD5./li liDetect duplicates by using file specific meta data such as filename, dimensions, filesize, Exif creation date or date of creation./li liDelete duplicates upon detection or mark them with a keyword to make them easily found using iPhoto features like search or smart folders.

I just found this and it looks really easy to use but the suggestion 'donlaur' gave is maybe more accurate for 'TJ Luoma' his problem than my solution. <comment88699> This is a good suggestion, however my pictures are not all in iPhoto, in fact most of them are not in iPhoto. <comment88780> That may be so, but you didn't ask for a solution outside of iPhoto.  Organizing them in iPhoto itself is a better solution than not using any particular software.  Importing them in all in one place, in itself, might remove some duplicates during import. <comment88930> #3 is a hard question. I know this, because I worked on a team that was responsible for keeping p0rn (and other bad stuff) off a social networking site. We could blacklist a particular photo, but then someone could change one pixel and upload again. However, think of this as a generalization of the advances in facial recognition software. <comment88968> That's a good point I hadn't thought of. Thanks.
