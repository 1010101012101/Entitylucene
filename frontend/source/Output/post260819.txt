How to enable curse words voice recognition in Google Keep app? <body> I can't find the definition to enable curse words voice recognition on my Google Keep app for iPad , iOS 10 .  It's not possible to change this ? I tested on multiple languages and it's using ***** for curse in multiple languages...  Can you help? Thank you!!!  <answer260929> Short of getting Google to allow you to transcribe words (check if you are in a school or work google account setting) you will need to use Apple's dictation if Google's doesn't let you curse.  <comment326559> Does that app allow you to use Apple's voice dictation feature in the built in keyboard? <comment326560> Thank you! I gonna try it, didn't remembered about that! <comment326567> Yeah it works with the keyboard, but using the microphone icon at Google keep using the specific function it doesn't work, how can I fix it? Thank you <comment326731> How do I configure that ? <comment326732> It's not a school or work account, this is actually my personal iPad.. thank you
