Changing yahoo messanger's status using mac terminal <body> Does anybody know how I can change my yahoo messenger's status using a command in mac terminal !? Or anything except the regular way to change it !? thanx  <answer3510> You could try to see if "Automator" would allow you to automate it, but I don't see any cmd line parameters to messenger on the mac.  <answer3517> Yahoo Messenger doesn’t provide an automation mechanism, however not all is lost. You can set set a keyboard shortcut for the statuses (they are in the menu) so you could do this:  Go to System Preferences, Keyboard - Keyboard Shortcuts, then from the list select “Application Shortcuts" then click “+” to add a new one.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3DcKn.jpg" alt="alt text"  Select Yahoo Messenger and strongtype the name of the command exactly as it appears in the yahoo statuses menu/strong. It is emcase sensitive/em. A simple typo will cause the shortcut to fail.  I.e.: “Busy" is not the same as "busy”.  Then set a key combination:  Look at mine:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3aDQb.jpg" alt="alt text"  strongDRAWBACK/strong: You need to have Yahoo active (i.e. focus) so the menu displayed belongs to yahoo. That means is not a “global shortcut”.  strongPLUS/strong: This method is useful for any other application/Command.
