Translation of words in spotlight <body> I am looking for an extension for spotlight on Yosemite, which allows an offline translation of english words into german and vice-versa. Similar to the inbuilt dictionary, but rather giving a translation of the word instead of a definition. It should also be lightweight, so not slowing the system or spotlight down.br Is there such a software?  <answer164627> This may not be quite what you're looking for, but have a look at Flashlight. It allows you to use plugins for Spotlight, including translation plugins. I don't think the translation ones are offline, but it's open source, so maybe you could figure out a way to download an offline translation dictionary and modify an existing plugin to use this offline dictionary?
