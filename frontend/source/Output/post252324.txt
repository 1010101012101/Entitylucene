Photos 1.5 Won't Export Video <body> Recorded some video on my iPhone and downloaded it to my iMac and now I'd like to share it online, either on my Facebook page or on Youtube. In Photos (Version 1.5 (370.42.0)) I select the video, choose Share and then choose Facebook. I get a status bar that tells me it's exporting to Facebook, but when it says it's completed, there's no video available. I tried simply Exporting the video to my desktop, so that I could choose the file from the website, but after I choose the appropriate folder and click Export, the sub window disappears and there's nothing on the selected folder. I've tried with the Export Unmodified as well, with the same results.  I've seen some other posts talking about rooting around to find the raw data file, but does anybody have any ideas as to why Photos isn't working like it's supposed to?
