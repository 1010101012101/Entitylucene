Macbook Pro reports "LAN Connectivity Failure" after being idle for seconds <body> My macbook pro (15", mid-2015) running OSX 10.11.6 is connected to the home network which is a DLink 7850U.  After rebooting the mac or router everything is fine, but after a while the mac network starts to become unresponsive (wifi icon shows connected, but no network traffic) after the machine does not use the internet for about 30sec - 1min. If there is continuos network traffic then this does not happen. Sometimes the connection returns after about 1 min.  The immediate way to get the network back working is either to turn off and on wifi or "Renew DHCP lease" in network settings. This will fix it untill next time the machine goes idle.  I ran the Wireless Diagnostics tool which shows "LAN Connectivity Failure", though all other network clients, incl. macbook, phones etc work without problem.  Are there any known connectivity issues with DLink or mac? What else can I do to get more hints regarding the disconnect issues?  <comment321457> I have not had this issue again after upgrading to MacOS Sierra
