Can you Recover Data from a Filevault encrypted harddrive externally? <body> My mac won't boot and it maybe a harddrive issue, but I need to get the data off it, is it possible to recover the data using a set of tools if I know the password and have the appropriate cables?  <answer150762> What Mac are you using (Macbook Air / Pro)? Does it have a replaceable disk?  If the disk is not replaceable, I see the following options:  ul liAccess your Mac in target mode and unlock the disk from another computer. For example this article explains the procedure./li liUsing recovery mode: Press codecmd + R/code : Recovery Mode/li liSame as above, but you manually select the recovery partition by pressing codealt/code at boot/li /ul  Sometimes the filevault2 volume cannot be opened easily. See here for a workaround.  If the disk is replaceable I would remove it, unlock the disk, and save the data e.g. with an USB-IDE adapter (like this one).  <comment177289> Did you try a boot repair? Cmd/r at startup? <comment177316> Yes, it cannot find the harddisk. It doesnt show up <comment177319> Can you tell if it's spinning up, checked cables are secure etc? <comment177408> cmd+r should connect to the internet if it doesn't find a disk. What Mac do you have?
