Boot Camp partition not listed in Windows Setup <body> I am trying to install Windows 8.1 (I have tried Windows 7). I put my USB stick and I used the Boot Camp assistant. Everything was copied with latest drivers, created Boot Camp partition. After that Mac restarted and booted into the windows installation. I run install process and it says something like: "Any media were not found." So in this stage my install journey ends. Because I don't know how to create an installation USB stick or how to see my ssd in installation. If I going back to OS X and check Disk Utility, the Boot Camp partition is there. So I don't understand why the installation can't find any partitions even drives.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tgefi.jpg" alt="Windows Setup"  Funny is if I try to find some drivers I can browse for them and I see the the HD-partition and folder like an Users, Documents, Program Files, etc.  My SSD is Crucial M4 256GB with latest firmware and used Mavericks by fresh installation. I am running on Mac Mini mid-2011 2.7 Ghz.  <comment139160> I'm not sure this is related. I recently had to fight to get Windows 8.1 installed via Bootcamp. Not same error you're getting. It turned out to be the USB stick. It was brand new 32 GB stick but BootCamp did not like it for some reason. It would get 99.9% way through installation and then tank. I'm only commenting on this because I would hate to see you spend hours on something as simple as just trying a different USB stick. Good luck. <comment139434> Well I am 100% sure that my USB stick works well and I did the Windows installation before. I did some research and I have suspicion that when you have got fresh OS X  Mavericks, there is something missing what windows need to find any HDD.
