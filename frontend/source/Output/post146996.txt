How to mitigate Bash risk while waiting for a patch (sans a recompile)? <body> This is related to How do I recompile Bash to avoid the remote exploit CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169?, Are Macs vulnerable to the Bash shellshock bug? and Are Bash, Bourne, and Korn shells compiled into one binary in OSX?.  Apple has not released a patch for 10.8.5, and there's no telling if/when they will patch the defective software.  I don't want to download and compile a version of Bash because version headaches. For example, I might place a new copy in code/usr/local/bin/code, but other software may be hardwired for Bash in code/usr/code. Or I might replace code/bin/bash/code and some unintended consequence might arise, like Apple refusing to update my version of Bash.  How does one mitigate the vulnerable emwithout/em compiling and patching?  <answer148261> There is a patch for Mountain Lion, see http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1768.
