Why are some tracks in my iTunes grayed out? <body> strongNote:/strong There seems to have been quite a few threads on grayed out tracks on iTunes but none of them seem to be relevant with my question/issue.  strongContext/strong: I have just subscribed to Apple Music about 2 weeks ago for the first time. Still on trial period.   As shown in the image below, these are the 2 albums I added to my library from Apple Music. The first album, I also download the physical files, whereas the second album I do not download for offline listening.  Track 10 for first album is grayed out for some reason, while track 4 for the second album is grayed out.  Both songs are playable. I have no issues playing them despite being shown in gray.   What is it indicating?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HdcEM.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer226184> I finally found a solution to this. If you sort by song you can see a check mark next to most songs but the greyed out ones won't be checked. Just make all songs checked and they work again. Hopefully this helps you and others with a similar problem.  <comment278169> That actually works! Thanks. But, what does the checkmark actually mean?
