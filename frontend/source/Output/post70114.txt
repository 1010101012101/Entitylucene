OS X 10.8 seems to break printer communications <body> Anyone using a Kodak ESP 7250 with OS X 10.8?  Everything worked fine until I upgraded to 10.8. I have two computers and they both systematically stopped printing and scanning immediately after updating OS X.   ul liI've tried Kodak support a few times but they are absolutely NO help. /li liI've installed the latest updates for printer and computer. /li liI have followed Kodak's troubleshooting steps. /li liI have tried USB and WiFi. /li liI have played with my firewall. /li /ul  Nothing. Just thought I would throw out a message here and see if anyone has had similar issues that got passed it.  Thanks  <answer70146> This happened to me with my Epson after upgrading to Mountain Lion. Not for a while did I realize, I was emnot/em following Epson's onsite directions to the letter, and when I did, everything began to work just fine.
