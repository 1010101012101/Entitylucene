Change shortcut to change input source (keyboard language) <body> I'm trying to change the keyboard combination to change the input source from Option-Command-Space / Command-Space to any other combination. I am not able to find any solution for that. Is it possible to change this combination?   <answer238218> Here are Apple's instructions for changing shortcuts found in PH21531:  ol liChoose Apple menu  System Preferences, click Keyboard, then click Shortcuts./li liSelect the action (Input Sources in your case) in the list that you want to change./li liDouble-click the current shortcut, then press the new key combination you want to use./li /ol  You cannot use each type of key (for example, a letter key) more than once in a key combination.  ol start="4" liQuit and restart any apps youâ€™re using for the new keyboard shortcut to take effect./li /ol  <comment291994> The standard shortcut is a shortcut in Eclipse as well. I would like to keep the shortcut in Eclipse and change the one for input source.
