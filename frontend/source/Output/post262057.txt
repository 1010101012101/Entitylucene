Built in trackpad no registering click events on a specific area of the screen. How do I fix this? <body> Alright, so around the center of my screen my mouse will not work. I can move it there, but I have to click a good 10 times to get anything to register. And it's really just a little area in the center of my screen- but this area just so happens to be where things like pop-up messages in Sims show up and things like that, so any advice would be much appreciated.  I've already tried plugging in a USB mouse, checking for software updates, removing adware &amp; malware, and even turning off Bluetooth. None of which has helped.   Also, I'm running Sierra and I'm not sure if this is relevant but my entire computer has been experiencing delays to some degree recently, primarily in things like youtube video continuing only in audio but the image stopping and things being slower to load.
