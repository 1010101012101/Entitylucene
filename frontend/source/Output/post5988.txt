Automatically launch a program or action when an external drive or disk is connected <body> I have an external drive. Is it possible to launch a program or perform an action when I connect it or plug it in?  <answer5989> Marco Polo can perform actions (you specify) based on attached USB devices.  Edit: MarcoPolo isn't supported anymore, but there is a maintained fork of it: ControlPlane  <answer5990> A similar question has been posted in the MacRumors forum here:  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1029207  The specific suggestion there is to use the application MarcoPolo.  <answer13724> The likely most robust solution is to create a codelaunchd/code job with the codeStartOnMount/code property set to code-boolean YES/code:     codeStartOnMount &lt;boolean&gt;/codebr   This optional key causes the job to be started every time a filesystem is mounted.   This is how Time Machine does it (see code/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-attach.plist/code).  You need to check if the desired code/Volume/.../code is available, but in my experience, it's faster than using Folder Actions.  <comment6235> Thank, it works! Steps to configure Marco Polo: (1) Create a context, e.g. `DTVP` (2) Plug the drive, create a *USB* rule for this context and increase its confidence to 100% (3) Setup an *Open* action for `/Volumes/DTVP/Mac/DTVP.app`.
