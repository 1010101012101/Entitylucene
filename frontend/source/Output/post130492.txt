How do I remove the 'Quit' action from an application on OSX <body> I'm looking for a way to remove the 'quit' action from an application, so I personally cannot close it manually (except by force closing (Cmd+opt+esc).  strongCase/strongbr emI've got Wunderlist as my personal To-Do list and use it on Full-screen on a second workspace on my Mac. I simply swipe (4fingers) to the left to quickly access my tasks. Too bad I've got a second habit: quitting/closing an application (Cmd+Q) when I'm done. This often results in closing Wunderlist and having to restart the application. Although this ain't a hassle, I think it can be solved/em  So I'd simply repeat: Is there a way to protect an application from being closed (perhaps except when force closing, but at least prevented from closing via CMD+Q)?  Perhaps this could be done by removing the keyboard-shortcut from a specific application via Application services via the menubar, but than i'd also be looking for the context of the function name I've to input.  <answer130493> In system preferences you can go to strongkeyboard/shortcuts./strong  brimg src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/r5j6K.png" alt="shortcuts" brbrIn the list on the left side click: strongapp shortcuts and create a new shortcut./strong Pick Wunderlist and for menu item pick stop or close wunderlist just type it exactly like it is typed in the menu in wunderlist. in the last field put a custom key code and save.brbr img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/suMYy.png" alt="setup"brbr Like I did for safaribr this should do the trick  <comment152983> Just as I thought. Just wondered what the context of the function should've been, but didn't knew it was just the text as in the menu bar. I'ts solved now, both CMD+Q and CMD+W have been 'removed'. Thanks! <comment152985> You're welcome! "menu title" is indeed a bit cryptic
