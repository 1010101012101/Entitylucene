File path error in Applescript/TextExpander <body> I use the following code to open my dropbox folder quickly using textexpander.  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     set f to POSIX file "/Users/MrT/Dropbox"     open f end tell /code/pre  Which works, but then I want to go deeper in my folders using this code. It does not work. It looks like Textexapnder does not recognize spaces in file paths.  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     set f to POSIX file "/Users/MrT/Dropbox/School/Hardvard/6-Fall Session 2013"     open f end tell /code/pre  <answer106190> I might be totally off track, but give this a try:  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     set f to "Users/MrT/Dropbox/School/Hardvard/6-Fall Session 2013"     set a to POSIX file f     open a end tell /code/pre  If that fails to work, change it to the following:  precodetell application "Finder"     activate     set f to "Macintosh HD:Users:MrT:Dropbox:School:Hardvard:6-Fall Session 2013"     set a to POSIX file f     open a end tell /code/pre  <comment124543> Works here, are you sure the path is correct (e.g. Hard*v*ard instead of Harvard)? Instead of TextExpander, you can also use AppleScript Editor to test the snippet directly. <comment124555> @patrix Yes I am sure, I copy pasted the path from the GetInfo. Still not working <comment124556> It works on Applescript, but not in TextExpander <comment124557> Just for testing purposes: Can you rename your Dropbox path on your drive to not include any spaces (and adjust the TE code accordingly) and try again? <comment124558> I tested without space and without space+no "-" character Still not working
