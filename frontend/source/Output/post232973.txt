iPhone won't open Safari - or other - pages <body> Has anyone found a fix to this yet? I have upgraded to IOS 9.3. I have reset my iPhone. But it still won't open links.  <answer232978> This seems to be a bug in iOS 9. Not much to do but wait for an update.  <comment285148> IOS9.3.1 is out and it fixed the problem.
