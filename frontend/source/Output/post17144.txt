Is there a keyboard shortcut for inserting MathType equations in Pages? <body> I have more and more thoughts about taking my class notes on my computer, and Pages '09 would seem like a good candidate for that task. However, being that I have a lot of technical classes, I find myself needing to insert MathType equations very often.  Is there a keyboard shortcut to insert such an equation? If not, can I somehow make one?  <answer17145> FastScripts is my choice to easily make key shortcuts for accessing menu items - much nicer, more flexible and far more powerful than the keyboard preference pane. Also, LaunchBar works wonders for fast switching apps / activating services and learns your preferred key shortcuts on the go rather than having to program them in beforehand (but you can do that too if you like).  <comment18691> You might want to check this question as well: http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/14431/6303 <comment18694> @Tigran Khanzadyan, that's quite interesting as I know a fair deal of LaTeX (to the point I've been using MathType as a LaTeX equation parser).
