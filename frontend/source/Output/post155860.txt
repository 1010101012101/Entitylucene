I changed the Graphics Card and fixed the problem. There is a very well written tutorial on how to change the Card on iFixit. The only problem would be to find a replacement Card - i paid about 360$ for mine.  <comment190909> Before repairing the mac, bring it to an apple authorised service provider to verify that it is the memory of the graphics card.
