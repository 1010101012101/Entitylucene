How can I tell Time Machine to keep using its former backup? <body> For some reason Time Machine doesn't think that the backups on my external drive are for my current computer.  How can I point Time Machine at the former backup files so it can pick up where it left off?  <answer168606> On OS X 10.7 Lion or later, yes. You need to look at the codetmutil/code command, specifically the codeinheritbackup/code verb (which tells Time Machine that this is a backup of emthis/em machine, and not some other), and the codeassociatedisk/code verb (which tells Time Machine that the disk it emwas/em backing up before is this other disk that you have now).
