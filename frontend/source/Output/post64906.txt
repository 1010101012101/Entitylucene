Is there a way to force a remote refresh via the iOS Remote Web Inspector? <body> I'm using iOS 6's new remote web inspector feature, which is pretty nice.   Is there a way of forcing a page refresh on the remote iOS device from the desktop - it's just a bit easier then reaching over and refreshing the page on the device itself.   <answer64908> OK, figured it out, it's a bit kludgy, but works.  In the javascript console (the single line at the bottom of the web inspector) - type this:  precodedocument.location.reload(); /code/pre  This forces a page reload on the remote device.   <comment76258> Cool. I didnâ€™t know there was a javascript console. I will delete my answer.
