Repeating Reminders on desktop won't stay in sync with iOS <body> When I create a reminder that is set to repeat, for example:  precode"take out the garbage" repeat every 2 weeks. /code/pre  it pops up on my phone and on my desktop.   When I check it off on my phone, my computer never gets the message that it was checked off. If I check it off on my computer, my phone never gets the message that it was checked off.  I'm running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and iOS 6.0.1 on an iPhone 4S.   This has never worked for me and I've been through several versions of each OS.  Any suggestions?  <answer71386> I fixed this.  On iOS I went to SETTINGS  ICLOUD  Turned Reminders OFF, then ON. It warned me that it would delete my reminders.. No big deal as they are still stored on iCloud.  On OSX I went to System Preferences...  iCloud  unchecked Calendars &amp; Reminders ( it again warned me that it would delete them from computer which is okay because they are stored on iCloud)  Checked Calendars &amp; Reminders (to turn them back on.)  It is now working as expected. Weird...  <comment82250> Reminders supports iCloud but does not require it. Have you checked on your iPhone that Reminders is using iCloud? Go to Settings  iCloud and ensure Reminders is on. <comment82354> bneely , I checked and it is on. I assumed it was though because when I create a reminder on my phone, it will show on my computer and vice versa.
