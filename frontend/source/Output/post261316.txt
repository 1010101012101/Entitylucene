There's a ton of details missing from this question that would help in helping you like the make/model of your external display, what adapter you are using to connect to the monitor, the specific model (i.e year) of your MacBook, which version of macOS you are using, etc.  Remember, we're not there to look over your shoulder. <comment327300> @Allan Added all the details. <comment327305> If i connect to the external monitor flickering is not happening. But if i disconnect it from the external monitor it's flickering again. <comment327564> What if you turn off the monitor *then* disconnect?  Does it behave differently?
