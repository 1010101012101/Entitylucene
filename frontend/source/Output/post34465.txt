Installed reFIT on Lion and now I can't login <body> I installed reFIT on my new MBP, and now, unfortunately, OSX can't get past the login screen. When I try logging in, it simply bounces me back to where I started, the login page.  Since I can't get in to OSX, I can't delete the code/efi/code folder as recommended. Is there any way for me to fix this so I can at least get back into OSX to fix things?   <answer34483> If you strongdisable journaling/strong for the Macintosh partition (in order to access files from within Linux) this should work:  ol lihold kbd&#x2325;/kbd upon boot/li liselect strongRecovery HD/strong OR boot from Mac install DVD/USB /li liopen Disk Utility.
