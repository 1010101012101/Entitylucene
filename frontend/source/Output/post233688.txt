iPhone 6 mail app crashes when trying to unsubscribe from newsletter <body> The iPhone mail app of my collegue crashes when he tries to unsubscribe from any newsletter. The app completely freezes and needs to be restarted.   He has an iPhone 6 plus with iOS 9.3.1 installed.  The mail account is based on exchange 2010.  What could be causing this problem? Is there any thing we can try to fix this?  <comment285560> Hi @Tetsujin after receiving further clarification on the problem, the issue didn't exist until he updated to iOS 9.3.1. So this issue started after applying the update to iOS 9.3.1.. <comment285569> Is he using the stock mail app?  Or something like the outlook (or another) app? <comment285606> What exactly is your colleague doing to unsubscribe? Clicking on a link? What happens if he presses on the link until the popup appears and then selects either Open or Copy? <comment285665> He is using the apple stock mail app. If he clicks on a link the mail app freezes immediately. No popup appears, the app just freezes
