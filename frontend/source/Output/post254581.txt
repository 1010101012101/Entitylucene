Preview .dat files with Quick Look <body> I would like get a quick look of .dat, .pbs files in Finder as text files. In general I would like to see all these files as text. They appear as icons, in contrast to other text files such as .txt, .rtf, .m, .c and so on.    Thanks  <comment316966> This is a reasonable request.  However, often such files are binary data rather than text information.  Since I am using the Terminal so often anyway, I generally just open the containing folder in Terminal (using [Alfred's File Actions feature](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/file-search/#file-actions)), run the `file` command on the file to see if it's "text" information, and then run `less` on the file to page through the output.
