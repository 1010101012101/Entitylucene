Focus most recent window of pid without requiring accessibility approval <body> I currently use this AppleScript to try to set focus to the most recent window of a PID, in example here my pid is code450/code.  precodetell application "System Events"   set frontmost of the first process whose unix id is 450 to true end tell /code/pre  This works wonderfully in that it doesn't ask for accessibility approval. The quirks though are:  ul liIt ignores minimized windows, thus if all windows are minimized, nothing is focused/li liIf you have windows across multiple spaces, and last accessed window was in space X. If you are in space Y and have windows of that app in space Y, it will focus the most recently used in space Y./li liI haven't encountered it yet, but apparently people say if a window of other applications are on top of the window, it won't come to top./li /ul  I know of codeperform action AXRaise/code however this needs accessibility api approval. My users of my addon are asking to remove this as many of them struggle with allowing the single app access, especially if the miss granting it on the first popup.  So this was done in applescript, if you know how to do it in carbon (core-foundation, core-graphics) or cocoa I can use that to.  In osx 10.9 the codeAXMakeProcessTrusted/code was deprecated otherwise I could have used that to grant my app access without bothering users and then use codeAXUIElementSetAttributeValue/code to bring a window to the front.  Please help Thanks  <answer151422>  This fixes the first quirk but not the second one:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "System Events"     bundle identifier of process 1 whose id is 1234 end tell tell application id result     reopen     activate end tell /code/pre  The same applies to codeopen/code:  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codeopen -a "$(ps -p 1234 -o comm=)" /code/pre  If there are no open windows, codereopen/code opens a new default window, and if all windows are minimized, codereopen/code unminimizes one window. codeactivate/code makes the application frontmost.  codeactivate/code and setting codefrontmost/code to true raise all windows but codeopen -a/code only raises one window.  I thought  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codelsappinfo launch ASN="$(lsappinfo find pid=1234)" /code/pre  might also work, but I'm getting a segfault when trying to launch an already running application.  <comment178162> Thank you so so much!! I was struggling with this! I will test this out tomorrow and report back. :) So the third issue (third bullet) i mentioend isn't an issue huh? <comment178164> Someone told me to try this to get most recent window but I think it uses accessibility huh? `tell (1st window whose value of attribute "AXMain" is true) *(linebreak)* set theWindow to value of attribute "AXTitle" *(linebreak)* end tell` <comment197543> Hi there friend, i think there is a mis type in the first script. I think it should be `1 whose unix id is 1234` note the unix. above it is just `1 whose id is 1234` (wihtout the unix) can you please verify <comment197545> Can you please share some light on the `open -a "$(ps -p 1234 -o comm=)"` method please. I ran that from terminal, I have to firefox's running. One pid is 303 and the other is 475. Both PIDs with this method are focusing the PID of 303. Do you think it's because I opened the second firefox, from a command from the first firefox? Here is my ps dump: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Noitidart/ef5d2fa9e526ec93d761/raw/b435ffb577d7dd1085bb770b1b511e25542900f1/gistfile1.txt thank you sir! <comment197546> Hi there sir again, after further testing, both methods shared in this solution, `open -a` and the applescript both seem to target a single process of firefox. So interesting. My script at top doesn't have this. I strongly believe its because i am opening the second instance of firefox from the first instance, do you think this is true? Any ideas on how to fix?
