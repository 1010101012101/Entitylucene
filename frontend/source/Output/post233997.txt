macbook key ... center works but sides dont <body> A few keys on the left side of my macbook pro (2011) do not work perfectly. If I press exactly on the center, it works. But if I press the corners, even if its pressed all the way, it does not print the letter. The letters I see the issue are e r d and s. I opened and checked, there was no dirt stuck.  I went to the genius bar who opened the letter e and put it back. Still does not work perfectly. He is saying it will cost $230 to change. Is there something I can do. Its a minor inconvenience. With the key mechanism all in place, I am thinking its a minor adjustment I need to do to make it work fine.   Your suggestions please.   <answer234010> There are small, raised rubber pieces under each keyboard key. When those are depressed, that causes the letter to be typed out.  If you're only able to use the keys when you press directly in the center, it's likely that those rubber pieces are not making good contact with the circuit board underneath.  Your options are to alter the way you type (that is, aim for the center and press harder), or allow Apple to replace the keyboard altogether as they suggested.
