What Apple Watch sleep tracking app uses minimal battery power and is fully compatible with the iOS Health app? <body> I want to use an Apple Watch 2 to track my sleep. In order to achieve this I will need to wear the Apple Watch during sleep, which creates an issue around battery usage. So my thinking is that I can put the watch on charge twice daily on most days: in the morning while getting ready for work and again at night while getting ready for bed. By doing this I estimate the battery will have enough power to keep the watch going 24/7 on most days.  Obviously this means I need a sleep tracking app to do the tracking. My requirements are:  ul liIt must be highly efficient in terms of battery usage/li liIt can track sleep while the watch is in Airplane mode/li liIt can synchronise data with the iOS Health app on my iPhone/li liIt must be able to provide a summary of my sleep on the Apple Watch itself/li /ul  strongNOTES:/strong  ul liI do not mind paying for the App if doing so results in me getting a much better product/li liI am open to using 3rd party devices if it means the quality of tracking/measurements are much higher/li liWhile not a requirement, if the app also supports syncing data with other HealthKit apps that would be a plus/li /ul  I did consider posting this in the Software Recommendations community, but it didn't seem to have the appropriate tags.   <comment320122> I use [Sleep++ by Cross Forward Consulting](https://appsto.re/us/ZEv59.i). I've been pretty happy with it. It syncs with HealthKit. Check out the screenshots and see if that does what you need. <comment335591> @Monomeeth I'm interested in doing this same thing. How has your experience been with the app you chose?  Did it meet your requirements? <comment335600> My experience has been pretty good. Sleep++ is certainly power efficient and meets my other 'must have' requirements. It's **not** perfect (e.g. you need to manually start/stop sleep tracking, and there's no heart tracking during sleep). But it's _free_ (with ads) so you can give it a good try before paying to remove ads. It's also fairly well supported (someone I know was having problems, but a quick email got everything sorted). For me, I found giving the Apple Watch a charge while I'm in the shower/getting ready for bed and again in the morning while getting ready for work is enough. <comment335601> I've also had reports that HeartWatch is an extremely good app (it's not free, but  is more than just a sleep tracker _and_ also tracks your heart during sleep).  I'm seriously considering purchasing it. As an aside, Apple is working on a native sleep tracking app, so I'm looking forward to seeing what they come up with (although it may not be ready for watchOS 4) and I'm not sure what limitations (if any) it will face with current hardware. <comment371193> Did you purchase HeartWatch in the end? How was your experience with *that*? Maybe you can add an answer to your own question. <comment371930> @SkeletonBow Sorry, I somehow missed your comment. No, I didn't purchase HeartWatch in the end. I decided to stick with Sleep++ until Apple offers their own solution. Hoping for an Apple Watch 3 announcement sooner than expected. :)
