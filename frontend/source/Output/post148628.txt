Mac Mail - move IMAP message to Exchange folder <body> In Mac mail I have most of my email accounts set up Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, and Exchange (office365 hosted).  When I try to move any of my messages from the first 3 (all IMAP accounts) into my Exchange Folder (where I archive everything), it gives me the error can't move message.  Is there any solution?  <answer148632> I don't know what is causing the error, but I can tell you where on the filesystem you can find your messages. Perhaps you can move them manually in Finder?  The default location for mailboxes is:  code~/Library/Mail/V2//code  in Finder, choose strongGo To Folder/strong from the strongGO/strong menu or use the shortcut code⬆︎⌘G/code and paste that path into the dialog box.  That folder should contain folders for each of your mail accounts, each containing mailbox folders with labels like codeINBOX.mbox/code which are simply folders themselves. You'll likely have to traverse down several levels of folders with arbitrary names before you reach a codeData/code folder containing a codeMessages/code folder which is where you will finally find your email messages. Hope that helps you out.  <comment175034> Which is the exact error message? <comment175036> It may not answer the exact question you asked, but I use MigrationWiz - https://www.bittitan.com/products/#migrationwiz - when Mail gives me issues.  In my professional experience, it's not worth the time it would take you to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue.  Pay MigrationWiz like $12 and have them move what you want.  Done.  In the hours you'll save, you can make a lot more than that.
