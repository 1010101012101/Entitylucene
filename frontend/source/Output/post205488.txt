Can I get a male Thunderbolt to female USB 3.0 adapter? <body> I have an early 2011 MacBook Pro that has now 1 terabyte of storage, but want to connect a external hard drive via the fastest connection possible. It didn't come with USB 3.0 but 2x USB 2.0 and Thunderbolt port. Can I get a male Thunderbolt to female USB 3.0 adapter?  <answer205711> The Thunderbolt port on your MacBook Pro is already faster than USB 3 so the fastest possible connection of an external storage device would be to attach a Thunderbolt drive via the Thunderbolt port.  Note that Thunderbolt is a faster interface than a hard disk can accept or push data so for top speed you will either need a RAID configured for speed or an SSD drive.  <answer213197> You can simply buy a Thunderbolt external hard drive like this durable and portable one from LaCie. Be aware that these drives tend to be more expensive, but by the time you've bought a USB3.0 to Thunderbolt adapter and hard drive, you're better off going for the native Thunderbolt drive with USB3.0 connectivity as well.  <answer214292> You can find now @ amazon or ebay http://www.ebay.com/itm/Thunderbolt-Port-to-USB-3-0-Super-Speed-Hard-Disk-Drive-Adapter-Dongle-for-Apple-/141776189587  <comment247803> The 2011 MacBook Pro has a thunderbolt port.
