What is killing iPhones so they have no power and read 0.006 current? <body> At our repair centre we sometimes receive iPhones that have No Power and when we measure the current they're taking it's just 0.006 or a similar very low value.  They have no liquid damage or any other type of damage when we inspect them and they cannot be fixed in any way.  I wonder why is this happening, are they being connected to a faulty nor non-Apple charger?
