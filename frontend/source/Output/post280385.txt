Transferring files between two Apple ID accounts <body> I am currently in a joint Apple ID account and I'd like to transfer the files and data in my iPhone to a new individual account I created. My iCloud storage is completely full up on the joint account.   Q: strongIs there a way to transfer my data onto my Mac or a new iCloud server so I can put them onto my new Apple ID account?/strong  <answer280400> I guess each Apple ID has a dedicated iCloud account.
