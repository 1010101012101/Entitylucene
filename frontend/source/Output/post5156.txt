key combo to toggle showing hidden items <body> Is there a key combination I can use to show/hide hidden items in Finder?  <answer5157> I don't think you can do this by default.  I myself use Hidden Files widget. it's so easy to use.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6XdEG.jpg" alt="alt text"  <answer5158> You can do it with two small shell scripts:  This will reveal the "invisible" files:  precode#!/bin/sh # make invisible files visible defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE killall Finder /code/pre  This will hide the "invisible" files made visible:  precode#!/bin/sh # make visible files invisible defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE killall Finder /code/pre  Save each into an appropriately named file, set their executable bits using codechmod/code, then you can run them to set or unset the visibility.  Alternately, you could use the following code, and toggle back and forth by executing the code repeatedly:  precode#!/bin/sh  showFiles=`defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles` if [ "$showFiles" = 1 ]  then defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool FALSE  else defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool TRUE fi  killall Finder /code/pre  <answer5315> I have an AppleScript I use to toggle things like these off and on:  http://www.markdouma.com/developer/ToggleInvisibleFiles.zip  The code:  precodeproperty showAllFiles : missing value -- missing value is AppleScript equivalent of nil or NULL  try     set showAllFiles to (do shell script "/usr/bin/defaults read -g AppleShowAllFiles") on error     set showAllFiles to "0" end try  tell application "Finder" to quit  if showAllFiles = "0" then     do shell script "/usr/bin/defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 1"     say "AppleShowAllFiles 1"     --say "Now showing invisible files" else if (showAllFiles = "1") then     do shell script "/usr/bin/defaults write -g AppleShowAllFiles 0"     say "AppleShowAllFiles 0"     --say "Now hiding invisible files" end if  tell application "Finder" to activate /code/pre  (Note, you can open up the downloaded AppleScript by dragging it to the icon of AppleScript Editor.app).  I generally prefer to tell applications to quit rather than kill them (though, with the sudden termination feature introduced in 10.6, that can sometimes be the same thing).  Oh, mine differs from Greg's in that I set it for the global preference domain (so that it affects all apps, including the Open and Save dialogs). (Though you can always toggle invisible files off or on in Open or Save panels using Command-Shift-period ).  <comment20438> No - it's not a thing Finder wants to do at run time. There are plenty of ways to automate changing the hidden preference and killing finder - launchd will make a new finder which will read the changed settings - but it's more like substituting in a new player in a sports match.
