Insert date via text expansion / shortcut key <body> I've been using aText which is a small text expansion app for this - it's become pretty ropey on new OSX versions so I've given up. I've also been using the trial of the new TextExpander which is great, though it's billed monthly now and seems like overkill considering all I want to do is insert a date! My requirement is: if I type a short string like 'dd' or use a certain keyboard shortcut combination, I should have today's date output like so:  [ Jul 8 ]  I've fiddled with apple scripts etc to try and get this working, but no luck. Surely there's something out there that I've missed. Or a better Applescript that actually works :)
