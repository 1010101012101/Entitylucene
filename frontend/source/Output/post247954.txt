What is the 'If Finder Window Open, Then...' AppleScript code? <body> I am creating a 'Quit All' keyboard shortcut. I have the Quit All Applications system command and the AppleScript to close open Finder windows (without it, Finder windows stay open). However, if no Finder window is open, an error sound plays every time. I therefore need to code the script to check if there are any open Finder windows, and if this is the case, to then close them. Here is the code I have so far:  precodetell application "Finder" to activate tell application "System Events"     keystroke "w" using {command down, option down} end tell /code/pre  Just missing the "if open Finder windows then" part at the beginning. Could someone help me for this line of code?  <answer247968> You can use the following AppleScript emcode/em to avoid an error if Finder doesn't have any windows open.  hr  pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"codetell application "Finder"     activate     if exists window 1 then         tell application "System Events"             keystroke "w" using {command down, option down}         end tell     end if end tell /code/pre
