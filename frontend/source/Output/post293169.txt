Selective cleanup of Safari Cache <body> Although I've set Safari to accept cookies "from current page only," the ubiquity of advertising (even with a blocker) means I have dozens if not hundreds of cookies from domains I've never heard of.  So I found and downloaded a tool that lets me delete all cookies not on a whitelist.  Now it would be nice to do something similar with the caches.  Since cached pages and images now have GUID filenames, I can no longer use a script that looks for the domain name as part of the filename.  Is there an API that I can use?  Or better yet, something already created?
