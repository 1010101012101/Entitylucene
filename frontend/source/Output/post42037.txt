Is there a way to have AppleScript output displayed in the menubar? <body> Before reading further: I know about butler and similar programs.  I am looking for a BUILT-IN way to do this without a third party app.  Anyway, I wrote an AppleScript that runs a shell command.  I want to display that output in the menubar at the top... without Butler how can I do this?  <answer44781> As a generality, without a third party program, such as Growl, there is no built in way to do this.  However, you could write a script or other program such as one I found here that provides the menulet service for you.  I'm sure that Growl integration would be much easier to accomplish.  <answer49618> There isn't a built in way to do this in OS X. However, using Growl, you can have notifications. Here's a sample script for that:  precode--Make sure Growl is running tell application "System Events"     set isRunning to (count of (every process whose bundle identifier is "com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp")) &gt; 0 end tell  if isRunning then     tell application id "com.Growl.GrowlHelperApp"         set the allNotificationsList to ¬             {"Test Notification", "Another Test Notification"}         --Notifications can be enabled in System Preferences&gt;Growl&gt;Applications&gt;Display Options         set the enabledNotificationsList to ¬             {"Test Notification"}         register as application ¬             "Growl AppleScript Sample" all notifications allNotificationsList ¬             default notifications enabledNotificationsList ¬                     -- Set the icon. You can use any icon from any application             icon of application "AppleScript Editor"          notify with name ¬             "Test Notification" title ¬             "Test Notification" description ¬             "This is a test AppleScript notification." application name "Growl AppleScript Sample"          notify with name ¬             "Another Test Notification" title ¬             "Another Test Notification :) " description ¬             "Alas — you won't see me until you enable me..." application name "Growl AppleScript Sample"      end tell end if /code/pre  That should display this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WunT2.jpg" alt=""  And if you have the other notification enabled too:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WunT2.jpg" alt="" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/m4NSk.jpg" alt=""  More advanced techniques are described here.
