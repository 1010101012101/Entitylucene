Font properties of text layer in PSD file -- possible to inspect without Photoshop? <body> I want inspect (and just that, without editing this layer) which font, size, color etc. were used in a given text layer in PSD file created with Photoshop. Is this doable without Photoshop.app? Pixelmator seems to be unable to accomplish that, same with Acorn. Anything else I could try?  <answer17019> For rather raw data, try saving this as, e.g. codepsdtext.py/code  precode#!/usr/bin/python  import sys, re  input = sys.argv[1]  # This write_title function is just for vanity and easier manual searching def write_title(num):   filler = 97   if num &lt; 10:     filler2 = filler - 25   elif num &lt; 100:     filler2 = filler - 26   else:     filler2 = filler - 27   print("\n" * 2)   print("#" * filler)   print("#" * filler)   print("#" * 11 + " Text layer " + str(num) + " " + "#" * filler2)   print("#" * filler)   print("#" * filler)   print("\n" * 2)    def psd_texts(input):   t = x = 0   for line in open(input, 'r'):     if re.search("^\s+/Text\s+.*", line):       x = 1       t += 1       write_title(t)       print(line.rstrip('\n'))     elif x == 1:       if "warp" in line:         x = 0       elif "&gt;&gt;" not in line and "&lt;&lt;" not in line:         print(line.rstrip('\n'))   if __name__ == "__main__":   psd_texts(input) /code/pre  Then make it runnable: code$ chmod a+x psdtext.py/code  Save the output as a file*: code$ ./psdtext.py my_file_with_text_layers.psd &gt; textinfo.txt/code   Open in an editor: code$ open textinfo.txt/code  For example: you can search for code/Text/code in your editor to loop through the text content of different layers, or search for code/FontSet/code to loop through the fonts (the first font listed is the one the layer uses, others are fallbacks)  I know the output is ugly, but hey, it contains all the info.  hr  *) I wouldn't do just code$ ./psdtext.py file.psd/code as it visually messes up the Terminal â€” try e.g. code$ ./psdtext.py file.psd | less/code instead.  <comment18550> Wow, thanks, maybe not the most convenient way, but with a little patience I should get all all the info I need ;)
