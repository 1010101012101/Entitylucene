Safari PDF Issue <body> When I try to load a PDF in Safari I am getting some odd Asian (sorry I don't know what dialect) type in the loading window. My best guess is there is a font substitution occurring but I really don't know what is going on.   If there is a faint issue, maybe I have the needed font turned off? What font is the loader looking for.  If not a font issue, what is happening?  (Bonus: What language is it? And what does it say?)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hwEah.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment161407> That isn't an OS X loading overlay. I'm guessing Adobe Reader/Acrobat (but don't have either installed so can't be sure). (Also it's not Safari Reader, that's the article reading feature; removed tag) <comment161410> @George Garside Thanks for removing the reader tag, you're right. I wasn't paying attention there. <comment161453> take a look in you /Library/InternetPlugins Folder maybe you have installed a third party PDF Application which has installed a pdf plugin for Safari (Adobe Acrobat and PDF Architect do this) - it may also be a pdf viewer integrated on the server side - can you podt us the jrl of the pdf file??? <comment161550> Ok, so far it's nothing in the Plugins folder. I'm just looking around for something Adobe Acrobat related now. This loader text comes up any time I download a PDF in Safari. <comment161559> Well, I went the nuclear routeâ€¦ I just deleted everything Adobe from the Safari Plug-ins. Back to good ol' Preview form my PDF's in Safari! I may revisit this in the future by trying to reinstall Reader plugins, but for now deleting everything will do.
