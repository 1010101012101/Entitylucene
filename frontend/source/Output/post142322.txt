How can I find Bottom Rubber Feet Foot For MacBook Pro 15" A1398？ <body> How can I find Bottom Rubber Feet Foot For MacBook Pro 15" A1398？ img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sq1im.png" alt="Model:A1398"  I searched Amazon.com and ebay.com, can not find this model.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fhnZA.jpg" alt="Bad, needs to be replaced."  <answer142705> As a former Mac Genius, I can tell you it's impossible to buy the feet separately as a replacement. You will have to get the bottom "plate" replaced. If it's under warranty, awesome, if not, it's less than $20 to get.  <answer142725> Apple actually has an article specifically about this, right here.  Apparently they have a rubber foot replacement kit which you can get if you contact them and request it.  Personally I would just find some soft-side velcro, felt, or some other craft material, cut out a few small circles with an xacto-knife, glue it on with Loctite (which is what Apple uses according to their article above) and call it a day.  If it really bugs you and you want someone else to cut out the little circles for you..  http://www.powerbookmedic.com/Macbook-Unibody-Feet-Replacement-Set-Black-p-23146.html  http://macdudu.en.alibaba.com/product/742059651-218052561/Rubber_Case_Foot_Feet_for_Macbook_Pro_retina_15_A1398.html  <answer178587> Look at this eBay link here:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/181701854491?ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1558.l2649  I hope it helps.  <comment271372> Has anyone ordered the feet from powerbookmedic for macpro model A1398?
