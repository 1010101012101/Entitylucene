Safari: How do I show history in a new tab in Safari? <body> I find this to be annoying. When I click on "History" - "Show History", Safari shows the history tab in my current tab and not in a new tab. So let say I was browsing Facebook and then decided to see my history, its opens in the tab that Facebook is opened on and not in a separate tab. Now I have to navigate back (click on Back) to get back to Facebook.  Is there any way I can configure that "Show History" is shown on a different tab in Safari when it opens?  <answer232118> As neither way to access history [from menu or from a toolbar button] allows you to open it in a new tab by the usual method of kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd clicking I'd suggest the best method might just be open it in a manual new tab - 2 keystrokes.   ul likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd T /kbd  for new Tab  /li likbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Y /kbd  for History/li /ul  Apparently, Show History kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Y /kbd may not be the same key command in all Languages, but I can only check for UK English...  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c9s5y.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment283535> I just wish they made safari more intuitive. <comment283537> "⌘Y" does not Show History in the version of Safari I'm using, it's "⌥⌘2". <comment283540> Might be different per Language. I added a pic. I'm on UK English.
