How to delete audio files' meta data? <body> I have some MP3s on my Mac. I want to import them into my iPhone. The problem is that, using iTunes, the iPhone automatically create several folders or albums, depending on the strongartist/strong, the strongalbum/strong, the stronggenre/strong (and so on) of one particular MP3 file.  Using Windows it's easy to prevent this, since I can delete manually all of these tags and file information, but using the Mac I seem to not be able to do this. Is there any way to delete this information?  <answer257716> Within iTunes, you can select the file and press command-I to get the file information. You can then delete all the meta-data associated with the mp3.  <comment321898> You don't have to copy the files into the Library and so it creates no new folders - is this what you want? <comment322010> It will only create artist / album folders, and maybe a compilation folder. I haven't seen genre folders "and so on"...
