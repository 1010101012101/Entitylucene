Java 7 on PowerPc <body> I have several powermac G4 computers running leopard, and would like to use them as a test environment for my Java 7 based applications. I have looked online a bit but could not find any way to install java 7 on a powerpc computer. I wouldn't mind using linux or other alternative operating systems if necessary to get java 7, but would prefer to stay on os x if possible,  <answer135034> Unfortunately, Java 7 is only available on OS X for Intel-based Macs running Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or later.  The Mac OS X System Requirements page for Java 7 states:     Mac OS X System Requirements      Intel-based Mac running Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or later.*   Administrator privileges for installation   64-bit browser   Note that installing Java on a Mac is performed on a system wide basis, for all users, and administrator privileges are required. You cannot install Java on a single-user basis.      A 64-bit browser (Safari or Firefox, for example) is required to run Java 7 on Mac OS X. 32-bit browsers such as Chrome do not support Java 7 on the Mac platform.      strongem*Users with Mac OS X versions 10.6 and below should go to Software Update under the Apple menu to look for updates./em/strong   There are some very old releases available for PowerPC at SoyLatte, but these may not be suitable.  <answer142132> PowerPC is still an official architecture for Debian. The package openjdk-7-jre is availible for powerpc and should run your Java 7 code.  <answer159816> I have successfully built and run Java 7 on my Mac OS X 10.5.8 PPC, exactly OpenJDK version em1.7.0-internal-landonf_2009_12_16_12_54-b00/em, using these instructions.  <comment187828> This is about Leopard, not Debian. <comment187833> @niutech - the question says "I wouldn't mind using linux" <comment187841> @Mark - then "but would prefer to stay on os x if possible". It is possible, I have added the answer. <comment201977> Thanks for sharing an OS X method. I'd be nice if someone would create an installer for Leopard. <comment202222> I have bundled my [JDK7 build](http://dfiles.eu/files/xgo71ltfy). I hope it will run on your Mac OS X PPC.
