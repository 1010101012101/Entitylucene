iPhone Storage Space Inaccuracy (No Storage Space) <body> I have an 8GB iPhone 4s and it always says I have no space. However when I go into codeSettings &gt; General &gt; Usage/code It says that I have code1.3GB/code of free space. I only have 5 photos and 3 Apps downloaded on my iPhone. Why does it constantly say I have no space when it should?  <answer197120> you can see what is eating up storage space: In your codeSettings/code app, go to codeGeneral &gt; Usage &gt; Manage Storage/code. Your phone will compute the space used by each application and their respective data.  Note: Hope I'm right with the menu names as my phone is in french...  ;)  <answer197148> Sometimes I have seen a lot of space taken up with the "other" category in the graph of space taken up on your iPhone in iTunes. Fixing that is not actually that difficult.  ol liBack up your iPhone to your computer (I would encrypt the backup as the backup will then save all your passwords too, which it does not do if you don't encrypt the backup.)/li liOnce done go into Settings  general  reset and erase all settings and data. (you may have to first turn off Find My iPhone, if its on, under iCloud)/li liWhen the phone reboots, plug it back into the computer, launch iTunes and restore the phone from the backup you just made./li /ol  Usually when you do this, if there is a lot of temporary or unneeded data on the phone this will do some house cleaning and free up some space. No guarantee this is your issue but it is easy enough to do and you won't lose anything except maybe an hour (or less) of your time.  <comment235581> Depending on the apps they can gobble space pretty bad. How much space are the apps using?
