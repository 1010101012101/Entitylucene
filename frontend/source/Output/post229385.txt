How do I enable 3 finger swipe down for App Expose in El Capitan <body> I have two machines side by side and cannot get the new one to mimic the app expose behavior.  ul li10.10.3 Yosemite - 3 finger down will show all windows in the current app/li li10.11.3 El Capitan - 3 finger down does nothing/li /ul  I want to keep the "Group windows by application" in Mission Control behavior.  I just want 3 fingers down to behave like Yosemite, any help would be awesome.  <answer229387> System Preferences - Trackpad - More Gestures - App Expose  And one thing changed since 10.10: From 10.11 it is  4 fingers instead of 3 fingers  It will never work with 3 fingers again, get used to it as a 4 finger gesture.  <comment279820> Ahh it's in gestures, awesome it works!
