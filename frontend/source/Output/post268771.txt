How could I disable the SMART monitor for my macbook <body> My model is macbook pro retina late 2013 15 inch, I am facing a problem that the last time I tried to reinstall my system and be alerted for the possible hard drive broken. I met this problem before while I kept using that hard drive for more than 1 year and nothing happened. In my opinion, sometimes SMART monitor is not accurate and reliable...(two of my friends got this warning and kept using the hard drive for more than 1 year) So I think that I could still have a try this time. While the problem is that no system installed in the hard drive and the SMART monitor stops the installation every time. I just wonder whether there are some commands which could disable this stupid monitor through the terminal.  <comment337519> I know that risk may exist if I keep using this hard drive, while I do not mind that, just want to ask some help to disable the smart check... Thank you.
