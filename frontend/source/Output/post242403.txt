Mac iTunes requests update, but App store says no updates available <body> Recently I got a iPhone 5 with iOS 9.3 installed.  On connecting it to my computer iTunes said that I needed at least iTunes 12.2.2.  I had 12.0 at the time.  Mac Running Yosemite.  I clicked download, and App Store launched, and said I had no updates available.  Went through this loop several times.  Called Apple.  Spent an hour on the phone, while the very personable agent walked me through the direct link (support.apple.com/kb/dl1814) Clicking the download button there got me to another page.  Clicking download there got me a "Thanks you for downloading..." but the download didn't begin.    I repeated this step with chrome, firefox and safari.  No joy.  Booted into safe mode.  Didn't help.   Went to two other computers, my wife's where I don't have a login, and my laptop, which runs snow leopard.r  No joy from either of those.  We left the ticket unresolved.  <answer242404> Since the apple advisor was able to perform the download at his end, but I was not able to at my end, my suspicion was that there was a problem with Apple's content distribution network.    This morning I tried again.  No joy.  On a hunch I tried logging in on a spare admin account.  No problem. connected to  the apple support site, and downloaded the update. Worked like a charm.  At this point it's not clear what happened, but with odd behaviour it does bring up one additional possibility to try:  Attempt the update as a different user.  <comment298160> If your answer solves your question, please [accept](http://apple.stackexchange.com/help/accepted-answer) the answer.
