Pros and cons - New MacBook with Pro Touch Bar <body> I want to buy the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, but I'm still hesitating. Could anyone give me the pros and cons of this new computer? Is it a good computer for a programmer?  In fact, I'll probably be dual-booting this computer with Ubuntu. Will the Touch Bar still be usable for this platform?  <answer262032> It is very subjective to say whether or not the computer is "good" for a programmer. At least it would be easier to say something meaningful if we knew what the programmer was programming. It is much easier to compare two specific computers according to a programming task you need accomplished.  However, on the overall side of things the pros for the 15" MacBook Pro are:  ul liCPU/GPU power (for a laptop)/li liDisplay/li liFast disk drive/li liModern connectivity (Thunderbolt 3 and USB 3.1 Gen 2)/li liBattery life/li liSize/weight/li /ul  Cons are:  ul li16 GB RAM limit/li liNo traditional connectivity (USB-A, HDMI, Ethernet, etc) without adapters/li liProbably not the best keyboard in the world/li liNot upgradable/li liPrice/li /ul  Regarding Ubuntu - there's no official (or unofficial) support for the touch bar (yet).  <comment328215> I know this computer is pretty thin. In fact, all part are welded together. Hence, we couldn't change any piece on the computer.  Why have they decided to do that? <comment328222> @SpinningAtInfinity I'm not sure if you've ever seen inside the innards of a laptop, but they're incredibly a lot more difficult to work with compared to most desktops. One reason is likely to be that welding reduces the risk of connectors etc working their way loose (especially since laptops are portable and transported around quite a bit). Another reason is to reduce the possibility of end users upgrading things themselves and therefore maximising Apple's ability to profit from them at point of sale. But these are speculative reasons on my behalf and only Apple could answer this question!
