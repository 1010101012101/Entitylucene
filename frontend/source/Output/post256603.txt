Keyboard layout is messed up, and I need to reset it from recovery <body> I am currently making a custom keyboard layout using Ukelele, for personal use. After swapping my current one (an older version of the custom version) with a new one and rebooting, the computer seems to be trying and failing to load a layout that doesn't exist.  As a result, my keyboard does not input anything when I type, making it impossible to log in to fix the changes.  I am currently in recovery mode, using the terminal to attempt a fix.  Before continuing, I have already tried resetting codeLibrary/Preferences/com.apple.HIToolbox.plist/code.  How would one do this?  (I need answers ASAP, this is my main machine and I have important work to do)  <comment320123> This is going to come off sounding more rude than I am intending it, but Ask Different is a free resource with volunteers answering questions.
