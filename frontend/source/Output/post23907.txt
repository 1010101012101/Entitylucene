Permissions error when exporting slideshow as a movie in iPhoto <body> I recently upgraded to Lion.   Now when I try to export an iPhoto slideshow as a QuickTime movie it goes through the initial rendering process but an error message appears with the iPhoto logo saying that I don't have permission for this task.   <answer23915> I've seen some people report issues with permissions and the desktop and/or other user folders. Try repair permissions with Disk Utility  <comment26751> Many thanks for that - I think I'm an Apple Dumbo  (just fairly recently moved from Windows).  Have just tried setting the save to a folder other than the "Shared Folder" it defaulted to, and hey presto, it worked.  Probably nothing to do with LION or iPhoto.
