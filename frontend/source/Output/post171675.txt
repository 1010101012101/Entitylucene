Two iPhones, buth synced but with different contacts <body> I have two iPhones and I would like to have them nicely synced calendar and task, but to keep different contacts. One is an office phone and I would like not to have my private numbers etc. Currently, on my old phone I have mail + contacts synced with Google, and Calendars, Reminders on iCloud, same as on my MacBook Air.  Can I sync some data but not all of it?  <answer171894> Only way I can think is to set up as 2 [or more] groups - so the contacts are there but not in your 'current' list.    That's how I logically separate my business from personal contacts.  Uncheck the groups you don't want to see on each phone  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/M0oOi.png" alt="enter image description here"         img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QEmBO.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer211467> Sign up for a free iCloud account to store your private contacts.   Calendars and tasks can be synchronized to both devices and only turn on contact syncing for the one device
