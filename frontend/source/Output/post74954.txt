iTunes 11 won't allow iPod content delete <body>    strongPossible Duplicate:/strongbr   Canâ€™t delete music from iTunes       My wife has a Windows laptop (I know) and since installing iTunes 11, she can't access the content on her iPod (click wheel) when it's connected. iTunes reads the iPod, but will not allow her to add or delete. How can she delete content from her iPod to make room for new?
