How is $PATH created? <body> I am still relatively new to the workings of the Mac OS but have extensive knowledge of Linux.  I updated my php on Mavericks using the php_osx and the instructions stated to use codeexport PATH=/usr/local/php5/bin:$PATH/code to have the new php version used.  Through my attempt to update php I found references to the following files:  ul licode.bash_profile/code - I can not find this file./li licode.bashrc/code/li lipaths/li lipath_helper/li /ul  Can someone please provide a simple understanding of how $PATH is created in Mavericks and help me understand where the export command put the edition to the path and how would I remove it if I want too?  <answer121021> On OS X you'll have following :    The base PATH used is located in code/etc/paths/code. It is used to set code$PATH/code.   By default, the file contains :   precode/usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin /code/pre  It will also load the paths located in code/etc/path.d//code.   When opening the terminal I will load :   ol licode~/.bash_profile/code /li licode~/.bash_login/code, (if .bash_profile doesn't exist)/li licode~/.profile/code (if .bash_login doesn't exist). /li /ol  These files can load some other files, for example code.bashrc/code.   If you want to expand your path you can do it in one of the files by adding your  codeexport/code command you gave in your question.  <comment141052> Do the answers to this question help? http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/12629/how-can-i-add-a-path-to-the-path-environment-variable <comment141061> Right! I updated that part. <comment141154> Matthieu thanks for the response.  However I have never created a .bash_profile or .bash_login or .profile and can not find them.  There is a /etc/bashrc file and the only file in the path.d directory is 40-XQuartz. The /etc/profile file seems to point to path_helper.  I can not seem to find where the export command I ran went to and how I would remove it if I wanted too.  Any help would be appreciated. <comment141156> `export` has only a effect on the current bash session. <comment141158> Ok. Getting closer to an understanding.  What does the export in my example do then that allows the php to always use the new version that is in a different directory then the preloaded version. <comment141166> If you want to have your path changed in every session, you have to put it in a file loaded with every new bash session. For example in one of the 3 files given above. If you haven't one, you can create it.
