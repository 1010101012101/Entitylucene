30" Cinema Dispay (1st gen) with AppleTV <body> Is it possible to connect 1st gen Apple Cinema Display to appleTV so that people could project their mac laptop screen on the 30'' Cinema monitor?  <comment182180> Only applications that support AirPlay would be visible though. <comment182181> Good point - common things like FF have this support? <comment182182> You will have to investigate that on your own.   If it supports AirPlay then you can broadcast it to the AppleTV.  This is normally limited to video in my personal experience. <comment182186> That's basically a duplicate of this question: http://superuser.com/questions/332099/does-a-hdmi-to-dvi-dual-link-adapter-exist-i-dont-care-about-the-price. The Cinema Display only has a Dual Link DVI input, and the Apple TV only does HDMI.
