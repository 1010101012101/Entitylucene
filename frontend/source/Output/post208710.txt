Recovery partition in the middle of the file system <body> I have a problem with my recovery partition. Before update to the el-capitan I had both osx and windows on the same ssd disc created with Boot Camp. The problem is that something went wrong during the upgrade to el-capitan, and I decided to remove the windows partition through Boot Camp. My disc has 250 GB, but for my system is available only 180GB, and I'm not able to find how I can extend the size of my partition. Below I'm attaching the screen from Disc Utility.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b69BO.png" alt="DIsc Utility"  Do you know how can I use my free disc space? Probably I have to move my Recovery partition to the end of my disc, but I'm not so sure about that.  And here is the print screen from codediskutil list/code command: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i7B9O.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer210650> To fix:  ul liBoot into the OS as normal./li liOpen a terminal and type: codediskutil list/code/li liRepair the disk: codediskutil repairVolume /dev/disk0s3/code (where disk0s3 is your recovery disk)/li liVerify the disk: codediskutil verifyVolume /dev/disk0s3/code/li liResize the partition: codesudo diskutil resizeVolume /dev/disk0s3 650M/code (and enter your Mac passcode)/li /ul  If successful, restart your Mac and after open disk utility and resize your core partition. Done.  <comment254494> nope, still not possible to change the main partition. The Strange thing is that I have 2 Recovery partition, I uploaded the print screen in the main question
