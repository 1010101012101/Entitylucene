Can I restore pre-Mavericks power key behavior? <body> Mavericks changed the behavior of my MacBook Air's power key to put the Air to sleep immediately when pressed briefly.  Prior to Mavericks, the power key would summon the Shut Down dialog.  As detailed in OS X Mavericks: Using the power button, holding the key for 1.5 seconds brings up the old Shut Down dialog, and holding for 5 seconds will shut down unconditionally.  Holding kbdcontrol/kbd while pressing the power key will also bring up the Shut Down dialog.  Is there any way to restore the old, pre-Mavericks behavior as a preference?  I'm used to using the power key to get the Shut Down dialog and seem to not be able to retrain myself particularly effectively.  <answer107781> The file to change would be code/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.PowerManagement.plist/code (cf this AD post)  In Lion/Mountain Lion we had a key codePower Button/code. Unfortunately it's not recognized anymore. I'm pessimistic about restoring this behaviour.   <answer115903> According to the following article, you can: http://binchewer.org/blog/index.php?id=1  <answer124942> Since Mac OS 10.9.2 you can go back to something close to the pre-Mavericks behavior easily.  Type in terminal:br codedefaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool no/code  It's not exactly the same, since you still need to press the button for 1 sec. But if you press the button accidentally, the shut down dialog is not going to appear.  Note: if you want to go back to the Mavericks behavior, juste change codeno/code to codeyes/code.  <comment126393> You're right; looks bleak. <comment129758> For what it is worth, ctrl+power brings up the Shut Down dialog immediately. <comment129761> Yup, mentioned that, and I'm slowly learning to do that.  Was hoping not to have toâ€¦  <comment129837> Derp, somehow missed that in your question. :-/ <comment135620> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment146232> Fantastically helpful!  Thank you! <comment150375> In OS X 10.9.2 the Power key can be restored to roughly pre-Mavericks behavior with `defaults write com.apple.loginwindow PowerButtonSleepsSystem -bool NO` <comment150441> We prefer to have the answer actually answer the question directly and not relying on external sites. Links may break (e.g. when the external site gets re-arranged or shutdown) rendering your answer useless. So if you could summarize the content of the linked site in your answer this would be really great. <comment318479> @patrix was right. Case in point: this link has gone dead, and isn't archived in the usual places either.    Then again, none of the answers are working for me in Sierra / macOS 10.12; nothing happens when I pressing the power button whether the setting mentioned is set to yes, no or unset <comment318482> @MatthewElvey Thanks for pointing out the broken link. As for the issue persisting with Sierra, there is already a question for this, unfortunately without an answer so far. <comment318483> @Pym Do you still have access to the information provided on the linked page and could add a summary here? <comment318488> Found a working answer to this, sort of, for Sierra, at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/28166/33389 : Keyboard shortcut is Option+Cmd+Eject (the Eject key is at your keyboard upper right corner). <comment320526> So yes, the link has gone dead... Next time I will do things right! The GitHub repository associated with this post is still available here: https://github.com/binchewer/power_fixer
