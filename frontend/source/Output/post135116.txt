In Need: Automated time-based iTunes downloads <body> I have a monthly bandwidth cap of 25gb download capacity, because I live in a rural area with no broadband at all.  I use the Exide satellite product. So, I'm extremely limited in my ability to download movies.  But... Exide give me unlimited bandwidth between midnight and 5am.  I'm in need of OSX automation that could automatically call iTunes to download a particular movie name or movie name list, from the iTunes store, starting at midnight.  Alternatively, I'd be happy to do this on iOS (iPad) and grab the movies that way.  Anyone who might be interested in building this for me, please get in touch.  I'm happy to pay you for your time and great support of my social life :-)  <comment160140> are you renting or buying
