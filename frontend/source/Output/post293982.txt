HomeKit: Can I get an alarm if a given device being monitored by a homekit device is not turned on witin a given period? <body> I have a medical device which needs to run while I sleep, and I need to be alarmed if for any reason it is not on during the night.  For practical reasons I need a period from activating until the actual monitoring starts.  I have just found a HomeKit compatible power monitoring device - Elgato Eve Energy  https://www.proshop.dk/Smart-Home/Elgato-Eve-Energy/2515842 - which may provide the monitoring part, but I need the logic to do the "first delay for an hour then sound an alarm if the monitored value goes below a given threshold".   I have plenty of apple devices but would prefer the controlling unit to be an iphone or an ipad.  Is this feasible or should I look at something else instead?
