Is there a way to access iCloud's Photo Stream from the Finder, similar to Windows? <body> On Windows, Photo Stream works in a way that all the files are automatically copied to your 'My Pictures' folder or the like.   I currently have Photo Stream working in Aperture, but every once in a while I think it would be nice to have direct access to Photo Stream in the Finder, so I could possibly script something (i.e., copy photos to Dropbox, add automatically Evernote, etc).   Is there a way that I can reach this, outside of iPhoto or Aperture on the Mac? And do one of these apps have to 'trigger' a sync from iCloud? Or is Photo Stream syncing automatically somewhere on the file system?  This could be a direct path, a smart folder, etc.   <answer45325> In short, strongno/strong.  Aperture's Photo Stream album is accessible in the Finder at ~/Pictures/Aperture Library.aplibrary/Database/Albums/, but good luck viewing it without using Aperture.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQteN.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer45417> After doing some research, I finally found where they were located, and then figured a quick way to get back to them.   The files themselves are stored in hashed folders under code~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/code.   I then created a Smart Folder using this path, and then selecting Kind as "Image". This then provides me with a directory with just the images in Photo Stream, outside of their folders.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEZ9T.png" alt="Smart Folder"  I also verified that this was working on a machine where iPhoto didn't have Photo Stream enabled itself, the only Photo Stream part was enabled in System Preferences. Therefore, it was syncing on its own, and not with a relation to iPhoto having to launch to trigger it.   You can't codecd/code into a smart folder, but it looks like I can use some actions with it it. I moreso wanted a direct folder, so I could copy stuff out quickly.  <answer52396> You can use my PhotoStream2Folder application to exploit this folder and store the images where you want on your drive.  <comment51641> This sounds similar to this [related question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/44417/218) about where PhotoStream saves its files. However, none of the answers there mentioned a specific folder. <comment51643> Its close, but I am looking for the direct folder. And the answers are all talking about the devices, im talking about the Mac OS <comment51736> if you want to use the command line, use mdfind instead: `mdfind -onlyin ~/Library/Application\ Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub/ jpeg` <comment59951> If you're affiliated with that application, please disclose that affiliation - thanks. <comment168191> Interestingly, iPhoto gives 664 photos in my stream, this shared folder has 567, and my iphone quotes 524.  Wat? <comment178149> Any way that you're aware of to extract images from a certain Shared Photo Stream? I'd like to find a way to pull out only photos from a certain photostream. <comment258089> This seems not to work anymore under El Capitan
