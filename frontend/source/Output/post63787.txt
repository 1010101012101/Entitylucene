Is it possible to get Safari of Mountain Lion running on Lion? <body> I noticed the difference in Safari 6.0 in Lion and Mountain Lion. In Lion it is Safari v 6.0 (7536.25) where as in Mountain Lion it is 8536.25.. The way safari works is also a bit different, for instance the tab view. I liked it when I used it, but I want the same in my Lion as well.. Can I copy the Safari.app from my office laptop running Mountain Lion and put it in my 13" MBP running Lion? Would this work?  <answer63790> Unfortunately, no - Safari uses quite a few system-level frameworks that are vastly different between those OSes.  <comment73795> Have you looked a webkit nightly builds? I don't have a Lion machine to test on but it might give you the features you are looking for:  http://nightly.webkit.org/ <comment73796> oh thanks for the reply.. So I probably have to upgrade to mountain lion then <comment73797> oh, I haven't come across this website thus far. Will take a look. Thanks for the link! <comment73798> Let us know if it works. If it does I'll re-submit as an answer. <comment73803> To standardize Safari 6, yeah, that would be easiest - imho, Mountain Lion is a real improvement over Lion.  (That tip about a nightly WebKit is a good idea too, I hadn't considered that.) <comment73860> Sadly it doesn't. It is still  Version 6.0 (7536.25, 537+) and not Version 6.0 (8536.25). <comment73861> No, I tried it. It doesn't have the features found in Mountain Lion :(
