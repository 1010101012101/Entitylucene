What steps can troubleshoot OS X when some sites do not resolve on Snow Leopard? <body> I cannot access www.lubuntu.net from my Macbook Pro running OS X 10.6.8. I have an idea as to what the problem is (see emmy opinion/em), but I did all the usual things anyway (see embasic troubleshooting/em), just to check.  emBasic Troubleshooting/em  I can access almost any other site from my macbook (for example this one). I can access lubuntu.net from my other laptop which is on the same wifi, meaning it's not a network, ISP, or router issue. Also the site is up, and this issue is persistent for several days.  I can successfully ping the site. The site resolves to an IP (thus not a DNS issue). The problem occurs using three different browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari. I never use Safari, so it's not an extension issue, either. I cannot access the site even if I paste its IP into the address bar.  My IP is likely not banned, since (1) there is no reason to ban me and (2) my other laptop is able to access the site over the same network, going through the same router.  Rebooting does not solve the issue.  emMy Opinion/em  I installed (and quickly uninstalled) a program called PeerGuardian, which blocks "suspicious" IPs. It is mainly used for blocking unwanted peers when downloading torrents. I think that it messed with one of the config files to block the Lubuntu site.  Which files should I check? I've taken a look at /etc/hosts, and that looks fine. Also /etc/resolv.conf looks normal. No idea where to go from here.  strongEDIT:/strong Here are the contents of system.log for my most recent attempt:     Oct 18 21:44:11 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Error reading receive buffer: read(): Connection reset by peer      Oct 18 21:45:20 albatross com.avast.proxy[50]: Defective HTTP request!

But I installed avast after the problem started, because I thought it might be a virus, so that doesn't make much sense...  strongEDIT 2:/strong added contents of /etc/hosts below  precode## # Host Database # # localhost is used to configure the loopback interface # when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.  127.0.0.1   localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1             localhost  fe80::1%lo0    localhost /code/pre  <answer69226> I was also recently trying to fix the same issue and it came down to PeerGuardian. I just altered the settings but didn't remove it, but found this article about a program called AppDelete that mentioned PeerGuardian and a number of its files that it would leave behind if you simply removed from the Applications folder:  http://dailyblogged.com/2506/appdelete-uninstall-anything-seriously/  Maybe this can help you track down any remaining files that are causing issues with your machine.  <answer69321> In agreement with the original poster, in this answer I put together the comments above that describe the troubleshooting steps that helped solve the issue.  ol liRealize that PeerGuardian uses a KEXT.  As emstrangelydim/em commented, PeerGuardian (an open source privacy oriented firewall software) uses a kernel extension (KEXT). The KEXT is used to block connections to "dangerous" servers specified in so-called blocklists./li liFind out whether the KEXT was the culprit.  The original poster booted his Mac into Safe Mode by pressing kbdShift/kbd during startup (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533).   Safe Mode does a lot of things (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564), among them strongit loads only required kernel extensions/strong, so PeerGuardian's KEXT wouldn't be loaded.   The original poster could successfully connect to www.lubuntu.net, so the KEXT was the offender./li liDisable the KEXT.  The first try was to move the KEXT from code/Library/Application Support/PeerGuardian/code to code/tmp/code and reboot. That didn't help. The original poster then deleted the KEXT. I also asked him to check in codeSystem Preferences&gt;Users &amp; Groups&gt;Login Items/code whether PeerGuardian was listed and remove it.   After a reboot he could sucessfully connect to www.lubuntu.net./li /ol  So the bottom line is that, unfortunately, some programs cannot be uninstalled by simply dragging them to the Trash.  <comment80007> Have you checked the various log files such as system.log?  The easiest way to check them is to run Console.app <comment80013> Copied contents into question. albatross is the hostname <comment80014> Can you also post the contents of `/etc/hosts`? I doubt its the issue since DNS resolves, but just curious. <comment80179> I've posted /etc/hosts above. Everything seems typical, but not sure about last line. <comment80185> PeerGuardian uses a kernel extension (.kext) to do its filtering, so if it's at fault, you wouldn't see anything different in /etc/hosts.  Yours looks fine. <comment80186> Instead, see if you have an app called "pgstart" in "/Library/Application Support/PeerGuardian/".  If you do, try doing a "sudo ./pgstart -u" from that directory.  Then try heading to a "banned" site.  Also see if you have a /Library/Extensions/PeerGuardian.kext , and if so, move it to a temporary folder somewhere else and restart; if none of that works, try _installing_ PeerGuardian again using all default options and then running the uninstaller again. <comment80205> Boot into Safe Mode by pressing Shift during startup (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1533). Safe Mode does a lot of things (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1564), among them it **loads only required kernel extensions**, so PeerGuardian's kext, if still installed on our system, won't be loaded. Then test if you can connect to www.lubuntu.net. <comment80248> You're right that it's not a DNS issue if you can ping the site by its domain. Do you have an HTTP proxy set up (System Prefs  Network  Advanced)? What happens when you run `curl lubuntu.net` in terminal? <comment80353> @jmk curl: (7) Failed to connect to 140.211.166.147: Connection refused <comment80354> @jaume I can get onto Lubuntu in safe mode. So then it's PeerGuardian's fault, probably? And how do I fix it? <comment80355> @strangelydim pgstart is not present. PeerGurdian.kext was not in /Library/Extensions, but was in /Library/Application Support/PeerGuardian/. I renamed it and moved it to /tmp, but it didn't help. I will try your method of re-installing and uninstalling. <comment80403> And if instead of moving PeerGuardian.kext to /tmp you delete it (either with rm or moving the kext to the Trash and emptying it)?. If it worked in safe mode it's probably the kext, so let's get rid of it. Check also in System PreferencesUsers & GroupsLogin Items whether PeerGuardian is listed and remove it. Reboot and try to connect to lubuntu. <comment80516> @jaume Everything is good after the reboot and removing the kext file. If you formulate that into an answer, you get the bounty. :)
