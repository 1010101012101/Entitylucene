Opening Mobile Documents folder in Finder on Sierra <body> As of Sierra(?) opening code~/Library/Mobile Documents/code in the Finder actually takes you to code~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/code. This the Finder stylizes as "iCloud Drive" and only has folders for certain applications.  It is still possible to access Mobile Documents proper through Terminal, but even when opening the directory in Finder directly from Terminal it redirects to com~apple~CloudDocs.  Is it possible to access the root Mobile Documents folder from Finder?  <answer269782> No - you'll need an alternative GUI program to see that folder.   Finder is hard coded to not show you that folder no matter how you try to navigate there.  <comment338942> Probably an XY question - what do you really want to do once you get finder to show you the root of mobile documents? <comment338943> @bmike I want to manage all of my iCloud data in a UI that I'm familiar with. I *can* do everything I need to with Terminal, but I'd much rather use a GUI. Sounds like Path Finder or something may be my only option then. <comment338944> Cool - just wondering if there was another way to get you a solution. Maybe someone will post a hack to Finder to short circuit the change or otherwise mess with cloud sync. I would hate to suggest anything that would cascade delete your iCloud data since you don't get an easy way to back that up at present. <comment338945> Have you tried disabling the iCloud drive in system preferences and then trying to access that folder in finder? <comment354207> Perhaps you could use something like [nnn](https://github.com/jarun/nnn) to make management in Terminal easier?
