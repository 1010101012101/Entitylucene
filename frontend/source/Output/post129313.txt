Where are Photo Stream pictures stored on my Mac? <body> I am trying to locate the pictures from my photo stream to back up on my computer and I cant find them. Any help is greatly appreciated  <answer129314> Photo Stream pictures are stored in  precode~/Library/Application Support/iLifeAssetManagement/assets/sub /code/pre  locally.  <comment151345> It's worth noting that they are only stored there *after* you have configured iPhoto to pull them down from the cloud, and it has subsequently done so.  They won;t just appear unless you occasionally open iPhoto to perform those syncing actions subsequently. <comment151369> @stuffe: that's not correct. There's a background process called `iCloud Photos` that always runs and pulls down your Photo Stream photos even when iPhoto isn't open (I just tested it to confirm). See here: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120707/does-iphoto-need-to-be-open-in-order-to-download-photo-stream-photos <comment151371> Interesting, and thanks! Mine doesn't appear to be working then... <comment224438> Also, if you are on a new Mac with Photos, the Photo Stream photos are now in ~/Library/Containers and only the subscribed photos and using iCloud sharing are in iLifeAssetManagement under A S in Library.
