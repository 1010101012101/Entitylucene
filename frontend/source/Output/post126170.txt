Is there a way to change order of physical disks in Corestorage <body> I upgraded existing system to a "Fusion drive" - corestorage volume - consisting of existing 300GB HDD and new 120GB SSD.  Instead of creating a new corestorage drive I went with the route of converting the system drive to corestorage, adding new SSD as a corestorage volume, and then resizing logical volume to the new size. Order of commands is like that:  precodebash-3.2# diskutil cs convert disk1s2 #disk1s2 - existing HDD with OSX Started CoreStorage operation on disk1s2 Macintosh HD Resizing disk to fit Core Storage headers Creating Core Storage Logical Volume Group Attempting to unmount disk1s2 Switching disk1s2 to Core Storage Couldn't unmount disk1s2; converted volume won't appear until it's unmounted Core Storage LVG UUID: 0BE79B93-86D9-41DE-9071-D9DD933037CD Core Storage PV UUID: AD5882F6-6210-41CA-8F9E-76F6E3CA44E9 Core Storage LV UUID: ADFEA6C1-18D8-4705-8006-9641BC2B7C6F Finished CoreStorage operation on disk1s2 Macintosh HD  --reboot--  bash-3.2# diskutil cs adddisk 0BE79B93-86D9-41DE-9071-D9DD933037CD disk0 #1st param - CS LVG, disk0 - SSD ID Started CoreStorage operation on disk0 Unmounting disk0 Repartitioning disk0 Unmounting disk Creating the partition map Rediscovering disk0 Adding disk0s2 to Logical Volume Group Switching disk0s2 to Core Storage Waiting for Logical Volume Group to come back online Core Storage PV UUID: E2664618-2492-4B13-905D-57D92F385D43 Finished CoreStorage operation on disk0  bash-3.2# diskutil cs resizevolume ADFEA6C1-18D8-4705-8006-9641BC2B7C6F 380220544k The Core Storage Logical Volume UUID is ADFEA6C1-18D8-4705-8006-9641BC2B7C6F Started CoreStorage operation Checking file system ...

But... I've been using it extensively for several days now, and strangely enough SSD is never used for reads... there are only a few writes to SSD every now and then, but still all the major processing is done via HDD.  I expected it to be so for the first time while the SSD is being filled with new/frequently used data, but even when I write new files they tend to go to HDD rather than SDD. To test that I created 100MB files, and while the HDD was not full all writes were going to HDD.  So my questions are:  ol liDoes it matter in which order physical volumes are listed in Corestorage logical volume group setup? How Corestorage chooses which drive is the best for immediate writes? Since it frees up some space on SSD when working on a genuine FusionDrive, it should know that it is "better" to do immediate writes on SSD rather than HDD./li liIs there a way to "change priority" of physical drives within logical volume group? I assumed CoreStorage would "know" that SSD is a faster drive.../li /ol  Thanks  <answer129528> Q1:  Yes, it seems that the order of disks is important.  According to the post of codeJiri Hracek/code here: http://blog.macsales.com/17624-os-x-10-8-3-provides-fusion-drive-setup-option-for-non-fusion-drive-equipped-macs  if you put the SSD at the second place, codeFusion Drive is not working at all.../code  Thus, one possible way that Fusion Drive works it that is takes the first drive as the faster one, frees up spaces in the first one, and put the files in the second...  Q2:  it seems that there is not... So your only choice seems to be recreating the Fusion Drive from scratch. Besides, I looked at my own SSD-HDD Fusion Drive, its order is SDD @ first as well...  <answer261274> I'm two years late and who-knows-how-many dollars short at this point, but I just ran into this problem as well, and the solution above worked for me. I've documented all my steps in this gist  My backstory: when trying to wipe an iMac whose drive had been partitioned with Boot Camp, the new Disk Utility GUI beachballed and upon restart, the fusion drive had separated. I followed advice from SO to re-fuse the drive, but inadvertently put the HDD in front of the SSD.  strongtl;dr/strong these steps worked:  ol liRun codediskutil list/code and grab the name of the physical SSD &amp; HDD (codedisk3/code and codedisk4/code in my case)/li liRun codediskutil cs create "imac-fusion" disk3 disk4/code, with the name of the SSD in front of the HDD (this must be where I messed up last time)/li liRun codediskutil cs list/code and note the ugly GUID string of the newly created "Logical Volume Group", which in my case was codeDD1F3A9F-7171-4FDF-9994-9453A4C95109/code/li liRun codediskutil cs createVolume "DD1F3A9F-7171-4FDF-9994-9453A4C95109" jhfs+ "Macintosh HD" 100%/code/li /ol  I just restored with Super Duper! and it works!
