What is the difference between a reset and delete <body> I have a problem with my iPod nano which plays a track initially and later skips to the next track. I tried the same track in itunes v12 and it plays with ease. I had asked for this here for which I got an answer as to try doing the reset+delete all.  But my doubt is that if I am doing the reset (which I have done) then am I not in-directly deleting all the songs+the voice over   If I am wrong with the above then could please tell me what exactly is the difference in the reset and the delete  <answer186778> When you reset you basically restarting the hardware and the device reloads the software.   When you delete you remove all the data from the device.  Though to solve your problem I would suggest you try the following:  Use iTunes to Restore your iPod to factory default. Once complete reload your content.  when you restore you erase the device completely and it reinstalls a new copy of the software to the device.  Regards  Kyle
