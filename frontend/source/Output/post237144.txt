How to create a Mac OS X Yosemite dmg bootable Installer Version? <body> I have a Mac OS X Yosemite downloaded file like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8JLv.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LGqUl.png" alt="enter image description here" img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ogyIp.png" alt="enter image description here"  Like I see, it must have a Yosemite.app file in it, so why doesn't this have the file? This is truly from an Official Apple Website. It just has a .pkg file. Can anybody explain this to me? And, How to create a complete bootable Yosemite 10.10.5 DMG disk image for clean OS install?  <answer237145> It's inside the .pkg file (notice how large it is?). You'll need to unpack it using something like AnyToISO.  <comment290328> Is this an update? If so, you should know that you can not install any OS X version from an update. Also, as far as I know, you can not currently get Yosemite from the Apple store. <comment290329> it is from http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/48498/os-x-yosemite. <comment290330> i Am the one ask really nice. but never get the right answer. <comment290333> The file you downloaded is to small to be any complete version of Yosemite. Your file size is comparable to the file you can download from [OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 Update](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1833?locale=en_US). This file is named `osxupd10.10.5.dmg` and is 995 MB in size. It is an update from OS X 10.10.4 to OS X 10.10.5. <comment290336> Can you not go to the Apple Store and get El Capitan OS X 10.11? <comment290358> @sukihinata What you just did wasn't very nice. He gave you a correct answer. The .app file is inside the .pkg file. Just extract it.
