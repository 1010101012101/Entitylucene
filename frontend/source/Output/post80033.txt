How to fix OD diradmin account? <body> I am unable to add new accounts nor delete existing accounts in Open Directory despite being authenticated as diradmin.  I can change existing user passwords though.  Tried rebooting, no change.  I was able to create and delete accounts earlier today.  The options to create/delete accounts are disabled in the OSX Server Mountain Lion GUI.  Suggestions are appreciated.  <answer88395> Hope this isn't too late, or that at least it is useful for others.  I tried http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1194 several times to no avail. I was simply unable to authenticate with the diradmin account.  An Apple support person recommended:  ol liArchive the OD from the Server.app → OD panel → action menu → Archive Open Directory Master… /li liSelect the server in the list and click on the minus button Once the OD has been destroyed, You will see the OD is now Off. /li liCreate the OD by switching back to ON and create the OD again with the same information as before (including the DirAdmin) /li liCreate a BackupDirAdmin account with WGM to have a backdoor, just in case /li liIn terminal restore the archive you saved in step 1 using      sudo slapconfig -restoredb &lt; archive-path  /li   liRetest the authentication after the directory has been restored./li   /ol   Try as I might I couldn't get this to work, and then I noticed that in Mountain Lion server the slapconfig command had lost the -merge option so restoring the database was dumping both the new DirAdmin and backdoor account....   Bizarrely, after a lot of digging around I saw that mkpassdb has a -setadmin flag, so I tried to use this to elevate another slotId to admin rights. This worked, and then I was able to reset the password for the DirAdmin account.  <answer207579> This worked for me at 10.10 Yosemite:  precodesudo ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://127.0.0.1 -s base namingContexts /code/pre  dn: namingContexts: dc=XXX-Produktion,dc=local  Put your dc= ,dc=  into this:  precodesudo ldappasswd -x -H ldapi://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fldapi -S uid=diradmin,cn=users,dc=XXX-Produktion,dc=local /code/pre  <answer225194> Keep in mind that if you have enabled password policy, it applies when resetting the password, you can't re use the previous password and the change will fail.  <comment202499> Just make sure to quit Server.app and Directory Utility before step 5 in order to make it work… Hoping it's the last time I get that kind of issue while updating one of many OD…
