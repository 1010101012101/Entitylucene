How do I get Time Machine to Show in Notification Center? <body> Notifications has many of my favorite Apps in it, however, Time Machine is conspicuously  absent.  I read here that it should be showing:     System notifications System alerts with updates about your battery,   Time Machine backups, and ejected disks appear as notifications, so   you can easily spot them with the rest of your notifications.   How do I add Time Machine to the list?  <answer125061> You don't need to add Time Machine to the list. Along with all other OS X system notifications, they are shown in Notification Center without any user intervention required to activate them. Conversely, you can't disable them either. This is the same with battery notifications, disk ejection notifications, etc.  If you want to disable Time Machine notifications, set the flags value for code_SYSTEM_CENTER_:com.apple.TMHelperAgent/code in the codeapp_info/code table in ~/Library/Application Support/NotificationCenter/&lt;udid.db to code12609/code or code13639/code.  If you want to customise it further, change one of the other entries for Notification Center, then read the flags value for that app and save it as the flags value for TMHelperAgent.  <answer174996> To disable Time Machine notifications on strongYosemite/strong, first find the Notification Center database by running:  precodecd `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR`/com.apple.notificationcenter/db /code/pre  You'll end up in a directory containing a SQLite database called codedb/code. In this database's codeapp_info/code table, set the codeflags/code value for code_SYSTEM_CENTER_:com.apple.TMHelperAgent/code to code12609/code.  <comment146362> Do you mean that Time Machine doesn't show up in the list of apps under `System Preferences  Notifications`, or that no notifications from Time Machine ever appear? (In my experience, Time Machine only notifies me when a backup hasn't happened for many days...) <comment146369> Correct, it does not show up in the list of apps under System Preferences  Notifications. I have seen notifications on another computer, running Mavericks, that pops up a notice when a backup is successfully completed. <comment146370> Hi GR, please see my note above. Is there any way to modify what notices you get for Time Machine? <comment146371> @fmz Not really, but see my edit <comment146373> Excellent. Thanks for the tips. <comment180997> I see 535 value for flags in Yosemite. What value should I set? <comment181000> @AlKozin Set the value depending on what type of notifications you want. I haven't tried this on Yosemite but the procedure should be the sameâ€”set the notification settings for any other app, then copy the flags value for that app to Time Machine. <comment181003> @grgarside Thanks! Don't think about solution from that angle.
