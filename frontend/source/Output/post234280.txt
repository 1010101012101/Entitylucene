Notification from FaceTime won't disappear! <body> I have a notification on my MacBook that won't disappear.  My FaceTime app has a notification that wont disappear without me going into settings and clicking the badge icon. I want to delete the notification, not disable the badge icon, yet nothing works.  I've tried deleting all the recent and missed calls on my app and restarting it. It's not found in the Notification Center on the right (which opens when you click the 3 bars icon in the top right corner of the Menu Bar).  What do I do?   <answer235375> This usually em(not always)/em happens when there is still a missed call somewhere.  See if this helps:  ol liGo to codeFacetime --&gt; Preferences/code/li liUncheck the box codeCalls from this phone/code/li liEnsure that only the correct phone number is listed there (and not some other family member)/li liClose codePreferences/code and delete any codeAudio/code or codeVideo/code calls listed on the left side/li /ol  Sometimes there's missed codeAudio/code calls and that causes the badge to appear.  <answer284618> I've found say of clearing the badge by updating the database backing FaceTime on the Mac. This detailed blog post I wrote  detailing the steps.  In essence, there is an SQLite db in code~/Library/Application Support/CallHistoryDB/code, with a table called codeZCALLRECORD/code which holds the read state, from which the badge is generated. The column name is codeZREAD/code. Updating the value in this column to code1/code, followed by a logout and login, should clear the badge.   <comment305640> Worked for me, thanks. <comment361903> This assumes that you want to otherwise keep the call history or data which exists for Facetime. If you do not, you can delete the directory (or better yet, rename it, in case you need to restore it).
