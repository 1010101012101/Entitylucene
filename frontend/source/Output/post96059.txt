Setting up environment variables for GUI apps? <body> Transitioning from Windows to the Mac. In Windows, I had ema lot/em of environmental variables set-up that I used to speed up my work. Thinks like   precodeDEVDIR=C:\WORKDOCS\DOCS_jaravj\PROJ\dev DOCDIR=C:\WORKDOCS\DOCS_jaravj PERS=C:\WORKDOCS\DOCS_jaravj\Personal PROD=C:\WORKDOCS\DOCS_jaravj\PROJ\PROD SVN=C:\WORKDOCS\DOCS_jaravj\PROJ\SVN_CO_Tort /code/pre  etc...  That, and the "magic" of autocompletion in the "Run" box and in the file save/open dialogs, allowed me to move around very quickly.  I've set up the equivalent env. variables in the shell, and I can cd and mv etc to the proper directories, but I haven't found a way to do something similar for the GUI apps, so that I can use the same shortcuts in the applications...  I've followed the tips in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x to add the env vars to /etc/launchd.conf but when I am going to save a file (for example), I can't use $PROJ in the "directory selector" and have the file be saved there...  <answer96060> I don't believe variables set in the environment are going to work in the Open &amp; Save dialog box (OSDB). It's a nice idea, but you'd have to admit, kinda neckbeardy.   The emMacintosh way/em would be to use the Favorites list presented on the left of the OSDB. Drag your often used directories there and you have one-click access.   A much more powerful alternative is Default Folder X. This gives you an incredible degree of short-cutting and changes of default behaviors in the OSDB.  <answer153399> If you really want to use the mentioned environment variables in Save dialogs, you could set up expansion short cuts with a tool like TextExpander or Keyboard Maestro which can expand environment variables to typed text and then use the "Go to Folder" feature (short cut codeApple-G/code) (which is available in Save dialogs) to type the locations from the expanded environment variables.  emNote: Be aware that in the current Mac OSX Yosemite, the codelaunchd.conf/code system not works anymore, but there are other ways to achieve the same thing./em  <comment112769> How would you use a GUI app to call an environment variable? Can you edit in a specific instance how this might work? <comment112771> @bmike this is standard OS interaction call the function  getenv() passing the name and it returns the value <comment112774> @Mark so this really isn't a user level question since you need to be developing an app to make the call? I'm assuming GUI means cocoaâ€¦. <comment112890> If you test it in Windows, you'll see that you can type in env. vars in any "explorer" dialog, and it'll auto-expand and auto-complete. It's kind of nerdy, but allows you to do all kinds of file management from the command line. Thanks for the tip about DefaultFolder X; other things I miss from OSX are being able to do "file actions" (like open a new folder, delete o rename files) from within the open/save/file dialogues. <comment112891> I'll try and take a few screenshots to show what I mean but at the moment I'm a all tied up, so it might take a bit. Basically, to "see" what I mean, define a couple of user env. variables in Windows and then type them in the location bar in Explorer, or in a "save" dialog box - you can do things such as %DOCDIR% TAB and it'll auto-complete and suggest alternates from there... Extremely powerful, mouseless way of navigating the system
