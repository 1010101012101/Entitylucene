Mounting Encrypted Filesystem From VM <body> I am running VirtualBox on a Sierra host using an Ubuntu 16.04.2 guest.  I have a an encrypted code/home/code directory on the Ubuntu VM and my code$HOME/code directory is encrypted as well.  I want to mount my code$HOME/code or a sub-directory of it so I can edit source code with a graphical editor.    I have setup my code/etc/exports/code like this:  precode/home/.ecryptfs/stephen *(rw,no_root_squash,subtree_check) /code/pre  When I try to mount it, I get the following:  precode$ sudo mount -v 192.168.0.27:/home/.ecryptfs/stephen/.Private ~/Code/encode mount_nfs: can't mount /home/.ecryptfs/stephen/.Private from 192.168.0.27 onto /Users/Stephen/Code/encode: Operation not permitted /code/pre  "Operation not permitted" is a pretty vague error message so I don't know exactly the problem is.  I tried using code-v/code as well but it give the same results.  Can I do what I want to do?  I have MacPorts installed and have installed the codeencfs/code port but, since I can't mount the directory, I haven't got to a point where it's useful yet.
