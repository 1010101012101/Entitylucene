Can I get old Super Drive to work with new MacBook Pro Retina Display? <body> I have a working SuperDrive (Super 898A) which I pulled out from my old, non working, late 2010 15" MacBook Pro. Can I somehow get an adapter and get it to work with my new retina display MacBook Pro? Is there any possibility to get an adapter and maybe some firmware installed to make them work together? I really want to save the 70 Dollars it cost to buy an external one (BTW if there's a way, will it be cheaper than just going to buy a new one?), because I figured out that if I have something that works, why dumping it?  <comment166025> Googling 'superdrive enclosure': [OWC SuperSlim for Apple SuperDrive USB 2.0 Optical Drive External Enclosure](http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other+World+Computing/VLSS9TOPTU2/)
