Still receiving online messages/notifications after disabling cellular data <body> When disabling 3G/network usage (go to Settings-Cellular-Use cellular data for:) for a specific application (eg. Facebook, Hangouts, Messenger, ...) I can still receive messages and/or notifications on my iPhone.  Is this some kind of bug in iOS [version: 7.1(11D167) - modemfirmware: 2.18.02]?  <comment147995> I guess you're not connected to a Wifi or so, right? <comment147997> No I'm sure I'm only connected to 3G <comment147999> After changing the setting restart the phone so the network provider gets it. <comment148026> Are you serious @Buscarì›ƒ ? <comment157470> If you turn off cellular data only for Facebook messenger will still send you notifications and vice versa. I can't imagine an other possible scenario.
