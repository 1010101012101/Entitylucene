Any way to make nicknames appear rather than full names? <body> When creating contacts, you can enter nicknames. Is there a way to make these nicknames appear when your contacts call/text you as opposed to their full names?  Thanks.  <answer52653> Unfortunately, Apple hasn't given us that feature. As you probably already noticed the only place it displays is in the contact listing itself.  <answer79154> Jailbroken people can opt to install Nickname from Cydia.  <answer140610> Enter their nickname in the company space. Then list them as a company. It will bold the name in your contacts list. From then on they will show up as their nickname.   <comment60229> Ah right, no worries - at least I know for sure now. :-) <comment60230> Maybe they will add that iOS 6? (I kind of doubt it though).
