2014 MacBook Air does not run Sierra properly <body> So I am currently running OS X Mavericks and have previously tried to upgrade to sierra, but it is not successful.   I have contacted Apple and they installed it successfully for me but after several weeks the computer crashes and does not restart. This happened several times so Apple managed to get me Mavericks.   However, now the current version of the software that I need to run is no longer supported by Mavericks and I need an updated OS perhaps El Capitan or Yosemite which is no longer available. Does anyone have a fix for this or have had this problem with Sierra?  <comment371786> The wise man downloads every new OS as it becomes available, even if he never installs it. That leaves it in your Purchase History for any time in future. <comment371787> Another wise move is to keep historical versions of important software so one can go back to a previous version if necessary. Which may be a solution for this case. <comment371789> I would really like some help with the problem at hand not suggestions as to how i could have prevented a problem that i didn't know would have. in hindsight I would have done these things but it's a bit late now. <comment371790> @DanielAustin Get in touch with a friend/colleague with one of the required OSs in his/her purchase history and ask him/her to download it for you. You can then either transfer the installer app to your Mac or create an installer thumb drive on the friend's/colleague's Mac. <comment371794> A pertinent question may be "Why does Sierra not run properly?" At the moment, this is heading towards [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info) territory.
