Can I use Xcode to run previously purchased apps? <body> So I bought an app from the app store and I'd like to run it in Xcode. I know you can hook up your Apple ID to Xcode but I wasn't sure if you can then download previously purchased apps and run them. Anyone know?  <answer148424> You can't run bought apps in the iOS simulator in Xcode.  <comment174830> What exactly do you mean by running them in Xcode? Debugging them? Using Instruments?
