Set tag color of image in Preview with hotkey/keyboard shortcut <body> I'd like to be able to add a tag color to an image I'm viewing in Preview with a hotkey / keyboard shortcut.  I found something for Finder: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6511743?start=0&amp;tstart=0 but I can't replicate it with Preview.  My use case is that I'd like to open ~1000 images in Preview when I come back from a photoshoot, view each one fullscreen, and have the option to easily tag each image with a color while I view it. So, I'm scrolling through, I see an image I want to mark, CMD+R (or whatever), and its given a red tag, which I can easily find later in Finder. It seems like a pretty simple request, but I haven't found anyway to do this.
