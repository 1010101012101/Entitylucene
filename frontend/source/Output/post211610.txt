Outlook for Mac - archive single email with a keyboard shortcut <body> In Thunderbird I can press the "A" key and archive the highlighted email to a folder named after the current year. In Outlook I've seen various ways to move to a folder via a keyboard shortcut and then select the folder to move to (a two step process); I could not find a way to move an email to a particular folder with a single keyboard shortcut.  Is there a way a to move an email to a designated folder with a single keyboard shortcut in Outlook 2016 for Mac?  emNote/em: I had previously asked this question at personal productivity but my question was deemed "too specific".  <answer213006> Here you can find the way, through shortcuts: http://www.officeformachelp.com/2013/08/unleash-new-uses-for-keyboard-commands-in-outlook-for-mac/   <answer213044> h3Can be done via codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code under codeSystem Preferences/code/h3  Manually move the email once to the folder that you want, say codeArchives/code by right-clicking the email and choose it or using codeShift Cmd M/code. After that codeArchives/code will start showing as one of the options when you try to another move email.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3wsN8.png" alt="Make Archives folder available for shortcut"  Once youâ€™ve moved the message the folder becomes a recent item under the Move menu button in Outlook and a keyboard shortcut can now be assigned to it.   Open codeKeyboard Shortcuts/code under codeSystem Preferences/code and assign your favourite keyboard shortcut e.g. codeControl-Option-A/code to move messages to this folder (codeArchives/code).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YwUZB.png" alt="Assign shortcut in System Preferences"  <answer270760> This works for me in v15.30.   Trick is replace "Archives" with the exact folder name.  "Archives" is not a command name but the name of the folder you want the shortcut to move the mail to.    <answer294592> This isn't exactly the question you asked, but Ctrl-e is the keyboard shortcut for archiving a message (at least as of Outlook for Mac version 15.36).  <comment257211> While this link may answer the question, it is better to include the essential parts of the answer here and provide the link for reference.

Are you able to test it on this version? <comment258546> Yes, works for me in outlook 2016. You need to move the one email to your desired folder once by right-clicking it and then `Move`. <comment281890> Sorry for my really tardy acceptance of this answer - I could not get the above steps working when I last tried but will try again. On other note the latest version of Outlook for Mac now has *one click* archiving which is not as good as a single keypress but definitely an improvement!
