Any way to launch a separate instance of Google Chrome with a custom icon? <body> I'm using this command  precode'/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome' --user-data-dir=/foo/bar /code/pre  to launch a separate instance of Chrome which I use solely for chat (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.) which is very handy, but when I Command-Tab to switch between it and my primary Chrome instance they both have the same icon.  Is there any way to use a custom icon for this instance?  (I know about apps like Franz and Rambox but they don't allow the use of certain text Services which I need.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uiWZ3.png" width="277"  <answer278014> You emcould/em do all this via the Finder instead, along the following lines:  ol liWithin Finder, navigate to your Google Chrome app /li liSelect (but do not launch) the Google Chrome app /li liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbdC/kbd to emcopy/em the app/li liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbdV/kbd to empaste/em the app/li liNow you will have two copies of the Google Chrome browser/li liSelect the second copy (but do not launch it)/li liPress kbdcommand/kbdkbdI/kbd to emget info/em of the app/li liNow navigate to wherever you have the icon you'd like to use and also Get Info (kbdcommand/kbdkbdI/kbd) for that/li liIn the Get Info window for the icon, select the icon at the top left and press kbdcommand/kbdkbdC/kbd to emcopy/em the icon/li liNavigate back to the Get Info window for the second copy of Google Chrome (the one you opened up at Step 7)/li liSelect the Google Chrome icon and paste (kbdcommand/kbdkbdV/kbd) the icon you copied at Step 9/li liWhile you're at it, you emmay/em want to rename the second copy of Google Chrome/li /ol  Now when you launch the two copies of Google Chrome, they will each have a separate icon.  <comment349879> Wouldn't this break Google Chrome updates? I'd expect that one of the apps (probably the copy) wouldn't be updated in the future... <comment349881> Related or possible duplicate: [Is there a simple way to have separate dock icons for different Chrome Profiles?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66670/is-there-a-simple-way-to-have-separate-dock-icons-for-different-chrome-profiles?rq=1) <comment349882> @klanomath Granted, that _could_ be a possible unintended consequence with Google Chrome. I haven't done this with Google Chrome, only other apps that I update manually (and not for a long time at that).  Ze'ev, if you go ahead with this approach, it'd be good if you reported back after the next Google Chrome update.
