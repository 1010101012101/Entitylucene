What does the blue point before app name in lauchpad mean? <body> img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aSRyY.png" alt="enter image description here"  As the arrows point, the little blue points before Evernote and MS OneNote.  <answer174543> The recommendation system of stackexchange really helps, I got this when I asked the question.  It turns out the little blue point shows I haven't opened the app since the app's last update.  <comment205520> Same on iDevices too.
