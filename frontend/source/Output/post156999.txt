iPhone 6 keyboard freezing when typing on iOS 8 (com.apple.TextInput.kbd) <body> I had an iPhone 5 before upgrading and its keyboard never froze on iOS 8, but with my iPhone 6 it is happening all the time. I already redefined my keyboard dictionary.  Bringing up console I see a error on TextInput:  precodeNov 18 11:19:27 GBFGabriel-iPhone-6 com.apple.xpc.launchd[1] (com.apple.TextInput.kbd) &lt;Notice&gt;: Service only ran for 1 seconds. Pushing respawn out by 3 seconds. /code/pre  Anyone has any idea why is this happening/how to fix this?  <answer157237> With a little more digging I found that the problem was with the kbd process using tons of memory when I tried to write something. Google search with "kbd process" bring me a lot of useful links:  iOS &amp; iCloud: Broken iCloud data causes kbd process to crash constantly and drains battery  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5521035  http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1615584  What did worked for me was turning iCloud drive off and on again.  EDIT: So it turned out I was dumb enough to turn iCloud Drive off and don't turn it on again! Been using it this way for some 2 months.  But I've got the solution! (Mac only) I was digging through my iCloud files at code~/Library/Mobile Documents//code and found that there is a folder with the same name of the evil process.  precode~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~TextInput /code/pre  I opened it up and decided to read some files, unzip here, convert plist there (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15179410/how-to-open-icloud-cdt-file) and voilá: in just one file, the process kbd tried to insert a word 147 thousand times. This entry was a correction from "mongolao" to "mongolão" (southern Brazilian idiom in Portuguese for a vulgar use of the word "retarded"), ironic. As there were lots of these files, I think with myself that the problem is that somehow the kbd process fell into a loophole, and I decided to delete all the content of the codecom~apple~TextInput/code folder.  Waited a few minutes for my mac to upload the changes, turned iCloud Drive off and on again on my iPhone and...... working! If I don't come back here to edit this answer it means this was it! (or I forgot something really stupid again)  Oh, and don't even try to boot up Finder to do this, be a good stackExchange user and only use Terminal. (Pro tip: Yosemite breaks the iCloud folder in Finder)  EDIT 3 (3 months later):  strongtldr/strong: run the following on your Mac's terminal:  precodecd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~TextInput rm -rf * /code/pre  <answer169350> Ok, I manage to open some cdt files in plist format. And I see some translations I've added to my phone. How do you see that your phrase was applied 147´000 times?  What did you delete? I'm afraid to delete the wrong stuff :)  s*So, what was the contents of the codecom~apple~TextInput/code catalog. I have this exact issue and it's beginning to be frustrating not being able to type more than, say, 5 characters before the keyboard freezes. My contents are the directories codeDocuments/codeand codeDictionaries/code, where the codeDictionaries/code catalog contains the two folders code.baseline/code and code.cdmetadata/code, emfiles with names like codemobile.23489DF9-CD89-.../code and codemobile~9273434-28347.../code, no extensions here at all./em From your comment I expected some .cdt or .zip-files at least. What did you delete? I'm afraid to delete the wrong stuff :) EDIT: sorry, I found the .cdt files*/s  <comment198963> I deleted everything inside `com~apple~TextInput`, seriously. It's working like a charm ;). I counted the words by using the word counter in TextWrangler (any text editor might have this functionality). <comment200412> I had this terrible issue since I enabled iCloud drive. It was really frustrating. I wasn't able to write on device for 1019€ single sentence without interrupting. I also tryed to contact Apple support without any successful help. But your advice solved the problem! Thank you Gabriel! <comment213558> Updating this history: I've bought an iPhone 6 Plus (awesome device, I shouldn't have bought the iPhone 6) and there it goes: this shit all over again. Thanks old me for this answer.
