How to recover icloud account? <body> I have just bought a Macbook pro. When I install it, I click login to icloud but I forgot question that I use and I don't use email to backup.  I can't speak english good. Please help me recover icloud question for that case  <answer232838> Yeah, iforgot.apple.com. It's also available in your language. As this probably leaves you with nothing seeing as you forgot both email and security questions, your second best shot is Apple Support, which is also available for your country. Try to get on the phone with one of their advisors.  <comment284471> start at https://iforgot.apple.com
