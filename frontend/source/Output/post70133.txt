How to start an app in the foreground? <body> For some reason, codegitk/code always starts under all other apps.  How to make it start on top of all other apps, like a normal program?  Start it from the terminal with the codegitk/code command, which lives in code/usr/bin/code. There is no icon to click on...maybe need to create one?   Or is there a way to tell the OS to start it on top of all others? Perhaps with applescript?  Lion 10.7.5  <answer74917> You will need to edit the gitk file.  To find the location of your codegitk/code file type the following  precodewhich gitk /code/pre  Open the codegitk/code file in a text editor, near the top you should see a line like the following  precodeexec wish "$0" -- "$@" /code/pre  Edit the line so that it looks like this  precodeexec wish "$0" -- "$@" &amp; exec osascript -e "tell application \"Wish\" to activate" /code/pre  The next time you invoke codegitk/code from the terminal it will come to the foreground  Your question is similar to a question on stackoverflow, if you don't want to edit the gitk file you can find other ways to achieve it there https://stackoverflow.com/q/11248284/1873471  <comment87037> Awesome. It worked. Thank you. Didn't think to look on StackOverflow. Live n' learn. <comment87802> This works, but sometimes throws an error `27:35: execution error: An error of type -10827 has occurred. (-10827)`
