How do I retrieve a specific photo from iCloud backup of my camera roll <body> I just received an iPad for Xmas. I took a video through the iPad camera, which was stored in my ipad camera roll. I turned on the iCloud backup of photos previously. Last backup was before I deleted the video. Can I get back just that video without having to restore all iPad contents?  <answer35184> I guess with videos and Photo Stream you're out of luck.    From the iCloud: Photo Stream FAQ:    ul liDoes Photo Stream support video?  ul liNo. Photo Stream only works with photos./li /ul/li /ul  With a local backup you could use something like the iOS Backup Extractor to extract the iOS files, including your video.    Don't know about iCloud backups and extraction of specific parts.  Good luck.
