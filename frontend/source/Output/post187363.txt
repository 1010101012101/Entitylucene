Stop java apps opening full screen? <body> I'm running Mac OS X 10.10.3 with Java 7 update 75 installed (java 8 broke stuff last time I tried "upgrading"), and ever since I installed a certain java application whenever I open ANY java application (not just the last one I installed) it automatically expands to fill the screen. Is there any way to stop this behavior? So far my searching has only turned up ways to program this behavior in specific Java apps, not a way to prevent it, or any sort of global setting that could have been changed to cause it.
