Installation Alert won't go away <body> After a failed installation of updates the following alert won't go away.  It gives me no option to cancel.  Any ideas on how to get rid of it short of rebooting the machine?  Using OSX 10.9.4.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/II42w.png" alt="enter image description here"  Please advise.  <answer145602> Start codeActivity Monitor/code (from Launchpad/Other or via Spotlight).  Find codeiTunes/code in the list and close it. If it's not there then find codeiTunes Helper/code and close that.  The names are present in the codeProcess Name/code column, closing the processes is possible via the codeX/code button situated around the top left corner (of course not the red one, which closes the codeActivity Monitor/code itself, but below that).  <comment169762> you are going to have to reboot. <comment251517> In my case it's Safari, and I'm not running Safari under my login.
