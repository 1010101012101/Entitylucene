Mac Mini server - Dual screens? <body> I'd like to setup dual screens on the new Mac Mini OS X Lion server, however as I understand it you need to use the HDMI port and the thunderbolt port. The only problem I have is I'm already using the thunderbolt port for a thunderbolt drive.  Will a HDMI splitter work? Or a thunderbolt splitter?br / The thunderbolt drive has an extra thunderbolt port in the back (2, I'm only using 1), can I connect the other monitor to that, will that work? I doubt it but I thought I'd ask anyway.  Or, is there another way around this?  <answer51856> You can daisy chain up to 6 Thunderbolt devices from a single port, so you can connect the display via an adapter to that without any problems.  <comment59274> Thank you! :) After reading your answer I decided to plug it in to the thunderbolt drive (seeing as it's technically an adapter) and it works brillaintly! :)
