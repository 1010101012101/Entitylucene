Beachballing causing Macbook Pro to freeze, with possibly failing SSD <body> I have a Macbook Pro Retina 15" codeLate 2013/code model (out of Apple Care protection) running codeSierra v10.12.6/code and it has never frozed up for me until 2 days back, when I was just browsing some pictures via finder when the beachball appeared and it froze. I had to hold the power key to force shutdown it. Upon reboot, the folder with a question mark showed up.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmRFH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I learnt that it shows up when the mac OS can't find a bootable disk so it doesn't know where to boot from. I tried running into internet recovery mode but when I chose disk utility to scan SSD for errors, there was no drive to select. Makes sense if the SSD has failed all of a sudden and it wasn't being detected at all.  I tried rebooting again, it booted up just fine. Ran Disk Utility - First aid option, it told me all is OK. So, I thought of taking up a time machine backup in case I had to change SSD, I can just restore backup. Now, after trying a couple of times, in mid of the backup it would get stuck in a position where Time machine backup has stopped as if I cancelled it. The Time machine application continues to run. In finder, all the folders are gone. The computer is not much responsive at the moment. Again, pointing towards the fact that SSD stopped working in between, and hence backup failed + finder is not showing any folders in its sidebar anymore.  Then yesterday, I tried booting it back, running hardware diagnostics at boot and it reported nothing was wrong with the hardware.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CS2CL.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I tried running SMART status tools too, and here is the report - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/0bbf0b7fb06040443a45320a6c112358  Now the mac's self diagnostics hardware test + SMART status is showing the SSD to be functioning correctly, passing all tests.  So may be its a software problem? Since then I have successfully taken up a timemachine backup. It hasn't crashed without not able to detect the SSD since yesterday but the beachball appeared today and it froze. Upon restart, all is working fine again. I tried checking the codesystem.log/code for the reason of freeze up, but can't find anything significant. I searched for most of the log entries individually on Google.  Here is the portion of codesystem.log/code for today, since I wake it up from sleep, till I had to force restart it - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/39fbe27a6ddee0ed6627bf51edf6eea3  Lastly, here is the attached report out of Etrecheck - https://gist.github.com/ashfame/a0466d6937669cedaebbb027663a48f9  And as I am writing this, I just saw this kernel panic in Etrecheck report, which says codeRoot disk errors: "Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts. Terminating."/code See below:  precodeAnonymous UUID:       B0BCE3F5-A0A7-0F90-F9A1-68EE64312C7E  Sat Jul 29 10:40:56 2017  *** Panic Report *** panic(cpu 6 caller 0xffffff80057fe39d): Kernel trap at 0xffffff7f87e6b447, type 14=page fault, registers: CR0: 0x000000008001003b, CR2: 0xffffff80ed60b118, CR3: 0x0000000008f25000, CR4: 0x00000000001627e0 RAX: 0xffffff8023c27000, RBX: 0xffffff8026b7a000, RCX: 0xffffff80ed60b100, RDX: 0x0000000000000001 RSP: 0xffffff91133a3e00, RBP: 0xffffff91133a3e20, RSI: 0xffffff8024de82a0, RDI: 0xffffff91133a3e00 R8:  0x000000000000ffff, R9:  0x0000000000000001, R10: 0x0000003fffffff01, R11: 0xffffff8026dcd300 R12: 0x0000000100000561, R13: 0xffffff8005c93e40, R14: 0xffffff91133a3e00, R15: 0xffffff8024de8200 RFL: 0x0000000000010286, RIP: 0xffffff7f87e6b447, CS:  0x0000000000000008, SS:  0x0000000000000010 Fault CR2: 0xffffff80ed60b118, Error code: 0x0000000000000002, Fault CPU: 0x6, PL: 0, VF: 10  Backtrace (CPU 6), Frame : Return Address 0xffffff91133a3a90 : 0xffffff80056e953c  0xffffff91133a3b10 : 0xffffff80057fe39d  0xffffff91133a3cf0 : 0xffffff800569a593  0xffffff91133a3d10 : 0xffffff7f87e6b447  0xffffff91133a3e20 : 0xffffff7f87e8210a  0xffffff91133a3e40 : 0xffffff7f87e81ea8  0xffffff91133a3e60 : 0xffffff7f87e81f34  0xffffff91133a3e90 : 0xffffff8005c93f03  0xffffff91133a3ed0 : 0xffffff8005cbaafe  0xffffff91133a3f10 : 0xffffff8005c932f8  0xffffff91133a3f90 : 0xffffff8005c92927  0xffffff91133a3fb0 : 0xffffff80056978f7        Kernel Extensions in backtrace:          com.apple.iokit.IOAcceleratorFamily2(311.14)[13F71024-7246-3AD1-A551-5C186BC70889]@0xffffff7f87e51000-&gt;0xffffff7f87ee0fff             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOPCIFamily(2.9)[3E00E7D2-E569-341D-9BE0-34D5DE491825]@0xffffff7f85f32000             dependency: com.apple.iokit.IOGraphicsFamily(515.3)[A423518D-758D-3021-A111-A59F44D760A8]@0xffffff7f86c2b000  BSD process name corresponding to current thread: kernel_task  Mac OS version: 16G29  Kernel version: Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64 Kernel UUID: D3314D98-5D40-3CD8-98A4-F1DD46C20E03 Kernel slide:     0x0000000005400000 Kernel text base: 0xffffff8005600000 __HIB  text base: 0xffffff8005500000 System model name: MacBookPro11,2 (Mac-3CBD00234E554E41) Root disk errors: "Could not recover SATA HDD after 5 attempts.

If its hardware, I wouldn't like to go through the trouble of setting and configuring everything up again. Could it be just a hardware connection? A loose wire or something? Should I try reinstalling Mac OS? If so, is it advised to start fresh rather than restoring from a time machine backup? I can live without restoring the time machine backup, can access any files manually that I need. My most important things are already backed up. Just wish for a super solid reliable setup that keeps on running like it has been so far. Thanks for taking the time to read through all of it.  <answer293388> Firstly, backup all yourimportant documents that you don't already have a second copy of (if you can). Secondly as IconDaemon suggested, reinstall the OS using internet recovery. Usually I'd suggest just using the local recovery partition but using the external, known good copy of macOS will be beneficial in this case, even though the restore is significantly slower. (Set it up to go over night, it's never very fast, at least not in my area) If the install fails it's likely you have a hardware issue. If the install goes well but the issue persists I'd attempt to wipe your computer complete and then reinstall again. This ensures your user data such as your 3rd party apps aren't causing and issue. Dont do this if you don't have a good backup obviously because you will be losing your data.  Thirdly, and you are starting to run out of options here, I'd try booting to the Internet recovery and installing macOS on a different storage device. This can be a spare hard drive or a large USB stick. This will isolate not only your user data but also the SSD. If this solves the issue you've likely got a faulty SSD. If not it's possible that there is something wrong with you core components or buses - which will likely mean you have a faulty logic board.   Its most likely that your system is corrupt however is also fairly possible your SSD has failed. The steps above should help you determine the cause of the issue but there is no easy way out of diagnosing the issue, you will have to do restores.  <comment370130> Try reinstalling macOS using the Recovery (Command-R) partition. It shouldn't delete any user files or apps. <comment370864> Since then I tried installing OS as is, but the issue slowly became more frequent. Today, I got a fresh OS install done by erasing the disk first at a 3rd party repair center. After using it for a while, all was good until I put it to sleep. Upon wakeup it was frozen. So, NVRAM was cleared by pressing Command (⌘), Option, P, and R. So far, its been running fine since then. Will continue to use & monitor. <comment370865> @IconDaemon I moved forward with that. Please refer to the comment on Trent's answer. <comment371155> Noted! System is running solid since then. Uptime of 2 days & counting. <comment371262> Nice, I'm glad a reinstall fixed the issue for you
