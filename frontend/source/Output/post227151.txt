Broken Windows startup after repartitioning drive <body> I run Windows 10 on my boot camp partition. Yesterday I created a new partition on my disk to store my shared documents between two operating systems by resizing the OS X partition.  Today I noticed that Windows doesn't load.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZbEF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I have the installation media but didn't want to mess with partitions as I know nothing about how boot camp works.  Is there a way I can repair my Windows installation or do I have to reinstall?   <answer228060> One should never try to change drive partitions under Windows (Boot Camp): this makes Windows unbootable. I do afraid that now you have to re-create boot camp partition and reinstall Windows.   Anyway there're (proved by people) ways (see links 1, 2, 3) to achieve what you want.   PS. I personally prefer and recommend external Thunderbolt drive for the 3rd partition shared between mac/windows  <comment278289> I ended up formatting the drive and reinstalling everything.
