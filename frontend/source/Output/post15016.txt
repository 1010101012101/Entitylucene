Why are my DVD disks in the wrong format? <body> I'm trying to play DVDs on my MacBook Pro however the disk doesn't play it doesn't even mount.    When I check Disk Utility it shows the format as Windows NTFS 3G.  If I try the same disks on another macbook it shows as Universal Disk Format (UDF) and plays fine.  How do I fix this?  <answer15145> It appears Parallels is the cause of the issue.  Found some instructions on paragon-software.com and executed step 1. DVDs now working great!  <comment16266> Do other discs work in that drive?  A normal music CD for example? <comment16328> Yes music CDs and software disks are fine. <comment16391> Glad you worked this one out. It was a real head scratcher.
