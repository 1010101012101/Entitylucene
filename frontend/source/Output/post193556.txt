Image Viewer like Windows Image Viewer <body> I want a good image viewer for mac. When I open any random image from a folder like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f5s9v.png" alt="her"  I want to be able to navigate to next/previous image with left and right arrow. Seems so simple but I downloaded 15 image viewers for mac and couldn't find the one I am looking for.   The default imageviewer for Windows does this perfectly.

Select any of the images, tap the Space Bar.br Navigate the way you normally would inside the folder, up/down/left/right arrows.br Tap Space again to close.  This works for more than just pictures, it can handle music, text files, movies etc. &amp; is extendable with new plugins. There's a list here [I don't know how comprehensive] - http://www.quicklookplugins.com  <comment230731> With quicklook you need to use down and up arrows as well to navigate <comment230749> The screencapped pic looks like it is just one of the Icon views in Windows Explorer. So use Icon View in the Finder and then select a slightly larger icon size and you are good to go.
