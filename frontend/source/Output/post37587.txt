How do you disable the iOS Storage full alert? <body> I've been getting close to filling up my 16 GB iPhone 4 with iOS 5. I have freed up some space and have 1.5 GB available, but I keep getting alerts that are annoying.  Is there a way to disable the alert or change the threshold for which it is triggered? brHere's what the alert says.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0UNAv.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <answer37600> Apple do not provide any way to stop what it perceives as important alerts.  That said, for those with jailbroken phones, strongpopup blocker/strong provides the required functionality  Edit: the original question is answered in the most part, but i think the real question should be 'Why am i getting the ios Stoage almost full" alert.  this is either a bug, or you've got a lot of mail stored on the phone...  There appears to be a few users with the same issue over on the Apple support forums here  <answer82861> Definitely a jailbreak issue.  A quick cure would be to, go to notifications; reminders; Alert style: change to none or banners.  I recommend none. Until we get a better fix.   <answer197647> I find it extremely frustrating that Apple holds us in such contempt that it doesn't consider its users to be qualified to decide for themselves how much backup space is necessary, by making this irritating and condescending "error message" (and frankly an unwelcome advertisement) a feature.  <comment42698> Do you know what threshold the space free is triggered at? <comment238489> Right on. This is complete baloney. Self-serving advertisement that pops up EVERY TIME I open photos, delete a photo, and more. So unthoughtful and disrespectful.
