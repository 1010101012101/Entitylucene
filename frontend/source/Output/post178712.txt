MobileBackups is using too much space <body> I am running short of space on my OS partition for some large files I want to install.  I note that codedu/code shows code15G /.MobileBackups/code I have 2 Time Machine drives. One attached to my MacBook Pro (at least when it is not being used as a portable), and a second, which is attached once a week. This was last updated yesterday.  What is using the 15G and why? What would happen if deleted it?  A second issue. codedu/code shows code103G    //code but codeDisk Utility/code says codeUsed 112G/code. Is this the sum of file sizes vs disk space used?  <answer178718> Mobile backups are a part of Time Machine called "snapshots" basically it lets you restore to one of the most recent backups without the need for you time machine disk.   I believe OSX will automatically free up this space when it is need, but it can be turned off manually as well.
