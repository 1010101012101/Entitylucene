How can I configure iCloud mail in Mozilla Thunderbird? <body> i just downloaded Thunderbird from Mozilla because it's the only program I can use to access my hosting email addresses in a easy way, but when I try to add my iCloud account, I get an error.  Here's how I'm trying to configure it (sorry for the Spanish).  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SjlJD.png" alt="Screenshot of Thunderbird&#39;s mail settings pane"  <answer141827> These settings work for me.  Incoming  ul liProtocol: IMAP/li liServer: imap.mail.me.com/li liPort: 993/li liSSL: SSL/TLS/li liAuthentication: Normal password/li /ul  Outgoing  ul liProtocol: SMTP/li liServer: smtp.mail.me.com/li liPort: 587/li liSSL: STARTTLS/li liAuthentication: Normal password/li /ul  Username for both should just be your actual username "karlo_lopez", not your whole email address.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NRbHS.png" alt="Demonstration of correct iCloud settings for Thunderbird"  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If your iCloud account is setup to 2 layer identification, then you need to setup an app-specific password within your Apple ID account. Enter that password instead of your normal iCloud password when setting up the email address into Thunderbird.  <comment252664> Didn't work for me until I save settings and change again username removing the domain.
