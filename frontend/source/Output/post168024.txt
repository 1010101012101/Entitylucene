How to change Mission Control window highlighting <body> Is there a way to change how the selected window in Mission Control is highlighted in Yosemite? Between my aging eyes and background image, it's just a little too subtle for me to easily notice.  <answer180243> There is not an explicit Mission Control picker for the highlight, nor a slider to increase the highlight size.  However, if you go strongSystem Preferences/strong  strongAccessibility/strong  strongDisplay/strong, then you will find a number of adjustments that can help you to distinguish the display elements.  The strongIncrease contrast/strong is a good one because it makes everything a little "sharper."  You can further increase the strongDisplay contrast/strong, though a little goes a long way.  Increasing the strongCursor size/strong might also help, since you'll have an easier time spotting which window is beneath the cursor.  If this still doesn't help, then I'd recommend submitting a feature request to Apple.
