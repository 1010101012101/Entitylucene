Yosemite 10.10.4 nowhere to set three finger tap to access Dictionary <body> I'm in OS X, and I bought my mac from one of my friends. He bought this April,2015.  This is my Force touch trackpad. It's come from the fifth in the first picture. I know you may not understand the language but I am sure there is no three finger tap to look up.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/luzOn.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mRfH.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  I find the three finger to drag in General(the 8th in the third picture)--Mouse/Force Touch trackpad(the fourth picture), but there is no three finger tap to look up, neither.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n5psi.png" alt="enter image description here"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/q73GY.png" alt="enter image description here"  I tried the Better Touch Tool, and it work sometime, but most of the time did not.  I can push the Force Touch trackpad harder to look up the words in Safari, but not three finger tap. And in Chrome, even the push harder not work.  Now I use Command+Control+D to look up words in Chrome, it works, but I really think it is not as easy as three finger tap(I used it in macbook air).  So can anyone tell me how to make it work? or do I need more info for you to understand my question?  <answer199097> Finally, I find this by myself, and it turn out to be so easy.  According to this, I find that it's right in the first picture I post in the question and it's in the top of all and default to force touch but can change to three finger tap.
