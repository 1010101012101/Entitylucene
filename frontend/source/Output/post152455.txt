How do I find what my DPI setting is in OS X? <body> I don't have a retina display, and display settings doesn't show any relevant info. How can I see what my DPI in OS X is?  <answer152588> You can easily calculate DPI on sites like this: https://www.sven.de/dpi/  <comment179609> Nice, however those are "CSS pixels", which aren't always accurate. For instance, visiting on my phone shows a width of 360px, but in fact my phone has a physical width of 1080px. I need true hardware DPI. <comment273075> you can edit your actual hardware DPI in the input fields. <comment273078> I have added support for retina displays by querying `window.devicePixelRatio` so the correct screen resolution should now appear on retina devices.
