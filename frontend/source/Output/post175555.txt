How do can I close all windows on Preview and OpenOffice, so they don't open again when I open Preview to see something else? <body> Every time I view an image using Preview, it gets stored, and when I open preview again, everything is there, like this- img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hyPlA.png" alt="enter image description here"  How can I clear that?  Thanks   (for reference- I use Yosemite on a MacBook Pro)  <answer175561> Firstly, to prevent it happening again, remember to close a document before you Quit, otherwise it will reopen on launch.  To clear the existing list, With both apps quit, go to code~/Library/Saved Application State//code    &amp; delete the two saved state folders, codecom.apple.Preview.savedState/code &amp; the same for OpenOffice [I don't have the app so not certain of the name.]  Done.  hr  Quick way to get there, if you're not sure…  ul liFrom Finder, hit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd N /kbd for New Window/li liHit kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd G /kbd for Go…/li liPaste code~/Library/Saved Application State//code including the tilde ~/li /ul  <comment207066> Please clarify what you are trying to do. Your question references clearing the items listed as recently opened, while the title of your question references not reopening windows which were open when a program was last closed.
