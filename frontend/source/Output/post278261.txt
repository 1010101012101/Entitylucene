USB-C wall charger <body> Why is it that Apple has not released a USB-C iPhone wall charging block?  I heard it may have to do with how much power USB-C can output but I don't understand it exactly.   Can someone explain.  <answer278265> The wall portion of the charger is irrelevant to charging an iPhone. As long as you have a lightning cable the phone and charger will not charge faster than the phone can handle.   Apple does sell a Lightning to USB-C cable that can be used with Apple's wall adapters that use USB-C (29W, 61W, 87W) just fine. Purchasing that cable and any of those adapters will allow you to charge your iPhone with USB-C via the wall - or just the cable will allow charging via a USB-C compatible laptop.  edit: for what it's worth, you can also use the larger iPad chargers on iPhones. All of these larger chargers will charge your phone faster than the included charger up to the maximum allowed by the phone's power management circuitry.  <comment350154> Charging an iPhone through the 29W or 87W wall chargers won't endanger the phones battery? <comment350155> As long as a charger provides the voltage appropriate for the connection there will not be a problem. The phone will use only the amps required. <comment350162> please see [meta] and [help] for details - asking why apple has done X is off topic. Instead please edit to explain that give X was done, how could you do Y and the hold will be reviewed. <comment350192> @huddie96 - See this [answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/271794/119271) for an explanation as to why you won't damage anything using a charger with a higher rating.
