Office 2016 package will not install <body> I'm trying to install Office 2016 and it appears as though Installer will not run/install the .pkg file. When you double click on the package itself it instantly exits, leaving behind these errors:  codeCoreServicesUIAgent[323]: Error -60005 creating authorization/code  and  codecom.apple.xpc.launchd[1]: (com.apple.xpc.launchd.oneshot.0x10000011.Installer[859]) Service exited due to signal: Broken pipe: 13 /code  I've tried repairing disk permissions and rebooting (multiple times) as well as re-downloading the package from MSFT, no luck. Any ideas?  <answer209284> The (odd) answer to this question turned out to be a corrupted installer that came from our implementation of O365. When provided with a different installer it worked fine.  <comment249618> Is your account an Administrator or Standard account? If Standard, try using an Administrator account to install the package. <comment249637> It's an Administrator account. <comment249640> Then in `System Preferences  Security & Privacy  General` tab authenticate by clicking the lock icon in the lower left, then select the `Anywhere` radio button in the `Allow apps downloaded from:` section & try to open the .pkg file again. <comment249733> Good idea, but that didn't change anything either :( <comment249757> Q: What version of OS X is on your Mac/Mac specs? This [page](https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements) lists the OS requirements. It looks like 10.10 is the minimum spec for OS X. Next troubleshooting step: create a new Administrator account & download/install the .pkg again. If you've installed the Office '16 Preview, you probably want to uninstall it. <comment249815> 10.10.5 - don't have the preview installed, but do have Office 2011 installed. <comment249838> I am also having this exact same issue. I tried repairing disk permissions and installing in safe mode. Nothing happens. Frustrating!
