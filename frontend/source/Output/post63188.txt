Lion/Mountain Lion Mission Control used with CTRL+# (10.6 Spaces-like) <body> Is there a way to still use kbdControl/kbd+kbd#/kbd (e.g. kbdControl/kbd+kbd1/kbd, kbdControl/kbd+kbd2/kbd, ...) to switch to a particular Desktop? In Spaces' parlance: to a particular Space? I have difficulties swiping the trackpad and could use the old shortcut?  Also: Could I configure a particular App to open in a particular Desktop number, like in Snow Leopard?  <answer63212> In strongLion/strong, by default, will switch to a particular Desktop if you hit kbdControl/kbd+emDesktop's Number/em. Go to strongSystem Preferences / Keyboard / Shortcuts / Mission Control/strong and check if you've overwritten this shortcut.   Yes, you can configure a particular App to open in a particular Desktop. To do so just:  ol liNavigate to that particular Desktop./li liOpen the App you want to assign, if its already not on the Dock, and right click on it./li liA contextual men√∫ will show up. Under strongOptions/strong you'll see a submenu called emAssign to/em and three different options. emAll Desktops, This Desktop/em or emNone/em. Select emThis Desktop/em./li /ol  <comment73018> It's Mountain Lion and I first need to create all the Desktops and then individually assign the shortcuts (CTRL+1, CTRL+2, ...). Absurd!!!
