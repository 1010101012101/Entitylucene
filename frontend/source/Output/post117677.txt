Mac Grapher Complex Error Function <body> I understand the the Grapher app in Mac OS X comes with erf and erfc, the error function and complementary error function. However, when I define  precodey = Re[erfc(-ix)], /code/pre  the Grapher app just returns y(x) = 0 for all values of x. Is it not possible to give this function complex values?  <answer117679> You may well find that somewhere in there the complex number is being flattened and you will need to use the complex() function to protect it from that.
