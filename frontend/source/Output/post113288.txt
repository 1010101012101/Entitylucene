Mute volume of macbook on sleep <body> I was wondering if there was any way to mute my macbook whenever I physically close it, so if there was anything playing prior to closing it that it does not continue to make noise when I open it later.  Seems like a weird request, but I have a bad habit of forgetting to pause my music/youtube  when I leave for class, than when I open my laptop in class it disrupts the class.   The easy answer would be, "just pause your stuff", but I thought it would be nice if there was something that could accomplish this.  <answer113291> Use the API that provides a sleep notifications to write an app that gets a callback when the system is about to sleep. Inside the callback, set the system volume to mute.  <answer113437> ol liDownload SleepWatcher (free, source code included)./li liInstall it using the instructions included in the download./li liHave your 'sleep' script call codeosascript/code (AppleScript)  /usr/bin/osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'/li /ol  Now your Mac will be muted anytime your computer goes to sleep.  If you want to make extra sure that it is muted when it wakes from sleep, add  precode/usr/bin/osascript -e 'set volume with output muted' /code/pre  to your 'wake' script as well.  <answer258379> The app Auto Mute automatically mute the volume on sleep. And it's free.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/siTlw.png" alt="Settings of Auto Mute"  <comment133103> It seems fairly unlikely that the average person reading this post is going to be able to use the advice to "write an app". <comment133121> @TJLuoma yeah, that is a good point.
