Cannot see or delete photos from "Synced from iTunes Library" <body> I have an iPhone 6S and Windows PCs. I do not sync photos between the iPhone and PCs. I have about 716MB of space occupied by photos "Synced from iTunes Library" that I cannot see on the iPhone, or have any way to delete them. These photos cannot be found in iCloud either. So this post did not resolve my issue: Some photos aren&#39;t displayed when iPhone connected to PC  I already deleted all of the photos in the Photos app, but I still have the 716MB occupied and have no way to get rid of it. What do I do?  Only 1 photo left in Photos app: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aAGhh.png" alt="enter image description here"  Still 716MB "Synced from iTunes Library": img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlaqH.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer268102> Are you able to turn on photo syncing in iTunes? We could try syncing a photo, and then turning off syncing again to see if it deletes the old synced files.  <comment336170> Possible duplicate of [Some photos aren't displayed when iPhone connected to PC](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/267842/some-photos-arent-displayed-when-iphone-connected-to-pc)
