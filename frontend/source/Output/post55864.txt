Strange issue with Apple wireless keyboard on my iMac: Shift + W won't work <body> I noticed this problem earlier today, pressing left shift + W to type a capital W does not work. I can get a capital W by using the right shift key, or the caps-lock, but not with the left shift, which works fine for all other letters. Basically, left shift + W does not do anything.  <comment64116> Does it work fine with a different keyboard? It may be an issue with the keyboard. <comment64119> The problem just went away, works fine now. I don't think it was a hardware issue as the shift key worked fine with other letters, and the W key worked fine without pressing left-shift. Still would like to know what caused it! <comment64179> If it happens again, check for a shift + W hotkey. Is there any app that was open when it wasn't working and closed when it started working again?
