iOS 10 doesn't auto full screen 3 x 2 photos <body> I just upgraded to iOS 10.   I crop all my photos to 3 x 2 and have been doing this for years. Before iOS version 10 it would always display those photos slightly zoomed in, to fill the entire iPhone 6 screen, and remove any black borders.  Since the update it doesn't do this anymore. Is there a setting to get this functionality back?  I know I could crop 16 x 9 to get full screen pics, but I find that size too limiting, especially in portrait mode.
