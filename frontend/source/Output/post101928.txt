Partitioning Software <body> Is there an equivalent on the Mac platform to Partition Magic or GParted that will allow me to resize, move, and/or change partitions on the fly without formatting, or disturbing the data that is already on the disk?   <answer101929> h2iPartition/h2  For all my partitioning, I use and recommend iPartition. It will allow you to resize partitions without deleting any data. It also works for Boot Camp volumes and other PC disks.     With iPartition, resizing a partition is as simple as selecting it, grabbing the resize handle and dragging. Not only that, but if you have several operations to perform, iPartition lets you queue them up and run them one after another, so you can have a cup of coffee while iPartition works. This feature, coupled with iPartition’s ability to automatically rearrange your existing partitions when necessary, makes iPartition the easiest partitioning tool that you’ll ever use.      img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wVrAR.jpg" width="600"   <answer102044> Disk Utility can do non-destructive partitioning (add or remove) but cannot emmove/em partitions.  This functionality was added in Lion, I believe.  The key is to click on the right thing. Note the following image:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysay2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  ol liYou have to select the 'root' of the drive, not any of the existing partitions (see arrow #1)/li liClick on 'Partition'/li liYou can change the current partition scheme my selecting the drop down./li liIf you select one of the existing partitions, you can use the +/- buttons to delete a partition or break it into a smaller size./li /ol  I have done this many times and have only had it fail on me once, early in the life of the functionality, however that one time emdid/em leave me with an unusable drive that I had to reformat and restore from backup.  Which is my way of saying: make sure you have a emverified/em backup before you start mucking around with partitions, regardless of which app you use.  <answer141899> H2Stellar Partition Manager/H2  Stellar Partition Manager allows you to create, delete, resize, hide, and unhide partitions on your Mac.

Having re-read the question it seems that I've inferred something that doesn't exist :) <comment120060> @grgarside - I would assume the simplest cases on any question as a more complex question should say what they have tried and why the simple answers don't work. You might want to raise a question giving a case which you can't use Disk Utility and then answer explaining what iPartiton does in a bit more detail thatn you gave <comment120061> Disk Utility does not do non-destructive partitioning, unless I'm missing something in the interface. <comment120062> This is precisely what I was looking for as an alternative. <comment120219> Disk Utility has failed me more than once. I do not trust it other than to create the initial partition. That's why I sought a better tool, which iPartition definitely appears to be. <comment120249> It should be noted that you can resize the partition using Disk Utility IF the partition schema is not MBR. A utility like iPartition, however, allows you to change the schema. <comment347075> For some reason the free / demo version won't let me view the partitioning of a disk so it's impossible to see if this tool is any good.
