Home and End commands in Lion <body> After installing Lion, kbd⌘/kbd + kbd←/kbd doesn't go to the line start and kbd⌘/kbd + kbd→/kbd doesn't go to the line end.  Anyone know how to reconfigure this?  <answer18674> You could try restoring defaults by using the 'Restore Defaults' button in System Preferences shown below:    img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HTTqY.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer18769> Removing ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist.lock and logging out and back in did the trick for me.  <answer32095> This problem was driving me crazy.

I didn't have a file with that name, but I had one with this very similar name: strong~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.universalaccess.plist/strong  I moved that file to the trash, then logged out and back in. Problem gone. Hooray!  Thank you, Mr. Gentz!  <answer32097> Coming from Windows I've had a tough time adjusting to the way home and end behaves. Luckily the guys at MacroMates had a blog post about this.  http://blog.macromates.com/2005/key-bindings-for-switchers/  Create a file at code~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict/code with the following contents:  precode{     /* home */     "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";     "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";      /* end */     "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";     "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:"; } /code/pre  I restarted and my keys were behaving as expected!  <answer33120> It seems to have something to do with the language you selected.  I had mine set to English - Canadian (eh :P)  setting Language &amp; Text  Input Sources   uncheck English - Canadian  check US  Once I did that my cmd + arrow key was back to normal.  <answer51420> Option + Command + right arrow (on the latest Lion update -- it changes)  <comment19633> Hmm… this works for me on a MacBook Pro running Lion. Tried it in TextEdit and BBEdit. <comment19634> Which programs is this happening in? It still works for me - though I do prefer using Control-A and Control-E respectively instead. <comment19636> at the time I wrote this question it was not working anywhere. Now it's working everywhere, and I did nothing specific :S <comment20552> Have the same issue. But this tip doesn't help. <comment24840> Same for me: it suddenly did not work some time after the Lion upgrade, and a few days later it worked again, without restart or logging off. <comment27187> For me, home and end commands work *only* if I highlight the text with Shift key down. <comment29131> Same for me: Home and End commands started on their own, without any configuration changes. No software update was ran that would explain this sudden change.
