Bluetooth speaker connecting as bluetooth keyboard <body> I have an issue with my Bluetooth speaker connecting to MacBook Air (macOS Sierra).  My Bluetooth is showing as keyboard input while connecting. The same problem exists when connecting to my Android device also. But on my android phone, there is an option to disable input from it, after that it works fine as audio output.  However, in my mac, I didn't find an option to disable the input and hence not able to play music. The device is detected as a keyboard and hence not popping up in sound devices. Googled a lot, didn't find any answer though.  Do someone faced the same issue, is there any workaround for it.
