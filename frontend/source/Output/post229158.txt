Python socket program taking forever to run <body> I tried to run following program on my Mac terminal.   precodeimport socket mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) mysock.connect(('www.py4inf.com', 80)) mysock.send('GET http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n')  while True:     data = mysock.recv(512)     if ( len(data) &lt; 1 ) :         break     print data; mysock.close() /code/pre  But it doesn't print anything and takes forever.  I tried some online platform to execute and got error message     """Traceback (most recent call last): File "main.py", line 6, in    mysock.connect(('www.py4inf.com', 80)) File   "/usr/lib64/python2.7/socket.py", line 228, in meth return   getattr(self._sock,name)(*args) socket.error: [Errno 110] Connection   timed out"""   I put print statement after True: and before line "data = " and it prints statement there and then takes forever.  My Python environment is  precode"Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 14 2015, 19:46:27) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.39)] on darwin" /code/pre  And in different computer, it works.  Can anybody identify an issue?  <answer229233> In the section where it says:    precodemysock.connect(('www.py4inf.com', 80)) /code/pre  There may be a slow internet connection - hence the fact its taking so long.  Also, clever python emulation websites won't let you run sockets on their emulators as you can spoof your IP and that can cause CyberSecurity issues.  <answer232622> Your program runs well on my MAC OS Mavericks (aka 10.9.5) with Python 2.7.5 It prints:  precodeHTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 27 Mar 2016 07:42:22 GMT Server: Apache Last-Modified: Fri, 04 Dec 2015 19:05:04 GMT ETag: "e103c2f4-a7-526172f5b5d89" Accept-Ranges: bytes Content-Length: 167 Cache-Control: max-age=604800, public Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Allow-Headers: origin, x-requested-with, content-type Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET Connection: close Content-Type: text/plain  But soft what light through yonder window breaks It is the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fai r sun and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief /code/pre  I guess your program stuck while no answer was available within the TCP protocol time-out (either the server not responding or the link failing). If you want to avoid such case, you may put the "recv" statement in a separate thread and break after a time-out. I found much help for this in this page: eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/05/18/code-sample-socket-client-thread-in-python/  Hope this helps.  <comment279491> Please format code using markdown - see the FAQ - also please show code as text not a screenshot so we can copy, run and test it. Also can you connect to that URL on that computer using telnet etc
