Newbie One Hard Disk Two OS X How To? <body> I am a long time Windows User, but newbie on OS X  This is a wonderful OS I use.  I have a macbook pro with 500GB HDD inside.  I want to one HDD install both OS X 10.8.5 and OS X 10.10.2, plus one more partition for save data, so when as need, I format any two OS X partition will not data lose... (So Total 3 partition base on my case there).  But I search APPLE official KB, not find any document as example like my case, just only see how to install the OS X on ext HDD only (Not the way I want to be).  So .... anyone can tell me how to do above? OR can it?  MacBook Pro, OS X Mountain Lion (10.8.5)   <answer171328> I final do this with disk utility, then partition with 4. Each with different name etc such as OS X 10.10, OS X 10.9, OS X 10.8 etc.  Then make the USB stick install OS X one by one and when installing choose install to which partition.  <comment200503> How you proceed depends on a few things. What model of MacBook Pro do you have? Do you currently have an OS installed on the internal hard drive? <comment200542> The partitioning & install should be easy - see Disk Utility, in Applications/Utilities. Make sure you have a backup just in case. The difficult part might be getting hold of 10.8.5. Unless you already 'bought' it from the App Store, there's no way to get it from Apple. <comment200549> @JimmyChan Please also add the fill level of your HDD and do you have an external hard disk? <comment200778> I am using 2010 Mid 15"
