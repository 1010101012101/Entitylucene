How to diagnose kernel_task mem usage? <body> I'm on the 10.12.2 w/ 2013 MBA w/ 4GB of RAM (can't upgrade). It seems unreasonable that my system boots up with the kernel taking 600 MB of RAM - what are my options to see if there are some tweaks I can make to reduce usage?  I've read the other threads on high-cpu-usage but didn't see any easy wins ...  <comment336378> Not quite a dupe, but this contains the answer - http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/37366/what-exactly-does-kernel-task-do?rq=1
