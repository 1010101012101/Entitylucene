Page Up/Down on Adobe reader on mac <body> When a new document is opened, the Left/Right arrows work properly for Page Up / Page Down.  However after having browsed in the document, it frequently occurs that Left/Right arrows only move single emcharacters/em to the left/right.  I have not been able to discover  ul liwhat sequence of browsing causes the behavior to change/li lihow to revert the behavior back to full page incrementing/li /ul  Tips appreciated.  <answer168067> After opening a new pdf the cursor doesn't really exist and depending on your settings Left/Right arrows work properly for Page Up / Page Down.  As soon as you move the cursor into the document you will navigate inside your pdf and Page Up / Page Down won't work anymore with the Left/Right arrow keys.  To restore the previous behavior just click on the dark grey background. That's a bit difficult if View - Zoom is set to 'Fit Width', because the gap between document and frame is very small and hard to hit with the cursor.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/s1lHI.png" alt="gap"  <answer225356> Press the esc key to navigate out of the document edit/select mode. The Left/Right arrow keys should then work again the same as before.  <comment197145> Clicking on the dark background does the trick. thanks.
