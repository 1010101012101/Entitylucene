How to delete photos <body> I want to delete photos in the new photos app but can't find any delete or trash icon. Where is it?   I tried highlighting the photos I want to delete, but I can't find the trash icon. I understand there is a selection to permanently delete but can't find it either?  <answer186590> I figured it out!!! You highlight the desired photos you wish to delete, then press the delete button. They are then moved to a recently deleted album.
