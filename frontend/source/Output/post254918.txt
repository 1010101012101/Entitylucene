How can I possibly customise ring tone? <body> I found apple's product very difficult to use. ios10, iphone6s. After I connect it with my MAC pro, in the pop up itune, I cannot drag a mp3 file which is only 2 seconds, and another mp3 file 35 seconds to itune "device -tone" section.  I found answer in this website, in music, right click and choose convert to something, but I don't have this convert to something after right click on the music.....wooops,fall down at the beginning.  Could anyone show me some images how can I possibly change the tone? (very complicated phone!)  This is not a duplicate question of what was asked SIX years ago, times has changed.  <comment317592> The process in the [accepted answer](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/1885/54484) (last edited three years ago) is the exact same process that is used today, with one small exception (and I've now edited step #3 to fix that issue). This question is still a duplicate. If it's not, explain how it's not. Show your research - what steps did you try that did not work? Saying "I tried some steps on some website somewhere and they didn't work" doesn't tell us what didn't work or help us help you fix it. <comment317593> @tubedogg In one solution: once you connect the iphone, drag the less than 39 second music to the device-tone page. result: drag there but not showing there, like nothing happened. In another solution: drag it to the music (which i cannot drag with the same phenomena as tone). In the third solution: in the music page, right click on your music, and click "convert to XXX", which I can't either, because in the menu it does not have such an item. Now you want to tell me a forth solution? <comment317594> If you follow the link I put in my comment above for the accepted answer, I updated step #3 to reflect the current way to get to the Convert option. The rest of the process is the same as it was before.
