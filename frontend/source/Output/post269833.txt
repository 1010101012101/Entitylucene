OAuth alternative for iCloud Account login to use with third party apps <body> While reading the FAQ's for unroll.me, I came across this interesting information:     Does Unroll.me store my login information?      In short, if you have a Gmail, Outlook.com or Yahoo account, we never have access to your login info.       If you have a AOL, or iCloud account, we do. We're hoping these services release a public version of OAuth soon.   I am quite surprised that with the insistence on security that Apple has, it does not have a way for third party apps to not have access to direct credential but instead to a token like in OAuth.  Thus wanted to check what would be an alternative to OAuth to have a token instead.
