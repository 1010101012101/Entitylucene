iPad sending to iPhone via iMessage <body> My iPad will not send an iMessage to 3 of my contacts.  I have been iMessaging with them for years, they are family and all have iPhones and haven't changed anything with their carriers, usage, etc.  All of a sudden I got the Not Delivered Message.  Can anyone help me figure this out?  <answer140744> It's hard to figure out what's the actual problem without more information or being at the scene. Some simple fixes you may try:  ul liRestart your iPad./li liMake sure you are not in airplane mode./li liMake sure you have interact connection. You can test by browsing a webpage./li liGo to 'Contact's and double check if their phone numbers (including country code) and/or apple id emails are correct./li liTest whether you can message others. If so, it might be your family's side's issue./li /ul
