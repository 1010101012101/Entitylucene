My hard drive doesn't work but Bootcamp work <body> For two days my mac is "dead", the hard drive crashed, so I reformat (twice). Then via the Recovery I wanted to reinstall Mavericks but at the end of the proceedings it appears to me there remains nearly 1million minutes and the process stops. I thought it was the hard drive that is dead but the Windows (BootCamp) part works very well.  Then, I wanted to make a bootable USB of it (Using mac air wich is running on codeOS X Mavericks GM/code) but when I tried to run the command for copying the files from code.app/code to codeUSB/code I got the following error :     Erasing Disk:   0%... 10%...   Error erasing disk error number (-69888, 0)   A error occurred erasing the disk.    My mac is a macbook pro 17'.  So now I really don't know how can I proceed.  Thanks you in advance  <answer135698> We are dealing with 2 different problems.   To create a bootable USB you will need a Mavericks Installer package from Apple Store the 5.5 Gig file saved to MBA- but not run.  I used this proces to make a bootable USB:  Bootable USB Format it, using Disk Utility, as a Mac OS Extended (Journaled) drive, named Mavericks.  This can be done from the Erase tab within the app; make sure the USB drive does not have multiple partitions (that can happen, so turn to the Partition tab to verify and correct this).  Open Terminal.  precodesudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Mavericks --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ Mavericks.app --no interaction. /code/pre     Erasing Disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%...100%...      Copying installer files to diskâ€¦(this part can take 30 minutes)      Copy complete.      Making disk bootable...      Copying boot files...      Copy complete.      Done.   If problems reoccurs get another USB stick with minimum of 8 Gig capacity (not partitioned).  ul listrongSecond problem:/strong/li /ul  Repairing your Hard drive:  If the MBP boots in the Recovery mode using cmd-r then follow that process to restore your OS installation, or use the Disk Utility to check/repair the disk.  You can open the terminal and use the fsck -fy to check repair the disk.  If the problem is minor you can start in Safe mode that will correct some minor issues.  <answer150506>    Erasing Disk: 0%... 10%... Error erasing disk error number (-69888, 0) A error occurred erasing the disk   This error will occur if the usb stick and the main drive have the same name - typically: Untitled  The instructions for creating an OS X usb installation stick typically suggest that the usb stick should be called Untitled. But that would also be the default name of the main drive if it has been reformatted. The solution is to name the usb stick something else and change the command to reflect the new name.  You can check for a name clash in terminal:  precodecd /Volumes ls /code/pre  If there is a Volume called Untitled and another called Untitled 1 then the error is occurring because the command you have issued is trying to erase the main drive and not the usb stick.  <answer155559> The solution may be actually easier than you think!  If you get codeError erasing disk error number (-69888, 0) A error occurred erasing the disk./code message when trying to create a bootable USB, make sure the USB drive is not currently used by the system or your apps (think open Finder windows or current directory in Terminal).  <answer287008> The problem in our case was a space after code/Volumes//code in the command. That occurred when we copied the command from a website.  So check for spaces if you copied the command!  <comment160861> So you have actually a question about how to create a bootable USB via your Macbook Air? <comment160868> Thanks, I tried to use Disk Utility to format my Hard drive but when I check the disk it is said that my disk must be repaired but it doesn't work too. <comment160869> @Rob Yes, because in this way perhaps I can solve my first problem. <comment160870> In that case you can try the fsck -fy as your last resort. <comment252530> I think this should be the accepted answer. I had opened it in another Terminal window. Closed it and the error disappeared!
