VLC won't become default for MP3 or MP4 <body> I have tried a number of times to make VLC Media player the default for MP3 and MP4. I open a file and tick the "Always open with" checkbox, but they still open with iTunes and QuickTime by default respectively. Does anyone know how to fix this?  <answer3943> You can use utility like Magic Launch to do that.  <answer3979> Try one of these 2 solutions I hope they'll solve your problem:  1-  use "Default Apps" for change every default application.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nBnJN.jpg" alt="alt text"  2- From the Finder, select a MP-4 file, open the Info panel (codeFile/code ➔ codeGet Info/code or kbd⌘/kbdkbdI/kbd), select your preferred application and then click codeChange All…/code  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUjID.jpg" alt="alt text"  <comment3775> So "Always open with" only applies to one file? <comment3776> @Casebash, Yes if you "Always open with" it just work for the specific file(s).
