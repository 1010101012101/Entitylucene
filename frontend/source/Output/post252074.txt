Why is AHT not loading <body> This question is exactly the same as this question, however, Alt (Option) + D did not work for me.   I tried using both an apple wireless keyboard and a wired Windows keyboard. I don't have a problem booting into safe mode or recovery mode with either, so I know the problem isn't with the keyboard set up.   I was able to reinstall OSX from the recovery partition, so the computer does have Internet access.   I have a late 2009 27" iMac i7  <comment313563> Best guess is it's not in the firmware on an old iMac, you'd need to boot from the original CD/DVD <comment313564> Oh boy. Since I don't have the original, is it possible to copy it from another Mac? <comment313565> You'd need the original disks for that exact model. Apple would be your best source, though it might be simpler to take it to an Apple Store & see what they can do <comment313570> Hm. Do you know what model first included it in the firmware? <comment313571> Sorry, no - I'm basing my guesswork on https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201257 linked from the other question & that Lion was released 2011, making your machine likely to have been supplied with Snow Leo. <comment313572> Try [this](http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Hardware_Test/022-4776-A.dmg) AHT. The AHT is for iMac11,3 but iMac11,1 has the same model identifier. Comprehensive list: [Apple Hardware Test (AHT)](https://github.com/upekkha/AppleHardwareTest).
