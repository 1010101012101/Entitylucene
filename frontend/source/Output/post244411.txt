How to open a file with automator and then open another file when the first file is closed? <body> I have a series of spreadsheets that I work with daily. Is there a way to use Automator to open the first spreadsheet and when I close it because I'm done with it open the next spreadsheet?  Thank you.  Here's the a screenshot of Alphaman's solution: img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/A3TSj.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer244413> You can use the emopen/em command with the -W option to wait until you close the program. You can hardcode the list in an Automator emRun Shell Script/em action where your command lines would look like the following:  precodeopen -W ~/Documents/firstSpreadSheet.numbers open -W ~/Documents/secondSpreadSheet.numbers open -W ~/Documents/thirdSpreadSheet.numbers /code/pre  Note that you must completely exit out of Numbers (e.g., cmd-Q) for the next file to open; closing the window is not sufficient.  <comment301269> Wow. That's super cool! Thank you Alphaman.
