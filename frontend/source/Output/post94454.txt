Trackpad, mouse will not click. Command+Tab switcher is invisible <body> I've had this issue come up about four times now on my 15" retina Macbook Pro, running Mac OS X 10.8.4.  The trackpad will no longer click â€” neither right nor left click works. Regardless of whether I tap the pad or press the physical click mechanism.  The computer remains responsive via the keyboard and the mouse cursor still moves. However the following symptoms occur:  ul liCmd+Space for the Spotlight menu does not work/li liCmd+Tab switches between applications but the visual switcher does not display/li liI am able to open apps via the terminal, and force quit them via Cmd+Opt+Esc/li liPlugging in an external mouse via USB exhibits the same behaviour (movement only, no response to clicks)/li /ul  The only thing I've found that resolves this problem is a restart, which I am able to do via the keyboard. I have attempted to kill all open applications but this does not solve the issue.  Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? I ask because next time this happens I would like to avoid restarting my computer.  <comment140692> Since you can get to your Terminal, try running: killall Dock <comment140726> did you install any third party mouse software (i.e. microsoft intellimouse)? <comment187260> I'm having the same issues. did you resolve it?
