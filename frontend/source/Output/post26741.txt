iPad camera to cloud <body> I'm looking for a emtruly basic/em app that takes photos with the built-in camera and uploads them somewhere in the cloud.  I stress embasic/em because I need my photos to be easily programmatically reused without a lot of translation (glue code) on my part.  For example: a Media RSS feed with nothing but the photos themselves, or a WebDAV folder.  <answer29977> Apparently this is the functionality of Photo Stream on iCloud. Requires iOS5 and Lion (or a recent Windows version) though.  <comment30516> Your looking for Photo Stream on iCloud. Does exactly this. Alternatively you can use Instagram to take basic photos.
