How do I manage user access privileges to the system keychain? <body> I don't want my secondary account on my Mac to have access to the system keychain. The reason for this is that I don't want it to automatically have access to and connect to the different Wi-Fi networks that I have saved on my primary account. Is there any way to deny access to the system keychain when I'm logged in on my secondary account?
