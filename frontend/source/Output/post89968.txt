How do I type the typeset "space" character? <body> I've used the Keyboard Viewer a few times, and disappointingly have never seen the "space" character: code␣/code  Is it possible to type this character directly via some combination of meta keys (option/shift)?  <answer89972> There doesn't seem to be any way to insert it using the default U.S. input source or other normal keyboard layouts:  precode$ grep -r '&amp;#x2423;' /Volumes/Ukelele\ 2.2.4/System\ Keyboards/ $ /code/pre  Unicode Hex Input is the only keylayout that uses multipliers. If you use Unicode Hex Input, you can insert code␣/code by typing 2423 while holding option.  Or create code~/Library/KeyBindings//code and save a property list like this as DefaultKeyBinding.dict:  precode{     "~S" = (insertText:, "␣"); // option-shift-s } /code/pre  You could also make a new keyboard layout or add characters to the press and hold popovers. I'm currently using an AppleScript (posted in this question) to insert special characters and plain text snippets.  <comment105687> This is really nice information. Since I'm bad at memorizing Unicode keycodes, and KeyBindings are unlikely to be synchronized, I implemented it into TextExpander, like I've already done that for ⌘ and ‽ and ∞. But this information is amazing. Thank you very much for it.
