Cursorcerer, change delay from terminal <body> I use Cursorcerer to hide my pointer, and find that I cannot turn it off completely unless I set the delay to 0 sec; otherwise it pops up when I change app &amp;c. On the other hand, if I need it, I also need it to change the setting in the pr√¶ference pane. Can the delay be changed from terminal?  <answer207399> From Terminal, you should be able to do  precodedefaults write com.doomlaser.cursorcerer idleHide -float 0 /code/pre  and then  precodekillall Cursorcerer ~/Library/PreferencePanes/Cursorcerer\ 2.prefpane/Contents/Resources/Cursorcerer.app/Contents/MacOS/Cursorcerer &amp; /code/pre  to quit and relaunch the Cursorcerer daemon with the updated pref
