Secret way to trigger Thesaurus on Mac OS X? <body> Not really sure how to ask since I have no idea what just happened, but I'll try my best :-)  I just typed "I" into a textfield here on Yosemite and then tried to click on an icon in the Mac OS status bar (with the option key and some other key pressed AFAIK), but I missed and the next thing I saw was a dropdown that contained the entries "He", "She", "It", "You", "We", ...I am unable to reproduce and would like to know what this was and how to  make it happen again?  <answer163114> You may have seen Spotlight. It has a built in Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Calculator. It's a little magnifying glass in the menu bar, towards the top and right of the screen.  What you probably hit was kbdstrong⌥Option/strong/kbd+kbdstrong⌘Command/strong/kbd+kbdstrong⇧Shift/strong/kbd.  <answer163122> It is possible that you pressed the kbdesc/kbd key. Yosemite has a similar feature to iOS 8's QuickType keyboard that "intelligently predicts" what you are trying to type. It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NkI1.png" alt="Predictive text menu on OS X Yosemite"  Is this what appeared?  <answer163123> What I think you saw is the writing suggestions, accessible by pressing kbdEsc/kbd.                                                              img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jmW8e.png" width="126"  <comment191107> That is it! Is that new in Yosemite? <comment191108> It is. It wasn't really advertised, which is why many people don't know about it. <comment191109> But it's not working everywhere (just tried in a new email). Found this for reference: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2014/09/04/new-quicktype-like-feature-found-in-os-x-yosemite/ <comment191110> That's true. I've found it only works in certain text areas. As an OS X developer, I've managed to get it working in NSTextViews, but not all text areas. I'm not entirely sure on what determines whether or not it is available in a given place.
