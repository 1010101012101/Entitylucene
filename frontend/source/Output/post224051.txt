Cannot create a dmg file and save it onto a usb flash drive. Error: Unable to create " ". (Operation not Permitted) <body> I currently am trying to create dmg files from folders inside my 128 GB flash drive. I recently re-formatted it into the exFAT format. The folders I am trying to convert into a dmg file are around 15 GB each. It appears that when I choose to create an image file and save it onto the flash drive (with plenty of space remanining), I get an error that says "Unable to create "(filename)". (Operation not Permitted)". However, when I drag that same file out onto my desktop, and then do the same thing but save onto my flash drive, it works. It appears also that certain folders will allow me to both have the original file on the drive, and also allow me to save the dmg file onto the drive.  So the basic problem seems that whenever I try to create a dmg file from a folder ON my flash drive and save it back ONTO my flash drive, it yields the error. Does anyone know what I can do at this point? Thanks!  <comment271675> What version of OS X are you running and how are you trying to create the DMG file, by Disk Utility or in a Terminal using `hdiutil`? <comment271804> It is by disk utility and the version is yosemite. thank you!
