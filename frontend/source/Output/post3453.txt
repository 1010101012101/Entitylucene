Display pressed shortcuts as an overlay on the screen <body> On this great Ruby on Rails screencast, every time a shortcut combination is pressed it shows up on top of the screen, and it shows up so often that I find it hard to believe it was placed by hand when editing the movie. Is there any application that does this?  <answer3463> Not sure which specific screencast you're speaking of, but they may be using Keycastr.  <answer3464> For the sake of completeness: Boinx Software's Mousepos√© does this (and a lot more) as well ($17).   <comment3150> Actually, I'm sorry, it wasn't a Textmate screencast, it was the "Ruby on Rails 15 Minute Blog" screencast.  It's this program, no doubt! Thanks a lot, I had searched this before to no avail.
