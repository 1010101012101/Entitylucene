GPU Panic: OS X 10.11, El Capitan stability issues and spontaneous restarts <body> I am facing severe stability issues after doing a clean install of OS X 10.11, El Capitan, on my MacBook Pro (Mid 2010).  It restarts spontaneously for no apparent reason. Sometimes it subsequently reports a kernel panic, while other times not. Also it seems to affect the battery, such that the maximum charge varies before and after a crash, e.g. just now it was 105% before and 63% after.  Before the clean install a brand new original battery and a new SSD (Crucial CT250MX200SSD1) was installed.  I did try an SMC reset, but with no effect.  I have no idea what is going on. Any similar experiences or ideas?  h3Hardware/h3  ul liMacBookPro6,2, 15-inch, Mid 2010/li li2,66 GHz Intel Core i7/li li8 GB 1067 MHz DDR3/li /ul  h3Kernel Panic/h3  precodeAnonymous UUID:

It resolved my problem on El Capitan.  This issue is caused when your Mac is transitioning from the integrated GPU to the second, discrete GPU. I have the same Mac configuration, and it restarts when I open high-resolution apps like Photos, HD videos on YouTube, and sometimes Launchpad.  I also recommend you download gfxCardStatus to see when your apps are switching GPUs (should you choose not to disable automatic graphics switching).  <answer215816> I hope that someone gives you a precise answer like update your duet software or unplug this specific piece of hardware, but you may have to do the manual troubleshooting labor and record each instance of the panic in order to narrow down what's causing it.  That process is extremely easy but a little time-consuming:  ol liMake sure your data is backed up  at intervals that makes sense for you. /li liHow serious are occasional kernel panics? /li /ol  You can then ignore occasional kernel panics and be meticulous about troubleshooting ones that are repeatable. Keep in mind, how repeatable a panic is can be hard to estimate until you have 10 or more instances and can look back over specific logs and circumstances. These logs also make it far easier to decide whether to repair hardware or focus on software repair and configuration.   <answer216201> I have the exact same configuration - and the same GPU panic - the only difference being the addresses.  My 8-Gig of RAM is from Crucial and has worked flawlessly for 3 years.  I have been troubleshooting for several weeks and I can almost "cause" the panic to occur.  Note:  I get the same panic whether upgrading to El Capitan - or after a clean install.  Multiple SMC / NVRAM resets have made no difference.  I can't say yet whether unchecking the automatic graphics switching option makes any difference.  It is also the same whether running on battery or AC power.  Here are my observations so far.  ol liWhen the GPU panic occurs - the Mac Mail app is open with mail and side bar fully displayed or partially obscured behind another window.  Safari has typically been open as well./li liThe GPU panic occurs shortly after wake from sleep when the trackpad or mouse is used to scroll through mail messages./li liI made it 13 days without the panic (but I also never opened the mail app during that time - since this is not my primary Mac - I was able to avoid using Mail).  Safari was open during this entire time.  All other activities were my typical daily activities.  As soon as I opened Mail - and allowed the Mac to go to sleep - within 10 seconds of waking from sleep and scrolling the list of emails - the panic occurs./li liIt seems that the Mac also has to be sleeping for a certain period of time before the panic will occur.  It is not necessarily possible to cause the panic to occur by intentionally telling the Mac to sleep - and then waking it shortly after.  If left in sleep for 20 minutes or longer - the panic is more likely to occur./li liI will continue to troubleshoot - with "only" the mail app open - and also with sleep set to "never"./li /ol  <answer216240> There was a quality program for 2010 15" MacBook pros where the graphics card would fail in a mode very similar to what you are seeing. If you go to an Apple Store, if your model is one of the affected ones, they have a special diagnostic to test specifically for the issue.  That being said, since it's about 5 years old now, it might be vintage and no longer qualify for a quality program or any repair for that matter. But at least you'll know if your problem is hardware or software. (Apple doesn't charge for the appointment or running a diagnostic)  <answer217169> I went to the Genius Bar after the same kernel panics (posted above) and spontaneous crash/restarts (after the 10.11 upgrade). I knew the mid-2010 MacBook Pro had a graphics chip problem before I went, however it was never a problem. They did the diagnostic and (sure enough) Apple Techs said I needed a new logic board (where the graphics chip mounts). I said that it only became a problem with the El Capitan upgrade. Circular logic prevailed in our discussion - a sort of chicken and egg philosophical debate.  The tech (who shall remain unnamed) said "Look, just downgrade your OS to the previous version and it will be fine." So, I did. And, it's now working fine (no more crashes) with the older, but more reliable, OS 10.6.8  This was a really lousy Mac experience. However, the fix was as easy as a few drag and drops to a spare drive and a Time Machine session.  <answer217920> I have the same MBPconfiguration and have been having the same GPU crashes but far more frequently - every 10 minutes in xcode.  I did download the gfxcardstatus tool and set it to internal display only and have now been running for about 45 minutes with no crashes ... so this may not be a complete test but it does seem better. FWIW ...   <answer223154> Have a 2010 MacBook Pro. Upgrade to Yosemite. It slowed down so I upgraded to El Capitan. It got worse. Took it in for diagnostics and it failed on video main logic card..?   They took it for about a week to fix it. I am really nervous about them messing it up even more. It will cost $310.00. It was working fine before the upgrade. I had to upgrade because they said it was not compatible with my I-phone 5S.  So long story short, this appears to be something that can be fixed for a flat rate repair. Less than $350 for parts, labor and shipping. Really disappointed with Mac as I hoped to not need to pay for a repair so soon.  <answer245015> I am getting similar problems on a mid-2012 retina mbpro with el capitan.   It only started happening yesterday but many times since.   Whenever it has occurred, the computer has been running seriously hot. I am not using smcFanControl at high intensity and monitoring the temperatures with Temperature Gauge to see if it happens at low temperatures as well. But it may be a problem that's provoked by intense GPU usage.   Another clue mentioned here is that (apart from hardware problems) it might have to do with which kernel extensions are loaded: https://origin-discussions-us.apple.com/thread/7592234  Here is my kernel panic log: http://pastebin.com/hci9xBKW  Edit: perhaps using really GPU intensive things like going back and forth in youtube videos can stress it and potentially provoke it for testing purposes...  <comment255759> Please can you edit your question and add some of the kernel panic log file. You can find the file using **Applications  Utilities  Console.app** then look under **System Diagnostic Reports**. <comment255817> I just looked and this option is already unchecked <comment255916> I just added the newest kernel panic report. I hope someone has an idea as to what is going on. It is quite difficult to use a laptop, which spontaneously restarts every hour or so <comment255929> According to this [link](http://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gpu-kernel-panic-in-mid-2010-whats-the-best-fix.1890097/) the GPU Kernel Panic in mid-2010 macbook pros is a known issue. The strange part is, that it has not been a problem on Mavericks. It only started occurring after I clean installed El Capitan. <comment255997> Update: I called Apple support earlier today. They led me through doing a SMC reset and a NVRAM reset. Also OS X El Capitan 10.11 was re-installed. I just had another crash so still the issue is not resolved. I will call them again tomorrow. <comment256005> I found this [link](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203554) according to which it does not look like any solution other than expensive hardware replacement exists: "MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) intermittent black screen or loss of video Quality Program has ended The eligibility period for the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2010) intermittent black screen or loss of video Quality Program has ended." :-( <comment256195> Update: Since installing 10.11.1 this morning, I have had no GPU kernel panics. As the issue is related to a hardware failure on the Nvidia discrete graphics chip, I am not quite sure if I am out of the woods just yet with a mere software update. I will keep you and any future readers posted. <comment257259> This also happens not only during video switching. <comment257268> LeonDK, let me know please if your GPU kernel panics completely disappeared after updating El Capitan. <comment259540> @SmailK No unfortunately, they started after I installed El Capitan. I have found NO solution so far. As I understand it, the issue is that El Capitan require more graphic ressources, hence the frequency of the issue. <comment259541> Update: No solution so far. My MBP is still unstable. I have talked extensively with Apple support and they have now referred me to an official Apple retailer to ask for a repair. <comment260254> I have the same configuration which causes the GPU panic as well. No solution found so far, just wanted to mention there is an other case. <comment260662> Update: My MBP has now been checked by an authorised apple service provider end the logic board needs to be replaced. Price 800 euros. I'm not going to spend that much money on a 5 year old laptop. Next step is to call Apple support and see if they are willing to cover the repair. I doubt it though... <comment261229> Update: I have confirmed that GPU Panic occurs regardless of the Automatic Graphics Switching setting. <comment261432> Update: Talked extensively with Apple support. They were quite friendly and all, but alas they cannot cover the 800 euro repair, that my local AASP charges. I will decline the repair and instead I plan to take the laptop to an electronics repair shop, where they possibly can refurbish the faulty connections between the logic board and the GPU, which is the physical cause of the kernel panics. <comment261562> Update: I have now determined that the GPU panic can be reliably re-produced by having the mail app open - but partially obscured behind another window - so that it does not have the focus - and then either put the Mac to sleep - or allow it to sleep on its own - for about 15 minutes or more.  Wake the Mac - can manipulate other windows and apps just fine - as soon as mail regains the focus - and I scroll up and down in the list of mails - the GPU panic occurs.  Taking to Apple Store this afternoon for hardware test.  I will submit a bug report if there is no indication of a hardware issue. <comment261592> Update:  Apple Store tested my Mid 2010 15" MacBook Pro.  On their advanced graphics part of the test it failed on the Metal API test (or so they said) - they showed me the failure.  Video board (on logic board) is failing.  The logic board needs to be replaced.  I'm questioning whether the video board has always had this problem - and the problem is now surfacing because El Capitan is using the Metal API.  If enough people bring in their Mid 2010 MacBook pro and this same failure occurs - maybe Apple will refund the logic board replacement cost.  No need to report a bug. <comment271839> $350 is much cheaper than the repair offer I received. They would charge ~€800, which is about $875 <comment299722> There is a similar quality program for later model MacBook Pros: http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ <comment302033> I've got about three Macs that otherwise were stable and started crashing badly with this GPU panic on 10.11 - I'll update back if I can get a stable build less than 10.11 and greater than 10.6.8 - perhaps it's something we can keep using the Macs for occasional use on legacy projects and legacy software rather than updating them to 10.11. <comment317968> For what it's worth, my 2011 15" MacBook Pro was long out of warranty, and when the graphics card failed I was prepared to pay several hundred dollars for the replacement card.  (I'd never heard of the quality program.)  But, surprise!  When I took it in for repairs I learned about the quality program and the repairs were done for free! <comment317969> **Important note:** The first Apple technician I talked to **did not know about the quality program** (or just didn't tell me—she seemed new, though).  After I took the computer home to make a backup (via "target disk mode" and CarbonCopyCloner) and brought it back for repairs, **the *second* tech I talked to told me about the quality program,** and that my repairs would be free.
