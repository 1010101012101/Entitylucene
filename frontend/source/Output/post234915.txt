iPhone vibrates on every Viber text message received <body> Even when my viber application is open on a specific discussion, it continues to vibrate on every received message part of the current discussion.  How can I turn off this very annoying feature for Viber discussions ?  or, if not possible,   How can I turn off the whole Viber notifications vibration ?  I currently use an iPhone 5  <answer234923> It's my understanding that you can't turn off specific vibration notifications in Viber; that's just how the application is built.  I've seen messages on the Apple discussion boards with people complaining about this from almost 3 years ago.  To turn off all notifications for Viber, go into codeSettings --&gt; Notifications --&gt; Viber/code.  Switch the codeAllow notifications/code to off.  This will disable all notifications for Viber at the iPhone level.  <answer253985> It looks like the feedback has been acted upon, and it is now possible to turn off vibrations and sounds while you are using the app already. A very welcome change indeed! (Not sure which version it was implemented in) You can do it by going to "More" tab on Viber, and opening Settings - Notifications, and turn off "In-App vibrations". See the official Viber documentation here. Excerpt:     strongIn-App Vibrate/strong      When this option is enabled, you will receive a vibration for every incoming notification.   <comment287238> Send feedback to the app maker... They choose it to work that way. <comment287241> Do you want to turn off vibration on Viber for every message or only when you're in a discussion? <comment287244> @fbara, I add a precision inside the question <comment316196> Because, well, thats what it does when it receives a notification on silent..
