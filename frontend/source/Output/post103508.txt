mac blue screen and computer freeze <body> I have a macbook pro, OS 10.8.5 In the past month or so, I have had problems where the computer will freeze, and then switch to a blue screen.  It's not 100% blue, but has some very slight vertical lines. I have to press the power button to reboot. Sometimes it takes a while to reboot properly.  In some instances, i have to reboot multiple times, b/c it won't boot all the way up.  I know that the next question people will ask is what causes it.  I don't know exactly. At first, i thought it was the latest update of virtualbox, since that has been a problem in the past, and my problems seemed to occur after the latest update of virtual box 4.2.18 and also while i was running virtualbox.  so i reinstalled an older version. that seemed to stabilize it some.  Then, it also was freezing seemingly when i was running timemachine. so i stopped that as well.br and the computer stabilized for while longer.  Today, i was opening powerpoint and my screen shifted to the right, meaning there was a "gutter" down the middle of my screen and the left side of my screen appeared on the right side of the screen, and then the right side wrapped to the left side. all while "shaking".  eventually, it froze and went blue.  anyone have any ideas on what may be happening, or what things i can try to diagnose?  thanks, Eddie.  More information. i was able to cause the crash by opening virtualbox. the time of the crash was 1:12 AM.  but there isn't anything apparent that would help during that timeframe in the console log.  or at least that makes any sense to me. pasted here below:  9/28/13 1:10:46.686 AM coreaudiod[285]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active 9/28/13 1:10:46.861 AM coreaudiod[285]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive 9/28/13 1:10:47.335 AM coreaudiod[285]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active 9/28/13 1:10:47.509 AM coreaudiod[285]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive 9/28/13 1:11:36.028 AM coreaudiod[285]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active 9/28/13 1:11:36.202 AM coreaudiod[285]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive 9/28/13 1:12:10.998 AM coreaudiod[285]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active 9/28/13 1:12:11.172 AM coreaudiod[285]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive 9/28/13 1:12:26.660 AM coreaudiod[285]: Disabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is active 9/28/13 1:12:26.835 AM coreaudiod[285]: Enabled automatic stack shots because audio IO is inactive 9/28/13 1:12:33.509 AM login[414]: DEAD_PROCESS: 414 ttys000 9/28/13 1:17:42.000 AM bootlog[0]: BOOT_TIME 1380345462 0  There was also another piece of information, i found in the log files. i couldn't pinpoint the time of the error, but this showed up around one of the instances.  not sure if this would help. it didn't seem to be a safari caused crash though, so not sure that this is the right information to be looking at:  Process:         PluginProcess [359] Path:            /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/WebKit2.framework/PluginProcess.app/Contents/MacOS/PluginProcess Identifier:      com.apple.WebKit.PluginProcess Version:         8536 (8536.30.1) Build Info:      WebKit2-7536030001000000~9 Code Type:       X86 (Native) Parent Process:  Safari [344] User ID:         501  PlugIn Path:       /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/googletalkbrowserplugin.plugin/Contents/MacOS/googletalkbrowserplugin PlugIn Identifier: com.google.googletalkbrowserplugin PlugIn Version:    4.6.3.15268 (4.6.3.15268)  Date/Time:       2013-09-28 00:47:00.049 -0400 OS Version:      Mac OS X 10.8.5 (12F37) Report Version:  10  Crashed Thread:  0  Dispatch queue: com.apple.main-thread  Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV) Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000087bc2ff0  VM Regions Near 0x87bc2ff0:     MALLOC_SMALL           000000007e000000-000000007e800000 [ 8192K] rw-/rwx SM=PRVbr --      __TEXT                 000000008fe75000-000000008fea8000 [  204K] r-x/rwx SM=COW  /usr/lib/dyld  <comment121812> To diagnose, look in Console log and at the time stamp of when it happened. You can publish it here so we might have a look as well. Please not all of it just some 10 lines before the event and 10 after :). Did you run the Apple Hardware test ? Hope your Graphics card is not failing?
