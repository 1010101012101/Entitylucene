Ceased to open old files by double-clicking on the Time Capsule disk <body> On the local drives (internal and external), everything is fine.   Any strongnewly/strong stored files on the Time Capsule open normally, but files that already existed no longer open when I double-click them.  Any idea how to fix it?  precode/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister -kill -f -r -v -domain local -domain system -domain user -domain network killall Finder /code/pre  Did not help.  <comment289815> If you open a Terminal, type `open`, drag a file that won't open into the terminal, and push "return", does the file open? <comment289823> @HawkenRives The files open in the "Open" and "Open in", files can not be opened by **double-clicking** <comment289835> Yes. I'm trying to figure out if it's a problem with the Finder, or a problem with something else on the system.
