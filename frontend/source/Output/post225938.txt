Notes script to access notes in specific folder? <body> I have tested this Notes export script (https://github.com/alexwlchan/notes-export/blob/master/notes-export.scpt). It seems to work, but the issue is that I want to specify a specific Notes folder to export, rather than every single one.   The issue is the main loop clause:  precoderepeat with theNote in notes /code/pre  "notes" is a Notes field that is a collection of all notes. However, I only want notes in a specific Notes directory. I have no problem specifying the Notes folder by name and having the script confirm that the folder actually exists. Unfortunately, I don't see this documented anywhere.  How do I, in AppleScript, get the list of notes in a specific Note folder? I also need to get the notes's path, since in some cases the Notes directories I am exporting in turn have sub-directories.  <answer225939> Try:  precodetell application "Notes"     set myFolder to first folder whose name = "FolderA"     set myNotes to notes of myFolder     repeat with theNote in myNotes         -- insert your code here     end repeat end tell /code/pre  <comment274272> Can you please add some explanations documenting the actions the code performs? <comment274294> AppleScript reads like pseudo script anyway but... this script processes the notes within a folder named "FolderA". If the user replaces "FolderA" with the name of the directory he/she wants to use, it will process each note assigned to the theNote variable. <comment274324> Thanks. I also want to preserve the directory structure when I export notes from "FolderA", which has subdirectories. Is it possible to also get the path of each note inside of "FolderA"?
