Using Screen Sharing app, all remote Mac screens appear pixellated <body> I've got a couple of Macs that I regularly screen share to using the build-in Screen Sharing app:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bkdWo.png" width="100"  A month or two ago, both started looking very pixellated when viewed â€” text is very difficult to read.  Here's an example:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXzyW.png" width="120"  My first thought was that this was related to Screen Sharing's scaling or quality settings, but I've tried all combinations of both to no avail.  I shrugged it off as a broken update or something, and didn't think anything of it.   Until I screen shared from a emdifferent/em Mac, and both of the remote Macs looked great again:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xQOIc.png" width="110"  The problem source Mac specs:  precodemacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67) MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013) NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M 1024 MB Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB Screen Sharing v1.7.1 (494.15) /code/pre  The working source Mac specs:  precodemacOS Sierra 10.12.2 (16C67) Mac mini (Mid 2011) Intel HD Graphics 3000 Screen Sharing v1.7.1 (494.15) /code/pre  Any idea what's going on here? How do I make screen sharing great again?  <comment337786> This is a yuge problem! I'm not quite sure what Screen Sharing is, are you talking about the Microsoft or Google products for it or [this Apple thing](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18696?locale=en_US)? <comment337787> Screen Sharing is an app built into macOS. <comment337788> Are both machines on the same network. Or better asked are they using the same speed. Because lower speed means pixelated screen sharing. <comment337804> Screen Sharing, the built-in Mac app. And yes both machines are on the same network connected. MacBook with 802.11ac, the Mini with a cat5e cable.
