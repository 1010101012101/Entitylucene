Mission Control behaving differently with monitor plugged in <body> On OSX 10.9 (maybe other versions, too), I've noticed that the icons for the different spaces in Mission Control behave differently whether or not I have a monitor plugged in.  With a monitor plugged in, the label is always there and there is no magnification effect on hover.  Without a monitor, the labels are only there on hover and there's a magnification effect reminiscent of the dock.  Do you know if there's a way to make it always act like it does when there's a monitor plugged in?  <answer113729> This is due to the differing amount of spaces shown in Mission Control, and both situations can be re-created with independently of the quantity of displays.  hr  When you have a small number of spaces, it shows like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2AuWE.jpg" alt="4 Spaces"  When you have lots of spaces, it shows like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DkaxV.jpg" alt="8 Spaces"  This is not due to the number of displays you have connected but rather simply the number of spaces you have open.  To recreateâ€¦  ul liYou can make it act like the first example by having a small number of spaces, and it will use the default size and show the name of the space./li liYou can make it act like the second example by having a lot of open spaces, and it will reduce the size of the space thumbnails to fit them on, and hide the space name if necessary./li /ul
