Mac is not remembering specific network <body> I keep the option to auto-join preferred networks on wake.  However, after I reconfigured my router at home, my home network simply ignores that option.  I have already tried fixing HD permissions on Disc Utility. Didn't work. What else can I do?  P.S.: The config is still working at work.  <answer85255> I've had the same thing happen to me.  Just create a new location with appropriate preferred settings and have that one connect.  You can delete the old one if necessary.  <comment98587> Thank you for your answer but didn't work here. I am thinking the problem is with my router then. I will reconfiguring it again.
