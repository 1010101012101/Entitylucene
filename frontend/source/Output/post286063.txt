Mac book pro 9,2 Reverting Partitioning/triple boot Help <body> MacBookPro9,2 running Mavericks OSX 10.9.2 Mid 2012  I am trying to revert the triple boot and partitioning that I performed on my macbook pro a few years ago to bring hard drive space back to the main OSX.  Forgot a lot of how I did it.  It was originally Mac HD dual-booted Windows 7 through bootcamp and then used refit/refind to add linux gentoo over the top with gparted for triple-boot. I’ve deleted the gentoo partition through Disk Utility and now I can’t figure out how to use that space.  Resizing the mac HD partition won’t work it keeps reverting back to the grey area which was originally made by gentoo.  Trying to delete the bootcamp windows partition as well and bring all the space back to my main Mac HD, how can I do that?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTHZb.png" alt="HD via Disk Utility"  Want to avoid reinstalling mac os at all costs.
