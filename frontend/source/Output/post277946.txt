I upgraded my 5GB iCloud storage to 50GB storage and its not showing <body> and not only is it not showing but 1.98€ was deducted from my account and not 99¢ as advertised.  I am loath to click again as they may deduct MORE money!? Anyone out there know why my iCloud storage isn't appearing?  <answer277956> Try rebooting your devices. That usually updates the display of available iCloud storage.  As for the extra charge, are you sure it's not just a temporary hold? If it still shows 2€ in a few days you might want it call Apple support directly and have it sorted out.  <answer277962> The easy way to make sure Apple has provisioned your storage is to sign in to iCloud on a computer with a somewhat modern browser:  https://www.icloud.com/#settings  If the cloud doesn't see your storage, you have a billing and/or support question.  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/itunes/li /ul  If the cloud does show your storage, you can get free support using the paid storage as an exception from AppleCare at:  ul lihttps://support.apple.com/ - choose your device that's not able to get the paid storage./li /ul  <answer278556> Block all share items and modify apps and share alike  <comment349800> Yes, just tried rebooting, nothing!  Exactly the same........ <comment349807> Thank you, yes I signed into iCloud on my laptop and it is not showing.  I will contact them through the link you have sent! <comment349808> @JoannePaterson Good luck. If you have a computer, there's also the "report a problem" link with each purchase. Also the email receipt you get might have a support link. I use the one above, so it should get you to billing support rapidly. <comment350548> Welcome to Ask Different, and thanks for your contribution! I must admit that I don’t really understand what you are trying to say, even though I have owned iPhones for almost a decade.   Would you mind elaborating your answer a bit? For example, you could try using complete sentences, and state exactly what sequence of menu items to tap, and how they are labelled. Thanks a lot – happy to have you here!
