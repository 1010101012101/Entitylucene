Sort folders first, then files [El Capitan] <body> I am aware there are many posts about this problem, but many are just workarounds for Finder. However I use console more often then Finder because of programming.   I am also aware of something like this (after getting coreutils):  codealias ll='gls -la -h --group-directories-first'/code  But thats just another 'plugin' or external utility, which does the job well but doesn't answer my question.   I also found out that Dropbox web also sorts your files according to the User Agent. If it is changed from the Develop menu in Safari to IE or Firefox/Chrome (Widows) then it sorts folders first.  I get that OS X and Windows must be rebels so they use different sorting but frankly it's a mess when you got plenty files and they all get mixed up.   Does OS X have a system wide setting for this so when I type codels -la/code output is sorted folders first then files and both are alphabetically ascending (a to z)? Or is the sorting mechanism related to the implementation of program/application which is displaying files?  <answer224833> I think the simple answer is no, if the question is whether the native codels/code command can be configured to list directories before it lists non-directories. One of the comments suggests a shell pipeline, but rather than going to that trouble it might be easier to write a script.  The following python code is by no means intended to be a complete substitute for the codels/code command, but complicating it to handle more of what codels/code provides feels doable (python's codeargparse/code module would help with that).  precode#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                                                                      import os import sys  for top in sys.argv[1:]:     for (name, dirs, files) in os.walk(top):         print("{}:".format(name))         for dir in dirs:             print("{}/".format(dir))         for file in files:             print(file) /code/pre  What makes the separation of directories from non-directories easy in this example is that python's codeos.walk/code does that for me, in its return value. The use of codeos.walk/code implicitly imposes the equivalent of codels -R/code, but that should be easy to fix by adapting code from codeos.walk/code, which is native python code built on top of codeos.listdir/code and codeos.path.isdir/code, rather than invoking codeos.walk/code directly.  With respect to the question of native capabilities versus external utilities, python is native to recent releases of codeMacOS/code. Where scripting like this ranks compared to pulling in external functionality is a matter of taste.  There might be an invocation of codefind/code which fits your criteria, similar to the codels/code pipeline in a comment, using the code-type/code option in multiple invocations of codefind/code, but to me that feels clumsy compared to python code.  <comment271589> Welcome to Ask Different. I've tried to put a clear question at the end of the post. Ca you edit this if I somehow missed your main point? <comment271593> All good. Thanks <comment271607> Does `alias ls='ls -laO | grep "^d" && ls -laO | grep "^-" && ls -laO | grep "^l"'` meet your requirements in Terminal? <comment271636> No, it does not.
