iOS App Icon Stretched <body> I recently noticed that in iOS 7 my app icon stretches:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RbfMD.jpg" alt=""  And here is how it is supposed to be:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TcPxo.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  This is only in iOS 7. What should I do? Should I contact Apple?  <answer105809>    If you want to target only iOS 7, you just need 76 x 76, 120 x 120 and 152 x 152 icon sizes.   If you want to target also iOS 6, you’ll need 57 x 57, 72 x 72, 76 x 76, 114 x 114, 120 x   120, 144 x 144 and 152 x 152 icon sizes. Without counting Spotlight and Settings icon if   you don’t want the OS to interpolate them!   If you change the resolution of the app icons the problem should be fixed.
