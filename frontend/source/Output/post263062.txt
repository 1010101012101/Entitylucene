Identity File not working <body> Here's what's going on: I have a DSA ssh-key set up on my MacBook Pro, and the codeid_dsa.pub/code file has been placed in code~/.ssh/authorized_keys/code. Permissions are 600 for codeid_dsa/code.  I'm still being asked for my password, what do I do?  I've included output from level 1 debugging below, which I believe should have sufficient information to identify the problem. If not let me know and I will provide level 3.  precodeDaniels-MacBook-Pro:.ssh dsmith$ ssh -v km4ayu.com OpenSSH_7.2p2, LibreSSL 2.4.1 debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/dsmith/.ssh/config debug1: /Users/dsmith/.ssh/config line 1: Applying options for km4ayu.com debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to km4ayu.com [104.168.167.30] port 17785. debug1: Connection established. debug1: identity file /Users/dsmith/.ssh/id_dsa type 2 debug1: key_load_public: No such file or directory debug1: identity file /Users/dsmith/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 debug1: Enabling compatibility mode for protocol 2.0 debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2 debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 debug1: match: OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 pat OpenSSH_6.6.1* compat 0x04000000 debug1: Authenticating to km4ayu.com:17785 as 'kv4lq' debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT sent debug1: SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received debug1: kex: algorithm: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org debug1: kex: host key algorithm: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 debug1: kex: server-&gt;client cipher: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com MAC: &lt;implicit&gt; compression: none debug1: kex: client-&gt;server cipher: chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com MAC: &lt;implicit&gt; compression: none debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_KEX_ECDH_REPLY debug1: Server host key: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 SHA256:/214EQvH59cIt2nCaT+XhRruKws4j7Jwo3anBGMGO6g debug1: Host '[km4ayu.com]:17785' is known and matches the ECDSA host key. debug1: Found key in /Users/dsmith/.ssh/known_hosts:1 debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS debug1: rekey after 134217728 blocks debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received debug1: Skipping ssh-dss key /Users/dsmith/.ssh/id_dsa - not in PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: password kv4lq@km4ayu.com's password:  /code/pre  <answer263063> The new openssh version (7.0+) strongdeprecated DSA keys/strong and is not using DSA keys by default (not on server or client). The keys are not preferred to be used anymore, so if you can, I would recommend to stronguse RSA keys/strong where possible.  If you really need to use DSA keys, you need to explicitly allow them in your client config using  precodePubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss /code/pre  Should be enough to put that line in code~/.ssh/config/code, as the verbose message is trying to tell you.
