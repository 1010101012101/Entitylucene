How do I change the owner name on my MacBook Pro? <body> When I use Terminal my computer says  precodeLast login: Thu Jun  7 22:00:00 on ttys000 John-Does-MacBook-Pro:~ John$  /code/pre  That was the default account name on the computer when I bought it. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I am pretty much set with the OS and I really don't want to do a reinstall. I deleted the John Doe account but that did nothing.  How do I change my Terminal so it doesn't display that any more?  <answer53174> In System Preferences, go to Sharing and change the name at the top of the window.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0gH6n.jpg" alt="System Prefs&gt;Sharing&gt;Computer name"  <answer88773> Create a new "USER" --  named as you wish.  Move the entire contents of your current  User Folder to the new folder via Drag &amp; Drop.  If you hold down the strongCommand Key/strong during  the operation, selected items will be MOVED,  as opposed to copied, aliased, etc.  Reboot while holding down the Option Key.  Voila !  <comment60783> Perfect mate. For future viewers, quit terminal and then start it again to see the change. <comment104076> I think Davisgeek's answer is a bit more practical.
