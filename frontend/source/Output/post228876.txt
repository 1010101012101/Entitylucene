Can MBP 13 mid 2012 send audio and video through thunderbolt to HDMI? <body> I own this model: https://support.apple.com/kb/sp649?locale=en_US  And I have an adapter thunderbolt to HDMI that works wonderfully with video, but no audio.   Does someone has any advice on a product or the info about the capabilites of my mac to send audio AND video through thunderbolt port?  <answer228880> As far as I know, thunderbolt to HDMI by default provides audio.  Now, whether your adapter supports it, well that's another question.  I have used this device from Amazon Basics to supply HDMI to a TV (including audio) from a MBP and a Microsoft Surface Pro 3.  It worked with zero issues.  <answer228886> We've switched from HDMI cables and dongles to Cable Matters HDMI &lt; Mini DisplayPort cables, as found on Amazon. They come in different lengths and colors.  In actuality, you are not connecting with Thunderbolt - the Thunderbolt port is used as a Mini DisplayPort connector.  <comment279131> What adapter are you using?  Can you provide a link to exactly which one you purchased?  I suspect the problem is your adapter doesn't support audio even though your computer does.
