mac os x - UNIX domain sockets in abstract namespace <body> Are they possible?  According to this it is possible starting from Mac osx 10.9. Ctrl + F for "New support for Abstract namespace sockets" on that page. But I was not able to find one single example for Mac.  Also in Linux the sockets created in the abstract name space you can see them in /proc/net/unix (cat -v /proc/net/unix). The mac does not have /proc/...  Where can I expect to find them? Does it have something similar to Linux?  Thanks.  <answer157509> The developer documentation linked is for codeperl/code, not Mac OS X. The documentation states that strongperl v5.11.0/strong is capable of supporting abstract socket namespaces.  The undocumented assumption is that the underlying operating system also provides this support.  I am not aware of any Apple documentation saying Mac OS X supports abstract namespace sockets.  <comment185206> Mac OS X 10.9 included `perl` as a component. I presume these manual pages are installed in the appropriate system `man` file location and were then picked up by Apple's man page to web page tools.
