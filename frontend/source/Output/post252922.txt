Access hidden account from login screen <body> After I set a blank password to my admin account, My account icon was removed from login screen and I'm completely locked out of my Mac. Any ideas?  <answer252928> Do you have auto-login enabled for this user? If so you can probably reboot and get back in.  If you see the 'Other' user at the Login Window you can use that, too.  If all else fails you try ssh'ing in from another system (codessh user@computer.local/code) or booting up in single user mode (codeCommand-S/code on startup).
