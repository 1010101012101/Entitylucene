Open Finder Tabs with Automator? <body> I'd like to say that the problem I want to solve is pretty simple, but I can't seem to find any good resources to tackle it.  I'd like to have an Automator application that will open all of my SMB/network shares (these are constant, but are sometimes not mounted) in a single window in multiple tabs. I can't seem to find any way to do it because Automator doesn't seem to address Finder tabs at all.  Any thoughts?  <answer132859> You can use an AppleScript:  precodeon run     tell application "System Events"         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "~/Documents"         key code 36         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "~/Applications"         key code 36     end tell end run /code/pre  Simply repeat lines code06/code to code10/code for any number of locations you want to open in tabs. Save and import into Automator.  It does take a little while to run, but it works.   strongExplanation:/strong Uses the "Goto" pane to open a location, then presses enter (codekey code 36/code). The program then opens a new tab and repeats the process.  <answer132912> This is what I ended up doing, with help from BritishColour. I ended up adjusting the delays because the Cmd + G was being a little quirky and not registering the key code 36 (enter) command. This also calls up Finder so it doesn't activate in whatever program I might be using in the moment.  precodeon run      tell application "Finder" to activate      tell application "System Events"         keystroke "n" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX2"         delay 2         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX3"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX4"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX5"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX6"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1         keystroke "t" using {command down}         keystroke "g" using {command down, shift down}         keystroke "/Volumes/XXXX7"         delay 1         key code 36         delay 1     end tell end run /code/pre  <comment157305> would this work for you http://superuser.com/a/455932 <comment157318> You could try doing it on a keystroke bases (just like a Macro), it would take a while but definitely work. It would be pretty easy to implement with an `AppleScript` <comment157357> It's ugly that this is more or less the only way to handle this. Maybe the new OS will have better support for this. Regardless, thanks, this should allow me to write the specific one I need. <comment157440> @ezgoodnight yeah it sucks. I'm running 10.10 at the moment and it doesn't seem like theres any luck there either...
