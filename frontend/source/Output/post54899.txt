Precise search inside a pdf <body> I wanted to search inside a PDF with Adobe Acrobat Reader for MacOS (or the one built in with MacOS). I want to search, for example, for the emcapital/em letter "U".  Is it possible and, if yes, how?  <answer54900> A tutorial online here for Adobe Acrobat Reader indicates in step 4 how to do a emcase-sensitive/em search, which is what you're looking for.  Press codeCtrl-F/code to start a search in Adobe Acrobat Reader. Enter the letter codeU/code and then tick (select) the check-box next to "Case-Sensitive" search. Press the codeSearch/code button to start the search.  <comment62935> Answers on Ask Different need to be more than just a link. It's okay to include a link, but please summarize or excerpt it in the answer. The idea is to make the answer stand alone. <comment62949> Adobe Reader.. yuck :( Unless you need to edit pdf files, you should check out Skim: http://skim-app.sourceforge.net
