Move or transfer only all the Screenshots from iPhone iOS 9.x to Windows PC? <body> These few links/ answers do not satisfy my question because strongScreenshots folder was introduced only in iOS 9.x/strong as per:   http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8914505/apple-ios-9-beta-photos-screenshots  strongAlso, I found a lot of tutorials/ sites that talk about How to Delete all Screenshots - But I'd like to Copy/ Move them before Delete./strong   The simplest way to transfer photos from an iPhone to PC selectively (not sync-all)  Transferring photos from iPhone to windows computer  I do not wish for other pictures to go at the moment, just tons and tons of Screen shots that I've taken over the last 2 years.   They are taking up a lot of Phone space and I want them "moved/ transferred" to the Hard Drive on my Windows PC i.e. they are deleted from the Phone disk/ memory after safely Moving/ Transfering.   ul li"strongNOT all pictures/strong" and strongnot having to choose pictures individually/strong  /li liBut entire collection of strongALL SCREENSHOTS/ Pictures/strong in the strongScreenshots folder/strong that are on my iPhone as a Folder or Collection to my Windows PC.  /li /ul  How?

Maybe something does, but cant find a verifiable solution as yet. Can you check on the PB app that you have? <comment293880> With Pushbullet, you can select all the photos in your Screenshots folder on your iPhone, tap the share button, and go to Pushbullet (once you have it setup) and you can easily send those screenshots to your PC. <comment294004> @JohnRamos Does this transfer over USB or WiFi? Reliable? Hope it does not use Internet data/ cloud as I've limited data from ISP/ data cap / FUP <comment294203> Pushbullet transfers over Wifi, and I've found it pretty reliable. Not sure if you'll be able to do your tranafer over USB in any other method given how poorly PCs and iPhones talk to each other.
