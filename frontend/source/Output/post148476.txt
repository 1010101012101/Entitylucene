Is there a way to show the iPhone skin with the lastest iOS 8 Simulator? <body> Previous versions of the iOS Simulator (7 and below) would also show the iPhone skin, which made for better demos:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f94vt.png" alt="enter image description here"  Is there a way to do this with the iOS 8 Simulator? This isn't as compelling:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JEW16.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer148747> No, it's no longer possible. The recommended way for making demos is now using Quicktime in OS X Yosemite recorded directly from the device. If you wanted you could take that video and during post-production use one of the App Store Marketing Templates to make it look a little nicer.  <comment175154> Do you run a Retina Macbook Pro or a 4K Monitor? <comment175181> Yes, I run a 15" Retina Macbook Pro <comment175184> I should have clarified live screen-sharing demos, but this answers the direct question, though a disappointing change. Thanks. <comment175640> For what it's worth, there's Loren Brichter's [SimFinger](https://github.com/atebits/SimFinger) ([more info](http://web.archive.org/web/20111207183520/http://blog.atebits.com/2009/03/not-your-average-iphone-screencast)), but I won't post that as an answer because it doesn't currently have iPhone 6 or 6 Plus graphics. <comment175710> Thanks @kirb! That might be a decent workaround.
