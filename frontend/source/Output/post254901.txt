Why can't I open the Creative Cloud folder in terminal <body> I am new to the terminal but find the ability to navigate folders quite handy, so I wanted to cd into the Creative Cloud Files folder but for some reason it doesn't seem to be working do you know what may be the cause here?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zLw6p.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer254903> To access the folder emCreative Cloud Files/em you have to escape spaces in the folder name:  precodecd Creative\ Cloud\ Files /code/pre  or use quotation marks:  precodecd "Creative Cloud Files" /code/pre  You can also use the tab key after entering the first letters which will then auto-expand the folder name if the entered string is unique in the directory:  codecd Cre/code kbdtab/kbd which will expand to codecd Creative\ Cloud\ Files//codethen.  If the same directory also contains a folder e.g. emCredentials/em you have to enter an additional character (which makes the string unique) to get an auto-completed folder name.
