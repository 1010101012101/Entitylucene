Is there a way to create a notification in the Notification Center with a clickable link? <body> I can create a notification in Applescript via  codedisplay notification "Notification Text" with title "Title goes here" subtitle "subtitle goes here/code  However is there a way when I click on the notification it will take me to a url?  I tried setting the notification text to something like "https://apple.stackexchange.com/" however that didn't work.  <answer126511> What you ask isn't possible with bare AppleScript.   There are 2 possibilites I'm aware off :   ul liUsing Terminal Notifier : A CLI binary which will allow you to create notifications/li liUsing Notification scripting : A .app which can be called with AppleScript to create notifications. /li /ul  <comment148218> I might try wraping the url in an `a` tag next <comment148222> Nope it won't work, it doesn't interpret HTML.
