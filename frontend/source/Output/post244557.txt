Screenshot to OCR on OS X? <body> I want to be able to take a screenshot on my mac, then send that to an OCR engine and get back the text it has identified.   Are there any existing software tools that do this for OS X?  I have a Windows solution but not one for Mac.  <answer263686> I do it with LEADTOOLS OCR. Haven't used it much. Easy to use. Just used it on a smaller image... a screenshot of a book with both pages in the shot... this made the text smaller, contributing to errors.  Not sure if it's still available. The copyright on LEADTOOLS OCR is 1991-2014, and it is Version 2.  Good luck!  <answer281855> I recently purchased Condense ($5 appstore), which does exactly what you describe.
