Possible to Reinstall Bento <body> I recently had to wipe clean my harddrive. I had a Bento DB installed and so I had to reinstall it. I have the original license key, however, since FileMaker no longer supports Bento it isn't working. Any ideas on how I might be able to open my database?  <answer205056> Check the "archived software downloads"-section on their homepage here. There is a section for Bento v1, 2, 3 or 4, your product should be included as well. For example, try downloading Bento v4.1.2 from here ;)  <comment247230> How did you access your Bento DB *before* the wipe? Can you get the application you used back from your backup?
