How to recover photos deleted permanently from iPhone 5S? <body> I deleted some photos from my iPhone 5S to free some space on the phone, thinking that the same photos would be saved in iCloud or go to the recently deleted folder after deleted, but now I realise that for whatever reason my phone wasn't synced with iCloud and those photos were not saved in iCloud, or in my recently deleted folder.  Is there any way to recover those photos from the phone hard drive?  <comment331098> Have you synced the phone with your computer? <comment331675> But the other photos are missing? <comment331677> After I realise the photos disappeared I turn off iCloud sync and I called apple support for help, they guided through iTunes to backup the photos left on the phone, and after that I used a software called PhoneRescue to try to recover the deleted photos, but it only found the photos that I can already see on the phone. I Haven't try to sync the phone to iCloud since as I don't want to update my iCloud and delete more photos or make things worse. <comment331678> There is a better alternative to iCloud photos called Google Photos. I have found Google Photos to be much more reliable. You can install it from the app store. <comment331679> No the other photos are not missing, according to apple support it looks like at some point the phone stop syncing with iCloud. <comment331681> Was your phone connected to Wifi? It could be that iCloud photo syncing was disabled for cellular data which would mean the upload would only occur over wifi. It would be easier to help you if you presented all the settings. <comment331685> I think your only hope is if the photos were backed up and you aren't aware of it. You have already tried to recover data. Data recovery is very sketchy. I've never had to do it but I've heard you need to perform it before the sectors on the disk are rewritten. iPhones and all mobile devices use SSD (solid state). Their storage disks are non-mechanical which means the data may be irrecoverable. I'm not sure about how to recover data on mobile phones but if you have already tried data recovery with no results, you probably won't be able to recover the lost photos. <comment331687> You can access your iCloud photo library from https://www.icloud.com/#photos . I suggest checking to make sure your photos were indeed never backed up. The only thing I think you can do is setup a system to prevent this from happening again. I long ago ditched iCloud photos in favor of Google Photos which I find to be much more reliable and simple to use. <comment331690> The problem could also be that you changed your apple id password and you never updated the phone with the new password. However, I would imagine that your phone would have prompted you to enter the new password. <comment331691> Did you configure iCloud backup? https://support.apple.com/kb/ph12521?locale=en_US
