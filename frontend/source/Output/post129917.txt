Is it possible to submit not sandboxed app to the Mac App Store <body> I have an AppleScript Cocoa application that does a lot of shell scripts like codekill/code or codechflags/code. Is there any way I can try to send it on review to MAS and get it approved?  According to Wikipedia:     Disallowed types of applications revealed by Apple include new apps   that are not sandboxed (as of June 1, 2012). At WWDC 2013, Apple   announced that this rule no longer applied, and that so-called   "temporary exceptions" may be used when the app has a reason not to be   sandboxed.   However, Apple OS X Developer website states that sandboxing is required for Mac App Store.  <answer129920> According to this it is possible but with caveat.  App Sandbox Temporary Exception Entitlements     Note: This chapter describes property list keys specific to the OS X   implementation of App Sandbox. They are not available in iOS.      A temporary exception entitlement permits your OS X app to perform   certain operations otherwise disallowed by App Sandbox.      If you need to request a temporary exception entitlement, use Apple’s   bug reporting system to let Apple know what’s not working for you.   Apple considers feature requests as it develops the OS X platform.      Note: If you request a temporary-exception entitlement, be sure to   follow the guidance regarding entitlements provided on the iTunes   Connect website. In particular, use the Review Notes field in iTunes   Connect to explain why your app needs the exception, and include the   bug number.      To request a temporary exception entitlement for a target in an OS X   Xcode project, add it to the target’s .entitlements property list file   using the Xcode property list editor.
