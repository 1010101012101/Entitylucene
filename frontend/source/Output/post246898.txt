Force finder to "refresh" an icon <body> Sometimes, newly-copied apps (though a bash script) end up retaining the "circle with strike-through" on top of their icon, even after running them. Restarting the system fixes this issue.   Is there any way to trigger a "refresh" of said icon, preferable emexclusively/em, from the CLI? Since this is supposed to run on other systems than mine, I don't feel comfortable deleting the icon cache.  Asking in the context of OS X 10.8 and up.    [L.E.] I would also avoid relaunching Finder, if possible.   <comment304603> have you tried `killall Finder` ? <comment304604> Well, that will be the solution, if I don't come up with something better. (Added as a later edit above, probably as you were writing.) Thanks. <comment304605> Oh sorry I didn't read last sentence.. Just woke up :Z lol <comment304608> I appreciate the suggestion anyway. In rare instances, killing Finder may not automatically trigger a restart. Sure, I can use `open` to relaunch it but I've just ran over a scenario under which it may fail as well. I won't get into details.
