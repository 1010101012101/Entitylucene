How to auto-quit dropbox when a drive gets disconnected <body> I store all my photos on a connected thunderbolt drive.  I use a symlink in dropbox folder to keep the photos backed up to dropbox. all good.  If I need to take my laptop with me, and I disconnect the external drive, then dropbox no longer sees the photos link, and proceeds to delete all the pics from dropbox.  I would like to auto disable/ close dropbox when this external drive is disconnected.  Any ideas how ?
