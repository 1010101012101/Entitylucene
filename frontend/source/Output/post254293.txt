You will see it automatically download as long as you have enough disk space, and have Automatic Updates enabled.   strongYou must still specifically run the installer to upgrade to macOS Sierra./strong  hr  strongOriginal Answer/strong  macOS Sierra is not an strongupdate/strong. It is an strongupgrade/strong.   In macOS/OS X, upgrades are not automatically offered to you through the Update tab of the Mac App Store, nor the Automatic Updates functionality. You will not see behaviour like Microsoft offering Windows 10. strongYou must specifically download the installer (and run it) to upgrade to macOS Sierra./strong  Either click on its entry in the Mac App Store (currently in the Featured tab), or by opening this direct link.
