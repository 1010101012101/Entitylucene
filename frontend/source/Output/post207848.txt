AppleScript runs twice? <body> This script should say a b just once but many times it says a b a b.  I think this has something to do with Saved application stage. I emptied Saved application stage folder for this script then locked it. Then script works for a while but then after few runs it starts to say a b a b again.  How i can fix this?  precode--stay open  on run     say "a"     say "b" end run  on my_stuff()     say "my stuff" end my_stuff  on idle     my_stuff()     return 30 end idle  on quit     say "quit"     continue quit end quit /code/pre  <answer270525> Try to put a delay before such as:  precodeon run     delay 5     say "a"     say "b" end run /code/pre  <comment250766> What is "Saved application stage", do you mean "Saved Application State"? <comment250828> I mean "Saved Application State".
