How do I prevent incoming call notifications on a non-primary iPhone? <body> I am using an iPhone 6S as my primary work iPhone. I have an old iPhone 4 that I am trying to use as a dedicated baby monitor.  The iPhone 4 has had its SIM card removed, but it maintains WiFi access to our network.  Both are using the same apple ID.  Whenever my iPhone 6S receives a phone call, my iPhone 4 still shows an incoming call. I have gone into phone notifications and disabled everything. I'm not sure what else to disable to prevent it from ringing. Any ideas?  Both are running the latest IOS (10.3.1).  <answer283383> I have had this same problem, and fixed it by first turning off iCloud Drive. emThis fixes the shared call history between devices./em Second, go to Settings - Phone - Calls on Other Devices - Off emThis fixes calls ringing up between devices/em  In your case, you could also avoid the problem by turning on Do Not Disturb on the iPhone 4 â€” that will stop all notifications. It is found in Settings - Do Not Disturb  <comment357253> What happens when you sign out of your Apple ID on the iPhone 4?  Does it still ring? <comment357254> Have you tried: on your phone with the SIM, Settings  Phone  calls on other devices.  Turn off for all or for the other phone in question. <comment357256> By disabled everything do you mean do not disturb is also set? <comment357262> The OP has an iPhone 4 which can't be updated past iOS 7 (I think it's 7.1.2 but don't recall the exact minor version).  It can't run iOS 10.3.   Please edit your answer for the OPs iOS version. <comment357266> Done, thanks for the catch.
