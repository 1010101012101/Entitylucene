Get driver for AWUS036NHA <body> I bought an Alpha Network AWUS036NHA wireless network adapter.  I'm struggling to find a driver for it.  The best I could find was this: https://www.alfa.com.tw/download_show.php?combo_0=&amp;combo_1=&amp;combo_2=&amp;keyword=AWUS036NHA&amp;verify=A5HDEG&amp;x=32&amp;y=14  However, the only drivers listed here are for Windows.  Is there a driver for OSX?  <comment337558> According to http://www.alfa.com.tw/products_show.php?pc=34&ps=20, it only "Supports driver for Windows 2000, XP 32/64, Vista 32/64, Windows 7, Windows 8 & 8."
