Problems opening links on internet iphone 5S <body> When I search something on google and try to click on the returned items/links nothing happens. Please help, do I have to do something in my settings???  <answer232568> It's an iOS bug... My 5S is also affected   <answer232825> The bug affects not only links in Safari and Mail but also in Messages. I depend on the latter for employment, and it's a race with others when notifications come through, so copy &amp; paste is waaay too slow. Not happy!! :-( I'm using iOS 9.2.1
