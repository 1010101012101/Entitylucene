Use Caps lock key to click without 3rd-party software <body> Clicking became very difficult on my early 2009, 17" MacBook Pro with Mavericks (10.9.1). I thought about using the kbdCaps Lock/kbd key to send a mouse click.   I saw this question with an answer involving a third-party tool, but I wish to find a more low-level solution.  <answer125243> I don't know any way to do it without third party software, but it is possible with KeyRemap4MacBook and PCKeyboardHack.  First use PCKeyboardHack to change caps lock to F19. Then save this file as code~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook/private.xml/code:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;f19toclick&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;f19toclick&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F19, PointingButton::LEFT&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  Then open the KeyRemap4MacBook application, press the ReloadXML button, and enable the setting.  <comment146306> It would probably help to include which version of OSX you are using. <comment146328> Have you checked to see if your problem is the battery which can swell and push up under the trackpad <comment146330> What about a mouse? <comment146377> or maybe enable tap-to-click so you don't have to physically press on the keyboard (I'm assuming it is broken in some way..?) <comment147185> ok, found your solution documented in https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/pckeyboardhack.html.en#faq - it is excatly what I needed. I used ``brew cask install pckeyboardhack`` and ``brew cask install keyremap4macbook`` to install using homebrew casks. Works like a charm, thanks! <comment147186> @Rob : a mouse is not a solution for a laptop (for instance in a plane) :-) but thanks for the idea. <comment147188> @markhunte : indeed, it is perhaps the cause. but the battery is still functional so I will wait until it fails to change it. I hope it does not break more things...
