Automator service to extract file and delete parent <body> I am trying to create an automator service to take the selected folders in Finder and search each of them for movie files, move those movie files to a certain directory and then move the original folder to trash. However I have no experience and keep getting stuck!  Up the top of the automator window I have selected this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/C7ABI.png" alt="my service so far"  I then thought the best thing to do would be to use the "Get Folder Contents" action and run some sort of bash script on each file.  But what would I put in the script? I don't know how to write bash scripts. I was thinking something along the lines of:  for each directory for each file in the directory if the file is a movie move the file to this directory "path" move the parent directory to trash  I don't know if I should select "Pass input as arguments" or "as stdin". Either way I don't know how to work with them.  Can anyone give me a bit of help with this script?  Cheers!  <answer136532> Found the solution I was looking for here: http://www.macworld.com/article/1160660/automator_filesfromsubfolders.html  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZALF.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  <comment161979> Thanks for coming back to answer your question.
