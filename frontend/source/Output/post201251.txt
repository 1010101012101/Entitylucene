Odd retina iMac issues, hardware related <body> In the last few days I've had an odd combo of hardware issues on a rImac running 10.10.5. Haven't installed anything new but the most recent update; had been working fine before.  Sometimes a USB drive will just unmount itself; often one used for TM (yikes). It will remount, then unmount.  Sometimes the USB keyboard will go away until I reattach it. It's on a different hub and port on the iMac.  Once the Thunderbolt drive unmounted in the same way.  Once the BT mouse just quit.  Once power went out to another USB hub; I noticed cuz it's necessary for my external monitor.  Nothing jumped out at me from Console logs; I'd see stuff about drives not being accessible, etc.  Booted in safe mode and seemed to check out.  I reset the SMC and it's working right now; is that the most logical candidate? Basically ethernet is the only thing left that could turn off inexplicably.  Ideas?  <comment242580> Is it too late for you to take it back and exchange it for another one? <comment242726> Yes. Past the return period.
