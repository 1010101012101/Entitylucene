Are tags portable, and if so how? <body> I am a relatively new Mac user, recently bought a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.9.1.   I see that there are tagging capabilities within the file system. I'm concerned about portability. If I get a new computer in a few years, how would I transfer my tags to the new system? What if I want to move my files to a Windows or Linux machine? Can I see the tags on these operating systems?   I just don't want to put some effort into the built-in tagging system only to have my tags useless at some point down the road.  <answer122255> Yes, tags are completely portable as they are saved to the file as extended attributes. Copying/moving the file keeps the tags as they are saved as codecom.apple.metadata:_kMDItemUserTags/code to the file.  <answer122259> Tags are not 100% portable in that they don't always survive mailing or copying to other computers such as Linux or Windows. On that respect, it's more about those OS supporting the Apple filesystem. I am impressed that even copying tagged files to a SMB formatted USB drive preserves the tag metadata and most copy operations from and to another Mac via an HFS+ hard drive or share does preserve the tags well in practice. em(Even copying the file to a 10.8 or older Mac didn't strip tags in my tests)/em.  Apple's article covering tags, http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5839, recommends:     If you want to include your Tags when sending files through Mail, Messages, or other apps, compress your files and folders before sending them.   <comment142651> With regard to the Apple article, tags seem to be preserved on files when I send them through email without the need to compress themâ€¦ <comment142653> Yes, I am almost certain that initially, they were extremely non-portable and things have been shifting but I can't find an authoritative source or test / example of a tagged file from the 10.9(.0) release to test. <comment270447> Your answer is mostly correct, but IMO a strong warning is needed: Extended attributes are silently dropped by many tools which transfer or modify files. Attributes will also be lost if files are stored in a filesystem that doesn't support extended attributes, or has them disabled. <comment324540> One point is, are tags preserved if action X is taken (mail, zip, filesystem, etc). Answer: It depends ;-) But what is also very important (and I guess also the question): What if the OP changes to Linux? Is there a way to keep and manage those tags under Linux, or Windows??? <comment324570> @benzkji Let's split that off. It seems almost too broad for a specific question. What version of windows, what flavor of linux? I'll add a general sentence in my answer to not expect tags to work unless windows / linux preserves the HFS+ (or later APFS) filesystem in it's entirety and can read/write to that filesystem to show those tags. <comment324583> @bmike ok. just that the OP asked: "What if I want to move my files to a Windows or Linux machine? Can I see the tags on these operating systems?" <comment324584> @bmike I'm very curious, because this is where I am standing right now ;-) <comment324643> @benzkji I would ask a new question with your exact specifics. Link to here as the general case in the body of the question.
