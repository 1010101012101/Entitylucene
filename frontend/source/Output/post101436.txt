Automate Duplicating and Renaming Images <body> I've got an image and I need to duplicate it 800 times but add a new prefix every time I duplicate it. I've got the prefixes in a CSV file (or spreadsheet) and I'm wondering if there's a way that I can have Automator (or some other automation) program duplicate the image but rename the image with the different prefixes.  I'm aware of how to duplicate multiple images with the same prefix but is it possible to duplicate one image multiple times with different prefixes. Thanks for your help!  <answer101437> I whipped up a quick script that will copy the image for you (it will work with any type of file actually) and rename it from a plain text file with one prefix per line.  precode#!/bin/bash file=$1 prefixes=$2 filename=`basename "$file"` while read line do     cp $file "$line-$filename" done &lt; $prefixes /code/pre  Put that into a text file, save it as codecopier.sh/code. Then in Terminal, run codechmod +x copier.sh/code (make sure you’re in the same directory as where you saved the file, ideally the one with your images in it). Then run code./copier.sh myimage.jpeg prefixes.txt/code and you should have a bunch of copies with different names.  The codeprefixes.txt/code file (or whatever you want to name it) should have one prefix per line (which should be easy to get by copying and pasting from your spreadsheet).  hr  h3Updated Version With Folders/h3  precode#!/bin/bash file=$1 prefixes=$2 filename=`basename "$file"` foldername=${filename%%.*} if [ ! -d "$foldername" ]; then     mkdir "$foldername" fi while read line do     cp $file "$foldername"/"$line-$filename" done &lt; $prefixes /code/pre  That will create a folder with the same name as the original file (if it doesn’t already exist) and place the copies in it.  <comment119511> Interesting. I'll give that a shot. Thanks, I'll come back once I see if that works. <comment119512> Worked like a charm. Thank you so much. I'll be using this script quite a lot. <comment119513> One interesting thing is that the script ignored the last line of prefixes.txt file. Do you know why that would be happening? <comment119514> @MxmastaMills most Unix-y things (including the bash shell running the script) expect a blank line at the end of a file, so if your file didn’t have one, that’s likely the reason.

Is there a way to have the script automatically create a directory and place the new files directly into a new directory (maybe with the same name as the original file)? I can start a new question if that's needed. I've never worked with these kinds of scripts and am really fascinated by what they can do now... <comment119520> update: I found mkdir but it won't let me mkdir with a variable name <comment119526> @MxmastaMills just added a new version that does what you’re looking for. <comment119586> Great, thank you!
