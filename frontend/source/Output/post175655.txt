Gnuplot with xterm in yosemite <body> I installed gnuplot on my yosemite system using brew. When I try to plot codecos(x)/code the way I would on ubuntu, I get this:  precodegnuplot&gt; plot cos(x) WARNING: Plotting with an 'unknown' terminal. No output will be generated. Please select a terminal with 'set terminal'. /code/pre  I also notice that when gnuplot loads, it says codeTerminal type set to 'unknown'/code. I would like to load the graphs in a new window, so I tried codeset terminal xterm/code, which seems to work at first glance, given the message codeTerminal type set to 'xterm'/code. But then I try plotting again, and it produces garbage:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FNcSw.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I get the terminal to function correctly, as it does on ubuntu?  <answer180993> Don't know if you resolved, but seems strange to me you want to plot in the codexterm/code terminal... Perhaps you want to display in the codex11/code terminal, you'll then find this discussion useful: Can&#39;t plot with gnuplot on my Mac  <comment215416> I am trying `x11` but it says `unknown or ambiguous terminal type; type just 'set terminal' for a list` despite the fact that I have `x11` installed on my system. <comment215425> Ok, I followed the steps in the other post. Thanks for pointing out that I was confusing `xterm` with `x11`. <comment215433> you're welcome! gnuplot is always a little shady but is a powerful piece of software, never found something as powerful and flexible as it. <comment260988> As an aside, if you want to get away from X11 and remembering if you are in xterm or terminal app, just switch `gnuplot` to use qt - it sets up the terminal properly and one shot install: `brew reinstall gnuplot --with-qt`
