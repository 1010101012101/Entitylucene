How many additional numbers can I set in one contact? <body> As the title says, how many additional numbers can I set in one contact? I was playing around with a script and I was able to get even 2000 of them in on an iPhone 6 simulator. However, would like some official response about what is the max.  <answer249371> There is no limit as to how many numbers you can get on a contact.  <comment309305> could you please back that up with some official documentation? Not that I don't trust you, it's asked of me. <comment309322> @Nikola there is a limit, it's whenever you run out of storage space to put the numbers.
