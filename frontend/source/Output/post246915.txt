Shortcuts for Inserting objects in PowerPoint for Mac <body> The screenshot shows the common items to be inserted into a PowerPoint Presentation. Being on a Mac, of course we are handicapped on not having mnemonics support to perform the action by the keyboard.  Or are there some shortcuts to do these?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ilbu2.jpg" alt="enter image description here"  The point here is that needing to hunt for the menu item with the mouse and then click on the item is way slow compared to keyboarding.  strongUpdate/strong: An answer was provided with a link to the shortcuts provided by MS online help. I should have noted that link had already been pored over and does not mention any shortcuts for "Insert" items.  <answer246916> There are keyboard shortcuts for emalmost/em every menu command.  Here's a link for Microsoft's Office for Mac keyboard shortcuts site.  I normally frown on just posting a link but because there's so many shortcuts available it doesn't make sense to copy/paste them all here.  Also, if you don't find the shortcut you're looking for, you can always create your own.  <comment304632> Maybe I should have noted in the OP that I had already pored through that list.  None of the "Insert" commands are provided. <comment304634> Did you create your own shortcut with one of those 'insert' commands that you want?  Maybe that will help.  It looks like Microsoft doesn't want to support keyboard shortcuts for many of those menu commands. <comment304637> Have you looking at either [OS X El Capitan: Create keyboard shortcuts for apps](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21534) or [OS X Yosemite: Create keyboard shortcuts for apps](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18418) and tried creating a application shortcut for the "Text Box" menu command?. <comment304641> that is of course an option for any app but a heavyweight one..   I guess there simply aren't shortcuts already available.
