I am stuck with bad Internet Recovery after formatting my Macintosh HD <body> Long story short I formatted my Macintosh HD to clean install El Capitan but whenever I use Internet Recovery to install it, the setup gets stuck. I checked logs and it is showing "tsplicedfont failed creating descriptor"  I believe if I formatted my Macintosh HD I can't use USB drive to install OS X so I need your help
