How do I change settings in QuickTime 10? <body> I'm trying to follow these instructions on configuring QuickTime so I can use a browser-based web app that uses QuickTime as a plugin in FireFox: http://tones.wolfram.com/tsfaqs/osx/configurequicktime.html  I'm using QuickTime Player version 10.4 (833.1). The instructions I'm reading clearly indicate that QuickTime Player should have a Preferences option in its menu bar, as shown in this picture:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CTlAT.jpg" alt="http://i.stack.imgur.com/CTlAT.jpg"  However, my version of QuickTime Player does not seem to have any preferences whatsoever:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YPIIx.png" alt="enter image description here"  How do I change QuickTime settings using QuickTime Player 10.4?  <answer179144> For that website you need the legacy version of QuickTime player. It is called codeQuickTime player 7/code and is located in your code/Applications/Utility/code folder.  If it is not there get it from Apple.  <comment212296> Open the "QuickTime player 7", in your Utility folder. <comment212297> I don't have QuickTime Player 7 in my Applications/Utilities folder.
