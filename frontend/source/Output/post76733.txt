Unable to install software packages using Home Brew <body> I am unable to install any software packages using homebrew.

This was because I was behind a server that blocks/does not allow a given size of downloads. I got frustrated for days until I moved to another network when it successfully downloaded it, though there was still that problem of SHA1 mismatch when I try to install. But it was giving the error with the actual SHA of the correct download (I was getting this SHA on expected for the corrupted files).  To fix this I run codebrew edit sdl_image/code and copied the actual to the SHA in this document.  <comment89698> This should work. It's a corrupt file issue. Also run `brew doctor`, `brew cleanup` and `brew update` to be safe. <comment327701> solved my problem
