How can I avoid different windows of the same app get folded in at the dock? <body> Some times I have apps opened with more than one windows, like Chrome. How can I see in the Dock one icon per each windows (even they are of the same app) that I have open?  Would be nice know how to switch using kbdcommand/kbd+kbdtab/kbd or something like that between all the windows opened.  <answer198319> The dock does not shows the windows but the applications.  But once you choose an application you can switch among windows with kbdcommand/kbd+kbd`/kbd  To see all the open windows you can use exposé: press kbdF10/kbd to show all the windows of the current application or kbdF9/kbd for all the windows. You can also configure a gesture in the system preferences.   <answer198321> Depending on how your System prefs are set, kbd F3 /kbd will do a variety of window-juggling tasks…  If Prefs  Keyboard  Keyboard is set to default, with "Use all F1, F2…" emunchecked/em then they will work as stated, if it's emchecked/em you will need to add the kbd Fn /kbd key to each of these commands.  kbd F3 /kbd will toggle Mission Control - all windows of all apps &amp; Desktops spread out so you can see them.  kbd Cmd ⌘ /kbd kbd F3 /kbd will toggle desktop view only.  kbd Ctrl ⌃ /kbd kbd F3 /kbd will show all windows of only the frontmost app *[this is likely to be the closest to what you need.]  kbd Shift ⇧ /kbd kbd F3 /kbd will do the same as just kbd F3 /kbd … only really really emslowly/em [for presentations etc]  kbd Opt ⌥ /kbd kbd F3 /kbd will bring up Mission Control prefs, where you can tweak other behaviour.  You can also go directly to a given tab by right-clicking the app icon in the Dock, though it only shows the frontmost tab's title for each window.  <comment237264> Thanks for your reply.  So no way in Mac of have an easy to access list of all the windows I have opened? or a shortcut to switch between all the windows no matter if they are of the same app or not? <comment237266> See my edit. Not the same but could maybe work ... <comment237292> None of those keys worked. <comment237293> Thanks for your reply. Is really frustrating don't have this feature on Mac. <comment237308> Ahh… a late thought, I'll add to the answer - you can go to a specific window if you right click the icon in the Dock - but the label only shows the frontmost tab's title <comment237330> Yes, already realize that. Thanks again, I'm really impressed that OS X don't have this feature, very uncomfortable ;) <comment237341> Horses for courses, I guess - personally even on Windows I consolidate to stop it doing the, imo, irritating one-window-per-icon thing ;)
