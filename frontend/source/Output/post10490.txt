How can I delete my iPad's available downloads from iTunes? <body> I have so many downloads available. I want to get rid of them because iTunes password keeps popping up. I tried swiping and what not, doesn't work :  <answer10817> Are they purchased downloads? You can try right clicking on them and delete, if they still come back, contact iTunes Customer Support and ask them to remove strongXX/strong items from your queue, or if you want everything removed, just ask and they can remove it permanently.  You can shoot them an email at: http://apple.com/support/itunes/contact.html  <comment11010> What kind of downloads? <comment11108> This question needs either a screen shot or more information. <comment11452> I can't right click with an iPad.. I bought the first season of pretty little liars, for some reason the second season came, I didn't buy it but I guess I have access to it. I have watched them on tv so I don't need them anymore. I don't want to download them because I'm worried it might be too much data for my wifi and have to pay extra. So solution deleting, but guess it's not possible. Thank you anyway <comment11456> If it's in your downloads queue, you were charged for it. Check your purchase history. On your iPad try swiping to the right over the item you want to delete, the [DELETE] red button should appear.  I'd suggest emailing in to see if you can get them refunded (if you purchased them recently) and have them removed from your pending downloads queue. The support advisors will always be able to remove your pending downloads whatever they may be, excluding podcasts. <comment11631> I tried swiping. And I tried to email but I have to either be using a Mac or windows. It won't go through. I don't understand :( and how do I check purchase history....sorry..... <comment11634> To view your purchase history, you'll have to be on a computer with iTunes. You will then have to login to your iTunes account (in the iTunes Store), then Choose Store (at the top right of iTunes) then click View My Account. Next in the Account Information window, click Purchase History. and Volia. I suggest you shoot iTunes Customer Support an email via a Mac or PC, they'll get back to you within the day or early next day depending on when you submit the request. <comment11735> Ok I will try that thank you very much <comment11842> Your very welcome! <comment13357> +1: I had to send an email to support with an Order Number of what I wanted removed.
