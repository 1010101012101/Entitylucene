How do I restore Dashboard widget list? (Launchpad-style adding) <body> When using a tutorial to clear Launchpad of its mess I had in /Applications, I accidentally cleared Dashboard's list of widgets when I click the (+) button to add downloaded widgets at the same time, kind of like Launchpad's viewing of apps.  Here is my Dashboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtKfz.jpg" alt="Dashboard, normal state"  And here it is when I click the (+) button to add downloaded widgets in the bottom left corner of Dashboard:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aU2HM.jpg" alt="No widgets to be found"  I believe it will only show new widgets I download. How can I get it to show all of my widgets again—including the default, built-in widgets?  (This is my Launchpad: it looks similar to the "add widgets" of Dashboard.app in Mountain Lion, but I am looking how to restore my list of widgets in Dashboard, not Launchpad.)  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VQ8SY.jpg" alt="Launchpad, 10.8.2"  Also, it probably doesn't make a large difference, but my Dashboard is set as a Space and not an overlay right now.  <answer92561> I encountered the same problem, but now have a partial solution:  If you want to refresh the list entirely, delete the .db file located in code"~/Library/Application Support/Dock/"/code, followed by running codekillall Dock/code. This forces the Dock to refresh its list of widgets. Unfortunately, the list of apps in Launchpad will also be reset.   You can remove these individually via   precodesqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dock/*.db "DELETE from apps WHERE title='APP_NAME';" &amp;&amp; killall Dock /code/pre  (from http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Apps-from-Launchpad-in-Mac-Os-X-Lion, which adds:  precode Replace APP_NAME with the name of the unwanted app as it’s displayed in LaunchPad. /code/pre  )  I wish I knew how to add widgets manually, but I really don't know much unix... If it's any help to those trying to find a better solution, the widgets are located in code/Library/Widgets/code.  strongUpdate/strong  In the end I just decided to use Launchpad Manager to delete apps. It also functions as a widget manager.
