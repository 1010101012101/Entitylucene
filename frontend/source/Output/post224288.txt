How can I add additional paper sizes to Automator services? <body> I'm attempting to create a service using Automator from the codePhotos &gt; New PDF Contact Sheet/code action. However, the Paper size option only allows me to select codeUS Letter/code and codeA4/code.  The print drivers for the printer I am using support Tabloid, as well as a ton of over sizes. How can I add additional Paper sizes?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yH386.png" alt="Screenshot of Automator"
