Resize shortcuts in `tmux` does not work properly <body>    I'm trying to learn about codetmux/code on codemacOS Sierra/code with codeiterm2/code/codealacritty/code.   codePrefix/code, codeCtrl/code + codeArrow/code is work only horizontal split, and codePrefix/code, codeAlt/code + codeArrow/code is work both split.  I'm currently referencing cheat sheet on the web for shortcuts.  Mostly, they tell pane resize shortcut is codePrefix/code, codeCtrl/code+codeArrow/code.  codePrefix/code, codeAlt/code + codeArrow/code work on my system as I wanted but it seems not a normal way.  Could you explain about this?  Thanks in advance!
