Switch between sound profiles iPhone? <body> I have found no way that iPhone is able to do what I need here. I have iOS 6.x (jailbroken).  I would like to set 3-4 Sounds themes (basic feature of all Nokia). Example I need:  ul listrongNormal/strong: vibrance ok, sounds normal/li listrongHigh tone/strong: volume up/li listrongSilence/strong: vibrance ok but only with a single low tone to alert of SMS, email etc/li listrongDead/strong: no vibrance, no sounds./li /ul  Is there any app or somethign that let me set this 4 profiles?  I have not been able to find a way to do this with either jailbreak tweaks nor with the built in iOS.  em(Please note I know I can switch between silence and do not disturb, but I want to personalize this profiles, also I need high tone profile)/em  <answer84293> SBProfiles will let you set up profiles for lots of settings on your phone - including sound and vibration. Here's a YouTube video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlGjZ6UACFs  Intelliborn once had an app called MyProfiles (http://intelliborn.com/myprofiles.html) but it has been discontinued and only works on iOS 4  <answer115590> Yes you can! But now sbsettings does not support IOS 7 yes. But earlier versions there is no problem.  <comment96983> I can't comment on jailbroken apps, as I haven't jailbroken since 2008. However, I can confirm that there is no way to replicate the Nokia-style sound profiles on iOS. You can turn the ringer volume up for High Tone, and you can toggle vibrate on and off in Settings. I understand this is not the same. This is something that frustrated me when I switched from Nokia to iPhone but have since come to appreciate the simplicity of the vibrate switch. <comment96988> @bispymusic, very well put. I have (and still am) observing one individual switch from BB to iPhone and another from Android to iPhone. The main thing I have noticed (particularly with the x-BB user) is that they got used to the (over)-complexity of particularly the BB system. Overtime, the appreciation for simplicity comes. <comment97039> Yes SBProfiles is what it get closer to my question. The problem with SBprofiles is that you can't change the ring for the various profiles... Or can you? <comment97119> I don't think you can change the ring. Wish someone would develop an app to make it easy like the old Nokia phones. <comment119049> Anyone know if this will change with iOS 7? <comment135254> The OP is on iOS 6, so you should provide some more detailed information on how this can be accomplished.
