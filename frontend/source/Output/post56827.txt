Getting the whole iTunes not found list <body> When I sync iTunes with a device I get the standard list of items that didn't sync because they weren't found.  My question is that this dialog (pictured below) is neither resizable nor do the entries copy to the pasteboard. (Not to mention the fact that you can't select more than one, let alone all of them)  Is this information dumped to any logs so that I can copy this all en-masse rather than trying to copy this information one item at a time?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GaeVN.png" alt="Image of question" Personal info redacted through Gaussian blur.  Yes, I've filed a radar.  <comment68398> So you're not interested in fixing it? You just want to know if the info is dumped into any logs? <comment68602> I'm trying to fix the warning, but it's a bit of a pain to have to go thru it one by one with only 4 on the screen at once, rather than seeing the whole list at once. <comment68682> Try to open iTune from comandline and see the output: `$ /Applications/iTunes.app/Contents/MacOS/iTunes`
