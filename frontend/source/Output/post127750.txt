Can't connect to any site on MacBook. <body> here is the problem. On my MacBook Pro with mavericks I can't connect to any site with working wifi(checked it on ipad). Also, Skype and utorrent are working fine, but all browsers can't connect. Restart MacBook and wifi didn't help.   <answer128002> If you are able to use Skype and uTorrent, but not able to use Safari or Chrome, I would recommend that you try resetting the SMC. In my comment above, I recommended trying to ping external addresses which would determine the status of your network connectivity.  <comment149978> Are you able to ping external websites? Open Terminal.app and run ping on some address. Try ping 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS). Have you tried with multiple browsers?
