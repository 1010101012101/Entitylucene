Box of text superimposed over website <body> I'm developing a website and one of the people testing it on Safari 9 / OSX has sent this to me:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6jHSy.jpg" alt="Weird problem"  Needless to say, strongI didn't create the template with a white rectangle of text superimposed over the content!!/strong.   Can anyone tell me what this is? I don't have physical access to the user's laptop (he's using OSX El Capitan, Safari 9) and I can't recreate the issue on any other computer or even an OSX/Safari 9 instance on Browserstack.com.  It's probably something simple (a feature of some kind?) that the user inadvertently activated either in Safari or OSX but as I am not a user of OSX I wouldn't know.  Note: There's nothing in the "alt" or "title" HTML tag of the image that the user is hovering over in the screenshot, nor is there anything in my CSS or HTML that would cause this to happen.  A restart of the affected laptop caused this issue to disappear but I'm still curious about what it is/was in case it happens again.
