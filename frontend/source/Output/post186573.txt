How to open migration assistant on an ipad <body> How do I open migration assistant on an iPad-2?  I have tried in settings but can not find it.  <answer186576> If you still have the old iPad, make a backup via iTunes or iCloud, reset the new iPad if you have already activated it as a new iPad, and when asked, select the "Restore from backup" option.
