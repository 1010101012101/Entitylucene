Where are my Pages documents? <body> Recently replaced iMac hard drive through recall program. Used Time Machine/Seagate Backup Drive. Everything seems to be restored but my Pages documents. How do I find them?  <answer88892> What about looking for files with the pages extension (.pages) in spotlight?  Open spotlight (keyboard shortcut: kbdCommand/kbd + kbdSpacebar/kbd ) and type: strong.pages/strong   If you see a file popping up, hold kbdCommand/kbd an click on it. The file's location will then be opened in finder.   <comment104223> If you're using recent OSX and Pages, were you documents stored to the cloud by default?
