How do I restore default terminal command for Notifications on Yosemite? <body> On Yosemite I disabled notifications with the following terminal command:  precodecd `getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR` rm -rf com.apple.notificationcenter killall usernoted; killall NotificationCenter /code/pre  Does anyone know what I need to type to restore the original default notification setting?  <answer155064> What you've done here is delete the entire Notification Center database, not simply disable Notification Center. You will need to restore this container, preferably from a backup. Alternatively, you can reinstall OS X.  <comment182415> Yikes!!!!!To do reinstall OS X, do I need to reformat my hard drive or can I just reinstall OS 10 on top of what I have?
