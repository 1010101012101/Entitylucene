Why does this PDF does not appear properly in iOS? <body> This PDF uses the embedded fonts Graphik-Regular and Graphik-Medium. When viewed in various readers on OS X, Windows, Android, Acrobat, the font appears correctly. When viewed in iOS, the Graphik fonts appear as a Helvetica variant. Is this a problem with iOS, or a problem with the PDF?  The PDF was created using the open source library libHaru.  Here are the document font properties as seen in Acrobat  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AjvhW.png" alt="enter image description here"  <comment208652> Does the font not appear properly in any iOS-based PDF viewer, or just the default one? <comment208932> Have you tried reading it with Adobe Reader for iOS? or  GoodReader?  You can't rely on Mail or iBooks to do everything correctly. <comment208986> The font does not appear properly in Safari or iBooks. It does appear fine in Acrobat Reader. <comment209005> Yes, I understand that Safari and iBooks do not do everything correctly. But that answer does not help in this case. The question is what is it about this PDF that prevents the fonts from being seen in the native viewer (via Safari) in iOS. Is there something about the construction of this PDF that could be improved?
