How can I open an application when a secondary monitor is connected? <body> I use SecondBar to add a menu bar to an external display. I've added it to my login items, but I don't want it to open when there isn't an external display. How do I open SecondBar when a secondary monitor is connected?  <answer56998> There is no way of automatically doing it with out modifying the operating system, as the display is managed as a core process. The best is just to put a shortcut on your desktop and open it when you are plugging in a display  <answer57002> Take a look at the free/open source app ControlPlane.  You can trigger different actions based on context-sensitive rules, including launching an app in response to connecting a display.  <comment65491> Great answer and great app!! I love it!! Just as a note, it can be a bit confusing, so read the help pages. They *do* actually help. =D <comment65524> Well, it obviously isn't that hard to "modify the operating system" as you say, because ControlPlane works just fine.
