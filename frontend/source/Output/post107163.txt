Canon MP780 support, and borderless printing, in Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks? <body> Has anyone got their Canon Pixma MP780 to print borderless in Mavericks?   Its support was removed after the CanonPrinterDrivers2.8 (as of writing we are on 2.12). I keep the 2.8 drivers and they worked well with 10.7, 10.8, and now 10.9 (mostly work). However in 10.9 the borderless printing is no longer working. I tried printing from several apps and I just cannot get borderless to work.   Anyone know how to fix this?  <comment133473> My interim solution is to run VMware Fusion with a Mac OS X 10.8 guest, install the drivers on that, and share the printer out from the guest.
