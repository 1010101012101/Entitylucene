How to disable command-Q for Quit? <body> Is there any way to disable kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd for quitting apps?  I tried adding this menuitem to the "Keyboard Shortcuts" preference pane (as suggested here), and remapping it to kbdcommand/kbd+kbdoption/kbd+kbdQ/kbd (slightly harder to hit), and the menu item changed to show this, but kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd still causes the app to quit.  I'm using OS X 10.7, but I'd happily upgrade to 10.8 if it fixed this.  The app I really want this for is Firefox, but if there was a solution that disabled kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd for every app, that would be fine, too.  <answer78965> Not a direct answer to your question, but you can tell Firefox to automatically open your old windows when you launch it using the codeWhen Firefox starts/code option under the codeGeneral/code preferences pane.  If you don't want to change your start screen just for the occasional accidental quit, there is also a command to do it: codeHistory/code menu - codeRestore Previous Session/code.  <answer78971> As you have seen, just setting a new keyboard shortcut in the System Prefs doesn't always work.  It will change the shortcut shown in the menu but the application could still be listening for the Commmand+Q keypress.  I've seen a few apps that do this.  Even some will listen to keypresses that are not listed as shortcuts in the menu (Photoshop for example).  A 3rd party option is to use something like ControllerMate.  It has the ability to remap any controller input (keyboard, mouse, trackpad, joystick, etc) and change what it does.  I use it to do many remaps and run macro scripts.  They can be set on a per-application basis or a global system-wide state.  Using ControllerMate, you could map Command+Q to do nothing then have Command+Option+Q call the Quit menu entry.  Or you could get fancy and have Command+Q do nothing except if you press Command+Q again within 1/2 of a second then it would call the Quit menu.  ControllerMate is an amazing app.  I've done many customizations like a "Boss/Spouse Mode" which is a single keypress that does the following  ul limutes the computer audio/li lipauses iTunes if it is playing/li liquits QuickTime and/or VLC if it is running/li liminimizes current Firefox windows and opens a new window to Google.com/li /ul  Another suggestion (along with Henry's suggestion) is to use a session manager so if Firefox is quit by accident, you can restore easily.  The built-in session manager is OK but you should also look at Tab Mix Plus.  Not only does it give you amazing options for managing your tabs but its session manager is also great.  I have many sessions saved and can pull them up quickly anytime in new windows.  <answer90798> Use a keyboard remapper.  There's a great GPL one for OSX (I use Keyremap4MacBook) Just map the command Q key combo to something that does nothing.  <answer90827> Using KeyRemap4MacBook, you could add this to private.xml:  precode&lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;disable_command_q&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;disable_command_q&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | VK_SHIFT | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::Q, ModifierFlag::COMMAND_L&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  Without code| ModifierFlag::NONE/code the first autogen element would also disable for example ⌥⌘Q. The second autogen element changes ⇧⌘Q to ⌘Q.  There are also predefined settings that make sending ⌘Q require holding ⌘Q or pressing ⌘Q twice:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUDAk.png" alt=""  They are defined in custom_shortcuts.xml:  precode&lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;Hold Command+Q to Quit Application&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;appendix&gt;(You can adjust the threshold time of holding by&lt;/appendix&gt;   &lt;appendix&gt;"[Holding Key to Key] Holding Threshold" in Key Repeat tab.)&lt;/appendix&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;remap.holdcommandQ&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__HoldingKeyToKey__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE, KeyCode::VK_NONE, KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND, Option::NOREPEAT&lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; &lt;item&gt;   &lt;name&gt;Press Command+Q twice to Quit Application&lt;/name&gt;   &lt;identifier&gt;remap.doublepresscommandQ&lt;/identifier&gt;   &lt;autogen&gt;__DoublePressModifier__ KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND | ModifierFlag::NONE,     KeyCode::VK_NONE,     KeyCode::Q, VK_COMMAND   &lt;/autogen&gt; &lt;/item&gt; /code/pre  <answer116702> Sorry for digging up such old post but this idea may be useful.  In System Preferences - Keyboard create a new shortcut for the application you want to prevent quit. Search for the title of the quit command in the application's menu and enter the same exact as a Menu Title for the shortcut, then give a different shortcut.  Indeed, you don't have this issue with all applications but only browser and maybe one or two other apps.  <answer155185> Now there is an item in the Chrome application menu "Warn Before Quitting" which does the trick for me.  Source: http://lifehacker.com/5784153/how-to-bring-back-the-hold-q-to-quit-prompt-in-google-chrome  <answer205742> Go to System Preferences, then Keyboard. Select Shortcuts. On the left pane, find Accessibility. Now on the right pane enable emInvert colors/em and then click on the shortcut box to reassign the shortcut to Cmd+Q.  That's it. Now when you press Cmd+Q the colors of the screen will be inverted. Press it again to go back to normal colors. No more accidentally quitting applications (like closing over two hundred tabs on Firefox when trying to use Cmd+a or three dozen pdfs on Preview when trying to use Cmd+tab; last two things I did, never again.)  P.S. Whoever thought it was a good idea to use Cmd+Q to quit applications should go back to usability school.  hr  There's also a nice plugin that you can use called Always Ask, which forces a prompt dialog before leaving Firefox.  <answer223505> Go to emSystem PreferencesKeyboardShortcuts/em then the strongemapplication button on the left bar/em/strong. Press the strong+/strong button then Choose your application. Write "Quit (Application Name)" in the Menu Title Slot. Add your command to replace cmd-q and that's it.  <answer264259> Simply I have replaced the existing command with new one,  Ex. I replaced Quit command for Sublime Text for MAC,  I used to Add new shortcut and added new command codealt+command+c/code  <answer272223> I have found a way to do this without having to change your volume or stuff like that when you press kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd.  go to system preferences - keyboard - mission control - "do not disturb".   Then just click the box and change it to: kbdcommand/kbd+kbdQ/kbd.  <comment91259> Are you looking for a global hack or would you be able to just remap the applications you want to override? The latter is quite easy using the normal keyboard preference pane and making another shortcut (like command - shift - control - option - Q) that won't get pressed on a whim. <comment91280> bmike: I'd take either, but as I said, I tried making it command-option-Q and it doesn't work.  If I try entering command-option-shift-Q, it beeps and says the app System Prefs has cancelled logout. <comment91285> The problem is you need to over ride quit on a per application basis and include the app name so that the full menu name is entered in the app-specific shortcut. <comment91378> bmike: I was specifying the override for Firefox only, and including the app name in the menuitem override. <comment91380> Hmm - I didn't read the question to mean that Firefox intentionally disregards keyboard shortcut defined by OS X - but perhaps that's what you are seeing based on the comments? I wonder if perhaps they implemented a shortcut remapping function? It's been a while since I've had the fox running. Choosing a command like ⌃⇧⌘Z works to make Command-Q insensitive for Mail and Safari - see this picture for how I set the shortcuts up. http://cl.ly/MDtE <comment91382> Yes, but if there are many windows/tabs open, that can take quite a while, and some won't be able to recover their session/state completely.  It also annoyingly restores all windows onto the current space, rather than the space they were on previously. <comment91384> bmike: I don't think so.  I tried remapping Automator in the same way, and it shows command-option-Q in the menu but still quits when I press command-Q.  I think it's OS X that's (half) ignoring the remapping. <comment106612> You are right - this appears to be a Firefox bug and not an OS X issue. I've successfully remapped Command-Q on other apps, but firefox disregards these mappings (I used Q to map to About Firefox so it should open the about window in theory - but in practice, firefox still quits.) <comment136499> Welcome to Ask Different!

But it doesn't work. cmd-q still closes the browser... <comment161637> My apologies for this promotion, but I have an open source app that will add a global delay to ⌘Q so that you can catch accidental ⌘Qs. https://github.com/dteoh/SlowQuitApps <comment195751> I followed [this link](http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-disable-Command-q-in-OS-X) that describes the same solution and that worked perfectly for me. <comment270996> This adds nothing that the other answers haven't already covered. <comment271799> $24.95 for an input remapper? That's hilarious. <comment285183> Related: http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45252/can-i-globally-change-the-cmd-q-shortcut-to-require-holding-for-two-seconds-lik <comment321077> Just registered here to upvote this answer. `Cmd+Q` is the equivalent of making an `@` symbol on a German PC-105 keyboard layout. Switching between PC and Mac is driving me crazy because I keep closing the browser when logging in somewhere. Thanks for the brilliant idea with inverting colors. <comment342168> Now called Karabiner: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/ Does not work under 10.12, will handle earlier OS's. There's a pre-written shortcut for globally changing cmd Q to something else here: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/list.html.en under **Custom Shortcuts** <comment342239> I just added an "Option Q" shortcut for "Quit Firefox" as an Application specific (Firefox) shortcut for Firefox. In Firefox, my "Quit Firefox" menu item now shows opt Q, and cmd Q no longer quits the App, but opt Q does. You have to get the text of the menu item exactly right. Oh, I see, we're a couple years into the future here; with OS X 10.12.3. and Firefox 51.0. <comment342613> I assigned it to "Switch to desktop 1". Since I'm not using this feature anyway, it effectively does nothing. <comment358777> Bonus point for using Invert colors as a warning. Great UX feedback. <comment360447> +1 for the usability school comment <comment364299> +1 for the usability school (Apple people should go back to that definitely) <comment367668> Good fit for Safari (Safari respects the shortcut), and a sanity-saver for those of us who often hit CMD+Q instead of CMD+W.
