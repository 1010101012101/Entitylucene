Text substitution does not work with Slack on Yosemite <body> I have a text substitution setup within the System Preferences. This works most places within OS X as far as I can tell, but it does not work in Slack. (Their native app for OS X version 1.1.4 - 2814)  Does anyone know why?  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GX1ub.png" alt="enter image description here"  strongUPDATE/strongbr It looks like this is not specific to Slack at all  <answer210274> So, it seems that Text Substitutions have not been implemented in Chrome so I assume that is the underlying problem I'm having with Slack.  <answer236359> Activate the "Text Replacement" option in the edit menu.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/srGR5.jpg" alt="option to activate text replacement"  <answer244981> Even after following the instructions in the accepted answer, this still did not work for me until I followed these instructions. Basically, run the following in a terminal:  codedefaults write -g WebAutomaticTextReplacementEnabled -bool true/code  <comment253415> Are you using a slack application (if so what version and name) or a browser (if so what version and name)? <comment253416> Sorry, I should have mentioned that. I'm using the official Slack client for Mac OS X, version 1.1.4 (2814). <comment253419> If you have Chrome, does it work there? Slack uses the same engine. <comment253472> No, it doesn't work in Chrome either, so it looks like it's more likely to be a Chrome issue? <comment289431> @carrieje's answer is correct. You don't have to wait for Chrome to implement anything! <comment357868> Wow, man. I came here because my substitution of shrugs not working in Slack. :) The only difference is that my shortcut is '\/' (two slashes) <comment357869> Don't have such menu items for Slack "2.6.1 Direct Download" and macOS Sierra 10.12.4 (16E195) :( <comment371210> 2nd "wow": It looks like the substitution do work in native slack app, only UI part is broken and not shown. I believe if you write `&shrug;` in slack text area and hit spacebar the replacement will occur.
