How do I emulate iOS Clash Royale on Windows? <body> I have no experience with apple devices. How do I emulate iOS Clash Royale on windows? i mean, emulating Clash royale but the ios one.  <answer271098> You can't.   There is no emulation software for Windows to run iOS apps.br Even on Mac you must have the source code, you cannot run a compiled app.  <comment340779> Y'know, from a cultural archival perspective, I'm pretty worried that all these games will be completely unplayable in a decade, what with how locked down iOS is + crappy legacy support. Even now, how would one go about playing stuff like Rolando?
