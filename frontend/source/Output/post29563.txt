Sudo with Sidekick <body> Sidekick is a helpful little tool which adjusts the system settings based on geographical location.  I added an action which will execute a codesudo/code command-line command. The problem is that the Terminal pops up and asks me for the password. Is there a way to allow Sidekick to execute codesudo/code without asking for a password?  <answer29578> You can disable password prompt when calling sudo in combination with certain commands by editing the sudoers file. This is done by opening a terminal and running codesudo visudo/code. You have to add the follwing lines  precodeCmnd_Alias SIDEKICK_CMDS = /full/path/to/the/command1,  /full/path/to/the/command2  yourUsername ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SIDEKICK_CMDS /code/pre  Be careful with this, as it may lead to security risks.  It enables anyone logged in  with your account ( so not just sidekick) to run the  commands in the list without a password prompt.   For a full description of the codesudoers/code options check the manpage : codeman sudoers/code  <comment33933> The real question is, do you really want to? `sudo` requires a password after regular intervals for a good reason. http://www.gratisoft.us/sudo/sudo.man.html <comment33934> I want to enable and disable some sharing settings: turning file, web sharing and remote management on and off. This is possible without a password anyways via System Preferences. Sadly this is not supported by AppleScript.
