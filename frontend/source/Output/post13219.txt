Smooth zoom in safari <body> You know the way you smoothly zoom-in in mobile safari? How do I do that on my Mac + magic trackpad in regular safari?  <answer13220> Its a pinch motion just like mobile safari.  To activate it, make sure Pinch Open and Close is ticked in System Preferences  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/c3SZx.png" alt="enter image description here"  <answer15034> Wait for 10.7 "Lion" there'll you get the same zooming as on the iPad and you can even double-click on columns to zoom the to full window width.  <comment13953> Thanks, but I did have pinch enabled and the "zoom thing" worked but it was not smooth. It works in very rough steps - 100%, 120% 140% or so.... instead I would like it to zoom smoothly from 100% trough 101%, 102%  all the way down <comment13954> Actually, what I want is my desktop safari to zoom like preview.... <comment13966> Unfortunately, the zoom in and zoom out functions are hard coded to jump in largeish increments. The pinch options just trigger an increment after they detect your much finer pinches over a period of time. <comment16283> How do you know that?
