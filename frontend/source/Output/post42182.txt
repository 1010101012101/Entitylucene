How can I make my 27" iMac and my 27" Thunderbolt display the same height? <body> I'm using an external 27" Thunderbolt display with my 27" iMac and I want the iMac and display to have the same height. By default, the Thunderbolt display is about an inch shorter than the iMac, which is quite annoying.  I'm sure this problem comes up all the time. Is there any solution for evening out the heights? I'm open to something as hacky as "this book is the right height – put it under the display."  <answer42194> I'd recommend buying this book:   http://www.amazon.com/Life-Times-Thunderbolt-Kid-Memoir/dp/0767919378/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330596630&amp;sr=8-7  It's exactly 1" thick, put it under the monitor.  <answer42198> If you want something more elegant than a book under the iMac, you can can add vesa mounts to your iMac and Thunderbolt display and then attach it to a desk or wall mounted adjustable monitor arm.  There are many to choose from but here is one pictured below to give you an example. So you could technically mount both or just one to a VESA stand. Note that most monitor stands allow you to infinitely adjust the height, angle, rotation, with in pre-determined ranges.  Just be aware of the maximum weight capacity of the VESA monitor mount you choose. The 27" iMac weighs 11.2kg or ~ 24.7 LBS and the 27" Thunderbolt display weighs ~ 10kg or ~ 22.1 LBS without their included stands.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wIv1z.png" alt="Apple Montors on a Vesa Desk Mount"  <answer42211> A piece of plywood (or, if necessary, two pieces of plywood sandwiched together) or cutting board made from  bamboo or plastic can provide material for risers. You can easily cut and sand these materials with simple tools. Hardwood can also be used, though it will be harder to shape. Fit and finish quality will depend on your skill and patience, but if you use one of the softer materials,  a casual evening's work should produce something that registers okay at three feet.  On the other hand, if you have access to a CNC router or a emBridgeport/em mill you can machine the riser out of a solid block of aluminum to produce an aesthetically pleasing solution.  You could take this one step further by extending the riser out towards the viewer and incorporate cut-out trays to store the mouse, paperclips, etc.  <answer42213> Carefully tap the outer "corners" of the base of the Thunderbolt Display to accept threaded "leveler" feet commonly found on the bottom of tables and electronics cabinets.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fN5L9.gif" alt="image of Self Adusting Leveling feet"br emImage source Edmund Optics.

Checkout the HiRise by Twelve South as reviewed by MacWorld. Boom iMac and Display = Level.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/g5fuB.jpg" alt="HiRise by Twelve South: MacWorld"     Mac accessory maker Twelve South has introduced the HiRise for iMac, a stand that lets users elevate their desktop Mac monitors to a better viewing level.      The $80 device is designed to support all generations of Mac that have an L-shaped stand, including the largest 27-inch displays on the latest generation of iMacs. The stand itself looks a little bit like an older, metal-shelled hard drive—a reminder of the days when drives and displays were separate components of the same computer.    <answer76609> There's the LapWorks 10" Heavy Duty Swivel:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a25Mn.jpg" alt=""   Used under the Thunderbolt monitor, levels the two perfectly and makes the the Thunderbolt monitor nice and swively.  <answer96622> This is such a massive oversight by the apple design team, I myself use books to prop up the display, just had to find the right combo.  Good luck  <answer169935> Just saw this post, as I was looking for an answer to the same question. Discovered that two old desktop drives fit nicely side-by-side under the 27 inch thunderbolt monitor. Raises it almost perfectly with the iMac screen and provide plenty of stability.  <comment47967> Bonus: Bryson books are usually pretty funny reads. <comment47973> And now I'm thinking it would cool to take that extended aluminum riser and incorporate an iPhone dock into the front edge. So many possibilities. <comment47974> Not only is it Bill Bryson, it's Thunderbolt compatible. Double win. <comment48029> The Ergotron Neo-Flex VESA mount is affordable and reliable. It sits on a desktop and requires no drilling or bolting. Check to make sure that they have a model large enough for a 27-inch monitor. http://www.ergotron.com/ <comment48030> Here's the appropriate Neo-Flex model. http://goo.gl/xbLSM It costs US $150 as list price but you might find discounted prices. The advantage is that you can raise or lower the display, or tilt or even rotate it, to any degree you need to. <comment48191> So much win here! <comment48199> This actually didn't work – the book is about .3 inches too thin (did you mean to recommend the hard cover?). For now I'm using http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321, which is about .25 inches too thick lol! <comment48200> Yeah, whoops – according to Amazon the softcover is 1" thick and the hardcover 1.2" thick. Looks like we need another book! <comment48967> This is a terrifying solution! <comment48968> You're afraid of peel-n-stick adhesive? ;) <comment48970> That stuff leaves a residue behind that will linger forever :-) Much scarier than drilling into your monitor. <comment48971> Okay, in my defense I was suggesting you could drill into the **base** of the monitor. <comment76929> I don't think that backup battery is good enough for that setup. You probably need a gas generator for it.
