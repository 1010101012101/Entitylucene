system won't play mp3s anymore <body> I was writing programs using https://github.com/Marak/play.js/blob/master/lib/play.js  after running it a few times my system no longer plays mp3s either on the command line or vlc, other sound works fine.  Has anyone ever had this problem before? How do I fix it?  <comment28527> I believe now the problem is all sound. i restarted chrome after i noticed the mp3 issue and its not playing any sound either. I think I killed a core system module or something <comment28528> Can you post more info on what you did specifically? Its weird that with a javascript library you managed to kill sound from VLC. What OS are you using? Have you tried restarting your computer? <comment28535> restart fixed it, the javascript lib is directly interfacing with command line mp3 client so its a bit of a red herring, thinking maybe i should have left that part out. Still curious what caused it
