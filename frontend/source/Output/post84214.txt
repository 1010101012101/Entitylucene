Embedding Web Snippets in Wiki Server and Security Settings <body> I want to edit the embed security settings in Mountain Lion Server's Wiki Service because with the default settings you can't embed anything on pages, which makes it a lot less useful. We're in a school environment where embedding flash apps, video etc. is the norm - and Wiki Server will normally strip out these tags from web snippets for security reasons.   img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ppG4.png" alt="What happens when the embed tags aren&#39;t permitted"  I seems that to do this you change:  precode/Library/Server/Wiki/Config/whitelist.plist  /code/pre  but I'm not sure how to change it to allow all types of embeds. I'm aware of the security risks but I trust my users on this Server to embed what they need to embed.  <answer84216> I found the Lion Server Advanced Admin Guide which mentioned changing the key  codeFiltersEnabled/code to codeFalse/code code/etc/collabd/collabd.plist/code.  Once I figured that this plist has been moved to /Library/Server/Wiki/Config in Mountain Lion Server from /etc/collabd/ in Lion Server I changed the preference - and we can embed to our hearts' content.
