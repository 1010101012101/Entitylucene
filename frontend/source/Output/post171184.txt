Tool to transform text to all caps or lowercase <body> Is there a system-wide text manipulation app that enables you to select text and convert all letters to upper case or lower case, like a code text editor would?  Also, this is certainly wishful thinking but having a multi-cursor functionality across OSX (like Cmd + D in Sublime Text) would be amazing.  <answer171196> You can set this up as a right click service in automator as @Matthieu Riegler suggested.  Open up Automator.app and create a “Service” with this workflow.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/n1BT9.png" alt="enter image description here"  Pay close attention to the checkbox up top, “Output replaces selected test”.  After the workflow is in place and saved, navigate to “System Preferences--Keyboard.”  On the left hand side select “Services”.  On the right hand side you will see the Service you created, in the example its saved as “UpperCase”.  Then give it a shortcut by pressing “Add Shortcut” and give it what you would like.  Tested in TestWrangler and TextEdit.  Script used in Automator:  precodeon run {input, parameters} set upperCaseString to ¬     (do shell script ("echo " &amp; input &amp; " | tr a-z A-Z;")) return upperCaseString end run /code/pre  <answer171217> I am on Mountain Lion 10.8.5 and for all editable text I can select and right click the text and choose codeTransformations -&gt; Make Upper Case/code.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MQxbz.png" alt="enter image description here"  However, it seems this does not work in all applications. TextWrangler for example does not show this menu. All system applications (Finder, TextEdit, Mail, Calendar, etc…) all do.  <answer212489> I had the same struggle so I create a one button app that solves this problem. It looks like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z12Tj.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Lowly Mac App"  You'll find the Lowly app here :)   <answer212978> Another tool that I use is strongPopClip/strong  The application can transform selected text to UPPERCASE or even Proper Case or lowercase.  There are several settings for search and other context relevant actions.  I am not affiliated with the developer.  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Dd8t.png" alt="PopClip Settings"  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/b5cLV.png" alt="PopClip context"  This is a sample based editing this answer... hr / img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w1OIB.png" alt="PopClip in context using selected text"  <comment201386> An automator service could do this trick. It can be accessed from the contextual menu of the textboxes. <comment201399> That's enough for 'English' language, but you can also add diacritical translation, like so  set upperCaseString to ¬   (do shell script ("echo " & input & " | tr a-zäáà A-ZÄÁÀ;"))  add an specials to your list like ä, ß and so on
