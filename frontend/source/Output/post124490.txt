Time Machine backup of renamed computer fails <body> After getting a new MacBook Pro recently, I decided to reuse my old MacBook Pro as a home server. I reformatted the disk and reinstalled OS X, giving the computer a different hostname (let's call it emNewHostname/em) in the process.   Now I want to back up the computer to the same Time Capsule I was using before. However, there is already an encrypted backup of the computer on that Time Capsule from when it was still called emOldHostname/em. When I try to set up Time Machine, it returns an error message saying strong"The disk "DiskName" already contains an encrypted backup for this computer."/strong This appears to be referring to the old sparsebundle image.   The only options Time Machine offers are to continue using the old sparsebundle or to erase it and start a new encrypted backup. Is there any way I could keep the old sparsebundle emand/em start a new backup? And how does it even know that this encrypted file happens to correspond to this computer when the hostnames don't even match?  Note: I've already tried renaming the file in Finder from emOldHostname.sparsebundle/em to emOldHostname-old.sparsebundle/em, but that didn't work.  <answer124521> Try to use codetmutil inheritbackup/code:  precodesudo tmutil inheritbackup /Volumes/Data/OldHostname.sparsebundle /code/pre  From codeman tmutil/code:  precodeinheritbackup {machine_directory | sparsebundle}         Claim a machine directory or sparsebundle for use by the current         machine. Requires root privileges.          Machine directories and sparsebundles are owned by one computer         at a time, and are tracked by unique identifiers rather than com-         puter name, host name, or ethernet address. The inheritbackup         verb reassigns the identity of the specified item, reconfiguring         it so the current host recognizes it during backups. When inher-         iting a sparsebundle, the machine directory within will also be         claimed.          Inheriting is typically only one step in the process of configur-         ing a backup for use by a machine. You may also need to use         setdestination, associatedisk, or both, depending on the situa-         tion.          One machine can own multiple machine directories and sparsebun-         dles, but it is ill-advised for them to reside in the same place.         In such a situation, which will be chosen during a backup is         undefined. As a result, inheritbackup will attempt to detect pos-         sible identity collisions before making changes. /code/pre  See also http://pondini.org/TM/B6.html.  <comment145650> There is probably some hardware id's stored for the disk. Anyway you can try move it into a folder to get it out of the way and save it. <comment145697> @Hoshts: I didn't expect that Time Machine would let me move the backup, so I didn't even think to try it. But I just did it now and it actually worked and solved the problem perfectly. Thanks! <comment145698> This actually seems to do the opposite of what I was looking for as it _assigns_ the backup to the computer, rather than _un-assigning_ it. Still, it's interesting that erasing the old volume in the OS X installer didn't change the UUID as they suggested it would.
