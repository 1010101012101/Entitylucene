Time Machine backup not progressing <body> I'm experiencing issues running backup on an external encrypted USB 3.0 HDD. The backup starts and stop proceeding random. I'd tried to wait many hours without any progress.  For example in these screenshot the backup stops at 93KB. The previous try was froze at 4,79GB. img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lQN7D.png" alt="Time Machine backup not progressing"  I was unable to get errors or warning in Console log, everything seems fine.  I'd also tried to:  ul liCheck disk integrity and file permission on boot SSD and backup HDD. Everything is ok./li liDisable Spotlight on backup disk./li /ul  MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), OS X version: El Capitan 10.11.1  Content of in progress backup log file at code/Volumes/MBPMG TM/Backups.backupdb/MBPMG/2015-11-05-185944.inProgress/code:  precodePreflight complete for "Macintosh HD" (device: /dev/disk1 mount: '/' fsUUID: 95051367-459C-3316-8660-517D5DF0D65B eventDBUUID: 1F1B141B-7157-4E86-8E13-713DC143E3A8) Time elapsed: 9 minutes, 23.000 seconds  Processing preflight info         Space needed for this backup: 8.7 GB (2124855 blocks of size 4096)         Preserving last snapshot /Volumes/MBPMG TM/Backups.backupdb/MBPMG/2015-11-02-074119 Finished processing preflight info  Copying items from "Macintosh HD" (device: /dev/disk1 mount: '/' fsUUID: 95051367-459C-3316-8660-517D5DF0D65B eventDBUUID: 1F1B141B-7157-4E86-8E13-713DC143E3A8) c :ERROR:-128, copy / to /Volumes/MBPMG TM/Backups.backupdb/MBPMG/2015-11-05-185944.inProgress/FA10A52E-6ACE-4398-85B1-E4CCED76DEA5 Finished copying items for "Macintosh HD" (device: /dev/disk1 mount: '/' fsUUID: 95051367-459C-3316-8660-517D5DF0D65B eventDBUUID: 1F1B141B-7157-4E86-8E13-713DC143E3A8) Time elapsed: 13 hours, 17 minutes, 17.000 seconds         Copied 13233 items (1.55 GB)         Copy stage canceled  Backup canceled.

I struggle... <comment278239> I solved this strange behaviour simply rebooting the system and restarting the backup. It seems like something went wrong with some processes inside OS X. It still happening with or without FileVault encryption enabled on TM volume.
