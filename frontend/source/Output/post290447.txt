Macbook Pro doesn't detect camera when connected to Apple Display <body> My MBP doesn't detect the Apple display camera when it is plugged into the display, with the lid closed. I know the display works because a different MBP plugged into it has no problems AND my MBP can detect the camera when plugged into a different display.  Symptoms: When I open an app like Facetime, it says "No Camera Available". When I open up System Information, the only camera that shows up is the one from the MBP (FaceTime HD Camera).  OSX 10.11.6 on 13" Early 2015 MBP
