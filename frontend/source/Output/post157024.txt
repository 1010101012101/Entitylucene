Adobe Flash Substitute <body> I am on a flight that requires Adobe flashplayer if I want to watch movies. I have an Ipad 2 and wonder if there is another Apple app that will work?   <answer157028> Puffin Browser (free with limitations, 99¢ to subscribe for 6 months)  Photon Flash Player ($9.99)  You could also use many remote desktop applications to stream from a desktop PC or Mac. Probably doesn't help much on a flight, though.  Source: http://www.computerworld.com/article/2599798/apple-ios/how-to-run-flash-on-your-ipad-if-you-must.html  <comment184639> I'm missing something. Why does the flight require flash?? <comment184649> Out of interest, which Airline is it offering on board entertainment using WiFi? <comment192719> @Buscar웃 They all do <comment192720> @ghoppe The flight doesn't require flash, watching movies does.  Take, for example, YouTube - plays videos using Adobe Flash <comment193566> @cullub YouTube has offered an [HTML5 player](https://www.youtube.com/html5) that doesn't require flash for five years now. <comment193766> Wow I'm behind the times!  I didn't know that - must've gotten stuck back in 2010 or so.
