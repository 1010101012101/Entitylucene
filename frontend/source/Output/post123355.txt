Faster than cmd+Tab way for app switching? <body> Is there a faster way to switch between currently-open applications on the Mac than using kbdcmd/kbd+kbdTab/kbd/kbdcmd/kbd+kbdShift/kbd+kbdTab/kbd?  I tend to have a lot of different apps open at a time and I have to keep switching between three-to-four of these apps all the time. And having to repeatedly hit cmd+tab,tab,tab seems like a waste of keystrokes. It would be nice if there was a faster way to achieve this application-switching.  This does not have to be built-in Mac functionality. I'd like to know about any app that does this job better.  PS: I'm running Mavericksbr / PPS: I'm looking for a keyboard shortcut and not a mouse-related solution.  Thanks! :)  <answer123357> Here is a personnal suggestion : Use the power of Mission control.   I link to a mouse button (lateral wheel click) show All Windows / show application windows . With that shortcut it's realy fast to just from one Window/App to another.   hr  Edit: Didn't saw your PPS. But Mission control is still a nice way to handle multiple apps/windows !   Other possibility, you could link a keyboard shortcut to an automator service which would switch to a particular app.   <answer123368> Give a try to QuickSilver, which lets you switch to or open apps and various other things through keyboard only.  <answer123474> You can use KeyRemap4MacBook to for example turn the right option into an extra modifier key for opening applications:  precode&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;root&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;vkopenurldef&gt;     &lt;name&gt;KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_SAFARI&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;url&gt;file:///Applications/Safari.app&lt;/url&gt;   &lt;/vkopenurldef&gt;   &lt;item&gt;     &lt;name&gt;test&lt;/name&gt;     &lt;identifier&gt;test&lt;/identifier&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::OPTION_R, KeyCode::VK_MODIFIER_EXTRA1&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::F, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_FINDER&lt;/autogen&gt;     &lt;autogen&gt;__KeyToKey__ KeyCode::S, ModifierFlag::EXTRA1, KeyCode::VK_OPEN_URL_SAFARI&lt;/autogen&gt;   &lt;/item&gt; &lt;/root&gt; /code/pre  See http://osxnotes.net/keyremap4macbook.html for more examples.  If you have bought the Powerpack for Alfred 2, you can use workflows like this:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rQDBm.png" alt=""  Hotkeys have a short delay by default, but you can reduce it by changing the trigger behavior:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKDfp.png" alt=""  <answer207461> This is a really old question but just thought I would add to it anyway!  I use apptivate.  Really simple toolbar app that can open/switch to almost anything with custom keyboard shortcuts.  <comment144027> Thanks for the suggestion Matthieu. Do you have any examples for the automator-service you suggest? <comment144032> Ah yes. I use Alfred but hadn't thought about using the launcher to instead switch to an already launched application. (Silly me!). On an average it's actually more key-strokes than cmd+tabbing but at least do not have to look at the screen to check if I've to tab left and right or count the number of tabs I've to make. I guess this is the quickest way yet. Thanks Edouard! :) <comment144233> I switch using command-1, command-2, etc; and have particular apps on particular desktops (and told Mavericks not to rearrange the desktops). <comment144794> I love this idea and I think this is the fastest for me given that I know I have just 4-5 applications that I regularly switch between. Thank you! <comment250225> and it is free!
