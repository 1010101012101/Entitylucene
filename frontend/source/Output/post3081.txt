High quality USB microphone that works on the iPhone 4 <body> Can you recommend a high quality USB microphone that works on the iPhone 4? (Apparently there are issues with the iPhone 4 and USB microphones)  <answer3085> By "there are issues with the iPhone 4 and USB microphones," are you referring to the fact that no one has ever gotten them to work together?  The iPad, yes—but not the iPhone 4.  (Which, I think, answers the question about which mic I recommend…)  <answer33139> It looks like the Tascam IM2 is the only game in town (and just released). Its features are 125dB SPL, 95dB S/N, 20Hz-20kHz, if eBay listings are believable.  <comment2722> Do USB devices even work at all with the iPhone? <comment2734> Is it that bad? Well, I'll keep the question open, this may be resolved when iOS 4.2 is released. <comment5273> 4.2 is released
