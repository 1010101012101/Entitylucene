Move the note icons around in Preview? <body> I have added an note to a PDF file in Preview, and the yellow icon is covering up some text, but I can't move it away by dragging:  img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/KYlRR.jpg" alt=""  Any ideas?  <answer168375> You can move the note icon by clicking on the selection tool (its looks like a square with dotted corners) and then clicking and dragging the icon to the area of your liking.  <answer204477> Also, make sure that you aren't in highlighting mode (click off the highlight tool at the top of the page) - you can't move the note around when you're highlighting.   <comment339493> So intuitive, someone really spent a lot of time on this feature.
