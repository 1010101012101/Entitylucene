Cisco AnyConnect prevents Continuity from allowing Mac to answer iPhone <body> One of the nicest features of the new OS integration between iOS 8 and Yosemite is the ability to text and receive phone calls from my iPhone while on my Mac.   However, when I work from home, I need to use Cisco AnyConnect to create a VPN network. When the VPN network is active, I can see phone calls from my iPhone on my Mac, but answering the call on my Mac will cause the call to disconnect. Trying to call from my Mac will show the dialog box that I am connecting, but the iPhone never responds. If I am on a call on my Mac, and start up the VPN, the call disconnects.  I have a 2014 13" MacBook Pro and an iPhone 5S both running the latest OS with all the patches.  What is going on, and is there a way to fix the problem?  <answer159398> Cisco's VPN software typically locks out all local LAN access.  In other words, your Mac is no longer on your network.  It is now tunneled into your VPN connection.  <answer269276> It doesn't depend on the client software that you use (Shimo or AnyConnect) but rather on the AnyConnect Profile used to establish connection. In my case I've got two profiles available (one that routes all the traffic via the VPN server and another one that routes selected subnets only). In both cases iPhone calls continuity fails when VPN is on. With VPN off, everything works.  <comment187394> Well, that (what's the technical term? oh yeah...) sucks. I bet the Bluetooth network sees my iPhone which is why my Mac can spot it and tell me a call is coming through, but the call itself is handled via WiFi. I used [Shimo](http://www.chungwasoft.com/shimo/) a while ago when the Mac's VPN wouldn't work and Cisco didn't have a decent Mac client. Maybe I'll give that another try.
