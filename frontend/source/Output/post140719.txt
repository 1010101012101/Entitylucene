Windows 8 computer is not recognizing iPhone 4 <body> I just restarted my iPhone so it says that i have to plug it in to iTunes, i have downloaded the new version but it is not being recognized. I am using and old 3rd generation iPod nano cord if that makes any difference. i have tried uninstalling and re-installing iTunes but nothing has helped.  <answer140721> I'd say there are some posibilites that could cause issues like this.br What Computer are you connecting to?br Did you tried it with another machine?br THe probblem accured just after resetting your phone?br Any known other issues reagrding your USB-Hub?br  <comment165817> This is the second computer i started using. the first was my Windows Vista that had the old iTunes (unsure of which one but i stopped using that computer last August if that's any help) and it was updating fine but when i updated to the new iTunes it all of a sudden stopped working. So i reset the phone thinking that it would fix the problem but it has only created more. i am unable to do anything with the phone now. It's a Windows 8 laptop. My laptop doesnt even recognize my iPhone as an iphone. <comment165821> What do you mean by 'restarted'? Rebooting an iPhone doesn't require connection to iTunes and neither does a restored iPhone since the PC-free iOS 5 update.
