Can I safely backup my system by simply tarring things? <body> Of course, the recommended method of backing up an OSX machine is to use Time Machine. But let's say that, for whatever reason, I'm deadset on doing it myself.  If I simply tar up things I care about (my user directory, /Applications, Application Support, Libraries etc), and later extract them to a fresh OSX install, will everything work? I know I have to use explicit flags to preserve ownership and permissions, but assuming I do that, does codetar/code completely preserve all the metadata OSX wants like resource forks and all the rest of it?  <answer199286> Time Machine would probably be easier and or better then using codetar/code as there is no mention in the man page that it will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information.  *See Edit below.  codeditto/code does and more... From it's man page:     strongditto/strong will preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information when copying unless instructed other- wise using strong−−norsrc/strong .   Similarly, strongditto/strong will preserve extended attributes and Access   Control Lists (ACLs) unless strong−−noextattr/strong or strong−−noacl/strong is passed.   DITTONORSRC can be set in the environment as an alias to strong−−norsrc    −−noextattr −−noacl/strong on the command line.   strongEdit:/strong  While the codetar/code man page did not specifically mention "preserve resource forks and HFS meta-data information" like strongditto/strong did nonetheless I'd suggest testing codetar/code and see if it will meet your needs.  I just did a preliminary test on a modified folder that contains a customized image for the folder and it did archive the associated meta-data, at least some of it anyway.  That is to say I didn't test against codeditto/code for comparison nor does that folder have ACL's, etc.  strongEdit 2:/strong Considering the comment you made as to why you wanted to use codetar/code and after tests between codeditto/code and codetar/code I'd say codetar/code is probably going to meet your needs.  In either case I like redundancy and I do a Time Machine Backup as well as some other form of archival.  I do a separate image of my Home folder every once in a while to a compressed .dmg file.  <answer199301> There's also a command codehdiutil/code which can be used to make a single dmg file from a directory, and the HFS flags are all preserved.   <comment238817> Ditto will copy the files and folders fine, but the problem is, I'm not necessarily storing the backups on an HFS+ drive. In fact, I want to split them to 4GiB chunks so that I can transfer them on FAT32 in a pinch. Thus the need to tar them up. <comment238818> @user280993, That is why I did a test and edited my answer.  See edited answer and then do some testing to confirm `tar` meets your needs.  Sorry I was going primarily by info in the man pages and they are not alway well written. <comment238819> ah okay I see your edit. I'll test tar thoroughly. Thanks <comment238834> You should be careful about blindly overwriting /Applications, the system libraries, etc because if your fresh install is a newer version than what you backed up, it will very likely lead to trouble. <comment238872> @user280993 ditto can create CPIO archives compressed with gzip, bzip2, or PKZip. Yet another tool you could consider using is pax.
