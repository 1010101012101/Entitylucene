iOS 7 activation problem <body> I just updated to iOS 7 but now I can't activate my phone. What's going on? I have turned it off plenty of times but the phone still has no network connection. It keeps saying no service.  <answer102233> If you plug the phone into iTunes, you might get a better error as well as confirmation that it's not just the device itself that's failing to activate (or failing to establish a network connection).  It's likely the activation servers cannot service all the request they are receiving today.  <comment120394> http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/102171/is-it-normal-for-ios-updates-to-fail-or-to-take-hours-on-launch-day <comment297623> Did you tried to use WIFI? Or use a hotspot of some friend to activate?
